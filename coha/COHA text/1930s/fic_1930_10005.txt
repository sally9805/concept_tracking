entered behind Hobomok , who took a pipe from a shelf at the far end of the cabin , filled it , and gave it to me while Cap looked on , grumbling . Then he turned from us without a word and left the cabin . " Now what ails this ill-begotten bug-eater ? " asked Cap petulantly ; but in that moment Hobomok entered the cabin again , closing the door behind him . As we looked at him he seemed to grow upward until he near touched the roof , and his face was hideously distorted . He took three short steps toward us , rising and falling , and dragging his legs from the ground with difficulty , like a man dragging himself through a snowdrift . I could feel Cap , breathing hard , fumbling at his waist ; and I knew that he fumbled for his leather-bound musket balls . Before he could reach them a most dreadful convulsion swept Hobomok 's face and body . His eyes bulged from his head , and from his contortedmouth there came a shriek so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , it came against me like a great clammy hand , lifting the hair above my ears and drawing frozen fingers along my spine , and paining my ears as though one of my sisters ' steel knitting needles had been plunged into each of them . Then immediately he turned from us and went out . I looked at Cap , and found him staring glassy-eyed at the door , his hands lax at his sides and his mouth half open . I have heard my father say that when a good m'Icoulin screamed unexpectedly in a room , no person in that room was able to move for a considerable space of time ; and it may be that the strange walk of the m'teoulin , followed suddenly by his scream , first holds and then numbs the attention of those who hear him . It may be , indeed , not unlike that which happens to a hen when a boy holds her beak against a fair white board , draws with a piece of charcoal a long straight line from the tip of the beak outward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against it . The hen remains there , helpless and unmoving ; and so , too , did Cap stand until I had twice shaken his arm . During the rest of the day he was quieter than he was wont to be , frequently looking quickly over his shoulder . What he thought of the matter he ( lid not say , nor did I ask him ; for I cared not what he thought so long as he kept his hands away from my friends and caused them no distress . It may have been his fancy for Jacataqua , and it may have been Hobo/mok 's scream ; but whatever the cause , he called no Indian either lousy or ill-begotten during the remainder of the time we were together until he had first looked over his shoulder to see whether he could be overheard. * * *What with the vagueness of Colonel Arnold 's orders , and ( general Washington 's mislike for Indians , and the low opinion which both these great officers held concerning my thoughts upon the question of bateaux , I scarce knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet I knew that , though I considered myself better than a fair hand with a paddle or an oar , I would no more think of navigating the upper Kennebec without Indians who knew the waters and the country than I would think of traveling to Boston without breeches ; for these are very wild regions , so tumbled and torn that to call them " wild " means nothing to any man who has not struggled through them . Therefore I said to myself that I would do for Colonel Arnold what I would do for myself if I should be essaying the trip. jacataqua promised that moose-hide moccasins would be made , until they had used all the moose hides in the camp ; likewisebuckskin hunting shirts , though she feared there would be few of them . These , she said , she would deliver to Colonel Arnold aboard the vessel in which he should come up the Kennebec ; and she gave her word that she and the other women would continue working on them until the first sloop appeared around Abagadasset Point . Regarding warriors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the tribe had been greatly weakened by departures to St. Francis . He himself would go , he said , and Natawammet , and t wo or three of their young men ; but the remainder must stay to hunt for the women and children ; and this I knew to be true , for there is no tribe of Abenakis that can exist in any way except by hunting . When I told Hobomok how Paul Higgins had promised me t he help of thirty men , he said that we would paddle up the Androscogginon the following day ; but Cap Huff declared that he would wedge himself into no canoe unless from necessity , and that he would remain on Swan Island to supervise the making of the moccasins . I knew not what to think about his apparent desire to remain near Jacataqua ; but while I was turning over in my mind what I should say to him about it , and Cap was snip ing at the odors of the feast that the women were preparing , there came a beating of paddles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loud shouts for Jacataqua . These shouts , Hobomok told us sadly , were raised by two young white men from Pownalborough , great rum-guzzlers , as indeed were all the settlers , Hobomok said , in the towns along the Ken nebec . It was because of the rum more than anything else , he declared , that the braves were taking their squaws and their sons and their daughters and departing for St. Francis ; for when the white men came to see the Abenaki girls , which they often did , they brought rum for the young men , so that there was more drinking than ever before , very bad drinking ; for when Indians drink they are not quiet and orderly about it , but wish to drink all the rum in the world , and often , therefore , becomevery ferocious , breaking each other 's arms and legs and drowning each other in the river . Nor would it help matters , he pointed out , to kill any of the white men who brought rum to them ; for they could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by all the white men in the land . Jacataqua came to Hobomok in the midst of the shouting and paddle-beating , asking him what she should do ; and it was not hard to see that she was uneasy over the matter . With this Gap Huff engulfed her in the hollow of his arm , so that she looked as though she were resting against a half-lowered mainsail , and said that if it was made worth his while he would see what could be done about it . Jacataqua giggled and blew noisily in his ear , and he stumbled at once toward the guzzle in the dusk , pawing at his belt for his new plaything made out of musket balls . We heard a deal of noisy conversation thereafter , but nothing that we could make out , and soon these sounds faded away into the distance , accompanied by an occasional paddle splash , so that we knew Cap had departed with the two young men from Pownalborough . Thus I was spared the labor of deciding what to say to him ; for we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sign of him when Hobomok and I departed for the country of the Assagunticookson the following morning . Yet I could not bring myself to worry about him , since I knew full well that he had got along without me for many years , and had probably pulledp253himself out of more scrapes than had been enjoyed by any eight lions of Liberty yet unhung . Indeed , I was grateful that he had gone off on other affairs , for we paddled up the Androscoggin in a cold drizzle from the northeast ; and when we had reached the foot of the falls we found no Abenaki camp at all , but learned from a birch-bark writing on a tree that it had been removed to the southern end of Cobosseecontee Pond , which lies between the Androscoggin and the Kennebec . I misdoubted that Cap would have taken any pleasure in this situation , so long as he had Jacataqua in his mind , and I was glad to be relieved of his grumbling and growling , being none too happy myself over pushing on to Cobosseecontee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forests that I had near forgotten the first thing that any woodsman learns : that each day should be a day to itself , without regard for the disappointments or plans of other days ; for if a huntsman begins to dwell on the sum of all his disappointments he will soon go mad and shoot himself instead of striving to shoot animals . Even when we had labored on to Cobosseecontee and threaded our way around its winding shores until we had come to the Abenakicamp , we found our troubles multiplied , for the camp held only women and boys and old men . We smoked a pipe with the old men and learned that Reuben Colburn had paddled in from Gardinerstown and made a talk with Paul Higgins , persuading him to travel to Cambridge with his warriors and offer his servicesto the great chief Washington . Higgins , they said , had at first refused , saying that he had promised his help to me ; whereuponColburn had told him , and rightly , too , I thought , that he would obtain more credit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have would also come from the great chief in Cambridge . As a result of this , Hobomok and I sat down with them on the shores of Cobosseecontee to shoot deer and raccoons and clucks and await Paul Higgins ' return ; for knowing General Washington 's opinion of Indians , I suspicioned that Higgins might be received in Cambridge without overmuch courtesy , and that his help might therefore be withheld from us at a time of need . On the afternoon of our third day of waiting Hobomok and IP254had returned from across the pond with two fine bucks and were busying ourselves over them on the shore , surrounded by gabblingsquaws and noisy boys , when a silence fell on all of them and the women went scuttling off into the bushes like so many chickens when a hawk swings overhead . We looked up in surprise and found Paul Higgins , clad only in his leggins and belt cloth , standing silently on the bank with his hands on his hips , gloweringat me instead of leaping down to thump me on the back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abenakis , all as gloomy as though they had returned from a hunt on which they had slain nothing but two chickadees and an owl . Thus 1 knew that I had been correct in my suspicions , so I made a great to-do over him , saying nothing at all about war , but dwellingon the feast that we would have with the venison and raccoon fat that I had got for him with my musket while awaiting him , and going at once for the hand mirrors and awls and scissors that I had brought as gifts  --  gifts that Paul needed greatly , for it had been long since he had trimmed his hair or beard , or the hair on his chest , so that he looked as much like a walking juniper bush as a man . I had ever liked Paul Higgins , despite the sneers of his white neighbors who pretended to find fault with him because he was overly free in his marrying habits , marrying a squaw one year and putting her aside after the lapse of three or four years ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complaint among the squaws ; and I had reason to believe that some of the white men who were bitterest against him would have done the same , if marriage customs among us had been as lenient as those of the Abenakis . Having been taken by the Indians when he was a small child , he had few of the evil habits of many white men of my acquaintance , being neither foul-mouthed over nothing , nor a drunkard , nor given to spreading malicious reports concerning his neighbors . For that matter , there was little of the white roan about him , save when he was careless about his hair and beard ; f or he had been browned by exposure to the sun for many years , and he spoke with the softness of the Abenakis instead of with the nasal rasp of our own people . At all events , I took pleasure in his company ; and knowing1p255this , he soon ceased to bear a grudge against me for his misfortunes , so that we feasted together in harmony . Later , when we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his journey to Cambridge . With him , he said , had gone nineteen of his own braves , as well as Swashan , a sachem from St. Francis who had come to offer his help against the English . When they were admitted to the presence of the great chief Washington , he said , he had spoken quickly and to the point , saying that they had lived at peace with their neighbors for many years , supporting themselves from the country ; and now having been told that the freedom of this land was at stake , they offered themselves to assist in preserving it as it was . " When the great chief had heard us , " said Paul , pulling rapidly at his pipe and speaking in Abenaki so that the others could understand him , " lie thanked us in fine words , and told us that if there was need for our services he would send us word . Then he let my braves come away without food or drink or presents . Yet I know that he is sending an army against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us now there is no need for us ever . We are very bitter about this , my brothers and I ; and it sits ill on us to be held in such low esteem . " For my ears he added angrily , in English , " Let them go to hell in their own way ! " I could not blame Paul for his anger , knowing how I would have felt if I had offered my services and had them put aside in this manner ; neither , knowing a few of the difficulties of the road we must travel , could I let him be lost to us if there was any way of holding him . Therefore , though I had liefer try to sing under water than to speak in public , I knew that I must make the attempt , so I got to my feet with the perspiration standing thick on me . " Brothers , " I said , " many years ago I heard my father speak of war to the white chief who will lead this army against Quebec . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making war was better than the white man 's method . and that white men . in making war , seemed ever to seek an excuse to follow unwise counsels . " Brothers , the white chief Washington is a very great chief , just and fearless , but he has taken had counsel . He has takenp256the counsel of men who pretend to know the river Kennebee and its ways , and who do not know it . Those who have given this advice have told him to use bateaux for the carrying of fool and stores , instead of canoes . I have said to him , Brothers , that canoes are better than bateaux , but the advice that he has had seems better than mine , and that is the advice that he will follow , Now this is something that is done , and it can not be changed ; so it is no longer my business to go about weeping because bateauxare being used . My business is to go in a bateau . " Another thing , Brothers : many years ago the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dians . This is a matter that I put upon my tongue with little pleasure , but I do it so that you may know I speak the truth to you , as my father spoke it to the Abenakis . The great chief does not know the Abenakis of the Kennebec and the Androscoggin as I know them and as my father knew them ; and I ask my brothers if it would not be better to find some way of letting this knowledge be known to all the world , rather than to sulk like children because the great chief has reason to believe that all red men are like the red dogs of the West . " With this I sat down , quaking internally and hoping very strongly that the St. Francis chief , Swashan , would be silent , but fearing that he would not be because his conscience was too vulnerable . No sooner was I down than he was on his feet , very important and indignant . " Can my brother give this counsel , " he demanded , " when he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many tens of years ? A slight has been put upon the honor of my tribe With this I broke the rules of Abenaki speech and scrambled to my feet , hot with anger . " I will answer my brother before he goes farther than is wise , " I said to him , keeping my temper with difficulty . " My brother knows that the St. Francis Abenakis were a thistle under the belt of all New England for many years , when my friends of the Androscoggin and the Kennebec were living at peace with us and suffering unjustly for things for which their St. Francis brothers were to blame ! " " Micmacs : Etechemins from the Penobscot : Passamaquod - dies ! " broke in Swashan , glowering at me . " St. Francis Indians ! " I said to him . " Ask Hobomok ! AskP257Paul Higgins ! In their time I had this , " and I struck the red scar on my forehead , " because Indians from St. Francis murdered my neighbor and stole his daughter . " " Led by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said , " led by a Frenchman . But what did . we care who led them ? Murderers led by a hangman are no worse than murderers led by a priest . Within our memories your people of St. Francis have done things against which we arc still bitter . All the more reason , then , that you should cease to babble of your honor and look for a way to put yourself right before the world . " They were silent for a time , staring at me with black , glitteringeyes . I could feel that they were pleased rather than angry at my attack on Swashan , and were turning over in their minds how they could save their pride and still , as I had suggested , set themselves right with the world . At the same time , in the bottom of my mind , I knew that whatever they did , no matter how brave or self-sacrificing , they were doomed forever to be naught but Indians to most  --  one with Mohawks and Micmacs ; Sacs and Shawanoes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winnebagoes , and the rest of the red crew of hell . I also knew that I could abandon the idea of seeking informationfrom Swashan ; for since he must mislike me , he would no doubt lie to me . " Brother , " said Paul at length , " the great chief did not want us . This we can not forget or change . " " Brother , " I said , " that is not the question . The question is this : If an army marches to Quebec by the Kennebec , does it need you ? If it needs you and you do not give it help , then I may think what I please , and it will please me to think that you offered help to further your private ends , and not to help this country and your white brothers . " Again there was silence while the braves , huddled in their blankets , watched me with glittering eyes . " I have traveled toward Quebec , " I said , " with Hobomok and Natawammet and Woromquid , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and helped by them . The army that is going to Quebec will need the help of every Indian on this river . " Paul Higgins shook his head . " I will not go with this army , "  | he said . " We have met coldness already , and I will not risk meetingopen disgrace . " I thought for a time . " Brother , " I said , " answer me a ques-tion . " Higgins nodded . " Soon , " I said , " it will be time to begin your autumn hunting . " Again he nodded . " Where shall you hunt ? " I asked . He waved his hand to the points of the compass . " Throughout the Abenaki country , " he said , " wherever our parties know there are deer and bear and beaver . " " Carrabassett ? " I asked . " Moosehead ? Carritunk ? " He nodded . " Dead River ? " I asked . " Some , " he agreed . " Paul , " I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Land . Go as soon as you are able , saying nothing to any man , and hunt on the Height of Land . When this army crosses the Height of Land it will either need you badly or need nobody 's help . If it needs nobody 's help , you have hunted on good hunting grounds ; and this you must do , as you well know , whatever happens . If it needs help , you will be there to give it . I ask this in the name of friendship . " " I think it will need help , " said Higgins . There was a murmur from the other braves , a murmur of assent . " I think , " said Higgins , " that I am willing to hunt on the Height of Land , though I have never been there . " A brave on the opposite side of the fire opened his mouth and howled furiously , rounding off the howl with a series of shrill yips . " I will hunt on the Height of Land , " he announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encumbrances . With that there was a general howling , significant of pleasure and approval , following which the fire was replenished and a Bragging Dance was held , with Swashan bragging more industriously than any three of the Assagunticooks put together .   IMPATIENT at the delay , Hobomok and I set off at dawn , following the winding sixteen-mile course of Cobosseecontee Stream and coming out into the Kennebec at Gardinerstown , six miles below Fort Western . Remembering the great estates of Dr. Sylvester Gardiner , and my father 's admiration for him , I asked Hobomok about him and learned that his sympathies were with England , like those of many other rich men , and that his estates had therefore been seized . On the Kennebec we found rafts of lumber being herded down river toward Reuben Colburn 's shipyard . We followed them down and soon heard a great whacking and pounding , and saw a tumult of activity on the eastern shore . When we pushed in for a closer look we found more Kennebec bateaux in process of construction than ever I had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards to white oak ribs and bawling at each other to keep out of the way and pass the nails . Of all the rowing boats that I know , I hold the Kennebec bateau in the lowest esteem , because of its great weight and the difficulty with which it is handled . On our part of the coast we have a boat for fishing that we call a dory : a high flat-sided boat with a narrow bottom , very clumsy-looking , but easy to row because of the small resistance to the water , and almost impossible to overturn , even by standing on the gunwale . The Kennebec bateau , which had its origin with the lumbermen of the lower Kennebec , is near double the size of our dories , and somewhat the same shape , the bow pointed and overhanging , the stern flattenedand less overhanging than the bow , but the side high and built of overlapping boards , whereas the sides of a dory are smooth , the boards being fitted tight together . To my mind , this overlapping of boards is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoals and reefs , since the boards catch easily against rocks , and there is more likelihood of leaks . I have noP26o doubt that it is as good a boat as any for lumbermen to use on the lower Kennebec , where the tides are swift and the rocks are few and the carrying of great loads is much to be desired ; but ott the upper Kennebec , where smooth water is well nigh unknown and quick movement is an essential to safety , I would as soon think of traveling in an overturned log cabin . Colburn was a brisk , chunky , quick man , very intelligent , but overdesirous , I thought , of doing everything himself to make sure that it was done properly . I had known others of a like temper , and it had seemed to me that they courted trouble by thinking that the things which they could not do themselves would of necessity be done badly . Expecting bad results , they would select their agents carelessly ; consequently their fears were more frequently justified than would have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had prepared myself to mislike Master Colburn as being responsible for Washington 's and Arnold 's fondness for bateaux ; but after I had shown him my letter from Colonel Arnold and we had fallen into conversation I saw that I had wronged him . When I said mildly that these craft were overly heavy for the work expected of them he kicked contemptuously at the side of one of them . " Green ! " he said . " All green boards ! Near as heavy as wet paper ! No seasoned lumber this side of Falmouth ! " He added that the time was so short he had not dared to bring seasoned planks from Falmouth by schooner . " If there 's delay , " he said , as we walked toward his house , " let it be at the other end ! Two hundred bateaux there 's got to be , and that 's what there 's going to be when Arnold gets here . " I said that it seemed to me there might be some delay if the green boards opened up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tapping me on the chest , " they want bateaux. and the only way we can give ' em bateaux is to build ' em out of green boards . What you got to say to that ? " I said that he might give them canoes as well . " Hah ! " he said . " They want bateaux and I give ' en ' canoes ! What happens then if aught goes wrong ? God ai n't to blame ! The weather ai n't to blame ! Reuben Colburn 's to blame ! Bad enough as it is , mister , building boats for an army . Will I get my moneyTHUNDERHEADS 261P261for ' ern ? God knows ! If we do n't whip England I wo n't . SylvesterGardiner 's got more brains than I 've got , and you notice he 's sticking with England . Well , I believe in ' em , mister , but I ai n't going to try to make ' em take things they do n't ask for . Not Reuben Colburn ! " " What got them so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me into the hall of his house , a fine , spacious dwelling on a rise at the bend in the river , looking down a great stretch , near a third of the distance to Swan Island . " Mister , " he said , " I wish I knew ; but Washington and Arnold , they keep their own counsels . " We went into a small room off the hall , where he rummaged in his desk and produced a letter from Colonel Arnold , which he tossed to me . SIR it started off : His excellency General Washington desires you will inform yourself how soon there can be procured or built at Kennebec two hundred light bateaux capable of carrying six or seven men each , with their provisions and baggage . " You see , " said Colburn , " they had the idea already . " I nodded , and noted , farther down in the letter , the order : You wild also get particular information from those people who have been at Quebec , of the difficulty attending an expedition that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places , whether dry land , hills , or swamp . Also the depth of water in the river at this season , whether an easy stream or rapid . " Did you get the particular information ? " I asked . " I sent four men from above Fort Western , " he said . " Conkey and Slike and two of their friends , with an Indian . " " To go to Quebec ? " I asked . " No , " he said , " to go to the Chaudiere and back , and see the state of things . They ought to be back by now . " There was a receipt in his desk , signed Patrick Conkey , ac-knowledgingt s pound salt Pork , rob pound Shipp Brad , / a Bushshall of Corn , 6 Gallons Rum for Journey toward Quebec . " Good men ? " I asked . " Good as any hereabouts , " said Colburn indifferently . " As good as Abenakis ? " I asked in surprise.  | " Well , " said Colburn. " you know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Me , I like Abenakis , but you know how General Washington feels about Indians . Anyway , they 'd feel safer having their reports come from white folks . " " I saw Paul Higgins , " I said . " He and his men say they wo n't go with the army . " Colburn nodded gravely . " What 's done 's done , " said he . " I got eight rounded tip to go along and paddle and carry messages . " " This Conkey ? " I asked . " How far can he travel on a gallon of rum ? " Colburn laughed . " These people up here , " he said defensively , " have got to have rum . They 'll go without corn and they 'll go without bread , if the price is too high , but you ca n't make the price of rum too high for ' em . " " Well , " I said , " they 're not much different down my way ; but what I 'm wondering is how much this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were loaded up with rum , and how straight they could see it and hear it . " " There 'll be no trouble , " said Colburn reassuringly . " It 's a plain trail , sticking to streams and ponds all the way . An army would n't scarcely need a guide . " " Have you been over it recently ? " I asked . " No , " said Colburn . " I have n't ever been over it , but I know about it from hearing people talk . " " Did you ever talk to anyone that had crossed the Height of Land ? " I asked . " Come to think of it , I do n't know as I ever did , " he said . " No , nor I , " I told him , " only to one man when I was a boy . There are n't any streams or ponds to follow on the Height of Land , and nobody goes near it unless he must . I 'll bet you a sable skin to a jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the Height of Land and never goes across it at all . " Colburn shook his head despairingly . " You ca n't get anything done nowadays , " he complained , " unless you do it yourself . Here I 've got to tend to making these bateaux and setting poles for ' em , and get sixty barrels of salt beef , and all the pork and flour on the river , and ride down to Falmouth to get the commissary that 's coming from headquarters to look after supplies , and God knows what all . There 's times when it seems as if they expected me to fight the whole damned war alone . "   " When are they looked for to come ? " I asked , thinking of Natanis , and in a turmoil inside for fear that something might go wrong to keep me , at this late day , from reaching Mary . " If there 's time I might try the trip myself , with Hobomok , to see what lies before us . " " You ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be here any time  --  in three days , four days  --  a week anyway . " Determined to have some word of Natanis , Hobomok and I filled ourselves with cider and dumplings at Smith 's Tavern , above the shipyard , and set off upstream for Patrick Conkey 's cabin , a matter of ten miles beyond Fort Western . As the canoe leaped through the riffles and skimmed across the pools at the turns my mind slipped back to the day when I had last seen these patches of quick white water and the rolling hills behind the kinks , with their stands of gigantic oaks and pines . On that day , I recalled , Hobomok 's youthful arms had brought down trouble on us , trouble that might have cost us dear in such a trackless wilderness . Yet now the wilderness was dotted with clearings and with cabins , so that the mind was frequently relieved by the gay clank of a cowbell ; and Hobomok 's arms had grown as stout and tireless as a hickory bow , capable of driving us , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his paddle a purchase . By good fortune I found Conkey , ragged , dirty , unkempt , and newly returned from his scouting trip , seated on the ground utside his cabin , comfortably wriggling his bare toes in the afternoon sun and engaged in a spitting contest with his brother ichael and one of his scouting companions . In front of them , removed from the line of spitting , stood a gray stone jug , holding a gallon and more . I gave them good-day and offered them my otter from Colonel Arnold . Patrick Conkey took it , looking t both sides with half-closed eyes and returning it without comment . I asked if there had been changes in recent years on the Dead fiver , at which Conkey opened his eyes a trifle wider and asked ho I might be . I said that I was Steven Nason , as he had readin the letter , whereat he replied dully : " I thought it was a map . " After some meditation he said he had heard of me . He spit refully , protecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lower lip , and his companions followed his example ,  | but without outspitting him . I asked him if he had crossed the Height of Land on this trip . He shook his head slowly , tersely remarking , " Dangerous ! " Then he took a drink from the rum jug , whirling it up onto Ilk right elbow very deftly , after which he exhaled gustily in niv direction , near gagging me with the fumes , and offered me a drink . Not wishing to offend him , I took it , but regretted it the rest of the day ; for an addition had been made to the rum that set up an irritation in my throat , nor could I cough it away , no matter how gently or how hard I coughed . This addition , Conkey said , was fermented corn and ginger . Thinking to jest with him , so that we might be easier in our speech , I asked him whether he had ever tried adding fermented toadstools to his rum ; but when he inquired seriously concerning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might prove dangerous unless blended with exactness . From Conkey 's thick and fragmentary conversation I gathered that he and his companions had carried from the Kennebec to Dead River and there encountered Natanis , who traveled with them for one day but would go no farther with them , though they offered him as much as a dollar a day provided he would continue . Their suspicions were aroused by this refusal of such overpowering riches , and the only explanation that could reach their rum-fuddled brains was that somebody had paid him more money to remain where he was . Since there could be no one but the English who would pay money for any such service , Conkey had accused him of being in the pay of the English . Conkey declared sleepily that Natanis had confessed that this was true , and had threatened to carry word to the English if they attempted to force him to go farther with them . Because of this , he mumbled , they had proceeded a little along Dead River , then returned to the Kennebec and come home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on the tumbling quick water of the river , and inwardly damned this drunken , lying fool until my stomach tightened with rage . I was sure that I knew how it had come about : how Natanis , having received niv message , would not go far from his camp lest I come for his help and find him gone ; and how , when accused of spying for thep265English , he had either joked derisively with them , threatening to perform an impossibility  --  to race on ahead of then and tattle to the English , which would have been of no use to anyone at all  --  or he admitted it , knowing that if he denied it they would have insisted that he accompany them . " If he said he was a spy and would tell on you , " I said to Conkey suddenly , " why did n't you kill him ? We are at war with England . " To this Conkey made no answer at all , but spat repeatedly , striving each time to outspit himself . Then I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that he had run home with his tail between his legs like a frightened cur without bringing a farthing 's worth of information concerning the carries on the Height of Land and beyond it , as he had been told to do , and bearing only a parcel of lies concerning one who might readily be of more value to the army than a thousand Conkeys . I knew that it was no duty of mine to reach over and cram Conkey 's blackened teeth down his throat , much as I longed to do so , since Arnold and the army would require his services , worthless as they were ; and it was clear to me that to argue the innocence of Natanis with him would be as fruitless as discussingreligion with a shoat , since Conkey could not admit the innocence of Natanis without proving himself worthless . To myself I cursed war , not because I objected to fighting in a good cause , but because it permitted the employment of such louts and lunkheads as this Conkey , and gave them a chance forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , to conceal my feelings from Conkey , bespeaking him most courteously and saying that I must be on my way before darkness overtook me . To this he made no reply , except to spit and look at me with dislike in his half-closed eyes , as did his two companions ; and I thought to myself as I went away that there are by far too many such folk in our towns and settlements , and that folk who encounterthem and their descendants can scarce be blamed for attaching qualities of meanness and penuriousness to the people of our province . Uppermost in my mind , as Hobomok and I took to the river again , was the desire to warn Natanis to be on his guard since he was suspected . Yet I could not send Hobomok alone to Dead River , because it is well nigh an impossible journey for one man . Nor could I go with him , since Arnold had told me to await his arrival . Therefore there was nothing for us to do but go back down the river together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; so we pushed on the additional nine miles in darkness , despite our weariness , in order to lie that night at Colburn 's shipyard . It was well , too , I thought , that I had done so ; for as we rounded the point next above Colburn 's shipyard the reflections of a half-dozen fires and two-score blazing pine knots danced in the black water before us , while a great noise of pounding and lumber-dropping reached us from far off. * * *When I could persuade one of the workmen to interrupt his labors long enough to explain this hullabaloo to me he said that word had come up that an armed sloop , the first of Arnold 's vessels , had dropped anchor at Swan Island at dusk . Therefore in the morning the army would arrive , and the bateaux were not half done , so that there was hell to pay and no pitch hot . By eight o'clock the next morning there was a brave crowd assembled on Agry 's Point , on which the shipyard was located : folk from Gardinerstown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river ; old men , very martial and saying how they wished they might be twenty years younger ; young men affecting to regard the occasion as one of no importance , and lurking well in the background ; girls in their finest calicoes , and children screaming and falling in the water ; also a piper and a drummer , together with a fiddler from Hallowell : all waiting eagerly to welcome the army , and all excited , what with the brisk September air , and Master Colburn and the commissary pushing frantically among them in search of folk to sell them additional supplies to eke out the little that they had been able to purchase . My eagerness , in truth , was as great as theirs ; for I was impatient of delay and very wroth at all the vexations I had met , though I could not for the life of me see how Arnold had managed to get his army together and embarked in this short time . At mid-morning a sloop pushed her nose around the point below us , clear in the bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd set up a great shouting and waving , and the fiddle and fife and drum went to playing in a way to set a loon 's teeth on edge . I am no schoolgirl , to burst into hysterics over soldiers going to the war ; but I was moved by the coming of this sloop , and might have been more greatly moved , had it not occurred to me that there were no other sloops behind her , and that there were fewer men on her decks than might have been expected . Staring at her more closely , I seemed to see something familiar about a bulky figure that stood in the bow , eating an apple and waving his hat paternally at the crowded shore . It looked to me like Cap Huff ; and when he turned to his shipmates and bawled an order that must have been heard near as far north as Fort Halifax , I knew that it was indeed Cap Huff . At this I went back where the bank was higher and the bushes thicker , and partly concealed myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not wishing to discommode him by seeming to know him until he showed he wished recognition . Cap swaggered ashore alone when the sloop had made fast to Agry 's dock , and the crowd surged around him , whereupon he made them a speech in his great violent voice . I could not hear all of it ; but from the few words that I caught  --  such words as " people so depraved and barbarous , " " ministers who are scoundrels , " " bloody and insatiable malice "  --  I knew that his eyes were crossed with mental exertion and that he was repeating to them , as near as he could , the words that General Washington had said to us in Cambridge . From the number of open mouths in his audience I feared that his selection was ill suited to their intelligence ; but when he was done they set up a great cheering , and Colburn and Agry the shipbuilder and the commissary from Boston and the fifer and drummer and fiddler and many of the younger women pressed forward to shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashore and , with Colburn and Agry pressinghim close on either side , set off at their head for Smith 's Tavern . When the crowd had dispersed I strolled to the tavern , where I found Cap sitting in a corner with Colburn and Agry , all of them with their heads so close together that a flea could scarce have walked between them . As for Cap 's men , one was sipping buttered rum with an air of excessive solemnity , three had put their heads on the table and gone fast asleep , while three more had slipped to the floor and were lying there in apparent contentment . When Cap saw me he clapped his two companions on the back . " Gentlemen , " he said , " ' spleasure to been some slight service . No use fr'er myself , now going fight bloody and blarbarous bleople , so ' spleasure . " He bowed to them , near losing his balancein doing it , and they hurried out , whereupon Cap came to me and gravely shook me by the hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He cleared his throat searchingly and looked carefully at the lone drinker of buttered rum , who at that moment put his head on the table , joining his three mates in slumber . " Take little walk , " said Cap . We walked inland from the tavern and up the wooded banks , among the gigantic oaks with which the slope was covered . When we reached a brook Cap carefully removed his hunting shirt and lay on the bank , thrusting his head into the water and leaving it there until I began to think he had suddenly died . He came out gasping and blowing ; and after he had repeated the operation several times he joined me where I was sitting among the roots of an oak , folded his hands contentedly across his great hard stomach , and stared blandly up at two fat gray squirrels , busy overhead in a family dispute . " Well , " I said , when he showed no sign of speaking , " what about the sloop ? " " What sloop ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting for a stick or a rock with which to freshen his memory , he contrived to understand me . " If it had n't been for the painting , " he said , " I 'd have been back sooner . " " What painting ? " I asked . " We had to paint her so she would n't be recognized . " Again I fell to hunting for a stick or a rock , until Cap sighed heavily and unbosomed himself of the tale . He and the young men from Pownalborough , he said , those why u had shouted for Jacataqua , had drunk all the rum in their canoe , whereupon Cap , having in his pocket the money that he seized from the Portsmouth tailor , suggested that they go down river and find a place where they could purchase more . Therefore they had set out , very companionable and neighborly , singingp269songs and making merry ; and the night being bright they had come to Parker 's Flats before they knew it and their landed and bought twelve quarts of rum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you buy twelve quarts ? " " I 'm glad you spoke of that , " said Cap . " Ordinarily we would n't have bought but six ; but we talked it over and decided we 'd better have plenty in case of sickness , especially since we could n't tell where we 'd be when we wanted more . " They had intended at this point , Cap said , to return upstream , but there was an argument as to who should paddle , so they stretched themselves in the bottom of the canoe to argue more comfortably . As a result they went to sleep . A considerable time later , according to Cap , he was awakened by bumping into something , and discovered that he had been boat-hooked by an armed British sloop , manned by a lieutenant and seven men , standing into the river under the cover of darkness for the purpose of waylaying commerce to and from Falmouth and Salem . Because of seeming to be more overcome with rum than he was , he was urged to come aboard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was then questioned by the lieutenant , the men gathring around to hear the answers ; so he told them with an air of great stupidity and innocence that there were two swift schooners a few miles up river , their crews fair eating out their hearts because they could find no Britishers to fight . " I told him , " said Cap , " that the whole trouble lay in the way the Americans showered food and drink and money on Britisherswho joined them . Wiry , ' I told him , speaking up so none of the crew would miss it , each Britisher that joins up gets ten dollarsgold , down on the table , and all the rum he can hold with a little more to boot , and chickens to eat as often as he 's hungry ; and some folk regard it as a nuisance , the way our army is so crowded with Britishers that good Americans frequently are n't allowed to join . ' " Not me , though , ' I said . Me , I 'm in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailors , poor souls , most of them snatched from their homes by lousy press gangs and sent to be murdered in their own language , and I drink their healths any ( lay , same as I drink it now . ' With that I handed two bottles to the men and opened one myself , going through the motions of drinking hearty , which they did likewise , sucking at the bottles like a lot of foals going after their ma 's . ' " ' That 's a likely story ! ' said the lieutenant angrily ; and net knowing what he might do or say next , I bawled : Sir , I am not used to having my word doubted ! ' And with no further delay I whopped him as hard as I could under the ribs and shoved him into the water . " Here , ' I said to the crew , pitch me that boat hook so 's I can correct this mistake , ' and with that I jumped into the river and they pitched me the boat hook , letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slung him into the canoe with the two drunks , and took out the rest of the rum and the paddles and gave the canoe a shove down river , after which I swum back to the sloop , where the crew was standing at the rail , looking dazed and finishingup the rum . " This is terrible , ' I said , handing up the rum and bursting into tears while clinging to the bow chains . We have lost the lieutenant and my friends as well ! ' " One of them helped me aboard and gave me a drink of my own rum , asking at the same time if the Americans gave everybodyten dollars gold . " By the time we had finished the rum I had solemnly undertakento see that each one of them received ten dollars in gold , and to keep their desertion a secret , and to use my powerful influenceto get them into the army , in spite of the way in which it 's crowded with Britishers ; also to keep them supplied with rum and food until they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily that the end of the sigh turned into a cough . " That , " he concluded dispiritedly , " is the reason I was away so long , having to run the sloop into a cove and give her a coat of paint and a new name and all , and I du n no as ' t was worth it , smearing ourselves up with paint that way . " He stirred uneasilyagainst the tree trunk , closing his eyes , so that he looked like a great red-faced travesty of a cherub . " I give you warning here and now , " I said , " that I 'll have none of this tomfoolery while you 're with me . I 'll have no rum-guzzlingsot going off half-cocked and getting both of us shot or gaoled or both . " " Stevie , " he said reproachfully , " I 've never been gaoled in my life but ' t was a dirty outrage . You take the last four times " 1 " What 's more , " I said , waving aside his excuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but from the way you act anybody 'd think it was some kind of festival . What are you in the army for , anyway ? " " Hell , Stevie , " said Cap patiently , " ' twas n't safe for me to stay in Portsmouth any longer , the way total strangers were having me put in gaol . Now in the army there ai n't any gaols to speak of . " " And another thing , " I said , " you got to play fair while you 're with me : not go around promising poor , harmless men ten dollars in hard money that you ca n't ever pay them ! " " There you go ! " he said , " accusing me of things I never done , just like they did in Portsmouth ! The last four times I was put in gaol I never " How would you be able to pay anybody seventy dollars , hard money ? " I demanded . " Why , Stevie , " he said gently , " I sold the sloop . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was n't your sloop to sell ! " " Well , I 'd like to know whose it was ! " he demanded . " It was mine as much as anybody 's , and Colburn 'll never buy one cheaper , and the men 'll be paid , and there 'll be a little left over for us to buy something with in Quebec , and that 's not counting the muskets and powder in her . " " Cap , " I said , " there may be something in this ; but I do n't want any of the money . I might use two or three of the muskets , but you 'll have to get rid of the money some other way . " " I 'm not worrying about that , " he said sleepily . " It 'll come to me in the night , some time , just like a flash , how to get rid of the money . And you 're welcome to the muskets . If there ai n't enough for the men we 'll buy more with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' I persisted , not caring to argue the point , and keeping at him because I hoped to appeal to his better nature and so make him a less dangerous companion , " do n't you know you 're doing wrong to promise those men places in the army ? You ca n't get them in the army . Besides , they 're sailors . What can they do ? " " We 're going in bateaux , are n't we ? " he demanded , flopping himself into a more comfortable position . " They can be guides . " P272Saddened by his reckless frivolity , I left him and returned to Colburn 's , where Hobomok was sleeping in the shade of the canoe . Since I wished to send word to Natanis without more delay , we paddled at once to Swan Island , carrying three new muskets with us : one for Hobomok , and the other two for Nata wammet and whoever should go with him to see Natanis . With these , before nightfall , we shot a vast number of ducks ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the south again , millions upon millions of them , flying on every side of us in great wedges and ragged streamers and Iong files , so thick that often it was hard to know , on suddenly seeing a dense swarm of flies , whether one was looking at flies , or at ducks far away ; and equally hard to know , on seeing a distant cloud of ducks , whether it was not a cloud of marsh flies at close range . Jacataqua set the squaws to drying the breasts of most of those we shot , for they are excellent on long marches if other food be scarce . Likewise , I enjoined her to prepare and dry for me the bladders of all the deers that should be killed , so that I might use them in the carrying of food , for I mistrusted the dryness of the bateaux that were to carry our provisions . After we had feasted that night on ducks and pone , very delicious , I instructed Natawammet concerning Natanis : how he should hunt him out and remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a spy , and that he should conceal himself from all white scouts or war parties , lest they kill him first and inquire later into the truth of the tales . Also I ordered that he should be told to draw a true map showing the length of carries between his cabin and the Chaudiere , as well as the route across the Height of Land , leaving this where it might be known that he had prepared it . Hobomok and I went later to Jacataqua 's cabin , so that I was sadly minded of the days when it belonged to Rabomis , and my father had molded bullets beside my bed while Jacataqua , no bigger than a rabbit , had sat in the corner , playing with a doll made from a deer 's thigh bone dressed in buckskin . The camp , further , was quiet , with only a little sound here and a little shout there , unlike the days when there was singing each night , albeit very dolorous and pestilential singing , and dancing and drumbeatingand playing on the jew's-harp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hullabaloo of shouting and laughing andP273howling on every side , very hard on light sleepers , but cheery and amusing . I spoke of this to Jacataqua and she nodded , saying that now there were not enough braves for dancing , ever , and no increase of children to replenish those who departed , what with the throat distemper and the smallpox that the white men so frequently brought to them . Therefore , she said , she thought that she would depart herself , having too Much white blood to be happy with an Indian , and too much Indian blood to be happy in a white settlement . When I said that she might feel differently if she married a good white man she replied that the only white men who married Indian girls were the very good ones or the very bad ones : that all those between were not the marrying sort , and that she had been unable to discover any of the very good ones in any of the Kennebec settlements ; although , for all she knew , there might be one somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these remarks , I made no answer ; though whether this course was the proper one to pursue , I shall never know . All I know is that there are times when the inability to think of a fitting reply is no excuse for not replying . The next morning Hobomok and I accompanied Natawammetand his companion as far as Colburn 's shipyard ; and after Natawammet had set off upstream I offered my services to the commissary from Cambridge in the buying of provisions . The summer had been a dry one , and the water was low in the river ; and as is always the case after a dry summer , the leaves began to turn early , so that we waited for the army amid a wild profusion of colors , gold and russet and dark red and flame red and orange and pink and pale green and dark green , such as I think can be seen nowhere else in all our Eastern country . It may have been that the wealth of colors made the cold weather seem closer to us than the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of impatience to be off ; whatever the reason , we said to ourselves with each passing day that Arnold was never coming ; and we fumed and swore and snapped at each other until we near forgot our hatred of England in our desire to fight among ourselves . I mind that Cap and I , with some of the workers on the bateaux , were at Smith 's Tavern eating a dinner of corned beef ,  | sour because of having been killed in the hot weather , and dump lings very soggy inside , and we were fretful because of the delay and the bad food and the vast number of flies that buzzed about us , walking on our faces and hands , very persistent ; and we wrangled together about the day , which was Friday , the 22d of September , so that the date clings in my mind . Cap said in his great bawling voice , which offended me because of the smell and heat in the dining room , that it would be well if Arnold would not arrive on that ill-omened day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that of all the insane notions , the notion of Friday being unlucky was the craziest . If , I said , it was evil luck for a ship to come to port on a Friday , then it was quite as evil for her to be at sea on a Friday , or lie at her dock ; and if it was bad luck for an army to march on a Friday , it was also bad luck for it to be in existence on that day , for the men must get up and dress themselves and eat and drill , mayhap , and therefore any action would be a forerunner of misfortune . If Arnold , I told him , arrived on a Friday , he must have started on a Wednesday or a Tuesday , or begun to march , even , on a Saturday or Sunday , and perchance planned the expedition on a Monday , so that Friday could have nothing whatever to do with it . Also I declared roundly that only a great noisy oaf , who devoted more time to yapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would speak of any such matter ; and at this Cap looked at the ceiling and wiped his vast hairy hands on his breeches . I knew that he was thinking of going for my throat , and was glad of it , having it in my mind to let him charge past me and then push his thick head through a window so that I could hammer his seat with a stool ; but before he could come at me a boy rushed in at the door shouting that a schooner and two sloops were coming up the stream . With that we ran to the shipyard , all of us , leaping over the long lines of bateaux that covered near an acre of the shore , and saw the reach full of sail , white and gleaming against the glowing leaves that fringed the river . As they drew up to us we could see the decks crowded with men , and among the sloops and schooners a number of birch canoes ; and from all of the craft there rose such a clamor ofP275shouting and laughter that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to storm the gates of London itself , and counted ourselves certain of success , though I thought to myself I would have been better pleased if they had arrived on some other day but Friday.  | To SPEAR with Colonel Arnold on that September afternoon a man needed to he quicker than a flycatcher after a gnat ; for when he was not among the bateaux , peering into them and hefting them , he was racing along the shore , shouting orders to his lieutenant colonels , or telling the master of a light sloop to keep on up the river , or saying who he would see at Colburn 's and who at Fort Western , thinking of a thousand things and doing them all with the rapidity of five men . Down stream I saw the Eunice , but since she was lying off , waiting for the others to get clear , I watched the landing of the three rifle companies from the leading sloops under the direction of Daniel Morgan , an enormous tall man , bigger even than Cap Huff , and so harsh in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking bout , though I learned later that it was his nature to be as gruff and snappish as a wildcat at her food . These riflemen were worth watching , for they came ashore as quick and sure-footed as squirrels : tall men , all of them , dressed in queer jackets of gray canvas made out of sailcloth ; nor were they content to amble along like our New England musketmen , but trotted about their business ; so that while other similar-sized bodies of men might have been pushing each other around trying to find out what to do , they had trotted to their captain , Morgan , who stood out above them like a bull pine standing in second-growth timber , and , with their packs between their feet and their rifles slung at their shoulders , were ready for anything or anybody . I had heard about these men at Cambridge , and I was stirred at seeing them ; for Morgan 's company of riflemen had marched six hundred miles from Winchester in Virginia in three weeks without losing a man . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and able as Morgan 's , and the shooting of all of them was such as to fill our Maine marks/men with amazement , though we are no mean hands with the musket , which is a clumsier and less accurate weapon than the rifle . Young Nathaniel Davis had followed the drill of these Virginiariflemen like a spaniel in Cambridge . He told me that they were trained to load and fire their rifles while running over a broken field , and that while doing this they were able to pierce a target the size of a saucer at a distance of two hundred and fifty paces , which is a very great distance to shoot with a rifle , even when both the marksmen and the mark are motionless . When the Eunice moved inshore I walked down through the piles of packs and the waiting groups of musketmen , thinking to spend an hour with Phoebe before departing for Fort Western , and to send back messages by her to my mother and sister . She was such a pitiful small person , pushing her way among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rope there , that I felt a sense of loss in leaving her and marveled that I was able to do so when I had so despised her at the time I set off with my father to pursue Mary Mallinson . I watched her gallant little figure in all the swaggering foolishnessof sea boots and brass-studded belt and cat 's eyes and blue bandanna , and said to myself that I would give her a kiss to take each one of my sisters as well as my mother , an act of kindness that would give her joy of nights and do me no harm at all . While I watched her , slipping forward and aft like a little child , a waiting musketman caught her around the waist and swung her off her feet ; and so quick that I could scarce see how she did it she caught at a stay with her left hand and whacked the musketman on the head with something in her right , whereat he fell down like a log , and she stepped over him and went on with what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance of childishness . I waved my hand at her , and I could have sworn her eye caught sight of me . Yet she gave no sign , and in a moment she popped into her cabin ; so I fell to looking at those who were disembarking , and among them , to my pleasure , I saw poor Nathanial Lord and Noah Cluff and that limb of the devil , Asa I I utchins . But even while I was shouting at them my eye caught sight of the grace and benevolent face and dignified figure of James Dunn coming over the side . At this I said to myself that I would go aboard and drag Phoebe out of her cabin and stand her up before these friends of hers to hear a lecture that would send her home in tears and keep her so for months to come ; but before I could do it there arose a tall bellowing from the captain of their company , one Captain Goodrich , whereat they all hurried a little way upstream and fell in line . Even so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except that she came out of her own accord and said something to two men who still remained on deck . They at once started to heave up the anchor , and Phoebe leaped ashore and walked by me with her nose in the air , as impudent as any Falmouth baggage . Yet it was not her impudence that held me speechless , gawking at her as a dog gawks at a cat up a tree , but her garb ; for she had laid aside her sea dress and had replaced it with a deerskin jerkin and leggins and moccasins such as Jacataqua wore , except that her head was bound in her blue handkerchief as before , and her cat 's eyes were still at her neck instead of wampum . Before she had gone far past me she put down the bundle she carried and went to fixing her waist , sliding a glance at me as she did so ; and I saw that under her jerkin she still wore her breeches and brass-studded belt , though the leggins and moccasins had replaced her sea boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to her and shook her arm . " You idiot , " I said , and I may have sputtered somewhat in my rage , " what do you think you 're doing ? What do you think this looks like ! " She puckered up her brows at me , seeming to be hurt and puzzled by my anger , though I knew she was neither puzzled nor hurt . " Now what is the matter ? " she asked , peering around at herself , first over one shoulder and then over the other , as women have a way of doing . " Jacataqua made them for me like her own , and we are both of a size . " " Jacataqua ! " I shouted , so near to losing control of my temperthat I could scarce lay my tongue on what I wished to say to her , there being so many things to say and all of a violent nature . " Matter ! Why are n't you on our sloop ? Where do youP279think you 're going ? Why did you let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't shout , " she said . " I am not deaf . " Now if ever I saw a human , man or woman , always able to say the one thing that was the wrong thing , it was this Phoebe Marvin  --  for I could never think of her as belonging to James I ) unn , but only as owning him . " I will shout all I please , " I said , " and if you are not deaf , then I think you are blind and dumb and witless to boot ! " " You will not think so , " she said , " when I tell you the price that I got for the sloop . " " What do you mean , price ? " I asked in a veritable fog of rage and bemuddlement . " Price for what ? " " For the sloop , " said Phoebe . " I sold the sloop to Nathaniel Tracy . " " You could n't , " I said , " because it is not yours to sell ! I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could not be sold . " " I spoke about it to your mother , " she said , " and your mother declared it was a very fine trade for us , so since she owns two Iifehs of it , and I own one fifth , we voted to sell it ; and if you had refused to sell it for the price that we got for it I think that you would have been as great a goose as ever was . " " How much did you get for it ? " I asked . " Four hundred and fifty dollars , " she said . " Twice what we paid ; so that when we get back from Quebec we can have a line brig , or two brigs if we want them , or even a ship . " " We ! " I exclaimed , dropping the matter of the sloop , since the price had indeed been very large . " We ! What sort of talk is this ? How can you go to Quebec when there is no one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough saving our own lives without having you on our hands ! " " It will be a cold day , Steven Nason , " she said , with an air of disdain that made me want to lay her over my knee , " when you find me on your hands . " " Now here ! " I said to her . " This is enough of this ! Either you set off for Arundel , where you belong , or I will go to Colonel Arnold and have you put out of camp at the point of a bayonet ! "  | " That is a very good scheme , " she said , " but I have already spoken with Colonel Arnold , and he said that if my husband had no objections to my following the army he saw no reason why he should raise any ; nor do I recall that you are my husband or have earned the right to speak for him . Furthermore , I am weary of all this twaddle about having women on your hands ; so I will tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife along , a woman three times my size , yet no one is raising a hullabaloo about having her on his hands ; and Warner of the rifle corps is taking his wife as well , and glad to have her . As for James Dunn , I have heard him raising no objections to my going ; nor have I heard any from you , now that I think on it , over the going of Jacataqua . " " She is n't going , is she ? " I asked , taken aback by this news . " Yes , she is , is she ! " said Phoebe , dropping her lower lip vacantly in a manner that she doubtless felt to be an imitation of me , " and a very strange thing , if you ask me , that one who goes around miawling that she is your sister , and hanging to your waist like a sick ninny , should have said nothing to you about it ! " " What do you mean ? " I asked . " Sister , indeed ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough ! It would not be so pleasant for you , would it , if a woman from your home were following this army and seeing you at your innocent play with this brown hussy that calls herself your sister ? Sister ! Pahl " " Phoebe , " I said , " there is no sense in what you say . She was a little girl , playing with her doll at my bedside when I was hurt going after Mary Mallinson ; and how could she be anything but what I tell you , Phoebe , when there has been no room in my mind for anyone but Mary ? " Phoebe shouldered her pack with a sniff . " Then you do not fear what I will see ? " she asked , " and do not mind my being with the army ? " " I do not ! " I said , exasperated with her . " It would make no difference to me if you marched three feet from me all the journey ! " " Then we need say no more about it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Fort Western by canoe I will go with you . " Seeing that she was bound to have the last word , and thatP281nothing was gained by arguing with her , any more than with any ether woman , I set off for the tavern , where I had told Hobomok to await me with the canoe , with Phoebe trailing after me. * * *Already a little order was appearing . The bateaux had been drawn to the edge of the river , filled with packs and supplies . and strings of them were being launched and detachments of men were rowing them upstream . The water was dotted with strings of loaded bateaux , all moving slowly toward Fort Western , and detachment after detachment was setting off afoot along the rutted wood-road leading north from Agry 's Point . On a knoll at the lower end of the shipyard , surrounded by several captains and lieutenants , stood one of the high officers of the expedition supervising the formation of three companies of musketmen . I had barely time to see that he wore a fine blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man standing to one side of and a little behind him  --  a long , sour face of a flat gray color , as though it had been modeled in the clay from one of our Maine coves . It called to my mind the inside of the council house at Swan Island and the cold spring day when my father , dripping wet , dragged himself for the last time up the stairs of our inn at Arundel . I leaped away from Phoebe , raced ; hound the group of officers , and took the gray-faced man by the front of his buckskin hunting shirt . What was in my mind I am not quite sure ; but I know that since I had grown to man 's estate I had often thought , in the half-dreams that lie between sleeping and waking , that I would like to take this man in my hands and pull him slowly to pieces , so that I might be revenged for what he had done to my father . " Is your name Ezekiel Hook ? " I asked this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting shirt . He looked me squarely in the eyes , with no change of color or expression , and shook his head . Before I could question further there came , just behind me , a rasping shout of " Do n't you ever salute officers ? " I whirled around and found myself facing the high officer in the blue coat  --  a very red-faced and angry officer in whom I recognized the same red-faced officer who had bespoken us so harshly in Cambridge for the same fault . He was an older man than any I had seen among the expedition : not a senile man ,  | but a man of forty-five , entitled to respectful consideration , and somewhat ancient , it seemed to me , to be ranging the upper reaches of the Kennebec with winter at hand . " Sir , " I said , saluting very carefully , " I offer you my apologies . I thought this gentleman was one who once did me a grievouswrong . " The red-faced officer , mollified by my respect , laughed up roariously . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Treeworgy would n't ( 1 , , , anyone a wrong . Always doing good , John is . Guide , sir . Knows the Kennebec like a book . Best guide I 've got . " A messenger stood at attention before him , so that he turned away . " Colonel Arnold 's compliments to Colonel Enos , " he said , " and Colonel Arnold asks that he wait here with his division for the construction of twenty more bateaux . " I rejoined Phoebe , dissatisfied with Colonel Enos 's recommendationof John Treeworgy . John Treeworgy looked overmuchlike Ezekiel Hook for my own peace of mind ; and Colonel Enos looked as if he would believe anything , provided it was told to him loud enough and often enough . I could hear Cap 's great bellowing voice bursting out of Smith 's Tavern ; and while I was meditating whether to interrupthim and carry him up with us there was a rush and a scuttle beside me , and Jacataqua pushed herself under my arm while her dog , a big smooth-haired black animal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinned up at me and flapped his tail against my legs , making me think hack to Ranger with a momentary pang of homesickness . " Here , " I said to her , " whatever became of Ezekiel Hook ? " She shook her head . " I do not know him . " " A minister , " I reminded her , " who wanted all of you to be Christians at the time of my first visit . " The name meant nothing to her . " Do you know of a man named John Treeworgy ? " I persisted . " Yes , " she said , wrinkling her nose , as if at a bad odor , and clinging to my waist , " he was an inspector for the Plymouth Company . He carried information about settlers and traders ,  |p283so  that they often had trouble with the company . I have not seen him for three years . Maybe he has been killed by someone on Georgetown Island . " Phoebe touched me on the elbow , nodding toward the tavern door when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burr of New Jersey , the same who had driven me from Salem to Cambridgea short time before , as neat and well brushed as though he had newly come from his tailor . Yet he looked less pretty than I had remembered him , for his shoulders were stooped forward and his eyes were black and glittering , very unpleasant . Beingglad to see him , I saluted him ; but he paid no attention to mc , and I saw that he was staring at Jacataqua . She smiled at him , swinging herself a little forward and backwardat my waist , and said : " We can go now . " " I do not relish your distribution of favors , " said Mr. Burr , paying no attention to her remark . Jacataqua stood away from me , staring at Burr as if frightened , and then at me with a lip that trembled a little . " Sir , " I said to him , " you may remember me . " " Why , " said Burr , turning his eyes toward me for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the circumstances . " " Under-what circumstances ? " I asked . His look was too black and hard for my fancy , though I always found him amiable and good company when his jealousy was notoused . " You know very well , " he said , coming down thevern steps and stepping up to me like a bantam . " I find you too free with your hands . " " Well , now , " I said , " that is too bad , because rather than ofendsuch a helpful gentleman as you have been I shall have to move myself forever from my blood sister . " " Your blood sister ! " said Burr , shooting a quick glance from Phoebe 's face to Jacataqua 's and then to mine . " Why , yes , " I said . " Since she was four years old . " I waited a moment , thinking he would speak , but his hard ack eyes never left mine . " Well , " I said to Phoebe , casting a look at the brassy-bluein which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks a little like n , so we will start . " With that I patted Jacataqua on the shoul-r and took Phoebe by the arm , saying to myself that this r-colored young whippersnapper needed a ducking in the river , and that the only thing that was saving him was the tremblingof Jacataqua 's lip . We started away , whereat Mr. Burr came running to me , very contrite and pretty-looking again , and holding Jacataqua by the hand . " Sir , " he said , " I have behaved very badly ; but dark eyes and cheeks like wine on amber can make the best of men , like the poorest of us , behave like boors . What can I do , sir , to redeem myself ? " " Why , " I said , when I had pondered his words for a time ,  --  you might tell me who Colonel Enos may be ?  --  Burr laughed and shot me what I thought was a grateful glance . " Enos , " he said , as the four of us walked amicably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lousy Connecticut colonels  --  a lieutenant colonel  --  and while he may not think that he is God Almighty himself , he thinks he is a close relative . " " It seemed to me , " I said , " that he has a great passion for being saluted ; and if he is not going to recover from this , there is like to be trouble on the upper Kennebec ; for from what I have seen of our bateaux , they will not stand much dropping on the rocks , even to permit their carriers to salute Colonel Enos . " " He will recover from it , " said Mr. Burr , " when he has something to occupy his mind ; but I fear that he will never recover from remembering that he was an officer of the King in the last long war against the French , and in the expedition against Havana in 1762 , when all the rest of us were infants , puling about the kitchen floor . He is very important with the weight of military lore that he has learned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his age is making him cautious . When Colonel Arnold says Damn everything ! Come ahead ! ' Colonel Enos says Nay : stop and let me think how we did it when I fought with the British ! ' Danin these ancient cautious folk ! say I ; for I can not see how caution will take Quebec . " We went upstream close together , Jacataqua paddling Burr in a light canoe , while her dog sat in the bow , thumping his tail modestly against the bottom ; and Hobomok at the stern of ours . both of us slipping around the long strings of bateaux while those that rowed them bawled pleasantries at us , asking us where the dance was to be , or begging to be invited to the christening , or urging us to stop for a moment so that they mightP285kiss the bride . The whole river was become a highway , with bateaux moving up singly and in strings , and canoes bearing messengersand sightseers shooting among them , with here and there It sloop or a schooner ; and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oaks and pines , with messengers or officers a-horseback weaving through them in both directions . From young Mr. Burr I had a vast store of information concerning the army  --  how it consisted of a few more than one thousand men , all of them men accustomed to the forests or to the fighting of Indians or the handling of bateaux and axes , and in particular to the use of the rifle or the musket . They were , Mr. Burr declared , the choicest spirits of all those troops that lay before Boston , and officered by the bravest men the army afforded ; so that although the number of those who marched to Quebec might be small , their patriotism and determination and ability were very great . At this Phoebe thrust in her oar . " If they are all so patriotic , " e asked , " what ailed those aboard the sloop Eagle in Newbury Port , that they strove so hard to get ashore once they were ard , and had to have guards placed over them to keep them m running home ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puzzlement . ore than one of us has racked his brains over that , " he said . hey went aboard gaily enough , and within two hours it was though the devil had entered into them . One of Arnold 's guidess aboard  --  a sour-faced fellow with a name like a mouthful porridge , but when Arnold questioned him about it he could rn nothing , save that they may have become ill from the stink bilge . " " It takes more than the smell of bilge to give a New Englanderpause , " said Phoebe . " Was the guide 's name Treeworgy ? " I asked . " That was it , " said Burr . " Treeworgy . A name that sounds if its owner was ignorant of the proper way to spell it . " I thought so as well , and said to myself that Master Treergywould bear further inspection . When I asked Master Burr whether he included Colonel Enos ong those who were patriotic , determined , and able , he saidt he did , since Enos had fought the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very dreadfully mismanaged expedition , and so must be counted a brave and able man . But if , he said , there were any shortcomings in him , they were made up by the excellences of Colonel Arnold and Lieutenant - Colonel Greene , the former being regarded by General Washingtonand General Schuyler as the greatest fighting officer in all of the American armies , and the man who would bring the highest military honors to our colonies . Likewise he spoke with high admiration of Major Meigs and Major Bigelow , and of the captains , any one of whom , he said , was fit to be a general ; and in truth I think that with few exceptionshe was right ; for many of them have become generals . Over the rifle companies he waxed well nigh lyrical , saying that they were the greatest soldiers that had ever been seen , and that so far as he was concerned , he would be willing to join in the attack on the great fortress of Quebec with no more than three companies of riflemen and their officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought at the time that he was speaking irrationally , since there are but seventy-five riflemen to a company , I had occasion to change my mind later . At an even later date , when we had picked Johnny Burgoyne 's army to pieces at Saratoga , I heard Burgoyne admit that Morgan 's regiment of riflemen was the finest regiment in the world ; so that I would be the last to say that Master Burr 's judgment was far off the mark . There were horses and oxen at the foot of the quick water leading up to Fort Western and beyond , and the bateaux and supplies were being hauled up on sleds over the spongy wood road ; so Hobomok and I overturned the canoes on one of the bateaux and traveled up in state . When I had set Hobomok to making our canoe into a lean-to , well removed from the tumult that came from within the stockadeof Fort Western , I went to hunt for my friends . The parade ground between the long wooden barracks and the river was already filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and at one of the doors of the barracks stood Cap Huff , idly rummaging among his teeth with a splinter of wood , but casting his gaze around among the newcomers with prodigious attention . Even while I looked he darted past me and seized on a young Rhode Islander who was carrying a pair of dead chickens .   " Got a place to sleep , Brother ? " Cap asked . The boy shook his head . " We got two bunks in the barracks , " said Cap , " but we got to move up the river right away . You 're liable to be here five or six days , Brother , and get rained on if you do n't get a place to ' deep . " The young Rhode Islander stared helplessly around . " Get your friend , " said Cap , " and we 'll trade you our two bunks for your two chickens . " What Cap said about being rained on was true ; but theplatter puzzled me , since Cap was not one to give up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the course of time he emerged torn the barracks , carrying his pack and the two chickens , andcompanied by a very tall , shambling man with a melancholy ace . This man he introduced to me as Lieutenant Church . " The lieutenant , " he said in a rasping whisper , " is the best out in the province of Maine . " The lieutenant said nothing , but looked mournfully at the sickens . " You better get on one of these scouting parties , Stevie , " Cap continued in his hoarse whisper , " or they 'll put you to dragging teaux . Have you dragged one of ' em yet ? " When I said I had not he assured me with a horrified face  --  t one might as well try to drag the Kittery gaol . " I had toN  --  e one of ' em to-day , " he said , pressing gingerly at his vast parse of back with a kneading movement of the fingers that re not occupied with the chickens , " and it kind of took awayappetite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relinquish his bunks the barrack . " Oh , " he said , " they were full of bugs . The lieutenant discovrdthem . " The lieutenant mournfully poked his finger into the breast of . r of the birds . " All right , Lieutenant , " said Cap . " All right ; ii get right at it . " " l low did you get up here so quickly ? " I called after him , they moved away to the upper entrance to the stockade . " I found a horse down at the shipyard , " he explained seriously , I rode it up here to see if I could find out who it belonged " Who ( lid it belong to ? " " Well , " he said , " I have n't had time to ask yet . " * * *We worked until dark that night , getting up supplies from the foot of the quick water ; and later I hunted up Captain Goodrich'scompany to eat with them . They had drawn cornmeal and salt pork and peas , and Phoebe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little enough , God knows . As we sat by our fires and ate our rations I heard amazing tales of what lay ahead of us . There was a mountain that we must cross , one man said , that was alive with the insects known at bed bugs , enormous and very rapacious , more like the hard red crabs on our rocky coast , just at ' low-water mark and beyond , These insects had , for many centuries , bred in this mountain ; and when it was overpopulated great armies of them set out , shrinking in size from their violent exertions in swimming streams and climbing deadfalls , until they came to settlements where they could support themselves . Men who fell asleep near this mountain , the man said , were eaten to death ; and no animal or bird could live on it . Noah Cluff piped up to tell a tale that he had heard about the Chaudiere River , which we must descend . " Chaudiere , " he said , was a French word meaning " boiler , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were round holes down which the water was sucked into the depths of the earth , and as the water went down it became hot and steamed ; and any canoe or boat that so much as touched the edge of the water that was being sucked into one of these holes was drawn down and never seen again . Another said that the army must march across a place called the Height of Land which had never been crossed but by ten men since there were folk to keep records ; and that on this place there were bob-cats the size of moose , and wolverines so fierce that they would attack a man even when they were not hungry , for the pleasure of tearing him to pieces . At each of these tales I laughed , expecting all the others to laugh with me , as they would have laughed if I had said that a sea serpent came up at the mouth of the Arundel River each Sunday morning and devoured two fishermen and a dory ; but1P289they did not laugh , only Asa Hutchins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even at the Bible or a loaded gun . The rest of them grinned , somewhat discomfortably , and looked sidewaysat each other with eyes that showed a little white , and glittered in the firelight . " Well , for God 's sake ! " I said , " and where did you get these bogey tales ! " Jethro Fish poked at the fire with his bayonet and said that he had been crowded off the Eunice and come up from Newburyportin the Eagle , and that all of those aboard the Eagle had heard these tales and many more , some of them worse , like the one about the meadows above the Chaudiere growing on top of rotted heaves , so that those who set foot on them are swallowed up . " Why was it , " I asked Jethro , " that some of the men aboard he Eagle strove to run away when they had embarked contentIlyenough ? " Jethro said that he was not sure ; but that those who strove to go ashore were Connecticut troops , men from towns , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been , he said , that hey were frightened . " Frightened by these tales ? " I asked . At this a great laugh went up , a laugh of derision for folk o would allow themselves to be frightened ; but I remembered rolling of their eyes when the tales were being told , and so t less faith in their laughter than I might have . " Was there any great stench to the Eagle ? " I asked , " of bilge ancient fish ? " " Nay , " said Jethro . " She was a lumber schooner . " I asked him if he had seen the guide Treeworgy , or spoken th him . He said he had not ; nor did the name have a meaning r him . So I turned a little from the matter , conscious that re was something about it that stuck in my gizzard and sat oily on me , and spoke my mind concerning the wild romances y were telling . " Now , " I said , " the truth of it is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arundel know , I traveled the full length of the Kennebee and far up Dead River ; and there I met an Indian , tanis , who had come up the Chaudiere from the St. Lawrence I across the Height of Land . I saw none of these things , nor Natanis . Therefore these tales are fables , such as knaves tell to little children to frighten them when they come to dark places in the road ; and if I knew who had started them I would take off his skin with a rope end , just as I would lash a man who found joy in frightening children . So wipe them out of your mind , and see that there is no repeating of them where you are concerned , lest we have all the Connecticutters and Rhode Islandersrunning away , and our Maine men joining them in a panic and so bringing shame to our province . " A messenger rode into the gate by the lower block house of the stockade and kindled a tin lantern so that he might see the dispatch he carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear : " All men to the carrying up of bateaux and stores at dawn ; all captains to headquarters at Captain Howard 's house , one mile above the fort , at ten o'clock ; all guides to headquarters at sun-up . " Knowing that we had need of what sleep we could get , I went to find Hobomok , and was glad to see that he had made beds for us out of spruce branches . I said to myself , as I pulled the blanket over my face , that now , indeed , we were committed to the enterprise , and there was nothing to stand in our way , so that I could think of Mary as much as I wished ; but before I could start to think I found Hobomok shaking me , and heard the trumpetingof geese overhead , and saw that it was dawn again . P291I HAVE heard times without number , from folk who had no part in our march to Quebec , of the great banquet that was held at Fort Western while we lay there waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pies and watermelons and rum punch ; but these tales have always come to me in after years , when the wood of our bateaux was rotting in the crevices of the river walls . If there was a banquet I saw none of it , nor did those who went with me ; yet when I speak of this I am rebuked by those who tell the tale . They say that I wish to rob our march of its romance . In this there may be some truth ; for there was no romance to it that I could see , not even to that early part of it , but only haste that blistered our hands and toil that blinded us with sweat . There was no work for the guides at Howard 's ; and so we joined the men in getting up bateaux and supplies ; and to this day , despite the lapse of years , I can hear the snarling bellow of Daniel Morgan driving us through the woods with our loads , end see him go charging up past us , dragging at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cursing the curses that he learned as a teamster with Braddock 's army when it marched o its ruin on the Monongahela . T can see the great ledge that blocked the road ; and I mind how Captain Dearborn , he who has since become the Secretary of Ward a general and a great ambassador to some country in Europe , good at the top of it , his shaggy black dog beside him , and ate bottom Captain Thayer , the most deceptive man that ever I w , gentle and mild , yet an ex-officer of Rogers ' Rangers , deadliestt of all bush fighters . As we came laden to the ledge Thayer ould push at us and Dearborn would pull and the shaggy black  --  og would prance and bark , and we would bounce up the ledge s if it were no more than the feather bolster that separates ildren from their parents when all of them sleep in one bed . Above all , I can hear Colonel Arnold shouting at us in a voicep292that was excitement itself , so that it put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up , boys ! Up with it ! No time to lose ! If we lose n day we may lose everything ! Get it up ! Get it up ! " Those that talk of banquets , I know well , have never dragged up more than two hundred bateaux and the supplies to fill them , and made their camp and cooked their meals , and shifted the bateaux to starting places and loaded them , and learned their stations . Yet it may be that I know how these reports of banquetshad their start ; for many of the officers were fed and lodged at Captain Howard 's great house which he had built after he had ceased to be the captain at Fort Western ; and at the end of our day of carrying , just after Colonel Arnold had passed up through us on his way to Captain Howard 's house , Captain Hanchet , a Connecticut officer with an under jaw that stuck far out beyond his upper jaw , came inside the stockade with a lowering face and made a great hullabaloo about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even under the bunks in the barracks . At this Cap Huff , who had come to sit beside me , somewhat moist and breathless , had bawled at Hanchet that there was no use looking in the barracks since the vermin were so thick that within two seconds they would devour a score of pies and the tin plates to boot . From one thing and another I gathered that eight pumpkin pies had been placed in the rear windows of Captain Howard 's house to cool , and that some ill-wisher had made off with them . I would have thought no more about it had not Cap Huff said carelessly that Hobomok had spitted ten partridges and five ducks on a couple of ramrods , and that Phoebe was tending them by my lean-to with James Dunn , and that he had left Lieutenant Church there , and Jacataqua cooking pone , and a friend of Jacataqua'snamed Burr . Dripping at the mouth from the mention of partridges , I made off to the lean-to , followed by Cap ; and when we had got there Cap pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got clown on my knees and peered into it . Resting on the bottom of the bow seat were five pumpkin pies . Knowing that eight had been taken , I asked him where the other three had gone . " Three ! " bawled Cap , popping under the canoe and twisting his great thick head toward the pies . When he came out he wattp293in a rage . " You ca n't trust anyone ! " he growled venomously , staring first at Burr and then at Church , who studied his moccasinsmorosely . " There were six of them there when I left to get Steven . " " What did you do with the other two ? " I asked . Cap made a noise like a porpus blowing on a calm morning . " I dropped one , " he said . " It fell on my foot . The other I had to r:it . " Well , " said Master Burr , " seeing that all of us have got to swear that we know nothing whatever of the things you are talkinabout , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us deal with the others while we still have the chance . Besidesthat , you should feel flattered to think that you are eight times better than any of us . We could make way with only one . " It was plain that this thought was pleasing to Cap , for though he continued to rumble occasionally concerning untrustworthiness , I caught him glancing at Master Burr from time to time with no little admiration . This he did , too , despite the manner n which Jacataqua leaned against Burr while she ate , looking upto his dark , pretty face so sickish-like that Phoebe withdrew tom us and went to sit with James Dunn who , embarrassedthe presence of officers , had perched himself on a log at theedge of the firelight , where he bit into a duck with such a monstrousair of profundity that he seemed to be planning a reform I the currency. * * *It was well that Master Burr had spurred Cap to silence and eater speed , for we had barely finished the last of the pies hen we heard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the path , shouting again for all guides , scouts , d officers to report at headquarters . When we got there we  --  and Colonel Arnold laboring at a desk in Captain Howard 's tting room , checking lists and making new ones and dictating tiers to his secretary and calling for this captain and that capin , and no more interested in a banquet than we were in ving our hair powdered . I was called before him when the night was half done , . and nul Colonel Greene , Colonel Enos , Major Meigs , and Captain organ with him , all of them in fine uniforms save Morgan , ho wore a hunting shirt and leggins and moccasins.  | " Nason , " said Colonel Arnold , popping out his pale eyes at me , " you have been up Dead River . I wish you to give these gentlemen your opinion . " With that he read me Conkey 's report . " Do you think , " he asked me , " that this report is correct or that our army would be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir , " I said , " I think that the report is worthless . I think that Conkey was a coward for not going farther . The report stinks of cowardice and you can find out from Reuben Colburn that the man who made it had to carry six gallons of rum in order to get even as far as he did . " " So ! " said Colonel Arnold , smiling at the others with a look of complete recklessness in his eyes . " I think it is plain that we are safe in taking a shot at it . " " Sir , " I added , " in regard to the Indian Natanis " " I know all I need to know about him , " said Colonel Arnold impatiently . " Sir , " I said , " in this matter the report is also  --  " Colonel Arnold 's face grew dark and lumpy , and he slapped his desk with the flat of his hand , while Colonel Enos frowned portentously at me . " I ask for advice when I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars , as I went out , that I had sent Natawammet to warn Natanis ; and I resolved that I would keep my mouth shut about him in the future until such time as I might be forced to speak . That night we were assigned ; and of the assignments I noted only three : Cap Huff to Lieutenant Church 's scouting party that was to start as soon as possible after sun-up the next day ; John Treeworgy to Lieutenant Colonel Enos ; and Steven Nason to Colonel Arnold . I mind how fat and moist and pleased Cap looked as he set off in the bow of one of Church 's two canoes the next morning , secure in having escaped the danger of being burdened with a bateau , and so red-faced from his recent glut of pumpkin pies that we could almost forget the chill rain that was falling and mistake him for the sun . Likewise , we watched the party of Lieutenant Steele of the Pennsylvania riflemen set off in two more canoes to scout across the Height of Land and bring backp295the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of men who have lived up to their names , I think that this same Steele accomplished it best ; for if ever a man seemed made of metal that would never break , it was he . Often I have seen statues to great men , and on asking what they have done , have found them less deserving by far than Archibald Steele , who will have no statue raised to him , ever . When Steele was out of the way we moved up the bateaux of the first division to the starting place , halfway between Fort Western and Captain Howard 's . The three companies of riflemenformed the first division , and all of them agreed to go tinder the leadership of Morgan , though our New Englanders , who were badly disciplined and more independent than a sow with a litter of pigs , would have been less willing to march under him because of the manner in which he issued strict orders and enforced them with a heavy hand . Yet the riflemen , being highly disciplined , took pride in him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have followed him through hell and high water , even while calling him most opprobrious names : Old Yeller-belly and Dirty Dan and Gorgon Morgan and others too foul to set down . Indeed , they held Morgan in almost as high esteem as Arnold , who was considered by all the troops to be the . ravest and ablest officer , not only of our little army , but of thetire continental forces . Now that I look back on it , I doubt that our march could have en made under any other officer but Arnold , excepting Washgtonhimself , because of the fearful jealousies that would ve arisen . Arnold was a dare-devil , very violent and passionate hen he had cause , or considered that he had cause . So , too , s Morgan , though far ruder and coarser than Arnold , who d the manners of a very polished gentleman when he chose use them . Because of Colonel Greene 's high rank , Arnold had planned place him in command of the first division ; and this he anuncedon Sunday , while we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great outcry from Morgan , an outcry that many f us heard because of his booming teamster 's voice . He would knowledge , he said , the authority of no man except Arnold er his riflemen , nor would the riflemen acknowledge it , and erefore he would command the riflemen or nobody would command them . At this I looked to hear an explosion from Colonel Arnold , but there was none . He soothed Morgan and he soothed Greene , saying that Morgan had a genius for leading quick-moving troops in forests , and that his experience was greater than that of any man 's . Since , he added simply , the object of the attack was to capture Quebec , and not to gain glory for any individual , he would yield to Morgan 's judgmentgive Colonel Greene the command of the second division . Thereuponthere was great good feeling , Arnold and Greene being happy because they had been generous , and Morgan being happy because his claims , which were justified , had been immediatelyrecognized. * * *On a Monday , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the starting place and watched Morgan 's tall Virginians launch their sixteen bateaux , laden with forty-five days ' provisions and their ammunition and axes , but with little else , since they must needs travel light and hew out a road across the Great Carrying Place for the rest of us . Each bateau was poled by two men , while a relief of two men followed it along the shore ; and when the first bateau of the sixteen was a black clot in the swift water upstream , the sixteen bateaux of Smith 's Pennsylvania riflemen went in , riding high in the water , and set off after them ; and behind them the sixteen bateaux of Hendricks ' Pennsylvania riflemen , all the bateau. men poling for dear life , and those who marched on shore shoutingat them very profanely to be about their business . and not to let the lousy Virginians beat them , and to be careful not to run on a rock , dearie . Among those who shouted was the wife of Sergeant Grier , an estimable woman with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a draught horse , and Mrs. Warner , a tall red-faced wench ; and as they struck out ahead of their husbands , Sergeant Grier reached out and slapped his wife affectionately on her broad scat with the butt of his rifle , so that she went howling into the woods . In three minutes there was no sign of the more than two hundred men save the bateaux bobbing upstream , yawing in the swift water , and the faint shouts of those who had been swallowed up in the crimson foliage of the river side.  |p297While  still the shouts came drifting clown to us , Arnold was at us to help the second division with its bateaux and supplies ; and by noon of the next day the second division went up , CaptainThayer 's company and Captain Topham 's company and Captain Hubbard 's company , the bateaux streaming out into the river under the eye of Colonel Greene and Major Bigelow , very fine and brave officers , and more than half the men marching along the shore , strung out and making no effort to march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road was a trail , churned into soft loam by the passage of many feet and the rain of Sunday . With this division went young Master Burr , his rank being that of volunteer cadet officer ; and he came up behind me , very upper and smiling and hampered by no pack at all , and said to me , " Bring up a pumpkin pie when you come . " I asked where Jacataqua was , whereat he winked mysteriously , saying that she would be along shortly ; and so she was , soon as the tumult had died away , paddling bow while onef her young Swan Island braves knelt in the stern , her yellowceddog leaning heavily against the small of her back , yawning ron time to time as though he foresaw little to interest him in c outlook : Knowing that Phoebe would be off on the morrow , I traveled  --  the Fort to see her that night , and found her cutting James urn 's hair , while he sat brooding philanthropically on a log , as  --  ugh he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not decide Nether or no to be president . Phoebe gave him a few extra snips around the ears at my approach , then handed him the scissors , tting him on the shoulder as one pats a child , and said kindly : ' ake these back to Jethro , James , while Mother talks to Stevie . " " For God 's sake , " I said to her , when he had padded away , o back to Arundel and take him with you . You 're like two children , not knowing what lies ahead of you . " She shook her head . " Yesterday I thought I might , " she said . here were some men deserted from Enos 's companies , and no ort made to bring them back , so I thought I might take James away with me . " " Well , " I said , " why did n't you ? " She smiled wryly and twirled her string of cat 's eyes . " When told him about it , " she said , " he looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't do that , ' he said , because sonic body might think I was afeared . ' Then he told me he was having a good time : the best time he ever had . " She swung her cat 's eyes thoughtfully . " He never had a good time , Stevie , " she said . " He was always put on ; always pecked at ; always browbeat when there was any browbeating afoot , more than anybody else ; always a little laughed at in the shipyard and the tavern . Now he is n't pecked at any more than anyone else ; never will be again , he says , because he can always do what they tell him to do . Nothing to do , he says , but carry a pack and a musket and go where you 're told . He can do that as well as anyone , he says . " " Is n't he afeared ? " I asked . " He says not , " she told me . " He says there 's nothing to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what you 're told . " There was something in that , I decided . I knew that in my own case I sweated and groaned in my blanket when I thought , as I often did , that I plight be kept from finding Mary by these endlessdays of delays , or by falling over a rock and breaking my leg . " Why did you marry him , Phoebe ? " I asked her ; for it was a question that often came into my mind . She held up one of her cat 's eyes and squinted at the fire through it . " I 'll tell you some day , " she said , and she must have sensed the thought that had been passing through my head . " I 'll tell you after you 've found Mary . " " I hope to God it 'll be soon then , " I said , and Phoebe continued to gaze at the fire through her cat 's eye , turning it to the left and to the right , as though to catch the glow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " there have been desertions among Enos 's men ? " She nodded . " They say there 's a thousand Iroquois ambushed on the Chaudiere , waiting for us . " " They say ! They say ! " I shouted . " It 's a lousy lie ! How would the Iroquois get down through Schuyler 's army , and who 'd feed them ? Why is it that none of the other divisions gets these stories , only Enos 's ? " I got up in a rage , with a vague idea in my mind , and started off to put it to use . " Well , " said Phoebe , " good-bye in case we get separated from you . "  |p299I  went back and took her by the shoulders , for I had seen a deal of her in the past four years , and she seemed like a young brother , a little . " We 'll see each other often , " I said . " Do n't go to falling into any logans , and keep your feet out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone was listening . " If anythinggoes wrong after you reach the Height of Land , " I added , " you can always find friends of mine in the woods . Understand ? Red friends . Send Jacataqua , and keep it to yourself . " She stared up at me with a sort of trusting look in her eyes , so I stooped down and kissed her . Her lips were cold , and she did n't shut her eyes . " In the spring , " I said , " we 'll have our brig . " She nodded . " Good-bye , Phoebe , " I said . She did n't answer ; so I went away to look for Treeworgy . I found him sitting by a fire , gray-faced and sour-mouthed , as if he had been eating half-ripe chokecheeries ; and if he was not Ezekiel Hook he was the spit of him , except for being somewhatheavier and somewhat grayer . There were a few young musketmen at the fire with him , all very somber and cheerless. 1 dropped my hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned and looked up at me , then grinned sourly . " Not me , " he said , seeming to take no offense . " What 's all this I hear about desertions ? " I asked . Treeworgy humped his shoulders . " There 's a few went home , " e said . " One or two , mebbe . Homesick , likely . Got to thinking , the way boys will , that they would n't see their mas or their gals for months or years , mebbe ; mebbe ever . " One or two of the young musketmen near him moved uncomfortably , staring into the fire . " There 's something queer going on in this division , " I said . " There 's more damned lies circulating around in it than Beelzebubhimself could think up in a million years of hell . " Treeworgy nodded . " I heard ' em , " he said . " Them about the British mining the banks of the St. Lawrence , so 's to blow us all up , and Million Rattlesnake Mountain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Water Bog , that p on fall into and cook if you try to cross . " " My God , Treeworgy ! " I shouted , " have n't you got any more ' tense than to repeat these things ? They 're damned filthy lies , fit1 to scare the gizzard out of folks that do n't know Dead River is as pretty a river as there is . " " That 's what I tell ' ern , " said Treeworgy sadly . " When they come to me and ask if Dead River got its name from the thousandsthat died on it I tell ' em it ai n't so ; and the same with all of the stories . I do n't believe any of ' em . " " You do n't believe them , " I said , breaking out with a flux of profanity and watching him carefully while I cursed . " You know there is n't a word of truth in them . " " Well , now , I guess that 's right , " said Treeworgy , as mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and seeming to pay no attention to my swearing . " You know it 's right , " I said , " and if I can get my fingers on the misbegotten spawn of hell that started them I 'll tear his lying windpipe out of his throat . " And with that , having in mind how Ezekiel Hook had shrunk before what he had been pleased to call my father 's blasphemy , I blasphemed against the teller of these tales with such violence that I was shamed by my own playacting . Yet the gray sourness of Treeworgy 's face altered not a whit at my words , so that I was forced to believe that he told the truth when he said he was not Hook . On the next day , Wednesday , the third division went on its way , Captain Dearborn 's company , Captain Ward 's company , Captain Hanchet 's company , and Captain Goodrich 's company , all of them led by Major Meigs , whose first name was Return , so that he was scurrilously known as Back-tip by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the other divisions to shout , " Whoa ! Whoa ! " at them . His own men , indeed , were given to shouting , " Whoa ! Whoa ! " at each other ; and immediatelyon doing so they would pole their bateaux very vigorously , being in large part men from Maine and Northern New England , very skillful with setting poles , so that they would readily forge ahead of all others in sight . The river looked to be filled with the bateaux of this division , sixty-four of them , and each one of them loaded more heavily than Morgan 's or Greene 's ; for the way had been prepared by the first two divisions , which must needs travel lighter and more easily through the uncharted and untrodden country . My heart misgave me as I watched James Dunn and Phoebe marching off abreast of the bateau that was poled by Jethro Fish and Asap301Hutchins , Asa bawling , " Whoa ! Whoa ! " at the top of his lungs ; for Phoebe seemed very small , marching thin and straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James , an extra pair of small moccasins dangling at her waist . She turned and waved to me , then vanished under the flaming leaves of a giant maple ; and I wondered what in God 's name I could say to my mother if I had to come home without her . And so we turned to the getting up of Colonel Enos 's division , the fourth and last , heaviest laden of them all , since the carrying places would be cleared for them , and huts built , and camping places selected . All that day we worked like slaves , and the next morning , bringing bateaux and tents and kegs of nails and pitch ; barrels of bread and pork and peas ; bags of flints and salt and meal , and a whole kit and boiling of material . But still there were bateaux unfinished and supplies unassembled ; and Enos was puttering about at Colburn 's like an old woman or a British general . Thursday passed , with Arnold sending messenger after messengerto Enos , his face black and lumpy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gnawing at his nails until they were chewed straight across the ends of his fingers . Yet he was pleasant enough to the rest of us , holding his turmoil within himself , so that when he told me to go down and tell them for God 's sake to hurry , he said it pleasantly and calmly , with only a little twitching at the corners of his mouth to show his eagerness to be off . Even on the next morning , a damnable Friday again , though I have no sympathy with folk who attach an evil influence to this day , there were only two of Enos 's companies up  --  Captain McCobb'sand Captain Scott 's  --  while Enos and the commissary and Captain Williams 's company and Reuben Colburn 's company of carpenters were still down at the shipyard gathering up their odds and ends . At ten o'clock Arnold 's adjutant , Captain Oswald , came jumping down the path from Captain Howard 's house and ordered McCobb and Scott to send off their companies . " Let Enos and the rest follow when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned to me , grinning like a small boy who has heard good news . " Get your canoe , " he said . " We 're leaving for Quebec in an hour . " Hobomok brought me up to Howard 's with our packs , and with our meal tied into bladders , so that no water could hurt it , and over our packs a bearskin that he had got from Swan Island . Arnold 's long canoe was there , loaded , with an Indian in the bow and stern and places for Arnold and Oswald . I did not know the Indians , so asked Hobomok who they might be . " Eneas and Sabatis , " said Hobomok . I only half heard him , for Arnold came plunging down the bank , a yellow hunting shirt over his uniform . There was little of the colonel about him , for he turned a cartwheel on one hand as he came up to us . " Keep close behind , " he called to me . " I 'm using you to carry dispatches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeming to bounce across the quick water toward the converging walls of red maples as though shooting into a funnel of flame.  | To MY mind there is a peculiar beauty to the Kennebec : dappledwith ledges and islands ; twining gracefully among its rolling meadows and its towering forests and its rock strewn mountains ; slipping smoothly across levels ; plunging headlong over falls ; coiling quietly in pools . There is something about it , I have often thought , that captivates those who gaze upon it : something that brings them back to stare at it in fascination ; to dare its perils ; to listen at night to the dry rustlings , the chucklings , the intermittentrattlings with which it flows along its rocky bed . Sturgeons and salmons return to it each year in greater numbers than to any of our other rivers ; and even wild fowl , struggle as they may to leave its glittering folds , seem drawn to it from distant places , too often falling victims to their infatuation . Yet one must have a care ; for there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fall and winter this becomes a bite that tortures flesh and sinks into the bone . Being busy with my thoughts and my muscles as we went up the stream , I could neither see the beauty of the river nor feel the chill of waning September . I had become conscious of the names of Arnold 's Indians , and it had come to me that they were the Abenakis of whom we had learned from Natanis : the ones who , punctured by my father 's arrows , had been left by Guerlac at the Chain of Ponds when he was running for safety ahead of us . How this coincidence had befallen was the thing that puzzled me ; for Hobomok declared that Sabatis and Eneas lived far removed from each other , Eneas near the Height of Land still , but Sabatis in the settlement called Pittston , close to Colburn 's , for whom he trapped beavers and otters and so lived in comfort . In truth , my brain was in a muddle over the affair . I misliked the thought of revealing myself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioned them as I would like to do ; for if it was known to them that I had been a party to the attack on them when they had been Guerlac 's men , their love of vengeance might lead them to  | do me a hurt , or to include my friends in their hatreds  --  Natanis or Cap Huff or Phoebe or Hobomok ; for God knows what an Indian will do when he considers that he has been wronged . So I said to Hobomok that we would bide our time until we had found Natanis , who would either know the truth or discover it for us . No sooner had we finished our talk on the matter than Colonel Arnold signaled us to go ashore at the settlement called Vassalborough ; and when we had done so , he climbed out of the canoe with water dripping from the seat of his breeches and inquired of me in scathing tones what would have become of the army if it had used canoes . " This thing is a basket , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad for those who sit in it . Let me have no more of these bark cockleshells , and get me something that will keep out the water . " I said that the canoes I had advocated were the large freight canoes , thirty feet long and more , and not the small passenger canoes like his and my own ; though they , I insisted , were dry enough for anyone provided their seams were well-pitched and tight . But he would have none of our canoe when I offered it , though it was as dry as a puff-ball ; so Captain Oswald and I hunted through the settlement until we found a high-sided wooden canoe such as is called a peraqua or pirogue , carved exceedingly thin out of a very great pine log without knots , a log that must have been near five feet in diameter when it was standing . In this , after it was loaded , the colonel went on , albeit more slowly . We passed up through the bateaux of the fourth division before dusk and encamped that night a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , together with that of all the other Kennebec forts , had vanished when James Wolfe took Quebec from the French . By mid-morning of the next day we had passed the fort and found many bateaux waiting at the first carrying place , though the most of then had already been carried the third of a mile around Ticonic Falls . Here there was a tumult , for the water was very quick and broken , so that the men were in and out of it perpetually , holding their bateaux in place and nursing them into line , slipping on the rounded stones and filling their mouths in the middle of a curse , and coughing and swearing and shouting at one another.  |p307I  thanked God that I was handling a canoe , for each bateau must be unloaded , piece by piece , and the load placed on the bank , after which the bateau was pushed out of the stream and balanced on two carrying poles , whereupon the four men of its crew staggeredoff up the path with it , slipping in the mud and stumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire third of a mile , following which they returned and shouldered the load , kegs and barrels and sacks and tents and muskets , carrying them the third of a mile to the bateau and stowing them in place and setting off into the stream again . Yet Ticonic Falls was nothing so far as labor was concerned , to the Five-Mile Ripples , which lay just above Ticonic Falls . These come down at such a slant , and with such a turbulence of foam and waves and leaping spray , that one who has never passed over them will say , on looking at them , that they can not be mounted in any craft whatever . Knowing that they must be conquered , the bateaumen belittled the prospect , one declaring that fish went up it , and that no fish was better than he was , and another asking loudly whether the current was running up or down , or standing still , and others shouting , " Whoa ! Whoa ! " and all plunging at it without delay , each bateau carrying four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poles , shoving as rapidly and violently as might be ; and when the head of the bateau began to fall away with the swiftness of the water the other two would leap over the side and struggle to hold her bow upstream . Often they could not do this , so that the bateau would whirl downstream , near drowningthe two men in the water , and bring up with a crack against a half-submerged rock . Thereupon they would straighten her out and go at it again . Oftentimes a bateau would get entirely out of control and be swept back again and again , losing all the distance gained in hard half hours of labor ; and other bateau crews would go past them shouting , " Heave up your anchor ! " or " There ai n't nothing downstream ; we been down there ! " or " What you waiting for ? I I igh tide ? " There were five miles of these ripples , very long miles ; and though all the bateaux got up eventually , there was never a one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a power of wrenching from the current , so that well-nigh all of them had sprung a leak  --  not one leak , either , but many of them , bow , stern , sides , and bottom . Some of the bateaumen stood calf-deep in water when they had surmounted the ripples ; and if there was a dry load among them I heard nothing of it . The dusk came down bitter , with a white mist rising from the river , a mist that seemed to stiffen the arms and legs in their sockets ; and when we saw a line of fires we went ashore . The fires belonged to Meigs and his men ; and we found them inclined to be thoughtful and silent ; for the result of all their labors , which had near burst the muscles of their arms , and the racking and buffeting they had received from the torrents they had breasted and the slimy boulders over which they had clambered , was a gain of seven miles between dawn and dark . We unpacked a tent for Arnold and spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night , I mind , that the coughing started ; and there was never a night after that , for months , that the sounds of the river or the forest came to me free of coughs . We fell asleep to a chorus of coughs , and we woke to more coughs . There was no end to the coughing , so that it seemed to us there could be no place in the world that was free from it . A barrel of salted beef had been broke open that night , but when we came to eat it , it was summer-killed and sour ; so that there was great argument among the men , some saying it was beef , but others declaring that it was horse or porpus , or maybe seal ; and most of them pitching the meat into the river without more ado . I found Captain Goodrich 's company a little way below us , with Phoebe tending James Dunn , who sat very regally before a large hot fire , occasionally shaking with a chill that collapsed him like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Asa and Noah and poor Nathanial Lord , and even Phoebe ; and the night was one of those cruel nights that sometimes strikes at the end of September , a night when the water freezes along the edges of brooks and puddles , and the unaccustomed coldness seems to bite deeper into the marrow than the real cold of later winter . " Nobody got wet to-day , did they ? " Asa asked me , with pretendedanxiety . I told them to stuff their pulpy shoes and moccasins with leaves , tight , if they wanted to get another week 's use out of them . " How is it up ahead here ? " asked Noah , careless-like , as though it mattered not at all ..  |p309I  could feel the others waiting for my answer , and I regretted that I had come . " Well , " I said at length , " it ai n't so good , but it might be worse . " They pondered over this for a time . " Well , " said Phoebe at length , " to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come through a tidal wave . " " What I think we ought to do , " said Asa , turning to Jethro Fish , " is to bore holes in the bottom of our bateau , so 's the water can run out as well as in . " A man bawled at us from the adjoining fire . " We got a better scheme over here , " he said . " We 're going to cut big holes in the bow and stern . Then we can stand in the holes and walk along the bottom and hold the bateau up around us like it was our skirts . " " How 's James doing ? " I asked Phoebe . " If it ai n't any worse than to-day , " said James , " I can keep going forever . " " It looks as if that 's about the length of time you 'll have to keep going , " Noah Cluff told him sourly . Seeing that they were in good spirits in spite of their wet clothes and bad food , I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desertions , which had begun to be noticed toward the end of the Five-Mile Ripples . One bateau crew from Meigs 's division , he said , had deserted in a body , vanishing into the forests with their muskets . " What does Arnold say about it ? " I asked . " He says we 're better off without them , " said Oswald . " He says they would n't fight anyway . " " That 's about right , is n't it ? " I asked . " Maybe , " he said , " but it gets worse farther on , they tell me . " " You have n't seen anything yet , " I assured him . " What if they all quit , then ? " he suggested . " The way you and the colonel are going to quit ? " I asked . " My God ! " he said , " there 's nothing that 'll make us quit . " " No , " I said , " and there 's several more that feel the same way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " I guess it was thatsalted beef that got me so gloomy . " That was a bad night ; for the wet clothes froze on the men , a very distressful feeling ; and no man was wishful to lie abed beyond dawn . Yet bad as the day before had been , this first day of October was worse , and so was the day that followed it , evenp310though we were still in the settled regions of the river , and not yet swallowed up in the wilderness . On the first day we went up through fairish water , quick but nothing that the bateaux could not pass with the help of a few men in the water , though they were strengthened none by the passing , and shipped water fast , so that the men were ever drawingup to the shore and bailing with bark scoops . But in time we approached Skowhegan Falls , made by the devil for the torturing of racked bateaux . Half a mile below the falls there was a right angle in the river and below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water was shot around the bend from the narrow channel above it . Here the bateaux were strained and slammed against the rocks , and how they came through the whirlpool and the narrow chute I can not tell to this day , though I watched them passing through , the bateaumen swinging their poles from one side to the other like flails , poking and clawing and scrambling like cats and taking no time to hurl pleasantries at each other in their usual way . Yet above the chute between the ledges there was a half-mile run of hellish current , quick and white and shoal ; and though the reliefs were able to scramble along the shore , dragging at the bateaux by ropes , they were ever bumping and thumping against the rocky banks and sopping up water like so many salt bags . And finally , at the end of the half-mile run , there were the high Skowhegan Falls on each side of a craggy island in midstream . The face of the island was near six times the height of a man ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Abenakis say was made by the tomahawk of the great lord Glooskap . The cleft was the route for the carrying of canoes over the falls ; and a worse carry I have never seen for even the lightest of these light craft . One man must drag , clinging with his toes and knees and finger nails to the rock ; and another man must push , pressing himself against the rock sides like a snail ; and if either of them slip , then both of them are cruelly scraped and bruised , fortunate indeed if they be not hurled to the bottom of the cleft and all the skin torn from their bodies and legs and faces , and their canoe smashed into the bargain . When , therefore , the bateaumen went to carrying their bateaux up through this cleft , after the barrels and packs and stores had been unloaded from them , there were times when it seemed that men would have to burst like eggs between the bateaux and thep311rocks , and other times when it seemed that a bateau could not move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with axes . Yet every bateau went up , though I saw many men lying exhausted on the point of the island above the carry with a shouldertorn out of their hunting shirts or a knee gone from their breeches , and the edges of the holes stained with crimson where the rocks had gnawed the flesh , or with rags tied around their hands and fingers , where they had been crushed between the bateauxand the ledges . Everywhere , on both sides of the river and on the islands , the men were calking their bateaux as best they could ; for being of green wood , and not too well made , they had opened up under the pounding and wrenching as though they were built out of pieces of driftwood ; and I thought it was true , what Phoebe had said to me , that she would as lief essay this journey in the ancient skiff in which she had learned to sail as a child , made out of a sunken boat patched with pitch and rotten canvas , as in one of these terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nails , ordered me forward to catch the head of the army , so that everyone might he stopped at Norridgewock for the calking and repairing of bateaux ; and indeed , if he had not done so , there would have been some that would have burst into an armful of sticks in midstream and gone floating off beyond recovery . So Hobomok and I went up past Greene 's men , struggling through the roaring water of Bombazee Rips ; and by nightfall we had passed the point of land that my father and I had known a . Norridgewock , but that now was nothing , its cabins having been leveled to make place for the farms of two settlers . We came up to Morgan at the foot of Norridgewock Falls , where the riflemen were unloading their bateaux and preparing for the carry around . Morgan was in a rage over the bateaux . He was a strange figure , having grown a bristly beard and being clad in nothing but leggins , moccasins , and a belt cloth , in the Indian fashion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whipping that he had had from British officers in his younger days  --  a whipping that caused him to hate the British with a bitter hatred , and that cost them dear before Daniel Morgan had done with them . " By God ! " said he , roaring so that he could be heard near to Widow Warren 's , halfway back to Skowhegan , " it 's high time Look at this ! " With that he seized one of his bateaux by the thwart and heaved it onto its side , so that its load of barrels and tents and bags and litter of tackle slid out in a dripping heap . Then he banged the side with his great fist , sinking one of the boards below the other , slipped his fingers into the opening he had made , and with a jerk of his arms loosened the upper part of the side from the lower part as easily , seemingly , as the backbone of a broiled mackerel is lifted from the meat . " A puking baby could build better boats out of blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place with two mighty ' blows of his fist . " Show me the perfumed dressmaker that basted them together for men to risk their lives in , and I 'll calk a boat with his skin ! " Thereupon he named the carpenters the most violent names that ever I had heard , foul names that he brought up from dark recesses of his mind , so that I was filled with amazementto know that there was so much profanity that had been hidden from me . I think in truth he would have done as he said ; and since I had no doubt that Colburn had built to the best of his ability with the material at hand , I was glad that he and his carpenters were far behind , with Colonel Enos . Nor were the riflemen milder in their anger than Morgan , for their supplies were soaked and they themselves had been drenched by day and frozen by night since they had left Fort Western seven days before , so that illnesses were breaking out among them , very violent dysenteries and throat distempers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me in all seriousness that they thought of waiting until the carpenters should come up , and then binding them and carrying them to the top of the falls and sending then ) over it in the worst of their bateaux . " Nay , " I said , " the fault lies farther back than that ; and the one to blame is the man who persuaded General Washington and Colonel Arnold that this river could be navigated in bateaux . " " And who is that , " asked a tall Virginian , whose wrists were so swollen with rheumatism that he held his hands before him as if he sought our approbation for them . " I do not know , " I said , " but in time I shall find out . " " When you do , " he said , " we 'll skin him for you , unless you'dsP313rather have him covered with clay and baked in a hole in the ground . " Yet these men would not rest , saying that they must cut the reads for the others because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Connecticut and ; Maine , which I think they were , though our Maine woodsmenare by no means entirely useless ; so at dawn the next day a part of them began to carry their baggage up the great rocky hill which is the Norridgewock carry  --  a hill a mile in length , and as rough and cruel as the ledges of our Maine coast , while the rest of them went to calking and nailing and pitching their bateaux . As soon as a bateau was finished four men would hoist it to their shoulders and stumble off up the carry ; so that by the time Arnold reached us that night the entire first division had gone over . The other divisions came up slowly , , in worse condition , I thought , than the first ; for they were more heavily laden , and the men were less powerful , man for man , than the riflemen , so that their bateaux had been less skillfully handled and had received a worse buffeting . Never did I see a greater mess than many of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stuffed loosely around the casks and barrels . These , from being soaked in water for some days , had disintegrated ; and the water had gone into the barrels containing dry bread , so that the bread had swollen and burst the barrels . Likewise , there were casks of dried peas ; and here had been poorly coopered . Thus the peas also had swollen and forced the staves apart ; and the bottoms of the bateaux were lied with a loathsome soup of fish and bread and peas , trampled ogether and smeared over the rest of the baggage . Now Norridgewock was less than a third of the distance that e must travel in order to reach Quebec ; and beyond Norridgeock , until we should come to the French settlements far down e Chaudiere , there was no house and no road , only unbroken rests to which axes had never been laid since the beginning ofe world . Therefore I misliked this wrecking of our food supply ; r it left us with nothing except flour and pork , and not too muchf that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any of our soldiers to be sparing with their rations , nor did I look to see them so while there was any left ; for their independence was such that if they were told to eat less food they would eat more out of cus sedness . Yet Colonel Arnold was in no despair over the mischance o f the provisions , nor did I ever see him in an evil mood so long as he could go forward . At a delay he was in a frenzy of anxiety and querulousness ; but while he could move toward his goal there seemed to he no blow so great that it could lower his spirits . " Now , " he said to me , when I reported to him the bursting of all but two of the bread barrels in the third division , " now they will travel faster ; for they will travel lighter and be more eager to come to a place where food may be had . " Nor could I quarrel with his determination to press on , for I had long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quebec to hunt for Mary Mallinson , even though every man in our army turned back and left me to go alone . Knowing what I knew about our food , I would have sent Phoebe back ; but when I went down the stream and sought her out I found her perched beside James Dunn in the warmth of a roaring fire , like a half-drowned mouse sitting beside a sleepy dog . She was roasting strips of pork on the end of a stick , wrapping them in cakes made of flour and water , and pushing them into James 's mouth . There was mud on her face and on the blue handkerchiefaround her head , and a welt across her throat where a briar had slashed her . From her breast to her moccasins she was black with water and mud and leaf mold , and her extra moccasins had been removed from her waist and fastened at her neck , where they hung under her ears like two pendulous lobes . " Where are your cat 's eyes ? " I asked her . Having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popped it hurriedly into her mouth and went on feeding James , pausing only long enough to show me a lump tied into the toe of one of her extra moccasins . " Phoebe , " I said , " take James and go on back home . The food 's going to run short ; and there 's no houses beyond here . " James Dunn removed a half-chewed piece of salt pork from his mouth and regarded me with a dreadful calm . " When are you leaving ? " he asked . " That 's my James ! " said Phoebe thickly , her mouth being full of pork.  | " Why , " I said , surprised at this unexpected burst from the silent James , " I 'm not leaving , but I do n't want to see you two get into trouble . " " Of course you do n't , Steven , " said Phoebe , her mouth being normal again . " None of us would have dreamed of coming with this army if we 'd known there was going to be any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said James . " We would n't know what to do if we could n't be in trouble , " said Phoebe . " You know what I mean , " I said . " From the way you talk about us going back , " said James , " youmust think we 're a couple of rats from the Fourth Division . " " No , " I said , taken aback by James 's newly found independenceand willingness to use his tongue . " No , no ! No , no , no ! " " I 've got the flux , " said James , " and my stomach has ached me for two days , but even so I can march better than most of thesesoldiers . There ai n't none of them passed me . I 'm as good as anyof ' em ; and there ai n't any of them that 'll do any better than I do , not while I 'm alive . " " Good ! " I said , wishing that I had never touched the subject , and earnestly desiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment to think of anything . " If there ai n't any food , " said James with an air of thoughtulmeditation that made his face almost beautiful , " I can eat nclelions , or pine cones , maybe ; or maybe leaves . " Phoebe slipped another slice of pork , wrapped in a flour cake , to James 's mouth , jeering at me with her eyes ; so that I left  --  cm hurriedly , swearing that I would interest myself no more in c affairs of so unaccountable a female as Phoebe Dunn . The colonel stayed at Norridgewock for seven days  --  seven eary days of rain and cold and whistling winds and brown leaves t whirled out of a leaden sky , smelling of sadness and the - year  --  driving each division at top speed in the repairing of its teaux , and the inspection and sorting and repacking of its di-:fished provisions , and in the dreadful mile-long carry up the ky sides of Norridgewock Falls . Not until late on the seventh of October did Colonel Enos 's vision get the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitterly because it had fallen to their lot to be burdened It more provisions and baggage than the other divisions . I looked for Treeworgy and found him carrying loads as heavy as any man , albeit with a face so gray and dolorous that if 1 had been forced to see it often by my side I would have been sickened with sympathetic misery . I have often wondered what evil of Nature is the most nn supportable . There are times when I think that great heat is the worst ; and there are times when I am sure that there is nothing so vile as great cold . But oftenest I have been led to feel that long-continued rain is the foulest of all , with its gloom and dis comfort , the trees and rocks and houses weeping and weeping until every man 's spirits are lowered in fellow feeling , and the earth a morass that plucks at the feet of those who must adventure on it , and the bodies of men and animals steaming and reeking with the chilly damp from which they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many who take pleasure in rainy weather ; or mayhap rain means nothing to men who are in and out of a river like otters during entire days ; for despite their shaky bateaux and their bad food and the recurrent drip of rani which made their hands look soft and flabby , like the body of a clam , the men went poling up the river in no worse spirits than when they left Fort Western , all of them shouting , " ' Whoa ! Whoa ! " to their comrades , or urging them to get out of their bateaux and walk , or asking for the loan of flour to make a paste to stick their bateaux together more firmly . I mind that it rained very violently the day that we might have left Norridgewock , which was the eighth of October , so that we could get no foothold in the mud of the steep carry , and would have been in great danger of bursting our canoes and supplies by falling with them . Therefore we waited until the ninth , hoping for dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel shouted at us that we must have a shot at it . This we did , coming through safely , and so set off after the army . If all our journey could have been through country as rich as that between Norridgewock and Carritunk Falls , and over water no more violent , we might have made a picnicking party of it , nor minded the rain , ever ; for the stream was full of trouts , which we caught in great numbers and ate , and there were large fertile islands lying in the river ; likewise the banks were fertilep317and sloping , cut with the indentations that are called logans on the Kennebec , and above the logans were growths of very large yaks and maples , elms and beeches and ash trees , as well as pines and hemlocks ; so that the bateaumen progressed easily , while the army struck up on the slope to avoid the logans and marched through this fine great forest , over land that was smooth and free of rocks and tangled undergrowth . Thus we were greatly cheered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Captain McCobb and his men , and found the island covered , like all this section of the Kennebec , with a blue joint grass that grows to the height of six feet . Out of this we made the first soft beds that we had enjoyed in many days , and took out trouts from the water with enormous enjoyment , hundreds of them , and dried ourselves by driftwood fires , saying to ourselves that marching through the wilderness was not bad , once we had become hardened to it. * * *We have days , on the coast of New England , that are beautiful and cloudless , with scarce enough wind to set a poplar leaf - tremble . Those who are unfamiliar with the ways of our weather re ravished by such days as these , declaring that there will be succession of them ; but those of us whose daily habits are govruedby the weather know well that they are what we call Gather-breeders , forerunners of storm 's , though we find diffitltyin explaining how a weather-breeder can be distinguished rum a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . o good . Thus it came to us , when we awoke to a bitter cold dawn the xt day and got ourselves over the carry at Carritunk Falls Id embarked on a river that was shallower and more violent td more rock-strewn than any portion that we had yet found , at the easy journeying of the preceding day had been a weatherceder : a period of unnatural calm before a tempest . Beyond the falls we found ourselves suddenly among moun-'ns , some of them capped with snow , very gloomy and overaringcountry , with cold gray clouds pressed tight against the Ip of all the hills and peaks . Likewise , the water was so shoal t for the first time the bateaumen , instead of poling their teaux , or pushing them by hand , must needs get into the water and drag them over obstacles , which is a more exhausting method of progressing , since the labor falls more on the muscles of the stomach . Nor is it a method calculated to improve a bateau , for after one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a hundred times , and wrenched back and forth five or six hundred times in order to coax it over ledges , and jerked ten or twelve miles through the gravel beds of the upper Kennebec , it is bound to find itself near as porous , in spots , as my mother 's nutmeg grater . Even canoes could not be driven through the shoalest spots ; so that we must all of us get into the very bitter cold water , the colonel and Oswald included ; and by the time dusk had fallen we kindled our fires with no great to-do , nor did I hear further remarks concerning the pleasureable features of wilderness travel . I know that I , for one , took a power of joy in the sight of Sugar Loaf Mountain sticking out of the stream dead ahead of us the next morning , after we had been fighting the current and the shallows less than three hours ; for the Sugar Loaf is the landmark of the Great Carrying Place . All along the westerly side of the river , piled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonging to the first three divisions , and their baggage and provisions , and fires for the cooking of the trouts that were hanging by forked twigs on near every low branch in sight , so that a hungry man neede only to help himself . Likewise there was a great tumult , wh with the unloading of bateaux and the shouts of those who craft had been crowded into undesirable positions by newl arrived bateaux , and the passionate curses of those who foun that more of their provisions had been spoiled by the water . Colonel Greene and Captain Morgan came down to the shore and beckoned the colonel to a landing place ; and behind the stood Lieutenant Church , very gloomy and morose , waiting submit his report to the colonel . I looked for Cap Huff , knowing that he had accompanied Church , but I could see nothing for t arm-waving of a tall , gaunt , pale , bearded man who stood beside the lieutenant , holding two raw trouts in his left hand and a half . eaten cooked trout , at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall , pale man bawled at me in evident irritation , that I looked at him more carefully ; and at that I saw it wP319Cap Huff , wasted away to what seemed to me like a shadow , though to a person who had never seen him before he would still look as large as two ordinary men . " Come ashore ! " he bawled , wiping a piece of trout out of his beard . " There are some beautiful walks around here ! " P320AT ITS upper end the Kennebec holds to the Northern wildernessby two tails , one of them a short , false tail which bears off to the northeast and loses itself in Moosehead Lake , and the other a fine , healthy , main tail that branches off to the west , curving and winding and contorting itself among the cold hills and mountains until it ends with its tip pressed tight into the great rock barrier of the Height of Land , in a chain of ponds , diminutive circular ponds , strung on the nethermost end of the coiled , undulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the river well , speak of this true tail as the West Branch , and of the shorter one as the East Branch . Others , because its appearance differs from the rest of the Kennebec , as the tail of a serpent grows darker and loses the markings that prevail on the other portions , have given it a name of its own , calling it Dead River because of the seeming slowness of its current . This is the name that has stuck to the West Branch , and it is the name that I shall give it , though it is truly the Kennebec . For a river that is known as Dead , this west branch is the most active stream that ever I have known ; for it wriggles itself along smoothly until another sixteen miles of wriggling would bring it into its companion stream ; and then , of a sudden , it hurls itself back to the northwestward , in the direction from which it has come , writhing and twisting as though in agony . After twenty miles of tumbling northward over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young bobcat after a rabbit , it swings abruptly to the cast for another twenty miles , joining its companion stream , and is thenceforward known as the Kennebec . Always , since there have been red men or white to follow these highways of the wilderness , travelers to and from the trail over the Height of Land have shunned the northwestward leap of Dead River , and have carried their canoes straight across the Great Carrying Place from the Kennebec to the point wherep321Dead River turns to the north . In the carrying they have been helped by three lakes that lie along the base of the tongue between the two streams ; so that persons who travel light , with small packs and a bark canoe that can readily be borne on the back of one man , moving softly and taking fish and game for food , find little to discommode them in this long carry , if so be they hold to the proper trail . Yet there was something about the looks of Cap Huff that spoke ill for the smoothness of the carry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his appearance improve on closer examination , for his hunting shirt had suffered divers threecorneredrents , and his moccasins had been roughly bound with strips of moose hide . He led me at once to a fire , where he skewered one of his raw trouts on a maple stick and set it to broil . Thereupon he stared at me out of round goggle eyes , very different from his customary genial gaze , and passed the hack of his hand across his brow , shaking his head pessimistically and ejaculating , " Whew ! " as if to imply that his recent experiences had been neither pleasurable nor profitable . " What 's the trouble ? " I asked . " Everything ! " he said promptly . " Do yon mean there 's something wrong with Church ? " I asked , " or was it the traveling that was bad ? Or the food ? " " Food ! " said Cap hoarsely , snatching his trout from the fire and biting at it , but replacing it on the fire when he found it still raw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call food , that is . Just a little here and a little there . " " Did n't anybody have any ? " I asked . " Of course not , " said Cap petulantly . " If anyone had any , I 'd have got it . " " What became of it ? " I asked . " You had plenty when you left . " " We thought we did , " Cap said , " but it disappeared like smoke . And the damned beef was sour . The bread got wet , too . " He looked at me suspiciously . " Have you been getting rain ? " he asked . " All there was , " I told him . He nodded , relieved . " We got so much , " he said , " that I was ( raid there would n't be any left for the rest of you . It got into your bread and burst the barrel . " He sampled his trout again ;  | then looked up at the wisps of gray cloud caught on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rained out , ai n't it ? " he asked . " It 's got to stop , ai n't it ? " I said that I did not know : that we had had a dry summer , and nobody could tell what might happen in the way of weather in this Northern country . Likewise the scar on my forehead , that I had from Guerlac , throbbed each day , though I could not tell whether the throbbing was a sign of evil weather to come . or the result of the wetness of my clothes and the persistence of my labors . " Did you see Natanis ? " I asked . " We did n't see anyone , " he said querulously . " We did n't hear anyone . There had n't ever been anyone where we went , and we went everywhere . We climbed up on every rock and smelled of it , and we jumped into every bog to see how deep it was , and we paddledaround every lake and into every brook and tasted of it ; and if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every tree that was small enough to get our arms or legs around , or hang onto with our teeth . In between times we 'd walk a few miles and measure everything . I tell you , Stevie , this man Church is terrible ! If Arnold had told him to survey the Atlantic Ocean he 'd swim over every inch of it ; and if I was with him he 'd make me dive down and walk all over the bottom like a damned ousel ! " " Did n't you hear anything of Natanis ? " I asked . " Listen , Stevie , " he said , removing his trout from the fire and gnawing at it as one eats an ear of corn , " who do you think would tell us about Natanis ? The squirrels ? Steele 's party will know about him . You can ask them when they get back . They had orders to kill him . I tell you we did n't see anybody . " " Not to kill him ! " I exclaimed . " That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had reliable information that Natanis was a dangerous spy , and gave him orders to shoot him on sight . " Cap tossed the cleaned backbone of his trout on the fire and skewered the other on his maple stick . " What I want to do now , " he said , while I pondered over his news and wondered concerning the source of Arnold 's reliable information , " what I want to do now is to get away from this man Church and get a nice easy job carrying a bateau. "  |p323While  we brooded over the fire Lieutenant Church shambled out of the crowd at the water 's edge and came up past us with a look of settled gloom on his face . I thought he had not seen us ; but he stopped behind Cap and prodded him with his toe . " Getting rested up ? " he asked . " Hell , " said Cap , " it 's going to take me the rest of my life to get rested up and et up . " Church winked at me sadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to me . " Could n't lose him in the woods . " " Good reason , " said Cap bitterly . " If you 'd lost me I 'd never have et again . " " Now , now ! " said the lieutenant , " you 'd been all right if you had n't found that salt codfish . " " What was that ? " I asked . " Why , " said Church with an air of gentle melancholy , " Cap came across a salt codfish lying around in one of the canoes , along about two o'clock one morning , and not wanting to annoy any of the rest of us at that late hour by trying to find out who owned it , he et it all . " " I saved the rest of you a lot of grief , " said Cap . " Yes , " said Church . " We happened to be on Middle Carry Pond that night , the water all mud and bugs and smell , and after Cap et the fish he near drank the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It kind of ruined me , " said Cap . " Well , " said the lieutenant , " we 're starting for Dead River right now , Cap , so leave that trout for Nason and come ahead . " Cap immediately handed me the maple stick , tightened his belt , rubbed his face with his hands , which had become strangely bony , and set off after Church without a word . When I went back to the colonel 's tent , which had been pitched on the rising ground north of the brook that runs in at the start of the Great Carrying Place , I found him busy at the writing of dispatches , keeping an eye meanwhile on the activity of the briny with the bateaux , and ever sending Oswald running to this ptain or that captain with orders or information . Never have I seen such a man , at one moment busying himself with the smallest details having to do with the least of his men , Ind at another moment disregarding all details and bidding everyone else disregard them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after a day of forcing his way through bogs and underbrush , when all of us were drenched with water and perspiration and so weary that some of us would fall asleep with a mouthful of food half chewed  --  at such times I have seen him sit for two hours over his dispatch case , writing letter after letter as though he were fresh from a restful evening in an inn . " Go over the carry , " he said to me , smiling that queer smile of his that lengthened and lightened his round swarthy face . " You 'll have to make two trips to get your own load over . Maybe more . I 'll camp to-night on the far side of the first pond , but you go right ahead and wait for me at the brook that runs into Dead River . " He picked up a piece of paper . " Here , " he added , " Church says the carry to the first pond is three miles and a quarter , a bad road ; then half a mile to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mile and a half to the third pond , a very bad road ; and finally near three miles to Bog Brook , and the last mile of that a devil , muck halfway up your legs . " He waved his pen at me and went back to his writing ; so Hobomok and I unloaded our canoe and made the load into packs , stored all that we could not carry with the baggage dump of Captain Goodrich 's company , shouldered all that we could handle , and fell into the line of those who were setting out across the carry with their bateaux or baggage . Because of the difficulty of the carry , each man took as large a load on his back as he could manage and carried it to the first pond , returning until all the stores for which he was responsible had been transported . Thereupon the bateaux were carried to the first pond , loaded and rowed across , and unloaded again ; and once more the men shouldered the loads . At first it seemed to me that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrel of salt pork , because of its shape and weight , or a barrel of flour ; but in the end all loads came to seem the same . Indeed , the most of us , for a matter of four or five days , were going around with our backs bent over , even when we carried no loads , and some declared that they believed they would grow permanentlyinto this position unless they could be hung up by the hands for a week or so , with weights attached to their feet . For all of Cap Huff 's complaints about his journey with LieutenantChurch , I misdoubt that either of them had properly  |p325a|p|preciated  the true nature of the road over which our bateaumenpassed . Church had traveled light , and before the axemen of the first division had widened the path by felling trees and leaving great multitudes of stumps thrust up a matter of three feet . If he had traveled as the army did , I doubt that he would have been content to call these roads merely bad , or very bad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose he might have been court-martialed for doing so in a formal military report . The bateaux were heavy ; and even when borne on poles by fourmen they weighed most grievously on the stoutest shoulders at the end of no time at all , let alone the time that it takes to travel three miles thus laden . The first carry , being along a mountainside for three and a quarter miles , which I have ever found a sizeable distance to walk even when I am burdened with nothing greater than a musket and a bag of wild fowl , set us all to panting heavily ; and the most of us stripped off our shirts or our coats and rolled them into pads and placed them on our shoulders so that the weight would fall on them . Nor was it the weight alone that bothered us , for the rains that had fallen had made the footing insecure and muddy , and there were spots where a man would plunge his leg knee deep in a mud hole , so that he would fall , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree stumps . Likewise it was impossible to avoid all of these tree stumps ; so that sooner or later every man in every bateau crew drove his knee or his shin against one of them and fell over it , while the bateau clattered clown on him , and the other three carriers were dragged down in the crash . By the grace of God we ate well on this carry , for the first pond was fair alive with salmon trout , pink-fleshed and delicious , so eager for food that they would come into the shallow water to take the hooks , four and five at a time struggling to reach each bait ; and men caught them by standing in the water up to their knees and holding the hooks at the surface of the water , so that they might pull their bait away from any fish that seemed to them too small to merit the expenditure of a worm or a fish eye or a strip of fish belly . When we had dumped our loads on the shores of the first pond we saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemingly an empty bateau ; so we waited for it to land ; and when it had reached us three men got up off the bottom and climbed out , emaciated men with thick beards , their hunting shirts stained and torn and their actions slow and weak . The first of these men I recognized as Lieutenant Steele , who had left us more than two weeks before to scout across the Height of Land and as far as the headwaters of the Chaudiere River . When he left us he was a tall , slender man , who walked with a jaunty swing to his shoulders , smiling constantly , and wore his cap cocked a little on the side of his head : a man who looked fresh and neat in whatever he might be wearing . That is how I recognized him , for his cap was over one ear , and he smiled unceasingly ; but he could not stand still without leaning against a tree , nor could he stand erect , seemingly , for he stooped in his walk ; and at bad places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , they looked as though they had been rubbed with a dead coal from a fire . He would have started back over the long first carry between the Kennebec and the first pond ; so when I told him that Arnold was coming in during the afternoon he threw himself on his back with a groan of satisfaction and relief . He told me , after a little , that we had a greater distance to go than any of us had anticipated  --  more than eighty miles on the Dead River before we could cross the Height of Land and reach the Chaudiere River . I asked him whether it was very bad crossing the Height of Land . It would be a matter of food , he said . If we had enough food we could get across it . Otherwise it might be bad . His own food , he said , had run out , and game was scarce : scarcer than he had ever seen it . They had near starved , all of them , and broken both of their canoes . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like all moose meat : there was no fat on it ; it filled their bellies but gave them no nourishment . Striving to speak carelessly , I asked him the question that seemed to me more important than any other : Had he seen Natanis ? Steele said they had surrounded his cabin to kill him , but 1w was gone , though the cabin had recently been occupied . " He left a birch-bark map for some of his Indian friends , " said Steele , " so we took it and used it . " A great load lifted itself from my heart ; for this meant thatP327Natanis had received my messages and done as I asked . " A map of the country through the Chain of Ponds ? " I asked . " Do you know this Natanis ? " asked Steele quickly . " I have n't seen him in years , " I said . " What sort of Indian is he ? " he asked . " The best there is , " I said . " An Abenaki and a good friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ponds without his map , " said Steele . " Just as well we did n't find him . What made Arnold so hot against him ? " " I wish I knew , " I said . " He could get us plenty of food if Arnold would be willing to use him . " " It was funny about those moose , " said Steele reflectively . " They trotted right out onto us , as if they 'd been driven . " " Did you see any other Indians ? " I asked . " Nary hide nor hair , " said Steele . " That country is as empty as a Tory 's heart , and damned near as cold . " He fell asleep , whereupon I started back across the carry at a trot , so that our canoe might be brought tip with no loss of time . The slowly moving line of bateaumen and laden soldiers stared at me as though I were dangerously daft . I passed Phoebe carrying three muskets over her shoulder , with blankets looped over them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asa Hutchins , walking behind her , bent near double under his load , peered up at me sideways , and croaked : " What 's matter ? Forgetyour shoe buckles ? " We must , I told Hobomok , carry the canoe and the rest of our load at one trip , so that I could find Natanis before anything went wrong . We passed the colonel going in , making good time with no luggage on his back , and having something to say to every bateau crew and every loaded man that he passed . " That 's the way ! " he 'd say . " Stick to it , boys ! We 'll kick up a dust they wo n't forget ! Come on , boys ! They ca n't beat us , boys ! " You could see the bateau crews strike out springier after they 'd heard him . He was a fighter if ever there was one , and then , was scarce one of our men that did n't know it . We got our canoe and the rest of the baggage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other that we had done a fair amount of work , so that we could take it easy for a time ; but we were new at it , or we would never have invited misfortune by such talk . In time we came to know that there was no wearinessso extreme and no labor so great that we could not endure worse when it came , and that it would almost certainly come . When , in the morning , we had crossed the first pond and carried over half a mile of ledges and hard ground , we came to the most evil pond I have ever seen , a low-lying water surrounded by bogs and dead and dying trees , very miserable , of a vile yellow color , with no fish in it , and smelling of decay and corruption . Yet most of us , being dry from the heat of carrying , were hard athirst and so drank the yellow water , which affected us very powerfully , giving us violent pains in our stomachs , and making some of us sick in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us sick . If there had been any stoppage of the steady drift of men plodding toward us with their bateaux on their shoulders , slippingand stumbling and urging one another to untie the rocks from their shoes or to write home for a horse , and calling " Whoa ! Whoa ! " we might have made camp here to boil water and recover from our weakness ; but no man , so long as he could move , seemed willing to stop , fearing , mayhap , lest that might befall them which had befallen a poor wretch from the first division , one Ervin , who had so swollen with rheumatism that he could not move , even to roll himself over in bed ; so he had been left in a brush hut by the second pond , with four men to tend him and turn him over when the pain became too great to bear , and he was grievously afflicted with vermin to boot ; so that after seeing him none of us was wishful of letting himself be sick . We crossed this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the largest one , over a piece of swampy ground near a mile and a half long . On this we floundered very discomfortably , for the path led over a tangle of roots that caught at our feet and tripped us whenever we moved faster than a crawl . Yet the bateaumen , perforce , could not exercise due care in advancing along this carry ; for while the rear bearers of a bateau were hunting with their feet for a safe footing , the front bearers would find one and lurch forward , so that the two rear bearers would be pulled forward in turn and would have to set their feet wheresoever chance dictated . Thus , either the front or the rear bearers were ever tripping and falling , and the bateau sinkingp329down and rising up , so that as we looked back at the line of bateaux crawling along this trail on the shoulders of their bearers it had the look of a great ugly dragon or serpent painfully heaving itself along between the high forest walls through which the axemen had hewn our path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fish in the water  --  dark , deep-bodied , square-tailed trouts  --  and we were all very merry and content on reaching it ; for from it we could see the snow-capped top of Dead River Mountain to the westward , and knew that with one more effort we would be in Dead River . Once in Dead River , we told ourselves , we could go to the very foot of the Height of Land ; so that it seemed to all of us that we were nearing the end of our journey to Quebec . I have often thought , in after years , how very young we were on this journey ; and I have snorted , as men will snort when they grow older , staring up at the ceiling in the gray of dawn , to think that I could have been so green and callow as to think the things that I thought in my early days . I well remember that as we paddled over this third pond I thought to myself it was high time I should be considering what I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Quebec : whether I should first hit Guerlac with a chair and then say to Mary , " Mary , darling , I have loved you ever since you had bare legs with scratches on them " ; or whether I should say nothing , but take her in my arms and kiss her ; or whether I should write out a long speech , very romantic , such as my mother had read to me out of a book by a Mr. Congreve , an Englishman , and recite it to her . It turned out that there was no immediate need of preparing myself for this pleasant task . The length of the carry from the third pond to the little brook that fell into Dead River was three miles . Three miles , we thought , with the memories of our other carries behind us , was nothing but three miles ; and so we doubleloadedour canoe , piling our stores at the ends so that we would not break it in the middle , and set off among the bateaumen of Greene 's division . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withers of a mountain , very steep , so that the skin on our shoulders was rubbed backward very cruelly . Then for another mile we traveled easily down the opposite slope of the mountain , disregardful of the manner in which the skin on our shoulders was being rubbed forward , and hailing each other jocosely at the ease with which we progressed , even though our legs ached as though they would bend and snap under us , and the skin of our faces burned from our exertions until we might near have fried a flounder on them . And finally , ahead of us , we saw a long green meadow , level and beautiful , dotted here and there with thickets and edged with a heavy growth of spruces and cedars , though neither Hobomok nor I could remember this meadow from our trip of many years before  --  nor , indeed , could we remember any of the Great Carrying Place , since it was a firm trail sheltered by heavy trees when we knew it , where now it was a broad churned road , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feet of monstrous heavy wayfarers . So , with light hearts , we stepped out onto this fair meadow , and then we saw what we had not realized until we set foot on it : that it was a bed of rich green moss , growing over a foul , heavy mud of prodigious sliminess , so that our legs sank into the mud well nigh to the knee at each step . If there had been only the mud to suck at our trembling muscles , I make no doubt that we would have come to Bog Brook with no harm done save a little time expended ; but under the mud there were the jagged stumps of ancient trees , and the barbs of decayed branches  --  the graveyard of a forest that had died from floods and fallen before mountain storms , as all ancient forests have fallen in these Northern woods . The stumps and barbs tore at our water-soaked shoes and moccasins and at the skin beneath , nor was there any manner in which we could avoid them or protect ourselves from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip down at each step , nearly to a sitting position , until our feet had reached a foundation , and then we would lift the canoe forward eight inches or even a foot , and then drag our feet from the mud and take another step . There was one fool near the center of the meadow , I remember , one of a crew of bateaumen , who would scream horribly at intervals , shrieking , " There 's something near my feet ! " or " I just stepped on something ! " or " I know I walked on a fish ! " In the course of time , after this fool had screamed , therep33Iwould be a shout of " What is it ! " from the entire line of soldiers , whereupon the fool would shriek , " Fish ! " and we would move forward another eight inches . In the course of time we came to narrow Bog Brook , its waters brown and smelling of deadness ; but each of us , as he reached it , lowered himself into it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soused himself up and down until the sweat and the slime and the stench of the mud had gone from him . Thereupon , desirousof seeing no more of the Great Carrying Place , ever , those whose luggage was entirely carried set off down Bog Brook , one by one ; and we could hear them , across the meadow that separates the brook from Dead River , bawling at each other as they went poling up against the river 's sluggish current . As for those others who had brought only a part of their belongings , they would set off across the dreadful meadow again , sinking through the fair , level green moss into the foul mud , pitching forward or sideways as their feet struck the snags and barbs of the stumps beneath , and dragging out their blackened feet and legs and struggling slowly onward . When we had washed ourselves we stored our baggage on a little knoll of high land on the far side of the brook and without more ado-set off down Bog Brook ourselves . I knew , when we turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was little use in following the bateaux upstream ; for it seemed to me that Natanis would do one of two things : either send a messenger to me at night when he had located me ; or watch for me himself at the point where I must enter Dead River . Therefore we turned downstream , away from the bateaux , and drifted with the current . There were three crows on a tall pine , a little downstream from us , and as we drifted the three of them sprang into the it with an excited cawing and flew directly toward a twisted bull pine that stood in a thicket on the far side of the river . Around this tree they circled , and as they did so other crows came from downstream and swerved and swooped over the tree , raising an outcry that came faintly to us . Hobomok grinned and drove the canoe downstream . " Natanis is talking to the crows , " he said . We went ashore abreast of the old bull pine ; and in the thicket beneath it we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as were we to see them . It had been many years since I had seen Natanis , yet he had changed almost not at all from the boy we had rescued from the deer , save that his face was thinner and harder , and the muscles under his skin more corded . I could see from the way in which he examined me , feeling of my arms and ribs , that there was more of a change in my appearance , nor could I blame him for his curiosity at my looks ; for my beard had grown raggedly and my eyes were hot and sunken from the sickness at Middle Carry Pond and from the struggle with the mud ; also my hunting shirt and breeches were sadly torn , and the soles had near parted from my shoes , so that my feet stuck through in places . " We have waited here for my brother , " Natanis said , hunting in his quiver for his pipe , " since the men with rifles first came into the river , but I would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear is a great m'teoulin , had not come with him . " " What is all this talk , " I asked , going straight to the point , " that you are a spy ? " Natanis lighted the pipe and gave it to me , and I found it very welcome in spite of the sumach leaves and powdered willow bark with which the tobacco was mixed . " We must think about this , " he said , hunkering down over his fire which , like most Indian fires , was small enough to be held in the palm of the hand . " This tale comes from some man who does not wish your war party to have my help . " " Why do you think this , Natanis ? " " Because when the stupid guide Conkey came into this country he asked immediately whether I was a spy , showing he had been told that I was a spy ; but since I am not a spy , and have never been a spy , and have neither thought of being a spy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have had its start so that your soldiers would be suspicious of me and fear me . " " I think this is true , " I said , " because the great chief Washingtonand the chief of this army , Arnold , had been told in August that you were an enemy to us . " " I do not understand this , " Natanis said , " for no person from this section has gone to the settlements since that time . It may be that I am at fault in some small way ; for when the foolishp333Conkey asked whether I was a spy , I said to him , Of course I am a spy , because I deliver myself into your hands and sit by your fire , instead of hiding in the forest and watching your movements without danger to myself . Next I shall write on a piece of bark " I am a spy " and hang it around my neck , so that there may be no mistake about it . ' I thought that by saying thiswould show the foolish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish . I saw at once that I was mistaken ; for he feared me , and went away without exploring the river or the Height of Land , and without asking me for a drawing of them , which I would have given him for the asking . " " The white scout Steele , with the seven men , " I said , " had orders to kill you because you are a spy . " Natanis nodded . " I saw them , " he said , " when they came into the river . I prepared a map , as you asked , and left it in a cleft stick before my cabin while I could hear their voices approaching . I saw them creep up on my cabin with cocked rifles ; and Natawammet and I followed them to the top of the Height of Land . For a time they were without food , and I drove rabbitsand raccoons into their path . Being too hurried to look about hem , they could not see these small creatures ; so at length , caring that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moose into the river ahead of their canoes . " " I think that Steele suspects this , " I said . " He is a good man . " " He is a good man , " Natanis agreed . " He has gone forward award the Height of Land again  --  this morning  --  with axemen lid two other officers , one a gloomy man , and the other very 1 rge , with a roaring voice . " " Church and Cap Huff ! " I exclaimedHobomok laughed . " This Cap Huff will melt away like the now , " he said , " and there will be nothing left but his voice . " " These men are your friends ? " Natanis asked . " Yes , " I said , " and men that will do us great good . " " Rut take care , " said Hobomok , " to leave no food where oaring Voice can get it ! " " I wish , " I said to Natanis , " that I could learn the truth of this 1k that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paddled by . teas and Sabatis . How does this happen , do you think , and mild either of them have reason to wish you dead ? " Natanis shook his head . " Eneas , " he said , " was in Becancourp334visiting his brothers during the two hot moons of the summer . and he returned here in September , departing to hunt with Sabatis at once , so he could have said nothing to the white chic f in August . Sabatis has fished and hunted on the lower Kennebec for three years past , and Eneas has often hunted with him . We are neither friends nor enemies ; and I do not know why the white chief should entrust himself to them , unless it is because they are very good paddlers . " " Well , God knows what the answer may be to all this , " I said . " but there is one more thing : the winter that we returned after building your cabin , my father died because of his kindness to a violent and sour-faced preacher named Ezekiel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " The angry man . " " There is a man named Treeworgy with this army , " I said , " a very gloomy man who looks greatly like Hook but says that he has no knowledge of him . Do my brothers know anything of this Treeworgy ? " " I will look at him , " said Natawammet , when Natanis shook his head . " And what about Paul Higgins with his Assagunticooks ? " 1 asked . " He is on the Height of Land , " said Natanis , " keeping out of the way of the white men until they begin to starve to death . " " Do you think they are going to starve to death ? " I asked . Natanis shrugged his shoulders . " There is an aching in my scar , " he said , touching the blue welt along his side where the deer 's hoof had slashed him at the moment when my father and I had first seen him . " There will be storms , I think ; bad storms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have ever seen it . You would think that the rabbits had been wiped out , there are so few of them ; and the animals that feed on the rabbits are fewer than in other years . Also the moose are moving to the west . I take no pleasure in it , for I have seen nothing like it in all the years I have been here . " " Well , " I said , " I will lay the whole matter before you . I say to Natanis that he is my brother , and that these men with whom I am marching are also my brothers . I am in need of a brother 's help , and I expect now that my brother will help mep335in every way that he can , and all my other brothers with me , for we are coming to very bad times . " " That has been in my mind , " said Natanis . " I had my life at my brother 's hands , and I am ready to help him while that life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the four of us smoked in turn . " Now , " I said , " the food is very low , and the army can not stop to hunt for food ; for when it stops it ceases to be an army , and loses the strength which is given to it by the fear of others ' laughter and the desire of equaling others ' efforts . Therefore the day may come when it is entirely without food . Furthermore , the bateaux are rickety and dangerous , and I misdoubt that they can be carried across the Height of Land ; so that there may be no means for the army to reach Quebec once it has got safely to the Chaudiere . " It will be necessary for this army to be watched carefully ; and if it is true , what I suspect , there must be fast men sent to the French settlements to spread the word to bring in food ; and there must be men set to building canoes on the lower Chaudiere for the crossing of the St. Lawrence ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see that they do not stray away from the trail or die from lack of food or suffer any hurt . All of this ou must talk over with Paul Higgins and his men , deciding  --  tween you how it can best be done ; and whatever happens , . o word of this army should be spoken to any person who will - : rry the information to the English . When the thing has been . ecided , Natanis should return to me , looking for me by nightthe camp of the white chief Arnold . No guard is kept , andis safe for red brothers to move anywhere among the army t might ; for there are already more than twenty Abenakis amongmostly Swan Islanders and scattered braves from Arrowsic ml Georgetown . " " This shall be done , " said Natanis . " It is in my mind , " I said , " that the day will soon come when hose who have said that Natanis was a spy will burn in hell , ml that if we are able to take Quebec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it without Natanis and his brothers . " With that we feasted on strips of moose meat dipped in weetened bear 's fat , and very toothsome it tasted after the salt , irk and trout that had sustained us for many days past.  | There are times , indeed , when I am bemazed at the human stomach , for there are seasons when I turn up my nose at partridgesand ducks , cooked juicily over the coals , and long for salt pork and trout ; and there are other times when I am like to gag if anyone so much as shows me a trout and a slice of pork ; and yet I have seen the day when the sweetest food in all the world was a strip of pork rind , raw , that had lain for a week in the bottom of an Abenaki woodchuck-skin wallet. 0P337Fox four more days the army wallowed back and forth across the stinking , moss-topped swamp at Bog Brook , all of it except Enos 's Fourth Division , which fiddled along behind all the rest , ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for it . One by one Greene 's rear guard washed themselvesclean of mud and stench and poled off down the brook . Morgan 's riflemen , with their canvas jerkins torn and frayed from their road-making labors , had fallen back to second place for the first time , so that Greene 's men jeered at them . Yet Morgan 's men and the Pennsylvania riflemen , ordinarily very proud of their ability and speed , had no retorts to make except most perfunctory ones , so that I was constrained to give the matter some study . Meigs 's division pulled itself out of the mud and went out slowly . For the first time , because of the foul yellow water at Middle arry Pond , each bateau carried a sick man or two , and in some ases three or four  --  some of them so weakened by the flux hat they could no longer hold their places in the line of foot soldiers , and some of them with feet torn on the snags and barbs f the bog , and some crippled with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer stand upright . When the men of Goodrich 's company , having finished with their carrying , threw themselves down on the bank , waiting for he bateaux to start , I saw Phoebe among them and so went over to speak to her . As ever , she was beside James Dunn , loving around him like a sparrow moving around a log ; for he ' as stretched out at full length , his clothes in a very wretched ate and a gray cast to his face that I liked little . Nor was hoebe much better off ; for her moccasins had completely worn t her feet , so that the upper parts had been pulled up on her gs to afford added protection from the attacks of bushes and Lumps , and the moccasins had been replaced with bags of moose  |p338hide  , lashed around her ankles and insteps with various things , among which I saw a snake skin and a piece of sacking . Also her buckskin jerkin was sadly ripped and stained and her eye discolored from running into a tree or falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unbeaten look about her , such as I have seen in my dog Ranger when his coat is dirty and filled with thorns and burrs , and his feet sore from scrambling through briars and over rocks , and he perks up his ears on seeing me approach a thicket in which there may be a covey of partridges or belike a fox . " Steven , " she said , as I came up , " James must go in a bateau . He is n't fit to march . " " I 'm as good as any man , " said James , without opening his eyes . I looked at his shoes , and they were still holding together , though there were cracks and splits in them that showed they would last little longer . Nor , when I prodded him , were his ribs near sticking through his flesh , as on some that I had seenso I told Phoebe that it might he better for him to keep going rather than to give in to any weakness , since he might grow stronger instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those who were more in need of help . " Are there many in the bateaux ? " asked James with a trace of eagerness , opening both eyes to look at me . " There 's a sick man or two in every one , " I said , " but we can always find room for you if you need it . " " I 'm better than any of those sick ones , " said James , sinking back comfortably against the grass that Phoebe had thrown behind him . Phoebe looked at me with a dumb , baffled look . Then she leaned over and patted James on the shoulder . " You 're better than a lot of the well ones , " she said . Noah Cluff , patching the knee of his breeches with a square of wet buckskin , grinned behind his whiskers fearsomely . " You ai n't so bad yourself , Phoebe , " he said . The scar on my forehead ached and smarted , on the fourth day of our waiting , as though newly branded with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air , and a veil of snowp339over the top and sides of Dead River Mountain . Early that afternoon we saw the colonel and Captain Oswald struggling across the meadow . Two other Indians , Swan Islanders , had replaced Eneas and Sabatis in the colonel 's canoe ; and from them we learned that Arnold had sent Eneas and Sabatis with dispatches to friends in Quebec , sympathizers with our cause  --  a piece of information that put me in a sullen temper for a time , until I took thought that they well knew the way to Quebec , and remembered that I had nothing against them save that they had been a party to the stealing of Mary Mallinson many years before . I would be , I saw , a fool indeed to run with suspicions and complaints to the man on whose shoulders rested all the burden of our venture and all the worries of our situation ; nor could anyone remain in an ill temper with Colonel Arnold when he was happy at being on the move . Seeing us on the far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pole from a bateau and ran with it to the edge , thrusting one end against the ground and vaulting over by holding to the other end , as easy as I would step over a log . " The worse of it 's over , " he said , pleased as a boy when we gave him Me tails of the two beavers that we had shot for him . " We 'll be halfway up Dead River to-night , and at the gates of Quebec before you can say Boh to a goose ! " Yet his face had lost its cheerfulness when we had been at ' our paddling for a matter of three hours ; for the river twines and twists around the foot of Dead River Mountain , dark and glistening and silent , as though it waited , listening and moving very imperceptibly , to gather a victim in its coils . When , therefore , a person sets out upon it he sees the frowning bulk of the mountain at his left shoulder , and he paddles straight ahead and then he turns off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left and then he turns to the right , and then to the left and right again ; and at the end of the three hours of ceaseless twining , the gloomy mountain is still at his left shoulder , no farther away and no : tearer than when he started . ITalf an hour before sundown we came to the beautiful point on which we had built the cabin for Natanis , my father and I ; at Id my mind turned back to the day when the two of us had taken a drink to red-headed James Wolfe for the taking of Quebec ,  | and I wished to God that my father could have been sitting in the canoe with us , going on a journey that would have brought him happiness , whatever its outcome . I think that Hobomok read my thoughts ; for he said that there was a belief among the Abenakis that when they went to war the spirits of their fathers went with them to give them strength and protection . Such things , it seems to me , are vain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I thought to myself that if what he said was true no Britisher that ever lived could stop me from going over the walls of Quebec and taking away that which I most wanted . By nightfall we had passed well beyond Natanis 's cabin and come among the bateaux of Colonel Greene 's division ; so when we came to a likely meadow on the top of a high bank we encampedthere all together , well pleased because the snow had stopped and the river was full of salmon trouts , with no shallows to wet us . Only the scar on my head stung and throbbed to a degree that led me repeatedly to lay my fingers against it and then examine them carefully , fearful lest it might have burst open . Before the night was over there began to be murmurs here and there ; for it appeared that companies that supposed themselves to have three and four barrels of flour had found no flour when their bateaux came to be searched . At first it was thought that the flour belonging to one company had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when all the flour in all the companies of Greene 's division was scraped together it was found that there was only enough for each man to have one-half pint , which is scarce enough , God knows , to keep my dog Ranger from the pangs of hunger for the half of a day . Hobomok and I were making cakes out of the meal that we carried in bladders for emergencies when Captain Oswald came past us in a great pother . " Did you take the flour ? " he asked , eyeing our cakes suspiciously . " Nay , " I said , " not I ; and I have known enough to guard or hide what I have got . " " Well , " said Oswald , " this division is in a pretty mess , with next to nothing to eat , so we must draw on Enos for reserve supplies . " With that he started off , but came back to me again . " WhatJP341did you mean , " he asked , " by saying that you knew enough to hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant ? " I returned testily , for I was in an evil humor because of the throbbing of my scar , which seemed to tap on the front of my brain like a hammer from our smithy . " I suppose you meant , " said Oswald , " that if you had not hidden your supplies they would have been stolen . " " That is what I meant , " I said , " for I long ago learned that f uod , or anything else for that matter , can not safely be left near any body of men , unless they be Indians ; and indeed it is becomingdangerous to trust Indians overmuch , now that they have benefited by the society of their white neighbors . " " What are you trying to say ? " said Oswald sternly . " Listen to me , " I bade him , " I am trying to say nothing ; but you are nosing about in search of a mystery , and I am trying to help you say something , if so be you wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are opinions concerning this army that are more valuable than my own , and I wish only to march to Quebec with the rest of you , and to help you fight in whatever way I can . Other persons must advance the opinions . " " Very well , " said Oswald , " I 'll advance the opinions if I can find out what maggot is crawling in your head . " " The maggot is this , " I said . " Daniel Morgan is a hard driver and a proud man , as you well know because of his refusal to serve under Greene , and God knows this is a spectacle that will not be equaled in some time : a captain refusing to serve under a lieutenant colonel . Also , Morgan 's riflemen are hard men , good soldiers ; better than any we have , belike , but well aware of their own excellence and nothing loath to parade it before any other Ian or any other company of men . " I stopped ; but Oswald stood gawping at me expectantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before him , but must have is nose rubbed in the whole business . " It is very simple , " I id . " Morgan and his Virginians , and the rest of the riflemen or that matter , well know that they are capable of holding first lace in the line of march against us clumsy New Englanders , Nether they go by bateau or by land ; and before they would ve up first place in the line to Greene 's men or anybody else ,  | without an excellent reason , they would work their legs to stumps and tear the flesh from their fingers . " Oswald nodded , with a look of comprehension coming into his eyes . " Morgan 's men were not so busy at road-making , " I said , " that they could not have held first place in the line if they wished ; for Greene 's men set off up Dead River less than two hours ahead of them . " " That is so , " said Oswald . " Of course it is so , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men either , have allowed Greene 's division to precede them by little more than an hour without a fight , as they did , unless they had a reason for wanting Greene 's division out of the way before they launched their own bateaux ? No , they would not ! Daniel Morgan would have bawled like our cow when she is overladen with milk , and his men would have pushed Greene 's men into the bog and trampled on them , rather than let them start first ! What is more , there is a good reason why Morgan 's men did not catch up with Greene in no time , so that they might either be camping with Greene 's men at this moment , or be camping a league ahead . " " Finish it up , " said Oswald . " So I will , " I said . " Morgan 's men lagged behind at the Great Carrying Place to give Greene 's men a chance to pass through them ; and while they were passing through Morgan 's men stole their flour ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said , " and then they let Greene 's men start off down Bog Brook ahead of them so that Greene 's men could not see the extra flour packed in Morgan 's bateaux . " " Well , the dirty rats ! " said Oswald . " No , " I said , " there is more than one way of looking at that . I remember my father telling me how the men from his company , during the siege of Louisbourg , stole thirty lobsters that had been caught by Lieutenant Benjamin Cleaves 's men ; and it is in my mind that men have stolen food in all wars , even those fought by the Egyptians . Also , these Virginians are no psalm-singing deacons , but very rough and reckless citizens who would break their rifle stocks over the heads of persons who displeased them , whether they were patriots or Tories ; andIP343since they hold themselves to be more valuable soldiers than the rest of us , which I think they are , there is little wonder that they think nothing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons of less importance . So it seems to me that if there is anyone to be blamed it is Morgan 's captains for not keeping a stricter hold on their men , or Greene 's captains for not stationing a guard over the men 's victuals . " " Could you prove these things ? " asked Oswald cautiously . " I shall refuse to appear in the matter , " I said . " I give you the information to use as you wish . " " Then say nothing concerning your suspicions , " he said , " and I will see how to use the information . " " Indeed , " I said , " I have no wish to see Morgan 's and Greene 's divisions at each others ' throats , so I will be silent . There is one other thing , " I added as Oswald started away . " I have given you information ; now give me some in return . Where did the colonel learn about his messenger Eneas and about the guide Treeworgy , who is with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he was still at Crown Point , " said Oswald . " As long ago as that ! " I said . " Where did this information come from ? From Boston ? " Oswald hesitated and muttered something about secret intelligence . " I swear to my God , " I said , " that I will keep this secret as well as you or Arnold , and that I want it only because I mislike certain things that I have seen about this army , and would like to protect all of us from any harm . " " Well , " said Oswald , hunkering down close beside me , " he s correspondents in Quebec . This information came from one of them . " " Will you spit it out ! " I whispered to him , irritated by the throbbing of my scar and by the withholding of the name that I hoped to hear . " Who was the man ? " " His name , " whispered Oswald reluctantly , " is John Wood-ard . " " John Woodward ! John Woodward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointment . " Who in the devil is John Woodward and where does he live and how does he know about Eneas and Treeworgy ? "   " I do not know that , " said Oswald . " The colonel lets me copy letters to him in the letter book , but the address he withholds until the letters are given to the messenger , if indeed it is given at all ; for he says that Woodward would be killed if it should he known in Quebec that he was sending information to us . " With this , which helped me but little , I was forced to be content. *The wind was in the southwest when we threw off our blankets the next day , and I could not understand the unceasing throbbing of my scar , for a southwest wind with us brings only short storms for the most part , not enough to set a small scar to burning and pounding as mine was doing . Immediately the colonel dispatched Major Bigelow and twelve bateaux to get provisions from Colonel Enos , so that Greene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and since Enos was still fuddling around on the Great Carrying Place , meaning that the provisions would be a matter of three or four days in corning up , the rest of us went to work catching trouts to satisfy the hunger of the entire division  --  an easy task because the river was alive with them , and all of the same size , seemingly , each one weighing about half a pound . Morgan 's division passed us at noon , the men poling and paddling very busily on the far side of the river , and content , for once , to hurl none of their jeers at Greene 's men . They were a hardy lot , these riflemen ; for when one of our fishermen calleacross to a bateau , asking how their flour was holding out , and the bateauman shouted back , very seriously , " We 're eating fish Brother , and saving our flour , " not one of Morgan 's bateaume so much as smiled , but hustled grimly on upstream , whereas looked for some of them to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass the time of day wit Arnold ; and Oswald told me afterward that Arnold said only one thing to him  --  " Captain , I shall expect your division to he always in the lead hereafter , and first into Quebec . " Oswald said that Morgan stared at him for a moment as if he intended to be haughty and thick of understanding , and then changed his mind very suddenly , saying , " Sir , that is our fixed intention " ; but I am sure that whatever Morgan had replied , Arnold wouldp345have said no more , lest the welfare of the army be further endangered ; for if ever a man would have sacrificed pride or health or his life to see our campaign succeed , it was Arnold . Being , as the colonel said , so near to our destination , the men were put to work making cartridges and packing them in barrels ; and when the Third Division had come up behind Morgan 's and made their cartridges and gone on , the colonel said that we could serve no good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on behind Meigs . The men were catching rides on the bateaux , walking across the neck of land at wide bends in the river , and then begging rides until they came to another neck . I saw James Dunn lurch out of one of the bateaux , with Phoebe , strangely deformed-looking , pushing at him . I shouted at them to know how their food was holding out and went closer to see what ailed Phoebe . James walked on without raising his head ; but Phoebe lifted the buckskin jerkin over her hip and I saw a raccoon dangling from her brass-studded belt by his hind legs . " Jacataqua ! " she called to me . " I almost had to hit Burr withis to get it away from him ! " She waved her leather-boundfilets at me gaily and steered James around a young pine thicketrough which he seemed about to walk . The proceedings of the next few days are grouped in my mind ound a Friday  --  not because I think that Fridays bring evil , t because so many of our greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse things happened to us on other ys , especially on Sundays , which I have never heard called a y that brings evil . At any rate , it was on the day before a Friday that this bad siness started : on Thursday , that is , the nineteenth day of tuber . It was raining when we came out of our blankets , a hi rain , very disagreeable , nor was the cheerlessness of the ' n relieved by the appearance of the country , which seemed flat as a salt marsh in the direction we were moving , with barren spots on the soil and the trees smaller , as if they had n starved , and all of them pines and spruce and fir , with no pleasant maples or elms or oaks such as help to make the Arundel countryside so beautiful . Likewise , the river grew narrower , with very pestiferous littlep346rapids and falls at frequent intervals ; and for fear of upsetting ourselves and losing more of our provisions , we must needs carry around each one of them , slipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which we laid our hands because of its wetness . The rain came in bursts , as if the clouds were ripping in spots and letting masses of goose shot fall in the water . The wind , too , blew harder and harder from the southwest , so that our skins grew very chilled and numb from the driving of the rain against us and through our garments ; and when we camped at our last portage we were more than two hours in finding dry wood and starting our fires . The wind blew from the southwest still and we could not believe that it would last ; yet when Friday morning broke the wind was higher , moaning most dolorously through the spruces and dead tamaracks , and the rain was heavier , bouncing a foot from the surface of the river and from the meadows , and whirling upward from the force of the wind until a person who stood in it without cover was rained on from above and below . Thinking that it must let up soon , we lay snug in our lean-to 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bateaumen oozing water like ledges of rock over which a wave has just broken . When Phoebe trudged past us , sandwiched between Jame Dunn and Noah Cluff like a sandpiper walking at the surf 's edge in the rain between two curlews , I called to her to come and g dry . Her buckskins were plastered to her body and there were bluish shadows under her eyes and around her mouth , as thong some of the color had run out of the handkerchief she wo around her hair ; but she shook her head grimly and pulled James Dunn to his feet when he stumbled ; and when he did so I sa that there was no sole to one of his shoes . This , with the drenching rain and the mournful sky , led me t think gloomily on the folly of women , and how they cleave most faithfully to those of us who are weakest and most worthless , an to wonder whether this be true , or whether it only seems totrue because our attentions are attracted to weak and worthless men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiv or mothers as good as those of more deserving folk . Inch by inch the water rose on the banks , and the stream moved ever faster , bringing down all manner of leaves and tree scrap.  |p347and  sods and foam ; and great trouts came up from the bottom of the stream , trouts so dark that they looked purple , and rolled on the surface , snatching at grubs and worms , and slapping with their tails at those they could not eat . That Friday night the rain fell as I had never known it to fall before , in solid sheets , like water pouring out of a hogshead , and the wind rampaged very terribly among the trees , coming in bursts that increased constantly in strength , as the strength of a titan 's breath increases when he fails in an attempt to blow out a candle , though with each succeeding burst we said to each other that it could blow no harder . There was a smashing among the trees in the forest behind us from time to time ; so at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force of the storm hold us in our encampment or work some greater inconvenience on us . I have been through storms in my life that were fit to rank with any storms at all anywhere  --  northeasters that would drive rain through the outer walls of a house and the wooden wainscoting within , and northers that would whip snow into a man 's face with rich force as to peel off the skin , and squalls out of the southestthat would roll a dory over twice and blow the plug out of thettom in doing it ; but never anywhere have I seen a storm thatre at us and drenched us and hurled us about as this storm on Bead River . The water in the river had risen a great distance , three feet yhap , and the falls to which we were constantly coming were hite smothers of foam . When we fought our way up through e bateaux of the Third Division , near blinded by the rain that lashed and tore at us , we found them shipping more water from e downpour than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a howl to the wind that seemed to be de by living creatures , and noises above our heads like great tubers of screech owls screaming in unison . Whenever the cam passed among trees , there was a creaking and splitting long them that sent us past them with all the speed that we could muster ; and all along the edges of the forests there were wly fallen pines . In the afternoon we passed an open meadow in which stood one I pine , twenty-eight inches in diameter at the base , belike , a very e tree ; and as we passed it the whole tree rose a little in the air and fell over on its side , tearing up in its fall a flat patch of earth bigger than the floor of our kitchen in Arundel . Nor did it totter and fall slowly , as a pine falls when it has been cut at the base ; but with a violent quick fall , as a musket falls when a clumsy man stumbles over its stock . A little after that the stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose a gentle hill slope , forested with pines and spruces . There was a rushing roar in the air , very menacing and unlike anything I had ever heard , and on the instant an irregular patch of healthy green trees on the hill slope , a patch three or four acres in extent , flattened themselves down to the earth as if they had been sat upon by an enormous invisible giant . We came up with Morgan 's riflemen at dusk , finding them encampedon a low point clear of trees and huddling in the lee of their bateaux , without fires . Misliking this place because of the nearness of the water and the lack of shelter , and being eager for some place where we might kindle fires , we continued another mile onward in the gloom and the howling wind and rain until we came to a high ledge that would give us shelter from the falling trees , which were going down on every hand amid a most hellish tumult . Here , under the ledge , we found dried twigs , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being and got warm food into us , and heated our clothes until they were no longer like wet fish against us when we moved . It was near midnight when we rolled ourselves in our blankets . I was desirous of listening to some conversation between Colonel Arnold and Captain Oswald , in which the colonel was telling what ought to be done to any ninny who would name this the Dead River ; but after I had heard him say that this man , whoever he was , ought to be dragged on the end of a rope through all the falls that we had carried around , I thought to myself that such draggingwould leave him less water-logged than we were , and with that I lost consciousness . It was still as dark as the middle of a wet feather bed when I was awakened by a great shouting ; and while I lay numbly , thinkingthat they had caught the man who named it Dead River , a wave slapped me in the face and water soaked through my blanket and ran coldly down my thigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others were splashing around in water , and as I urolled myself and got to my feet I saw that the river had comeP349the way up the bank , a most prodigious rise , for we had camped more than my own height above the surface of the flood . Our canoes were under water , and the most of our supplies and baggage . Some of it we found and dragged out , by dint of groping around under water like a herd of seals , and tumbling head first into the river a score of times , after which we carried it to the risingground behind us and sat there shivering until dawn , the rain having ceased and the wind grown colder . Though the dawn came in less than two hours , it seemed like ten to me ; and I fear it seemed longer to the colonel , for I could hear him making little noises of distress with his tongue against the roof of his mouth , though he kept his troubles to himself ; and God knows he had plenty of them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that near everything had happened to us hat should not have happened . When the dawn of Sunday came we saw a strange sight ; for here there had been a river flowing regularly between its banks n the day before , there was now a great lake with trees rising from it here and there , and falls occasionally , very white and angry-looking , and a current so swift that small trees bent beoreit . By dint of much wading we assembled enough wood for a teat fire ; and leaving our clothes before it to dry , we dragged rselves on the bottom of the flood until we had saved what we uld of our baggage , though some of our food had washed away that we could not find it , and one of our bladders of cornmeal d a pair of Oswald 's shoes which could ill be spared ; for shoes ted no time at all because of the repeated wettings and dryings t they suffered . All of our things we unpacked and ranged the fire to dry . Morgan 's division came by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very hard against the current and shouting out their %vs to us : how their bateaux had been sunk and smashed and tried away by the flood , and how pork and flour out of their lily stores had been washed away in the twinkling of an eye , r ever found again , and muskets carried into the depths of the river . We were fair numbered by all these things , and with each ce of evil tidings our spirits grew lighter , as though the hearing of had relieved us of another tribulation . Our friends , as they came by , would shout at us to find out what we had lost , and when we would shout back ,  --  ' Nothing but most of our food ! " they would laugh very hilariously and say that they had lost five bateaux and a barrel of pork and two kegs of powder , whereat we would all double up with merriment , slappingourselves and declaring that there was still life in the 01 ( 1 Dead River . When we heard how the foot soldiers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike back all the way to the high land in order to go forward , you might have thought it was the gayest news that had come to us since the tea was thrown into Boston Harbor . And when we went to fishing to eke out our scanty provisions , and found that the big trouts had all gone away , belike into the newly flooded land , leaving nothing for us to catch save little minnows no bigger than my thumb , the dragging out of each minnow would be greeted by howls of pleasure from all who saw it . And indeed I have found it true that the parlous situationsare the ones that bring the greatest laughter and peace of mind to those whose courage has not been wholly shattered by sickness or by injustice . Why this is so I do not know , unless it be that all worries concerning the past and the future are wiped from the mind , and the immediate present stands out absurdly clear and small against the background of impending danger. * * *On Monday we went on again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been in a longer time than I could remember , and found our selves mixed in with Meigs 's division and Morgan 's division , a of them proceeding against the violent current as best they coul pushing and pulling on trees and drawing themselves along b submerged hushes , for the depth of the water coupled with i quickness made the bateaux difficult to handle by means of poleWe had thought that the worst was over , and that with the big water we could go on quickly to the Height of Land ; yet we h no sooner started than we found that the foot soldiers of Meigs division had mistaken their way and gone traveling up a branch the Dead River that would lead them to God knows where a leave them lost in this very terrible wilderness with no food at Therefore Arnold dispatched me with Hobomok to bring th back . We had gone two leagues , belike , when we heard a squirp351high in a tree on the left bank , making a most prodigious outcry , cursing and flirting his tail and stamping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this , Hobomok laughed and swung the canoe ; and under the squirrel 's tree I saw Natanis smiling at us . He spread his hands out on either side of him , looking at the water and shaking his head . " I think , " said he , " that the great lord Glooskap and Wuchowsen the Wind Bird have been fight-ing . " " Where does this water come from ? " I asked . Natanis raised his eyebrows . " There has been nothing like this , " he said , " in my memory , nor have such numbers of trees been felled by the wind at one time during the life of these trees . It is ) ad . " " Some of our men have taken a wrong direction , " I said . " Have you seen them ? " " I met them three bends above here , " he said . " I led them across the stream where there were fallen logs , and sent them across to the river , a march of three hours . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked pityingly at me . " I said I had been sent after them by the white chief . " " Was there a small white woman among them , wearing a blue handkerchief on her head ? " " Yes , " said Natanis . " A better man than some of them , I think . " It might be , I thought to myself , that what Natanis said was rue ; and yet I had her on my mind a dozen times a day , wishing at she were back in Arundel where she belonged , keeping my other company instead of making herself a nuisance around a n 's army and occupying men 's thoughts when they should be sy on other matters . It may be that I felt more put out at Phoebe and at Mrs. Grier and Mrs. Warner for marching with their husbands among the riflemen , because it was impossible for me to have my thoughts to Mary Mallinson , as I liked to do when we steamed comfortably before our campfires at the end of the day 's 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y head most pestilentially and setting me to wondering about her . d and her condition when I had no desire to wonder about her all.  | " There is no need to be concerned about her , " added Natanis , who had been watching my face , " for she has the body of a boy , that can stand anything . " He touched the blue scar on his side and smiled affectionately at me , as if to remind me what he himself had endured as a boy without taking hurt . " Nay , " I said , " I am not concerned about her . Have you told the others what I said ? " Natanis nodded . " Paul Higgins has sent four men down the Chaudiere to make canoes and carry word to the settlements that food must be brought in to Sartigan , the first of the settlements . Also they will send word to any Abenaki hunting parties that may be hunting along the Chaudiere , and whatever they see they will kill for the army . " " And the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Height of Land to Lake Megantic . This is very bad country ; and they will do what they can . " " Well , " I said , " I know of nothing more that can be done ; so follow the foot soldiers ; and when we have camped to-night , come up behind our fire and we will talk further . " With that we put back to Dead River where the others were waiting , and found the colonel very fidgety and lump-faced from inaction . He heaved a sigh of relief when I told him that the foot soldiers had cut across country . " Now , " he said , " we can kick up a dust and be done with all this delay ! We might have rowed the. bateaux to Havana and back in the time it has taken to come u this broken-backed river ! " We pushed on up against the devilish current , all of us t gether , bawling and whooping at each other because the rain w over and the worst of our troubles behind us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put little faith in our Arundel habits of rapping on wood or spitting over the left shoulder in order to prevent the souring of a hope or the overturning a confident assertion . Yet I wish that instead of holloing and whooping that October afternoon we had gone on our way wi such a rapping on wood as would have sufficed to build a hundr bateaux , and with such a spitting over our left shoulders that t river would have risen still more . We had gone only two miles or so when we came to a narr place in the river with a smooth surge of water flowing very raP353idly over what looked like a gentle fall . Later I learned from Natanis that this is called Shadagee Falls , and that we were a matter of an hour 's paddle from the Chain of Ponds , which are the round buttons on the tail of the twisted folds we had been following  --  the buttons that are wedged among the boulders of the Height of Land itself . At ordinary times there is a drop of four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of water in the river , the drop appeared to us much less , and not difficult to pass either in canoes or bateaux ; nor would it have been , I think , if all of the bateaux had carried paddles as well as setting poles . We watched the first few bateaux , manned by riflemen with paddles , pass up over it , and by working until their muscles must have near split with agony , they got over without accident . Then Hobomok and I went up , and the colonel and Oswald , and some other bateaux ; but before we could continue onward we heard a great angry shout from below us , a despairing yell , so that Hobomok whirled the canoe and we shot back over the falls . Three bateaux had gone up abreast , their crews using only settingpoles , and laboring frantically ; but all together the three of them had reached spots where their poles found no hold . Immediatelythe herds of the bateaux fell off and the force of the streamrove their gunwales under water , whereupon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole craft beneath the surface . As the overturned boats surged downstream the bateaux behind them strove to escape them , four more of them turning roadside in the effort . No sooner had they done so than they , were seized and drawn clown by the violent river ; and in aanent their precious contents were torn loose and sucked into e raging brown flood  --  muskets , powder , flour barrels , porkrrels , and salt . While we were dragging out the crews the colonel came back to with the set smile and hurt eyes that I have once or twice seen the faces of men who were fighting stronger men with their ts , but would never stop until they were killed , no matter how atly they might be battered . " We camp here , gentlemen , for a council of war , " I heard him to two of his officers , " so that we can decide how to live with-t any food at all . "  |p354I  HAVE often puzzled over what makes the difference between a brave man and a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will always puzzle me . Indeed , I have come to a point where I dislike to say that this man is a brave man and that man is a coward , becauseoften a man will do a cowardly thing that requires more courage in the doing than would have been required to do a brave thing ; and there are many men who have done brave things because they were afraid to do the cowardly things that they would have preferred to do . Also there are some men who are cowards about fighting but heroes over money , and some who are brave beforeaudiences but cowardly alone , and some who are brave alone but cowardly before audiences , and some who are deadly afeared of sickness but contemptuous of a storm at sea , and so on , to an infinity of examples . Therefore , when I have thought about these things for a little time , my brain is in a complete muddle ; and I have arrived at no conclusion , ever , save that every man , somewhere , has in him the spark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to read ; and if means can ever be found to teach bravery as reading is taught , all men can be as brave as other men , and nobody will be the better for it . At the council of war that night there was no man , Oswald told me , who voted for returning . Arnold , he said , spoke to theca and told them that the provisions were reduced to no more than would feed a dozen healthy crows , but that men could keep breath . in their bodies for many days by eating those things that heaven might provide . " I can send to Enos for all he can spare , " he said , " and das ahead myself to the French settlements so that I can send bac food to the rest of you . All that can happen to us has happened God knows , and anything that happens after this can not help . but be a lesser evil than what we have already experienced . " At this Morgan , unshaven and red-eyed , his huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratched and whim  |p355Wove  his leggins from his bull-like charges across the carrying places in his Indian dress , glowered around the circle of officers . lid roared in his hoarse carter 's voice : " Go on , for God 's sake ! We can feed on hope for a week ! " It seems to me , " said Arnold , " that we may count onsome- king solider than that ; for even if all our food should be gone , we can not help but find some nutriment in these forests and in all lie waters that we must cross ; and I say that I believe that we should have a shot at it ; for if we are successful it will be a greatat of arms , one that will be told by fathers to their children for i thousand years to come . " More than that , His Excellency General Washington has put his trust in us , and I for one will not go home like a little child , moaning that I could not go where I was sent because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officers , and Captain Dearborn , I who became an ambassador afterward to some country in Europe  --  and a very horrid sight he was , Captain Oswald said , with tangled black whiskers that could scarce be told from the coat of the curly-haired black dog he held between his knees , andface as white as a clam-shell from some sickness that was gnawingat him  --  spoke up to the colonel very softly and said : " Sir , I correctly gather the sense of this council , these gentlemen are for Quebec , even if they have to eat their breeches to get there . " You gathered correctly , " said Colonel Meigs , whose first name , as I have said before , was Return , so that it was the fashion to shout , " Whoa ! Whoa ! " at the men of his division , " but from he looks of my breeches , I shall have nothing to eat after the firstten minutes . " " There is one more thing , " said Arnold , after he had thanked can . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all those whom we can not depend . We must send back the sick , cerinly ; but I am also in favor of sending back any man who is flint-hearted about continuing . " " I have some sick , " growled Morgan , " but there are no faint its among my men . If there were , and I found it out , I 'd take m by the slack of their breeches and throw them all the way across the Height of Land ! " This , however , was the course they agreed on ; and late that night Oswald summoned me to the colonel 's tent . He was writing , as he ever was when he was alone at night ; and he stabbed his pen at me over the top of his little field desk when I came in . " Now comes the reward of virtue , " he said , smiling the smile that it seemed to me no man could see without a warming of the heart . " Back you go to a land flowing with milk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself into a sickness . " " My stomach has shrunk , " I said , " and I do not need the food that I needed a month ago . " " All the more reason to beware when you find yourself among the flesh pots , " he said . Then he picked up two letters . " Here , " he added , " are messages for Colonel Enos and Colonel Greene . Greene has been waiting for Enos to come up to him with the reserves of food ; so you will find them near together . This mattersis important and brooks no delay , for there are some of us who are going to be in desperate need of food , and in no very great length of time , either . Listen to this , now , in case you lose it . " With that he read me the letter to Colonel Enos , which was dated , " Dead River , thirty miles from Chaudiere Pond , " the latter being the lake that my father and I have always spoken of as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter , after mentioning the extreme rains and floods , when it was thought best and ordered to send back all the sick and feeble with three days ' provisions , and directions for you to furnish them until they can reach the commissaryor Norridgewock ; and that on receipt of this you should procee with as many of the best of your division as you can furnish wit ! fifteen days ' provisions ; and that the remainder whether sick or wel should be immediately sent back to the commissary to whom I wrottotake all possible care of them . I make no doubt you will join wit me in this matter as it may be the means of preserving the whole de tachment , and of executing our plan without running any grea hazard , as fifteen days will doubtless bring us to Canada . I make n doubt you will make all possible expedition . " I will start at dawn , " I said , " and be as far as Colonel Greene ' division by night . " " Tell them to hurry , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his camp stool to drive with his fist as though he wer hitting at somebody . " Hurry , hurry , hurry ! We 've been a moat in the coils of this river , and a third of the distance still to go . IP357we could have hurried we 'd have walked through the unguarded gates of Quebec by now . Get at it , and hurry ; and hurry back with the news of how many are coming up ! " * * =kNatanis crawled into our lean-to that night and lay with us , the air being bitter cold with a feel of snow in it ; and because he was a better hand with a paddle than either Hobomok or myself , T determined to take him with us for speed and safety , both in goingand returning . This , I felt , I could safely do because there was none in the army who knew his face save Eneas and Sabatis ; and the two of them had gone to Quebec with messages from Arundel . In the gray of the dawn , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that we could pick him tip where there was none to see ; and Hobomok and I loaded our canoe into the water . Before we got away they had begun to bring the sick men down to the bateaux , so they could be sent back : men so weak from the flux that they could not walk , but must be dragged to the river side , and men so swollen and lamed from rheumatism that the sweat poured out of them in the biting morning air when they were picked up and carried . There was one man , a Pennsylvaniarifleman , a tall man with the bones near sticking through his skin from the flux , who made such an uproar on being dragged along that men came from all over the encampment to see what might be afoot . " Leave be ! " he called out , in a voice as shrill as a woman 's rom rage and weakness , " leave be ! I ai n't going back ! There ai n't ( ) thing wrong with me that a day wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye ! " Yet he was so weak that he could not struggle with hose who dragged him . " There 's sicker men than I be ! " he limited to all of us , " hiding and pretending to be well ! I ai n't ) ing back ! Leave me lay in the woods alone , and I 'll catch up ! " Daniel Morgan , hearing the commotion , came striding down ruing the ragged , bearded riflemen and looked into the face of he sick man . " Stand him up on his feet , " he said to the men who had him tiler the arms . They lifted him up until his feet were flat on the ground , andP358then released their holds . Thereupon he slumped down as though he were an empty pair of breeches and lay in a heap , making a little panting noise , like a tired dog . " Put him in the bateau , " said Morgan . He glanced at the riflemen , glowering at their impassive stares . " Do n't any of the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's an order ! You men keel ) well long enough , and England wo n't know whether she 's standing on her head or her fat behind ! " There may have been twenty to twenty-five sick men in all , not more ; and when I looked for James Dunn among them I could not find him , nor could I say to myself whether I was fearful of seeinghim or hopeful of doing so . At the second bend below we picked up Natanis , who took the stern paddle while Hobomok moved to the bow ; and thus driven we went down on the flooded waters faster than I had traveled in a canoe , ever . We were even spared the labor of carrying around many of the falls ; for Natanis had the ability that is possessed by the most skillful of the Abenakis of shooting a canoe over a four- or even a six-foot drop so that it comes down with no great force and is thus in no danger of breaking . How this is done I do not know ; but on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his paddle behind him into the water of the fall as the canoe shot over it , and by pressing clown on the water held the canoe in the air by main strength . On both sides of the stream , as we went down , were sad remindersof the great flood that had overwhelmed us  --  tent canvasescaught against tree trunks and draggling mournfully in the current ; tangles of setting poles and ropes jammed into the tops of bushes ; boards of bateaux that had broken apart on the falls , and entire bateaux lying in shallows along the shore ; chunks of salt pork turning slowly in the eddies at the base of rocks ; and bursted barrels dipping and swinging among the half-submerged trees . By noon we came up with Greene 's division , camped a few miles below the spot where the flood had hit us . Sending Natanis and Hobomok down the stream , thus to take no chance at all o any harm to Natanis , I went in search of Greene and found him with his officers , Major Bigelow , Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all talking about food ; and I havep359found it to be true that when there is a shortage of provisions folk will talk about nothing but food , nor ever weary of the subject . Colonel Greene tore open the message quickly , signing for me to wait , then read the message aloud to the others . Then he asked me in his gentle voice , a voice that seemed abashed at its boldness in asking questions of anyone , how the flood had been with us , and what was the state of our food . Those who served under Colonel Greene esteemed him highly , for he was very gentle , always , and thoughtful of those with him , and feared nothing , ever more eager to know what other folk were thinking than to air his own thoughts ; yet there were times when all of us would have been better pleased if he had raged and roared , like Morganfor in armies , in time of war , the noisy man is listened to first , and then the quiet man ; and since wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability of quiet men to be recognized , or for their voices to be heard above the bellowing of incompetents . I told him how the flood had near drowned us , and how the officersand men were set on going to Quebec , even though they must eat their breeches . At this Greene smiled gently , as though someone had said to him that the morrow would doubtless be pleasant ; but Captain Thayer , who was a maker of perukes before he came within a whisker 's width of losing his life at Fort William Henry , and the most harmless-seeming daredevil that ever was , said mildly that he approved of the sentiment so long as everyone ate his own breeches. 1 . asked them where I should find Colonel Enos , at which they booked at each other with the look that men have when they hold someone in disregard , but feel a reluctance to speak their minds before a stranger . " Broadly speaking , " said Major Bigelow , giving me the faintest uspicion of a wink , " you will find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " murmured Captain Thayer , " he is the earNo , no , no , " said Major Bigelow genially , " he must stay here he can watch the provisions and make sure that nobody ever enough to give away . " " Gentlemen ! Gentlemen ! " protested Colonel Greene , as thoughp360a little frightened at his temerity . Then to me , while I was still puzzling over Bigelow 's cryptic speech , he added : " I think you will find the colonel on the river a little below us , and it might be well if he had Colonel Arnold 's message at the earliest possible moment . We have heard that some of the colonel 's men are "  --  and here the colonel cleared his throat apologetically  --  " slightly disaffected . " " I have heard , " said Major Bigelow carelessly , " that they are damned well scared , and that whenever a leaf falls off a tree near one of them , he jumps like a doe that has backed into a thorn hush . " " Would you be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell Colonel Enos , if he asks for us , that we will wait for him to come up with provisions . ' Major Bigelow and Captain Thayer burst into an indecorous laugh at this , and Colonel Greene wagged his head at them in mild reproof . Misliking these tidings concerning Colonel Enos , I was on my way back to the river when I was stopped by young Mr. Burr , very ragged as to shoes and breeches , but cleanly shaved , and with his dapper appearance somehow preserved . " Here 's luck ! " he exclaimed . " What is happening up ahead ? Do they have food up there ? " " Mighty little , " I said . " Probably less than you since the flood . " " Less than we ! " he exclaimed , " That 's beautiful ! That 's wonderful ! At last we have something that is smaller than nothing ! " " What are you talking about ? " I said . " Why , bless your soul , " said Burr , " about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacataqua shoots for me ; and that I must share with my friends . Food ? Why , we 've been on starvationrations since the flood , and to-day I saw some men cutting two tallow candles into their gruel to give it body . " " But Enos was ordered to send up his surplus food to you ! " I protested . " Enos ! " said Burr , with a look in his eyes as malevolent a that of a hawk when he holds a mouse in his claws . " Enos ! Rot him and rat him ! He said he had none for himself , and would gi us only two barrels of flour ! Two barrels of flour to carry tw hundred men to Quebec ! Why , he might as well have offeredp361three sugar plums and an apple core ! " And with this Master Burr went to calling Colonel Enos names that would have turned the stomach of his reverend father who , I had been told , was the president of Princeton College in New Jersey . " But what became of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to cover our retreat ! " Burr laughed unpleasantly . " I think he still has it , " he said . " Else why do his men hang behind , never coming up with us , unless they fear that we will take supplies from them by main strength when we see how much they have , which we would do , God knows . " I went to the river and signaled to Natanis and Hobomok . " Look here , " said Burr , who had followed me , " is there any talk up ahead of turning back ? " " Yes , " I said , " there 's talk of it ; but the talk is that anyone who turns back is of less worth than a roach ; for roaches do n't mind water . " Burr smiled at me delightedly and clapped me on the back . Then he caught sight of Natanis bringing the canoe to the bank . " Ho ! " said he , " there 's a new face ! Who might your new Indian be ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can call him Mr. Pitt . " " Indeed , " said Burr , " I 'll call him Mr. Pitt if he 'll go down and pick up a few of the barrels of flour that Enos , rot him , is hiding from us ! " " I 'll be back , " I told him as we pushed into the stream , " with Enos , " and I left him cursing the gentleman very bitterly . We met Enos moving slowly upstream , as though he had a year for the making of the journey ; and far behind him two bateaux had straggled into sight around a bend . As I watched Enos coming up toward us I could see that the bow paddle was in the hands of John Treeworgy , for he had been so heavily on my mind that I could recognize his long , gray , gloweringface as far as I could see it . An Indian paddled stern : one I could not recognize at the moment . While I puzzled over him , Hobomok flung me the information over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who traveled to Cambridge with ' , ml Higgins : the one you bearded at Cobosseecontee. "  | " Does this man know you ? " I asked Natanis , not wishing to lead him into trouble . " I have never seen him before , " said Natanis . So we kept on , but I took no pleasure in seeing Swashan with Treeworgy , or the two of them together with Enos ; for I could feel in my bones that there was something wrong about Treeworgy . I had my suspicionsof Swashan as well ; and I would have liked to put both of them out of the way . Yet I could not go up to them and shoot them in cold blood , no matter what my suspicions might be ; for even in war times it is murder to kill a man unless you can prove that he is an enemy . Colonel Enos , I saw , had lost none of his weight and none of his importance since I had last seen him at Colburn 's shipyard so I was as full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with him , Natanis swung our canoe alongside of his . " Colonel Arnold 's compliments and a letter , " I said , handing the letter to him and keeping tight hold of his gunwale to see as much of Treeworgy as I could . So far as I could tell , Treeworgy took no interest in any of us after his first glum nod at me . As the colonel read the letter , he continually scratched at hi knees and made a sucking sound against the roof of his moat with his tongue , showing clearly that his thoughts did not plea him . Also he read it three or four times from beginning to end then folded it and put it slowly in his pocket ; then drew it o very quickly and read it again , holding his forehead in his hail " Well ! " he said . " Well ! " and fell to scratching himself again , h forehead all wrinkled . At length he looked up at me , puzzled-like . " How do the m feel up ahead ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan 's in and Meigs 's men ? " " Yes , sir , " I said , " even the sick men , who are being se back . " " Gah ! " he said , making a noise in his throat , such a noise as cleanly housewife makes when she sees a kitchen in a mess , " Gah ! These sick men ! If I could be rid of these sick men , I might something ! Sick men ! Sick men ! Sick men ! All to be looked a f t and fed like a lot of yowling babies ! " He opened the letter and read it again . " How do Arnold a Morgan and Meigs have provisions for fifteen days , " he ask " when all that I have heard from them is that they want ftP363from me ? Food ! Food ! Food ! Do n't they ever do anything but (  --  , it ? " " Sir , " I said , " I do not know exactly about these things , beyond what the colonel writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ! Ile flood and overturned bateaux , so that they are on half rations ; I hilt they would go on if they had no rations at all . " " Morgan and Meigs and the colonel are better officers than to permit such a thing as that , " he said , very pompously . " The first duty of an officer is to his men . " I thought of the tales I had heard of General Braddock at the Cnongahela in the last war , and how he had beaten our men with tile flat of his sword to make them come from behind their trees and stand in line like good British soldiers , to be shot to shreds by the hidden French and Indians ; and there also came into my mind the many times I had heard my father say that the first duty it most of the British officers that were sent to America had .11 ways been to themselves ; but since I was facing a soldier who believed in discipline , I said nothing . " I have no such provisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My men have barely three days ' provisions left ; and it is common knowledge among them that after they have advanced another day 's march into this howling wilderness theyill starve to death if they try to go forward and starve to death f they try to go back . " " It is thought among those ahead , " I said , in no way wishful of rguing with a colonel , " that since Colonel Enos 's division had ( ) re provisions at the start than the other three , it would still have more provisions instead of less . " " It is n't true ! " he shouted , hammering his hand against the noe thwart . " We are near to starvation ourselves ! We have t flour in the flood and the rapids and the damned leaky baux , " he said defensively , " and we have fed the sick and given stir to Greene 's division . " I have been told , " I said , meaning to be sarcastic , " that Greene 's division has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Enos petulantly , seeing no sarcasm in it , " and now in told to send on as many men as I can supply with fifteen s ' provisions and send the rest back ! How in God 's name can n two things at once when I have not the means to do either ! " I gave him the message that Greene had given me for him  --   | that he was waiting for provisions ; whereat Enos made his housewifelynoise in his throat , " Gah ! " and prodded Treeworgy in the shoulder . " We 'll go ashore , " he said , " and you can go back and tell Captain Williams and Captain McCobb and the rest of the officers to hurry up here . I want to talk to them . I want you , too , " he added to me . " There may be some questions you 'll have to answer . " He strode up and down on the bank , rumbling to himself and frequently making sucking sounds against the roof of his mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natanis told us while we waited , was good hunting country ; and not far from us , on the west side of Dead River , there was a wide brook ending in two ponds ; and in the ponds and the brooks leading to them the beavers were thick . On this brook , he said , he had a burying place , as well as on the next stream above , where I had met him after he had directed the foot-soldiers back to their proper path , and on the fourth pond of the Chain of Ponds and the first pond on the far side of the Height of Land . " A burying place for what ? " I asked . " For beavers ? " Both Natanis and Hobomok laughed at this , and reminded me ( of what I had forgotten , if I had ever known it : that spare canoe ' are often buried in the winter by all of the Northern Indians for safety and preservation , and that a diligent Indian in a rougcountry , where there are many falls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory , buried in the win ter and some laid up and carefully covered with branches in th-e summer . When the bateaux of Colonel Enos 's division came up I sett Natanis and Hobomok away again , telling them to get game i possible , but for one of them to keep his eye on me in case I wished . to move . The appearance of the bateaumen was not what I ha . expected ; for they seemed no better fed than the men at the front nor were their jackets or shirts or breeches less torn and stained though their paths had been smoothed for them by the van of the army . Likewise , there was a slow surliness about them that madly them seem more wretched than any of the men I had seen in the other three divisions.  |p365Two  of them came over to me at once , Connecticut men , to ask whether I had come from up front . When I said that I had , one of them asked when the front divisions were starting back . " Why , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting back ? " " Everybody says they 're starving to death up there , " he said , " and everybody says we 'll starve to death ourselves if we go beyondhere . They ca n't go on ! They 've got to come back . " " I have n't heard anybody saying that , " I said . " Probably it 's some crazy man you heard : some man that never left his mother before . Some cry-baby , probably . " " No , " the bateauman said , " all the sick men from Morgan 's division are saying it . " " Did they tell you ? " I asked . " No , " he said , " but Treeworgy was talking with them and they told him . " Well , I thought , there it was , what I had been sure of at Fort Western : Treeworgy spreading fearsome tales " I 'll bet they did n't tell him the worst of it , though , " I said , hoping that they would tell me a little more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They told how the officershave to whip the men with whips to git ' em to carry their bateaux over the bad spots , so 's their backs are all bloody . " " Well , well ! " I said . " Yes , " said the other bateauman , " and how the water beyond here is poisoned by the rains so that them as drinks it are all swoll up , so they ca n't walk . " " Is everybody swoll up ? " the first bateauman asked me . " You gosh-blamed idiots ! " I said , " do I look swoll up ? " " No ; that 's what Treeworgy said , " growled the first bateauman . " What was it he said ? " I asked . " Why , " said the first bateauman , " that they 'd be sending back somebody that was n't swoll up , to say that everything was all right , and git our food away from us . " " There ai n't going to be nobody get any more of my food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , nor me neither , " said the first . The two guffawed . " Anybody that gits any more food out of any of us , " said the second , " will have to git our muskets away from us fust. "  | I turned to look at Enos , who stood at the edge of the bank , pinching his lower lip and staring down the river . " The damned old woman ! " said the first bateauman , following my glance . " Yes , " said the second , " he 's been a-giving away enough provisionsto fellers that say they 're sick . To hell with him and to hell with them ! If we do n't look out for ourselves , nobody will ! " " Well , " I said , " they do n't feel that way up front . They 'd rather die than give up . " The first bateauman snorted . " What 's the good of that ? " he said . " It 's like Treeworgy was saying : if it 's sure death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use to his country if he do n't go there . " Rain had begun to fall again , a cold drizzle that would , I could feel , change to snow in a little time . " Look at this ! " said the second bateauman . " Look at this stinkingcountry ! Look at those damned mountains ! I go no further ! " I heard Enos calling me ; and , near sickened by their talk , I left the bateaumen and went to him . Other bateaux had come up , and some of the officers of the Fourth Division  --  Williams and Scott and McCobb , all of them captains , and Lieutenant Hyde and LieutenantPeters . A fire had been lit for them and a tent pitched , very fine , whereas I doubt whether there was a single tent left in all of Morgan 's and Meigs 's divisions . They sat disconsolate in the tent , looking out at the rain ; and I marveled how it was possible for men of the same height and size and muscle and upbringingto be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan 's and Meigs 's and Greene 's divisions in their minds ; for whereas the minds of Morgan 's and Meigs 's and Greene 's officers worked quickly , seizing on favorable and happy things , these men 's minds worked slowly and moved little , like a cow stamping her foot and quivering the skin over her shoulder to drive away flies on a hot afternoon : they saw no ray of light or hope in anything at all . " The letter , " said Colonel Enos as I came up , " was brought by this man . " They glowered at me , all of them , for a time . At length CaptainScott , a heavy-paunched man with a thin face and a very red noseon which a drop of moisture hung persistently , asked me gloomilywhether I knew the country that lay between us and Quebec . I said that I knew it from hearsay only , whereupon Captainp367Scott asked me to tell him truthfully whether I would undertake to travel this route with an insufficiency of provisions . " Why , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go there I would travel it was a handful of salt and a lump of salt pork to cook with my trouts . " " That is quibbling , " said Colonel Enos pompously , " and I detestquibbling . Answer us truthfully , now : if you had provisions for only a few days , and could get no more , would you be willing to make the journey to Quebec from here , especially if it was your duty to conduct others who looked to you for their safety ? " " Sir , " I said , " you are a colonel , and I have no rank at all in this army , save that of guide , which is a title that I did not seek . I f I should speak out to you as I would speak out to any acquaintance , my words may be held against me , or I may be accused of disrespect . I know little about the ways of an army , and some of them seem to me to be thought out by a lunatic . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Colonel Enos , " and provide us with the information we are seeking . " " Well , then , " I said , " you have asked me a question that is unfair , because there are two ways of going to Quebec : one in wartimeand one in peace-time . " " Now you are quibbling again , " said the colonel . " Sir , " I said , " I am not quibbling . I would go to Quebec in war-t ime with no provisions at all , so long as there was another man left on the road to go with me . " " Let us get at this another way , " said Captain Williams , a pleasant , polite man . " Do you know the instructions in Colonel Arnold 's letter ? " " Yes , " I said , " he ordered Colonel Enos to send forward all the men to whom he could give fifteen days ' rations , and to send home all the others , both sick and well . " " That is correct , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you would do about going to Quebec in such a case as this if von could only send forward thirty men with fifteen days ' provisions , and if the rest of your men , three hundred and more , would have to be sent back along the homeward road with no provisions of any sort  --  sent back to struggle through these forests and bogs rind keep up their strength for a week and mayhap two weeks with nothing at all to eat . " " Now you are asking me about an impossibility , " I said.  | " Not at all , sir ; not at all ! " said Colonel Enos , puffing himself out like a pigeon pursuing a mate . " That is our situation exactly ! Tell us what you would do in such a situation ? " " Well , " I said slowly , " I think I would put all my provisions in one place and count them , so that I might see where I had made such a mistake . " " Just what do you mean by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , " I said , " I mean that there is no doubt in my mind that you have more provisions than you think you have . " " Drat you ! " the colonel began , going purple with rage ; but Captain Williams stopped him . " We invited it , Colonel , " he said . Then he spoke to me again , very politely . " We would like you to see this as something apart from your personal desires . In addition to our own men , who have become discontented and sullen from hearing the tales of sick men and stragglers from other divisions , and from doing all the dirty work of the three leading divisions , we are obliged to supportall the sick men who have been sent to us by Morgan and Meigs and Greene . I suppose you think it is our duty to let these sick men starve in the wilderness ? " " No , " I said , " I do not . " " Then , " said Captain Williams , " you think it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the settlements , because without the provisions they would certainly starve to death ? " " Yes , " I said , " I do . " " Then if you think that is our duty , " said Captain Williams , " you must think it is our duty to return home with the entire divi-sion . " " Oh , for God 's sake ! " I exclaimed in disgust , " I think nothing of the sort ! " " But we can not do two things ! " Captain Williams protested . " We can not send the sick home , and go forward at the same time ; and you say yourself that it is our duty to send home the sick with provisions . As soon as we do that we can not give anyoneenough provisions for fifteen days , and Colonel Arnold has ordered us to send forward only such men as we can supply with provisions for fifteen days . Therefore it seems to me that you think it is our duty to return home . " " That would be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rage , " if you had as few provisions as you say you have . "  | " Well , do you think we are better judges of that , or you ? " asked Captain Williams very sweetly , while Colonel Enos fumed and blew out his lips . " I think I would be , " I said . " if I could be permitted to go back and count your provisions without getting a bullet through the head from one of your brave-hearted boys . " " We could not think of exposing you to danger , " said Captain Williams . with as sweet and kindly a smile as ever I saw . " No , " I said , " and good reason , too , if you want to talk that way , because it seems that you can not think of exposing anyone to danger , including yourselves . " Now I was sorry for this as soon as I had said it , and I have often waked up at night regretting it ; but being in a rage at having been talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at having had words put in my mouth , I was not content to stop there , but made a speech that I had occasion to regret still more . " Here is another thing that I think , " I said . " I think that if I were in your place , and thought as you think , I would pack up my bateaux even though I had provisions for a thousand men for fifteen clays , and run off home with them , leaving the heartbreakarid fighting for folk who do not live by measurement , and are willing to trust to God or their own efforts to have breeches on their legs and shoes on their feet and air in their lungs and food in their bellies in a week 's time . " With this I got up and walked out of the tent , hot with anger and expecting every moment to get a bullet or a fist in the back of the head . Natanis and Hobomok were holding to a tree across the river , and drove their canoe for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I climbed in , too disquieted to rejoice at the two raccoonsand the bundle of fat spruce partridges that lay in the bottom , I heard the colonel 's voice behind me . " Tell Colonel Greene , " he said , " to wait for me in the morning . I will hold a council of war when I come up with him . " In his voice I sensed a number of unspoken words  --  words that if spoken would have made me wishful , I felt sure , of pickingup one of the partridges and jamming it down his throat. * * * The rain turned to snow as we went up to Greene 's camp in the semi-dark  --  a gurry of weather through which we could scarce see to pick our way around the falls , nor could we have done so without Natanis to lead the way . Nor could I hold my feet properly , my mind being ever on the lack of provisions of which Enos and his men complained . I did not believe that their food was as low as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being in my thoughts then and now that the men , affrighted out of all reason by Treeworgy 's fearsome tales , had hid provisions so that they might run home , uncovering the hidden food on the way . Yet if there was any truth in it , Enos and his officers were indeed in a parlous situation ; for if they went on , leaving numbersof sick men to suffer and starve , they would be damned for cruelty by all who heard of it ; and if they went back , leaving the rest of the army to go on without them , they would be equally damned for cowardice . Also there rested heavy on me the knowledge that Treeworgy from the first had sown discontent among Enos 's men , and that I , suspecting it , had failed to get at the bottom of the matter . Nor was it , I thought , any great comfort to know that if Enos 's division turned back Treeworgy would turn back with them . It was dark by the time we saw Greene 's campfires through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame of mind , what with my anger and the bite of the snow on my body and the burningof my feet from tramping over the carries in shoes that were broken in a dozen place , so that I might as well have been walking in my bare feet . But when I left Natanis and Hobomok kindling a fire in the lee of our canoe and went with one of the raccoons and some of the partridges to Greene 's tent to give him Enos 's message , the welcomethat I got was as good as warm clothes on my body and an opened window in my head to let out the darkness and gloom that had filled me at Enos 's camp . I make no doubt that it is a fine thing to be serious-minded , preservinga dignified and ponderous demeanor toward life ; but if I must fight or march I wish to fight and march with frivolous , light-minded folk ; for they are the ones who fight and march while the others are giving serious thought to how it should be done . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Greene , feeling of thep371raccoon absent-mindedly and passing it to Major Bigelow , who cuddled it in his arms as though it had been a child , " I am very sorry to hear these tales about Enos 's division , though it is no more than I expected . I am sure the colonel will do what is best . " Bigelow , a smallish , brown-faced boy with heavy black eyebrowsand a peculiar habit of breaking out into imitation peals of laughter at moments when laughter seemed little called for , had placed the raccoon 's body on his knees and was parting its hair carefully at various spots . Suddenly he burst into a shrill whistling , pointing with apparent horror at the parted hair of the raccoon . When we quickly gathered near to look we saw a large black flea moving languidly against the white skin . " Colonel Enos ! " said Bigelow gravely . " Moves a little fast , does n't he ? " asked Captain Thayer . " Yes , " said Bigelow . " He 's going south . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Captain Topham . " If he does n't , and we take Quebec , we 'll have to stay there for twenty years waiting for him to catch up with us . " " Gentlemen ! Gentlemen ! " protested Colonel Greene . " Gentlemen hell ! " said Bigelow , going to the rear of the leantoand whistling violently through his teeth at the cook , who was working over a kettle under a pine tree . " Put this in the gruel , Luke , " he shouted , tossing the raccoon to him , " and see if you can get it strong enough to hold up a hair . " He burst into a peal of false , forced laughter , at which the colonel snickered gently , looking sheepishly at us as he did so , as if wishful of apologizing for his levity . " Gentlemen hell ! " resumed Major Bigelow . " He 's an old woman and you know it , Colonel ! Do n't be so easy on him ! I f he was a hen , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see whether the egg was really there . If I can get him behind a pine tree with nobody looking I 'll kick him all the way back to Norridgewock . Do n't say Gentlemen to me ! I 'm nothing but a carter where Enos is concerned I " It may be , " said the colonel , " that he is out of provisions , as he says . If this is true I do not envy him , with all our sick on his hands . " " Stuff and feathers ! " said Thayer . " How can he be out of provisions when he started with twice what any of us carried ! " " What do you think ? " the Colonel asked me.  | " Sir , " I said , " I do not know . I was in a rage at him and Williamsand McCohb , thinking that they were shameful cowards ; but the men are frightened and sulky , wishful of saving their own skins and be damned to Enos and everybody else . It may he that they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost more than we through spiritless handling of their bateaux , and hid much to boot , unknown to Enos and the rest . " " Oh , for God 's sake ! " cried Bigelow angrily , " he could chance it with a few of his men , could n't he ? Do you think we 'll turn back if we have less than fifteen days ' provisions , such as the colonel tells us to have in his letter ? " He struck an attitude , very pompous . " I shall go forward , " he said , " even though I have provisionsfor only fourteen and one half days ! " Again he burst into a peal of shrill , false laughter ; and the rest of us laughed at his clowning , knowing well that he would go forward with the colonel and the rest of the division , even though there was only one day 's provisions to carry them over the mountains and down the Chaudiere . I make no pretense of reading men 's minds , since I have found so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad , and sad when there seems to be fair cause for cheerfulness . Yet if Colonel Enos was dispirited and uncertain in mind when 1 gave him the message from Colonel Arnold , he had more reason for being so on the following morning . There was a blanket of snow on the ground when we awoke ; and the air had an edge to it that took us in the knees and behind the ears , very piercing and discomfortable . It may be that I speak overmuch of the biting nature of the cold along the Kennebec ; but I do so because it was one of the enemies we fought , as well as the British , and because it seemed to me a peculiar racking cold that slid down from the Height of Land , creeping and twisting along the winding coils of the river , undulating in a sort of clammy mist that clung to the valley through its whole length . Then there were the sick men coming clown on him , bateau after bateau filled with them , more than twenty-five men from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Greene 's division , men so weakened with the flux that they could scarce stand , and so racked with the rheumatism that if they fell , which they often did when they were out of the bateaux , they mustp373either lie where they fell or drag themselves along on their hands and knees until someone came to lift them up . Greene sent off his division as soon as it was light , staying behindhimself with Bigelow and the other officers to wait for Enos and the council of war . " Wait , " he said to me , " until the council is over , and I will give you a message for the colonel . " I watched the men set off , saying little as they churned the new snow into slush . There were barely a hundred of them , all very badly off in the matter of clothes , and two of them with no shoes at all , though I make no doubt that their feet were as tough as bather ; and indeed I had as lief gone barefoot myself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught Master Burr on the run and asked him the whereaboutsof Jacataqua . " Gone ahead to hunt , " he flung at me over his shoulder . " Send your Mr. Pitt to get food if there 's time . I could do with a juicy crow to-night ! " This I did , telling Natanis and Hobomok that they were safe in hunting for a matter of three hours , though it was a move that did me no good . Yet I can not rightly say that I regretted it ; for it has always seemed to me that if we regretted and sought to avoid all the small movements that lie behind all our great misfortunes and disappointments , we would spend our lives in regrets and our days in immovability . It was noon when Enos came up the river with his officers , Williams , McCobh , Scott , Hyde , and Peters ; and after all these years I can not set down their names , or that of Enos either , withoutthe desire to curse them , even though I know in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what they did . They were in a bateau , all of them , the bateau being driven by Treeworgy and Swashan ; and I knew when I saw it that they were going no farther ; for in the bateau there was no baggage and no provisions . They went at once to Colonel Greene 's tent , and after a time I went over myself and crouched as near to it as I could get , to hear , if possible , what might be going forward . Major Bigelow was speaking to them , as careless as though he spoke of how to scrape the barnacles off a sloop . " There is no use buffering and chuffering about what Colo- nel Arnold would have us do if we can not live up to the letter of his instructions , " he said , " because Colonel Arnold has gone beyondour reach . What the colonel has said is that he wants no sick men and no cowards , but he must have fighters ; so I am going on and my men are going with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change that ! " " But you 've got to figure , " said Colonel Enos , " that it takes us three days to cross the Height of Land and two more days to reach Lake Megantic and another three days " Begging the colonel 's pardon , " said Major Bigelow , " I have n't got to figure , and I 'm not going to . I 'm going to go , and not waste time figuring . " " That is what I am figuring on doing , " said Captain Thayer , very mild and pleasant . " But an officer is responsible for his men , " objected Colonel Enos , " and I must think of my men . " " Holy mackerel ! begging the colonel 's pardon , " said Bigelow . " What are you going to do if we have to ram our men against the guns of Quebec ; and we have n't any written guarantees from England that we wo n't have to . I hope we would n't be supposed to wrap ' em up in feather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's another matter entirely , " said Colonel Enos . " I have to think of my men . " So do I ! " said Bigelow . " I have to think of them , and of Colonel Arnold , and of the men in Morgan 's and Meigs 's divisions , and that 's why , I 'm going ! " " My men refuse to continue , " said Captain Williams . " So do mine , " said McCobb . " And mine , " said Scott . " Sir , " said Colonel Enos , seemingly speaking to Major Bigelow , " I protest against your manner of spitting when my officers have stated a fact calculated to enable us to arrive at a decision . It is an act unworthy of an officer and a gentleman ! " What reply Major Bigelow made to this remark I never learned ; for a hand touched me on the shoulder . It was Natanis . " Where is the canoe ? " he asked . " Our canoe ? " He nodded . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and food . " " Treeworgy ! " I said to him under my breath , and we ran togetherto the spot where we had camped . There was little need top375look at the tracks leading to the river to see that Treeworgy and Swashan had robbed us . From the marks on the bank we could see that they had gone upstream . " How far , " I asked Natanis. " to your laid-up canoe ? " " Ten times the flight of a partridge , " he said , " on the opposite bank . " This , I knew , was about a mile . " Quick , " I said , " get across with Greene 's bateau , you and Hobomok , and uncover it ! For ( ; od 's sake , hurry ! This Treeworgy is up to some deviltry or other . He is a spy and there can be no two ways about it ! " I recall no particular despair at our situation , despite our lack of food and blankets and the loss of my fine musket , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my sights , or my hands on his dirty , lying throat . I knew that both Hobomok and Natanis had their muskets , and carried fishing lines , flints , and steel in their pouches . For our living we could make shift in some way . But Treeworgy 's dash toward the front of the column was something on which I had not counted ; and there was a feeling in the pit of my stomach that it boded no good for me . I ran to Greene when he and Enos came out of the council , followed by the other officers . Enos went to bawling for Treeworgy ; and Bigelow and the rest of Greene 's officers went off toward their bateau without so much as a farewell look or glance toward Enos 's men . " Give my compliments to Colonel Arnold , " said Greene , with a look about his mouth as though he had eaten something hateful , " and tell him that my division , reduced to one hundred and seven effective men , will join him with the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may tell him . " " And the council of war ? " I asked . " That is a message I mislike sending , " he said mildly . " Colonel Enos 's officers voted against proceeding , on the ground that their provisions were insufficient and their men unruly . Colonel Enos voted with us to proceed , but yielded to the pleas of his officers and will return at the head of his division . " We looked at each other without speaking for a moment . " Is at all , sir ? " I asked . " Yes , I think that is all , " Colonel Greene sighed . " It is all very difficult and painful . He will have to stand a court-martial when e gets back , of course . "   " That should not be hard to stand , " I said , " with Williams and McCobb testifying for him , and no Bigelow or Thayer to distract him . " Colonel Greene nodded blandly , as though somewhat soothed by the thought , and motioned abruptly to Bigelow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , glancing at me quickly . I listened for a moment to the bawling of Colonel Enos for Treeworgy , and thought to myself that it was a good thing for him to stand there and bawl for a time . " Yes , sir , " I said . " My Indians have gone downstream , hoping to find another raccoon for the colonel . We will pass you within the hour . " Greene turned away , a very fine gentleman , but a little overkindlyand obliging , it seemed to me , for an army not officered exclusively by gentlemen , which our army was not , any more than was the British army . For an hour after that I hid in the pines near the camping ground , watching Enos fuming and fussing in the snow and occasionallywhooping for Treeworgy . At the end of that time Natanis and Hobomok came around the bend , driving a small canoe against the heavy current so that the water curled away from its stem , showing that it was well loaded . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blanket . They came up on the far side of the river : then , as I showed myself , cut across to me . Beside the blanketed hump lay a spare musket . " What in God 's name is all this ? " I asked . " Half a barrel of flour , " said Natanis , " that Mr. Pitt was asked to get . " I heard Colonel Enos bawling behind me , so climbed in " Here ! " he shouted , as we pushed upstream , " set me down to m ) camp ! " " Begging the colonel 's pardon , " I said , mindful of Major Bige low 's military forms , " but the colonel can go to hell . " He was still bawling furiously for Treeworgy when we ha , our last sight of him , nor did I care if I never had another . P377I HAVE , it seems to me , a fairish eye for beauty , and I have heard it said that there is great beauty to the Chain of Ponds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one higher than the other , and all of them giving rise to this river that had thrown its coils about us and battered us until we were bruised and lame . Yet I have never seen the beauty to them since we fought our way across them through the wind and snow of late October , so I think that there is more to beauty than swelling hills or tumbled rocks or limpid waters ; and I would not give one acre of my ragged sand dunes in Arundel for all the mountain ponds that you can find me in a week . Nor , for very good reasons , did I see the beauty of any of that torn and crumpled and rack-strewn country that lay between us and Canada , one of the reasons being that the snow stung our eyes so that for a part of the time we could see little save the trees about us , and another being that we made our way through such a smother of brush and branches and fallen logs and ledges that we were content to guard our eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third being that I long ago learned from Natanis that speed is gained and strength saved , in arduous marching or climbing , if the eye is fastened on the ground that lies before the feet , once the trail be known . Therefore I remember less of that country than I might have rememberedhad I gone into it to dawdle leisurely-like over the killingof moose or lynxes , with a full belly each night and morning , and stout shoes on my feet , and fires when I wanted them to drive he aching numbness out of my muscles and joints . The main Nape of it , none the less , I can remember and I shall always remember ; for I often see it in my dreams , when objects are swollen and distorted , unreachable and ungraspable . Vhat I see is a stupendous stone wall , such as we build in New England out of the ragged gray rocks with which our fields are lied . The stone wall , in my dreams , lies across a bog in which the  |p378hoof-|prints  of a million giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and from one side of the wall to the other side , from bog hole to bog hole , there runs a long and twisted stalk of woodbine , zigzagging here and there , up and down , in and out . Along the woodbine stalk , in my dreams , I see a throng of little red ants , groping and hesitating , fumbling here and there , straying and struggling , backing and filling , but ever moving onward . It is like this stone wall that the cruel , stone-toothed Height of Land rises out of the bogs of the North . To the south of it are the bogs of the Chain of Ponds , like vast hoof-prints in the mud of ages , from which all the waters run to the south . To the north of it are the bogs of Lake Megantic , from which all the waters flow to the north , forming the Chaudiere and the other streams that fall into the St. Lawrence . Our trail across it was like the tangled , twisted stalk of woodbine ; and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creeping feebly , but ever creeping forward . Eager as were Natanis and Hobomok and I to overtake Treeworgy , when we left Enos shouting into the whirling snowflakes , we were held back by the snow and the quickly gathering dusk . We passed Greene , and in time came up with Burr riding in a bateauwith his friend the chaplain , one Reverend Spring , a jovial young man from Princeton College , who was cursed with chilblains , an ailment that he was encouraged to conceal because of his heartening effect on the men , and his failure to hear and see mattersthat were better unheard and unseen by a chaplain . " Here , " I said , as we drew alongside of him , " Enos has gone back with his entire division , and here is some flour for you . " Burr broke into a flow of profanity at Enos that could have been achieved only by someone familiar with the Bible . " Amen , " said the Reverend Spring , feeling cautiously of his toes . " Anyway , " said Burr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " l am glad to see that Mr. Pitt did his duty . We give you our hearty thanks , Mr. Pitt . " He lifted his hat politely to Natanis , who grinned at him amiably . " How did they do it ? " he asked me . Natanis spoke to me rapidly in Abenaki . " Well , " I said , " I had been content not to know , fearing that there might have been some chicanery about it , but it seems that it was the merest chance . Mr. Pitt happened to be near some ofp379Enos 's men when a fearful screaming broke out in the forest , a most horrible screaming such as had never been heard before . The men 's attention was so caught by this that they must have dropped or overlooked the flour , as well as a musket and three blankets that we sorely needed . " " Oh , " said Burr profoundly , " that explains everything ! " " The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away , " said the ReverendSpring , huddling his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on as rapidly as we could , we got no farther than the falls at which the bateaux had been upset two days before . We were off at dawn the following morning ; and though the driving snow had ceased , we were hindered and blocked at the carriesby the bateaumen of Meigs 's division , who clambered with difficulty through the slippery slush , so that it was not until noon that we came to the first of the Chain of Ponds , all of them borderedby mountains that seemed to me to blanket us with chill and darkness . I could not breathe easily or deeply among them , ascan among the sweet salt marshes and the silvery , curving beaches of Arundel . Up the we went , crossing round ponds and oval ponds and ponds with points like fingers stretching out to catch at us , and ponds shaped like hourglasses strung together on a thread of a river that twisted and dwindled and hid in bogs and leaped out ats over ledges again : small ponds and medium ponds and large . ends until we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with e to this day . I have but one good thing to say of them , and that s this : if a man have a fondness for ponds and can not find a pond o suit him among them , he must be hard indeed to please . We came up to Morgan 's men , groping around the shores of he ponds for the route to pass from one to another ; but Natanis aided us through them as surely as a Falmouth man passes from is home to the wharves . At nightfall on the last Thursday in October , and again I remember the day because the next day fell n a Friday , we came to the last of the Chain of Ponds , the last and greatest , and crossed it with the granite , tree-clad wall of Height  --  I Land looming dark before us against the pale October sky . While Natanis and Hobomok cooked trouts and made cakes of flour I had taken from the half barrel , I went to those of Mor-P380gan 's men who were camped near us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had passed them at mid-afternoon . " Did they tell you about Enos ? " I asked . " Nay , " said a drawling Virginian , busy patching his breeches with a squirrel skin , " he went past us like a pig after a snake . " " What about Enos ? " asked another . I told them the tale again , while all of these tall men came around me and listened , chewing silently on sumach leaves or willow bark , and even forbearing to spit until I had finished . " Well , " said one of them when I had done , " I hope he rots away , a little at a time , starting now , or dies plenty . painful . " Therewith he embellished his speech with frills and trimmings that made Mr. Burr 's attempts , which I had so much admired , seem weak and sickly ; and there was a general chorus of deep , passionate cursing from the rest of the Virginians , so that there was nothing about Colonel Enos or his ancestors that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cursing is not what it was in my grandfather'sday , when it was considered , both by the damner and the damned , a serious business to damn a man for a fault or a sin whereas it is now the fashion to damn anything and everything , whether it deserves damning or not ; so that a man will damn a twig that slaps his cheek or a bird that twitters over-loudly when he is desirous of sleeping . This may all be so ; but I could ask to hear no more polished and intricate cursing than that which ColonelEnos received when the news of his retreat came among Morgan'smen ; and if there was no efficacy in it , then there never has been and never will be any efficacy in any sort of curse anywhere . At dawn of Friday , the last Friday in October , we set off to cross the Height of Land ; and while I had ever held Morgan 's riflemen in high esteem as gallant and indomitable soldiers , the thing that they did that day has set them , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever , since then , I have heard them bragging somewhat concerning their powers , which they are a little prone to do , I have made no protest at it , ever . Since the supplies of all divisions were reduced , by the time the Chain of Ponds were crossed , to a low state , the provisions being near gone and much of the ammunition being spoiled by the leakingof rain and river water into the powder kegs , Colonel Arnold had sent back an order that the few remaining bateaux could bep381left at the last of the Chain of Ponds , barring one bateau for each company for the carrying of medicines and a few essentials , so that the half-fed army might more rapidly cross the terrible five-mile wall of the Height of Land . Yet Morgan 's riflemen , angered by the return of Enos and determined to make rapid progress when they reached Canada , as well as to save the few military stores which they had so tenderly guarded , said that they would carry all of their remaining bateaux , seven of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , albeit in doing it there were some of them who wore t lie skin from their shoulders , so that it was necessary for them to cut away the garments from over the raw spots and support their packs by thongs around their heads and chests . When we passed some of these men , creeping slowly up the trail , dragging at the great heavy bateaux like ants tugging at something infinitely vaster than themselves , I thought to myself that Roger Enos 's excuse for returning might prove satisfactory to all the world , but that it could never be anything more than the whimpering of a frightened puppy to those who had gone on . Knowing that the trail which Morgan 's men were following had been made by Lieutenant Steele and Lieutenant Church and Cap II tiff and-the twenty axe-men , I feared to follow it too far lest . ne of them should have means of recognizing Natanis and so rake trouble for him , and also lest I be ambushed by Treeworgy , ho could not be far in advance . Therefore Natanis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track , like a deer path , and along his we struggled as well as though we were on the snagged trail , hough this , God knows , is not said in high praise . What hell maybe like , I do not know ; but if it is like the Height land I hope that I may be spared from it . I have seen many evil forests in my life ; but never have I seen so much that was evil - impressed into such a small compass as here . The trees were small , starved trees , never a first-growth tree tong them ; and all of them grew out of the rotting bones of her forests which had been beaten to the earth , Natanis said , byterrible windstorms that rage across them . Thus there were ow-downs everywhere , tangles of dead pines , with new growth ding them together , so that there was no getting through them . or . as one climbed higher on this terrible wall , did the moisture in from the earth , as might be expected ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through thickets whose dead twigs snapped into our faces : devilish bogs at the bottom of ravines , and sheer precipices rising out of bogs with other bogs at their tops . Along our narrow deer track , twisting around mire holes and skirting blow-downs , Natanis moved without hesitation , though it was a path I could never have followed by myself . When I said this to him he showed me the Abenaki trail marks , very faint ones so that they might not be used by the Montagnais or any other Northern Indians : triple slashes , little more than scratches at times , inclined to the left or to the right , or straight up and down , depending on the direction followed by the trail ahead . There were , he said , three main Abenaki trails across the Height of Land from the Chain of Ponds : one zigzagging across from the pond we had just left and coming out on Seven Mile Stream , which is the stream flowing from the northerly side of the Height of Land into Lake Megantic ; one going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easterly shore of Lake Megantic ; and the third going to the left and coming out on the westerly shore of the lake . These , he said , were necessary for hunting parties , and had existed for many years , with cross trails connecting them with each other . It was the first of these , he said , that we were traveling ; and the trail that had been opened for the army was a straighter trail , and shorter , than any of the Abenaki trails . After we had topped the Height and commenced our descent we came , of a sudden , to a mountain meadow , one that seemed to me a very lovely sight because of its resemblance to a fragment of our New England dropped into all this hellishness . There were clumps of elm trees in it , very large and stately , and oaks and ash trees , more like the common lands of such a town as Salem or Cambridge , and a great mat of wild grass over it . Seeing my delight , Natanis said that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evil country lay all behind us . The meadow , he said , was without a mate anywhere in all that country ; and from its beauty the Abenakis believed it to be the spot where the great lord Glooskap was born . Near its lower end , he said , flowed the Seven Mile Stream , which , after seven miles of winding , fell into Lake Megantic : but the country through which it flowed was worse than the Height of Land , thick with trackless bogs lyingp383deep in water , so that even the Abenakis shunned it , skirting around it on the high land to the east and west . Through this meadow ran a broad and noticeable trail , so that we knew that Church and Steele and his men , as well as Arnold himself , had passed this way into Seven Mile Stream and so into 1 Sake Megantic . Therefore we went beyond the meadow , watchingcarefully for Treeworgy , dropped our canoe into the twisted channel of the Seven Mile Stream , and slipped silently down it through the worst swamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all to the stream on its lower portions , only trees and shrubs standing deep in water , with here and there a little islet choked with brush . The trees and bushes ceased , of a sudden , toward dusk . Thus we knew that we had come to the lake . In the distance there was a plume of smoke , rising straight in the still cold air from the righthandshore ; and as we approached it we saw bateaux in the water , and made out five or six campfires , so that we were certain that we had come up with Colonel Arnold , which indeed we had . We skirted around the camp so that Natanis might land beyond it and lie safely on the bank until we had need of him , and then we came back to the camp , Hobomok running me inshore very quickly ; so that if Treeworgy was there I might face him unexpectedly . Captain Oswald stood on the point talking with Lieutenant Church and Lieutenant Steele when the canoe shot in . They fell silent as I jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , ere ? " I asked , trying to look into the gloom beyond them . Steele stared silently across the lake ; but Church , scratching is lugubrious face with his forefinger , said sadly : " What youant of him ? " It came to me that they had failed to give me any greeting t all . " What 's the matter ? " I asked . At once I thought I had the answer . " Treeworgy told you about Enos , of course ! Where he ? " Steele walked away , and Church looked mournfully at the ground . " You 'd best hold your tongue until you 've seen the colonel , " id Oswald shortly.  | " Why , what do you mean ? " I said . " What the hell ails you , treating me like a criminal ! " " Over there , " said Oswald , pointing to an Indian cabin made of bark , sheltered from the north by a heavy clump of spruces , with light gleaming through its cracks . Then he and Church turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bark house with a cold feeling in the pit of my stomach , so bitten with amazement that it scarce occurred to me to wonder how the cabin had come there . I pushed aside the blanket that hung at the door and found Colonel Arnold inside , his field desk balanced on his knee . When he looked up and saw me , he snapped down the cover of the inkwell and threw the desk together with a bang . " By God ! " he said , " you 're either a brave man or the damnedest fool alive to come into this room with me ! " " What in God 's name is the matter ? " I asked , near sick with apprehension . Arnold 's eyeballs gleamed white in his dark , puffy face , which had lost all its pleasing contours and become knubbly , like the surface of the green squashes that we grow in Arundel . Ile sneered at me , making a little hissing sound against his teeth with his tongue , and picked up a heap of papers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , " he said , slapping one of the papers and glaring at me until I thought his eyes would pop out of his head . " You advisedColonel Enos that it was his duty to return to Cambridge with all his troops and provisions ! What have you got to say to that , damn you ! " " It 's a damned dirty lie ! " I said , cold and shaking all over , and feeling as though I had no stomach at all inside my hunting shirt . " Do you dare to stand there and deny " began the colonel . " Deny ! " I cried . " Deny ! I say it 's a lie ! I fought him , for God 's sake ! What are you talking about ? " " I 've got it here ! " shouted Arnold , banging the stump with his fist . " I tell you I 've got it down in black and white ! " He read from his paper . " Here ! " he shouted , " did you or did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they were asking your advice ? Did you or did you not say that if you were in their place you would pack up your bateaux and go home , no matter how much food you had ? " " No ! " I said . " That is , I meant no such thing though I may have used some such words as that in sarcasm . " A hurly-burly of thoughts raced through my head , making me near speechless from desire to speak them all and inability to know where to start . " By God ! " I said , " it was Treeworgy ! Treeworgy heard me ! " " Yes , " said Arnold , his face near black with fury , " Treeworgy heard you say it ! " " I tell you I did n't say it ! " I said . " I said other words with it that changed the meaning of the words you quote to me . " " But you used those words ! " Arnold roared . " Yes , " I said , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't remember what I said ! I tell you I fought Enos and Williams ! This Treeworgy  --  he 's responsible , damn his dirty lousy soul to hell  --  they never would have gone back but for Treeworgy ! " " Oh , " said Arnold , moving his great broad shoulders under his coat and glaring at me as cold and unwinking as a cat out of his pale blue eyes . " Oh , so now you turn it all on Treeworgy ! What was it that Master Treeworgy did ? " " Damn him ! " I said , near crying with my desire to get at him and tear him to pieces . " He took my food and my musket and my canoe , and raced up here ahead of me to tell you lies s to what I said ! " " Good reason , too , " said Arnold , watching me with his round , nwinking blue eyes . " He had heard you advise them to go back , and he thought you intended to go back as well . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did not advise them o go back . I 'd see anyone in hell before I advised him to go back ! And if I advised them to go back , why have I come on myself ? What would Treeworgy have to say to that ? Where is he , the damned gray rat ? " " I 'll tell you what he would have to say , " Arnold said , coming lose to me , so that I tightened my muscles , thinking he meant a take me by the throat . " I 'll tell you what he did say . He saidtook your canoe because he thought you were a coward and could go back with Enos , so that you would have no use
