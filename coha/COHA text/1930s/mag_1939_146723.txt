How TO WIN AND HOLD A HUSBAND-Dorothy Dix - Doubleday , Doran ( $1.98 ) . <P> In Greece and Rome the lovesick asked the oracle . In the modern U. S. , hundreds of thousands of them ask Dorothy Dix . <P> Gimlet-eyed , grandmotherly , soft-drawling Dorothy Dix ( Mrs. Elizabeth Meriwether Gilmer ) is a Southern gentlewoman who as a child liked to ride , hunt , shoot and play with the pickaninnies . A half-demented old family retainer taught her to read : by twelve she knew Shakespeare , Scott and Dickens " by heart , " had " toyed with " the historical writings of Josephus , Motley , Gibbon . She read " no mushy children 's books . " Forty-two years ago she began writing a column of advice to the lovelorn which was not perceptibly influenced by any of the writers who had formed her girlish mind . <P> Last week Dorothy Dix published her second volume of distilled love-lore for the pathetic public that sends her more than 500 letters daily . Wives with husband trouble will read that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read that they must not cheat . But fluttery , did-I-do-wrong girls will be happy to learn Author Dix 's basic philosophy , that Balzac long ago stated more picturesquely : " No matter how black the pot may be , it can always find a lid . " A young girl 's fancies , suggests Author Dix , should be pretty well taken up with locating that lid . <P> Under such headings as " Don'ts " Every Girl Should Know , How to Attract a Husband , Lures Men Ca n't Resist , she chatters of the business of mating in the lower brackets with the kindly solicitude of a slightly prurient older sister and a hard-boiled realism that would do credit to a brothel-keeper . Sample Dix advice to the nubile : " A young girl who lets any one boy monopolize her simply shuts the door in the face of good times and her chances of making a better match . . . . The wise girl keeps a wary eye out to note how a man reacts to the money proposition before she says ' Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grafts are more profitable than comforting a widower . But remember that fast work is required . . . . Girls write their own price tags . . . . Do n't feed men flattery in hunks , with a shovel . They resent this . " One Lure Men Ca n't Resist is : " The come-hither look in the eye , a sort of come-on look if you get what I mean . " <P> But there is one serpent in the Garden of Eden whose game laws Warden Dix has written for the big man hunt . It is free love . Withering is Author Dix 's womanly scorn for virgins who are foolish enough to sell sex short . Their lack of business acumen irritates Dorothy Dix into an epigram : " Free love means what it says . "
