In El Campo , Tex , nine Negroes were jailed , and nearly lynched , for ending a wild Bonus celebration by fatally stabbing and slashing a white deputy sheriff . <P> In Chicago 220 Veterans at Hines Memorial Hospital got out of bed , went home to collect their bonds . <P> When in Manhattan a postman handed Bonus bonds through the securities windows of sedate J. P. Morgan &; Co. to a group of joyous employes , a frosty executive barked : " We ca n't have all this uproar here , " dispatched the postman to the tradesman 's entrance . <P> In a Manhattan saloon , thirsty Peter Gallagher borrowed $10 from the bartender , left $450 of Bonus bonds as collateral , woke up in a hallway next morning , his mind a total blank . <P> Steve Harvey of Dallas who enlisted in the Canadian forces at 13 , transferred to a U. S. division later on , collected $782 as the youngest soldier to fight for the Allies . <P> Despite the many newspaper tales of sots and suicides arising last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green $50 bonds , the average Veteran played a watchful , waiting game . American Legion questionnaires had estimated that the 3,500,000 recipients would spend 30% of the money toward payment of debts and old bills , 7% for housing repairs , 6% for automobiles , 7% for clothing , the rest in a free &; easy manner . Of the same opinion , merchants of every variety had flooded the mails with circulars , kept their stores wide open at night . Get-rich-quick promoters lay anxiously in wait for what Frank Brock of the New York Better Business Bureau described as " the biggest potential sucker list of all times . " <P> But only ones to feel immediately the sudden huge flood of purchasing power were low-priced suit- &-cloaksters,; department stores . Apparently about half the Veterans deposited all their bonds intact , many intending to collect 3% interest until 1945 . Others , accompanied by watchful wives , cashed their bonds , opened savings accounts .
