WENT to the Philadelphia Orchestra Concert the other evening chiefly to hear and report on the new Ravel Piano Concerto , in which Sylvan Levin was the soloist . The reporting is quickly done : The Ravel concerto is about as good and about as bad a piece as Mr. Gershwin would like to write . It is another depressing reminder of the terrible waste Ravel represents  --  a truly phenomenal talent possessed by a man who has no longer , if he ever had , any appropriate use for it . The skill and imagination with which Ravel has calculated the sonorities of this new piece are in keeping with what we are used to from him ; there has probably never been a keener ear or a more discriminating aural imagination . But the cheap triviality of the material in the concerto is appalling . Even the shallow but amusing sentimental irony that used to be his chief distinction Ravel has discarded ; this work , like the " Bolero , " simply sets out to be pleasing in the most superficial way , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing once . Ravel is said to have intended to write not a profound work but one to exhibit the pianist 's virtuosity ; and to have spent two years upon its composition . This is leisure-class art with a vengeance : two years of one of the world 's great talents , for the composition of a work which , except to exhibit the means a pianist should use toward ends in this case absent , has no value whatever . Not that Mr. Stokowski was not right in playing it . Until now a new work by Ravel has always been of interest as the product of a man who had shown a talent so extraordinary that when he said something  --  always of minor importance in itself ? the manner of its expression compelled attention and admiration . But if the " Bolero " and the Concerto indicate a tendency which is to persist , new works by Ravel will not much longer continue to be important events . It would hardly be fitting to devote to Ravel the major portion of a review of a concert by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter  --  the more willingly as there are many things I should like to ask him . For whose benefit do you give concerts , anyway , Mr. Stokowski  --  yours or ours ? You are entirely right in shutting out late corners during the progress of the first complete work on your program . But if your purpose in closing the doors punctually is to avoid disturbance during the playing of the music , why do you rush up to your platform and begin the concert without any notice , so that the first half-dozen measures are lost in the banging of seats and the shuffle of feet of those still in the aisles ? The first half-dozen measures of a symphony are usually important measures , are n't they ? As important , say , as the introductory measures of Debussy 's " Cathedrale Engloutie , " before beginning which you were able to wait so long for complete silence ? Surely you have as much respect for a symphony of Sibelius as for a hackneyed piano piece of Debussy and its anonymous orchestrator . Tell us , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceive between Sibelius and Stravinsky , so close that it prevented anyone from taking his seat between the end of the Sibelius symphony and the beginning of Stravinsky 's " Fire-Bird Suite " ? I should have thought , myself , that whatever unity of mood there was on your program was shared by the " Fire-Bird " and the " Sunken Cathedral " rather than by any other two works ; yet it was just between those two that you chose to make an intermission . Whom would it have disturbed , Mr. Stokowski , if you had allowed the late corners to come in at the end of the symphony ? The rest of the audience ? You do n't really think so . The orchestra ? Their composure is not so easily ruffled . You ? But do n't you realize , Mr. Stokowski , that you 're supposed to be playing for our benefit , not yours , and that we pay you money to put up with the nuisance of having us there at all ? Or is this all tactics , and do you really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we like it ? Two things make all these extra-musical matters really important in your case : the fact that your affectations enter too often into your music itself ; and your undoubted extraordinary talents , as well as your willingness to use them in behalf of " debatable " music , by which you have for years put us in your debt . In performances like those of " Wozzeck , " the " Gurrelieder , " and many other modern works which we know only through you and the League of Composers , you have given us what only your particular gifts and zeal have made possible . We owe to you infinitely more than to numerous When writing to advertisers please mention The Nation other conductors who can never be charged with excess of temperament , or affectation ; and we are grateful to you for giving it to us  --  with or without intrusion of your personality  --  since in unfamiliar works we do not recognize and therefore are not bothered by the interpretative idiosyncrasies that often mar your Bach and your Brahms . But stop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , or your public , really began to place less value on your whimsies ; if you were really to rely on the things most other conductors rely on  --  things which you have in no smaller measure than they . Would it really be so much less satisfactory to be admired chiefly for your noble interpretations and your adventurous spirit  --  instead of for your unpredictable temperament ? There was a time when " modern " composers too were admired chiefly for the surprises they were able to prepare . But surprises can pall , Mr. Stokowski , and I only suggest that it may not be long before conductors ' audiences will go off the golden-haired standard , will , despite the debt they owe you , tire of your unpredictability , or the affectation from which it too often springs . ARTHUR MENDEL Drama The Comic Way I T is no new thing for me to admire the plays of S. N. Behrman . Ever since the Theater Guild produced his " Second Man " some six years ago he has seemed to me not only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to stand for something quite individual and definite . Comedies  --  so called  --  we have in abundance . Wit and shrewdness are fairly common , and , indeed , they are so much in the air that otherwise quite mediocre writers seem sometimes able merely to absorb them , as it were , from the general atmosphere . But comedy , in the sense of a definite philosophy of life in whose terms the events of a play are consistently interpreted , is extremely rare . It implies , of course , far more than merely a sense of fun . It implies the willingness and the power to see all of life in a certain way , and it is just this which Mr. Behrman possesses . Quite unequivocally he takes his stand on the side of the chief comic virtues  --  intelligence , tolerance , and grace . The passions concern him only as something to he analyzed and understood , never as something to be shared , and it is because of that fact that he achieves true comedy . Life , his say , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i exactly the same way . Those who think their way , it achieve grace and a kind of peace . Those who i.o accept what good sense makes plain become grotesque and tortured . It is unreason and perhaps unreason alone which can make men sublime , but it is doubtful if sublimity is worth the price one must pay . Brief moments of ecstasy may well be surrendered in exchange for the detachment , the security , and that sense of mastery which understanding can give . Men can not be great , or just , or heroic ; they can be amiable , graceful , and intelligent . Not , I think , since his first work have any of Mr. Behrman 's plays exhibited his characteristic qualities so satisfactorily as they are exhibited in " Biography " ( Guild Theater ) ? a comedy which holds the interest of the spectator from the first scene to the last and can hardly fail to command the respect of even those whose temperaments are most alien to its spirit . Ostensibly the story is concerned with the conflict of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who cross her orbit  --  one : t rising politician of the conventional type , the other a valuable but frustrated revolutionary who despises the aloofness of the heroine almost as intensely as he despises the hypocrisy of hisadversary . But though the story is told ( as the story of a comedy must be ) in terms of these individuals , it implies as much as one cares to print . The three leading figures represent the contemporary embodiment of three possible attitudes toward the world . One is the eternal idealist , one the eternal opportun , st , and the other that rarer but still eternal thing , the individual who is content with a tolerant personal integrity because he does not believe that the issue between the other two can ever be fought out to any conclusion on the stage of this world . In this play it is the individualist who is left in possession of the field . The two men go their ways , and one knows that they , or at least the things they stand for , will meet many times again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will also be there , and it is to a defense of the virtues of the spectator that the whole is really devoted . " Biography " is not actually a very merry play . It seldom bubbles as , for example , the same author 's " Brief 1/foment " did almost continuously . But it is , on the other hand , firm and sinewy , intelligent and sincere . Possibly no piece which has neither the hilarity of farce , the tension of melodrama , nor the sentiment of what is ordinarily called comedy can achieve the widest kind of popularity . But " Biography " will prove a delight to all who can appreciate the clarity of real intelligence , and the Theater Guild is to be congratulated for producing admirably one of the most interesting plays of the season . The burden of the acting falls upon Ina Claire , who plays the woman of the world with superbly effective restraint , and Earle Larimore , who also does well with the probably more difficult role of the young idealist . " Alice in Wonderland " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be missed . With infinite ingenuity Miss Le Gallienne has translated nearly every one of Alice 's adventures to the stage , and so preserved their almost indescribable spirit that one loses but little while one gains the vividness of dramatic presentation . The costumes and makeups are triumphantly literal re-creations of the Tenniel drawings , but they are hardly so remarkable as the way in which the strange blend of sheer fantasy with elusive but penetrating satire is preserved . I must confess that it was painful for me to hear some of the sallies greeted with a kind of laughter which indicated that these same sallies were unfamiliar ; but this response of persons uncultivated enough to be ignorant of the original was proof that the dramatization was almost miraculously successful . Certain of the scenes , especially those involving the two chess queens and the interpretation of The Walrus and the Carpenter by means of life-sized marionettes , were particularly successful , but nothing else is so significant as the fact that the general spirit was admirably preserved . The play , like the book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the sense of its nonsense . Not even Strindberg 's " Dream Play " actually catches so successfully the feel of a dream  --  the inescapable logic of things known to be unreal and the insistent but never quite graspable relevance of fable or allegory . " Walk a Little Faster " ( St. James Theater ) has nothing discoverable to do with Alice beyond the fact that it lifts its title from one of the many poems to which she was so unwilling a listener . It is , as a matter of fact , a rather unusually disjointed musical review . However , the presence of Clark and McCullough and of Beatrice Lillie was enough to make it extremely entertaining . Miss Lillie , by the way , is not only on the stage a great deal of the time but is very nearly at her best . Revivals of recent plays have a way of being discouragingly uninteresting , but George Kelly 's " The Show Off " ( Hudson Theater ) stands up remarkably well . It is still funny and , like all Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon American life . It should find a place on any list of standard American plays . JOSEPH WOOD KR UTCH
