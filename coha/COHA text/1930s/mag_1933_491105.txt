T HE biggest secret of the depression was the decision of the government . of Great Britain to suspend the gold standard . Only eight men in all England knew it in advance . Why was it necessary to suppress such an important fact , and would it be possible to do likewise in the United States ? The answer to this question has a direct bearing on whether the United States Government could adopt any of the scores of plans and proposals suggested from time to time , ranging all the way from going off the gold standard to devaluating the dollar by reducing its gold content by inflation of the currency . First of all , let it he understood that no nation has ever deliberately gone off the gold standard . Many a country has been forced off the gold basis and has recognized that fact by a law or act ratifying an existing situation  --  namely , when its gold reserves have already been depleted . This was the case with Great Britain in 1931 when the gold drain was such that unless the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been little of the precious metal left as a nucleus for the maintenance of even a managed currency . Had the British people known of the intention of their government to suspend the gold standard , they would have gone to the banks and demanded gold redemption for their money . This would have produced a gold panic . If , as is sometimes suggested by those who would tinker with the national currency , America were to seek to alter its gold basis , the mere introduction of a bill in Congress and its report by a committee would start a gold demand that would be impossible to meet in full . Thus the United States has in its hanks approximately e ? 42,000,000,000 of deposits , but ? we hold only about . $4,500,000,000 of gold . If everybody wanted gold , there would not be enough to go around , and the suspension of payments would be imperative . Between the time , however , of the announcement that some such plan was in prospect and I he actual passage of a law requiring the change , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could visualize its consequences . In Great Britain , where the executive and legislative branches of the government are combined ie a single ministry , it is possible to make such decisions and get immediate ratification . In the United States , where the executive may recommend , but the legislative may differ , there is bound to be debate . And while the Congress debated , the people would lie demanding gold . The fundamental truth , however , which is so often overlooked , is that there is n't the slightest reason for America going off the gold standard or even tit-II-wring ? with the gold content of the dollar . It 's just the other way around . America 's interest is in seeing that the rest of the world shall go back to the gold standard . Even today , while there are fluctuating values for the various currencies of the world . they are all valued for purposes of exchange on some kind of gold basis . The quotations every day , of the British pound , are given in terms of gold . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of the discount below par is measured by daily quotations not only for the British pound but for every other currency in the world . Gold is a symbol of stability . This is because through centuries it has proved a stable medium of exchange . Irrespective of local or domestic conditions in a country where the gold standard may not be abandoned , merchants in that country will make their settlements with merchants in other countries by exchanging gold . I n the Middle Ages , the Byzantine Empire upheld ti gold standard . The use of gold 86 Greetbrrer Golf fo.nr WhitetripburSfraegfrra. spread during and after the Crusades to Italian cities . Silver was used alongside of it , but was always valued in terms of gold . Much of the currency trouble of the world has been due to the undervaluation or overvaluation of silver in terms of gold . The most serious disturtinees , however , have come as a direct result of illusion that the mere printing by governments of pa per money , or hat currency , is just es good as gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when such fallacies as these are removed , countries tend to go hack on a sound basis of gold exchange , and there is stability and prosperity . As they move away from a sound currency . they encounter all sorts of panics and depressions , which have invariably led to human suffering . It is pertinent , therefore , to examine the circumstances of these different depressions and see how the national psychology in almost every instance is improved when there is a recognition of what obligations are due in terms of gold and an aggressive effort is made to meet such payments . Adjustment of debts has been one of the primary characteristics of the final stages of every depression , but there always has to he a yardstick upon which nations as well as individuals can settle with each other , and when there are fluctuating currencies there can be no such measurement . From the lessons of the past we will learn much about the course of events in the immediate and distant future . What has happened to gold is well known to every generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months throughout the world in an effort to stabilize exchange and bring the nations hack to a gold basis is traditionally indicative of the ultimate return of prosperity . It is difficult to estimate exactly the period it will take for currencies to be stabilized once more , but it is an encouraging sign of the times that some of the important , steps toward such stabilization are now in process and that we can recognize them as definitely in the headlines of world news now as we can see in ' retrospect their significant bearing on the winding up of almost every financial depression in world history . The Precloas  --  Metal Increase Because gold is so important a factor in world stability , there are many misconceptions about it . One is that there is a scarcity of gold and that . much of our difficulty today is due to the lack of the precious metal . The facts are lust the opposite . Gold production has been increasing steadily in the last few decades . Thus , for example , from the time that Columbus discovered Ameriea to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More than half of this amount was produced in the first twenty-seven years of the present . century , in different parts of the world . Canada and South Africa are now showing pronounced increases in production . Much less gold is being absorbed in industry and the arts , so that the mining of gold has been stimulated for purposes of exchange . While , however , an increased gold output is desirable whenever commodity prices are low , experience shows that the increases in the precious metal do not immediately affect prices , but DACE TO GOLD tend only in the long run to help correct the disparity between the price level and the gold price . Today there is plenty of gold in the world , but we are annually acquiring , nevertheless , a new supply , so that ultimately prices must rise in terms of gold . If each nation were an isolated unit and the gold supply of each country were increased by production , there would he a different story to tell , but the present holdings of gold are not widely distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the United States and France . The rest of the world needs gold more than we do . In fact , an oversupply of gold in any nation is not conducive to the improvement of world trade . For if balances are to be settled in gold , there must he sufficient amounts possessed by the debtor countries to make such settlements from year to year with creditor countries . Historic Parallels Nowadays we have found ways to make gold a more efficient medium of exchange . We have erected upon a gold base a system of credit , so that the central banks of Europe and the Federal Reserve System of the United States would be able by international agreement to stabilize exchange , provided conditions in the various countries justified such a. step . This is one of the main reasons for the forthcoming monetary and economic conference of the principal nations of the world , the program for which was laid down by a preparatory commission of experts at Geneva in January of this year . It is an interesting coincidence to read that report and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported to the British Parliament its views on how exchange should be stabilized . Fundamental doctrines are the same . As between printing-press money and gold coin , the world has not changed in more than 123 years . To get . our bearings on this gold question , we really ought to go back 300 years and see how regularly countries have tried all sorts of tricks with the gold standard , only ultimately to return to it as the simplest and soundest basis for exchange . English merchants used to deposit their coins in London Tower . But when the king seized a large quantity of coin for war purposes confidence in the Crown disappeared . This led to hoarding in the vaults of the merchants . So it came about that coin was deposited with the goldsmiths , who were the earliest bankers . From time to time as the kings were short of funds , they levied upon the goldsmiths for ready money . After thirty years of economic distress and litigation , the Bank of England was finally incorporated in 1694 and a system of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were several bubble periods , with speculation due to the exploitation of newly discovered lands in America and the increased production of gold from new mines in South America . Stockjobbing came into vogue , and there were bulls and bears in 1700 just as there are today . So long as the currency was subject to the whims of kings , commercial banking could be little developed , but with the establishment of the Bank of England , providing for March 18.1933 bank notes secured either by gold or by promissory notes running for short periods only , there was national confidence in the banks . When the American Revolution was over , the Bank of England had lost in three years at least three-quarters of its gold reserves . The directors of the bank found themselves up against a problem not wholly unlike that of 1931 . They were compelled to build up gold reserves . They restricted loans at first . and refused to advance money to the government for six months , and the cash in the bank amounted to only about . $3,000,000 as compared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans outstanding , amounted to about $30 , - 000,000 . Reduced imports and greater exports were encouraged in order to bring in gold from abroad . Compulsory deflation was abandoned at the opportune moment , and by February , 1784. the gold reserve had risen to $33,000,000 . These hank directors were men who had lived through three great . commercial wars with France , and they adopted a simple rule . It was that while specie was being drained , issues of notes should be held down as much as possible . As soon as the tide turned and there were signs of a reversal in business , currency issues were again extended . This bears a distinct resemblance to the policies of the Federal Reserve System nowadays in endeavoring to make currency elastic , in endeavoring to make gold credit . available in accordance with the needs of business and commerce . The Origin of a Slogan We need go back only to the 1780 's in our own country to find that war inflation had reduced our paper currency to the popular slogan " not worth a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a revolt against debts . The people objected to paying in coin the debts they had incurred in paper values . Business was in bad shape throughout the colonies , and the crisis was finally solved by recognizing that the debts of the war had to be paid  --  individuals were not responsible for the inflation produced by the Government . So Alexander Hamilton proposed and Congress adopted a plan . with sound banking and adequate taxation , and a big bank was established with branches throughout the country . The budget , of course , had to be balanced ; the new nation honored its war debts , and a central reserve bank supplied a national currency . The first thing Alexander Hamilton did was to establish the gold basis . He fixed the ratio of 15 to 1 for silver , in terms of gold , so that both metals were used in the early coinage . In doing this , he conformed to the world price for silver as nearly as possible , rather than any specific ! European precedent . Between 1775 and 1790 the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was this variation in the price of silver in terms of gold that caused gold to flow from one nation to another . It was a form of stabilization . Paper currency was not so highly regarded in those days . Foreign coins were permitted to circulate in the United Slates for a while . Hamilton , it is said , was not aware that the relative production of silver was increasing so that when , in 1803 , France adopted ( ContIn.vd as Page Se ) . ( Continuer ! from Pare 86 ) a ratio of 15 i , 2 to 1 , gold disappeared from this country . " Thus , " wrote the late A. Barton Hepburn , former Comptroller of the Currency , it was early in the history of the United States demonstrated that it was impossible for any one country to maintain independently a ratio between the metals differing materially from that fixed by the world 's markets . " The evils of a disordered currency affected the republic to such an extent during the first three decades of the nineteenth century that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the argument for a ratio of 16 to 1 , which was destined not to be settled until the beginning of the twentieth century . There can be no doubt that in the early days of the republic the influences of financial transactions on the Continent and in England were deciding factors in the prosperity of our country . Trade was interrupted by European wars , difficulties in making exchange were increased by the variations in the commercial ratio of silver to gold . The famous Bullion Committee in 1810 and the debate in Parliament in 1811 brought out clearly all the dangers of currency inflation which we know today . Thus , the parliamentary committee reported in 1811 that the financial crisis was due to an oversupply of goods , failure to sell in the South American markets , excessive warehousing facilities and overspeculation . The banks had loaned more than would have been possible if they had redeemed their currency in gold . Again and again it was pointed out that if paper money is not redeemable in gold , its market value will depend on the amount in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs would cause depreciation . Gold would go to a premium . Or , to put it another way , the pound sterling would go to a discount . The Crisis of 1837 The stoppage of credit- in England had given , in 1837 , the final blow to the American crisis . Provision was made for the resumption of gold payments only after a period of deflation of credit and of readjustment . Public sentiment demanded a monetary basis of gold . When the Bank of England saw that mercantile credit had been cut in half , that note circulation in New York State , for example , had been diminished , its directors moved to support the New York bankers . They shipped 8.5,000,000 in gold in 183S , so as to make sure that the resumption of gold payments on May tenth would be successful . The flow of gold from England to the United States , from the rest of the world to the United States , during the year ending September , 1838 , was nearly 817,000,000 . So when gold came bark , prosperity returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the panic of 1847 in England ; in fact , fully two-thirds of the gold exported from Great Britain came to the United . States in payment of food . Fears of a depression in 1848 did not materialize ; indeed , in 1848 foreign capital began to flow into the United States on a large scale . General buying of American railway and municipal securities by foreign investors , and even state bonds , found a reviving market in London . Then came the California gold discovery , with $8,000,000 in 1849 , about 833,000,000 in 1850 , and about $55,000,000 in 1851 . Bank failures were forgotten . There was more gold than needed to finance commerce , Confidence reigned . The country had come back to gold with a vengeance . The immigrants surged westward , and railroad building began at a rapid pace . Congress aided by giving the railroad promoters rights of way . The bull market for railroad shares began in 1850 . There was some pessimism in 1851 , but it was quickly erased because more gold had been discovered in Australia ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  only slightly less than the $57,000,000 produced in California the same year . London hanks discounted commercial bills at less than 2 per cent per year . Gold 's Comeback in 1858 The bullion in the Bank of England rose from 870,000,000 to 8110,000,000 in a year  --  much more than was needed . So during the three years , 1852 to 1855 , with it total gold output of $355,000,000 , the stage was set for a real intimlion . As has so often happened in the world , when there is a plethora of gold there is apt to be an expansion of credit . More than 400 new banks were organized in the United States in 1853. which represented an increase of more than 50 per cent . Bank capital increased from $208,000,000 to 8.301,000,000 , and hank loans went skyward . Iron and steel prices rose more than 100 per cent , extravagance was reflected in the abnormal imports , speculation was nation-wide . But it was not until 1854 that the break came . Large frauds by railway officials had been disclosed ; illegal issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climax of the panic in 1857 . Before the end of 1856 there were signs of financial strain . The reserve of the Bank of England fell from $33 , 000,000 to $13,000,000 in October of that year . Discount rates on commercial paper rose to 15 per cent in New York for the best paper . There was a scarcity of gold in the banks , and silver also had taken flight . After a. period of heavy gold production , the banks held relatively lit-tie specie . The increase in the world supply of gold was scattered , due entirely to the overexpansion of credit . Bank loans had absorbed the gold . The demand for coin to settle trade balances brought a wild scramble for specie on both sides of the Atlantic . Stock Exchange loans were curtailed , and the Bank of England refused to lend even on government securities . Speculative losses were largo and there were many failures . A money-hoarding panic resulted from the disturbance , and all banks were regarded with distrust . Country banks had their loans called by the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state from suspending payments under any circumstances . The Bank of England did not feel the effects until after the New York banks suspended . London reserves approached the vanishing point and the Bank of England became temporarily insolvent . Heavy failures in the United States were recorded . European houses with American connections were affected , and every large city in Germany suffered too . Had there been strong central banks in all countries , economists believed this crisis could have been averted . There was plenty of gold , but it was not properly distributed , due to lack of confidence . When the banks restored their specie , as confidence returned , there was a recovery , within six months after the panic , of from $80,000,000 in gold to $218,000,000 . In other words , between October , 1857 , and April , 1858 , the banks in London , Paris , New York , New Orleans , Boston and Philadelphia had recovered their gold reserves , and by October , 1858 , they had 8270,000,000 . The business depression following the Civil War came as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold from the United States to Britain . An English panic started the drain , and it was followed by restrictions on credit in the New York stock market . In some respects the depression which began in 1873 and lasted until 1879 was the most severe ever experienced in the United States . Credit could not be expanded because there was an inadequate supply of specie . For six years the economic development of the United States was in a strait-jacket . The railroads had previously opened up large areas . Invention had improved manufacturing and agriculture . There was an increase in production without a corresponding increase in credit . Commodity prices fell . The gold dollar had sold for two dollars in paper in 1865 , but in 1879 the paper dollar was restored to a parity with the gold dollar . General ignorance of monetary science , mistaken ideas about fiscal maters , and the fact that congressmen were more interested in playing politics than in sound finance , made it difficult to revise the National Banking Act in order to get elasticity of credit in times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gold-currency basis . Notwithstanding this , efforts were made to issue more greenbacks ; but President Grant finally vetoed a bill that proposed an increased issue . Rightly or wrongly , there was a belief that the country would be safer with more gold and less greenbacks . As Good as Gold A compromise was effected whereby any further retirement of greenbacks was stopped at $:346,681,000 . Secretary Sherman then began to accumulate gold by selling bonds , the " soft-money " party was defeated in the elections of November , 1878 , and bankers decided that the fight for gold was won ; that greenbacks were now held to be as good as gold . And paper money reached a parity with gold in December , 1878 . The . dollar was at last on a gold basis . Secretary Sherman found sterling at a premium in 1879 and he sold $15,000,000 of bonds in London , and foreign exchanges were stabilized . Gold began to arrive in June and July . Europe was convinced that the Amer-Man treasury was on a sound basis , and foreign investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insured an adequate supply of gold . Immediately afterward , the depression , which had lasted from 1873 to 1879 , started to disappear and better business developed , together with a large American grain crop . Between July , 1879 , and June , 1880 , there were large imports of gold , and the output of the California mines stayed in the United States , and $250,000,000 of gold accumulated in America . The boom which began in 1879 ended in the summer of 1884 , but before the end of 1.885 , due to the fact that the money markets abroad abounded with ready capital , the gold flow started toward the United States once more . The cleaning out among the banks and in the stock market produced a better basis for a business revival , and by June , 1885 , specie had risen in the New York banks from $46,000,000 at height of the depression of 1884 to 8115,000,000 in June , 1885 . Again the sight of gold brought renewed confidence . Railroad promoters resumed construction work , and in 1887 the highest record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a paramount influence in bringing about unsettled conditions in the United States . It was due to a fraudulent note issue in the Argentine , which had caused British investors to suffer severely . The United States showed unexpected strength at first . And if it had not been for the legislation enacted by Congress , prosperity might have continued in the United States . As it was , by 1893 the Silver Purchase Act had the effect of driving out gold . The law provided that silver and gold were to be maintained at a parity , but the flood of silver made that impossible in practice . MoneyrIfoarders of the Nineties A money-boarding panic began . The whole Treasury gold reserve fell to 8114,000,000 , little more than the minimum . The Treasury ceased to pay gold in clearing-house transactions , and the supply of Treasury Notes was increasing at the rate of 850,000,000 a year . The Treasury was rapidly becoming insolvent . President Cleveland , himself a sound-money man , turned to Wall Street for help , and was able to float a Government bond issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve . The reserves were alternately replenished and depleted until President Cleveland contracted with New York hankers to deliver 3,500,000 ounces of gold in exchange for thirty-year bonds . Trade improvement helped to save the Treasury , but for a fourth time President Cleveland was forced to buy gold . The campaign of 1890 , with Mr. Bryan running on a silver platform , brought an election scare in July , 1896 , when the gold reserves fell to 890,000,000 . The business interests rallied to McKinley as the champion of sound money ; and with the defeat of free silver and the establishment of the gold standard , money came out of hoarding and sought investment . Confidence was restored in 1897 , after four years of depression . Recent history is proof of the fact that an adequate supply of gold alone enabled the Allied countries and ourselves to fight the war successfully on a credit base . Suspension of gold payments abroad brought disorganization of the currency , and it was not until several years after the war that the Allied nations were all back on the gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Report of the Commission on Gold and Silver Inquiry of the United States Senate , on which Senators Walsh , of Montana , and Pittman and Oddie , of Nevada , served . In the light of what is happening today , its comment is especially pertinent : If the gold standard is left to itself without interference , it can stand heavy strains ; and there is no case in history of the gold standard breaking clown of its own accord . In fact , it is doubtful if the gold standard ever could break down if left to function without any restraint . If gold as money is allowed to retain its complete freedom , it is almost inconceivable that the gold would all ho exported any more than all the wheat or any other Here is a magic white powder that , when dissolved , puts new life and lustre into old and ailing floors .

Where devaluation is necessary , the first step is to determine the present value of the unit in terms of gold . As a preliminary to returning to the gold standard , it may he desirable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit . and gold . When the exact gold value at . which the unit is to be stabilized has been determined , all that is necessary to make this value effective is that the government announce that after is certain date it will redeem the unit at this value in gold or is draft on a gold-standard country . The government in tho meantime must secure gold or gold credit with which to redeem when the lime comes . Most of the European countries have , or recently have had , various restrictions on exchange dealings , the buying and selling of drafts , or the exportation of currency , restrictions which have been a great handicap to business and which can be enforced only imperfectly . The restrictions almost invariably were either futile or were a hindrance to financial and economic recovery . . . The intergovernmental , or so-called inter-Allied , debt question has occasionally been looked upon as a hindrance to currency stabilization . It is often said that currency reform can not take place until the debt question is settled , and the countries know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to have the debt question settled , unsettlement. does not preclude currency reforms . If the debt question were settled , countries still would not know what their total foreign payments were to be , since these fluctuate widely from year to year . They can not be estimated , and even if they could he , the knowledge would not alter the economic situation . Al New Plan for an Old Question Within the last few weeks , the preparatory commission of experts at Geneva drew up a Man for the World Economic Conference in which some of these same fundamental principles were repeated , as follows : In the field of monetary and credit policy , rho objective must bo the restoration of effective international monetary standards to which the countries which have ahandoned the gold standard can wisely adhere . Each government must , of course , remain free to decide when and under what conditions it could adopt such a standard , and wo do not suggest that this can or should be done without the most careful preparation . However , it will be necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard , leading to a fresh breakdown . The abolition of exchange restrictions is an essential condition of world recovery . For this purpose , the governments concerned must take the internal measures necessary to secure the stability of their budgets and of their economic systems . The restoration of free exchanges is so essential to Lire recovery of economic and financial confidence and to the resumption of the normal flow of international credit that the governments should consider whether they can not expedite the process , In order to do this , some means might be organized by which resources at present immobilized would be put into active circulation and stabilization credits would he provided under appropriate conditions for the countries which require such assistance . So we see in 1933 a world conference ready to discuss that which has been debated and argued for more than two centuries and a half . Gold is the great stabilizer . It is insurance against human mismanagement . It sets up its own checks and balances . It has a tendency to act as a brake on currency and credit manipu-lation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were a hundred years ago , since credit has been highly , ' developed and gold is merely a base for a large volume of credit transactions . But even today , with England supposedly off the gold standard , a ratio ' is maintained to the dollar . In a sense , therefore , England is still on a gold basis . The gold points are , so to speak , wider apart than usual . There is a bigger fluctuation . But Great Britain is quietly regaining gold from different parts of the world . Gold production is increasing too . Nearly every day we read in the newspapers about the feverish efforts . to increase production . The latest report of the Federal Reserve Board shows that the total gold holdings of the central banks and of the governments of the leading countries increased during the third quarter of 1932 , " reflecting in part new gold production , and in part the return of gold from private hoarding in European countries , and in part a return from private holdings in India . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in gold early in 1932 , but we have subsequently recovered all the gold we lost . Our gold reserves are almost at the high point of our history . England has been making rapid progress in regaining public confidence , too , balancing her budget and ' , repressing inflation . Ultimately , Britain will return to , the gold standard , and so will the other . nations of the world , for in all history , it has proved to be the single standard on which international settlements in trade can be made from day to day on a stable basis . Thus , when we see on the horizon the gradual return of gold from its hiding ; places , we can look for prosperity . ? It always happens when the world.goes back to gold .
