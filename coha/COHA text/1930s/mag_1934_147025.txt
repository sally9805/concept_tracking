Day after day last week until perspiration rolled down their faces and their slender grey-haired director was ready to drop , 100 students at the Westminster Choir School in Princeton , N. J. , sang praises to God . They were preparing for this week 's commencement , to be followed by an ambitious two-day music festival . This year , above all others , they wanted to show what they could do . Their choir was building a reputation as the best choral organization in the U. S. And it had undertaken Bach 's B Minor Mass , a stiff test for seasoned professionals . Besides , it wanted to show why it had been invited to Soviet Russia this summer as the first musical group to represent the U. S. <P> The slender , grey-haired conductor , a pious wealthy woman and a Dayton , Ohio church which had earnest hard-working choristers gave Westminster Choir its start . The conductor was Dr. John Finley Williamson , quiet son of a British clergyman , whose aim in life was to improve church music , make it more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the days of Palestrina , Haydn , Bach . The first Westminster Choir ( 1920 ) was composed of factory workers and named for Dayton 's Westminster Presbyterian Church where it sang Sundays . But John Williamson was not content with one group 's singing , no matter how expert . He wanted proteges who , like himself , would be willing to devote a lifetime to church and choral music . In 1926 , encouraged by Mrs. Harry Elstner Talbott , he started the Westminster Choir School . <P> In Dayton the enrolment began with 50 . In Princeton , where the School has settled to be in a college community near Manhattan , the number is up to 100 . And next autumn there will be four new buildings so that the students will no longer have to hike three miles to classes . But John Williamson is proudest of his graduates ' accomplishments . More than 400 have important church jobs . There is a Westminster Choir School in Japan , another in India . A Westminster graduate teaches music at the Silliman Institute in the Philippine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea , Brazil , a bushman from South Africa . <P> The Choir School is largely self-supporting and Dr. Williamson tirelessly supervises its vigorous four-year courses in harmony , theory , ear-training , conducting , hymnology , Bible . The world knows of the School through Mrs. Talbott , whose generosity and energy are a match for Dr. Williamson 's devotion . The hand-picked Choir has been her pet philanthropy . She has financed its visits to over 200 U. S. cities . She took the 1929 singers to Europe where they were teased for drinking their toasts in water . But their music had high praise in every capital .
