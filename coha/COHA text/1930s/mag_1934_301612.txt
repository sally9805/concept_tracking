THE NATIVE 'S RETURN-Louis Adamic - Harper ( $2.75 ) . <P> Not because he disliked the U. S. or was disillusioned about U. S. civilization , but because he wanted to see what the old country looked like after 19 years , Louis Adamic went back to Jugoslavia in 1932 . The Guggenheim Foundation paid his way as a U. S. author for a year 's " creative writing . " Adamic had not intended to spend much time in his native country , much less write a book about it , but he ended by doing both . The Native 's Return , something between a travel diary and a guide book , is better than most such journalistic accounts . Though his book may well make its author persona non grata with the Jugoslavian Government , it should certainly boom the Dalmatian tourist trade . <P> Louis Adamic 's was an exciting homecoming . He had not seen his parents , his nine brothers and sisters for 19 years . Aside from occasional letters to his family , he had long lost all touch with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife to see the old folks . He thought of himself as completely " Americanized . " But almost at the first sight of the Dalmatian coast his forgotten language came back with a rush . In Trieste a Slovene official bade him a ceremonious welcome home , showed him newspapers bursting with his praises . In Jugoslavia , especially in his little native province of Carniola , Adamic was almost a national hero . Puzzled at first , he sensibly decided the fuss- &-feathers; was due partly to Slovene patriotism , partly to the fact that he was a writer . <P> When he had faced the hearty but undemonstrative welcome of his family , peasants in the village of Blato who actually killed their fatted calf for him , Adamic changed his mind about making only a short visit . Louis Adamic became again Loyze Adamich . His Uncle Mikha gave him a dressing-down for not writing oftener to his mother . Uncle Yanez put off dying until he had seen his traveled nephew . Cousin Ton asked him to be groomsman at his wedding . Before Adamic had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ godfather to Ton 's firstborn . <P> After several weeks at home , Adamic and his wife set off to see the country , went the whole circuit . Everywhere Adamic found himself a famed figure , soon was hearing legends about himself and " Mr. Gugnhaim , " an immensely rich U. S. tycoon who had chosen Adamic to make an exhaustive report on the true state of affairs in Jugoslavia , would then set all things right . Adamic , discovering plenty of things that needed setting to rights , says flatly that King Alexander 's Government is a grinding dictatorship , that Jugoslavian jails hold thousands of political prisoners , that if he had not been exceedingly circumspect he would have had no chance of getting the notes for his book across the border .
