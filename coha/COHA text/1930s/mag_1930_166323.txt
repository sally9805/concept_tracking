Quietly and frugally near Brussels live a distinguished Van-Dyke-bearded gentleman , his singularly lovely wife , and a son in the best French tradition of sleek , slightly pale , aristocratic youth . Thousands of Frenchmen call them La Famille Royale and honor as Le Roi de France the gentleman whom the world calls only the Due de Guise . The son , Prince Henri Robert Ferdinand Marie Louis Philippe , is hailed as Le Dauphin de France , or Crown Prince . One day last week as the North Star express from Brussels thundered into Paris , there occurred such a demonstration that pop-eyed strangers might have supposed the Royal Family were returning in triumph to resume their reign . <P> Thousands of Royalists stood massed in the great square before the Gare du Nord , some prosperous , more poor , nearly all bearing bouquets of flowers . Stalwart youths of Les Camelots du Roi , or Royalist League , formed a guard of honor , drawn up in double file , eyes front , facing a lane which extended from the railway platform to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrugs policemen representing the majesty of the French Republic kept at a respectful distance . They would have been mobbed if they had interfered . " Vive la France ! " roared the crowd . " La France royale et immortelle ! Vive le Roi ! Vive le Dauphin ! " and then with a mighty shout , as a little man rushed from the station , " VIVE DAUDET ! VIVE DAUDET ! " <P> The little man was so overcome with joy that tears coursed steadily down his cheeks , sobs choked him . He was unable to respond to frenzied exhortations for a speech . The pandemonium lasted 15 minutes . Almost smothered by his well-wishers , Editor Leon Daudet clung to the famous taxi , the very cab in which last year he was spirited away from the Prison de la Sant to Brussels with French secret service men upon his track ( TIME , July 4 , 1927 , et seq . ) . <P> At last the frantically honking chauffeur was able to get the ancient taxi started and it wheezed slowly off amid a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop at the modest residence of Mme. Alphonse Daudet , widow of the great novelist whose Letters from My Mill have delighted millions . On the doorstep mother clasped son - the son who keeps up an indomitable fight for monarchy as editor of the newspaper L ' Action Franaise . To the paper 's masthead is nailed a stirring line pledging the paper to support the Due de Guise , heritier des quarante Rois qui en mille ans firent la France ! ( heir of the 40 Kings who in 1,000 years created France ! ) * <P> From his mother 's hearth Editor Daudet rushed to the grave of his son Philippe- famed as a martyr royalist . Picture postcards of this youth are constantly distributed by L'Action , each boldly imprinted : " Philippe Daudet , born Jan. 7th , 1909 , assassinated Nov. 24th , 1923 , by the police of the French Republic ! "
