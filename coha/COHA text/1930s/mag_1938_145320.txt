Biochemist Henry Borsook of Caltech declared last week that within 100 years " neurologists will be able to control the evil in mankind on a scientific basis . " In less blasphemous , more scientific language he elaborated : <P> " In the future when a man behaves in a criminal manner , we will not say he is crazy or vicious . . . . Instead we will know that too much pyruvic acid has accumulated in his thalamic cells , or that there is no cocarboxylase , a high-brow term for Vitamin BI , operating in his thalamus . We will be able to tell that he did not grow enough association neurones descending from his cortex , so that now he does not deliver enough acetylcholine to his mid-brain. "
