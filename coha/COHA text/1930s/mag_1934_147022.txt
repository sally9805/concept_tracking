Fifteen years ago the diplomatic bricklayers at Versailles raised many a high wall around Germany . Since last year Nazi persecution of Jews and Communists has raised several new ones . Last week Prussia 's Premier Hermann Willhelm Goring shouted : " The German nation needs room if it is not to suffocate . Germans , too , need air and sun . " <P> Trade Wall . Sir Robert Mond , chairman of the British boycott committee , said last week at Samuel Untermyer 's Yonkers , N. Y. home : " The boycott is highly successful . It is a stupendous uprising of outraged humanity . . . . " <P> How high this trade wall has grown was shown last week in a speech by Nazi Minister of Economics Kurt Schmitt . First he wheedled : " . . . The outside world should recognize that the gigantic efforts the German people and its leaders are making arise from great distress . It would be better if the searchlight were not thrown on our alleged mistakes and shortcomings . . . . Not through mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse with our neighbors will the world be put right again . " <P> Next came a double-barreled threat : " If foreign markets remain closed , not only shall we be unable to continue payment of the service on our foreign debts , but the outside world will not be able to sell to us raw materials in such amounts . Germany will find ways to make a virtue of necessity i. e. , paper clothes , acorn coffee , etc . . Given the present state of our technical methods , it will be not a temporary measure of alleviation but a permanent transformation with immense consequences to world markets . " <P> An angrier note was struck by Reich Commissioner for Justice Hans Frank before Berlin 's American Chamber of Commerce : " No boycott will force us to our knees and the world might as well make up its mind that it is no longer dealing with the Germany of Versailles . . . . We have been called Huns and barbarians because we wanted to expand our constitution . Germany does not intend to interfere with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign interference with her constitution . " <P> Ignoring increases in internal production costs and in raw material imports , boycotters found in Germany 's balance of trade figures proof that their campaign was working well . In January Germany 's balance of trade showed a deficit of 22,200,000 marks ; in February this had mounted to 34,600,000 marks ; in March Germany stopped the decline with a small favorable balance , 3,400,000 ; but in April the deficit showed again , bigger than ever - 82,000,000 marks . Meanwhile the Reichsbank 's gold coverage had dwindled to 4.6% . Last week the Nazi Government , responsive to the adverse trade pinch , reduced once more its total allotment of foreign exchange to private German importers . First fixed at 50% of the 1930-31 figure ( one-half of normal ) early this year , it had been cut to 35% for April , to 25% for May . Last week it all but vanished in the 10% figure for June . At the same time the Government was reducing utilization of reimbursement costs from 70% of the 1930-31 figure for April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
