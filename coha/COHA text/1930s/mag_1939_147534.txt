In room No. 1037 on the south side of a massive , red-brick building in St. Paul last week charwomen were dusting and cleaning and bustling about . On the north side of the ugly old office building , in No. 1030 ( separated by no more than a locked door and a corridor from 1037 ) , more charwomen were kicking the dust and dirt around . No. 1037 had been vacant since Jan. 24 for lack of a president of the Great Northern Railway . No. 1030 had been vacant since Sept. 4 for lack of a president of Northern Pacific . This week both rooms were reoccupied . <P> To succeed Great Northern 's late William P. Kenney , directors picked big , brusque , likable Frank James Gavin ( 58 ) , who joined the road as an office-boy 42 years ago , worked his way up through station agent , division supt. , etc. , became a rock-ribbed " 24-hour railroad man . " A brief man ( he answers telegraphed queries with a snappy " Yes " or " No " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work . But Frank Gavin , who was G. N. 's executive V. P. , knows all about his road from operations to finance . Wise to what is going on in U. S. railroading , he says the roads had better justify their existence as public servants or else . <P> To succeed Northern Pacific 's late Charles Donnelly is the job of big ( 225 Ibs. ) , reserved , ironhanded Charles Eugene Denney ( 59 ) , taken from the presidency of the bankrupt Erie . It was the late , smart Railroader John J. Bernet ( chief operating officer for the Van Sweringen railroad empire ) who first saw that Charlie Denney had something . Son of a master watchmaker , Charlie Denney moved from newsboy to Penn State to Union Switch &; Signal Co. , through a multitude of railroad jobs to general manager of the Nickel Plate . Then Bernet took him to Erie , left him there as president when he went to head Chesapeake &; Ohio . A family man , he used to play avidly with electric trains in his attic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a book , is hep to what it needs today . <P> More than just roommates will be Gavin &; Denney . From Chicago ( by means of joint ownership of the rich Chicago , Burlington &; Quincy ) to the Pacific Coast their tracks run parallel ( G. N. to the north ) . Bewhiskered , one-eyed , oathy James J. ( " Jim " ) Hill tried to combine them in his G. N. railroad empire in 1895 , failed , saw his dream of consolidation in God 's country go up in smoke . Last year N. P. had a whopping $4,300,000 deficit ; G. N. a piddling ( for her ) $2,700,000 profit . Today there is no talk of consolidating the twin grain , iron ore , lumber hauling roads that serve much the same territory . Maybe the arrival of new heads Denney and Gavin will revive it .
