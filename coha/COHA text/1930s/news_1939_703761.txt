txt Acting on the complaint of angry Staten Island residents , the Richmond County grand jury yesterday indicted Sanitation Commissioner William F. Carey , three of his aides and two Health Department officials on charges of contributing to the public nuisance involved in garbage dumping at Oakwood , on the south shore of Staten Island . For the first time in many years the county grand jury took matters into its own hands after receiving complaints of the dumping nuisance . Led by Augustus C. Marscher , their foreman , the twenty-four grand jury members made a personal investigation at Oakwood last November . They were accompanied by District Attorney Frank H. Innes , who at first had sought to dissuade them from returning indictments . Following the visit , the jurymen heard the six city officials and fifty additional witnesses who described various methods of garbage destruction . The Citizens Committee of 10,000 , a borough group , furnished additional information to round out the inquiry . Bench Warrants Issued Just before noon yesterday the grand jury struck by handing up sealed indictments to Supreme Court Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued for Commissioner Carey , John B. Morton , his first deputy commissioner ; Joseph A. , Richmond Borough Superintendent of the Sanitation Department ; Albert J. Lizee , city-wide superintendent of land fill in the department , and the two Health Department officials . They were Dr. John Oberwager , director of the Health Department 's sanitary bureau , and John Rosenberg , head of the Health Department 's inspection force . Commissioner Carey and his aides were charged with violating Section 811 of the Penal Law and the indictment accused them of " causing enormous quantities of putrid , decayed , decomposed animal and vegetable matter , raw garbage , refuse and other noxious , foul , offensive and fetid substances " to be delivered to the Oakwood dump . The charge contained five misdemeanor counts . Dr. Oberwager and Inspector Rosenberg were accused on two counts of violating Section 1,530 of the Penal Law . The indictment against them accused them jointly of having presented a false official report of conditions at the dump . Mayor Charges Politics As soon as he heard of the grand jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to politics . He named William T. Fetherston , Democratic leader of Staten Isfand , in this connection , and said : " I think that the city will pretty soon get an inkling of what I mean by opposition to the normal and regular administration of city affairs . Mandamuses by the wholesale , injunctions by the scores , and now , starting to arrest officials for doing their duty . The names of those arrested speak for themselves . " Of course , Mr. Carey was taken from a $100,000 position and brought into the city service , and he is doing an excellent job , rendering great service . If he had been taken from a green-covered table in the back room of a political club , I suppose he would have been given a medal or a monument . We are perfect3-willing to fight it out and I will back Mr. Carey fully . " When the Mayor was asked for the basis of the charges , he snorted : " Basis ? The basis is Fetherston . " Mr. Fetherston said later that the Mayor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer it . Detective Sylvester Lyle of the Richmond District Attorney 's office came to Mr. Carey 's office yesterday afternoon , was affably received and stayed to have lunch as the guest of his " prisoners . " Mr. Carey said it distressed him to be described as " a nuisance , " but he indicated that he would grin and bear up . When reporters gathered at his door he threw up his hands in mock astonishment and said : " What 's this  --  you 're not ashamed to mingle with a convict ? " Asked for reaction to the indictments , he said : " I have nothing to say about them ? nothing but that we are about to leave for jail . " " Detective Lyle has just had lunch with me . That 's sort of an advance payment for the hospitality I expect from him in the Richmond County Jail . " " Have you some one to go bail for you ? " Mr. Carey was asked . " Oh , there will be some Good Samaritan to take care of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip to Richmond would not be made in a Black Maria , an expression of exaggerated disappointment came over Mr. Carey 's face . " Well , then , " he said , " I 'll invite the Chief Sheriff to ride in my car . " " And will the others go with you ? " was the next question . " Oh , yes , " he replied jauntily . " Birds of a feather always go together . " Calling his associates together for a. picture at the request of photographers , Mr. Carey said : " Come on up here , you convicts , " and the shot was taken . The six officials , with the exception of Mr. Rosenberg , who is ill , were booked and fingerprinted in the St. George police station yesterday afternoon . Arraigned before Justice Norton , the five pleaded not guilty through Assistant Corporation Counsel Alvin K. Sylvester , who came . over to represent them . They were paroled in Mr. Sylvester 's custody , and Justice Norton set Jan. 20 as the date for a further hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition permits . Outside the court room Mr. Carey was asked if he was taking the proceeding in good humor . " Well , I do n't want to get facetious about it , " he replied , " because the people of Staten Island are serious about it , or I 'm sure they would n't have done it . It is an interesting experience , though . " In former years the city operated an incinerator near Oakwood , but the building has recently been shut down and the land-fill method of disposing of waste has replaced incineration . The Staten Islanders have not objected to the use of clean land fill , but they are strenuously opposed to what the indictments described as an uncovered heap of garbage which " caused volumes of noxious gases to escape daily and the infestation of the dump with flies , rats and vermin which swarmed in and about public streets and buildings and caused people to become sick and nauseated . " Richmond officials expect Assistant Corporation Counsel Sylvester to move first to obtain the minutes of the grand jury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ground that there is insufficient evidence to justify them . If that move fails , the city Law Department is prepared to fight the case through the courts .
