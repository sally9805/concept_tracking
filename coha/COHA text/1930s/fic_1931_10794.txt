arm still in Sally 's , whose face was very white . Exceptfor a low murmur here and there , the news was received in a shocked silence . One smothered , hysterical giggle came from the girl who sat nearest Dorothea . As for Phil , he was n't there at all . He had remained inside , looking out from an unlighted room . What was to be said by him or by anybody else , Red and Sally did n't stay to hear . They went back into the house , around and up by the curving staircase , to find the two whom they most dreaded to face . Even the redoubtable surgeon dreaded it , and had the grace to feel pretty sorry for his sistersin-law , really charming women in ordinary times . There was just one speech of his which remained in Sally 's memory after it was all over : " Evelyn , no matter how hard on you this whole break-up is  --  and I appreciate that it ca n't help being that  --  there 's just one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to save your daughter 's life . Measures to save her happiness are hard for you to adopt at the eleventh hour , but there 's nothing else to do . I 'd run away with her myself and never come back rather than see her make this marriage . " Tears , hysteria  --  they were to be expected.  |p41Nerves  worn with weeks of planning and executing , with visits to dressmakers , with the whole machinery of an elaborate wedding . There really was , even to the blunt doctor , every reason why Sally 's mother should go all to pieces . But nothing could justify , to him , her wild reproaches of Sally , her fury over the breaking off of this match , which seemed to her to be so eminently desirable -- But Sally rose to it . " I 'm terribly sorry , Mother , " she said , her eyes pitiful but her lips controlling themselves . " It 's all  --  all  --  my fault  --  absolutely my fault . I should never have let it happen . I was weak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can . But anyhow , you do want me to be happy , do n't you , dear ? " Mrs. Beaumont raised her tear-stained face . " Happy ! " she cried . " Do you mean to tell me you 're happy , after having done this crazy thing ? . . . Do n't you care a particle for having hurt poor dear Phil like this-to say nothing of the rest of us ? " " Phil wants to marry Dorothea , " said Sally . Then she added steadily : " And as for my being happy  --  right now  --  of course I 'm not . I feel a fiend to have upset everybody like this . And yet  --  compared with the way I felt an hour ago  --  I 'm so happy I could cry for joy . "  | " Come away before you do it , " said Red in her ear . Then he added : " I 'm going to take Sally off for a few days , Evelyn . You 'll do better here without her . Good-night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brute  --  but a man has to be , sometimes , to save women from throwing themselves over a cliff into the sea . " Sally packed a bag blindly , not knowing what she put into it except that she made sure of a few necessaries . It was better to go , she knew , even though it meant leaving everything to her mother and aunt . The repacking and dispatching of the wedding gifts would be done , as it would have been done , in any case , by men hired for such business . But with herselfout of the way it would be easier for her mother to give it all up , to let down from tension , and to come back to normal . One thing was certain : Mrs. Beaumont would n't have any disconsolate bridegroomto condole with . Phil would n't come near her . And as for his family , well , Sally could n't help them . The thing was done . SALLY and Dr. Burns drove the thirty miles in almostabsolute silence . It was impossible for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to a sort of spiritual collapse . She had become numb to feeling , she thought , and welcomed the release from any need to bother her tired brain . The comfortingnearness of the silent man beside her , the knowledge that he would expect nothing more of her to-night , but would understand just how limp she had become , was of itself soothing . The warm air of the quiet night lapped her as with a gently flowing river . She need n't do one thing , smile one smile , say one word , she did n't want to . After weeks of what she looked back on as pretense , acting in a drama whose ending she was dreading with every hour it drew nearer , she was like one who sees the audience vanish , the lights extinguished , and the need for further effort gone . Bed  --  rest  --  sleeptheseseemed the only things in the world she wanted , at the end of the drive . Let the coming day take care of itself . In the home of Aunt Ellen and l @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove like a meteor through the night , Red 's thoughts were again busy . Having disposed of one problem , he was mentally attacking another . " When did that letter come ? " he was asking himself . " And what the devil did I do with it ? Worsep44yet , what did I do with the layout he sent ? Anything may have happened while I was away . If I ca n't find those . . . See here  --  I 've got to find ' em . They 're essential . If I were n't so infernally careless with stuff that 's sent me . . . " He worried about it all the way home . A letter . A lot of material mailed " under separate cover . " Rememberingall this had been a magnificent inspirationwhich had come to him at the time that he was waiting outside the Beaumont house while Sally made ready to accompany him . But it was no inspirationif he could n't remember where to find that which had caused it . " Should have a file case for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Invaluable sometimes . If I ca n't find ' em . . . " He grew foggier and foggier over it . A fellow could be clever enough at one hour and just plain moron the next . He became positive that he had , as the law says , destroyed the evidence . When he took Sally into his own home , at last , his one idea was to begin his search the very moment he was free , and keep it up the rest of the night , if need be . " In here , " said Red , indicating a small but in/viting guest room and following Sally in to set down her little handbag on the rack meant for it . She had often slept there before , but the place had never seemed such a refuge as to-night . " And I want you to stay here till you are ready to get up . Pop into a hot bath  --  it 'll help let you down . In fifteen minutes I 'll come in and feel your pulse and tuck you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay , a slim , quiet figure , between Aunt Ellen 's fine , faintly fragrantsheets , she let both bare arms fall straight out , to right and left of her , closed her eyes , and lay waiting for Red to keep his promise . That meant as much as anything just now . " All right ? " He came softly in , bearing a little tray with a glass of hot milk upon it , and some thin , crisp wafers . Sally had switched off her lights , but those in the hall outside showed her clearly to him . Her eyes were open now and regarding him . " Yes  --  quite all right , " she whispered . " Sit up a minute and drink this . I suppose you 've been living on fussy food for weeks . This will make you think you 're a small girl again , and make you sleep , too . " She sat up , and he placed himself upon the edge of the bed behind her , so that his shoulder supported her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there never was anybody like Uncle Red , who could put her through the fight she 'd been in tonight , egging her on , standing by her  --  and then treating her like the exhausted child she had turned into . She took as long as she could to drink the milk and nibble the wafers , so that she might feel his warm heart beating against her back . Why could n't all women be as lucky as Aunt Ellen and find for themselves men like this , instead of marrying gay blades of no account who would never become towers of strength like Redfield Burns , but would keep their wives uncertain of them all their days ? The picture of Phil Filmore and Dorothea Morton came suddenlybefore her . If Dorry actually should marry Phil , she would have to look at pictures such as Sally had seen to-night until she became hardened to them and ceased to mind that she had an incorrigible philanderer for a husband . Or  --  Dorry would doubtlesskeep up her end , matching or outdoing Phil . Then there would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that divorces mostly came , was n't it ? " Now lie down , child , " said Red in her ear . " Stop thinking about all that . Just remember you 're here  --  and safe  --  and that this is n't the end of your life . It 's only the beginning . I promise you that . " He laid her down himself and drew the sheet to her breast . How many times , during these past years , when he had been trying to build up her physical strength , had she looked up into his sturdy face , promised him she would do exactly as he asked her , no matter how disagreeable his orders , and been rewardedhis smile and his big bear hug ? She put up her arms now , as she had done then , and felt again  --  it had been a long time now since this had happened , because Red 's prescriptions had worked out so well  --  his arms about her , his cheek pressed against hers . He held her very close to-night , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her he was telling her again that she was safe . " Good-night , Uncle Red . You 're such a darling . " " You 're pretty much of one yourself , Sally . " He went out and closed the door , and though she would n't have thought it possible , because she had been sleeping very badly ever since those wedding invitations had gone out , she was off almost instantly , like the tired swimmer who has at last touched bottom and has waded up to the dry sand and thrown himself down upon it.  |p48ALONE  in his own room Red went to his desk and began his search . That letter  --  that big manilla envelopecontaining a set of photographs  --  what on earth had he done with them ? The letter presently came to light , but it took him a long time to unearththe rest of his material . Finally he discovered it , in a many-shelved cupboard where he was accustomed to fire things when he was in a hurry to clear the desk . All right ! Now to make big medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reread the letter , which had come from the wilds of the Canadian Northwest . He was much interested in that letter . DEAR DR . BURNS : You certainly knew what you were doing when you sent me off here . It 's been a great job , growing steadily more interesting , and I never can tell you what I 've got out of it . When I came I did n't begin to know how soft I was , nor in how much danger of never amounting to anything . But physically I 've grown hard as nails , working on this great piece ofp49construction . I 'd never have believed I 'd get such an amazing kick out of my little part in the whole thing . I hope I 'm of a bit better stuff mentally , too  --  or wherever it is that a fellow begins to grow something besides pin-feathers . It was the most magnificent luck that I could be under the Englishman , Leslie Warden , you knew and liked so much . He 's been a regular trainer for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job of life . I 've had more out of him than I ever got out of the schools . Most unassuming fellow in the world , as you know , but the real thing is in him  --  the thing one has to learn to live by . You know what that is , Dr. Burns , I do n't need to try to tell you . I could n't put it into words , anyway . In another month , I 'm coming home . Now that the two years are over , during which time I have n't been out of the wilderness for more than a day at a time , I 'm getting a tremendous thrill out of the thought that in four or five weeks more I 'll be back in the States . During all that time I 've hardly been out of high boots , so to speak . And seeing only men . Most of them pretty rough , but I 've learned how to get on with them , and a few of them have been corking . And always there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour during Commencement week , just before I left , when I was walking across the campus , on a wonderfulJune night , with a pretty girl  --  an awfully pretty girl  --  with whom I 'd been dancing , and of wondering why I was bored to death . I know how foolish that sounds ! I thought I was tired of girls , tired of everything , was on my way to making a failure of life . I was booked for this job , but that seemed to me just a way of escape , for a while , from my world . I did n't expect to like it . I had n't taken any honors of any sort ; you know I 'd just barely squeaked through . I had n't even been especially popular . Four years before , I 'd seen my brother Rivers walk away with everything . He 's still taking honors , by the way , and always will be , and I 'm darned proud of him . As for me , I 'm only just getting fit to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burns . . . Well , maybe you know how a fellow feels , after such an absence , at the thought of meeting girls and women again . I expect I 'll be scared to death of them  --  forgotten my manners and how to talk to them , if I ever knew . But I want to meet some . I might better say I want to meet some one . For I 'm going to be off again in only two months with Lesliep51Warden , and this time we wo n't be quite so isolated . He may be getting married in the interval , and if he should , he feels it will be safe to bring his wife . If she is n't game to come that will end it , for he thinks his life for years will be on these out-ofcivilizationjobs . If she does come , I suppose I 'll envy him . Dr. Burns , you 're the greatest doctor and the wisest man I know . When I get home I 'll be thrown with plenty of girls  --  my family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , and I 'll be bewildered among them , and a good bit shy , as I always was . The kind of girls I 'll meet wo n't be the kind I 'm thinking of . If you happened to know of anybody I could meet right away . . . You see , I 've only those two months , with another two years in the wilds to follow , and I could waste every minute of the time just playing around . I ca n't afford to do that . And a fellowon a job in the mountains and valleys where bridges and dams are built has a chance to be pretty lonesome when it comes to moonlight nights of a sort that get in a quite different sort of work on him than  --  well  --  than that which makes him leery of cocktails and dance music at home , lest he make a fool of himself with the wrong girl.  |p52But  that's. enough of that , and more than likely you 're smiling over this naive , schoolboy sort of maundering . No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of way . And I would n't write a word of it to another soul I know . Anyhow , whether you can prescribe for me in this way , as you prescribed so successfully two years ago when I came into your office looking like a piece of suet , or whether I 'm suggesting the impossible , I 'm coming straight to your office again when I get back . I want to see you , and I hope you 'll be glad to see me . I 'm sending under separate cover some photo . graphs of the great bridge , with a couple of close ups of Leslie and myself . I 'll admit I was glad to have them , to show people what Leslie Warden is like . Even so , nobody who does n't know him can guess . The letter was signed " Jefferson Shipley . " As Burns studied the pictures of his young friend Jeff and the Englishman , Warden , an expression of intensesatisfaction spread over his face . Jeff looked every inch a man , and no less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing and the wind blowing his hair.  |p53Red  's thoughts went back to Sally Beaumont ; his mind had been working on this possibility for her ever since he had suddenly remembered Jeff 's letter . It now occurred to him with some force that Jeff 's elder brother Rivers might very conceivably be the man to whom Sally had referred as having captured her youthful admiration and whom she thought she could n't forget . Jeff himself she might never have known , except as a youngster , only a little older than herself ; while she , in those years of growing up , had thought nothing of him , only of his brother , who had been such a shining mark for general approval , not to mention that of the girls in their twenties , one of whom he had married .. If it should be so . . . Burns whistled softly to himself . And even if it should n't , here was Jeff , begging him to introduce him to the right girl , because he had so little time to find her before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , was Sally the right girl ? Was she equal to the order of being a wife for such a man as Jeff had become ? Red rather thought , in view of all he had known of her in past years , that she was capable of becoming such a wife . He still did n't understand how she had ever thought she could marry Phil Filmore , yet  --  well  --  had n't he himself , P54in his earlier days , done many a mad thing which he had afterwards regretted ? Why should he think an exquisite little beauty like Sally ought to have been wiser than her clever but unwise mother ? If she could know Jeff , it might be the making of her . And she was , Red would swear it , the sort of girl with whom Jeff could not only look at moonlightin a canyon and be glad that she was there , but be glad next day that she was with him , when the moonlight was gone and the sun was shining or the rain raining on the less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't hesitate for a moment to undertake the business of bringing them together , though he fully recognized that it could n't be done by means of a bludgeon . " No , not by a bludgeon , " said he to himself , " though I 'm afraid that represents my usual style of finesse . I must be more artful than that . Let 's see . . . . HE LOOKED about him for a frame into which to put the photograph he liked best . It was rather a large one , made like the others in the set by a photographerwho was getting together material for ap55magazine article on this great piece of engineering construction of which Jeff 's friend , the Englishman , Leslie Warden , was one of the assistant engineers . Red 's eye lighting on a picture on his wall which contained a mere landscape in France some patient had sent him , he quite ruthlessly took out his knife , ripped away the backing , clawed out the small nails , and removed that picture , beautiful enough of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first interest , always . The power in a personality  --  that was what he sought , before everything else . Jefferson Shipley and Leslie Warden , standing , two slim sinewy figures against the sky line , presently looked at Dr. Burns out of the appropriate setting of a simple black frame . Next , to place it where it would catch the eye ! Just above his desk was the spot , at the left , where anyone interviewing him would be sure to see it . He removed another picture from the wall ; it was that of a distinguished Englishsurgeon , but he went into the discard for the time being , just the same . Burns stood back , hands in pockets , eyeing the result . There was a wicked sparkle in his eye . The trap was set . It would n't be his fault if Sally Beaumont , though fresh from pacingdown the aisle in rehearsal for a wedding which would never come off , should within a day or two in the house notice the photograph and ask for the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the necessary reservations . As he remembered seeing Rivers Shipley the last time , perhaps a year ago , he was still the charmingly urbane and interesting person who had been a leader all through the schools and was now doing unusually creditable work in the world . But there was little question in Red 's mind that the photograph of Jefferson Shipley , in his rough engineer 's garb , in his face a strong resemblance to his elder brother , could be a formidablerival to any girlish memories of that engagingly picturesque figure . Jeff might not be quite so picturesque , but Red had an idea that he had the real stuff in him , and more than likely to an even greater degree than Rivers , who had " taken all the honors . " As he left the room finally for bed he gave the photograph one more glance before he switched off the lights . The trap was set , he said to himself with a grin , if it was n't sprung . It would n't be his fault if some day  --  snap ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a case of justifiable homicide . P57LETTER from Dr. Burns to his sister , Anne Sutherland , in a sanitarium in Southern Italy . DEAR ANNE : Back from Baltimore , where I saw Jack Leaver do several gorgeous operations  --  and then lose a case he 'd set his heart on bringing through . It was n't his fault  --  it was n't anybody 's fault , so far as could be discovered . But the patient was a well known bishop of the Church , a man everybody knew and most people loved ; nobody had even known he was ill . The news of his death shocked the city . ifs for Jack  --  well  --  I was glad I was there . He felt that all the patient 's friends would consider it a case of unnecessaryinterference , that a man who looked the picture of ruddy health could n't need an operation , etc.  --  the sort of thing that gets said when a man marches smiling into a hospital as though he were going to a feast and then in a few hours is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Poor Jack ! Did n't I know ? Oh , God  --  what men of our profession suffer under such circumstances  |p58nobody  but themselves and their colleagues understand . It 's plain hell . But there 's nothing to do exceptput on a defensive armor of dignified silence and go on about one 's business . I wo n't try to describe the indescribable to you . I 'll talk of something more cheerful . And that 's a case of interference of a different sort . You remember Ellen 's niece , Sally Beaumont . Gem of a girl I 'd had the pleasure of working over during her adolescence to make a frail little body into a sturdy one . I 'd done it , too , superbly assisted by Mother Nature and the great sun god . Anyhow , I 've grown immensely fond of Sally and proud of her . Getting back from this Baltimore trip , I found she was on the verge of marrying as rotten a young scion of a family of good social standing as ever had the impudence to ask a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probability of children that might be cursed from birth with their unfair inheritance . Of course , my blood boiled at the thought , and  --  to make a long story short  --  I dashed out to the place where the crime was about to be committed , held up the chief criminal at the point of my six-shooter  --  so to speak  --  and stopped everything . No , I ca n't tell you all about it , my dear , but your imagination canp59fill in the details . Luckily , Sally was glad to be rescued , not on the count on which it was done  --  she was ignorant of that  --  but because she 'd let herselfbe more or less driven into a loveless marriage by her mother 's ambitions  --  a fine word for it , eh ? She 's here now , with me , getting her breath again . Ellen 's still down South , but will be back soon . Meanwhile , I 'm enjoying myself up to the hilt , though a trifle uncertain as to what I 'd better do next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Anne . You think I 'm still a boy and love nothing so much as cutting a great dash in the centre of the stage . I 'll admit I have a strong sense of drama and probably ought to have been a cowboy in the old days of wild adventure on the Western plains  --  or a performer in a present-day three-ring circus . Yet I swear to you that 's only one side of me . The other side is sober enough . An old  --  and much older  --  friend said rather solemnly to me the other day : " Red , you 've never grown up . " It set me thinking . Have n't I grown up ? Unless one 's a moron , can he help growing up ? Especially can one who every clay holds life and death in his hands , and realizes it with every artery he ties , help growing up ? He may whistle as he goes past the graveyard , to keep his6o RED PEPPER RETURNSp60courage up  --  and that of the other fellows who are going past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make any study of life and its complexities , does n't appreciate the tremendous forces at work in both the material and the spiritual world , does n't think  --  just whistles ? My solemn friend has the mistaken notion that whistling is one of the major indications of a hollow head . I hope he enjoys his own long face when he looks at it in the glass . Enough for this time , Anne , my dear . I hope the slung leg has by now become resigned to its temporaryindignity , and that you get sufficient easing of position to make things bearable . It 's a mean situation  --  butthink of the enormous relief when it comes down to the level/Best love , RED . P61IT WAS two days before Sally came Into Red 's privatequarters , uninvited and unforced . These quartersconsisted mainly of a big square room on the second floor containing a desk and bookshelves filled with scientific treatises of all sorts , with a sprinkling of volumes of history , travel , and adventure . It also had a roomy couch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk . Red had been tempted to use the bludgeon in gettingSally in , but had resisted . She was accustomed enough to coming to the room , whether Red were there or not , which he mostly was n't . It was a good place in which to read or write , undisturbed . Sally had been writing letters , these two days , but she had done it in her own room . This evening she had received a telegram . With it she made her way to lied . He had been busy during the days , but he had kept the evenings for her , and he had about made up his mind that if she did n't appear by to-night he was62 RED PEPPER RETURNSP62going to be taken alarmingly ill in that room and have her sent for to minister to his needs . She came in after knocking at the open door . Red looked up from his seat at the desk . He had noiselesslytransferred himself to that position , after hearing her door open and close , down the hall . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Shall I bother you ? " He looked up . " Oh , it 's you ! Not a bit . Just let me make a note or two on what I want to say to this idiot . Take this chair , wo n't you ? " It was the one near his desk which faced his cunningly arranged trap . But Sally chose to drop into a corner of the big couch , with its inviting pillows , where she read and reread her telegram until Red finished doing that which he was not doing at all . " All right , " said he , putting away his hypothetical work . He took out his pipe and began to fill it . He did n't intend to go and sit on the couch beside her and defeat his own ends . He remained in his desk chair . She could talk across the considerable space if she wished , but he would hang onto his strategic position.  | " I 've a wire I want to show you , " Sally began , looking across at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and got it going . He settled back in his chair , with one arm upraisedand his hand behind his neck , as though it had an ache in it and needed nursing . " Fire away , " he said . So she got up and came over . It was the only thing she could do , unless she wished to converse in loud tones , which she did n't . It was stupid of him to prefer to remain in that desk chair , but , of course , if he did she could n't very well pat the seat beside her and say : " Oh , please come and sit here . " Aunt Ellen always let him do as he pleased , after one of his crowded days . Her thoughts were concentrated on her telegram . She did n't look up at the wall before her  --  why should she ? She was familiar with its appearance ; she had studied the varied collection of photographs many times and had heard the story of most of them . " Uncle Red , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know you 'll think it pretty nice news . I 'm . ailing for England day after to-morrow with  --  you never could guess what luck it is  --  Miss Elizabethp64Stuart . You must remember her ? The one teacher I had at school who seemed to me almost the most interesting woman I ever met . She 's a real person . She has a cottage in South Devon , on the coast , near Torquay , and she 's just running over to spend July and August in it . She understands  --  well , of course she was sent the cancellation of the  --  invitation . She wrote me at once , and I wrote back , and then came this wire . It 's just too wonderful . If there 's anybody in the world I can bear to be with just now , it 's Miss Stuart . Except , of course , you and Aunt Ellen . But this will just take me away from everything . I 've telephoned Mother , and even she thinks it 's a godsend . You think so too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red ? " Crash ! All his plans for her in ruins . But he had to play up . He had n't even heard from Jeff Shipley again . There was no argument to be advanced against Sally 's accepting an invitation which she had already accepted . She looked keen about it , too . No doubt , if she was to go away at this time , there could n't be a finer companion than Elizabeth Stuart . Red knew Miss Stuart . A remarkable person , still comparatively young , spirited , attractive , yet wise and balanced . She would be a tonic for any depres/sion of spirit which must linger for a time , at least , with Sally Beaumont . " It certainly sounds great , " he said , with a forced heartiness . He had n't realized how he had set his heart on bringing about his daring schemes . But one could n't always  --  or often  --  stage-manage people about successfully ; he knew that well enough . Still  --  he would n't let her get away without a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw up her engagement with Miss Stuart at sight of it and cry : " Here 's the man ! " She was n't thinking about men now , anyway . She was thinking about the South Devon coast , and a small cottage , where people would n't surreptitiously look at her and say to one another : " How do you think she 's taking it ? We all know it was Phil Filmore who did the backing out , only he let her have the honors . When do you suppose he 'll marry Dorry Morton ? " " It is great , " agreed Sally . " I 'm so glad you approve . But I should db it , anyway . Nothing so heaven-sent as that could be ignored . My only reluctanceis because I shall have to wear  --  and take . . . No , I vow I wo n't do that , either . I 'll go off in my old clothes . " 66 RED PEPPER RETURNS " Do that , by all means , " advised Red . " Give the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it when you come back . Anyhow , your thinking about what you 'll wear is a good sign . The woman who is absolutely in despair leaves the house with only what she happens to have on at the time , even if it 's evening dress in zero weather . No , you 're still healthy of mind , my dear , thank God ! " " I believe so , " Sally assented . " And here 's another healthy person , " observed Red , abruptly wheeling about in his chair and lookingup at the wall where , with a favorable light upon it from a lamp cunningly turned in that general direction , hung the important photograph . Not at all important now , he feared , yet , by jiminy , he could n't resist deliberately calling her attention to it , since it seemed the only way to make her see it . " Two of them , in fact , " he went on . " Ever see a couple of rougher-looking young brigands ?

" Sally looked at it from where she sat . " Jolly outdoorscene , " she commented , without rising from herP67chair for a closer view . " Where is it ? In the Rockies ? " Red wanted to take her by the scruff of her pretty neck and haul her into position before the picture . In the Rockies ? What did it matter where it was ? " Northwestern Canada , " he explained briefly , and himself rose and took down the frame and handed it to her . " The one on the right is Leslie Warden , a young British railway engineer . Mighty nice chap . The other 's my former patient and special friend  --  JeffersonShipley . Does n't look much like anybody 's patient right now , does he ? " " Neither of them does . What a fine face the Englishmanhas , " Sally observed . She seemed to be concentrating on him . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't turned a hair at the mention of it . She must know that Jeff was Rivers Shipley 's brother , and Rivers htd certainly been the shining youth whom Sally in her young girlhood had worshiped afar off and hard said she could n't forget . Jeff looked like Rivers , decidedly  --  at least , he did in town clothes . Red supposed the outdoor outfit with the high boots was more or less of a disguise. 68 RED PEPPER RETURNSp68He was all at once out of patience with his whole absurdly romantic strategy . What of it all now ? Sally would be off for England before Jeff turned up , and Jeff would be off for Northwest Canada again before Sally came back . " So has Jeff a fine face , and a strong one too , to my thinking , " he said gruffly , and held out his hand for the picture . But Sally retained it , studying it . " What a gorgeous job , " she said . " No wonder anybody 's healthy who lives all the time in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Until that road 's built there 's no way in or out except by plane . They do n't come out much . " She asked him details about the construction , seeming much more interested in that than in the two figures of the engineers , with other men at work in the background . He gave such information as best he could , taking out Jeff 's letter and reading her the paragraphs of description . ' When he had finished she rehung the picture herself . " How many hundreds of miles is that place , do you suppose , " she asked , " from a bridge luncheon or a tea ? Though I suppose the Englishman has his tea at four o'clock , no matter how far he is out ofp69the world . Having it sitting on a log would n't be so bad . What did you say his name was ? " " Leslie Warden , " replied Red aloud . In his mind he added : " Hang the Englishman  --  or are you only pretending he 's the one who interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guile . " " Well , I 'll soon be having my tea in South Devon , " remarked Sally . " You simply ca n't imagine , Uncle Red , how the thought cheers me ! And with Elizabeth Stuart . We 'll tramp miles , through those enchanting lanes with the high hedges that I 've always been wanting to see again , after once beholding them in apple-blossom time . I must run away now . znd write another letter . " She left him . The game was up . " What an old fool you are , R. P. , " he said to himself . " Ca n't you be satisfied with breaking up a wedding , without trying to make a little Cupid out of yourself , with wings ?  --  Timings ! " ON THE day of Sally 's sailing Red could n't get away to see her off . Ellen had n't yet returned . As Sally came down to breakfast he had met her at the foot of the stairs to give her a hug and kiss and tell her that somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would probably be impossible for him to reach a train which departed at ten-thirty for New York . " All my professional life , " he said grimly , " I 've been finding it necessary to be in one place when I wanted horribly to be in another . So does every other doctor . " " Yes , " agreed Sally . " And when you get to leaven all the angels will acquire obscure and frighteningpains , and you wo n't be able to get about to see the place until the day after to-morrow . " " When I get to heaven  --  " he replied  --  " if I do  --  my first request will be to have my telephone disconnectedfor the first thousand years . " " You 'd have it put in again at the end of the first week . But do n't worry about me , Uncle Red . I expectnothing less than that you will somehow manage to come tearing down to the train just in time to wave to me on the back platform . I 'll be looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll write you by the first mail . " " I 'll send you back a line from the ship . " " Good enough . "  |p71But  he did get there . Of course he did . Red had been making these close connections all his life . He did an unhurried operation , satisfied himself that his patient could be safely left in the hands of the hospitalstaff  --  and then cut every corner to get back to his office in time to go with Sally to the train . But Sally had already left . He was rushing from the house back to his car when a tall , slim figure met him . Hat off , deeply tanned face breaking into a delighted smile , Jefferson Shipley stood before him . For an instant Red did n't know him , in his tailored clothes , and was about to push by with a curt statement that he had n't a moment to lose and that the young man must look him up some other time , when an amused voice arrested him . " You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hurry , anyway . I 'd know you by that , anywhere . So I 'll just say I 'm Jeff Shipley , and I 'll come again . " " What ! Why , yes  --  of course ! " Red did stop stock-still , grasping the hard young hand . Then he smiled quite as broadly as Jeff.  | " Come along , " he said . " Jump in my car . " " Oh , I wo n't bother you now . " " Yes , you will . Get in . Do n't waste time , man . " They got in , one on either side . The car shot down the street . Jeff took off his flapping hat and held it in his hand . No use trying to keep it on when Dr. Burns was racing for anywhere . " I 'm going to see my niece off for New York . Sailingto-night for Liverpool . Maybe you knew her once . Sally Beaumont . " " Oh , " said Jeff , evidently searching his memory . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the youngsters who went to school with my sisters . . . . It seems awfully good to see you , Dr. Burns . " " When did you get back ? " " Two days ago . Been doing the long-lost son with the family . Rivers was home over the week end , and we 've done nothing but chin . " " That train 's either gone or late , " said Red , as they turned a bend in the road which led to the station , on the edge of town . " If she 's gone I 'll be out of luck . Tremendously fond of Sally , and had to dash off this morning with only time to kiss the tip of her ear as I went by her . There 'll he nobody to see her off from here , though there 'll be crowdP73enough at the pier . So I 'd rather like to . . . No , it has n't gone  --  there 's the row of taxicabs at the station . It is n't in sight  --  always can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing like gambling on train schedules . " He increased his speed . A motorcycle cop , coming up from behind , passed him with a friendly wave back . Red grinned . " It 's always supposed to be a matter of life and death with me , " he explained . " The times that chap has looked the other way would have lost him his badge if the town authorities were n't precisely as lenient . This car might be an ambulance or a fire engine ; that 's why I have an odd-sounding horn . If they mistake me they get the horn . " " It 's simply splendid to get hack to you , Dr. Burns , " Jeff Shipley chuckled . " Everything seems to be speeded up inside of me the minute I see you . " I ought to get over it  --  slow down . Ca n't seem to . It 's probably my hair . . . . Here we are , and I hope my Sally 's standing patiently on the other side of that station building . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me " beganJeff . But a stout arm through his walked him alongp74beside Red . All right  --  anything Dr. Burns insisted on . . . . Just to be with Dr. Burns Jeff would have gone anywhere . All the way from the house , no matter what else he said , Red had been turning over in his mind the question whether or not he should let Jeff know that this was the girl picked out for him , by request . For once in the life of this man of instant decisions , he was at a loss . There was no time to spin a coin into the air and then take precisely the opposite course from the one indicated by the fall of it  --  as is consistentlydone by most solitary spinners of coins . Should he  --  should n't he ? Meanwhile , here they were approaching Sally herself . . . . The first sight of her gave Red his cue  --  Jeff would n't need to be told beforehand to take note of her . He would n't be able to forget her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . She came to meet Red , her face radiant . She looked , said Red to himself , as adorable as she had ever looked in her life . He did n't know whether this was due to her traveling clothes , which gave her the sleek , poised appearance of the young woman who is so suitably dressed that she can entirely forget to wonder how she looks , or because she was reallyp75feeling free and happy in the thought of getting away and of joining a beloved friend for a new adventure . Anyhow , though by now it was only ten days since the episode which had changed everything in her future , she seemed barely a first cousin to the girl Red had watched in the church from behind his pillar . A whimsical thought flashed into his mind : all that cream she had been fed while staying at his home had n't been wasted ; the little hollow in her cheeks had been filled out , her eyes were clear . She was his Sally once more , the most appealing girl he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That train could n't be far away . Jeff and Sally looked at each other with apparent interest  --  as why should n't they ?  --  and spoke of the days when they had slightly known each other . Jeff mentioned Rivers , his older brother . " Oh , yes , " said Sally , " I remember him , but I was so much younger than he that he 'd never remember me . Terribly good-looking and sought after , was n't he ? At my age he seemed to me like quite a god among young men . " " Yes , Rivers seemed that way to me , too . I 've never got over it . It was rather a shock when I cameP76home the other day , after two years in the wilds , to find my brother not talking the language of the gods at all , nor looking at me as though I were a barking pup , but being just an everyday good brother with all sorts of cares and worries . I 'd never supposed he could have any . He actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his problems . Not that my opinion was worth anything , but I was very much flattered . And it made me feel that I 'd really grown up . " " You look very much grown up , " Sally assured him . Red strolled away . Yet he immediately strolled back again . He must n't seem to be throwing them together . Jeff would n't take the opportunity to say : " Now that I have met you I know what I 've been looking for , " or anything like that , and propose gettingmarried before the ship should sail . They were n't going to meet again . As Red glanced at the pair he saw nothing to indicate that they wanted to fall into each other 's arms at first sight . He came up and began to talk , himself , so that Sally would turn toward him and Jeff could note that really beautifulprofile of hers . Yet what was the use of all his scheming , with the train . . . Yes , it was comingp77now , would be here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . " Good-bye , Uncle Red . Give my very dearest love to Aunt Ellen , and write to me soon .

" Red scrawled it on a leaf of his prescription book . " Good-bye , Mr. Shipley . I hope you 'll enjoy your vacation in the States after all that Canadian experience . Yes , porter  --  those two bags . " " Good-bye , Miss Beaumont . Hope you have a fine summer in South Devon . " The stop , being a suburban , had n't lasted more than sixty seconds . The train was already moving . Sally stood in the vestibule , looking down , waving at them . Then she was gone , and Red and Jeff turned away . They walked back in silence to the waiting car . " Come home with me ? We can have a good visit now , if I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just back to the house with you , if I may . I left my car parked round the corner . Ca n't stay , this time . Just drove over in a hurry from our place  --  got to be back to take a girl I know intop78town for luncheon and a matinee . But I wanted just to get a look at you , Dr. Burns . It 's simply swell to be seeing old friends . Some day I hope we can have a good talk . " " I hope we can , " agreed Red , with an odd glance . " I thought you  --  well  --  I thought you did n't want to lose any time about that talk ? " Jeff laughed . " A fine , sentimental letter I wrote you , did n't I ? Wrote that one evening when the moonlight had got me . Daylight 's another thing , eh ? You must have thought you had to dry-nurse a baby , when you read that letter . " " You do n't look much like a baby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Funny how one 's notions change , is n't it ? My one idea now is to have a jolly time while I 'm here and then go back , still a care-free bachelor . Dorry Morton says she 'll give me all the fun I want , so we 've taken each other on for the summer . She 's just about the liveliest thing I could ask for . Used to know her , but had forgotten what a good sport she could be . Mighty pretty , too . . . So  --  you do n't have to have me on your mind , and I 'm sorry I bothered you with my wails about loneliness . Forget ' em if you can . Just the same , I do want to tell you all about the big con/struction up there in the Northwest and show you a whole raft of pictures and prints , if you care to see ' em .

He hustled the car over the road , and presently was saying good-bye to Jeff as he sat at the wheel of a very smart open roadster which he said was lent him by his brother Rivers for the period of his stay . He looked the picture of that care-free bachelor , behind that wheel , with his hat-brim flapping in the breeze , and the cigarette he was about to light between his fingers . . . . Dorry Morton . . . what would n't she do with this new playmate , eager for a jolly time and thinking he did n't want to marry for a long while yet !

Thanks a lot for letting me drive to the station with you . May I ring you up some evening and ask for an hour with you ? " " Of course . When my wife is back we 'll have you over for dinner some night , if it wo n't be too dull for you. , , " I should say it would n't be . Nothing 's dull for me . Could n't be ! Why , Dr. Burns , I get a great kick out of just turning the corner on two wheels to dodge the traffic . Traffic 's increased forty per cent since I went away . I know I 'm a fool over it all . . . .

Red went into the house , feeling decidedly depressed . Sally was gone , Ellen would n't be back till day after to-morrow . . . . He went into his big square room , picked up a medical magazine from his desk , disposed himselfRED PEPPER RETURNS 81P81on his couch , and plunged into an article he had noted before . The title would seem to indicate that the subject was one well adapted to his case . It was : " Common Errors in Diagnosis in Cases Showing Symptoms of Cardiac Lesions . " " Now , dear , I 'm ready to hear all about it  --  if you 're ready to tell me . Of course I 'm immensely interested . " Ellen had finished her unpacking , had had dinner with her husband , and had come upstairs with him into that big square upper room of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She seldom invaded it , otherwise . That was one of her theories about married life which had long ago proven its wisdom ; a busy man coming home for rest should have one place there which belonged to him exclusively  --  not merely theoretically , with everybody coming into it , offering one excuse or another  --  ornone at all  --  because it was so comfortable , livable , and withdrawn . As a result , Red was always insisting on his wife 's joining him there , as now.  | He sat beside her on the roomy couch , his pipe lighted . He had already told her some dozen times how glad he was to have her back , and had demonstratedit . After all , though he had enjoyed having Sally Beaumont about , even a girl like that could n't touch his wife for satisfying companionship , he thought . Ellen was a picture to-night , anyhow , in her simple dinner dress of the gray-blue she loved best to wear , with a smoky necklace of lusterless blue crystals dropping from neck to lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his letters during her absence . It would have taken too many sheets . So now lie told it to her in his own concise and graphic fashion , without much wasting of words . She listened , her dark eyes and mobile face showing now surprise , now amusement , and again a touch of concern . But she was smiling as Red finished and glanced round at her . He had been looking straight ahead as he talked , with occasional pauses to revive the draught in a pipe which seemed to be acting badly . " Well ? " he questioned . " I suppose the whole thing sounds as crazy to you as it does now to me  --  I admit it . But , nevertheless , I 'm not sorry for one minute that I stopped that wedding . "   " Neither am I. You are probably the only person in the world who would have thought it could be done , at the last minute , or would have had the courage to do it  --  unless there were really  --  what do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If there was n't cause for action I do n't know what would have been .

We shall never understand how she could have been willing to marry Phil . " " Easy enough . Your own sister " " Yes , Evelyn is incurably sentimental , and she was determined that Sally should make what was to Evelyn herself an advantageous marriage . But I 'm glad I was n't here . You were perfectly equal to the situation yourself . You say Sally was looking well when she went away ? Nothing could have been betterfor her than a stay in South Devon with that intelligentand stimulating woman , Elizabeth Stuart . Sally will come back with a perfectly sane outlook upon life , and she 'll never make such a mistake as that again . " " No  --  I hope not . But I have n't told you the whole story , even yet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned it toward her , rather like that of a schoolboy who is coming to the worst of a confession he has bravely started out to make . " Not yet ? Do go on . I have a suspicion , dearest , that you 've been getting into mischief . " She did n't look as though it worried her . She was quite used to hearing of the extraordinary things that it suddenly occurred to her resourceful and impulsive husband to do . She would n't have him otherwise . Never had her married life been dull , nor would it ever be so for lack of surprises of one sort or another . " I have . But I do n't think I 've done any harm . I 've merely proved myself once again an incurable producer of the dramatic and unexpected . Never shall get over it . " " I hope you never will . " So he told this second story , of Jeff Shipley and his letter and the photograph , and of the complete failure of his own plans . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she had a. hard time of it , and her soft , uncontrollable laughter as he finished with the portrait of Jeff **28;693;TOOLONG to Dorothea Morton while Sally sailed away out of reach , neither of them having appeared to take any ' special note of each other , made Red sit up in mock despair . " Yes , I knew you 'd laugh at me . I 'm an old blunderer , thinking I can pull the strings and make the puppets dance . All I 've done is to play into the hands of that young imp , Dorry Morton . She 'll make a fool of Jeff , see if she does n't . " " I do n't believe she 's so dangerous , Red . Just a staccato young thing having all the fun she can . " " Is n't she , though ! She 's the sort that takes hus. bands away from wives . Not so young , either  --  old enough to be plenty dangerous . Maybe I do n't know dynamite when I see it . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . A loud explosion . " " I thought you said it was Phil Filmore she " Not when she gets a sight of Jeff . Any girl would throw a Filmore over at the altar to marry a Shipley . If you do n't believe it , just recall Phil 's doughy features and then look at this . " He took down the framed photograph from the wall and gave it into his wife 's hands . She studied it carefully. 86 RED PEPPER RETURNS " He does look very unusual and interesting . So does the other young man , in a different way . But I do n't see how you can do anything more about it . You ca n't go around warning these boys and girls whom not to marry and then presenting them with more desirable alliances . You see , you 're so used to issuing orders Red groaned . " Yes , I see . And I give this case up . As a matter of fact , I do n't care a hang now who marries anybody . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now I can settle down and say a few things to my wife that have been accumulating duringthe month and that I could n't get on paper . . . . After all , darling . . . " But before he said them he got up and closed the door . Those intimate things he wanted to say were not to be overheard by any curious maid lurking in the hall outside . He had caught the soft sound of footsteps , and he understood curious human nature all too well . JEFF did come to dinner , upon invitation ; did talk about the big job in Canada ; did n't say a word about girls ! He seemed the exact opposite of theP87young man who had written Red of his hope to find a possible wife . It was as though , as he himself had said , he felt he had in that letter unwarrantably shown a soft and emotional side of his nature to a man who , while he would n't laugh at him , would nevertheless think considerably less of him for manifestingit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional or soft . It was great fun to be back , he said , but after all he would n't mind in the least when the time should be up , and the Canadian Pacific bearing him off to the edge of the wilds again . It was a great adventure , and it was n't counting time out of his life in the very least to be spending his early twenties in this way . If it were only to be with Leslie Warden . . . and he again expressed his admiration for the Englishman , seeming to be unable to rate him too high or present him too attractively to his own friends . " I wanted most awfully to bring him home with me , since he 's rather unattached , from what he says , to any special place . His family are scattered , he merely goes back to England as Englishmen seem to  --  out of sheer fondness for their country . But he would n't come , and countered by asking me there with him , to go on a walking trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , like the postman who spent his holiday on a nice long hike . Now I  --  the more and faster miles I can cover in my brother 's motor while I 'm here the better . I may temporarily lose some hardness from the muscles in my calves , but I 'm making that up in getting everywhere I want to go and seeing everything I want to see . Blame me , Dr. Burns ? " " Hardly , Jeff . Go to it , with my blessing . Well do I know what fast miles mean to youth  --  and even more to middle age , if you 'll believe it . " Jeff looked at him , laughing . " Middle age ! If ever I saw youth it 's in your face . You 'll never grow old . " " Wo n't I , though ! And why should I want to be a case of arrested development ? I do n't . Every year I grow richer in experience . I 'm willing to pay for it with all the signs of age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of age , " laughed Jeff . " Oh , yes , it is . A sort of last whirl , in the air , before the sere and yellow leaf falls to the ground . " . Both Ellen and Jeff were much amused by this , asanyone who looked at Red was bound to be . Thedinner proceeded with much lively talk , but not aP89word did Red hear to satisfy his curiosity as to his protege 's doings . When Jeff shook hands , saying good-night , he appeared to realize that he was being unexpectedly reticent and made up for it with one grave little speech . " Dr. Burns , I thought I 'd want to tell everybody everything , when I came home . Perhaps it 's the influenceof Leslie , who tells nobody anything , but I seem to have crawled into a sort of shell while I 've been here . That does n't seem to fit with what I 've said about wanting to see and do everything while I have the chance . But , on my word , I 'm seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which must be on wheels . . . . Somehow , I ca n't explain . . . . " " I think I can , Jeff . Your real heart is in your job in the Northwest . You 're here almost as an outsider , and you did n't expect to feel that way . I congratulate you on work that absorbs you like that . Other things can come later . Go back , and thank the Lord for your enthusiasm over important interests . They 're the sort you need most now . " Jeff gave his hand a terrific pressure -- which testifiedto the fact that no muscles of his had lost their power in these few weeks of vacation  --  and went away . He said he would come again . So he did , but90 RED PEPPER RETURNSnot until just before he went back to Canada . The short visit , when it took place , was one to be remembered . P90MEANWHILE , there were occasional letters from Sally Beaumont , in South Devon . She was having  --  at first  --  a quiet , peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Miss Stuart , or motoring with her in a tiny English car . Then the letters changed in tone : things were n't , apparently , quite so peaceful , but had become decidedlymore amusing . She had n't time to say much , there were so many plans on foot . They were seeing a good deal of a number of Miss Stuart 's charming English friends , who were asking them for weekendshere and there at pleasant country places . Miss Stuart had so many friends . . . . Then came the letter which sent Red straight up into the air : at first in a rage of disappointment . Then , as he calmed down under Ellen 's gayly teasing comments , he began to accept the situation , and finally to agree that it 's probably better not to try too hard to arrange other people 's affairs for them , for the simple reason that it generally ca n't bep91done . In the end . . . but it was Jeff who had to do with that ending . Meanwhile , Red was reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement : " You wo n't believe it , and maybe you 'll be quite shocked , but that wo n't do you any harm , Uncle Red  --  you 've been shocking people all your life . I 'm to be married to-morrow , here at Miss Elizabeth 's cottage , to Leslie Warden . You must know a lot about him through your friend Jeff Shipley . It was Jeff who introduced us . He wrote to me , and he wrote to Leslie , who has been staying  --  he has no home now  --  not far away at a little country inn . You remember I saw his photograph at your house , and something about his face , as I noticed it even then , made me remember him . When he came to call he brought Jeff 's letter . Since then I 've seen other letters of Jeff 's , telling Leslie that when he saw me at the station and learned that I was going to South Devon , it seemed to him that if we two could meet . . . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conspiracy ? . . . Leslie is thirtytwoand has led rather a lonely life ; Jeff was con- vinced that he should marry . Leslie 's very fond of , Jeff  --  says he 's such a nice boy . He really must be , though I did n't notice him much at the station . I was so anxious to spend the last few minutes just with you that I rather resented his being there . Of course , I 'm glad enough now that he was . " I hope you do n't think this is all too hasty . Miss Stuart does n't , even though I 'm going straight back with Leslie , landing at Quebec and taking the Canadian Pacific across to the place where we go is by airplane . I 'm not a bit afraid of the rough life  --  Leslie 's made it sound as rough as he could , to scare me . It will be a relief to be on such a new adventure , and  --  I do n't mind putting this in , for your and Aunt Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much that anywhere with him would be the perfect place for me . He 's the real , real thing , you see . " I 've written Mother to ask her to run up to Quebec and meet us  --  I hope she will .

Uncle Red , I can never be grateful enough to you for saving me from the most awful . mistake I could have made  --  saving me for this . I 've told Leslie the whole story , and he says I ca n't be half as grateful to you as he is. "  |p93Red  laid down the letter . " The next time I gamble , " he said , " it wo n't be on the favorite , but on some long-legged , rangy dark horse . " IT WAS only a day later that Jeff Shipley pulled up his car at the Burns 's curb and dashed in . He had a letter in his hand as he was ushered into that upstairsroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellen , smiling , put out a friendly hand . " " I see you have a letter , " Red said . " Yes . Have you ? " " I believe there 's been one , that we 've read several times over . It was an interesting letter . Is yours the mate to it ? " " Of course . Is n't it the greatest news you ever had ? " Jeff 's face was beaming . Red scanned him closely . " So you 're pleased ? " " Pleased ! I 'm quite off my head about it . Good Lord , I made the match ! I did it with my good American nerve . The minute I saw that girl on the platform and heard she was going to South Devon I thought of Leslie . Somehow she looked to me exactly the girl for him . "  | " But not for yourself ?

" He did look younger  --  much younger , for some reason , than when he had first come home . He was a nice boy , no doubt of it  --  but he was still a boy . Sally had had enough of boys ; she should have a , man . Evidently she now had one . " Yes , I imagine you 've kept afloat , " said Ellen .

" Jeff caught sight of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down , brought it over to Ellen , and sat upon the couch beside her . " Dr. Burns has done us a lot of honor , " he commented , " sticking us up there . . . . Have you looked hard at Leslie , Mrs. Burns ? Can you getp95just what he 's like ? Of course you ca n't , but it 's there . Your Sally will be as safe with him  --  and as happy . . . . Wait 611 1 get out there too . I 'll report back on the case . I promise you my eyes 'll be wide open . " " See here , " said Red . " It just suddenly strikes me that your friend Warden was engaged to anothergirl  --  was to marry her . How about it ? Is n't that being off and on again rather rapidly ? " " It may seem so , " Jeff admitted . " When he got home he found she 'd just married another man  --  somebody who would n't ask her to go out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did n't reach him before he sailed . I do n't think the blow hit him very hard ; she 'd held him off a long time . And when he saw Sally  --  well " Caught on the rebound , as the ancient saying has it , " commented Red . Sally too , he said to himself . And sometimes the rebound turned out better than the original throw . " I 'm sure it 's all right , " Jeff assured him . " I have an idea it is . When are you going ? " " About a fortnight after they do . " " Do n't you think you 'll be envious ? " " Envious ? More than likely . Yet  --  to tell the truth . . . "   " You 'd better , " commanded Red . " After all the pondering and anxious thought I put into your case before you came home . " " Oh , did you ? What a letter that must have been ! . . . Well , then  --  Leslie 's having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen her picture . Les made me promise by all that 's crazy that I 'd wait till I 'd seen her before I . . . In fact , she and I 've had some correspondence  --  awfully interesting . So . . . " " I 'll advise you on one thing , " said Red . " Do n't decide anything  --  anything  --  that has to do with your future , on a moonlight night in spring . " " No , " promised Jeff , " I wo n't . That is  --  if I can help it . You ca n't sit indoors with them on moonlight nights . They always want to be taken out . " " Take her out , " suggested Red , " when it 's rainingand you both have to wear rubber boots . " " Do you really think that would make any difference ? " inquired Jeff , with an engaging cock of the eyebrow " No  --  and God bless you , " said Red . His eyebrow was cocked too.  |p97LETTER  from Dr. Burns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern Italy . DEAR ANNE : It 's good news about your mending injuries , but I ca n't say I 'm pleased with your putting on ten pounds of weight . That comes from having to lie in bed and not being forced to restrain your appetite . Do n't I know what your trays are like , you having the means to pay for any extras that take your fancy ? Cut down the sweets , Anne  --  cut ' em down till it hurts ! You 're too young still to be willingto waddle when you get about again , and anyhow , for one of your physical type , that way lie Bright 's disease and other insidious ills , too frequently heralded by just that plump pink-andwhitenesswhich is so attractive till it gets out of hand . Hear me ? flll right , my dear . But heed me , also  --  I vow you must , with this prolonged physical inactivity to help the bad work along . Well , I suspect I made several kinds of an ass of myself , trying to steer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what looks like a promising marriage for her , though not to the man I picked for the part . When it came down to it she did her own picking , which was as it should be , and the Red Peppers of this world should learn a lesson by it . Parents , too . Why should I be so anxious to get a girl married after getting her out of it ? Am I an incorrigible romanticist , in spite of all I know to make me cynical ? It must be because there 's no use in ignoring the laws of human existence and its perpetuation . But , you know , flnne , it 's rather a terrible thing to try to handle other lives , in any way . A red-head like me is always tempted to use the power he has over people to make them do what he thinks is the thing for them . Suppose he succeeds . Suppose I 'd managed to get Sally tied up to the wrong man . I know I was right in pulling her loose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempting to bring about a combination that looked fine and promising to me was what I should n't have done  --  and I 'll probably try to do it the next time I yet a chance ! Now , here are you , writing me about Dick 's supposed " desertion " of you , leaving you to recuperate in that sanitarium while he goes off on that expedi-'ion with a bunch of men instead of on the trip you'dp99planned to take together . You want to know what I think of it . So here 's another opportunity for me to mix myself up in other people 's affairs by telling you what I do think of it  --  as of course I shall . I think it 's all right , old girl . lie could n't do much for you if he were there , and you 've trotted around so much together all these years , it may be a good thing to let him loose for the three months your doctors say are going to be necessary . You see , your and Dick 's case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No children , plenty of money , both of you fond of dashing about , etc. you 've really done more things together in ten years than . the average married pair do in a lifetime . But they 've all been conventional things , Anne , do you realize it ? You 've lived a **46;723;TOOLONG . Even when you 're at home ( do you know the meaning of the word ? ) you 're in an apartment hotel , with everything done for you . Your travel has all been of the luxurious type . You 've never roughed it for a day  --  no , I swear you have n't , my dear girl . I know you think you have , but it 's been with servants and camels and caravans to transport you . Now , for once , old Dick has gone of to try how it seems to be wherezoo RED PEPPER RETURNSp100white flannels , dinner coats , and top hats ( I do n't mean worn all at the same time ! ) wo n't be needed . I 'll bet he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of stuff he 'll discard , of course . He 'll be anotherDick when he joins up with you again  --  and I have an idea you 'll be another Anne . This is the first time you 've ever had to lie by in your gay life , is n't it ? Maybe you and Dick will try something new ' together , some day . Settling down for part of the year in a house of your own  --  perhaps adopting a child . Yes , I know I 'm on dangerous ground , Sis . But while you have all this spare time to think things over , think that possibility over . You know , it would be mighty hard for Ellen and me to say which we love the most , adopted Bob , the dear rascal , or Betsy and Nancy , who are really ours . We might never have had a son of our own . A calamity that would have been , too . Well , I 've got to run over and see Max Buller . Remember Max , the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not your sort . He 's my best friend , in the profession or out of it , after Jack Leaver , and he 's been overworking for so long he 's almost committingsuicide . I 'm worried about him . I 'm not worried about you  --  if you promise to cut out those sweets . RED PEPPER RETURNS totP101I 'll wager there 's a box of chocolates on the table by your bed this minute , eh , Anne ? If there is , give them to the nurses  --  they need energy if they 're looking after you ! I 'm dodging the book you 're throwing  --  you ca n't hit me . Good-night , Anne , dear . RED . P102I WISH , Dr. Burns , " said Mr. George Graham , taking final leave of his surgeon as he left the hospitalfor his big black motor waiting outside , " you would let me do something for you besides thisah  --  fee . I 'm sorry you would n't let me make it larger . You have earned " Oh , never mind , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office sign read  --  " you 've given me a lot of fun . Your case  --  man , there 've been barely a dozen of them in the history of surgery . I 'm no end grateful to you for getting that peculiar and enormously interesting pain of yours almost outside my office door . Think of it  --  rushing through this town as you were in your car  --  never here before  --  probablynever here again  --  you had the generosity to a perfect stranger to double up into a hard knot as you did right here and nowhere else . Why , I ought to do something for you --  " You can , " interposed Mr. Graham , grasping his opportunity , as he was accustomed to do . That wasP103what made him a competent executive in his own world of business affairs . He did n't look the part . He was a thin little man of fifty or so , perfectly dressed , but with no special air of authority about him  --  unless you caught him in his chair at the head of a board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that quiet , almost hesitating way of his , the others invariably listened , and with reason . They were usually sorry when they had n't . " How can I ? " Burns inquired suspiciously . He scented philanthropy , and he would have none of it as concerned himself . " I have a camp in the hills , " said Mr. Graham , " not fifty miles from here . I 'm not going to use it this season . The weather is growing hot  --  it will be hotter . You need a rest  --  all doctors do , according to my observation . If you would do me the honor " " One of those gilt-edged camps , I suppose , " suggestedBurns , with a friendly but distrustful smile . " Silk quilts on the beds , and bathrooms all over the place . " " The silk quilts can be put away and red blankets substituted , if you prefer . It 's just a comfortable , good-sized cabin , and not at all gilt-edged , as youp104think , Dr. Burns . It can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow me to wire " Burns was about to shake his head , explaining that he needed no vacation . Then , suddenly , he thought of his friend , Dr. Maxwell Buller . There was a man who did . If this Graham really meant it . . . He inquired into it carefully . When he and his late patient parted , the thing was all arranged . The slender executive and the hair-trigger surgeon had seen eye to eye concerning the welfare of Burns 's best friend in the profession , the hardest working , most vacationless , nearest worn-out physician the village had . " I shall take great pleasure , " said Mr. Graham , in his quiet , soft-voiced way , " in thinking of Dr. Buller 's occupying the camp . And if you , Dr. Burns , will spend some time there with him . . . " " I 'll have to , " Burns admitted . " The old dog would n't stay there a week if I did n't . He 'd limp back after me  --  maybe die on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had heard tales from his nurses as to Dr. Burns 's working himself to death . Vigorous as he still seemed in the middle forties , they were afraid they 'd some dayP105lose him . Mr. Graham had gathered that no calamity could hit the hospital at which the red-headed surgeon was chief operator , like that . BURNS had a tussle with Maxwell Buller . Buller had been the man who had had to deal a smashing blow to Red , at the time of the Great War , by telling him a tale about his heart . Which organ , though good enough , more than likely , for years more of work  --  he was then thirty-three  --  would n't get by the inquiring stethoscopes of the examiners at the recruiting stations . The tables had been turned : it was now Red who had to tell Buller a few things neither of them liked to mention . " But I ca n't get away , Red . " " You 've got to get away , Max . " " I ca n't . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old John Nevers  --  the Brewstertwins " You 're going . " Red Pepper picked up Buller 's telephone . And at that particular moment , as though NatureIo6 RED PEPPER RETURNSp106took a hand in the argument , Buller suddenly went gray in the face , and his friend Burns had to do some quick work upon him . Which settled it . Buller had hoped Red would never catch him in one of those moments of collapse from overfatigue , but now he had , and it was the end of the discussion . " NICE place , " said Red , lighting his pipe . " Not my idea of a camp , exactly , but then these bankers have no idea of doing anything halfway or even a quarter way . None too soft for you , though , Max . " Buller looked about him , from where he lay in a sort of glorified deck chair , all cushions and comfort . The two were upon the long porch which looked off into the dark summer night . Not a light to , be seen anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the lower country to-day , according to the evening paper , which Brown , the camp caretaker , had lately brought up . It could n't be more than a mild eighty here . And a little breeze blowing which made it seem cooler . " I 've given in to you , Red , " said Buller , " because I do n't seem to be able to fight you . "  | " People usually ca n't , " Red chuckled . Concerned though he was over Buller , he had immensely enjoyed putting through the business of getting him up here . It had taken less than a week to bring it all about . " But I still do n't feel right because your wife and children are n't here . " " Will you quit that ? Ellen herself told you they a lot preferred the seaside  --  were all set to go , anyway . What those youngsters would do if they could n't tumble around in the water , I do n't know They 're all settled in . Bob 's crazy over getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two small ' uns took along enough shovels to dig up the entire coast line . As for Len  --  it 's a good thing for her to get away from her Red-head for a while  --  and me from her , if you want to know it . " Buller looked around at his friend in amazement . Red laughed . " Say it , " he commanded . Buller could n't say it . He was n't married himself  --  never had been . To him Red and Ellen Burns were the most successfully married couple he had ever known , and he had n't known many he could call that . Mrs. Burns  --  well  --  he had never discovered anybody like her . Still young and lovely at  --  sheio8 RED PEPPER RETURNSp108must be in the late thirties  --  and charming past description . He understood beyond a doubt that Red was devoted to her  --  no man in his senses would n't be . Buller had envied Red all these years  --  and Red was the only man he had envied . " What an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dyed-in-the-wool bachelor , and then shocked beyond expression because I say a thing like that . Why , man , the life and breath of marriage are the temporary separations in it . Every so often , ever since we 've been married , Len packs her trunk and goes off down South , where she came from . I hate like the devil to see her go , because the Lord knows I never get enough of her in the intervals between patients . But that makes no difference with her . Away she goes , stays a month , perhaps , and comes back . When she gets off the train and I see those black eyes of hers again  --  well  --  I go mad with joy , precisely as I did that day so long ago , when I marriedher . And  --  let me tell you  --  since I know what you 're saying to yourself this minute  --  it 's only partly because she brings with her the faintest , subtlest sort of a breath of fragrance , one I associate with the very beginnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  complete again . I 'm allP109there when she comes home  --  and only half there when she 's away . " A deep sigh from the stretched-out shadow in the darkness which was Maxwell Buller was the answer to these descriptions of something he knew , by personalexperience , nothing about . Red heard it and responded instantly and characteristically : " The devil take me for saying that sort of thing to you , old boy . " " I do n't mind what you say to me , Red . Go on . I like to hear anything you 'll tell me . I  --  you know it is n't often , all these years , we 've had any chance to sit down and talk about anything except patients  --  cases . . . " It was quite true . The two men had been the best friends in the world , standing by each other through all sorts of emergencies , crises , such as constantly occur in their profession . Red had fought Buller 's battles ; Buller had in his quiet fashion defendedRed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the operating field , had been unfair to him . " I know we have n't . We 've got to make up now . Lord , what I owe you ! I 'll never forget what I thought about you , Max , when I first came to townno RED PEPPER RETURNSp110and into your office . Most of the other fellows I 'd called on  --  funny etiquette , is n't it , to have to go around and present yourself to all the other doctors and tell ' em you 're hanging out your shingle  --  most of them were cool and condescending . But you  --  I picked you out for a father right then , though you could n't have been more than a year or so older . " " The reason why they were cool was because you looked dangerous , Red . You did , even to me , though I liked you . I knew you were going to be " Buller hesitated . " Cock o ' the walk ? Yes , I suppose , even then , when I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made me fit to take charge of everything , I must have looked and acted like a young madman . " Red laughed , thrusting his fingers through his thick hair . " And I was one . The surgical stunts I dared attempt  --  the very thought of some of them makes me cold now . " " Now  --  when you 're still doing twice as com-plicated " I have my technique now  --  that 's different . And conditions are different . But then  --  I was a daredevil . I do n't know how I got away with as much of it as I did . Many 's the time I 've come home toP111Ellen , so sick at heart I could only bury my head in . . . And next morning went out with that same red head in the air . . . . But that 's enough about me . I 've learned a few things . " " That red head will always be in the air . " " I suppose so . " " I wish , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel like it  --  a little more about your married life , Red . I 've been on the outside looking in so long . " " You ought to have married , yourself , Max . Lord only knows why you have n't . " " Yes , " said Buller  --  he could n't talk about why he had n't married  --  " I suppose the Lord , if He took any interest , was the only one who did know . " " How do we know He did n't take an interest ? " Red inquired promptly . " You know , Max , say what they will  --  some of ' em  --  I ca n't get away from that idea . I read their stuff , and now and then it gets me , and I tell myself we do n't know anything  --  never can know anything  --  fools to think we do , and most of us do n't think it , anyhow . And then something happens to make me feel that a bit of solid belief is a lot more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's something to hang onto . " PII2Buller did n't answer , but his pale face , turned toward Red , bore an expression of gratitude . Said Red to himself , " That 's enough of that . Must n't preach at him  --  he 'll think I think he 's in need of a priest . " So he went on in a hurry . " My married life ? It 's a wonder any woman could put up with it , eh ? I 've slowed down a lot now . " " Yes ? " Buller had to question that . It was he who had many a time urged the slowing down , only to have his advice set aside . " Yes , I have , you old tyrant , and you know it . Ellen 's seen to that . She 's the artfullest woman you ever knew , behind all that sweet calm of hers . She can be the Balm of Gilead and the Spices of Araby , but she can also back me into a corner in this matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my way out of it  --  not till I 've given in . " Buller turned his head away , so the light from inside the window did n't fall on his face . " Ca n't kiss my way out of it . " What a phrase to start a poor fellow 's imagination . Many a night he had lain awake , thinking and thinking of the one woman who , since he had known her , had become really the only one of whom he had ever thought with anP113overpowering longing . That longing , in all these years he had been Red 's friend , had never ceased to torment him . And he had never , by word or act or look  --  when anyone could observe him  --  betrayed . himself . It was n't in his stern code that he should . There are such men  --  a very few . Maxwell Buller was one of them . Plain , intelligent face , shoulders a little stooped with care , manner all but shy where women were concerned , but courageous to the depths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , after all , was as nearly pure gold as could be found among men . And Red knew it , but he would never know the other thing . As for Ellen . . . But they did n't talk any more about Red 's marriedlife that night . Red discovered that it was late andbundled Max off to bed . He all but tucked him in , in the luxurious single bed in one of the smallerguest rooms , evidently intended for bachelors . Redwas glad of the luxury when it came to beds . Hedid n't suppose Buller had ever taken the time ortrouble to renew springs or mattress on his own ; Red had no doubt at all that the crazy old springsp114and the depression worn in the mattress let the occupant down so that he could all but feel the oldfashionedslats . Buller had been too busy to bother , and he had had no wife to tell him that he might be more comfortable . His office equipment was what it should be , but that was as far as his expenditures went . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . " Pretty soft , eh ? " questioned Red , when he had seen his friend under the light blanket which was all the night required up here in the mountains . He actually did want to tuck the blanket in , but forebore. 1 Ie noted with a trained eye how poor a color it was in the face against the white pillow . " So soft I 'm afraid I sha n't stay awake long enough to appreciate it . " " Do n't . You could n't do Mr. George Graham a greater favor  --  nor me , either . Good-night , and do n't be asinine enough to pull out for breakfast . I shall probably sleep late myself . " " You 'll be up with the dawn , " murmured Buller , with another of his involuntary deep sighs . Red closed the door , shutting a portion of his heart inside . Why did it have to be his best friend who was in such shape as this ? Why could n't itp115have been Grayson or Fields or some of the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Max Buller 's little finger for real worth . They played tricks in and with the profession . Buller would n't condescend to some of their tactics . So it was he who had to get knocked out  --  and what did they care ? Not a thing . But Red cared so much that he went out and walked the porch for an hour before he went to bed , thinking and thinking , ' with his teeth clamped down hard on the stem of a pipe which had gone out unnoticed five minutes after he had lighted it . . . . " YOU 'RE wanted on the telephone , Dr. Burns . " Burns got up . He and Buller had been sitting out on the pine-needle-strewed ground in the sunshine . The heat had moderated considerably , and the smell of the balsams had lured them . They had been in camp nearly a week now , and Red had persuaded himself that Buller looked a shade less like a sick man . " Familiar sound , " the red-head growled , as he had growled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire left in up here if I dared cut my family off from being able to call me. " ii6 RED PEPPER RETURNSp116He went inside . Buller , lying comfortably in his cushioned deck chair , smiled to himself . It was n't the family who called Red , it was Red who called the family , every night . He could always be heard booming away , imagining probably that he could n't be heard outside the room where he was talking . Wanted to know all about what they were doing . Wanted to know if they needed anything . . . . He was booming now . Impossible not to hear . How well Max knew Red 's way of responding . He could never get the preliminaries to a long distance call through fast enough , no matter which end of it he was on . " What ? . . . This is Graham 's camp . . . . Yes . . . . Burns  --  yes . . . . All right  --  all right  --  I 'm ready . . . . Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A short interval , punctuated by Red 's startled exclamations . " What ? . . . What ? . . . No ! . . . Oh , God ! . . . But she 's all right ? Bob  --  she 's all right ? . . . Are you all right ? . . . What time did it happen ? . . . No bad reaction  --  sure ? . . . Why in heaven 's name did n't you call me before ? . . . No , of course , you could n't . . . . You did exactly right , onlyAp117I . . . Bob , I 'm coming . . . coming like lightning . . . starting one minute from now . . . . Good-bye , old fellow . . . . I 'm proud of you . . . . Yes . . . . Yes ! No , tell her I wo n't break my neck getting there  --  but I 'll get there . Must see her  --  and you . . . . Good-bye ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , so to speak , every red hair on Burns 's head was electric . Buller had got out of his chair to go to meet him when he heard directions being given inside to Brown . " Take good care of Dr. Buller . I 'll probably be back by night , but do n't let him have a lonesome day . Tell him some fishing stories . See he has his eggs and milk and orange juice  --  pour ' em into him . " Then , outside , Red running down the steps , hatless , pulling on his gray flannel coat as he came . His tanned face flushed , his eyes , as Max had seen them so often , like hazel lights . " Ca n't stop to tell you  --  they 're all right  --  Ellen and Bob . Only I have got to see them  --  make sure . Back to-night , I think , or to-morrow , at the latest . . . . You do n't mind ? " ii8 RED PEPPER RETURNS " Of course not . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I But Red was off . Leaping into the roadster which had been standing near the porch  --  he had been starting for the mail shortly  --  he had got the motor going with a roar and had disappeared around a bend in the steep hill road before Buller had finished the few words he had tried to say . Precisely as of old . Nobody would have believed the man was forty-five . Ile did n't look it  --  did n't act it  --  was n't forty-five  --  could n't be . Buller , only a year or two older , felt ninety by comparison . Yet , as for experience , Redfield Pepper Burns had already packed a lifetime of it into his forty-five dynamic /years . Compared with him , Buller seemed to himselfhardly to have lived at all . He had an anxious day , in spite of the assurance that everybody was " all right . " That was the sort of thing always said to invalids , but the rushing to get to the place where something had happenedrather negatived the reassurance . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell by that . It was early evening when Red came back . Buller had had all the lights put on in the cabin 's largep119central room and was waiting there . He heard the powerful motor come up the steep , winding hill through the woods  --  a low purr , but plainly audible in the night air . He went to the door and stood there . The car came into view , three people in it . Brown went to meet it . Buller was pretty shaky because of the worried day he had spent ; he hoped everything really was all right . He watched the three get out of the car  --  Red and two others . They walked slowly up the path , and their faces grew visible in the light from the house : Ellen , with Red and their son Bob on either side of her . Both had their arms through hers , though she seemed to be walking steadily enough . Both were looking down at her as though there were nothing else to look at . For herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and saw Dr. Maxwell Buller standing in the doorway , the light behind him , his face hardly perceivable , but the lines of his figure the lank ones she knew . His attitude was one which suggested weakness , for he leaned against the doorpost as though to steady himself . She spoke to him , in the clear , low tones which always thrilled him  --  hici , who was supposed to know no thrills , only plain work and duty and routine. xao RED PEPPER RETURNS " How nice to see you here , Dr. Buller , " she said . " And I assure you all this escorting by my husband and son is quite unnecessary  --  though very pleasant . " She was smiling up at him . He could n't see that anything had hurt her , changed her . She appeared to be as well and certainly as enchanting as always , and there was a hint of sunburn on her clear skin . Her black eyes , softened by their extraordinary lashes , looked to him like velvet , as they always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of imaginings , to see her just as usual . But his heart was beating hard . Red and Bob released her , and she came up to Buller and gave him her hand . " So very nice , " she said again . " And I hope it 's doing you and Red lots of good to be up here  --  such blood brothers as you are . What a delightful place it is ! I came up to look it over with Red , you know , but I had n't seen it all lighted like this . " She seemed to be doing it all . Buller could n't yet get his throat clear . Red and Bob also seemed struck with silence . Bob , whom Red had adopted when he was still a bachelor and the boy a small orphan of five , had grown into a tall , handsome youth of seventeen , with black eyes and hair so like Ellen 's , and ap121smile so winning , that he might easily have been her son . Red had always insisted that seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was what had put the idea into his head that they belongedtogether  --  and under his own roof . Though the Burns 's had two other children now , little daughters of whom they were deeply fond , this adopted boy had somehow retained his place as the original link between them , and a son in his own right . Certainly he was behaving like a son now . He shook hands with Dr. Buller , then put his arm about Ellen 's shoulders , and was first to speak , for Red appeared to be strangely dumb as yet . " Shall we go along in and put Mother in one of those , big chairs I see in there ? Not that she seems to need it  --  " he was proceeding with her as he spoke , while Red and Buller stood aside for them  --  " but Dad and I ca n't stop coddling her to-day . " " Tell you all about it to-morrow , Max . " Red had spoken at last , in a queer , gruff voice , such as Buller knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight to bed now . " He went out of the room in the direction of the cook 's quarters . " Of course , there 's no use disputing him when he takes charge , " said Ellen lightly to Buller , who shook his head . " I , can testify to that , " he said . He thought he saw slight signs of strain in her face , in spite of her entirely natural manner . Evidently she had been in some sort of danger , and husband and son were hardly more recovered from the shock of it than she . Bob had sat down upon the arm of her chair , and his young arm still possessed her in her loveliness  --  loveliness  --  that had always been the word for her in Max Buller 's thoughts . Red came back with a glass on a small tray , and a little plate of wafers . Buller , glancing at him , saw a Red who looked , for the hour , ten years older than he had looked yesterday . Just as he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a critical case . Then , always , certain mature lines stood out upon his face which one did n't notice at other times : a grave concentration , a sense of heavy responsibility , a stern self-control , repeated at each new and serious situation , had etched them there . Ellen 's husband smiled as she looked up at him and took the glass . Was he still anxious ? She smiled back , and then Red 's eyes and Bob 's met above her head . How they loved her , thought Buller  --  andp123wondered if they could possibly love her more than he himself , though nobody knew about that . Why should n't he ? Who could help it ? And at this moment , between his physical weakness and his consciousnessthat they must all have come near losing her , he was very nearly done for as to strength to keep on sitting there , aloof , unable to touch her , as they could , or to show more than the interest of a good friend . Friend !  --  He could have died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that strain was soon over for him . They took her away to Red 's own room . " Good-night , Dr. Buller , " she said . " I hope you 'll go to bed soon yourself . ' It 's such a deliciously sleepy air up here in the quiet , is n't it ? " " It surely is : Good-night , Mrs. Burns . Please ) sleep well , wo n't you ? " " Indeed I shall . " " I give her exactly ten minutes to be at it , " Bob called back as the three went out . But Buller could n't sleep . He lay awake all night , until , at dawn , he dropped off for an hour . What had life denied him , that he could know its joys and sorrows , its great experiences , only at a sort of sccond-hand , like this ? 124 IT WAS Bob who told him , in the morning , what had happened . Red had insisted on his wife 's staying quietly in bed all day , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and added , with a , touch of his old whimsical , assured manner , that he had behaved so badly that she had said it was he who ought to be in bed , if anybody must . " The kid 'll tell you what it 's all about , " Red said , as he left the room . " I do n't seem to want to . Funny thing to have the garrulous talker dumb , is n't it ? " " Not exactly funny , Red . Give my  --  good wishes to Mrs. Burns , please . " Queer , tongue-tied Buller . Any other man would have sent his love . Buller , who had so much love to send , could n't even use the word . When he was outside , stretched in his cushioned deck chair in the shade of a group of balsam pines , Bob came out and dropped down upon the fragrant needle-strewn ground beside him . The boy , who was almost a man , sitting with his long , flanneled legs crossed , looked up with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shock had beenp125to him , he was evidently over it , with youth 's elasticity . " This crust all seem a lot of mystery to you , Dr. Buller , " he said . " But Dad would n't have a word of it told last night , and I 'm sure you slept better for not hearing . " " Perhaps , " agreed Buller . He was very weary this morning with the nearly sleepless night , but he was anxious to know what had taken place . He wanted to be able to judge somewhat for himself whether the consequences were likely to have any lasting effect . " Well , it 's soon told , just as it all happened-in one half hour , though it seemed like a year at the time . " The brightness had dropped out of Bob 's face . An expression of fine gravity had taken its place . He was about to live again in the day before . One could n't tell such a story without feeling it . " We have an awfully jolly little cottage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shingles , and a path of flat stones down to where the beach begins . We 're quite far from the other cottages . Nearest ours  --  quite a distance  --  some people came soon after we did . We did n't know them . A big fat man and a big fat wife  --  they did n't look interesting in their bathingia6 RED PEPPER RETURNSp126'clothes . They were in the water a lot the first two days . Then the woman stayed out  --  got too badly burned , we guessed . We noticed them , because Nancy and Betsy  --  my sisters , you know  --  made up names for them at once . The Porpoise and the Lobster they called them , and those names tickled Mother and me , they fitted so well . The man had a grayish purple swimming suit , and the woman a bright red one . We all got to alluding to them by those awful names right off . The man swam like a porpoise , rolling along  --  his fat kept him up , I suppose . The woman could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounder and more tubby than the man . You can see we could n't be much excited about them . They were  --  at any distance  --  you might call them commonplace  --  terribly . Mother insists nobody 's commonplace if you know all about their lives . But these people  --  they were that  --  to me , anyhow . " Bob seemed to use the word with some reluctance , young aristocrat that he looked , though he had been born no aristocrat . But the marks were there . He was simply trying to make Buller see what was to him an important background to his story . Buller saw . Yes , this man and woman were undoubtedly commonplace . And another woman , whose life wasp127priceless , had somehow almost lost it on their account ? He found himself shivering nervously in anticipation . " I wo n't make a long story of it . " Bob noted how little color there was in Dr. Buller 's face and remembered that he was far from well . Dad was staying up here with him on that account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bare facts were enough  --  if Bob could keep to bare facts . There was a touch of the dramatic in Bob . He wanted to write plays some day , when he should know enough about life . At seventeen Bob did n't think he knew all about life . It was Dad who had kept him from thinking that  --  Dad who was still , to Bob , a high authority , because , to his adopted son 's observation , he had never allowed himself to get into a rut . A rut  --  Dad IHe went on , trying to be restrained . " Mother loves to get up and take an early morning dip . So do I  --  when I have n't been out on a late party . There 's a crowd of awfully gay young people at the hotel , up the beach . That morning she was out before I 'd opened my eyes . She 's a marvelous swimmer  --  not for strength or long distance , but for grace and beautiful diving and all that . Looksi28 RED PEPPER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like to have her out alone , though  --  never let her , unless she gives me the slip , as she likes to do  --  especially when it 's high tide . " I woke up that morning  --  yesterday  --  with a queer sort of start , as if I 'd been called . My room faces the sea , and I jumped up and looked out . At first I did n't see anything  --  then I heard the call again , high and desperate sounding . I leaned out of my window and finally saw , pretty well out beyond the surf , and in front of the Porpoise 's cottage , two heads . Saw them off and on , and could n't make out who they were , and of course I did n't stop to see . I ran down and out in my pajamas , and I shed ' em as I ran . No time to bother with togs . Queer , but it came to me , as I sprinted , that Mother 's door had been open when I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I caught a glimpse of something red out there . My first thought was that it was the Lobster , then I knew it was Mother 's red bathing cap . She wears a black suit , but Dad makes her put on a red cap , so she can be seen . Maybe that did n't make me tear along faster ! " Though Bob 's voice was low , excitement was creeping into it . And though Max Buller knew thatp129Ellen was safe , and sleeping quietly in her room up here in the hills , not two hundred feet away from where he and Bob sat , his pulses were hammering . " Hang it , I ca n't seem to make a short story of it , Dr. Buller . " " Of course you ca n't . I want to hear it just as it happened . " Not for nothing had Max Buller , like every man of his profession , been disciplined for many years in keeping his nerves from showing . Bob could n't see that the perspiration was breaking out all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then  --  I got out there just in , time . Mother , game as you make ' em , was keeping that old Porpoise 's head above water  --  somehow . He was groggy with what he 'd swallowed . He 'd got a cramp or something . You see , when she first came out of the house , she 'd seen him in trouble  --  or what she thought might be trouble , though he was n't calling out  --  so she 'd swum out to him . He was pretty far out . She said she thought she might just have to encourage him a little  --  he 'd seemed able enough to swim other days , in his porpoise way . It was awfully early  --  nobody was up , not even the man 's wife . No life guards around at that hour -- m ,  | they are farther up , by the hotel , anyway . When Mother got there she realized she had a real rescue on her hands , and it was then she called  --  and I 'd heard her . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was n't hanging onto her enough to pull her under ; seemed to have sense enough left to know he must n't do that . But he could n't straighten out his legs to swim , and he was half strangled . She was trying to keep his head above water  --  she could n't possibly have brought him in alone . Just how long she could have kept him up there 's no knowing . He was purple in the face , and she was pretty white when I got there , and you knowBob was suddenly silent a minute , and something worked a little in his throat . Then he got the better of it and went on : " I have n't the least idea she 'd ever have let go . She 'd have hung onto him till he lost enough of his own pluck to  --  grip her too tight . You ca n't imagine what  --  my mother is , Dr. Buller . " Could n't he ? Had n't he seen her when years ago Red had fought through weeks of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had thought he could pull through ; keeping her courage , her poise , her gallant smile ? Had n't he seen herp131when her children had been dangerously ill , showingthe poise and endurance and quiet fortitude which had enormously re-inforced the efforts of the doctors 0nd nurses ? Did n't he know how that silken sweetness and charm of hers covered a will like that of a soldier ? Yes , he knew . He too knew that she would have hung on . That both the Porpoiseand the Sea Gull might have been to-day at the bottom of the sea . . . or . . washed up on the beach . And that his friend Red would have wanted to go out and lie beside her , as still as she . He knew , and clenched his thin hands on the arms of his chair . He tooBoB hurried on , evidently trying to be matter-offactafter this one touch of honest emotion . It had been a close shave , no doubt of that , and he could n't forget it . " You see I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None near by , though up by the hotel there were two or three big speed boats and a small outboard motor or two . And when I got out to Mother I saw she was in no shape to swim in alone , even if I could have managed to knock out the Porpoise and tow him in by myself . So I made her let me take him off her hands , gave him enough of a wham under the jaw to stop his struggling , and kept him afloat while I let out some of the wildest Indian yells you ever heard . Mother was floating , and said with what breath she had left she was all right , but I could n't trust her . I watched her every minute and , believe me , I 'd have let the Porpoise go in one split second and taken her in if I 'd seen she needed it . " " Yes . . . " breathed Max Buller . He could see it all . " And at last the Lobster heard me . She came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine with a vengeance . She had on some kind of flapping red kimono over her nightgown , and she began runningup the beach toward the hotel , shrieking as she went . And just about then , when it had begun to seem hopeless , the whole beach woke up . In five minutes more there were two speed boats and a rowboat  --  fisherman'sfrom around the bend the other way  --  all piling toward us . People were shouting , and the boats were tooting , and the war was over . And Mother , lying on her back , close to me , all ready to come back on the job and try to help mep133in case I needed it , said : It looks as though we were going to get back in time for breakfast after all , Bobby . ' Can you beat that ? " Buller did n't need to reply . He did n't try . " Well , that 's all of it . They got Mother and me into one boat and hauled the Porpoise into another  --  they estimated he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd swallowed . There was a welcoming committee on the beach , and it was just about when I saw it that I realized I was n't exactly dressed to be welcomed . You remember I 'd dropped those pajamas on the beach . The men in the boat fixed me out , though they were n't very thoroughly clad themselves . At least I had somebody 's shirt draped round my loins and tied by the sleeves . " " Your mother  --  when you got her in . . ? " questioned Buller . It was even yet as though he did n't know she was safely sleeping only those two hundred yards away . " Oh , two huskies made a chair of their hands and carried her to our cottage . I 'd have preferred to do it myself , playing the hero part in my borrowed shirt . But instead I found myself being hoisted up  --  only I got away . One benevolent old fellow  --  hep134must have slept with his hip flask on him to have had it on hand so early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both a bracer . It brought back the color to Mother 's face in a jiffy . . . . As for the Porpoise , you know I would n't have left tellingabout him to the last if he had n't been in fair enough shape to be turned over to the Lobster . He 'd just about come to when we got to land , and I 'll say he 'd had rather the best time of the three of us , having nobody on his mind to be worried over except himself . He and the Lobster came over later in the day , and somehow , when they were stumbing over their thanks , they did n't seem quite so commonplaceafter all . I was glad they had n't been separated for good , they seemed to think such a lot of each other . " " Then you called your father , " prompted Buller . " I did , after I 'd got a doctor over from the hotel to make sure Mother was all right . He said she was , only needed rest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd come , just the same . When he reached there he  --  well  --  I guess I 'd better not go into that . You can see for yourself how the whole thing got him . " Buller nodded . Being on the outside looking inRED PEPPER RETURNS 135p135is an amazing stimulus to the imagination . He closed his eyes . " So here we are , and it 's a great morning to be alive in , " ended Bob cheerfully , getting up and dusting pine needles from the gray-flanneled legs . " I 'm going to wander down that trail and let you rest . It 's going to do you a lot of good to be up here , Dr. Buller. " - Buller opened his eyes . " Yes , " he agreed . " Only do n't let anything like this happen again , Bob . " " You bet I wo n't , if I have the whole coast guard out when my pretty mother gets up early to go in swimming . " " You 're  --  both  --  going back ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Dad 's satisfied Mother 's done nothing to hurt , herself  --  as of course she has n't . She could have managed anything that was n't a ton of blubber  --  she 's saved at least three kids from drowning , and one or two women , in her time . I 'll admit they were nearer shore than the Porpoise , but she 's mighty fit , you know  --  Dad 's kept her so . " Bob strolled away . Buller presently went to sleep from sheer exhaustion . Even listening may be arduous when one is very nearly down and out. 136 RED PEPPER RETURNSp136NEXT morning Red was himself again . He came in and sat on the edge of Buller 's bed  --  breakfast had been sent in for the guest , and he had just finished it . Red had insisted that Buller should permitthis much of what the invalid called coddling . Buller had n't been running any temperature except when overtired , or Red would n't have let him out of bed at all . " Len 's fit as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in to see you . They 're going back this morning . Brown will drive them down . " " So soon ? " " Len 's got the babes on her mind . Left ' em with Celia and a friend of hers , who could be trusted with heirs to the British throne , if necessary . But it seems there 's a children 's party on at the hotel tomorrow , and Len wants to see ' em enjoy it . Besides , she insists on leaving you and me together . Got to let her have her way . " " You do n't dread having her back there again , where " " Why , what 's scaring you , Grandmother ? Ofp137course I dread it . That 's why I 'm letting her go . Len would n't stand for being kept from it , and I know better than to try . Do n't these flying fellows who come down after making a near thing of it go straight up again to get back their nerve ? " " Yes  --  I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me when she " Now , just get over that . That 's what she wants to see you about . " " I 'll get up and dress . " " No , you wo n't . " Red 's fingers explored his friend 's wrist . " I 'm not sure but this little episode has been harder on you than on any of us . Inaction always is , in crises . Anyhow , in bed you stay till noon , anyhow , and Len will be in in fifteen minutes . That 'll give you time to have Brown shave you and put some perfume behind your ears . " It sounded like the old Red again , and Buller had to submit. 9ELLEN BURNS came in alone presently . She didlook " fit as a fiddle , " and there was no cause for theinvalid guest to feel any more concern about her . Hewas almost glad she was going back . He couldn'tp138have stood much more of having her under the same roof with him . It was undermining to that obstinate will of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to think about her and Red together . Worn out though he was , he still was a man ; this woman was the one the very thought of whom had for years made it hardest for him . She was so lovely . . . so lovely . . . . She sat down by his bed . He knew his hand had been icy cold and maybe a little damp when he had taken her warm one in it . But he could n't help that , though he hated the realization . She looked fresh and young , her black eyes rested on his thin face with a beautiful friendliness in them , as always . She wore some sort of apple green sports clothes , with a little green hat ; he thought they suited her , as whatever she wore did suit her . " Max , " she began  --  and paused . His unsteady pulses had started at the sound of his Christian name on her lips . She saw his surprise , and smiled . " It 's absurd that we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burns , in the oldfashionedway , all these years , when you and Red are such tremendous friends . Now that I see you in bed , and looking like a good little boy with nop139defenses , I 'm going to begin taking down those bars to a better acquaintance . May I ? " " Of course . . . . I should like nothing better . I ca n't put up bars now  --  certainly not against you , . Mrs. Burns . " " You stubborn person ! Wo n't you please let me be Ellen ' to you ? " " If you will . " The thought of it made him very happy . " You and I have n't seen much of each other , have we ? You 've been far too busy , and your friendship with Red has been due to your professional contacts . I think you 've got out of every invitation to our home I 've ever given you . " Her gay glance challenged him to deny it . He could only make a little gesture of apology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , and seen us through so many difficult , anxious days . I can never forget . Neither can Red . And now that you 're having to lie by for a little , up here , I 'm so anxious you should n't keep on worrying that Red is staying here with you , instead of being with us . The honest truth , Max . . . " Would it do it every time  --  that queer pulse of his ? What an odd old duffer he was that a womanp140could n't speak his name without his behaving inside like a bashful schoolboy . Ah , but it was this woman  --  that made all the difference. " . . . is that you 're doing me an enormous favor by letting Red stay . Though he does n't know it , he needs the rest almost as much as you do , but he 'd only take it for your sake , if he thought you needed him . So , do n't you see ? It 's your plain ungarnished duty  --  did n't some poet use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chums with him . I think , to look at you  --  though you look much better than when I saw you last  --  you 're still not relaxing and letting this place have its chance with you . Wo n't you do that  --  for our sakes  --  Red 's and mine ? " He lay looking at her , drinking her in . It was to him a marvelous moment , for with the question she had put out that warm , firm hand of hers and was letting it rest on his with a gentle pressure . He ' wanted to turn his own over and grasp hers , but . . . again he was too conscious of its chill and dampness . The sense of her affectionate touch was to this celibate almost . . . what an embrace from ' her might have been to Red  --  or to any man who loved her . She was waiting for him to answer , and he wasp141slow in answering , because he knew she would then take her hand away . And then , suddenly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn his hand over and seized hers and held it , and looked for just this once into her pitiful , comprehending black eyes with all his long-suppressed worship of her showing in his own . She gave him back the look , steadily , deeply , as though she felt it the one thing she could do for him . She put out her other hand and held his in both her own and said very gently : " Dear Max . . . I 'm so glad . Now I can go away quite happily , knowing you acknowledge the friendship with me as well as with Red . I wanted that so much . I came in here deliberately intending to break down those reserves of yours , because I was sure you needed to have them broken down . We love you so dearly . I do n't mind saying that in the least , it 's so true . My dear friend , promise me you 'll put your own will  --  your magnificent will you 've exercised all your life  --  into getting well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could bear , it touched him so deeply and thrilled him so poignantly . To have Ellen Burns . . . all to himself . . . for this moment.  |p142He  lost his head  --  at least he would have called it losing it , though any other man would have smiled at the idea  --  and answered hoarsely , with his eyes still searching hers : " If you 'll say  --  for your sake  --  Ellen . . . " " Of course I 'll say it . Anything to make you do it . For my sake , then , Max . . . . And I mean it , too  --  for my sake . " " Yes . . . I 'll try . " He was suddenly a little exhausted . She saw it and jumped up . " We 've been too emotional , I 'm afraid , but I do n't mind , if you do n't . I 'll get you a glass of orange juice , or something . " " I do n't want it . I 'm all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She went out , and after a moment Red came in with her . Very soon he took her away . But as they went he looked back at his friend , smiling . " She 's pretty dear , eh , Max ? " Buller nodded . " She shall be as dear to you as she likes . She 's coming up for each week-end with us , and we shall have that to look forward to . " " That will be great , " answered Buller , in as strong a tone as he could manage.  | " Till next Saturday , then , " said Ellen , with a wave of her hand . Buller lay weakly back against his pillow . Presently , he lifted the hand she had held , looked at it , and put it to his lips . He thought he might n't get well  --  he did n't know  --  but a  --  least  --  she and Red would see him through . It was enough to go on with , since he had to go on awhile yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the thought of going on . . . with them . Anyhow , it was vacation time at last.  |p144LETTER  from Dr. Burns to his sister , Anne Sutherland , in a sanitarium in Southern Italy . DEAR ANNE : I 've had a queer experience to-day , and since as I sit down to write to you I ca n't think of much else , I may as well let you have it . I do n't know when anything has happened that got me so by the throat . I do n't know whether you remember Amy Mathewson . In the earlier days of my practice she was not only my office nurse , but she used to work opposite me at the operating table whenever I could n't be sure of the right man . I used her for a special type of cases  --  I wo n't bother to go into that . But she was great stuff , and I prized her very highly  --  and was mostly in too much of a hurry to tell her so . She left me about four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own home , a long way off , on a short vacation . I filled her place with considerable ' success  --  got a bright , intelligent young nurse , whop145was n't filmy , by a long shot , but who made both me and my patients much more aware of her quite charming personality than filmy ever had . So when Amy wrote she could n't come back I sent her a hasty scrawl of regret and best wishes , plus a check for her services , and went on , ungrateful and uncomprehending , man fashion , without further thought of her . Ellen , who understands quite a lot of things that I overlook , sent her a letter which was by no means a scrawl , added a good deal about how much we both thought of her , bearing heavily on my own appreciation of her and the tremendous loss I felt she would be to me , and sent her also some sort of gorgeous gift such as a woman thinks of at such times and a busy man does n't  --  unless he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  after four years . She did n't send in her name  --  asked Miss Carter to hold it back because she was an old friend and wanted , to surprise me . Well  --  she surprised me all right . She 'd been a pretty girl of the kind that once we 'd have called " modest . " Nobody ever uses that word any more , probably . I mean that she was very quiet , sweet faced , soft voiced , absolutely without guile ,  | unbelievably conscientious , faithful , loyal , self  --  effacing . Can you see her , even though you do n't remember her ? Well trained and efficient in her work , but even there never assertive  --  unless that became her duty , in which case she could be unexpectedlyfirm . In other words , she was what you would call drab  --  I suppose she was drab , as compared with the young woman of these days . Certainly , I never saw in her or guessed at then what I saw to-day . To-day she was n't drab . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had grown very thin , her hair was beginning to show a touch of gray at the ears , she was dressed with the same careful neutralitythat had always been her preference , and over her eyes she wore dark spectacles . No , mostly becauseof those spectacles , I did n't know her until she spoke . " Dr. Burns , I 'm Amy Mathewson . " You could have knocked me down and I would n't have noticed it , I was so amazed . I had to pull myselftogether to say that I was mighty glad to see her and would n't she sit down and tell me all about herself . I sat staring at her then while she explained . that she had been coming through on her waypI47South and had stopped off to see us . Miss Carter had told her that Mrs. Burns and the children were away , but she had wanted to see me most. , because she had worked for me so long , and she did n't know whether she would ever see me again becauseAnne , the dear , tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's irreparable . The wrong drug shot into them by mistake . She 'll be totally blind in anothersix months  --  at thirty-six . There 's nothing that will stop it . She 's been learning massage , because that 's the one thing she could think of to do without sight . She was on her way down to a friend in Tennessee  --  another nurse  --  who will try to get such work for her . She 's brave as they make ' em . No , she would n't stay and make us a visit , she would n't even stay the night  --  there was nothing she would let me do for her  --  nothing , thank you , Dr. Burns . She 'd just come to She stood up  --  I stood up . Anne , I would n't be telling you this if I did n't think it might be good for you to hear , just now , when you feel as though you 'd had rather a bad time and are more or less dissatisfied with your life anyway . Amy Mathewson is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elen'sp148the only other person who will hear of it , when she comes back . Just how it will touch her I know well enough . I more than suspect she always knew . " Dr. Burns , " said this little person  --  she had already shown me her eyes , but she took off the spectacles again . Her eyes are still beautiful  --  when one does n't look too close  --  " I came to tell you somethingbecause I think it will be a relief to me to do it  --  now . I never would have dreamed of telling you  --  until  --  I knew what was coming . I came to  --  . look at you once more  --  if you would n't mind standing in a quite bright light . Because  --  I could n't help loving you all those years I worked for you . " Anne , I swear I could have burst out crying like a schoolboy . But I did n't , though all the pity that was in me surged up in my throat till it nearly choked me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examining floodlight I have in the private office , turned it full on my own face , and stood there . To watch her try to get me in focus was a thing to break the heart . I thought she was never going to be able to do it , but finally I could see that she had managed it , and could see me fairly well in that terrific light that must have brought out every feature . She stood and gazed at me as long as shep149could bear it , and then she suddenly turned and put on the spectacles again , and I could see the tears running down her cheeks . I could n't say a word . But she did . " You look so little changed , " she said . " I ca n't understand it , with your crowded life . There are lines in your face , but they do n't spoil it  --  they only make it stronger I  --  oh , you do n't know how glad I am to see you again  --  just this once again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're going to see me again many times , Amy dear . I 've got to change those plans of yours . You 're going to stay in this town  --  my wife and I will find you a place . We 'll see you through this till you get used to it , and we 'll She shook her head . I knew I could n't move her . I realized what a will had been behind all her quiet ways all her life . Somehow , for all the signs of strain and suffering in her , I suddenly saw her as a dear creature , still young  --  why , as young as you are , Anne  --  only thirty-six , and what 's that , for a woman ? There was something exquisite about her face , as there always had been , and as I remembered . " No , " she said . " find I should n't have come ; f 1p150had n't known it would be the last time . Because 1 had to tell you  --  what I have told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imagine a young woman of these times hesitating much to let a man know she had always thought a lot of him  --  more than of any other . Why , how many women have let me hear that , first and last , and in no uncertain terms  --  just as they have any other man who happened to take their fancy . But , I tell you I understood that it was the moment of her life , to Amy Mathewson , when she said she had always loved me . And for all her simple way of putting it , I knew I had actually been the passion of that poor , circumscribedlife . There was just one thing I could do for her , and I did it . Took her in my arms and gave her a long , kiss  --  such a kiss as a man might have given her : f he had loved her as she loved him . I did it with a will , too . I ought to have been shot if I had n't . And she took it like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . I knew she 'd take it with her , into the dark , because she was like that  --  and because she was starving and for once she had been fed . Just once . My God , Anne , think of that ! She went away without another word , and 1p151did n't follow her out , because I had wits enough to realize she would n't want me to . I sat still and thought about it , and what I thought was plenty . I guess that 's all . Yours , RED.  --   |p152I  CA N'T get her to come in , " explained Mr. George Graham to Dr. Redfield Pepper Burns , in his private office . " She insists on sitting in the car . I can manage "  --  hesaid it with distress in his face  --  " corporations , but I ca n't manage my daughter . I am so anxious to have you see her . " " We can bring that about . I 'll go out to the car , " replied Dr. Burns promptly . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughters , at almost any age  --  well . . . Just give me a few facts to go on , will you , Mr. Graham ? " " The one fact it is most necessary for you to know , " said Mr. Graham , taking a handkerchief of extreme fineness from his breast pocket and passing it across his troubled brow , " is that she has been married and divorced twice . And she is only twenty-four . " Burns 's eyebrows drew together in an odd way . . Then they smoothed out again . He did n't look in the least daunted by the news .   " That does seem to be a sort of symptom , " he acknowledged . " Not necessarily so serious a symptom as it would have been twenty years ago , but still  --  rather disturbing to a parent . What , Mr. Graham , did you feel that I could do for her ? I imagine she 's not physically much affected by this state of her affairs . " Mr. Graham gave him a surprised glance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be  --  in the least . Yet nothing can be done with her in the way of getting her to take any interest in life . That 's what I 'm anxious about . " " She 's used up a good many of the interests , I judge , " mused Burns , " that ordinarily extend over quite a term of years . Do I gather the idea that she is , in the terms of to-day , bored ? ' " " That is her own word for it , " admitted the young divorcee 's father . " I see . And you 've suggested foreign travel , a long sea voyage , taking an apartment in Paris with a woman friend , going into social service work , goingto bed , possibly going into your office ? " " Dr. Burns , you are possessed of powers of divination which seem most unusual . I have suggestedall except the last . My daughter is hardly fitted  | " I presume not . Suppose we go out and let her take a look at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , that is what I am anxious for . " Burns opened a door out of his private office which led into his home 's own hallway , thus evadingpatients in the waiting room . He led Mr. Graham out by this route to the street , and so to the great black motor standing well down the line of waiting cars . A chauffeur got out instantly and opened the rear door , inside which sat one who looked to Burns , approaching , like some haughty young princess refusing to see anything within her line of vision . Indeed , he said to himself , she looked even haughtier than any princess whose photograph taken at lawn parties on royal estates he had ever scanned in the illustrated edition . The case was becominginteresting . He always did enjoy meeting obstacles , and this one was very good-looking . " Eleanora , " said her father , in his gentlest tones , " Dr. Burns has been so kind as to come out himself  --  thoughhe is very busy . My daughter , Dr. Burns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , his daughter did n't put out her hand.  |p15SShe  gave him a glance and a slight nod . He returned them with a look at her which went for an instant deeper than hers at him . He gave her no word at all . He did n't even smile  --  since she did n't . By no possibilitycould she have called his manner ingratiating . He really paid her scant attention , but turned back immediately to her father . Upon which she quite naturally looked at him again . He was worth looking at , as many people before her had discovered . " Mr. Graham , " said Burns , " this is Saturday afternoon , and I 'm leaving in an hour for your camp . You 've never visited it since you lent it to my friend Dr. Buller . My wife and my son Bob are there to-night . I 'd like them to meet you  --  and you them . Two other people may run up this evening . You know that cabin will easily accommodate a dozen guests , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you and your daughterwill do us the honor " He and Mr. Graham together turned back toward Eleanora , and this time her eyes and Burns 's met for a longer period than before . Now Burns had a way of looking at women , when he wished to bring them to his will , which usually accomplished that end .
