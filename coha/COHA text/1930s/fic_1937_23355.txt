THE BOND SALESMAN A STORY BY GRIFFITH BEEMS tiE voice , the jocularity , the pro- tracted banter finally ended ; and disconnecting with his forefinger , Vander-berg swore to himself . He hunched the receiver between his collarbone and his ear and , mumbling angrily , crossed off another telephone number from the list on his calendar pad . Vanderberg was not apt at banter : he hated it from his customers . Delisle , at the desk ahead of Vander-berg 's , was scanning the day 's closing bond prices in the New York Sun . Behind the railings of the Sales Department , in seven rows were twenty-one telephones on twenty-one desks , three in each row . It was Monday . Delisle was accustomed to Vanderberg 's inarticulate occasional angry mumble . " What 's the matter , Van ? " he asked , chuckling behind the market pages . " Somebody throw you for a loss ? " Delisle had been selling bonds for a long time and had worked up to a clientele almost entirely of banks , insurance companies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assurance and in the course of years , casually , without remarking it , without thinking twice about it , had taken Vanderberg under his wing . Vanderberg was much younger , ambitious , an earnest expounder of market tendencies , a plugger . At thirty he had been selling bonds for four years . " He wanted to know since when Commonweal turned boiler factory for Mike Vaihinger . Boiler factory ! A crack like that from a customer burns me . How does he get that way ? Boiler factory ! " Vanderberg 's indignation was belligerently righteous . The Commonweal Company , investment affiliate of the Commonweal Bank &; Trust Company , was as respectable a house as there was in the Street . " What is there against Mike Vaihinger ? " " Not a thing , only ? " " Only what ? " His fist round the telephone , the receiver gripped on his shoulder , Vanderberg challenged Delisle , not lifting his head . Vanderberg 's face , determined and rather immobile , had thickening cheeks , a cleft chin , stolid nose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true . Lumberjack to millionaire in twelve years . They 're afraid of your boy wonders . Some of them season and some of them do n't . " " Give me young management any day , " Vanderberg said laughing . His telephone rang . It was Adams , to whom he had sold five Itasca 31/2s that morning . Adams never bought without stewing afterward ; he had been consulting his bank , his broker , friends , another bond salesman , and his own fears and he was properly upset . Perhaps he should cancel the order . Vanderberg answered him earnestly , prolixly . Mr. Eleazar Adams was reassured . More Vaihinger talk , " Vanderberg grumbled . Delisle came round and sat on Vanderberg 's desk , folding his newspaper . " Honest , Van , " he queried , leaning forward , his head quizzically cocked , " do n't you know what 's wrong with these Itasca 31/25 ? " " They 're slow . " " Slow ? " Delisle 's lips twisted cynically to the left . His heels derisively drummed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you smell , Van ? " He dilated his , nostrils , eyebrows jumping , and sniffed significantly half a dozen times , ending with a sickly grimace . " Give a smell . " " At 96 they 're overpriced . " " Take the plug out of your nose and give a good smell . " Vanderberg slipped the receiver on the hook and pushed the telephone away . He was concerned . Delisle was exaggerating of course , but exaggeration and flippancy were always ambiguous to Vanderberg . " What do you mean ? " he demanded . " Who banked for Vaihinger until this issue ? " " City Bankers . " " Well ? " " You mean Vaihinger changed bank-ers ? " " This issue came too fast , Van . Think it over . " Vanderberg frowned , thinking . " I 'm trying to put it together , " he said . Delisle slapped him on the shoulder with the newspaper . " Do n't put it together , " he counselled . " You 'll feel better . " He waved jauntily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flash that had broken the issue that morning and read over again the information on Itasca Corp . Fifteen Year 31/2% , S/F Gold Debentures , due 1944 . When he had first read the flash , he conjectured , with immediate market sense , that at 96 the issue was overpriced . Vaihinger was getting less than four per cent money , and in Vanderberg 's judgment , on debentures , he rated perhaps under five . The bonds had been priced out of their class and would be difficult to move . But De-lisle meant that behind the overpricing was a maneuver by the Commonweal Bank &; Trust Company to get Vaihinger 's banking business away from City Bankers by having the affiliate outbid the City Bankers group . That had run the price up . Or perhaps City Bankers had declined the issue . By temperament conservative and methodical , Vanderberg accepted the integrity of Commonweal issues , and economics was for him a solid , predictable science . The bond market , its trends , corrections , recoveries , and declines had the reality of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market strength and weakness almost as discernible as flesh-and-blood actors , but the drama had a minimum of suspense ; for Van statistical methods determined the market . His sales presentations were weightily generalized , circumstantially statistical , and convincing . The covenanted interest , safety of principal , and a slight profit on Commonweal issues seemed to follow inexorably through Vanclerberg 's ponderous deductions . It was characteristic of him that he should have noticed that the Itascas were overpriced at 96 without surmising any psychological motive or financial advantage to the Bank behind it . He was unsuspicious , incurious . But Delisle 's supposition , once injected , was plausible , and Vanderberg was abruptly and sullenly angry that the Sales Department should be expected to shoulder a difficult issue in order to attach Vaihinger to the Bank . The Sales Department was entitled to sound pricing . Overpricing was stupid , wrong . Vanderberg went to the manuals and then he reviewed the market movements for the Vaihinger securities in recent months . The market preparation for the Itascas was sloppy and hurried . Vanderberg 's disgust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chinned with him . Stahl had doped the issue the same way as Delisle . He had sold ten . " I do n't know as I want to sell them , " Vanderberg grumbled . " Maybe you do n't work on commission , " Stahl said . That evening Vanderberg talked the Itasca 31/2s over with Miriam . They had been married for two years and Van was still convinced of Miriam 's underlying judgment and shrewdness . He leaned in the doorway of the kitchenette , backed against the porcelain sink , and generally got in the way , eagerly explaining while Miriam finished preparing dinner . Enveloped in a kitchen apron , he set the table , forked the baked squash from the oven , and carried dishes , explaining the while . " I declare , Van , " Miriam said , holding up her napkin for inspection as she sat down to dinner , " if what you been telling me is mighty important you better begin and tell it over again . " Miriam was a slender , brown-eyed , lackadaisical lanky-jointed girl with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the Carolina piedmont in her voice . The napkin , she decided , was passably fresh . " Without Ruby , I declare , sometimes I think I 'm flighty . " For the first six months of their marriage Ruby had come in to help , but Van , who before Commonweal bond-school and Columbia University hailed originally from Nebraska , had decided that the money for a negro maid should preferably go into life insurance . They were going to have children , Van had decided , as soon as his commissions ran into five figures , and he was organizing their life accordingly . Miriam had ineffectually protested about Ruby . " While I 'm working in the kitchen , honey , " she reminded him , " stirring round , doing everything myself , what you say goes right in one ear and out the other . And you know how I am about your Wall Street . I have n't got a man 's head like yours for high finance . Now we 're sitting here , all comfortable , you begin again and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you get ? " Van demanded , very blunt . Miriam 's cautiousness , the ingratiating locutions , under cover of which , woman-fashion , shesounded new matters , entertained him . Miriam tossed her head . " It 's about some bonds , " she said pertly . " Covering up , eh ? " " Now do n't you tease me , honey-lamb . You tell . " " All right . " Explaining high finance was his conversational staple , especially to Miriam . Explaining , simplifying , illustrating to Miriam always clarified Vanderberg 's own mind . Perhaps the enjoyment of his own audible clarifications was the larger part of the judgment and shrewdness he attributed to his wife . " The issue 's overpriced , " he finished . " It 's no way to run an underwriting business . There are sound principles , Miriam . The Bank and the Buying De ? partment ignore the principles , make gross mistakes , and the Sales Department , as usual , has to get them off the hook . " He made Miriam anxious ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds . " But honey , " she asked , worrying , " if they make the price too high how you going to sell these bonds ? The people wo n't buy . " " I can sell them . " Van was emphatic as to his own ability . " My quota 's fifty . I 've sold five to Adams and in ten minutes on the telephone in the morning I could sell at least twenty more . Dr. Bevans has twenty Portland Electrics maturing next month and if I told him to take these , he would . He 's a good customer of mine . Ile trusts my judgment , Miriam . I 've never lost any money for him . I could pay him par and the full interest now on his Portland Electrics and switch him into these Itascas . " " Then why do n't you , honey ? " Vanderberg put forcible shape and consciousness to the indecision that had restrained him from telephoning Dr. Bevans all day . " I do n't want to , " he announced angrily . Bevans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was different perhaps . Adams looked after himself . " You mean it 's your conscience , Van ? " Miriam asked anxiously . The old-fashioned , womanish phrase made him uncomfortable . The clarification was too extreme . " Sort of ? ' " What can they do to you , if  --  if ? " " Nothing . " In his aggrieved voice there was the stubborn tightness that she recognized . He had been stubborn about Ruby . " My volume 's up , higher than last year 's even . They could make things a little difficult , not throw me my share of the institutional business , shortchange me here and there . But damn it , Miriam , I 'm a good salesman and that 's what they need . " " I do n't want you to go against your conscience , Van . You always do like your conscience says , and maybe if you string along with the other boys and do like they do , it 'll all come fine . " But for Vanderberg , from an outrage to economics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanding into larger moral explicitness . " I do n't want to sell them , " he complained . There was a kind of dishonesty involved and he raised his voice , invigorated by further clarity and indignation : " I 've sold issues that I 've been shaky about maybe but never one that I downright distrusted as I do these Itascas . I do n't want to begin . I 'm not going to either . " Van 's substantial mouth set and his upper lip receded to a tightened dominating line . " Anybody that buys these bonds and puts them away in his box is going to lose money eventually . I know that and I 'm supposed to go out and sell them . I wo n't do it . " " What does that nice Mr. Schaeffer say ? " Schaeffer was the manager of the Sales Department . " He says what he always says , ' Get the hell out and sell . ' " " Why , Van ! " " I do n't want to sell them . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can go and take a mighty stubborn streak . You do n't want to get worked up about these old bonds . You do like the other boys do . And do n't go against your conscience either . " " I 'm not going to sell them . " " Now , now , you honey-lamb . You listen to me . That 's not the way to be sensible . " The next morning , Tuesday , at ten o'clock , Schaeffer called a sales meeting in his office , which was an indication that the Itascas had not moved the preceding day . The salesmen sat on chairs , on the table , on the window-ledge , while Schaeffer talked . Schaeffer was a round-jawed , pursy , dapper man , with thinning hair and a jerky short-breathed excitable way of talking . He sat sideways on his desk , fiddling a pencil back and forth in his fingers , and went after them . Schaeffer had a reputation for fiareups and for running to MacArthur , the senior officer in charge of Sales , with tattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and made himself felt , a worried , dogged , attentive presence . He lambasted them for yesterday 's letdown and then for fifteen minutes talked enthusiastically about Mike Vaihinger . " It 's Mike Vaihinger you 're selling , his record , his future , his possibilities , " he concluded . " Do n't forget it . " Vanderberg , standing against the wall in the hack , sarcastically recalled the bond-school distinctions between investment and speculation and asked himself what Vaihinger 's mortal future had to do with sound bonds . Schaeffer tossed down his pencil and stood up . " Any questions , men ? " The inquiry was not wholly perfunctory . Questions relieved the questioner and informed Schaeffer of the morale of his force . This time there was a storm of questions and cracks . " Why are n't we getting any co-operation upstairs ? The market 's been butchered . " " They 've slopped all over the place . " " Tried to pull them up by the ears . " " City Banker 's gunning for us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price them right in the first place ? " called Vanderberg . Schaeffer slammed the fiat of his hand on the desk . " Just a minute , " he shouted . " Just a minute . I did n't call a board of directors meeting . You fellows are bond salesmen , not presidents . Your job is to sell bonds . Now my department is n't passing the buck to any other department . I want that understood . We sell the bonds that the house takes . This issue should have gone out the window yesterday . Vanderberg there asked a question . He wanted to know why the bonds were n't priced right . I 'm going to spike that right now . It 's the swelled-head , smart-aleck , damn-fool kind of a question I do n't want to hear . Any man in the Sales Department who 's putting a price on bonds does n't belong in the Sales Department . He belongs in the Buying Department upstairs , assuming he belongs in the organization at all . I do n't give a damn myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong in my department These bonds were priced by the smartest pricing outfit in the Street and the price is right . Get that , the price is right . And the market for this piece of paper has been made by the smartest marketing outfit in the Street . Do n't forget it . That 's all , men . Get going . " " Gosh , Van , " Stahl remarked , clapping him on the shoulder as they walked back to their desks together , " you need n't have said that . Price is the sore point . You stuck out your neck . " " But it 's true . " Vandenberg was surly . " What 's that got to do with it ? " Stahl said . Being singled out decided Vandenberg . Schaeffer need n't have jumped down his throat . The price was right and no back-talk . All right , if that was Schaeffer 's attitude , there was n't going to be any backtalk , but so far as he was concerned there were n't going to be any sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schaeffer could n't bulldoze him into selling bonds he disliked . He was n't going to take any risks , he 'd be discreet , not antagonize Schaeffer ; but salesmen had ways . If he kept his mouth shut and went through the motions of selling he was out his commissions , but Schaeffer would have nothing definite to hang on him . If he could n't sell , he could n't  --  there was nothing they could do to him for that  --  and as he had told Miriam , there were ways of putting a sales proposition that always failed . An apathetic voice , a relaxed face , perhaps a few remarks about the " duty " of presenting the issue , and the customer had caught on and was beaming . Being tipped off occasionally not to buy the house 's offerings had an excellent effect on the customer . He felt protected ; it made him believe in the salesman 's alertness and personal integrity . Van called on several of his best customers that morning . An uneasy obscure expediency kept him away from Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Itascas . When he returned to the office at four o'clock he found slips on his desk for two telephone calls from Mr. Adams . Van did n't feel like reassuring Adams again on those five bonds . He threw the slips in the wastebasket and went over and complained to Whitney about his terrible day . A little later Schaeffer stopped at his desk and half apologized . " I 'm afraid I was a little rough on you this morning , " he said . " Nothing per-sonal . " " That 's all right , " Van agreed , not smiling . " Not sore , are you , Van ? " " Of course not . " Schaeffer sat down in the chair adjoining Van 's desk . " How have they been going to-day ? " he inquired with his pursed , overt smile . Uneasily Van noticed Schaeffer 's resemblance to an over-solicitous , nosey woman . Already , instead of bluff casualness , Van was tighten . ing up inside , resisting . He fought down the impulse , the inflection , of wariness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , " he grouched . " It 's terrible . I do n't know what the trouble is . High pressure 's not my method . You know that . I spill my line but it has n't been going over . I do n't understand it . " " How many did you call to-day ? " " Ten or eleven good ones . " " Listen , Van . You were n't serious this morning  --  that crack about overpricing ? " " Hell , no . Everybody was putting in his two bits ' worth this morning and I thought l 'd sound off too , the first thing that came into my head . It is n't that . I do n't know what it is . The bonds are all right . " " I 'm glad to hear you say that . As I dope you , Van , you 're the type of salesman that 's got to be sold himself before he can sell . I 've been wondering if I 'd have to do a little selling on you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . The reference to doing a little selling on him was a threat . He had n't handled himself any too well with Schaeffer . Too stiff . His intonation had been off several times . The laugh had been tight , squeezed out . Van stared back at the staring hypnotic mouthpiece of his telephone and asked himself how Schaeffer sized him up . In a tangle of this sort he was at a disadvantage ; Schaeffer was ruthless , sharper , more devious . He was afraid of Schaeffer . But he was not backing down . The apology was soft soap and he could n't be soft-soaped into selling the Itascas any more than he could be browbeaten . But from now on , he was going to be careful , very careful . Schaeffer was dangerous . And suddenly Van was angry ; he swore morosely and softly at the attentive black mouthpiece ; he damned the sticky overpriced Itascas , Commonweal , and Schaeffer . He was his embattled , outspoken , intrepid self . It was a decided relief . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers continued declining the issue . He never disparaged the Itascas explicitly and if the issue was attacked he defended it ; but no one mistook argumentativeness for aggressiveness or recitation for conviction . Van and the customers both enjoyed the game ; it was a change , like playing " give-away " in checkers . Van had five refusals that morning . When he came in De/isle went over and sat on his desk . " Schaeffer said I should talk to you , " he began , shaking his rolled-up newspaper in solemn , exaggerated warning , " so I am . Understand . He told me to tell you you were preparing a lot of trouble for yourself and I 'm telling you now . He said you were carrying a chip on your shoulder . He said he thought he 'd have to discuss you with MacArthur , our esteemed senior officer . " " What else ? " " That 's about all , I guess . Said you were pulling your punch with your customers . Now you 're told . " " Thanks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistled into it for several minutes . " Van , " he said , " did you ever think about these big organizations  --  the way they behave ? Take these sticky Itascas , for example . The issue 's not breaking . It 's not your fault . It 's not my fault . It 's not even Schaeffer 's fault . But it 's not breaking and Schaeffer 's getting hell right along from upstairs for not moving it . And upstairs they 're getting hell from the Bank . If the bonds are n't sold somebody who was n't planning on it is in business with Mike Vaihinger . There 's a line of fellows , starting with the president of Commonweal right down to you and me , and everyone with a bonfire under his pants . And you never know which way a fellow will squirm when his pants are smoking . " He paused , whistling . " Senior officers hop like popcorn . I tell you , Van , these big organizations are like large rickety old boilers . They get up steam every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just put two pounds more pressure under them and they begin to leak live steam at every joint . Anybody handy 's apt to get scalded . I 've seen it happen . " " Do you think I 'm making myself conspicuous ? " " You 're not ordinarily a complete flop as a salesman , Van . And there 's that peep about overpricing yesterday morning . It 's on the record and it 's against you . " " What do you think I should do ? " Delisle sing-songed into his rolled-up newspaper . " I 'd sell a few bonds . I 'd sell a few bonds , " he intoned , sotto voce . Then he lifted his head . " Do n't get me wrong , Van . I do n't want to know any-thing . " " If I 'm making myself conspicuous , " Van said , " I want to know it . " Delisle leaned over and tapped him confidentially . " Stop and think about this , Van . You 've got customers you do n't like . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe they do n't trust him . Maybe they insult his outfit , call it a boiler factory . Maybe they make a practice of blowing their noses on his necktie . Maybe they throw stones at his grandmother . Why do n't you go out and sell a few of these bonds to the customers you do n't like ? What would be wrong with that ? " Vanderberg laughed . " It 's an idea . " He stared at the telephone and reflected . He tapped his teeth with his fingernail . " Maybe it is an idea , " he said slowly . Van had never liked E. D. McKeon . McKeon was a crusty , puttering , suspicious , half-deaf old lawyer , who had no practice but occupied himself with conserving a fortune , inherited two generations before , of possibly half a million dollars . He had once bought fifty bonds but he did not trust Van . He did not trust any salesman . McKeon had been swindled , so he claimed , by a client who had persuaded him to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before National Cordage crashed in 1893 , and this client endured as the prototype of all salesmen . Since McKeon regarded him as a hopeful swindler , Van had no scruples in urging the Itascas on him . McKeon kept him waiting an hour in the anteroom without a pretense of being seriously engaged , for he was in and out of the anteroom a dozen times fussing with his secretary about a mislaid voucher . At the first mention of Mike Vaihinger , McKeon cut Van off and refused to waste any more valuable time . At the top of his voice , Van vainly re-minded the old gentleman of the youthful career of E. H. Harriman . McKeon shut him off . Vaihinger was too young and green for any of his money . Being turned down nettled and aroused Van . He went after Selden next . Selden was vice-president of American Synthetics , Inc. , and Van disliked him because usually he was unable to make up his mind and took up a salesman 's time and attention with his own troubles . Every once in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ten bonds . Van could never discern any particular shrewdness in his choices . Selden kept him waiting and then was wearisomely undecided about the Itascas . He worried over the markets and the cotton crop and complained to Van about his wife 's extravagance and his September fuel oil bill . It was plainly not one of Seidea 's inexplicable buying days . Van was disgusted . He expected business men to be businesslike . McKeon and Selden had taken the afternoon and he got back to the office late . Schaeffer put him on the carpet . He had sold five bonds in three days . On past performance  --  he was seventh in volume for the preceding year  --  he should have disposed of his quota . Saying that he could n't sell would n't wash . Vanderberg was lying down on the job . Van explained that Schaeffer had him all wrong and related his afternoon with McKeon and Selden . Schaeffer said he was n't interested in calls . He wanted sales . He wanted Van functioning again . Back at his desk , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was in conference with Schaeffer . He tore the slip up and threw the pieces in the wastebasket . He still was not touching the damned Itascas , but failure with McKeon and Selden was giving him a superstitious apprehension that his powers of salesmanship , having been briefly perverted , were slipping away from him . That evening he was moody and restless . Miriam did not understand high finance but from Van 's subdued appre-pension she took high alarm . He was not earning commissions ; their income had stopped ; he was antagonizing that nice Mr. Schaeffer , making people mistrustful of him , jeopardizing his career , and all over some silly old bonds . She remembered Dr. Bevans and insisted that Van call on him in the morning . Van had to admit that he had not spoiled his chances there as he had with his other customers . Miriam applied Delisle 's advice . If he would get rid of ten of the awful trouble-making things to Dr. Bevans he would not have Mr. Schaeffer calling him names , with a mad on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth tight and her arms severely folded . " You 've gone and taken a mean streak about this business , " she scolded . " I can just see it . I know how you are . You wo n't listen to reason . You wo n't listen to anyone 's else point of view . Oh , no . Things have to be your way . That 's why you 're in all this trouble . " Van stolidly cleaned his pipe . " I 'm not in any trouble . " Miriam shivered in a fury of exasperation . " Oh , ohl Being lectured by Mr. Schaeffer is n't any trouble , is it ? And being reported to Mr. MacArthur is n't any trouble , is it ? And having your friends called in to reason with you , as Mr. Delisle 's done , is n't any trouble , is it ? Oh , not You 're in a heap of trouble . You 're just too stubborn , you 're too like a mule , to see your trouble . That 's all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think anyone 's going to respect you when you 're fired for these highfalutin ' fancy reasons of yours ? No indeedy . They 'll say what a fool you were . That 's what they 'll say . And do you think that Dr. Bevans will ever thank you ? No he wo n't . He 's no friend of ours . He 's got no call on us . " She snatched the pipe-cleaner from his hand and brandished it for complete attention . " You 're just going to queer yourself . You 're just going to fix it so I 'll never have Ruby and we 'll never have children or anything . You 're just going to make them hate you . They 'll hate you . You ca n't do it , Van . We 're just starting out . We 've got to be sensible . We 've got to have money . Now you , you honey , you be sensible . They 'll hate you , they 'll hate you . You do like I say . " She threw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persisted in refusing and they quarreled , but the next morning , despite his refusal , he called on Mr. Simjian and then being in the neighborhood , he called on Dr. Bevans . Dr. Bevans ' offices were on East 68th Street , off Park Avenue , and he had Van shown into his narrow , cramped , private inner room and came in a moment afterward , florid and professional , in a double-breasted oxford-gray coat . " I have left a patient , a neurasthenic , " he explained , and after shaking hands , retained Vanderberg , holding Van 's upper arm between his thumb and fingers . " She will not enjoy waiting . What is it , Van ? We must be quick . I am supposed to be talking with a colleague on the telephone . " " It 's about replacing those Portland Electrics that mature next month . I think I 've found what you want and we need n't wait for the maturity date . I can get you the full price and accumulated interest on the Portland Electrics and turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exasperated scrape of a chair from the adjoining room and , drawing Van by the arm , moved stealthily to the connecting door and listened , a set slight smile concentrated on his lips . The scrape was repeated . " Shall I come back later ? " Van whispered . Dr. Bevans shook his head , listened a moment longer , then shook hands again and said hurriedly : " You know what it is I want . We 've talked it over . If you recommend these , put it through . I must get back . " " I was going to suggest ? " Van began , but Dr. Bevans at the door lifted his forefinger peremptorily for silence . The door opened and closed . Dr. Bevans ' THE BOND solid , reassuring tread advanced across the adjoining room . Riding back to the office on the subway , Vanderberg kept trying to tell himself that the Itascas were sound enough , that the Buying Department was probably right after all , that he had been misjudging them . Schaeffer was right in that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps he ought to trust the Buying Department . If only the bonds had been priced lower  --  even one or two points lower . If only Vaihinger 's structure were n't so pyramided , his properties so scattered . But if he did n't put Dr. Bevans ' order through it was going to be difficult to dispose of a few bonds now , as De/isle advised , because he had already tipped off all his likely customers . He would have to cold-canvass , sell them cold . He could have Bevans sell the bonds later . But the market would probably float away when the support was withdrawn . There would be more trouble if he were detected having Bevans throw the bonds back . By that time the pressure would have let up . Should he or should n't he ? Bevans ' order was still discretionary . He had n't sold Bevans twenty Itascas until the order was in . Bevans trusted him . Bevans was a damn fool of the first water to trust a salesman . Van was pro-yoked . No more responsibility for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? On his desk , a memo requested him to see Mr. Schaeffer as soon as he came in . Almost at once his telephone rang . Mr. Schaeffer wanted to see him immediately . Van swore grumpily . At least he was going to let Schaeffer blow up and turn purple a couple of times before he sprang the Bevans order . Schaeffer was standing , drumming impatiently with his fingers , when he came in . " What 's your explanation for this ? " he demanded , throwing a slip of paper at Vanderberg . The paper crackled in the air , looped , and sailed swiftly over the heads of three pushed-back telephones , past the edge of the desk , to the floor . Van picked it up . It was the carbon triplicate confirmation of the sale by EIeazar Adams of five Itasca bonds to Commonweal the day before . Instead of taking the bonds , Adams had thrown them back on the market and the supporting syndicate had had to repurchase them . " What kind of selling is that ? " shouted Schaeffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sells them back to us on Wednesday . That 's a marvellous job of selling , Vanderberg . By God , that 's one commission you 'll never collect . What kind of rinky-clink is this ? Are you selling bonds or are you playing tag ? " He angered Van . " I earn my commis ? sions , " he said . " And if there 's any rinky-dink going on , I 'm not in on it . As for this , " he dropped the Adams confirmation back on Schaeffer 's desk , " I 've talked to Adams like a Dutch uncle half a dozen times , reassuring him . Apparently it was n't enough . I do n't know what happened  --  I 'll find out  --  but if you want my guess , somebody from City Bankers got to him and gave him the lowdown on these Itascas . The lowdown scared him and he sold them . That 's all that happened . " Schaeffer rammed his head forward accusingly . " You advised Adams to sell . " " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not . " " Ever since I jumped on you in meeting the other morning , you 've been laying down , Vanderberg , sulking . It 's a kid trick , let me tell you . You 've got to learn to take criticism . Sulking 's a hell of a way for a grown man to be acting . " " If you think for one minute that that 's the reason ? " " All right , " Schaeffer challenged , " what is the reason ? " " The reason ? " Van began and stopped . The muscles tightened obstinately round his eyes . Schaeffer was trying to trap him into an argument . " What do you mean by the lowdown on these Itascas ? " " You know what I mean . " " Overpriced , eh ? That story . " Schaeffer 's entire face twitched with sarcasm . " I 'm not selling my customers bonds they stand to lose money on . Damn you , Schaeffer . People trust me . The people that trust me I can sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not going to sell Itascas to people that trust me . " " I do n't give a hang who you sell them to . You 're going to sell Itascas if you work for Commonweal . " " Am I ? " Van 's anger spurted recklessly . He abruptly reached over and picked up one of the telephones . He had had enough of Schaeffer 's bullying domination , and in the reckless spurting of his anger he had found the thing to do . His upper lip receded to a tight stiff line . " I 'm not bragging about my conscience . It 's a lot more pliable than it should be . It can be led , but there 's one thing about it , Schaeffer , it ca n't be driven . I 've bad enough . " " What are you doing ? " Van yelled sharply into the transmitter . " Get me Dr. Bevans on East 68th Street . " He had to repeat it . Then he lifted his head and clutching the telephone , for a moment , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schaeffer . " I came in here with a discretionary order for twenty Itascas , but I 'm cancelling it . I 've had enough . " Schaeffer 's disturbed , questioning , pursy , worried glance changed like the swift opening of an eye . He moved with startling quickness . He grabbed a second telephone . " Disregard that call , " he commanded the switchboard . Van heard his plug disconnected . " Damn you . " There was a fierce bursting moment . He wanted to strike Schaeffer . But the older man had changed , he was supplicating , soothing , placating . " Now listen , Van , " he urged . " Listen . You 're excited , Van . Cool off . I 'm not trying to drive you . You can put your call through in a minute . But sit down and think it over . Cool off first . " " Damn you , " Van muttered again , but he sat down and , posting the telephone on his crossed knee , he tipped the chair backangrily against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his substantial mouth set adamantly . There was a silence , full of compressed , misshapen minutes . Schaeffer unconcernedly busied himself , lighted a cigarette thoughtfully , made notations on his desk pad , filed away the Adams confirmation slip . He disregarded Van and left the matter to the whispering , cautioning , fleering cynicism of abundant time . Finally in a subdued voice he called and asked Mr. MacArthur to come down . Then thoughtfully smoking , he sauntered round the desk and sat down on the edge near Vander berg . He delayed a minute . " You 've come along fast , Van , " he remarkedwith his put sy , overt smile , frankly appraising but friendly , almost fatherly in his encouragement . " You 've a bright future . Almost unlimited promise . You 're being watched , Van . We expect big things of you . But you must believe in us . Commonweal 's a house you can trust , boy . Trust the Buying Department . Trust the whole house . I want you to believe in us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground out the cigarette and went on more aggressively . " You 're green , Van , still green . There 's a reason why young salesmen are n't sitting up on high dictating to the Buying De . partment . You do n't learn how to price bonds in three-weeks bond-school or crashing private offices . Pricing bonds takes training  --  and experience . Training and experience you have n't had . You 're a seller , Van , a good little seller , but do n't get illusions . Do n't let your head float away from your shoulders . Keep connected , Van . " He droned on , derogating , encouraging , reasonable . Van 's tense lips and cheeks had sunken sullenly . The telephone sagged in his lap . He apathetically listened and despised himself . MacArthur came in , an undersized man , the lens of his pince-nez disproportionately large and glittering above his hollow receding face . Nodding casually , Schaeffer turned on MacArthur the same cajoling flow , explaining that Mr. MacArthur THE BOND would be gratified to know that he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Van while Van stared at the floor . " Van thought we would n't allow him to protect one or two of his customers on these Itascas , but I 've made it clear that all we 're interested in is having him dispose of his quota . I think we 've got it all straightened out , have n't we , Van ? " Van started to lift his head but Schaeffer did not wait for agreement . There was one thing more . " Vanderberg 's landed a nice order , " and he prompted MacArthur with a tip and jerk of his head , " but he has n't turned it in yet . " " Whops the order from , Vanderberg ? " demanded MacArthur . He had a cutting , aloof voice . Van swallowed . He hated them both . " Bev ans . " He made MacArthur drag the information out of him , bit by bit . Schaeffer scribbled . At the number of shares , he exclaimed . " I thought you said twenty , Van . " " Ten , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Schaeffer , by a slight shake and a frown , cautioned MacArthur against comment . " Ten Itascas , " he said genially , writing .
