txt Mrs. Bertha Eckert Ewald , charged , together with her husband , George F. Ewald , with buying a magistracy , took the stand in her own defense yesterday , and for five hours under extensive direct and cross examination , insisted that she and her husband were innocent and flatly contradicted prosecution witnesses . Speaking in a voice that was at times almost inaudible in the crowded courtroom , she answered unfalteringly the questions of Sydney A. Syme , her counsel , and repeated for the first time in open court the story that she told before the county grand jury last August . While her husband listened from the defendant 's chair , and the jury and Justice Philip J. McCook , who Is presiding over the case in Trial Term , Part 1 , of the Supreme Court , leaned forward in their seats to hear her words , Mrs. Ewald declared that she did not know of her husband 's appointment as a magistrate until the day that he wag sword in . Tells of Loan to Healy . She explained the $10,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas T. Tommaney , former sheriff 's clerk and friend of the Ewalds , as a loan about which her husband knew nothing until three years after it was made . She gave the money to Tommaney at his request about the time of Ewald 's appointment in April , 1927 , she said , understanding that Healy wanted it to buy a house at Blue Point , L. I. In return for the loan , Tommaney signed a promisory non-interestbearing note , payable in five years , which was lost when the Ewalds moved , she testified . For about three hours , while Hiram C. Todd , special prosecutor , forced her to trace every detail of the transaction she stuck to this story without wavering . She unequivocally contradicted the testimony of Emmerich J. Boczer and Frank I. O'Neil , the State 's two key witnesses , who said she and her husband had admitted buying the post . At the end of the day Mrs. Ewald left the stand , her lips trembling and her voice weak and broken , but she smiled wanly as Mr. Syme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congratulate her . She will face another long ordeal today for Mr. Todd announced last night that he has many more questions to propound . The end of the trial , which seemed in sight Monday when the defense commenced to present its case , is still some days off , it was indicated , and neither side would predict that the case would be concluded this week . Mr. Syme said he has seventeen more wit- nesses , all of whom he hoped to call . Mr. Todd countered by stating that he expected to call " some " rebuttal witnesses . Mrs. Ewald 's testimony occupied the entire day yesterday except for a brief half hour in the morning when two bank representatives and two character witnesses were put on the stand . Mr. Syme 's preliminary questions to his client were routine and Mrs. Ewald answered brightly . Slowly the lawyer approached his subject . " I want to call your attention in connection with some testimony that has appeared here from the witness Boczor . " Mr. Syme commenced . " He told of a conversation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1929 . The conversation I refer to is one in which in substance he says you and your husband told him that $10,000 was paid to Healy and $2,000 to Dr. Schirp for the magistracy . Did any such conversation as that ever take place between you and your husband , or you individually , and Boczor ? " " Never , " Mrs. Ewald replied quietly . Mr. Syme quickly switched his attack to O'Neil , court attendant in General Sessions , and Mrs. Ewald denied in succession every assertion of O'Neil which tended to show that the court attendant had knowledge from the Ewalds of their alleged office-buying . Under the guidance of her lawyer Mrs. Ewald then told of borrowing $3,000 from her father , Peter Eckert , last Summer , giving it to O'Neil to retain a lawyer , because , she said , the court attendant told her " things looked very black for George . " After the Federal Grand Jury returned an indictment against her husband for his connection with the Cotter Butter Minee , Inc. , she said she asked O'Neil what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I gave it to Curran and Sylvester ? " " By Curran and Sylvester he meant Thomas Curran and Alvin . Sylvester , Assistant United States Attorney ? " Mr. Syme asked . " Yes , " Mrs. Ewald replied , " and he said : ' I gave Mr. Curran $2,1500 and Mr. Sylvester $500 . It 's cash and you ca n't prove it . " O'Neil bad previously denied . any . knowledge of such en incident . Mrs .. Ewald declared yesterday that she had never got the $3,000 back . Mrs. Ewald also denied that she had ever lent any money to Dr. Francis M. Schirp of the Steuben Society , who endorsed her husband 's candidacy . On cross-examination Mr. Todd drew from the witness that she did not tell her husband of the loan arid told Tommaney not to tell him .
