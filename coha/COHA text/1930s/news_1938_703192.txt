txt Darkness and storm . tonight halted searchers for a missing airliner and its six passsengers and crew of three soon after the sighting of mystery lights and a white object near a mountainside scar ' tin the area where the storm-battered plane was last reported last night . The scar , estimated . by searchers , who were a mile and a half away , to be 200 feet long , apparently was gouged out of the mountainside sixty miles east of here in the high Sierra . Unexplained lights were seen in the neighborhood of the mark and a white object , undistinguishable in the gathering gloom , lay at the bottom . Discovery of the possible clue was reported by a party of twenty persons , including newspaper men and two employes of Transcontinental &; Western Air , Inc. , operators of the big silvery plane . imaging storm waters in the north fork of the San Joaquin River prevented the party from crossing and approaching closer to the objects , but at daybreak they planned to fight their way- to the area .

Landry , wife of a power company official , who said she saw the ship at 9:30 last night . Mrs. Landry , apparently , WAS the last person to report sighting the big , twin-motored craft , which , when caught in a sudden fierce storm , turned back on an eastbound flight from San Francisco . An army bomber , one of several craft joining the search , flew over the area twenty miles east of here , where an unfamiliar tan object was reported sighted on a hill , but returned unable to find anything resembling the missing ship . Leaders of the hunt , some of them pessimistic over the fate of the missing plane 's occupants , prepared to widen the search from the ground and the air . Changed Course for a Storm ; Because a storm was coming from the south , the plane headed toward Los Angeles instead of Las Vegas , Nev. , on its regular course . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Northern and Southern California . John D. Graves , the pilot , on receiving directions to hunt an emergency landing , turned back toward the north . Apparently the plane hovered over the Fresno area for an hour or more , then began making widening circles as the storm crowded it gradually eastward into the craggy peaks of the Sierra Nevada Mountains , only a few miles from the ordinarily safe and warm valley . Many persons reported sighting a plane , ' possibly the distressed ship , east of Fresno . A highway crew at Shaver Lake reported hearing " a loud crash " and thought it be a clue to the plane 's fate . Aboard the $105,000 skylin passengers were Tracy Dirla - Mary Lou Dirlam , Stanford versity students ; Mr. and Mrs. L. B. Walls of San Francisco ; Victor Krause of Lincoln , Neb. , and H. N.

A. records in New York as 26 years old . She received her training as a nurse in Mount Sinai Hospital , Philadelphia . Her mother , Mrs. Clyde Dixon , lives in Bridgeport , Ohio . Pilot Graves was a flier of long experience , having achieved a record on mercy flights in the Southwest . On two occasions he flew supplies to snowbound and starving Hopi Indians in Arizona . More than five feet of snow lay on the ground at Huntington Lake but it was melting rapidly under a torrential rain which flooded sections of Southern California . Ordinarily snow remains on the ground at that altitude  --  about 5,000 feet ? until May .
