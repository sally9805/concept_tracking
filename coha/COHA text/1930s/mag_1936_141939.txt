The septuagenarian 's silky grey beard , spread over his hospital blanket , jerked each time he gasped the oxygen which an electric motor blew upon his face . Another midnight passed , and attendants of Brooklyn 's Jewish Hospital left Aaron Handler , dying of heart disease , alone for a while . Then a dull boom from his room recalled nurses and interns on a dead run . They found Aaron Handler 's beard a shriveling , stinking torch fanned by the breeze of oxygen . Whether the electric pump emitted a combustive spark , or whether his beard generated a spark by rubbing against the woolen blanket will never be known . Aaron Handler died silently of burns , shock and heart failure . <P> Commented Dr. Alvan Leroy Barach , Manhattan pneumotherapist who is largely responsible for the use of oxygen to treat weak hearts ( TIME , April 6 , 1931 ) : " Accidents from fire in oxygen tents or in oxygen rooms are extremely rare . When they do occur , they are caused by some reckless action on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man must have lit a cigaret . The theory that a spark might have flown from the motor over to the oxygen tent is untenable . " <P> In another section of Brooklyn last week another useful gas manifested its deadly potentialities . Carbon dioxide , condensed to dry ice , was used to refrigerate a cargo of cherries shipped from Buffalo to Brooklyn . Not reflecting that dry ice evaporates to carbon dioxide gas again , that carbon dioxide in an unventilated room displaces oxygen without which no man can live , and that it is therefore a modern occupational hazard , two Brooklyn stevedores descended into the ship 's hold to unload cases of cherries . They had time only to cry alarm before they dropped unconscious . Three other stevedores who went to the rescue also suffocated . All five were dead before they could be lifted to fresh air .
