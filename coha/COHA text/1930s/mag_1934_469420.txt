NO VEt14 BER II th . Reach To- ronto at preposterous hour of 5.55 A.M. and decide against night-traveling once and forever , day having actually started with Customs inspection considerably before dawn . Decide to try to see what I can of Canada and glue my face to the window , but nothing visible for a long while . Am finally rewarded by superb sunrise , but eyelids feel curiously stiff and intelligence at lowest possible ebb . Involve myself in rather profound train of thought regarding dependence of artistic perception upon physical conditions , but discover in the midst of it that I am having a nightmare about the children both being drowned , and have dropped two books and one glove . Colored porter appears with clothesbrush and is evidently convinced that I can not possibly present myself to Canadian inspection without previously submitting to his ministrations . As I feel that he is probably right , I stand up and am rather half-heartedly dealt with , and then immediately sit down again , no doubt in original collection of dust , and weakly present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgusted . Train stops , and I get out of it , and find myself ? as so often before ? surrounded by luggage on strange and ice-cold platform , only too well aware that I probably look even more degomm ? e than I feel . Canadian host and hostess , with great good feeling , have both turned out to meet me , and am much impressed at seeing that neither cold nor early rising has impaired complexion of my hostess . Find myself muttering quotation : Alike to her were time and tide , November 's snow and July 's pride . but Canadian host , Mr. Lee , says Did I speak ? and I have to say No , no , nothing at all , and remind myself that talking aloud to oneself is well-known preliminary to complete mental breakdown . Make really desperate effort , decide that I am awake and that the day has begun ? began , in fact , several hours ago ? and that if only I am given a cup of very strong coffee quite soon , I shall very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lee looks kind , Mrs. Lee ? evidently several years younger ? is cheerful and good-looking , and leads the way to small car waiting outside station . This appears to me to be completely filled already by elderly lady in black , large dog , and little girl with pigtails . These , I am told , arc the near neighbors of the Lees . Should like to ask why this compels them to turn out at four o'clock in the morning in order to meet complete stranger , but do not , naturally , do so . Explanation is presently proffered , to the effect that the Falls of Niagara are only eighty miles away , and I am to visit them at once , and the little girl ? Minnie ? has never seen them either , so it seemed a good opportunity . Minnie , at this , jumps up and down the seat and has to be told to Hush , dear . Her mother adds that Minnie is very highly strung . She always has been , and her mother is afraid she always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at nine yeaxs old , the brain of a child of fifteen . I look at Minnie , who at once assumes an interesting expression and puts her head on one side , at which I immediately look away again , and feel that I am not going to like Minnie . ( This impression definitely gains ground as day goes on . ) Mrs. Lee , on the other hand , earns gratitude almost amounting to affection by saying that I must have breakfast and a bath before anything else , and that both these objectives can be obtained on the way to Niagara . I ask what about my luggage ? and am told that a friend of some cousins living near Hamilton has arranged to call for it later and convey it to Mr. Lee 's house . Am impressed , and decide that mutual readiness to oblige must be a feature of Canadian life . Make mental note to develop this theme when talking to Women 's Institute at home . At this point Minnie 's mother suddenly asks What we are all here for if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her part , her motto has always been : Lend a Hand . Revulsion of feeling at once overtakes me , and I abandon all idea of impressing the Women 's Institute with the desirability of mutual good will . Car takes us at great speed along admirable roads ? very tight squeeze on back seat , and Minnie kicks me twice on the shins and puts her elbow into my face once ? and we reach house standing amongst trees . Is this , I civilly inquire of Mrs. Lee , her home ? Oh dear no . The Lees live right on the other side of Toronto . This is Dr. MacAfie 's place , where we are all having breakfast . And a bath , adds Mrs. L. , looking at me compassionately . Dr. MacAfie and his wife both turn out to be Scotch . They receive us kindly , and Mrs. L. at once advocates the bathroom for me . Bath is a success , and I come down very hungry , convinced that it must be nearer lunch-time than breakfast-time . Clock , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counting up number of hours that must elapse before I can hope to find myself in bed and asleep . Results of this calculation very discouraging . Breakfast , which is excellent , restores me , and we talk about America ? the States very unlike Canada ? the Dominions ? life in Canada very like life in the Old Country ? snow very early this year ? and my impressions of Chicago World 's Fair . Minnie interrupts a good deal , and says Need she eat bacon , and If she went on a big ship to England she knows she 'd be very sick . At this everybody laughs ? mine very perfunctory indeed ? and her mother says that really , the things that child says . . . and it 's always been like that , ever since she was a tiny tot . Anecdotes of Minnie 's infant witticisms follow , and I inwardly think of all the much more brilliant remarks made by Robin and Vicky . Should much like an opportunity for retailing these , and do my best to find one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Expedition to Niagara ensues , and I am told on the way that it is important for me to see the Falls from the Canadian side , as this is greatly superior to the American side . Can understand this , in a way , as representing point of view of my present hosts , but hope that inhabitants of Buffalo , where I go next , will not prove equally pa triotic and again conduct me immense distances to view phenomenon all over again . Am , however , greatly impressed by Falls , and say so freely . Mr. Lee tells me that I really ought to see them by night , when lit up by electricity , and Mrs. Lee says No , that vulgarizes them completely , and I reply Yes to both of them , and Minnie 's mother asks What Minnie thinks of Niagara , to which Minnie squeaks out that she wants her dinner right away this minute , and we accordingly proceed to the hotel . Buy a great many post cards . Minnie watches this transaction closely , and says that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with one of mine , and her mother says that I am really much too kind ? with which I inwardly agree . This opinion intensified on return journey , when Minnie decides to sit on my Tap , and asks me long series of complicated questions , such as Would I rather be an alligator who did n't eat people , or a man who had to make his living by stealing , or a tiny little midget in a circus ? Reply to these and similar conundrums more or less in my sleep , and dimly hear Minnie 's mother telling me that Minnie looks upon her as being just a great , big , elder sister , and always tells her everything just as it pops into her little head , and do n't I feel that it 's most important to have the complete confidence of one 's children ? Can only think , at the moment , that it 's most important to have a proper amount of sleep . Mr. Lee 's house is eventually attained , and proves to be outside Toronto . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and say that they will be popping in quite soon , and I get out of car and discover that I am alarmingly stiff , very cold , and utterly exhausted . Am obliged to confess this state of affairs to Mrs. Lee , who is very kind , and advises bed . Can only apologize , and do as she suggests . November 12th . Spend comparatively quiet day , and feel better . Host and hostess agree that I must remain indoors , and as it snows violently I thankfully do so , and write very much over-due letters . Quiet afternoon and evening of conversation . Mr. Lee wants to know about the Royal Family ? of which , unfortunately , I can tell him little except what he can read for himself in the papers ? and Mrs. Lee asks if I play much bridge . She does n't , she adds hastily , mean on Sundays . Am obliged to reply that I play very little on any day of the week , but try to improve this answer by adding that my husband is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do I garden ? No ? unfortunately not . Mrs. Lee seems disappointed , but supposes indulgently that writing a book takes up quite a lot of time , and I admit that it does , and we leave it at that . Am rather disposed , after this effort , to sit and ponder on extreme difficulty of ever achieving continuity of conversation when in the society of complete strangers . Idle fancy crosses my mind that Mr. Alexander Woollcott would make nothing of it at all , and probably conduct whole conversation all by himself with complete success . Wonder ? still more idly ? if I shall send him a post caul about it , and whether he would like one of Niagara . November 12th ( continued ) . Main purpose of Canadian visit ? which is small lecture ? safely accomplished . Audience kind , rather than enthusiastic . Mrs. Lee says that she could tell I was nervous . Can not imagine more thoroughly discouraging comment than this . Mr. Lee very kindly takes me to visit tallest building in the British Empire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board-rooms , offices , and finally vaults , situated in basement and behind enormous steel doors , said to weigh incredible number of tons and only to be opened by two people working in conjunction . I ask to go inside , and am aghast when I do so by alarming notice on the wall which tells me that If I get shut into the vaults by accident I am not to be alarmed , as there is a supply of air for several hours . Do not at all like the word " several , " which is far from being sufficiently specific , and have horrid visions of being shut into the vaults and spending my time there in trying to guess exactly when " several " may be supposed to be drawing to an end . Inquire whether anyone has ever been locked into the vaults , and if they came out mad , but Mr. Lee only replies No one that he has ever heard of , and appears quite unmoved by the idea . Have often associated banking with callousness , and now perceive how right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until 9 o'clock , when Minnie and parent descend upon us and we all talk about Minnie for about half an hour . Take cast-iron resolution before I sleep never to make either of the dear children subjects of long conversations with strangers . ( Mem : To let Robert know of this resolution , as feel sure he would approve of it . ) November 13th . Five o'clock train is selected to take me to Buffalo , and am surprised and relieved to find that I have not got to travel all night , but shall arrive in four-and-a-half hours . Luncheon party is kindly given in my honor by the Lees ? Minnie not present , but is again quoted extensively by her mother ? and I am asked more than once for opinion on relative merits of Canada and the United States . Can quite see that this is very delicate ground , and have no intention whatever of committing myself to definite statement on the point . Talk instead about English novelists ? Kipling evidently very popular , and Hugh Walpole looked upon as interesting new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ought to go to Quebec . As it is now impossible for me to do so , this leads to very little , beyond repeated assurances from myself that I should like to go to Quebec , and am exceedingly sorry not to be going there . One well-informed lady tells me that Harold Nicolson went there and liked it very much . Everybody receives this in respectful silence , and I feel that Harold Nicolson has completely deflated whatever wind there may ever have been in my sails . Morale is restored later by my host , who takes me aside and says that I have been Just a breath of fresh air from the Old Country , and that I must come again next year . Am touched , and recklessly say that I will . Everyone says good-by very kindly , and gentleman ? hitherto unknown ? tells me that he will drive me to the station , as he has to go in that direction later . Minnie 's mother heaps coals of fire on my head by telling me that she has a little present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street to get it . This she does , and present turns out to be a Service revolver , which she thinks my boy may like . Can reply with perfect truth that I feel sure of it , and am fortunately not asked for my own reaction or Robert 's . Revolver , of which I am secretly a good deal afraid , is wedged with the utmost difficulty into the least crowded corner of my attache-case , and I take my departure . Rather strange sequel follows a good deal later , when I am having dinner on train and am called out to speak to Customs official . Can not imagine what he wants me for , and alarming visions of Sing Sing assail me instantly . Go so far as to decide that I shall try to brief Mr. Clarence Darrow for the defense ? but this probably because he is the only American barrister whose name I can remember . Customs awaits me in the corridor , and looks very grave . Is mine , he inquires , the brown attache-case under the fur coat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why , may he ask , do I find it necessary to travel with a revolver ? Freakish impulse momentarily assails me , and I nearly ? but not quite ? reply that I have to do so for the protection of my virtue . Realize in time that this flippancy would be quite out of place , and might very likely land me in serious trouble , so take wiser and more straightforward course of telling Customs the whole story of the Service revolver . He receives it sympathetically , and tells me that he is a family man himself . Conversation follows , in which I learn names and ages of the whole family of Customs , and in return show him small snapshot of Robin and Vicky with dog Kolynos , playing in the garden . Customs says That 's a fine dog , and asks what breed , but says nothing about R. and V. Am slightly disappointed , but have noticed similar indifference to the children of others on the part of parents before . November 13th ( continued ) . Train , in the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Large and very handsome station receives me , and I walk about vast hall , which I seem to have entirely to myself . Red-capped porter , who is looking after my luggage , seems prepared to remain by it forever in a fatalistic kind of way , and receives with indifference my announcement that Someone will be here to meet me by-and-by . Can only hope I am speaking the truth , but feel doubtful as time goes on . Presently , however , tall lady in furs appears , and looks all round her , and I say " Dr. Livingstone , I presume ? " ? but not aloud ? and approach her . Am I , I ask , speaking to Mrs. Walker ? Lady , in a most uncertain voice , replies No , no ? not Mrs. Walker . We gaze at each other helplessly and she adds , in a still more uncertain voice ; Mrs. Luella White Clarkson . To this I can think of no better reply than Oh , and we walk away from each other in silence , only , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Should much like to know what peculiar law governs this state of affairs . Station is perfectly enormous , and practically empty , and neither Mrs. L.W.C. nor myself has the slightest wish ever again to come face to face with each other , yet we seem perfectly unable to avoid doing so . Eventually take to turning my back whenever I see her approaching , and walking smartly in the opposite direction . ) Mental comparison of American and English railway stations follows , and am obliged to admit that America wins hands down . Have never in my life discovered English station that was warm , clean , or quiet , or at which waiting entailed anything but complete physical misery . Compose long letter to Sir Felix Pole on the subject , and have just been publicly thanked by the Lord Mayor of London for ensuing reformations , when I perceive Redcap making signs . Mrs. Walker ? small lady in black , very smart , and no resemblance whatever to Mrs. L.W.C.-has appeared . She apologizes very nicely for being late , and I apologize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's having been too early ? and we get into her motor which is , as usual , very large and magnificent . ( Remarkable contrast between cars to which I am by now becoming accustomed and ancient Standard so frequently pushed up the hills at home ? but have little doubt that I shall be delighted to THE PROVINCIAL find myself in old Standard once more . ) Have I , Mrs. Walker instantly inquires , visited the Falls of Niagara ? Am obliged to admit , feeling apologetic , that I have . Thank God for that , she surprisingly returns . We then embark on conversation , and I tell her about Canada , and make rather good story out of preposterous child Minnie . Mrs. Walker is appreciative , and we get on well . Buffalo is under snow , and bitterly cold . House , however , delightfully warm , as usual . Mrs. Walker hopes that I wo n't mind a small room : I perceive that the whole of drawing-room , dining room , and Robert 's study could easily be fitted inside it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one end and a sitting room the other , and say , Oh no , not in the least . She then leaves me to rest . November 14th . Become apprehensive toward afternoon , when Mrs. W. tells me that the Club at which I am to lecture has heard all the bestknown European speakers , at one time or another , and is composed of highly cultivated members . Revise my lecture frantically , perceive that it is totally lacking in cultivation , or even ordinary evidence of intelligence , and ask Mrs. W. whether she does n't think the Club would like a reading instead . Have no real hope that this will succeed , nor does it . Nothing for it but to put on my newly ironed blue , powder my nose , and go . Mrs. W. is considerate , and does not attempt conversation on the way , except when she once says that she hopes I can eat oysters . Feel it highly improbable that I shall ever be able to eat anything again , and hear myself muttering for sole reply : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " World , needless to say , does not end , and I have to pull myself together , meet a great many Club members ? alert expressions and very expensive clothes ? and subsequently mount small platform on which stand two chairs , table , and reading-desk . Elderly lady in gray takes the chair ? reminds me of Robert 's Aunt Eleanor , but can not say why ? and says that she is not going to speak for more than a few moments . Everyone , she knows , is looking forward to hearing something far more interesting than any words of hers can be . At this she glances benevolently toward me , and smile modestly , and wish I could drop down in a fit and be taken away on the spot . Instead , I have presently to get on to my feet , and adjust small sheet of notes ? now definitely looking crumpled and dirty ? on to reading-desk . Head , as usual , gets very hot , and feet very cold , and am badly thrown off my balance by very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand to her ear throughout , as if unable to hear a word I utter . This , however , evidently not the case , as she comes up afterward and tells me that she was one of the Club 's original members , and has never missed a single lecture . Offer her my congratulations on this achievement , and then wish I had n't , as it sounds conceited , and add that I hope she has found it worth the trouble . She replies rather doubtfully Yes ? on the whole , Yes ? and refers to Andre Maurois . His lecture was positively brilliant . I reply , truthfully , that I feel sure it was , and we part . Aunt Eleanor and I exchange polite speeches ? I meet various ladies , one of whom tells me that she knows a great friend of mine . Rose , I suggest ? No , not Rose . Dear Katherine Ellen Blatt , who is at present in New York , but hopes to be in Boston when I am . She has , says the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been saying the most wonderful things about me . Try to look more grateful than I really feel , over this . ( Query : Does not public life , even on a small scale , distinctly lead in the direction of duplicity ? Answer , unfortunately , Yes . ) Conversation with Aunt Eleanor ensues She does not , herself , write books , she says , but those who do have always had a strange fascination for her . She has often thought of writing a book ? many of her friends have implored her to do so , in fact ? but no , she finds it impossible to begin . And yet , there are many things in her life about which whole , entire novels might well be written . Everybody devotes a moment of rather awed silence to conjecturing the nature of Aunt Eleanor 's singular experiences , and anti-climax is felt to have ensued when small lady in rather frilly frock suddenly announces in a pipy voice that she has a boy cousin , living in Oklahoma , who once wrote something for The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This more or less breaks up the party , and Mrs. Walker drives me home again , and says in a rather exhausted way that she thanks Heaven that 's over . Dinner-party closes the day , and I put on backless evening dress , add coatee , take coatee off again , look at myself with mirror and handglass in conjunction , resume coatee , and retain it for the rest of the evening . November 15th . Weather gets colder and colder as I approach Boston , and this rouses prejudice in me , together with repeated assurances from everybody I meet to the effect that Boston is the most English town in America , and I shall simply adore it . Feel quite unlike adoration as train takes me through snowy country , and affords glimpses of towns that appear to be entirely composed of Gasoline Stations and Motion-Picture Theaters . Toward nine o'clock in the morning , I have an excellent breakfast ? food in America definitely a very bright spot ? and return to railway-carriage where I see familiar figure , hat still worn at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's representative . Feel as if I had met my oldest friend , in the middle of a crowd of strangers , and we greet each other cordially . Pete tells me that I seem to be standing up to it pretty well ? which I take to be a compliment to my powers of endurance ? and unfolds terrific programme of the activities he has planned for me in Boston . Assent to everything , but add that the thing I want to do most of all , is to visit the Alcott House at Concord , Mass . At this Pete looks astounded , and replies that this is , he supposes , merely a personal fancy , and so far as he knows no time for anything of that kind has been allowed in the schedule . Am obliged to agree that it probably has n't , but repeat that I really want to do that more than anything else in America . ( Much later on , compose eloquent and convincing speech , to the effect that I have worked very hard and done all that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gratify my own wishes for one afternoon at least . Am quite clear that if I had only said all this at the time , Pete would have been left without a leg to stand upon . Unfortunately , however , I do not do so . ) Boston is reached ? step out of the train into the iciest cold that it has ever been my lot to encounter ? and am immediately photographed by unknown man carrying camera and unpleasant little light-bulb which he flashes unexpectedly into my eyes . No one makes the slightest comment on this proceeding , and am convinced that he has mistaken me for somebody quite different . Two young creatures from the 13 o t o n Transcript meet me , and inquire , more or less instantly , what I feel about the Problem of the American Woman , but Pete , with great good feeling , suggests that we should discuss it all in taxi on our way to Hotel , which we do . One of them then hands me a cable ( announcing death of Robin or Vicky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , in effect , that I must at all costs get into touch with Caroline Concannon 's dear friend and cousin Mona , who lives in Pinckney Street , would love to meet me , has been written to , everything all right at flat , love from Caroline . Am quite prepared to get into touch with dear friend and cousin , but say nothing to Pete about it , for fear of similar disconcerting reaction to that produced by suggestion of visiting Alcott House . Am conducted to nice little hotel in Charles Street , and told once by Pete , and twice by each of the Boston Transcript young ladies , that I am within a stone 's throw of the Common . Chief association with the Common is An Old-Fashioned Girl , in which heroine goes tobogganing , but do not refer to this , and merely reply that That is very nice . So it may he , but not at the moment when Common , besides being deep in snow , is quite evidently being searched from end to end by ice-Iaden northeast wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now accustomed , says that he will leave me to unpack but come and fetch me again in an hour 's time , to visit customary book-shops . Telephone bell in sitting room soon afterward rings , and it appears that dear Rose ? Iike Caroline Concannonhas a friend in Boston , and that the friend is downstairs and proposes to come up right away and see me . I say Yes , Yes , and I shall be delighted , and hastily shut suit-cases which I have this moment opened , and look at myself in the glass instead . Results of this inspection are far from encouraging , but nothing can be done about it now , and can only con centrate on trying to remember everything that Rose has ever told me about her Boston friend , called , I believe , Fanny Mason . Sum total of my recollections is that the friend is very literary , and has written a good deal , and traveled all over the world , and is very critical . Am rather inclined to become agitated by all this , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these disquieting attributes well out of sight , and concentrate on welcoming me very kindly to Boston ( exactly like England and all English people always love it on that account ) and inquiring affectionately about Rose . ( Am disgusted to learn from what she says that dear Rose has written to her far more recently , as well as at much greater length , than to myself . Shall have a good deal to say to Rose , when we meet again . ) Friend then announces that she has A Girl downstairs . The Girl has brought a car , and is going to show me Boston this morning , take me to lunch at a Women 's Club , and to a tea later . This more than kind , but also definitely disconcerting in view of arrangements made by Pete , and I say 0 Miss Mason ? and then stop , rather like heroine of a Victorian novel . Miss M. at once returns that I must not dream of calling her anything but Fanny . She has heard of me for years and years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls for thanks and acknowledgments on my part , and I then explain that publishers ' representative is in Boston , and calling for me in an hour 's time , which I 'm afraid means that I can not take advantage of kind offer . Miss M. ? Fanny ? undefeated , and says it is Important that I should see Boston , no one who has not done so can be said to know anything whatever about America , and The Girl is waiting for me downstairs . Suggestmostly in order to gain time ? that The Girl should be invited to come up , and this is done by telephone . She turns out to be very youthful and good-Iooking blonde , introduced to me as " Leslie " ( first names evidently the fashion in Boston ) and evidently prepared to take me anywhere in the world , more or less , at any moment . Explain all over again about Pete and the booksellers . Fanny remains adamant , but Leslie says reasonably : What about to-morrow instead , and I advance cherished scheme for visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with difficulties , as Alcott House is impenetrably shut at this time of year . Feel that if Pete comes to hear of this , my last hope is gone . Leslie looks rather sorry for me , and says perhaps something could be arranged , but anyway I had better come out now and see Boston . Fanny is also urgent on this point and I foresee deadlock , when telephone rings and Pete is announced , and is told to come upstairs . Brilliant idea then strikes me , I introduce everybody , and tell Pete that there has been rather a clash of arrangements , but that doubtless he and Miss Mason can easily settle it between themselves . Will they , in the meanwhile , excuse me , as I positively must see about my unpacking ? Retreat firmly into the bedroom to do so , but spend some of the time with ear glued to the wall , trying to ascertain whether Pete and Miss M. ? both evidently very strong personalities ? are going to fly at each other 's throats or not . Voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but nothing more formidable happens , and I hope that physical violence may be averted . Decide that on the whole I am inclined to back Pete , as possessing rocklike quality of immovability once his mind is made up ? doubtless very useful asset in dealing with authors , publishers , and so on . Subsequent events prove that I am right , and Pete walks me to book-shop , with laconic announcement to Leslie and Miss M. ? Fanny ? that I shall be at their disposal by 12:30 . November 16th . Most extraordinary revolution in everybody 's outlook ? excepting my own ? by communication from Mr. Alexander Woollcott ? He has , it appears , read in a paper ( Boston Transcript ? ) that my whole object in coming to America was to visit the Alcott House , and of this he approves to such an extent that he is prepared to Mention It in a Radio Talk , if I will immediately inform him of my reactions to the expedition . Entire volte-face now takes place in attitude of Pete , Fanny , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit Alcott House , it apparently becomes essential that I should do so and Heaven and earth must , if necessary , be moved in order to enable me to . Am much impressed by the remarkable difference between enterprise that I merely want to undertake for my own satisfaction , and the same thing when it is advocated by Mr. A.W . Result of it all is that the members of the Alcott-Pratt family are approached , they respond with the greatest kindness , and offer to open the house especially for my benefit , Fanny says that Leslie will drive me out to Concord on Sunday afternoon , and she will herself accompany us , not in order to view Alcott House ? she does not want to see it , which rather shocks me ? but to visit a relation of her own living there . Pete does not associate himself personally with the expedition , as he will by that time have gone to New York , Charlestown , Oshkosh , or some other distant spot ? but it evidently meets with his warmest approval , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper and pencil with me and THE PROVINCIAL send account of my impressions redhot to Mr. Alexander Woollcott . November 18th . Go to see football game , Harvard v. Army . Am given to understand ? and can readily believe ? that this is a privilege for which Presidents , Crowned Heads , and Archbishops would one and all give ten years of life at the very least . It has only been obtained for me by the very greatest exertions on the part of everybody . Fanny says that I shall be frozen ( can well believe it ) but that it will be worth it , and Leslie thinks I may find it rather difficult to follow ? but it will be worth it ? and they both agree that there is always a risk of pneumonia in this kind of weather . Wonder if they are going to add that it will still be worth it , because if so , shall disagree with them forcibly ? but they heap coals of fire on my head for this unworthy thought by offering to lend me rugs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided for me in the person of an admirer of Fanny 's ? name unknown to me from first to last ? and we set out together at one o'clock . Harvard stadium is enormous ? no roof , which I think a mistake ? and we sit in open air , and might be comfortable if temperature would only rise above zero . Fanny 's admirer is extremely kind to me , and can only hope he is n't thinking all the time how much pleasanter it would be if he were only escorting Fanny instead . Ask questions that I hope sound fairly intelligent , and listen attentively to the answers . Escort in return then paralyzes me by putting to me various technical points in regard to what he calls the English Came . Try frantically to recall everything that I can ever remember having heard from Robin , but am only able to recollect that he once said Soccer was absolutely lousy and that I rebuked him for it . Translate this painful reminiscence into civilized version to the effect that Rugger is more popular than Soccer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridden round the field by a member of one team or the other ? am not sure which ? and I observe , idiotically , that It 's like a Rodeo ? and immediately perceive that it is n't in the least , and wish I had n't spoken . Fortunately a number of young gentlemen in white suddenly emerge on to the ground , turn beautiful back somersaults in perfect unison , and cheer madly through a megaphone . Am deeply impressed , and assure Fanny 's admirer that we have nothing in the least like that at Wembley , Twickenham , nor , so far as I know , anywhere else . He agrees , very solemnly , that the cheers are a Great Feature of the Game . Soon afterwards we really get started , and I watch my first game of American football . Players all extensively padded and vast numbers of substituteplayers wait about in order to rush in and replace them when necessary . Altogether phenomenal number of these exchanges takes place , but as no stretchers visible , conclude that most of the injuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives me explanations about what is taking place from time to time , but is apt to break off in the middle of a phrase when excitement overcomes him . Other interruptions are occasioned by organized yellings and roarings , conducted from the field , in which the spectators join . At about four o'clock it is said to be obvious that Harvard has n't got a chance , and soon afterwards the Army is declared to have won . Escort and I look at each other and say Well , and Was n't it marvellous , and then stand up and I discover that I am quite unable to feel my feet at all , and that all circulation in the rest of my body has apparently stopped altogether ? probably frozen . We totter as best we can through the crowd ? escort evidently just as cold as I am , judging by the color of his face and hands ? and over bridge , past buildings that I am told are all part of the College , and to flat with attractive view across the river . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in store , I remain unaware throughout why I am being entertained there , or by whom . Hot tea , for once , is extraordinarily welcome , and so is superb log-fire ; and I talk to unknown , but agreeable , American about President Roosevelt , the state of the dollar ? we both take a gloomy view of this ? and extreme beauty of American foliage in the woods of Maine ? where I have never set foot , but about which 1 have heard a good deal . November 19th . Expedition to Concord ? now smiled upon by all , owing to intervention of dear Alexander W. ? takes place , and definitely ranks in my own estimation higher than anything else I have done in America . All is snow , silence , and loveliness , with frame-houses standing amongst trees , and no signs of either picturehouses , gasoline-stations , or hot-dog stalls . Can think of nothing but Little Women , and visualize scene after scene from well-remembered and beloved book . Fanny , sympathetic , but insensible to appeal of Little Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remain with Mrs. Pratt , surviving relative of Miss Alcott , and another elderly lady , both kind and charming , and prepared to show me everything there is to see . Could willingly remain there for hours and hours . Time , however , rushes by with its usual speed when I am absorbed and happy , and I am obliged to make my farewells , collect post cards and pictures with which I have most kindly been presented , and book given me for Vicky which I shall , I know , be seriously tempted to keep for myself . Can think of nothing but the March family for the remainder of the day , and am much annoyed at being reminded by Fanny and Leslie that whatever happens , I must send my impressions to Mr. Alexander Woollcott without delay . November 20th . Just as day of my departure from Boston arrives , weather relents and suddenly becomes quite mild . 1 go and call on Caroline Concannon 's friend , and am much taken with her . She has no party , which is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very amusing and good company , says the friend , and I agree , and add that Caroline is looking after my flat during my absence . Slight misgiving crosses my mind as to the literal accuracy of this statement , but this perhaps ungenerous , and make amends by saying that she is Very Good with Children ? which is perfectly true . Walk back across Common , and see very pretty brick houses , Queen Anne style . Old mauve glass in many window panes , but notice cynically that these always appear in ground-floor windows , where they can be most easily admired by the passers-by . Shock awaits me on return to hotel when I discover that Miss Katherine Ellen Blatt has just arrived , and has sent up a note to my room to say so . It will , she writes , be so delightful to meet again , she revelled in our last delightful talk and is longing for another . Entertain myself for some little while in composing imaginary replies to this , but candor , as usual , is obliged to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggesting that K.E.B. and I should meet in the hall for a moment before my train leaves , when she , Fanny Masoh ? whom she doubtless knows already ? and Leslie , will all be privileged to see one another . Customary preoccupation with my appearance follows , and I go in search of hotel Beauty parlor . Intelligent young operator deals with me , and says that one of her fellow-workers is also British and would be very happy to meet me . My English accent , she adds thoughtfully , is a prettier one than hers . This definitely no over-statement , as fellow-worker turns out to be from Huddersfield and talks with strong North-country accent . On return to ground-floor ? hair at least clean and wavy ? Miss Blatt materializes . She greets me as an old and dear friend and tells me that one or two perfectly lovely women of her acquaintance are just crazy to meet me , and are coming to a Tea in the hotel this very afternoon in order that they may have the pleasure of doing so . I thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am going on to Washington this afternoon . Oh , returns Miss Blatt very blithely indeed , I do n't have to give that a thought . She has taken it up with my publishers by telephone , and they quite agree with her that the contacts she has arranged for me are very , very important , and I can easily make the tenthirty train instead of the six , and reach Washington in plenty of time . All presence of mind deserts me , and I say Yes , and Very Well , to everything , and soon afterwards find myself suggesting that Miss Blatt should lunch at my table . ( Query : Why ? Answer : comes there none . ) Lunch proves definitely informative : Miss Blatt tells me about dear Beverley Nichols , who has just sent her a copy of his new book , and dear Anne Parrish , who has n't yet sent a copy of hers , but is certainly going to do so . I say Yes , and How Splendid , and wonder what Miss Blatt can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrities within miles , and no telephone . Strange idea crosses my mind that in such circumstances she would probably hardly exist as a personality at all , and might actually dissolve into nothingness . Something almost metaphysical in this train of thought , and am rather impressed by it myself , but can not , naturally , ask Miss Blatt to share in my admiration . Talk to her instead about murderstories , which I like , and instance Mrs. Belloc-Lowndes as a favorite of mine . Miss Blatt says No , murder stories make no appeal to her whatever , but Mrs. Belloc-Lowndes ? Marie ? is one of her very dearest friends . So is another Marie , ? Queen of Roumania . So , oddly enough , is Marie Tempest . On this note we part , before K.E.B. has time to think of anybody else whose name happens to be Marie . Am obliged to extract red frock from suit-case , in which I have already carefully folded it ? but perhaps not as carefully as I hoped , as it comes out distinctly creased ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea . This duly takes place , and is handsomely attended . Miss B. no doubt as well-known in Boston as in New York , London , Paris , and Hong Kong . Am gratified at seeing Caroline C. 's charming friend , and should like to talk to her , but am given no opportunity . Very large lady in black pins me into a corner , tells me to sit down , and takes her seat beside me on small sofa . She then tells me all about a local literary society , of which she is herself the foundress and the president , called The Little Thinkers . ( Can only hope that in original days when name of club was chosen , this may have been less ironical than it is now . ) President ? hope with all my heart that she has n't guessed my thoughts ? adds that they chose to call themselves Little Thinkers because it indicated modesty . They are none of them , she explains , really Deep and Profound ? not like Darwin or Huxley ( I make effort ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ? But they all like to think , and to ask themselves questions . They read , if she may say so , very deeply . And they meet and Discuss Things every Tuesday afternoon . Had I been staying here rather longer , says President , the Little Thinkers would have been only too pleased to invite me as Guest of Honor to one of their meetings , and perhaps I would have given them a short talk on the Real Meaning of Life . Should like to reply flippantly : Perhaps and Perhaps Not ? but President of the Little Thinkers evidently no good subject for wit of this description , so express instead respectful regret that time will not allow me to avail myself of the suggested privilege . Moment , it now seems to me , has definitely arrived for both the President of the L. T. 's and myself to move gracefully away from each other and each talk to somebody else . This turns out to be not easy of accomplishment , as President is between me and the rest of the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though am morally convinced that she would give quite a lot to be able to do so . We continue to look at each other and to say the same things over and over again in slightly different words , and I see Katherine Ellen Blatt eyeing me rather severely from the far end of the room , and evidently feeling ? with justice ? that I am not doing my fair share towards making a success of the party . At last become desperate , say Well , in a frantic way , and rise to my feet . President of the L. T. 's immediately leaps to hers ? looking unspeakably reIieved ? and we exchange apologetic smiles and turn our backs on one another . Catch the eye of Caroline C. 's friend , Mona , and am delighted and prepare to go and talk to her , but the President of the Little Thinkers recrudesces , and says that She wants to have me meet one of their very brightest members , Mrs. Emily Dowling Dean . Mrs. Emily Dowling Dean is a Southerner by birth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melts away and Mrs. Emily Dowling Dean and I confront each other , and she tells me that Boston is a very English town , and that she herself comes from the South and that people tell her she has never lost her Southern accent . She is ? as usual ? extremely agreeable to look at , and I reflect dejectedly that all the women in America are either quite young and lovely , or else quite old and picturesque . Ordinary female middle-age , so prevalent in European countries , apparently non-existent over here . ( Katherine Ellen Blatt an exception to this rule , but probably much older than she looks . Or perhaps much younger ? Impossible to say . ) Party draws to a close ? discover that , as usual , I have a sore throat from trying to scream as loud as everybody else is screaming ? and Fanny Mason kindly extracts me from saying goodby and takes me up to my room , ? which I shall have to leave only too soon for the station Take the opportunity of writing letters to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to print in large letters for Vicky , and this takes time , as does endeavor to be reasonably legible for Robin 's benefit . Robert 's letter comes last , and is definitely a scrawl . Am seen off at station by Fanny , Leslie , Katherine Ellen Blatt , and three unidentified men ? probably admirers of Fanny and Leslie . Retire to bed , under the usual difficulties , behind curtain ? always so reminiscent , of film-stories ? though nothing could he less like heroines there depicted than I am myself .
