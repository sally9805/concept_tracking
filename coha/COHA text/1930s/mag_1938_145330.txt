Down from the Rockies and across the flats of Utah one morning last week pounded the Flying Ute , crack fast freight of the Denver &; Rio Grande Western and a great favorite with hobos . Coming into Midvale. 10 miles south of Salt Lake City , she was two hours late by fog , snow , sleet . <P> Also late was Driver Farrold Silcox and his school bus containing 38 Mormon children on their way to the District High School . On the other side of the tracks he still had others to collect . At a grade crossing near Midvale Driver Silcox stopped , looked , listened . Then he started across the tracks . The 48-car Flying Ute , which Driver Silcox seems neither to have seen nor heard , at that instant roared out of the storm , screamed its warning and struck . A young bo named Witter , who was riding an icy tank car near the engine , jumped out in the snow to see what had happened . " It was the awfullest thing I ever saw , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody ever saw . Sixteen of the 38 children somehow got out alive . But three of them were horribly injured , one dying three days later . Driver Silcox was dead . No bus crash had ever cost so much life ; the last biggest at Salem , Ill. , March , 1937 , took 20 lives . Utah 's Public Service Commission , painfully aware of the danger that lay athwart the State 's other 2,054 unprotected grade crossings , sought jurisdiction over all the State 's school buses , planned to delegate to one older student in each bus the job of flagging his bus over railroad tracks . <P> At Luck , Wis. , day before the Midvale smash , a Soo Line train drove into a school bus at a grade crossing , killed the woman driver and three children , critically injured five others .
