was surprised to find it damp . The day was turning warm , the breeze had died , and fruit flies were beginning to be bothersome . " I think I 'll go up and lie down for a while , " he said . " The walk 's kind of taken it out of me . I really want to get a start on that story this afternoon . " " Do that , " encouraged Jane , " and I 'll call you in time for dinner . " Peggy , giving him a radiant smile , added : " 1 ' 11 say a prayer for you . " He removed his shoes and coat to stretch himself gratefully on his bed . He had grown to love this room with its gay wall paper of twining roses and cross-barred pink muslin curtains . A mammoth , python-twisting limb of one of the oak trees lifted itself just past an upper corner of the window ; the sun , shiningthrough the leaves , threw dappled shadows of gray sequins upon the floor and against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early mornings a woodpecker tapping against the mighty branch awoke him pleasantly . At this particular hour of this particular day , the ranch was humming with noises , large and small . There was a dog barkingexcitedly not far away , and the hens in Jane 's near-by chicken yard , were making a great clucking in fear of a hawk . From the crowded packing shed , there arose a steady pulsing drone as the laden boxes of prunes piled in from the orchard floors , the bourdon punctuated rhythmically with the chugchuggingof the motor truck . A distant whanging of iron on iron reached him from the machine shop , and below stairs an intermittent clapping of the kitchen screen door . . Hilda thumping an iron . . . . the sound of slopping water from the region of the horse trough where Manuel was hosing off Jack'sBuick . . the bite of a whirling saw cutting g-r-r-r-r into a log , and the cough of a gas engine .... Jane , calling a sharp admonition from the front door : " P1-ease do n't leave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll eat all the bark off that maple if you tie her there ! " . . . Jack 's good-natured answer .... hollow hooves on the hard macadam . . . . Peggy'sP201voice , melodious , eager , protesting : " I do n't want to grow up like a hothouse plant . I want to live my own life , do what Josephine did Oh , dear , why is n't it possible for me togo with you when you go to New York and find something todo there I adore New York ! " . . . . A squeaking Victrola , grinding out : " Tell all the boys on Forty-second Street That I will soon be there .... ' He fell asleep . October came in , misty and autumnal . November brought night frosts and fine days of thin sunshine and tingling air . The trees were being vigorously pruned , and burning heaps of branches , a few leaves still adhering , left trailing scarves of fragrant smoke through the tattered orchards . The days settled into a pleasant routine . Peggy bent over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a pleated lamp shade , and discussed with her sister the details of organdy dresses for them both . Jane marched efficiently about the house , superintended Manuel on top the stepladder hanging the freshly laundered curtains , oversaw the transplantingof shrubs to bank the driveway near the house , nursed Hilda , down with a quinsy throat , and " put up " five dozen jars of prune pickle . Jack , while showering , broke the early morning quiet by singing snatches from The Bohemian Girl . He ate ravenously at meal times , outlining the while a movement on foot to incorporate Carterville and make him one of its first town councilors . And Bart learned to know the sick feeling that came along with a fat envelope in the mail , learned to disguise that feeling , and to pretend with Peggy that she too did not know the meaning of those bulky missives . He learned to put their contents unread into fresh containers and send them forth once more , and learned to school himself to pick up his pen again as if he had experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned to be indifferent to the indulgent attitude of Jane and Jack . It was an air of **85;411;TOOLONG be-as-kind-as-we-can , and it set his teeth on edge and made him wish to fling his work into their faces . Peggy did not share this attitude . She was eager for him to succeed , not because she had any particular faith in his pen , but because she wanted him to he happy . He kept his stories and his hopes to himself ; he could not discuss them with anyone , not even with Peggy , hut Inure than once during those weeks of toil and discouragement , when it happened the girl was aware he had committed a fresh manuscript to the mail , she whispered and once wrote on a slip of paper : " I 'm starting a Novena . "  --  5The first encouragement came just before Christmas . Mr. Jonathan Crosby , of Crosby 's Magazine , wrote that he had read " The Hold-up at Almaden " and liked the story ; the fight between the miners and the bandits was exciting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to embrace that incident , making a short story out of it , he would be glad to consider it again . In any case , he would like to see more of Mr. Carter 's work . Bart set himself grimly to the task . At a loss to know where or how to begin he read the story aloud one evening to the family . Jack promptly fell asleep snoring gently , his chin resting on his chest ; Jane lent an attentive ear and when he had finished , had fifty suggestions to offer , none of which were either applicable or helpful ; Peggy , starry-eyed , listened and thought it was all per fectly wonderful . Bart , his teeth clenched , felt inclined to jam the whole bunch of crinkling pages into the stove . Yet in Peggy 's simple , uncritical admiration , he found help . In some curious way when he read aloud to her , a part of his mind entered her own , and he heard his words through critical ears . Listening , he could detect faults , and perceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modify . It was astonishing what an enlightening perspective came to him through this simple expedient . Ever admiring , applauding , was Peggy . Her flattery was pleasant if he cared to listen , but most of the time he did not even hear it. fP203Sitting opposite to her at the table in the dining room , whither they went in the evenings for these readings and discussions , the warm glow of the hanging center fixture lighting his head and shoulders , the manuscript before him , and illuminatingonly her weaving white hands and the round embroideringframe they held , he would say : " Of course , if I made Fernandez suspect the girl of liking Jose , he would n't trust her , would he ? " " Well , perhaps not . " " But then , that might supply Ferdy with an excellent motive for wanting to kill him . " " Yes , that 's quite right ; it would . " " An ' suppose Jose urged the girl to make up to Ferdy , would n't that strengthen the situation a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have Fernandez jealous of Jose because he 'd think the girl had grown to like hint better , and he 'd want to kill him , he 'd be so jealous , whereas all the time Juanita was thinking only of him and being true to him ! " She would repeat only what he had just said , but his mind would be already weighing other points . " Well , that will take care of that . Now , listen here , what 's wrong with this : It was the bandit 's Capistrano 's revolver . ' Sounds screwy " " I do n't see what 's wrong with it . " " Oh , yes , I do ! I 'll make it it was the revolver belonging to Capistrano , the bandit . ' Wait till I fix it . " " Now , do n't you think all that about the Bonanza shaft will have to come out ? " " Oh , no , Bart ; that description 's wonderful about how they were let down by a windlass and how dark it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water seeped in through the sides " I 'm sorry " ; he would stop her : " it will have to go ; good background perhaps , but I save three whole pages . " " But , Bart , I think it 's so interesting . I adore all that description ; it 's just wonderful . " " And I 'll have to cut this about the Indians getting mercury poisoning from the red paint they used . " " No , no , Bart , I ca n't bear to have you leave that out ! You 're ruining it ! Why , that tells how the quicksilver minesP204were discovered , and it 's all so fascinating the way the Indians cause to the Mission , and the Padres suspect it 's the mercury in the red paint that is killing them " Ca n't be helped ; out it goes . " Mr. Jonathan Crosby accepted " The Hold-up at Almaden " in its abbreviated form and sent Bart a check for seventy-five dollars . He promptly took two more short stories , rejected by half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , fifty dollars for the other . He began to write Bart friendly , encouragingletters about his work , and wanted presently to know something about the author himself . Bart sent as much as he hoped would interest him . The new year had come and gone , the frost was beginning to disappear from the ground , the plows were busy turning up the soil , and the buds on the bare whips of the trees were swollen to the bursting point . Bart had written Mr. Crosby of his eagerness to go to New York and Mr. Crosby had urged him to " come on for a talk " ; the editor would like to meet Mr. Carter and discuss his work . Bart began to debate a date for depart tire . " T think I 'll pull out next week , " he announced one evening at the supper table ; " I 've a new story nearly done , and I might as well wait and finish it tip ; then I 'd like to spend a couple of ( lays in San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever going to stop calling him that ! " Jane chided . " He 's Doctor J. Daniel ' now , and everybody addresses him so . " " I ca n't think of him as anything else , I guess . " " We 'll miss you , Bart , " Jack said , wielding a serving spoon and helping himself generously to the meat pie . " It 's been a marvelous year for me , " his brother remarked . " I feel remade ; you folks have been awfully good . " " ' S been no more than what you 'd do for one of us . " " There 's been a great deal more to it than just the milk of human kindness . ' " " When do you think you 'll come back ? " " Quielt Babe ? I hope to stay there . If Crosby will take meP205on and give me a job , I 'll stick . There 's nothing for me out here on the Coast . " " You 'll see Gill . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me down , I 'll strike Gill for a job on his trade journal . I want to stay in New York if I can . " " It 's a pretty big place . " " I know , but I 'm sure to like it . I 'll be in the center of things there . " " You 'll write and tell us all about the shops and theaters , wo n't you ? Do n't he like your uncommunicative brother Gill . " " Oh , I sha n't . Why , you and Jack have been simply wonderful to me ! I 'll never forget your kindness . " " Give us an idea what the women are wearing . " " I 'll do my best . " " And I want to hear all about Coney Island . " " Look in at the Hoffman House bar ; I hear it 's a pippin . " " Oh , and Fifth Avenue ! " " And the leg shows ! " " Jack Carter ! Behave yourself ! " The silent girl on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat , looking down at her plate , her head lowered , hands in her lap . It occurred to him his leaving would mean a good deal to her . Well , he would be sorry to say good-bye , too . She 'd been a decided help to him ; he 'd enjoyed their talks ; he 'd miss reading aloud to her . The conversation veered to other topics , and presently , supper ending , Hilda came in to clear . The men lingered over a corner of the table , smoking , but when Jack departed in the direction of his office , and Bart looked for Peggy , she was nowhere to he found . He called upstairs for her . She did not answer . Disappointed , he sought his room and worked for a couple of hours copying on his typewriter . Towards ten o'clock , ' he came down to the veranda to fill his lungs with deep breaths of night air and discovered Peggy at her embroidery beside the stove in the sitting room . " I looked for you after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the square back of the couch on which she was seated ; " I wanted to say I 'm sorry I 'm going East withoutP2o6 you , but as soon as I 'm there and located , I 'll do what I can to find a job for you . " I 've been thinking about that , " he continued , " and I do n't know how you 'd get along . You 'd have to live with somebody ; maybe Gill 's wife would put you up . You know , they do n't pay girls much in New York ; I read not long ago , that salesgirlsat Siegel , Cooper 's get only six dollars a week . It 's expensiveto live in New York . " I1is words dwindled to silence , and he scowled at the red light flickering through the blackened isinglass in the stove door . The embroidery hoop sank to the girl 's lap , and for a time neither spoke . Bart was about to break the silence with somethingencouraging when he saw a large crystal tear fall from Peggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a hand upon the folded ones which lay upon the needlework . " Peg , dear , " he said in distress , " I 'm terribly sorry . This means a lot to me too . I do n't know how I ever should have made a start without your faith in me . Believe me , I mean that , Peg . You 've been a trump . And I swear to you , Peggy  --  I swear it  --  I ' 11 look round just as soon as I reach New York , see how the land lies , and find you a job . I 'll tackle Gill ; I 'll talk to him . Crosby must employ lots of girls . All periodicals have subscriptiondepartments , and there 's always room for one more girl . I 'll do nnv level best . In six months , by next fall at any rate , I 'll be writing to you to conic on , and I 'll be meeting you at the ( ; rand Central Station to give you a gorgeous welcome .. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin quivereda little , and Bart saw  --  saw straight into her soul . For a moment , the revelation took his breath away , and then instinctively , in sympathy , he put his arms about her , and , like Pudgie years before , she came unhesitatingly into his embrace . The touch of her electrified him . He had a second 's glimpse of her wide , round , glistening brown eyes , her half-parted lips close to his , before he pressed his mouth to hers . It was a long kiss , while her soft young breast rose against his own , and the blood beat up into his temples . Then he put her from him , burying his face in his hands , pressing his eyeballs in pain , while an avalanche of emotions poured through him . Thoughts  --  memories -- pricks of conscience  --  love  --  hunger  --  passion !  | " Merciful Christ , " he breathed through his shut hands . He stood up after a time facing her , abject words of repentanceon his lips , but the brown eyes lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They held only love , radiant love , trusting , hopeful , and ardent . I le fell on his knees before her , drinking deep of her look , words pressing against his lips . The struggle to speak passed after a while ; he was content to feast his eyes , filling his soul with the glory of what he saw , holding her soft hands in his , while his own tears sprang to blind him , and he realized the miracle . of love had come to him , and that in this girl-child he had found the woman of all women , that here , giving him kick look for look , believing in him confidently , was the companion of his destiny . Days of doubt , ( lays of perplexity and groping , nights debating , probing , weighing consequences , hours of fervent prayer , when he knelt beside her in the little church at Carterville , baring his soul to his Maker , imploring the Virgin 's intercession , begging hard for guidance and for worthiness . Walking home with her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tumbling chatter in his ears , her happy , radiant smile and her dark eyes shining in his face , her dancing , eager step failing utterly to keep pace with his own , he could not believe he was doing wrong in marrying her , he dared not even contemplate what it would mean to silence that joyous laughter , to still that high-beating heart , by telling her she could not share with him his hopes and plans . For he knew he had come to love Peggy , to love her with a fervency only comparable to her own . The thought of her  --  her sweetness , youth , purity , her utter delectableness  --  belongingsomeday to him would bring his heart knocking into his throat . Ile learned the depth and height of humility Unworthy , unworthy , unworthy , he kept repeating to himself . He went to jack the second day after the night of revelationand told him what had occurred . " I do n't know what to do , " he said ; " I want to do what 's right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this thing , if it 's fair to Peggy . In the past forty-eight hours something terrificp2o8 has happened to me . Just finding out she cared for me has made me know for the first time what true love really is . I have n't a savory past . I 've been singed and burnt and disillusioned . I 've been married once , I 've had a mistress . It 's a record no one could feel proud of . But it 's past  --  over and done with . I 'm a different man to-day . I 'm nearly thirty , and I ought to know my own mind by this time . I 'm sure I love Peggy better than I 'll love any other woman as long as I live ; certainly I love her better than any other woman I 've ever known . " I must do one of two things : get out and never see her again , or try to forget the past and make her the best husband I can .... " I tell you , Jack  --  " Bart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't think I could do the first . " His brother 's hand was upon his shoulder . " I do n't know how Jane will feel , " Jack said gravely , " but I know I 'd be damned well pleased . " Bart gripped him . For a few moments he was unable to speak . When he found his voice , he said huskily : " I thought I 'd slip up to San Francisco to-morrow and have a talk with Father Francis and the doctor . They 're the ones who 'd know what 's best for me to do , and if either of them thinks I ought n't to marry Peg , I 'll beat it to New York , and it will be up to you to stand by and break the news . "  |p209AT  AN early hour of a glorious morning the last of April , Bart and Peggy were being married at the Cathedral in San Francisco by Father Francis Carter . Bart lifted his eyes to the great altar before him , adorned with gleaming candles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a dark blue tailor suit and a blue spring hat , knelt beside him , and upon the raised steps of the altar which rose so white and glorious before him , his brother , clad in cassock , surplice , and stole , moved and made obeisance , now no longer the man Bart knew and loved so well , but wholly the ecclesiastic , priest of the Church , representing Almighty God . Sanctityand high resolve flooded Bart 's soul . At that hour , except for the handful of relatives in the front pews , an attendant or two , and a few early worshipers scattered here and there , the great edifice was deserted . Toward the back of the church , near the entrances could be faintly heard , now and then , the squeak of tiptoeing feet ; above the great organ the rose window was gloriously illuminated by the rising sun ; an early morning freshness mingled with the smell of stale incense , flowers , and flickering wax candles pervadedthe place . The front pews were occupied by a dozen persons : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and behind these , Doctor Dan and Louise . Trudie , with her husband and two small boys , sat on the other side of the aisle . I'orter Farnsworth and Aunt Gertrude with their daughters , Ada and Dora , now grown women over twenty , occupied the pew directly in the rear . They were all looking at him , thought Bart , studying his back as he knelt , wondering no doubt what kind of a man he really was , and whether or not he would make Peggy a good husband . He lifted his eyes to the white tabernacle before him ,  | and prayed earnestly he might prove worthy of the purity , goodness , and sweetness of the girl who was promising to be his wife . It was over before he realized it . The group in the front pews swarmed out to meet them as he led Peggy from the altar , crowding around , kissing , shaking hands , beaming good wishes . The voices rose in a babble ; the empty church echoed . " Darling ! " " Fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best of luck . " " Careful , Dan , you 're mashing her bouquet ! " " My dears .... kiss your old Tilly .... " " Doubly your sister now , Bart . " " This is my husband , Bart ; you 've never met him . And my two boys Leo , take your finger out of your mouth ! " A young man with a strong , thin Irish face , in whom Bart identified Jerome McGillicuddy , gave him a warm handclasp , and two pairs of brown eyes , in the round , brown faces of his twin sons , stared up at him . " Bart ! Father Francis is waiting for you in the sacristy . . . . " " Ilello , Aunt Gertrude , how nice .... " " It was pretty early to get up , but I had to come . . . . And here 's Ada and Dora .... " " Gracious , they 've grown up ! Peggy , would you know them ? Why , it 's ten years . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my boy , glad to see you getting so fine a girl . " " Thanks awfully ; I 'm glad to see myself getting her . Where'sFelix ? Could n't he come ? " The smile on the man 's face faded . " Felix has n't been very well . He 's getting better , though ; just at present he 's down in a sanitarium at Belmont . " " Too bad ; I 'm sorry . Give him my best . . . . " " You must hurry , my boy ; you 've got a train to catch .... " Jack dragged Bart away . The little room in which FatherFrancis was waiting seemed jammed with people , too . Bartseized the priest 's hand in both of his , squeezed it , and in asteady gaze looked the affection , gratitude , and devotion he felt . P211Father Francis patted him on the shoulder , smiling with understanding . Someone handed Bart a pen ; he signed ; Peggy did likewise . " Come on , everybody ; breakfast at the Palace ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's almost eight o'clock now ; the Overland leaves at nine . " Jane 's brisk managerial voice . Six of the guests crowded into Doctor Dan 's automobile and sped to the downtown hotel . " You have the trunk checks , Jack ? " " Yes . Your tickets , everything is right here in this envelope . I 'll give it to you just before you get on the train . " " And the suitcases ? " " Do n't worry . They 're all right , checked at the Ferry . ' Memberwhen you drove Jane and inc over to Guadalupe and saw us off on the Gilroy stage ? " " Do I ! " " How do you feel , darling ? " " Me ? Oh , simply glorious . I 'm too excited to talk . " " How 's the time ? " " Goodness sakes alive , Bart , you 're making me as nervous as a witch ! I talked to the head waiter at the Palace myself yesterday , and he promised he 'd have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight o'clock . Do you suppose the Farnsworths were hurt at not being asked ? I never thought --  " " Say , what 's the matter with Felix ? " " T. B. He 's got it bad . " " Same as Charley , hey ? " " Yep . Wo n't last six months . All those Farnsworth children have rotten constitutions . Dora 's next on the list . " " Must have been a tubercular streak on Porter 's side . I heard his mother ( lied of it . " " But what ( lo you know about Tilly ? Has n't she blossomed out ! " Everyone commented on Tilly 's looks . Bart had talked with his sister on several occasions ( luring the recent months , and while he had noted she seemed far less giggly , nervous , and kittenish , and very much more attractive , to-day was the first time he had seen her smartly groomed in town attire . In her gray dress , her gray cape , and gray plumed hat , she madeP212a figure that drew not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still remarking upon the change in her as they reached the hotel . " You know the reason , " Dan said to Bart , as they followed the others inside ; " she 's going to have a baby . " " Really ? Tilly ? " " Yep . Pregnancy does a lot for nervously high-strung women of Tilly 's type . " " She 's certainly improved . " " I reckon you and Peggy will be having your own troubles this time next year . " " Oh , no , " Bart said with a definite head shake ; " Peg and I have a large problem on our hands . New York 's no easy place to live in , and I want to get a real start in my work first . No kids for a while , if it 's all the same to you . " He grinned , and Dan made an expressive gesture with his hands . The others , who had come down in various conveyances , joined them at this moment , and Bart was struck afresh with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a maternal dignity and reminded him strongly of their mother . The wedding party had the big Court dining room to themselves , but the emptiness of the place was subduing . After the grapefruit , everyone began buttering rolls , though Bart had no desire to cat ; his mind was upon the passing time , and he was still conscious of the emotion he had experienced during the j earlier hour at the Cathedral . " It 's a pity we have to hurry this way , " Jane said in an annoyed tone . It was a pity , Bart thought . Such an elaborate breakfast , and so many people to serve in so short a space of time , struck him as a foolish undertaking . It was obvious it was going to be impossible to take care of all their needs in thirty minutes , and he was determined to be on his way by the half hour . " There 's plenty of time , " Jane assured everybody ; " Jack , sec if you can hurry them up . " " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bart caught Peggy 's concerned glance and realized he was frowning . His face broke sunny at once , and he touched her hand . How he loved this new wife of his ! Everyone was talking . Trudie had captured cereal for thep213twins , and as she was sugaring and creaming it for them , an argument was in progress between herself and her husband regardingsome matter of discipline . Louise was discussing houses with Tilly who was in the throes of building her own ; Josephine , beautiful of skin and hair , looking intellectual behind her rimless pince-nez , was urging special advice upon the bride , who sat next to her ; Jack , across the table , explained to Dan why it had been impossible for Father Francis to join them , and Jane waved and tried to catch the head waiter 's attention . Bart nervously consulted his watch . It was twenty minutes to nine , and only half of the meal had appeared . So far , there had been no coffee for anyone . Bart declined to delay longer , and Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The others night stay and have breakfast at their leisure ; I ) ; ui would settle for it later with Jack , who was to go along with Jane and see the bride and groom safely aboard their train . There were more hand-shakings , good-byes and " good lucks "  --  scraping of chairs , waiters looking on , hats , coats  --  Peggy 's bridal bouquet to be rescued  --  a final scurry , and six minutes before the boat left , four of them were flying down Market Street in a taxicab , Bart and Jack alternately craning a neck to see the ferry clock . They made it . The two men ran for the hand luggage while Jane bought tickets for herself and Jack . There was a fluttering of other tickets , green ones , at the gate , which the guard examinedand punched with infuriating leisureliness , and finally , out of breath but drawing deep ones of relief , burdened with bags and coats , the four sank gratefully upon the first vacant seats aboard the boat . Presently they sought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with thick mugs of fragrant hot coffee , and after that everyone felt better . But there was nothing for them to say to one another ; the sisters linked arms and sat close together ; Jack offered Bart a cigarette , and Bart offered one to Jack . Every phase of the adventure had been discussed and rediscussedby them all . Bart had two hundred dollars in crackling greenbacks safely stowed in a wallet within the breast pocket of his coat . It would be enough for a while , and after that , if he did n't land a job , well . . . . Peggy could come back to Los Robles , and he 'd rough it alone . All had agreed to this , butp214Peggy and Bart were sure nothing like it would happen . They were wholly confident ; New York was a city to he conquered that was all  --  and conquer it they would . " Oh , we 'll get a cute little apartment somewhere  --  maybe a couple of rooms  --  and I 'll cook I ) " ' That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carter : your wife can cook !

I never can understand why theseboats do n't smash the piers to pieces Give me thattypewriter , Jane ; Jack , you take the hat box .... " A few minutes later , the Pullman porter was relieving them of their luggage beside the steps of their car . " Oh , Janey ! A drawing room ! .... Jack ! How wonderful of you ! " " Say , old man , this is white --  " " Jane 's idea --  " " My dear , it was just a little good-bye present --  " " As if you had n't done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers ! I wonder who ....

And , oh , Janey , look at the little lights we have to read by  --  and an electric fan all our own ! It 's palatial ! . . . . Oh , Bart , Bart , I 'm so happy , I think I 'll just die ! " and Peggy flung her arms about her husband and kissed him on his cheeks , his nose , his lips . " Darling .... " he protested , but her sweetness , her youth , her childish excitement , and her utter adorableness made his heart strain toward her . " Now , listen here , my boy . Cut out that love-making for just a minute . Here are your checks , your trunk checks ; there was sixteen dollars and something excess baggage , but I paid it , so your trunks are all clear . Do n't let ' em collect for ' em at that end , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckon the conductor will come along and pick ' em up as soon as you get started . But now , for heaven 's sake , do n't lose ' em . " P215Jane was sitting close to Peggy , her arm about her waist ; there were tears in her eyes , and she was saying in a shaking whisper : " Little sister .... " " Now , if you get kind of worried when you get down to the last bill or two , all you got to do is to wire --  " " I sha' n't have to touch you --  " " Well , if you should . " " I wo n't . " " And give that rascally twist brother of mine a good calldownfor not writing " " He 'll meet us at the Grand Central ; at least , I hope he will . I wired him . " " All . . . .

" " Good .... " On the gigantic Solano , the train had crossed Carquinez Strait and was speeding over the tule lands toward Sacramento . Peggy had put her blue hat in a paper bag , her blue jacket and her rough tweed coat with the fur collar on hangers , her bridal bouquet in the metal basin of the wash room , her orchids in the drinking tumbler , had arranged books , magazines , and candy , and now sat at the window , her elbow on its ledge , following the scenery with her eyes , commenting in an endless stream on everything she saw . Bart experimented with the luggage , stowing it in different places , trying various arrange- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at length , he seated himself opposite to his wife and let his eyes rest contentedlyupon her . She was beautiful , he thought , and had borne herself with dignity and self-possession during the wedding , the trying breakfast at the Palace , and the ordeal of saying good-bye . Of the two sisters , it had been Peggy who had been resolute , sure of herself , confident of the future . Hers was an indomitable nature ; she was afraid of nothing ; her faith was measureless . So young , so tender , so guileless , so sweet and good . He put out his hand and touched her knee , and , as she turned , her eyes grew large and dark and soft . Taking the seat beside her , his fingers interlocked with hers ; she nestled against him , her head upon his shoulder , and the girlish chitter-chatter was hushed . Together they looked out at the flying panorama , conscious of little they saw , thinking and feeling each other 's nearness and dearness . " It 's the great adventure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She made no reply . " The great adventure , " he repeated . She nestled closer , squeezing his hand . The train thundered across culverts , screamed at crossings , and fled onward over the marshes . " You 're not afraid ? " Bart asked . He had to wait for her answer . " Why should I be ? " Her soft childish voice never failed to stir him . " 1 have you , " she finished simply. " 1 may he a failure , " he said . She shook her head , " You wo n't . I know it . " " I may not be able to land a job . " " You will . " " Perhaps my salary wo n't be large enough for us to live on . " " It will have to be . " " We may not find an apartment we can afford . " " We 're bound to . " " And I may never write a line that will electrify the world ! " " I 'm certain you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her spirit and hugged her arm . " You muggins ! " he said fondly . She straightened herself , turning to face him , her large eyes studying him soberly .   " Bart , " she began , a faint frown marking her brow . " My darling ? " " I want you to tell me something ? " " Anything , sweetheart . " " Honest and truly ? " " Honest and truly . " " Cross your heart ? " " Cross my heart . " She regarded him firmly before putting her question , her expression serious , her mouth pinched together . " Do you love me ? " At his " Ah-h " of assurance , she flung herself upon him , her arms about his neck , her face buried against his breast . He caught her , raising her head , and kissed her . " My husband , " she said softly . She drew back to study him again , holding him front her as her eyes traveled over his face . " My own  --  my very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , kissing her tenderly . " You know , " she said , freeing herself once more , " you know , sometimes I wake up in the night and I think it 's all a dream  --  your coming to care for me ; I think I 've imagined it all . Bart , I 've loved you ever since that night I drove you home from Guadalupe and you told me all the grand things you 'd done in the city , and all the wonderful things you intended to do , and I believed every word of it , and now I believe you 're going to be even more wonderful than you ever thought you 'd be ! But sometimes it does n't seem possible you can care the snap of your fingers about me . I ca n't believe it 's I  --  that 's all  --  that it 's Peggy Carter , Jo 's and Jane 's little baby sister , whom you 've chosen to make your wife , for we are married now , are n't we , Bart ? We 're married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're my own , my very , very own , and nothing in the world will ever make you anything less , because you may learn to hate and despise me , Bart , but you 'll always be my husband , and I 'll never let you go even if you beat me or rob a bank ! " He stopped her flood with his lips , and as he held her close , his arms about her , he repeated to himself what she had just said : that she was his , she belonged to him , and he would live his life in serving her , protecting her , and loving her , and that nothing in the world should ever take her from him . Fresh , rosy and sweet she was , like some fragrant bloom , soft , luscious , and round like ripe fruit  --  and she was his wife . " God punish me , " he prayed , his eyes closed , his cheek against her hair , " if I ever hurt this child , if I ever prove unworthyof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the approaching night , eagerness and love , respect for her innocence contending in his thoughts . Of how much she knew , what she expected or did not expect , he had no notion . He watched for a look in her eyes  --  self-consciousness , fear of him , fear of the unknown . She betrayed nothing . All through the long afternoon , as the train climbed and climbed into the mountains , she was gay and garrulous . She exulted over fleeting glimpses of sheer canyons and craggy peaks through breaks in the snow sheds , and cried aloud and clapped her hands when she caught sight of a patch of actual snow high up on a crest . The luxury and conveniences on the train drew happy exclamations from her at each fresh discovery . Everything was wonderful ; everything delighted her ; she was carried from one excitement to another . Not once did he detect nervous anticipation or find her looking at him with questioning , doubtful eyes . Even when it came time to make ready for dinner in the dining car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns in the tiny lavatory , did she appear in any way perturbed . Bart was puzzled . He had looked for a time of gravity , of trepidation as the afternoon wore on to reassure her and settle her fears . He had thought to make no marital advances toward her until they reached New York ; in any case , to be content to let circumstances decide the matter . He was eager to possess her , but he would not permit his mind to dwell upon that ecstasy . He loved her too much to think about her in that way , and yet he appreciated that this girl who warmly returned his love and wanted him for a husband would not wish him not to desire her . He was aware , too , that this budding rose , whom he had married , was a passionate little person . She had quivered and trembled in hisp219arms , clung with her lips hungrily to his , turned hot and cold , straining him to her on many an occasion during their engagementdays . Perhaps she did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more reason , he reminded himself now , why she should be treated with the utmost consideration . Child of love and simple faith ! I le idolized her ! They dined hilariously in the dining car , consulting each other about what to eat , making mental notes of the prices . " I think I 'll just have some tea and toast and tomato salad , " Peggy announced . " You 'll have nothing of the kind . You 'll have a broiler and some green peas and a dessert . You can have the tea and toast too , if you like . " " Oh , I could n't , sweetheart ; I just simply could n't . I 'm not in the least hungry . " " You may be later on . " Leaning across their table and whisperingearnestly : " Darling , I 've got plenty of money ; you must n't let what things cost influence you . That 's what this is for , " and he tapped his breast pocket . " Could n't we divide a dish ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive head . They debated so long over what to have , he began to feel uncomfortably about the waiter . " You look so adorable in that blue hat , " he told her , when at last their order was in hand . " Do I ? " Her eyes grew warm , and with the tip of a finger on her lips she sent him a kiss . " I suppose we 're like all the newlyweds that ever were , " she said . " Do you suppose anybody suspects us ? I do n't believe anybody would take us for bride and groom , and I do n't care if they did . I only hope most brides are as happy as I am , because I 'm simply radiantly happy ! " " You 're wonderful , " he said , drinking of her eyes . " I adore you , " she whispered back . He thought nervously about the night . They played Poker Patience in their drawing room until after nine , and then Peggy 's yawns brought the fact home to220 SEED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that morning , and it had been a long , fatiguing day . " Well , my clear , how about calling it a bet and turning in ? " he asked casually. " line . " Her mouth opened in a dislocating gape , and she gathered up the cards . " Will you ring ? " " King ? " " Yes , for the porter . Press that little button there just under the mirror . I 'll go forward to the smoking car for a puff , and you can step out and sit in one of the unmade-up sections , or go back to the observation car , until he 's finished I'llgive you plenty of time to get to bed , " he enunciated carefully . The porter knocked and peered in upon them . " Will you make us up , when you have time ? " Bart said to him , edging himself to his feet from between the seat and the table . " Yas , sir ; youse next How you like ' em ? " The darkeycocked his head as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em ? " Bart repeated , puzzled . " Yas , sir . You just want the lower , or top and bottom ? " It took Bart a moment to understand his meaning ; then the blood surged to his temples . This situation he had not foreseen . His mouth opened and shut , a meaningless sound escaped him , and then in a rush , he blurted out : " Top and bottom , I guess , " and fled to the club car . It was more than an hour before he could bring himself to the point of returning . He considered taking a highball to bolster his nerve , but he feared the odor of whisky on his breath might trouble Peggy , or at least make her wonder the reason for it . " Come on , now , do n't be a fool , " he said , getting to his feet and starting in the direction of his car . " You 're behaving like a schoolboy , not like a man who 's been married before and knows something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that , a regular rake , and it behooves you to remember it and try to act like one . "  |p221Yet  he hesitated again just outside the door of their room , a finger poised a moment above the push button that sounded the announcer . Peggy was in the lower berth . I Te caught a glimpse of her soft brown , braided hair , her wide-open dark eyes , the pink and lace of her night dress over her white neck , her lovely hands and arms lying upon the coarse Pullman sheet . His glance immediately roved about the cluttered and crowded little room , pretending a survey , while he divested himself of his coat and waistcoat , to hang them carefully upon a wire hanger . In the seclusion of the lavatory , he finished his disrobing and donned his new pajamas . Behind its protecting door , alone with himself , he studied his reflection in the mirror , rubbed his chin , nervously removed the orchids from the glass tumbler to fill it and wet his lips with ice water , brushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep breath , stepped out into view . " Well , my dear , let 's pop this out , " he said , carefully avoidingPeggy 's eyes , and switching out the ceiling lights . Ile inspectedthe electric fan . " Do n't think we 'll need this . " He turned it on ; experimented with it ; turned it off . Next he manipulated the lever that controlled the heat , working it back and forth , and closed it . " Well , " he said . Lamps in the corners of the upper berth still were lit , and one just above Peggy 's head in the lower one , illuminated her lovely childish face . He rested his hand upon the shelf of the upper berth , prepared to mount ; he caught her eye and smiled . " Good-night , darling . " Sinking to the side of her bed , he leaned forward to kiss her . She raised her lips to his ; they trembled against his own . He drew away , swallowing , one hand upon his throat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie said huskily , and bent over for another kiss . Her arms went around his neck , she drew down his head , meeting his lips . IIe caught her to him then , and passion flared , up in white flame , love and longing drawing them together.  |p222NEW  YORK m welcoming guise , New York in smiling mood , New York in gayest dress . Gill met them at the station , a man of thirty-five , lanternjawed , hollow-cheeked , beetle-browed , nervous , brusque , thoroughlymetropolitan . He awed Bart by his speech and assertive manner . " Well-well-well , Mr. Man , here you are . Hello , Peggy ; my , but you 've grown pretty ! How 's everybody back home ? We 'll have to get together and have a long pow-wow . " He was not unfriendly ; he was troubled and in a hurry . Guiding the two through the crowd , he led them to a spot a little apart , where they could talk . " Now , listen here : I 'm in a fix . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sloane 's yesterday , but there 's nothing doing yet . Maybe any minute . I wanted to look after you when you got here , but you see how it is . Must dash right back to the hospital , but I 'll try to see you to-night or to-morrow . Now , tell me , " he turned to Bart , his brows knitting , " you wrote you expected to live here ? ' Zat right ? Got a job ? " " No , not yet . " " Well , gee whiskers . What 're you going to do ? " " Write ; work on a newspaper or magazine . I want to be a reporter . " Bart saw he would receive no encouragement here ; Gill must not be thinking he expected it . The sharp eyes bored into him . " How you going about it ? " " Oh , I have plenty of contacts . " The other rubbed his chin , frowning . " All the magazines have been accepting my stuff , " Bart continued . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Century , Harper 's , some of the others . The Times ran all my fire-and/earthquake articles  --  front-paged ' em , you know . They wrote me to come on and have a talk with them . " " Oh . " Gill was impressed , relieved . His face brightened . " That 's fine ; that 's bully , " he said . " Now , listen here , Mr. Man : I ca n't pilot you folks about the way I 'd like , but I 've engaged a room for you over at the Park Avenue Hotel . Did n't know how you were fixed , of course , so I reserved you somethingfairly reasonable . Cost you about six dollars a day . The Park Avenue is an old-fashioned dump , but it 's good , has class . You 'll like it there , I 'm sure . I lave your trunks sent over , and I 'll look you up as soon as I can . This baby  --  my , it 's all happened at the wrong time has complicated everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give your checks to the hotel porter . He 'll get your baggage for you ; least trouble to yourselves . You 'll find a taxi right outside the station . 1 ' 11 call you up later in the day . ' S long , and do n't let ' cm sell you any gold bricks . " With a wave of his hand , he hurried away in the crowd . Bart looked at Peggy and Peggy looked in return . Bart made a grimace . " We wo n't concern ourselves too much about Mr. Henry Aloysius Carter . However , we 'll take his tip and try his hotel , and then perhaps to-day or to-morrow we 'll find a cheaper place of our own . " He signaled to the porter waiting patiently beside their luggage . " Taxi , please . " The Park Avenue , a rambling barracks of a hotel with a large glass-roofed court , reminded them of the Palace in San Francisco . It seemed friendly and homelike . " Just think , Peg , we were having breakfast at the Palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Herald spread out upon the bed and was studying the theatrical advertisements . " Goodness , " Peggy said , her nose against the window pane . " It seems just too wonderful to be here in my dear old , darling New York , because while I always vowed I 'd get here , I never thought I actually would because --  "  | " Say , Bart , what 's that funny-looking building over there that looks like a fort ? " They ventured to the streets , trying to look inconspicuous , hesitating to ask questions . They discovered Fifth Avenue , Broadway , the Metropolitan Opera House , and Times Square . " Gee , " thought Bart , gazing up , awed and marveling at the tall , triangular-shaped building that gave its name to the intersection , " that 's the paper that ran my fire-and-earthquake articles ! " That Saturday and Sunday , they roamed the city , traveled on bus tops , visited Central Park , penetrated the portals of the renowned Waldorf-Astoria , sat for a few thrilling minutes in far-famed Peacock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , occupied gallery seats for The Midnight Sons , said to one another over and over that there never in the world was such a show , attended " High " at St. Patrick 's on Sunday , trod the pavements of Fifth Avenue with beating hearts , and drank deep of the air of Broadway as if it were elixir upon a mountain top . There began to prey on Bart 's mind a growing fear that New York was too big for them , too colossal , too terrific ; it took influence to break in here . It was n't like ' Frisco . Poignantly there came back to him his first days with Pudgie in that city : dishwashing at the Athens ' Grill on Third Street ! IIe realized more and more lie had relied too much on Jonathan Crosby 's slight show of interest . Peggy , buoyant , chirping , delighted with everything , believingfirmly in the future , reproached him for his gloom . He dared not confide to her his fears ; she would only have poohpoohedthem . He loved her too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when her head with its soft fragrant braids lay upon his shoulder , a hand curled like a leaf upon his chest , his arm beneath and about her waist  --  they always slept so  --  he would stare up into the darkness , thinking , planning , praying , telling himself through wakeful hours that somehow he must crash through , somehow land a job , somehow gain a foothold . For the first day and a half , his thoughts of Gill were full of resentment . He and Peggy had not been in when he telephoned , but when Gill , in person , captured them on Sunday after their return from church , Bart was forced to admit hep225was not much changed from the old Gill he remembered as a boy riding herd at Los Robles , or from the eager , ambitious , talkative undergraduate at Berkeley . Gill was a proud father .. line , healthy ten-pound girl had arrived late Saturday afternoon , and Alice was now all right , but she had had a terrible time ; a great specialist had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had showed such pluck . They were going to call the baby " Sylvia . " ... . Gill gave a rapid-fire account of himself . The Shoe AEgis was a periodical devoted to shoe manufacturers ; it was one of several trade journals published by Jeffry B. Dawson , and Alice was old man Dawson 's only daughter -- a perfectly beautiful girl , high-spirited like a race horse , brilliant , talented , who had been a star at Vassar . The Dawson Publishing Company was a big organization , but for the past five or six years , it had been having a hard time . Dawson was an old curmudgeon , with a lot of antiquated ideas about business . He was gradually lettinggo , and Gill had confidence in the future ; they had been cutting down expenses  --  really , it had been the overhead which had eaten up all the profits  --  and Gill was mighty glad to hear that Bart had such good connections , because he had been afraid that his brother might have been expecting him to find him a position with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there'd 've been " nothing doing . " The whole trade journal business was in a bad way ; too much competition . Alice should be allowed to go home in a couple of weeks , and as soon as she was strong enough , Gill wanted Bart and Peggy to come down to Port Washington for a visit  --  a weekend , maybe . In spite of his incisive , challenging manner , there was somethingmagnetic about Gill . Bart discussed him with his wife after he had gone . " He 's a good guy , " he summarized , " and he 's bound to land on his feet , but , by jiminy , I 'm not going to look to him for any handouts ( luring my present low ebb ! " " What do you mean by my present low ebb ' ? " Peggy demanded . " Why , Bart Carter , you make me positively ill by the way you gloom ! You 'd think you 'd lost a leg or something . Heavenly day ! We only arrived Friday , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crosby to-day or yesterday ! "  | " Do n't be mad at me , " Bart pleaded , drawing her to him to be kissed . " I ought to be , because you 're a bad boy , and because you ought to feel in your bones that Mr. Crosby 's going to give you a job , or the Times take you on , because the way to get a job is to believe beforehand you 're going to get it , because faith removes mountains ' . . . . " But her confidence did not dispel his worry . As they passed lines of brownstone fronts , he would stare up at their facades , wondering if somewhere under a roof there was a vacant room or two . What were rents in New York ? Would it be easier and cheaper for them to find a boarding house ? In any case , they must move . Gill had suggested Washington Square as a locality in which they might find suitable accommodation , so Bart and Peggy spent Sunday afternoon investigating that neighborhood . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bart became more discouraged and began to find his wife 's persistentoptimism somewhat irritating . On their way back to the hotel , they sought out the address of Crosby 's Magazine on Fifth Avenue . Large gold fat letters , high up on the sixth story of a plain granite building , whose ground floor was occupied by a famous haberdasher , identified its offices . Bart stood on the opposite side of the street , gazing up at blank windows , and his spirits sank lower still . Sunday afternoon in the business section of the Avenue , the great thoroughfare was comparatively deserted . An occasional pedestrianor couple in Sunday finery hurried past , a limousine rolled by , half-filled busses careened and lumbered on their courses , an empty hansom briskly clop-clopped toward them , its cabby invitingly flourishing a whip ; window boxes of hotels and clubs bloomed with gay tulips , an early florid awning or two gave warning of approaching hot weather . The silent vacant office buildings stared blankly at one another with shuttered windows and padlocked grilled doorways . The street was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick breath . " Come on , let 's go to the hotel and have a cocktail . May cheer us up . If Crosby does n't take me on , guess we 'd better hit the trail back to Los Robles . " P227That evening Peggy put on her prettiest dinner frock , and Bart struggled into his unfamiliar tuxedo . At the same table , where an hour or two before they had had their drinks , they dined luxuriously , and much too extravagantly , for , by what seemed to them a silly ruling of the hotel , the dollar-and-a-half table d'hote could not be served in the court . Bart declined to move to the hot , smoky inside rooms , where it might be had , and  --  the apologetic head waiter standing by  --  shook his head crossly at his wife when she begged him to change . It was their first tiff , soon over , and the joy of reconciliation made the trivial disagreement almost worth while , so Bart said afterwards . The cost of the meal ran close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than twice what they had planned to spend , but the lights and orchestra , the gay , noisy , happy throng about them , the feeling it was spring and that they were together in their beloved New York , justified the extra money they decided , many times over . " Is n't it marvelous ? " Bart asked , his elbows on the table . " Marvelous , " she returned , her look intent on his , dark brown eyes glowing . " Do you love me ? " " Ah-h , you know I do . " " I worship you . " " You should only worship God . " " Then you and God . " " That 's sacrilegious . " " Ca n't help it . I worship you . " " Silly .... " " Oh , well , you do n't know .... " " I do too . " " What ? " " How it feels to worship somebody . " " You mean me ? " " No , the soda-water boy at Fuller 's Candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . " The orchestra departed , the great court restaurant emptied . in the bumping , slowly ascending elevator which carried them up to their bedroom floor as they were pushed back into a cornerby other passengers , their hands found one another 's , fingers linking . Jonathan Crosby was a charming , pleasant-mannered gentleman with silky white hair , a silky white mustache , a ruddy , youthful face with a quaint dimple in either cheek , and shrewd , blue restless eyes . To Bart , he was agreeably cordial . " Sit down , Mr. Carter . We 've corresponded a bit ; that quicksilver-mine story of yours was quite a corker . You 're here from California ? In just what part of California is Carterville ? I think you wrote me it took its name from your parents . How 'd that happen ? " Bart was nervous . He wet his lips and tried to talk but  --  as he described the interview later to Peggy  --  he " could n't get going . " The room was lined to the ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , piled high with manuscripts , correspondence , papers . Idly twisting a letter opener in his hands , his restless gaze shifted from quick glances at his caller 's face to the gray windows which gave upon a colorless sky and the roofs of tall office buildings . The noise of traffic below , absent yesterday , now rose in a roar , while just outside of Crosby 's office there was a hum of activity . Bart could hear rapid feet sounding in the hall , men 's voices , the incessant summonsof telephone bells , the click of typewriters , the slamming of doors . He felt hurried , his opportunity slipping , Crosby 's attention waning . " I 've got to get a job , " he suddenly blurted out . " I 've come all the way from California , Mr. Crosby , to ask you to give me one . " The dam which had held back all he wanted to say burst at last , a gush of words poured from him , and he talked without pausing for several minutes , ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I was married last Tuesday  --  I 've less than a hundred dollars in the world and "  --  repeating himself  --  " I'vegot to have a job . " Crosby shot him one of his furtive glances , the waving letteropener was stilled for a moment . " What kind of a job ? "  | " Any kind of a job , I do n't care ; writing ads , copy , tying up magazines , addressing , filing , running errands  --  anything you can give me to do . " The notion of asking for a part-time position in order to write at home evaporated as if he had never entertained it . What he wanted now was employment , employment which would pay for his and Peggy 's food and pay their rent , employmentwhich would let them live in New York , justify her faith in him , permit him to go hack to tell her  --  shout to her : " I 've got a job  --  I 've got a job ! " Suddenly he was fighting , fighting with Crosby 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint . The editor listened . The pleasant smile disappeared . 1 lis eyes went to Bart , went to the window , went hack to Bart . He pursed his lips , tapped them with the tip of the letter opener , and at every silence Bart renewed his arguments . All the time , he was thinking of Peggy , of running back to her , up the stairs , no time to wait for the bumping elevator , bursting into their hotel room , crying : " I 've got a job  --  I 've got a job ! " At last he realized he had said all that was needed . He shut his lips and waited for Crosby to speak . The man 's eyes continued to flicker  --  at him , at the window , the metal letter opener tapping his lips . " Know anything about make-up ? " " I can learn . " " Anything about engraving ? " " No , sir . " " Type ? " Bart shook his head . The editor 's lips took on their pout once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bart looked for his hat . Crosby was waiting for hint to go . Perhaps he would fare betterat the Tines . " Married , hey . " It was not a question . " Yes , sir ; last week . " Bart wanted to snatch the letter opener from the man 's hand and hurl it on the floor . Why keep him in such suspense ? " What do you think you can live on ? " HOPE  --  bubbling , bursting , surging HOPE ! " On what you can afford to pay me . "   " That 's just it . If I take you and give you and your wife enough to live on , I 'll be paying you twice what you 're worth . " " I see , " Bart said dryly . " I 'll work , " he urged . " I 'll expect you to , " Crosby took him up ; " but you 'll have to be taught how to work , and that will take somebody 's time . " " I see , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but hope was burningbrightly ; Bart 's knee began to twitch . " The situation is this , " Crosby said at last , " I have a young lady on my staff , Miss Mildred Bransom , whom I 'm sending to Russia next week to investigate certain conditions there which might be the subject for an important series of articles she will write for us . She 'll be gone three or four months ; while she 's away , we 'll be short-handed . " Again the eyes to the dusty window , and the tap , tap of the bright steel implement . " Could you live on twenty-five a week ? " Bart 's mind leaped to the hundred a month the railroad had paid him , wholly inadequate even for his unmarried needs . " Certainly , " he said . " It will be a long time before you get more .. " " I understand . " ( Oh , he was going to be able to shout : " I 've got a job  --  I 've got a job ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if you like us , and we you , remember  --  1 want to male this clear  --  it will be a year , perhaps more , before you can expect a raise . That 's understood ? " " Yes , sir . " " Well , when do you want to start in ? " " To-morrow . " ( Peggy and he would have to find some cheaper lodgings that very afternoon  --  and he 'd have to write in the evenings  --  oh , every night ! More money that way . ) " You might meet some of our staff now . " Crosby rose . " May I shake your hand , sir ? I ca n't tell you how gratefulI am . " " We 'll see how it works out ; I hope you 'll fit in . " He led Bart into a number of small , dusty , glass-partitioned offices in turn . " Mr. Biddle  --  Mr. Carter . We 've just taken Mr. Carter on to help out . Mr. Biddle edits some of our departments.  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our staff . Mr. Oddie attends to our circulation . " There were others . " Mr. MacKenzie  --  Mr. Carter . We 're all very much afraid of Mr. MacKenzie . He frowns at us whenever we talk of spending money , and I 'm sure I do n't know what he 's going to say when he hears I 've boosted our pay roll . " This is Mr. Ohrstrom , our managing editor . Mr. Carter , Will ; you remember Mr. Carter 's stories ? T thought I 'd take Mr. Carter on while Miss Bransonr 's away . He 's from Californiaand seems anxious to join us . You 'll find Ohrstrom a martinet , Carter . He 'll he your boss , and I leaven help you if you keep the magazine from going to press on schedule . " Bart grinned , shook hands , tried to say something if only to sound his voice , could think of nothing , laughed at each of Mr. Crosby 's witticisms , shook hands again , followed his new employer to another office . Everybody seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a short time now before he 'd be able to run back to Peg . He could just see and hear her wild ex-citement ! ) A small office with curtains at the windows , a carpet , easy chairs , pictures on the walls . A woman rose as the men entered . " This is Miss Bransom , " the editor said . " She 's the lady who 's going to Russia . " Bart met clever eyes in a friendly , intelligent face  --  a handsomegirl with fine yellow hair , clear skin , a smooth column of throat  --  well groomed , smart , an air of briskness and dispatchabout her . She shook hands firmly . The three seated themselves ; Crosby talked . Mr. Carter was again identified as the author of short stories recently accepted ; Miss Bransom acknowledged it with a smile and a nod . It was evident she had liked them . The editor explained his plans . Bart was to take over some of Miss Bransom 's routine work : he was to send copy to the printer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engraver , receive cuts , paste up dummies , prepare clipping sheets , read manuscripts . Miss Bransom would explain the duties as much as possible in the week before she sailed . Mr. Ohrstrom would ,  | of course , supervise the work . For the few clays that remained , it might be well to have a desk moved into Miss Bransom 's room so that Mr. Carter might be in close touch . He would report in the morning . Mr. Crosby left them to become betteracquainted . And on winged feet half an hour later , Bart went springinghack to the hotel , the shout of his announcement trembling in his throat . Peggy came flying to his arms as he burst open the door , but there was no need for words as he clasped her to him , hugging her fiercely , his lips in her hair . A long afternoon of weary , disappointing house hunting . Twenty-five dollars a week was only a hundred dollars a month . " And that means , darling , " said Peggy practically , " that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary for rent . " Twenty-five dollars ! On a strip of park , shaped like a very thin wedge of pie , in a dirty Italian section near Washington Square , they found two dark unfurnished rooms where Croton bugs scuttled from out and beneath moldy plumbing  --  rent twenty a month . Third Avenue offered a tenement with swarming , yelling children , where a vacant four-room apartment might be had for twentytwo . A Jewish family was eager to rent a whole floor above their kosher restaurant for live dollars a week . A boarding house on Madison Avenue with an air of refinement and distinctionhad a vacant room and bath on the third-floor front , but the quiet , gray-haired landlady explained she would have no difficulty in obtaining the twenty dollars a week she was asking for it , despite the approaching summer . " Dearest , dearest , do n't be discouraged , " Peggy implored ; " this hunting is all part of the fun of getting settled . You 'll see ! We 'll find just the right thing . " They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you suppose it 's us ? " she asked , looking up at its non/committal exterior . " Come on , we 'll find out , and if it is , we 'll say a prayer . " It was Catholic . The prayer was said , kneeling in a dusky emptiness , the light of the dying day warming the rich stainedglasswindows . The next morning , before Bart had been seated an hour at the ink-stained , pine-topped table which had been placed for him in Miss Bransom 's office , that young lady looked up from her work and said : " Mr. Carter , Mr. Crosby was telling me yesterday afternoonyou are just married and that you and your wife are looking for a place to live . Why do n't you rent my little apartment ? You see , I sha n't be back from the other side until September , and I very much want a tenant  --  a nice one , to keep the place up and look after my things . My quarters would just suit you , I believe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them ? I 'm on East Seventy-sixth Street . " And as if God had decided to answer bounteously the petitionBart and Peggy had addressed to Him the previous afternoon , as if He were especially guiding their footsteps , Miss Bransom 's small suite at the top of a quiet , narrow four-story building appeared to be designed directly for their needs . Miss Bransom paid fifty dollars a month for the place , but she was willing to let Bart and Peggy have it for thirty-five , and while Bart pointed out that even this was more than they had planned to pay , Peggy countered with the argument that it obviated the expense of furnishing . She was in love with the tiny home , she said ; she was in love with Miss Bransom herself and told her so . " Oh , my dear , it 's just too enchanting . " It was indeed charming . At the back was the bedroom with a sizeable kitchen adjoining equipped with gas stove , ice box , and an " honest-to-goodness " sink . The room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequately furnished . It had two windows giving upon a clutter of back-yard gardens . There was no connecting passage between these rooms and the front one , except the outer public hall , but as they were on the top floor , it was just as if they all belonged to the one suite , Miss Bransom explained . The walls of the hall were borne the royal weight of King Ludwig , and nestling herself into the circle of Bart 's arms . " My fairy godmother waved her wand , and everything  --  more than everything  --  I ever wanted has just tumbled into my lap . My pumpkin has turned into a coach-and-four , and my little dead mice have all become footmen in powdered wigs and liveries " What do you mean by your pumpkin ' and little dead mice ' ? " " Oh , well , you know  --  I was just living along at the ranch , and I did n't have anything to do , and Janey was sort of bossingme " " And who bosses you now ? " She raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You muggins ! " Bart protested ; " you 're mussing all these manuscripts , efforts of struggling young authors who want to land in Crosby 's and perhaps marry their second cousins . " On the seat of a chair in front of him was a pile of manuscriptswhich must all be read before he went to bed , a report gem-clipped to each , and the bundle put on Mr. Ohrstrom 's desk in the morning . Almost every evening Bart had such a heap to plow through . It was a boring task , for after his long day he was tired and sleepy ; at night he wanted to talk and play with his wife. 11is work at the office was absorbing , perplexing , and difficult. 1 le was constantly making mistakes , and forgetting to do things . Ohrstroin was impatient , irritated by the absence of Miss Branson , who had attended , capably and smoothly , to routine duties . Bart felt he was handicapped by his dread of this man 's criticism and the fear of losing his job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wandered , perplexed , distracted , in and out of his own office , visiting MacKenzieand Ohrstrom , discussing with them the contents of future issues and circulation reports . The other young men , Biddle and Oddie , were agreeable fellows , disposed to be friendly , and they frequently asked Bart to lunch with them . But the new assistant felt he could not afford to lunch . He declined these invitations and made a habit of going without his midday meal . He and Peggy realized they must live not only within their income , but must save something each month . Both were determined , come what would , to appeal to no one.  |p237Hel|p  from Jack or Jane , from Gill or from any other member of the family , was positively never to be considered . Peggy showed herself to be not only a good cook , but an economical one and an excellent housekeeper . The dollar-a-dav they finally agreed to spend for the table , she promptly proved to be adequate , and at the end of each week , she would produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by careful planning she had managed to save out of the allowance . Bart kept himself down to a dollar a week for his personal expenditure . Almost always he walked to and from his office , and he returned to the frugal habit of rolling his own cigarettes . Often he was able to add to Peggy 's weekly savings thirty to forty cents of his own . They had a tin cup on the top shelf of the kitchen which they christened " ' The Dime Saving and Loan Society , " and into this went a steady stream of nickels , dimes , quarters , half dollars , even bills . They dipped into this fund for their week-end pleasures . Saturday nights they sometimes went to the theater , **26;498;TOOLONG seats in the gallery , dining beforehand plentifully and luxuriously at a French or Italian restaurant where a six-course table d'hote with wine might be had for fifty cents . Sundays they went to Mass . Now and then , they attended the seven o'clock service at Saint Anne 's , gobbled rolls and coffee at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Coney Island , to spend the day lolling on the sand or braving the breakers with screams and cautioning . More often they lay abed until it was time to scurry for " High , " carrying home with them later a tome of Sunday newspaper and a tiny bottle of cream to seat themselves , in what appeared to Bart to be less " than a jiffy " , to an **29;526;TOOLONG which Peggy seemed miraculously to produce without effort . Each vied in stating how wonderful the other was , in repeatingthat theirs was an adventure extraordinary . No one had ever been married in just the way they had , or started out so successfully . New York was the most ravishing place in the world to live , and  --  if intelligent people only put their minds to it  --  one of the cheapest . Life was thrilling , life was glorious , life was beautiful ! " Just think , " Bart would say , holding her hands in his ,   " just think , can you believe it ? It 's us  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're actually doing it ! " Peggy would fix wide dark eyes upon him . " Do you suppose young married people are always as happy as we are ? " " No , I do n't believe it . " " ' Tien why is it ? " " Guess because we 're lucky . " " Do n't say that , dearest , do n't say luck . ' It 's the goodnessof our Lord , it 's the blessed Virgin looking down and protectingus . " " Do you think we deserve it ? Why should we be picked out to be especially blessed ? " " Oh , I do n't know why it 's so , but let 's pray about it , sweetheart ; let 's thank God and beg Him to make us worthy of His goodness . " " I always do . " " I 'm going to ask the priest at Saint Anne 's to say a special Mass of thanksgiving for us next week . " Her eyes would film with tears . He would put his arms around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be the end of life for him if anything should happen to her . A sensation of terror would come to him at the mere thought of losing her . Throughout these glamorous days there weighed upon his mind the thought he ought to he about his writing , he must he attempting a short story . It was the only way to increase their meager income . Saving a few dollars each month was sensible , of course , but it was inevitable that they would need a great deal of money sooner or later . The time was not very far distant when new clothes would be necessary , and when Miss Bransom returned , there would be the expense of furnishing another apartment . But to write in the evenings , on Saturday afternoons or Sundays , he found well-nigh impossible . He was thoroughly fagged when he arrived home at night . There were usually manuscriptsto be read , and there was Peggy , who , after she had washed the dishes and put things away , had taken off her apron , brushed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshened and made herself lovely , would come in to interruptP239and cuddle against him , wanting to be loved . She was irresistible . Sometimes the scent of her hair turned him giddy ; sometimes the touch of her sent the blood whirling to his head . Summer came , hot , moist , enervating . The streets steamed with heat , the leaves hung limply on trees , people drooped and panted . Peggy vowed she loved it . " Oh , there 's nothing about this city i do n't love .... " Down at the magazine office , editors and clerks sat about listlessly in their shirt sleeves . Dust , coarse , smutty street dust , came in through the open windows and lay in thick , gritty layers on desks and papers ; work was accomplished haphazardly , indifferently . Ohrstrom grew petulant , unreasonable , increasingly critical . " You 're the damnedest fool , Carter ! I 'll say a prayer of thanksgiving when Miss Bransom 's back . " Fear ! The terror of losing his job ! He delighted in the atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was absorbed in the work . Crosby himself looked in , looked out , a worried expression on his clean , fresh , oldyoungface , nodded to Bart without seeing him , and anxiously debated with MacKenzie and Oddie the decline in newsstand sales . Letters from home  --  news that Tilly had a boy , and that Felix Farnsworth had died of tuberculosis  --  Gill telephoning and askingBart and Peggy down to Port Washington over the Fourth  --  Josephine writing that she was going round the world instead of to Philadelphia , with a friend who was paying all expenses  --  the beach at Coney Island on sweltering Sundays  --  tea cooling on the window sill waiting to be iced  --  Peggy in white dotted swiss , Peggy in trim , snugly fitted Dutch-necked aprons , Peggy in cool , freshly ironed linens  --  days of petty tasks and petty criticisms  --  languorous nights of love . His wife sometimes went to meet him at the entrance of Central Park when , at the end of a grueling day , he came plodding up the Avenue , a bulging satchel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinking , a brazen ball in a murky mist , children 's raucous voices raised in their evening cacophony , hurdy-gurdies tinkling in the near-far distance . Down side streets the stoops of houses would be spotted with bulky women in bulky white clothes , coatless men beside them , palm-leaf fans in hand . Crowded bus tops  --  taxis , limousines , limousines , taxis  --  hurtling in one another 's wake . Mobs filtering homeward from the Park . On one such evening Bart came upon her waiting for him at the accustomed spot , and she was in a pink dress  --  a pink , cotton print , and it lay in soft folds across her round breasts and fell in scallopy cascades to her feet . She had on a new pink hat , too , and carried a pink parasol . The dull , sweat-weary office toilers , the homeward-bound benchers from the Park , turned to look at the radiant vision she made . Bart 's heart leaped as his eyes fell upon her . " My darling ! " He could only look his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her shy glance from underneath her dark lashes made him want to take her in his arms careless of onlookers . " My dear ! " He stood and gaped at her , his satchel in one hand , his cheap straw hat in the other , held out as if for alms . " Silly ! Do n't be so foolish . People are staring ! " She was pleased none the less by the effect upon him . " Where did you get it ? " ( Jane probably . ) " Made it . " she declared . " You did n't ! " " Every stitch . " " I do n't believe it . " " Well , I did . Camilla gave me the stuff for a wedding present and told me to make it up when the hot weather came . Oh , I 've been working on it for weeks , " she admitted . " And the hat I trimmed myself on a two-bit frame I bought at Bloomingdale 's . " She flourished her parasol . " And that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Oh , I had that ; I 've had it for years . Jane bought it for me one summer when I wanted to go to a barbecue at the Bacigalupis ' . " " You look so adorable , it 's all I can do not to put my arms about you right here in the street and kiss you to death . " " Be sensible . "  | " How can I , when you look so --  " " Heavenly day ! Behave yourself . People are watching us ! " " They 're looking at you , you 're so beautiful . " " You 're a goose . " " I 'm not ; I 'm a gander  --  and I 'm going to gander you . " " I 'll call a policeman ! " " Call him  --  go on ; I dare you to .... " They sauntered homeward beneath the luxuriant shade of the trees that overhung the sidewalk from the Park , unmindfulof the heat , oblivious of the world , content wholly with each other . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Grand ! I could n't eat anything hot . " " That 's how I was able to conic to meet you . There is n't a thing to get ready ; table 's all set and everything . We might stop for ice , and maybe a quarter pint of cream . " " All right for the ice , but who gets the cream ? I know you do n't take it . " " Well , I thought perhaps you 'd like it on a chocolate puddingI 've made . " " I prefer canned cow , and you know it . " " How can you ! " " Well , I do ; I 've always preferred it That Carnationbrand ; it 's swell .... " Down two steps into the narrow entryway where bells and mail boxes for the apartments above were located . The ground floor had recently been occupied by a tailor , and often the smell of hot irons on wet woollens filled the stair-well with a sickening , stifling odor . Up the dark , narrow flight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at last , the final ascent to their own floor where in the hallway the framed photographs of Venice and Michelangelo 's ceiling brightened the walls . The door to the front room was open , the brown silk curtainsgently puffing and falling in the draft ; the table was set , a napkin covering the platters of food . At Bart 's place was a tiny package wrapped in tissue paper , tied with a pink ribbon . It caught his eye at once . One of Peg 's absurd little nonsenses ; he loved them . He went to wash and change his limp collar . The piece of ice was being vigorously spiked by Peggy 's firm hand in the kitchen ; he could hear the lumps go " plop "   into the pitcher of cold tea . Some day he 'd have to show her the proper way to make it. flow he loved his orderly , peaceful home , so reflective of his radiant girl , how he loved the graceful , fragrant girl herself , he thought , as he seated himself opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves , shining with china and silverware , with an apple , a pear , and a banana on a blue plate in its center , by way of decoration . " I 'm going to have candles as soon as it grows dark enough , and have them lit every night , " said Peggy . " You can get the best-looking glass candlesticks at the Five-and-Ten , and the candles are only five cents apiece , and they 'd last for a week , because I 'd take good care of them , and besides , we do n't dine at home every night , and I think that when we do we ought to have a pretty table , because " What 's all this foolishness ? " he interrupted , picking up the tissue-wrapped package . " Oh , just a little surprise for you --  " " You muggins ! " He untied the ribbon , unwrapped the paper ; within a small square box was a tiny china doll in a tiny crib . He took out the toy and bent puzzled brows upon it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he inquired . She flushed , not looking at him as she served the potato salad . " It 's a baby , stupid ! I 'm going to have one . "   " SORRY , " apologized the woman with a suitcase , as she jostled the man about to enter the Long Island train . She looked up , and a smile of pleased recognition lighted her face . " Why , if it is n't the doughty Bart himself ! " " Hello , Mildred . How are you ? " He fumbled with his gloves and packages , finally managing to touch the brim of his hat . " Whither bound ? " Mildred Bransom asked . " Home . It 's Saturday afternoon . We close at twelve . " " You 're living at Port Washington ? " " Yes . " " I 'm spending the week-end with the Ryans at Great Neck . Let 's sit together , if we can find a seat . " One was vacant , and Bart piled his bundles and shabby manuscript satchel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath his knees . " You certainly arc an eyeful , " he said settling beside her . He was impressed by the smartness of her attire ; she had both style and beauty . He was thinking : " She 's about thirty-seven or - eight . She looks ten years younger ; she 's come to be a very handsome woman . "   " Oh , that 's because I 've just had a facial and have on a new hat . " He took in the generous seal coat with the mink collar , her brown velvet headgear with its curling golden feather , the tan gaiters , brown shoes , gloves , purse A beautiful woman ; perhaps a bit emaciated  --  but all women were trying to be thin these days  --  and a little faded , but a lovely creature for all that . " Crosby 's must be flourishing , " he observed . " We 're getting along . We 'll pass the million mark this year , I hope . " " You 're editor now ? " " Oh , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as Mr. Crosby allows me to be But I want to hearabout you . What are you doing ? " He smiled and spread out his hands . " Still The Shoe AEgis . " " I 'm not talking about your job ! I know about that , of course . Just why you left us , I 'll never understand . " " More salary , for one thing --  " " A mess of pottage . ' " "  --  and more leisure to write , at least I thought there 'd be more . " " You did turn out Almaden . That was a corking good novel , Bart . Why have n't you kept on ? " " Oh , well , Mildred , you know : children , babies , home , Peggy , commuting I have n't the time " You ought to melee time . " " Easy to say . You do n't know how hard it is . " " I know that Almaden was one of the best stories I ever read . " " It 's nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half done , but have n't written a line on it since last summer . The manuscript'sround some place . " " Bart , you 're crazy not to goon ! You have a gifted pen , and if you 'd only keep at it , I 'm positive you 'd arrive . " He smiled a pleased , embarrassed smile , and rubbed his worn gloves together . " I had hoped there was more money in novel writing , " he said ; " I did n't expect to remain on The AEgis more ' an a year . P245I took the job just to get a start . " Turning toward her , he said with sudden candor : " You know I tore up the best piece of work I ever did . " " What ! " " Yes ; it was after Almaden . That book was well enough receivedfor me to believe T could make a go of writing , and although I netted no more than my five-hundred-dollar advance , the critics were kind . I had great hopes of becoming a novelist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the reason I quit Crosby 's . My brother Gill secured me my present position on The AEgis . It paid better , and I was to have more time to myself . So for two years I plugged away , getting up early in the mornings , working at night , and finally T finished a book ; it was called Quicksilver , and it was a god piece of work , if I do say it myself . I tool : . it to the publisher of my first book and at the end of a week lie sent for me and told me he would have none of it Oh , it 's a long history , Mildred ; I 'm afraid it would bore you . " " But it wo n't ! Go on  --  please . " " He said the novel was too long , and that he could n't publishit on account of the nice Germans in it . I had a German family in the book who were very fine people  --  admirable , praiseworthy , that sort of thing . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country was getting ready to cast in its lot with the Allies . It would n't do to bring out a novel just then which reflected creditably upon Germans and their home life ; at least , my publisher thought so . I believed if I met his objectionseverything would be all right , so I took another year at the book , rewrote it , cut it down by a quarter its length , and changed all my admirable Germans to admirable Swiss . Then I submitted it again , confident it would be accepted , but a second time it was refused . The United States was definitely going into the war then , and my publisher was afraid of the future . Well , we all were . Nobody was buying hooks ; nobody was reading . Conditions , I dare say , had a lot to do with his decision , and I guess he was right , for f could n't find any publisher who wanted my book . I sent it to one after another . When it came back for the twelfth or thirteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jammed the whole manuscriptinto the furnace . "  | " But you kept a copy ! " " I burned that , too , and all my notes . " The woman half squared herself in the seat , fixing him with a searching glance ; then she reached out with a quick gesture of her small , gloved hand , squeezed his forearm , and , dropping back , averted her face , staring out at the lights in the tunnel which had begun slowly to file past . Bart looked down at his rubber overshoes ; the snow and icy muck adhering to them from the street had melted in the warmth of the car , and formed little muddy puddles beneath his feet . Neither spoke again until the train roared out of the undergroundtube and commenced to race across the snow-patched dumping areas of Long Island . An afternoon sun was shiningcoldly from a cold sky , and gray smoke from a dozen tall chimneys streamed in the sharp wind ; here and there steel skeletons of new factories and apartment houses silhouetted themselves in black tracery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a January grip . Bart broke the silence . " What 's happening on the old magazine now ? " " Nothing much ; MacKenzie 's gone , you know . " " ' Yes , I heard so , and Ohrstrom was killed in the war . " " Flit , " Mildred elucidated . " Tom Oddie 's still with us . A good fellow . " " Yes , I always liked Toni . " " You never should have gone . You 'd ' ve been managing editor , now . " " Not with you in the running . Someone was saying only the other day that you were the smartest woman editor in New York . " " Fiddlesticks ; there 're half a dozen others . But I want to hear more about yourself . How 's Peggy ? " " Fine . " " Like Long Island ? " " It 's cheaper than town . We tried that for the first few years . Then we moved down here . It 's all right , but I hate to be wasting two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing . Four years ago , I bought my brother 's house in Port Washington . When he went in with Hoover in the Food Ad/ministration work , Gill and his wife and their small daughter moved to Washington , D. C. , and he let me have his house on easy terms . My brother 's a great guy , you know ; making scads of money . Right after the war , he secured contracts with the governments of Belgium , Czechoslovakia , Austria , and Poland to furnish them with wheat , flour , and other things . I do n't know how he did it , but he did . There was a firm of Belgian bankers behind him but anyhow he 's ' I leery A. Carter , Inc. , Investment Bankers , ' now , and he lives on Riverside Drive and has a Rolls-Royce and a chauffeur. ( ; ill 's smart . " " Tell me more about yourself .

His birthday 's to-morrow , and I 'm taking him home a couple of little presents . " " My God ! " Mildred said on a breath . " What 's the matter ? " She was silent for awhile , then : " Oh , nothing ! I was just thinking . Children , responsibilities ; life 's pretty hard . I remember so well how happy and confident you and Peggy were when you started out . How I envied you ! " " Envied us ? " " You both were so disgustingly happy , and you seemed so sure of yourselves . I was awfully in love with a man at the time ; he was n't with me . No doubt that was one of my reasons " It was Will Ohrstrom , " she broke off suddenly to tell him . " Ohrstrom ! .... Oh , I 'm sorry . " " You need n't be . I was in love with a Russian army officer two months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peggy were mad about one another , as that you were so desperately interested in your problem , the problem of living and belonging to each other .

" " Yes , indeed . " " You never long for anything else ? Fame , comfort , ease of mind , that leisure you spoke of ? " " Oh , yes , of course ; I 'd like all those things . " " But your marriage has not brought them to you . " " Perhaps not , but there 're compensations . " " No doubt , but I think five children is a tremendous load these days for any one man to carry  --  well , at any rate , for you to carry , " she amended .

Is n't that something pretty serious for you to give up ? I mean , after all , there are n't many of us who have your talent . " His face grew sober ; he was looking straight ahead of him . " I 'm just ordinary , " he said dully . " You 're not . " " The latest styles in women 's footwear ! Boots and shoes ! Sending photographs to the engravers ' ! Keeping track of cuts ! That 's about my speed ! " " You 're . . . . Oh , you make me sick ! " Please , Bart , forgive the impertinent question : What are they paying you down there ? " " A hundred a week .

" " Well , I 'm making twelve thousand , and my bonus last week , which was the end of the year , was over three thousand more ! " " Gee  --  that 's great ! " He was genuinely surprised and pleased . " My dear , if I had your talent , I could make twice as much . " " Oh , come , Mildred , you exaggerate . I 'm not that clever . I 'd like to write , of course , and perhaps I could make five thousand a year at it , but I 'd never be popular . In any case , I ca n't afford to take the gamble . "   " Will you try some short stories for us ? " " Certainly , but I 'm no good at short stuff . " " We pay much better prices , you know , than we used to .

Will you come and have lunch with me some day and talk it over ? " " Surely . " " When ? " " Sometime soon . " " Will you positively call me up ? " " Positively . " Mildred continued to regard him . There was an odd expression in her eyes ; it embarrassed him . She asked : " Where is The AEgis published ? In the same old antiquated barn ? " " The Gotham House . It 's substantial . " " It 's substantial enough for a substantial fire ! Anyway , it may not burn down for a fortnight , and if I do n't hear from you by that time , expect a phone message from me . I 'd like to know something about that Quicksilver book of yours  --  what it was about , and if it is n't possible for you to reconstruct it . What 's the new one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a love story , you know , early Californiadays ; I wanted to try something romantic . Think it 's silly ? " " Silly ? Why I Oh hell !

" she said , keeping hold of his hand as he took hers in good-bye . " Surely . " " I 'll count on it . " He lifted his hat and went back to his scat . The houses with their storm doors and windows , snow ledges on roofs and sills , their lawns and gardens spotted with ugly patches of sooty snow , began slowly to move by again . His mind was on a poem about a garden  --  a rose garden which storm and wind had changed to a barren , rutted , rocky waste , and at the foot of one gnarled and weather-beaten tree a single rose had somehow come to flower upon an old tatteredhush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been beautiful came and plucked the rose and bore it away .... The first lines of the verse were forming in his mind , as the train slid into Port Washington . It was a long walk from the station . A northeaster was blowing , and the wind came whipping and cutting off the Sound . Mounds of dirty snow edged the cold hard sidewalks , and glassy ice filmed the slush holes in the frozen road beds . The branches of young saplings , bordering the streets , were stripped bare , and cut the wind with whistling sounds . Bart bent his head to the gustiness , his coat collar turned up , and trudged on , conscious of his cold hands in his worn gloves and his tingling ear tips . He saw young Miller in front of his house trying to start his car , pouring hot water from a steaming kettle into the radiator . " Dutch " McBride was splitting chunks of wood in his back yard , the ax blade flashing each time he swung . The Rosenhauws were getting in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enright was sprinkling ashes on the icecoveredstoop before his front door. " f it keeps on this way , " Milt called , " we 'll be getting the ice boats out ! " Huddling close together on the brick steps which led from the street to the cement walk encircling the house , Bart came upon his two boys , Danny and Johnny . Danny was wielding a large jackknife in his mittened hand , cutting into a piece of wood , while John was absorbed in watching . Both scrambled to their feet at sight of their father and rushed upon him , grabbing him about the neck as he bent to kiss them . " Dad , c'n Johnny and I go over to Shields ' pond ? Cyril'scoming up from the Hollow to take us , but Mom said you'dknow best about the ice , an ' for us not to go until you came . " Danny talked in the same breathless way as his mother . Bartloved it . As he frowned now judiciously , he was conscious ofp251eager pinched-faced little John , hopefully standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , boys , how about the ice ? I do n't know how thick it is ; and you have n't any skates , have you ? " " Oh , we just slide and have loads of fun . " " Cyril will test her out , Dad . All the boys are going over . " " Well , neither of you is a fool , " Bart said ; " use your noodles and be careful . " " Oh , yes , sir , we will . " They hugged him again , their hard , fresh young faces against his own . Dan was like his uncles , Jack and Gill , big with the same sturdy squareness ; John was smaller , hut strong and wiry . He did not resemble anyone particularly . Both were fine boys , healthy , tumbling , noisy , active youngsters ; Bart was proud of them . They looked specially well in their belted Mackinawcoats and Mackinaw caps . As he mounted the steps , he decided that on the first sunny day he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the folks in California . Before ascending the wooden steps which rose from the level of the walk to the glassed-in front porch , he glanced up at his home , taking in its proportions , its generous lot , with another feeling of pride . The house was a double one with four fair-sized rooms downstairs and four bedrooms above . In the rear , an extension contained the kitchen and laundry , and over these was a servant'squarters , a long narrow room which included the head of the back stairway . This connected directly with the room Bart and Peggy occupied , and was used as a nursery for Dickey , the baby , while Kate , the broad-hipped , weighty , goodnaturedIrish girl , who had been with them ever since they had come to Port Washington , occupied one of the larger chambers on the same floor . The house was just big enough to hold them comfortably as it stood , and the Lord only knew , Bart used often to think , what they would do if the family grew any bigger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , Margaret and Janey occupied the next , above his study , Kate enjoyed in solitude the chamber in the west corner , and he and Peggy had the one adjoining . The bathroom at the end of the hall upstairs served for all . Gill had been very generous about letting him buy the place . That he could afford to be was no reason , Bart frequently reminded himself , why his good-heartedness should ever be questioned . Alice Dawson , Gill 's wife , had unexpectedly inherited a fortune from her grandfather ; her father dying almost the same day , the old man 's estate had cone directly to her . Gill had suddenly found himself the husband of a rich wife . The war broke . His first move had been to dispose of The Shoe AEgis , the outstanding publication among his late father-in-law 's trade journal enterprises , to one Max Solomon and associates , and next to rid himself of his wife 's remaining interests in the Dawson Publishing Company . Approaching Bart at the same time , he had offered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had paid for it , agreeing to take back a second mortgage to help him finance the deal . As even this required more income than Bart could command , Gill , by a " high-power sales talk , " persuaded Mr. Solomon to " take on " his younger brother at twice the salary he was receiving at Crosby 's . Gill had then promptly departed for Washington and rarer and larger fields of activity . Bart was grateful ; he kept repeating to himself he was grateful , yet there persisted a suspicion that Gill had made use of him . " You 're just a plain ungracious pig ! " he said aloud as lie stamped heavily on the wooden steps to dislodge the slush and ice from his rubber-shod feet and forced open the weatherstrip-bounddoor of the glass-sheltered porch . De left his rubbersthere , pushing them off with either foot , and entered the grateful warmth of the house . A noise of bumping , thumping , and of children 's voices greeted him from the sitting room . Apprehensively , he glanced in . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusing themselves with a game called " playing cave . " Chairs had been tipped on their faces and sides and these covered with blankets , floor rugs , bedspreads , any kind of drapery which could be impressed into service , and through the dark tunnels thus formed the children crawled about on hands and knees , encountering one another in the dark passage with cries of joy or alarm . To-day the chenille curtains , which hung on either side of the folding doors between dining and sitting rooms , had been unhooked from their rings and utilized in the game . Mentally Bart sighed ; it meant that , later , he and none otherp253would have to bring up the stepladder from the basement and restore the curtains to their places Oh , well , it wasSaturday afternoon , and too cold for them to be playing out of doors . Margaret , the four-year-old , the shrewdest and brightest of his children , put out her head between two of the covers and piped a shrill welcome at sight of him . Scrambling through the opening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draperies dragging , chairs tumbling in a clatter ; Jane , aged six , emerged from the far side and trotted in her wake ; their little playmates , in whom he recognized Commodore Westover 's daughters , thrust out curly , tousled heads and stared up at him . " Hello , darlings  --  hello , hello . Cave , hey ? You 'll put things away , wo n't you ? Where 's your mother ? " " She 's up with the baaa-bv " Margaret shrilled , hugging him . Peggy 's quick tread was heard on the stairs . She descended halfway , then stooped to peer beneath the top of the door into the sitting room . " Hush  --  all of you ! Heavenly day , what a bedlam ! You know the baby 's asleep ! Goodness , you 're making enough racket to wake the dead ! .... Oh , hello , darling ; glad you 're home . " She kissed Bart over the banisters . " Tired , sweetheart ? " " So-so . " " I 'm sorry , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because I 'm horribly afraid the pipes are burst , and Kate ca n't get a drop of water out of them , so she 's cross as two sticks . " " Did you telephone Jones ? " " In the first place , I was n't sure , and in the second , I did n't want that old dodderer fumbling round here if there was n't any real reason . Besides , I did n't have time You will keepquiet , girls , wo n't you ? Dickey ought to sleep for another half hour . " Bart took off his overcoat , hung it in the overflowing closet beneath the stairs , and carried his satchel of office papers into the room generally referred to as his study . " To-day , however , Peggy had been doing some sewing there . The rug was covered with pins , threads , snips of cloth ; a sewing machine was backed up against a bookcase . Sighing again , he went kitchen- ward to inspect the faulty plumbing . There , Kate , revealing herself from behind a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a recital of the inconvenience to which she had been put by the lack of water . Started on this topic , her eloquence stirred her , and other grievances coming to mind , she poured them forth in a mounting , self-agitating recital of wrongs , ending in a flat affirmation that the work was too hard for any Christian woman , and as nobody appreciated her services after four long years of doing her best , she might as well give notice and find another place . Bart began with light words of sympathy and praise to soothe her and to dispose of her troubles , which ranged all the way from impertinences of the butcher to forays on the ice box and pantry stores by depredating small boys . But at the appalling possibility of the woman 's actually deserting them , he sat down in one of the kitchen chairs and , drawing breath , attacked the situation with serious reasoning , settling one difficultyafter another , ending triumphantly with the big-hearted Irishwoman mopping her eyes and telling him he was the most understanding employer she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindest woman she knew , and that there were no clearer or finer children in the whole world than the Carter quintette . Peggy 's sharp summons down the back stairs for Kate to bring up Dickey 's " woollies , " a species of garment including leggings , sweater , and hooded cap , came somewhat inopportunelyat this moment , but Kate sniffing-1y obeyed , and Bart , congratulating himself that a crisis had been successfully handled , went to inspect the laundry tubs , to discover that , alas , the pipes had indeed burst and that it was unavoidably and urgently a case for Jones . Upstairs he found Dickey lying luxuriously on a bath towel spread upon the bed , and Peggy washing the child 's buttocks and fat legs with a soapy wash cloth . The room was warm and smelled of the kerosene burner and the soaked sheet from the crib which had been hung upon a chair before the stove to dry . Bart leaned over the bent figure of his wife and proddedP255his youngest son in the center of his small , fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air , his smile displaying a creditable row of small teeth in an area of red gum . " Dad-dee , Dad-dee , Dad-dee , Dad-dee .... " " He ought to be ashamed of himself , " Peggy said ; " a big boy , his age ! " " Hello , Two-year-old , " Bart addressed him . " I brought you home something you 're going to like , hut you ca n't have nuffin ' till to-morrow , and to-morrow hate 's going to make you a great big cake with two whole candles on it . " " What in the world were you gabbing with her about ? " Peggy wanted to know . " Oh , she was in one of her temperamental moods . I had to pat her on the back and calm the troubled waters of her spirit . " " I wish you would n't bother with her . You go down there and agree with her , telling her how wonderful she is and how she 's abused and all that , and it does n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I wo n't get her to do a single blessed thing for a month ! .... Oh , I heard you ! " " But , my dear , she was going to quit ! " " Nonsense ! She would n't quit for anything . The minute you come round , she feels she has to blow off a lot of steam because you 're always ready to listen to her and make her feel she 's put upon , that I do n't appreciate her , and it just makes it a million times harder for me " Oh , come , come , come , " he remonstrated , putting an arm across her shoulders and drawing her to him ; " stop your crabbingand kiss your old man . What 's the big idea ? Do n't you ever kiss your husband any more when he comes home ? " She lifted her round , rosy face and laid her flushed , warm cheek against his own for a moment . The scent of talcum powder was about her , and her hair was sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he loved to breathe . She seemed strong and vital as he held her iii his arms ; but with all her firmness , she was still soft and tender . Childbearinghad ripened her . She gave herself to him now , but returned his kiss distractedly , her eyes upon the sprawling , half-dressed baby on the bed . She strove to pull away , but Bart would not let her go ; he hugged her closely , kissing the smooth curve of her neck and hare shoulder . " Bart , Bart , " she protested ; " please ! I simply ' ve got to get this child out while there 's still some warmth in the sun . In an hour it will be too wretchedly cold . " " Aw , let him wait , " he said hungrily , breathing deeply of her sweetness . She freed herself with a determined push , and sitting upon the bed , began expertly to jerk Dickey 's legs and arms into his " woollies , " pulling the thick , furry hood well down over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips , a perplexed wrinkle marking his brow . He yearned for her , his love growing big . Peggy was superb ; it was surprising how well she ran the house and the children ; she was always planning , or working , and when she complained it was rarely of or for herself . Vital , he thought  --  strong and vital . He often wondered how it was she remained so fresh and sweet ; she never gave a thought to her personal appearance ; even now , one thick braid of hair had loosened , an end dangling on her shoulder , a streak of powder marked her neck , and her hands were hard and knuckly , the finger tips rough , the nails blunt . He noticed the white firm globes of her full breasts as she bent over her task , and the flawless sculptured valley between them . " Dearest , " she said , fastening the last button of Dickey 's sweater , " his rubbers are down there in all that mess on the floor of the stairs ' closet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  andput them on him . I must get at this room , and I 'm trying to finish up that dress for Janey I promised her at Christmas . " " Surely , " he told her ; " and I 'll do more : I 'll drag this kid on one of the boys ' sleds clear down to the Yacht Club and back if you 'll give your husband a kiss and a real one . " Her dark eyes widened with pleasure . " Oh , my dear , will you ? I did n't know what I was going to do with him this afternoon , because I 'm just up to my neck with all kinds of things , and I hated to ask Janey and Margaretto take him out , because it 's so wretchedly cold and they are having such a good time with their game . Indeed I 'll kiss you , and I only wish it might be more . " P257She put her round smooth arms about his neck and raised her lips to his . He strained her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the blood beat up into his head and throbbed behind his closed eyelids . It seemed to him he could not breathe deeply enough of her . " God ! " he said , hugging her , and again , " God ! " After a little , they drew apart , holding each other at arm 's length , their lips parted , their eyes shining . " God ! " Bart said once more ; then : " Is n't it wonderful to love each other this way after ten years ? " Peggy did not answer ; she stood looking at him , still smiling , her eyes traveling over his face , feature by feature . She kissed him lightly then on the tip of his nose , pushed past him , hurrying into Dickey 's nursery , and commenced pulling his soiled and rumpled crib apart . Jones promised to come " the first thing Monday morning , " and Bart set his mittened , muffled , and hooded youngest on Dan 's sled and , strapping him on board , proceeded to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill , and along the rutted , icy lane which led to the Yacht Club . The wind whipped coldly at him , wrapping the flaps of his overcoat about his legs , and his feet continually slipped and slid a little on the frozen surfaces . Dickey 's fat cheeks were apple red , and he shouted boisterously whenever his father paused for breath . The Club was bleak , wind-blown , and deserted . A field of gray , lumpy ice stretched out into the water along the shore , and toward the upper end of the Bay the pack formed an unbrokensheet clear to the Great Neck side . A number of boats lay jacked up on trestles along the beach ; the wind tore at their lashed protecting canvases , fluttering them angrily . Bart looked in at the empty square hall where the ( lances were held ( luring the summer . Windows rattled in the draft made by the door he had opened , and an American flag , draped behind the musicians ' stand , billowed toward him with a hostile flap . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boxes packed with Christmas tree tinsel and ornaments had been piled , and in another stood some square cartons containing a few left-over favors used at the Hallowe'en dance . He appropriated a paper witch and a diminutive jack o'lantern to amuse Dickey , and then turned back , plodding step by step up the steep incline toward home . As he climbed the hill , his thoughts returned to Mildred Bransom . A fine woman , intelligent , attractive . . . . a damn smart editor . . . . certainly she had made good . He might have had her job . She had said so herself . At any rate , she knew her business , and she had told him he could write , urged him to keep at it . That story , The Hacienda , had a good idea in it . He 'd take a look at it after Peggy and the kids were in bed that evening . He might be able to finish it in six months . He wondered what Mildred would think of it . The first glimpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had occurred . One of Thornwall 's taxis stood at the door . The driver and another man were standing on the sidewalk before it , conversing . As Bart came up , the latter introduced himself ; he was Mrs. Shields ' butler . Johnny , it appeared , had broken through the ice on the pond , had been completely submerged , but had clung to the edge of the hole until his companions , with the aid of some planks , had succeeded in fishing him out . They had brought the drenched , half-frozen little boy up to the Shieldses ' kitchen to be warmed , and Mrs. Shields , after putting some dry clothing on him , had told her butler to telephone for a taxi and take the boy home with his brother . Johnny was all right , the man assured Bart ; his mother had put him in bed and was giving him a hot drink . In the boys ' room upstairs , Bart found the family and the girls ' small friends gathered about Johnny 's bed . Peggy was at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the youngster himself and his brother Dan continued to interrupteach other in a garbled report of the accident . " I yelled at him , Mom , honest I did ; I yelled : Fall on your belly , you big fool ! ' Of course , he did n't hear me , ' cause he was going lickety-split after the buck " ' Buck ' ? I do n't understand . "   " Aw , gee , that 's what we play hockey with ! Cyril gave it an awful swat " It was n't Cyril , it was Spud ' Miller " " It was not ! " " It was too " " Go on , I 'll betcher ! I 'll betcher a nickel it was n't Spud . ' " Peggy looked up and smiled at her husband as he came in , the baby slung like a sack tinder his ann . " We 've had quite a scare . ' Thev told you ? " " Yes ; the men downstairs did . How is lie ? " " Oh , fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for yourself ! " " You do n't want to send for Doc Adams ? " " Oh , no ; why should I ? He 's perfectly all right . " " Was it cold , Johnny ? " " Golly  --  you bet ! " " Were you scared ? " " Aw , gosh , no ; there was nothing to be scared about . The fellows were all there . I just hung on until they came and pulled me out . " " Mrs. Shields was certainly most kind . I 've already called her up and thanked her . I 'll never forget her kindness as long as I live . " P260JOHNNY 'S period of enjoying the family 's solicitude was shortlived . There came a slithering crash from his room a few minutes after his parents had left it which brought both back on the run and awoke Dickey , asleep after his five-o'clock bottle , with a wail of fright . It proved nothing more serious than a broken windowpane caused by a misdirected pillow aimed at a taunting Dan . Peggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy and ordered John to get up and dress for dinner . Bart was pleased . He did not like it when any member of the family was absent from the dinner table . He enjoyed it when they were all there , with Peggy opposite him , ladling out soup from the tureen or serving the vegetables and dessert . He himself always attended to the meat . To-night there were corn soup and a browned leg of lamb , roasted potatoes , lima beans , and steaming lint beets ; the dessert was floating island , one of Kate 's triumphs , popular with all . His eyes went fondly from child to child around the table . They were all healthy youngsters , although each had had his or her share of sickness . Last spring , the baby had given them a serious time of worry ; Peggy 's milk had grown too rich for him ; Dickey had to be weaned . For weeks Doc Adams had been obliged to experiment with various formulas before finding one to agree with him . It had been only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked suspiciously like diphtheria , and all the children had to be inoculated , and just before Christmas Dan had dislocated his shoulder while sledding , and to-day , here was Johnny breaking through the ice and nearly getting himself drowned ! They seemed to invite disease and disaster , Bart thought . " Dad , now lissen : I 'm awfully sorry about that window ; P261honest to goodness I am , an ' I feel fine  --  no chill nor nothin '  --  and c'n I go to the movies with Dan ? Gee , Pop , truly , I feel fine . Ask Mom . " Bart looked across the table for his cue . " I do n't see why he should n't , " Peggy said ; " I 'll bundle him up warm , and  --  you 'll come straight home afterwards , wo n't you , boys ? " " Oh , sure , Mom ; straight . " " You see , it 's Saturday night , " Peggy explained . " What 's the picture , Dan ? " Bart always asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie , but it was seldom he was able to see one . Peggy would not leave the baby alone , and he did not like going without her . Moreover , there was usually office work to be done . Ile asked the picture 's name , nevertheless , hoping it might he one so alluring that the temptation to see it would override other considerations . His is question , however , never received a better answer than Dan 's present : " Oh , something or other I do n't know . " Hurrying through the meal , the boys departed for the early performance . Bart helped pile the dishes , which Janey and Margaret carried in small lots to the slide window through which Kate 's large , disposing hands received them . He next went down to the basement and brought up the ungainly stepladder . While he was rehanging the sitting-room curtains , Peggy induced her small daughters to aid her in picking up the threads and scraps from the study floor . " I thought the Fultons might drop in for bridge to-night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rickety perch , Bart let fall his hands holding the curtain , and a breath of distaste escaped him . He had counted on reading over his manuscript , The Hacienda , that evening . Playing cards with Peggy too often resulted in unpleasantness ; she was an indifferent player , yet resented any word of criticism . Particularly he regretted a visit from the Fultons , as he cordially disliked Mrs. Fulton , who was ogling , assertive , and talkative . Whenever Peggy said someone might drop in , he was sure that that person had been invited and was positively coming . He wagged his head and drew a second heavy breath . If obliged to put aside his work , there were many things he pre- ferred doing to playing bridge with the Fultons : going with his two boys to the movies for one thing , and for another , on Saturday nights the " gang " always gathered at the Yacht Club . The " gang " were the men he liked best among his neighbors . On Saturday nights during the winter , none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the men played Five hundred , and the club steward served coffee and sandwiches at midnight . Ren Small would be there , and " Dutch " McBride , Percy Hacket , Chip Rhodes , contractors , real estate men , master mechanics were the types . Most of them had their business interests in the town , and Bart found contact with them stimulating and diverting . They seemed to relieve him of the pressure of life somehow . Janey and Margaret were put early to bed , each supplied with a book , and told to pull out the electric light above their heads promptly at nine . Kate heavily departed  --  she always went out in the evenings to visit friends in the Hollow  --  and a little after eight , the Fultons announced their arrival by a vigorous honk-honking of their motor horn , and noisily trouped in . The evening turned out exactly as Bart had feared . The guests won continually , Maud Fulton casting arch glances in his direction , rubbing her knee against his own . Peggy bid with bad judgment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and there was an edge to his tone  --  her eyes filled , and for the rest of the rubber Bart saw she was biting her lips to keep from crying . When again she could trust herself to speak , she avoided addressing him or meeting his penitent look . Ile was increasingly irritated : at the run of the cards , at Bob Fulton 's strong cigar , at Maud Fulton , who recognized his dark mood and sought to cheer him out of it by nudges of her knee and covert , ogling glances , at himself for agreeing to play , and more particularly for being such a fool as to criticize his wife . At a few minutes past nine , the boys came in , kissed their parents , and thumped upstairs to bed . At eleven , Peggy brought from the kitchen a tray of ginger ale and cookies . At quarter to one , the Fultons went home with Bart 's check for fourteen dollars . Then , at last , he could square himself to the work of making peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be accomplished , but there was no alternative ; Peggy must be consoled , and they must be friends once more before they went to sleep . Humbly , penitently , patiently , he addressed himself to the task . No , Peggy did n't want to discuss it ; no , she was too tired ; no , there was no need for him to say he was sorry ; it was all right ; she was n't in the least provoked ; no , it was all right . Of course , the Fultons had gone home laughing at them  --  laughing and joking about a man who did n't know how to speak to his wife  --  and laughing and joking about a wife who put up with it ... . Bart must reiterate his regret and self-condemnation ; he must unceasingly implore forgiveness . Tears at last , and he saw them with relief , recognizing the first step towards capitulation . Yet it tore his heart to see her cry . She did not weep like most women . Large crystal tears welled up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally her chin quivered like a little girl 's . But there was never a sob nor a sniff . He watched her , his fingers locked together , beating his clasped hands slowly upon his knee in distress . She took up the baby , carried him to the bathroom , smoothed his sheets and pillow , pinned his covers to the corners of the mattress with horse-blanket pins , while her tears slowly fell . She turned up the unlit wick of the kerosene stove , placing a match box upon its metal top to have it handy in the frigid hour of waking , undressed , donned wrapper and slippers , and sat down before her dressing table to braid her hair . Still the drops fell , and now and then her small round chin shook . Bart 's misery became unbearable . He could not understand how his criticisms of her playing , tart-sounding though they might have been , could bring such grief . He told himself again and again he was both a criminal and a fool . When she rose , he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he seized her in his arms  --  " I ca n't stand it , I just ca n't bear it another minute . . . . " Perhaps it was the ringing note of pain in his voice , perhaps it was his exasperated determination to tolerate her stubbornnessno longer , perhaps it was the very roughness with which he handled her , but he saw with a great outpouring of love for her and joy for himself , the first flicker of softening in her eyes . Once she had begun to weaken , he knew that complete pardon was not far off . " Sweetheart , you will forgive me ? " " Yes  --  yes , I 'll forgive you . " " I 'm such a surly , unmannerly pup ! " " No , you 're not that ; I 'm too sensitive , that 's all . " " Darling , I 'll never say boo ' to you in a bridge game as long as I live . " " That 's the only way I 'll ever learn to play . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go through when you 're mad at me ! " " I 'm sorry , dearest ; truly , I am . " " I 'm the one to be sorry ; do n't you go apologizing to me ! " " I 'm terribly sorry just the same . " " You 've nothing to be sorry for . " " I 'm a silly fool . " " You 're not ; you 're adorable . " " If you only will always think so . " " Do you love me ? " " You know I do . " " Would you marry me again ? " " A hundred times . " " You muggins ! Kiss me . " Their lips met , the heat of their hearts rose . They drew apart , hooking into one another 's eyes ; slowly they came together again , arms enfolding , clasping each other , mouth against mouth , while senses commenced to swim , and their breathing quickened . One primitive , compelling urge filled Bart 's being . In his arms was the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mate . He wanted her . He pulled her over toward the bed . She sank to its side , but in a moment wrenched herself free , pushing him away , holding him from her with strong arms , panting while she struggled to find her voice . " No-no , Bart , no-no . Be sensible , dear . Wait ! Let 's think ! We must n't , Bart  --  we must n't ; it would mean another baby positively , and we do n't want another just yet . Listen , listen , darling . Wait a moment . Please . Not another . Bart , not an-P265other just yet . Wait until we get ahead , wait until you get a raise or we have a little more put away . That would mean six , Bart  --  six children  --  and , oh , I 'd be fat and clumsy and goodfor-nothingfor nine months , and I need every bit of myself forthe others --  " " But I love you , Peg --  " " I know , dear --  " " And you love me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then is this sort of thing to go on for the rest of our lives , you always repulsing toe ? " " My dear , I 'm not repulsing you ! " " What do you call it ? " " I do n't know , I do n't know ! T only know it would be simply madness for us to have another baby right away . " " Darling , listen . . . . " While she had been speaking , she had risen to her feet , and had tried to free hersel f from his detaining hands . Now he drew her down forcibly beside him on the bed . " Why not be sensible , sweetheart , " he went on , " and do what Doc Adams suggests " " Peg , darling , " he urged , as she commenced to shake her head , " hear me out  --  please , .... if you love me ! Other people do it , thousands and thousands and thousands . I 'll bet there is n't a woman you know who does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are lots of perfectly safe and sure ways " " No , no , Bart , it 's wrong --  " " It is n't ! We 've been over and over this  --  a thousand times ! We 're both agreed we have all the children we want . I 'll never be a rich man , and we 've got to face that fact . We do n't want to go downhill and get in debt , bringing more and more babies into the world " " I know all that , " she interjected ; " I do n't want to be like Aunt Lizzie or Eva Ann ; I do n't want any more children --  " " Well , what are we going to do about it ? Are we going to go on for the next ten or fifteen years , living together and loving , and never knowing each other ? What ( 10 you expect will become of us ? What do you expect me to do ? ... .   " Peg , you 're not like most women ; Doc Adams says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's never a week in the month when it is safe for you . Three times now , we thought it was O K to go ahead ; you figured it all out , and what happened ? Jane , and then Margaret , and then , two years ago , the baby . Do you know how long it has been since I 've had you ? Over a year ! Most men can enjoy their wives while they 're nursing ; I ca n't . You were still nursing Johnny  --  he was n't six months old  --  when you became pregnant again . You 're never safe . My God , sometimes I 'm almost afraid to kiss you ! Doc Adams says he knows lots of women like you . We do n't dare take a chance . Why not be sensible and do what Doc suggests , or let me do something ? " Straightening herself , Peggy looked at him with sternness , and there was the light of determination in her eyes . " Bart , I 'd never dare go near the Sacraments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you ask me . It 's a mortal sin , and there is n't any question about it . When I went to confession to Father Francis before we were married , I asked him straight out about this thing then , and I 've twice talked about it to Father Hennessy ; both say it 's wrong , and that no true woman would ever do such a thing , and that the Church is unalterably opposed to it --  " " Rubbish ! " " Bart Carter ! Do n't you dare say it 's rubbish ! " " Eight women out of ten practise birth control , and Catholic women , too . " " That 's not so , and your just saying so does n't prove it . I have a conscience and a soul , and I could n't look my children  --  my Janey and my Margaret  --  in the face , if I stooped to anything so degrading and unnatural --  " " Aw , come off , Peggy . " " I wo n't come off , and if you think what you ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why is there a law in this country making it a penitentiary offence for anybody to send informationthrough the mails which will tell people how not to have babies ? " " Because it 's a damn fool law , and we 're the only country in the world that has one like it . " Peg , " he began again in more conciliatory tones , " you'reP267all wrong about this thing  --  truly you are . Let me ask Doc Adams to come up here and have a talk with you . He 'll tell you what 's what ; he 'll set you straight in a jiffy . " " Doctor Adams ca n't advise or make me do something I know is a sin . " " Oh , gee , Peg , " Bart said wearily . " We 're man and wife to have babies , and we cease being man and wife when we deliberately go about preventing ourselvesfrom having babies . I ) Ming what you ask me is horrible , and I could n't love you if I did what was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peg , " he repeated , suddenly losing interest . He leaned toward her and kissed her lightly on the cheek , rose and got into bed , jerking the covers over his shoulder , settling his head in the pillow . He knew Peggy was kneeling beside her own bed , praying . After a long time he heard her rise , open the windows , and snap out the lights . Her bed springs squeaked as she lay down . After a little : " Good-night , Bart .... " " Good-night , dear , " he answered , but his jaws were shut . For another hour he lay awake , thinking over his married life , remembering particularly the hopeless , defeated feeling that had come to him when Peggy had told him , eight months after Johnny was born , another child was on the way . That had been a terrible moment for him , a moment which had stretched to days and weeks and months , in fact , had altered all his life . Something had gone out of him then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him ; in its place , he had accepted drudgery , the shoe magazine , realizing he must bend all his energies to his job , make money , try for a raise . Then , after Janey had been horn , in a few months there had been Margaret , and in little over a year , Peggy had again come to him , this time tearfully , to confess she had started again . Another baby ; Dickey , this time ! Tn five years , Bart 's entire point-of-view had altered , and he with it . He had become a totally different person , he knew ; he was only a clerk , now , a commuter , a plodding suburbanite with a wife and five children ! The war ! He had desperately wanted to go to the first Plattsburgtraining camp . From the first he had recognized it was an impossibility , but he liked to talk of it . Others had gone ; he had seen them off with a smile , but no one had suspected the darkness of his soul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same year he experienced the bitter disappointment of his publisher'srefusal of Quicksilver .. . IIe remembered standing in the Pennsylvania Station , his rejected manuscript under his arm , waiting for Peggy , who had brought the children to the city to be photographed . It had been arranged they were to meet " under the clock " and take the five-twenty out to " Port . " When she finally appeared , herdingthe two little boys before her , the toddling Janey 's hand in hers , the two-months-old Margaret in her free arm , he saw she was on the point of collapsing with fatigue . He had not the heart to break the news to her then . As they stood waiting for the train gate to open , Janey 's milk bottle , wrapped up along with the baby in her mother 's arms , in some way slipped from the folds of the shawl and crashed to the stone pavement , spattering glass and milk for yards around . There had been a little titter in the crowd . That broken , splintered bottle had seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his hopes . Ile had tried his best iii Quicksilver , he had given all he had to the book , believing that by industry and perseverance he could establish himself , and , to use an old phrase of Gill 's , " pull himself up by the boot straps , " and win recognition as a writer . Vividly he recalled the earnest talk he had had with Peg in ' 16 , when he had tried to make her understand what success would mean to him , to her , to the children . She had listened wide-eyed , attentively , but he had seen  --  all too clearly  --  she had lost faith in him . For six years she had patiently endured his attempts , encouraging him at times , humoring him at others , and still again frankly unsympathetic . As he had struggled , painstaking , laboriously , she had grown more and more impatient . The long hours at his desk , at night , in the mornings , on holidays and Sundays and half Saturdays , took him from her ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Quicksilver was returned , rejected by one publisher after another , she lost her last shred of confidence in his literary ability . Looking hack , Bart could see that even the publication of his first novel had meant little more to her than the satisfaction she had derived from showing a copy to Maud Fulton and some of the neighbors saying " My husband'sbook ; have you seen it ? It 's just published Oh , yes , Bart wants to become a writer You liked it ? Oh , that'ssimply darling of you to say so .... " He thought of Mildred who knew , and of the embers of his half-dead ambition which with a few words from her of real understanding and appreciation she had fanned to flame ... . Ah , well , Peggy had n't been brought up to literature ; she did not have time to read ; she was t ( o busy looking after the house and the children . What about children , more of them ? No . Not another , not a sixth ! That would he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have another child ! Was n't that just what Peggy had said ? Oh , yes , of course . . . . of course ; she was right . . . . always ... . That unfinished novel of his . . . . it was n't so bad . Mildred might think it good . It was good , as he remembered it ; it had a popular appeal . Love stories always " went "  --  and the yarn was not slush ! Peggy ? God , how he wished she was lying beside him right that moment , her lovely head with its fragrant braids resting on his shoulder , his arm about and beneath her , sleeping nextto him the way she used to when they were first married ! How adorable she was ! He pressed his face into the soft , inanimate pillow against his cheek , drew it to him , sighed wearily , and fell asleep . Shortly . after five o'clock the next morning , Dickey woke both parents by thumping on the wall with his empty milk bottle . Bart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took away the milk bottle , shook his fist at his son , and , shivering , went back to bed . At six , he dragged himself out again , donned slippers and wrapper , descended the back stairs and the flight to the basement below , to shake down the furnace and turn on the damper ; at six-thirty , he was dressed , overcoated , mulfled , and  --  successfully starting the old trustworthy Dodge on the first engine turnover  --  brought the car around to the front door and superintended the family getting into it : Dickey on Kate 's lap next the driver 's seat , Peggy and the four other children crowded in back . Early Mass , a frigid church , Father Hennessy murmuring disconsolately on the altar ; cold , sharp , frosty air , the wheels of the car crunching through brittle ice ; breakfast between eight and nine  --  hot , delicious ,  --  the Sunday morning papers in rustling , cascading sheets over the dining-room floor ; the children absorbed in the " funnies " ; a flurry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write ; a letter ; Mrs. Small ringing up to talk to Peggy ; Commodore Westover telephoning to know if Bart would serve on the Yacht Club 's Entertainment Committee ; tinkering with the Dodge which needed its crank case drained ; Peggy calling him to turn the ice-cream freezer ; Peggy calling him to take Dickey his bottle ; Peggy calling him to dinner . After he had eaten  --  and eaten too heartily  --  he hunted for the manuscript of The Hacienda and discovering it in a drawer beneath the bookshelves , spread it out on his desk and began to turn its scrawled and crisscrossed pages . As he was becoming interested , Dickey woke up , fretting and whimpering from his nap . Peggy said she thought lie was cutting another tooth and brought him clown to the study , asking if he might not play about on the floor . It was really too cold for him to go out , she said . The children racketed through the house , a neighbor 's little girl came in to join them , and Janey yowled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a definite " no " to her plea to be allowed to play " cave " again . Towards four o'clock , Peggy , pitying him , took the crowd out of doors , pushing Dickey 's go-cart before her , the older children cavorting in her wake . Bart hopefully settled down to his manuscript , only to have a compelling drowsiness overcomehim . He struggled against it , gave up , and climbed the stairs to his room , to fling himself gratefully upon his bed . Supper , beans , gingerbread , and hot chocolate  --  the old Los Robles Sunday supper  --  and then more running and bumpingp271and tumbling on the stairs  --  up and down , up and down ,  --  squeaks , shouts , yells , screams of laughter ... . Bart had grown used to it through the years , and sometimescould concentrate in spite of the noise , but to-night it seemed pandemonium had been let loose . Ile complained fretfullyto Peggy . He could n't stand any more of it , he said ; but she did not think the racket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritable in his old age . She herded the troop to bed , however , a little earlier than usual , and the house quieted down by nine o'clock , with the girls and the baby asleep , and the boys reading iii bed . Peace , quiet . It was like a summer afternoon after a thunderstorm . He took up his manuscript with relief and interest . Peggy looked in at ten . " Coming , dear ? " she inquired . " I think I 'll work to-night , " he told her , half wheeling in his chaiF to look at her as she stood in the doorway . " I wo n't be up much before midnight . You turn out the light . I sha n't need it . " She pouted in a cute little way which she knew had special charm for him . " Aw , come off , muggins , " he protested . " Let the old work go , " she begged . " Is it really something important ? " " Well , it 's . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with The AEgis ; it 's that old novel of mine , the one I was working on last summer I thought I 'd take another whack at it . " His wife came slowly toward him , the pout fading , a troubled look in her eyes . She put her hand on his shoulder and gazed past him to the manuscript where it lay spread out in confusionon the desk . She slid not speak for a minute . Then she kissed him on the hair and chew his head against her heart . " Poor old darling , " she said tenderly . P272THE Dawson Publishing Company occupied an antiquated building in a congested part of the city , an old frame structure , fifty years standing , with fluted columns and heavily corniced windows . The ShoeAEgis , now under a different management , occupied the fifth floor , and its offices ranged up and down a long dark hall which followed at angles a dim , dirty well in the center of the building . Bart usually caught the seven-forty-five from Port Washington , took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and arrived to work at five minutes to nine . His office was first in the line , and he occupied it with his stenographer and assistant , Miss Schwartz . On the frosted glass panel of the door was lettered in black : " Mr. Carter . Art Editor . " The advertising manager , Mr. Bliss , had the room next to his , and beyond , and iii succession along the hall , were the composing room , the reception room , the sanctum of Mr. Max Solomon , the office of the fashion editor , Madame Blum , the editorial rooms , and the office of the editor-in-chief , old Mr. Vonderlies . On the opposite side of the corridor were located the circulation department , the addressing and stencil rooms , the stockroom , the lavatories , etc . While Bart 's official title was " art editor , " his duties had little to do with art and less to do with those of an editor . They consisted in carrying out the orders of Mr. Vonderlies , Madame Blum , and Mr. Bliss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed him , photographs of shoes , shoes of every description , pumps , boots , bootees , slippers , sandals , arctics , rubbers , brogans , leggins , puttees  --  shoes , men 's , women 's , children 's  --  high shoes , low shoes , shoes with high heels , low heels , buckled , strapped , bowed  --  Spring model Style " A , " Fall model Number 23589  --  buttoned , laced , plain .. . P273Every day he sat by Mr. Vonderlies or Madame Blum , occasionally at the desk of Mr. Bliss , and was handed the photographs they wished reproduced in the pages of The Shoe AEgis . It was then his task to mark on the back of each the size of the cut desired , whether or not the background was to be air-brushed , the half-tone to be silhouetted , vignetted , or squared . As the cuts returned from the engravers ' , Bart filed them away in the shallow drawers of large cabinets which ranged the walls of his office . When they were to be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to he blocked on metal , and delivered them next to the composing room , where they were locked up with the type . A second time they went to the electrotyper , who made electros of the forms , deliveredthese to the printer and returned the forms to the composingrooms . When the cuts were " released , " Bart had once more to take charge of them , put them away in the cabinets , and produce them upon demand . " There were thousands of these small , heavily blocked-on-metal half-tones , and Miss Schwartz kept proofs of them pasted in a large scrapbook , with a file number under each , so that they might be readily located . It was dull , deadly uninteresting work . He hated it . He was ashamed of it . He did it acceptably , giving what was expectedof him , nothing more . It was a job  --  a job that gave him a living wage , paid for his insurance , his interest on the mortgages , the food and clothes he and his family ate and wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it he had known on Crosby 's . Whenever he thought of what he had sacrificed in resigning from that magazine , his heart grew heavy . It had appeared imperative to him to have a larger income , at the time ; he had four children , another was expected , and Gill had come to him offering a position which would pay twice the money he was then receiving , with a chance to buy a home , a real one . His brother had seemed an agent of the Lord . Bart had been worried to the point of nervous headaches and indigestion , was discouraged , overworked . Il e and Peggy had been steadily falling behind in their bills ; economize as they might , the debts mounted ; both were sick of their squalid , ugly Bronx neighborhood and the noisy , smelly apartment house in which they had six small crowded rooms . He had been passionatelyanxious for leisure to write . In Gill 's offer , he thought he saw an avenue for escape ; it had meant a home , country for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try his pen . Four years had passed , and he found himself practically in the same situation as before , with worry , debts , discouragement mounting around him ; only now it was infinitely worse . The contacts throughout his days galled and irritated him . He writhed at his association with men and women whose outlook on life had to do with shoes , and whose only conversation dealt with spring styles , fall styles , profits for the shoe dealer , sales policies for the shoe dealer , window displays for the shoe dealer , and the eternal catering to shoe advertisers . Darkest of all was the feeling that hope of something better was growing dimmer day by day . Insurance , interest on the first mortgage , interest on the second , Doc Adam 's account  --  in the hundreds now  --  Butler 's bill , Swanberg 's bill , Wanamaker 's bill , the garage bill , tires for the Dodge , Yacht Club dues , sewer assessment , taxes . No sooner had he disposed of one of these , or paid something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge or some other project involving expense presented itself , demanding new energy and resources to meet it . Try as he would , and he had Peggy 's full cooperation , the bank balance at the end of the month was ever the same ; it seemed impossible to save . He used to remind himself of the first months of their marriage , when lie and Peggy had never failed to put by something for an amusement or a luxury or to meet a coming expense . Were they ever to know a time of peace and security ? He had grown dull to these considerations within the last year or two , and of late had gone about his work mechanically , indifferently : calling up the engraver to rush Job No. 6739 ; sending Miss Schwartz over to Gallagher 's Studio to have a slipper photographed and to wait for the print ; sitting next old Mr. Vonderlies at his desk marking photographs ; listening to Madame Blum describe how she wanted the layout of her fashion page ; telling excitable Hans Freund of the composing room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut holding up the forms would be in at four o'clock ; telephoning the unpleasant news to the electrotyper that , because of a late advertisement , it would be necessary for him and his crew to work all night ; explaining to the ever irate and unsatisfied Max Solomon whyp275the engraving , bills were so high that particular month , whose fault it was that the colors on the cover of the last issue had not registered , why a certain cut wanted by an advertiser could not be found , why a charge for tooling a half-tone had been necessary , why he , Bart , wanted a two-dollar raise for Miss Schwartz , why an artist had been employed to hand letter a title instead of using type , why a copyright line had been omitted , why Miss Schwartz was n't in , why he , Bart , had kept Mr. Solomon waiting when Mr. Solomon had buzzed three times for him . . For two weeks now a happy , exhilarating mood had been upon him . He read over his unfinished novel , correcting as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , and he had induced Miss Schwartz to take the battered manuscript home and make a clean copy of it . His story after the interval which had elapsed since lie laid it aside , pleased hint he was surprised by its excellence ; his heart and mind told hint it was good , just how good he dared not speculate . Always , subconsciously , he thought of Mildred Bransom , wondering how she would judge it , how this phrase or that would impress her , weighing her criticisms as he fancied them . Sometimes he could hear himself arguing with her over some point he feared she might not understand , and once going home on the train he broke into a sudden laugh , realizing he had spoken out loud , had actually been gesturing in imagined speech with her . This happy mood was no new experience . The same kind of elation had come to him before when he had been writing Almaden , or more particularly when toiling over the pages of Quicksilver . It was these moments of exaltation that stirred him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mornings , and whipped him on with ink-stained fingers late into the night . When it deserted him , there was only grim determinationleft to drive him on , forcing him to make his pen travel from line to line , laboriously filling page after page . His present work was a new departure ; he believed it had a romantic , adventurous fling ; the plot was ingenious . He exultedin the accomplishment , and once more seized every spare moment in which to write . His characters and plot were living in his mind , and he was with them there . Some day , he told himself , The Hacienda would be finished , and no publisher would dare refuse it ! It was too exciting , too well done ! " I kilo , Bart ? Is that you ? .... I thought you were going to telephone me one of these days ? Did n't you say --  " He cut in with " Hel-lo , Mildred ! " but his words were confusedin a happy breath . He had been thinking of her so continuouslyin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was startling to hear her voice . It was a moment or two before he could continue . She spoke again , this time with a slight edge to her tone . " Oh , I say , Mildred  --  listen ! " he replied in a burst ; " I meant to call you , believe me , but I wanted to have something in shape to show you . I 've been working like the devil . Oh , indeed I have , ever since we met on the train . " " Splendid . What is it , a short story for us ? " He explained , speaking eagerly , interrupting himself to clap a quick palm over the telephone , and to say hurriedly : " Miss Schwartz , cut out that damn typing , will you ? Please . " Then back once more into the instrument : " 1 ' 111 plugging away at it , have about six chapters completed , but it will he three tines that . It may take me until next summer to finish it . You 've no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirred me all up . " " Ca n't I see what you 've clone ? " " Oh , Mildred , it 's in no condition to show yet ! " " I understand , but I 'd like to know something about it . " " I have n't worked over it enough yet . " " Nonsense , Bart ; do n't be a shrinking violet . It does n't becomeyou . " He laughed . Dear old Mildred ! That was just like her ! " Let me see what you 've done . I sha n't keep it a day . After all , my friend , we must have stories and serials for Crosby 's . " " Oh , this is n't anything you 'd be interested in , " he said quickly . " I ca n't write popular magazine stuff , and you know it . "   " I 'm not so sure . " " Truly , Mildred --  " " Will you let me be the judge ? " " Why , of course , only --  " " Listen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave your office a little early this afternoon , say about five ? Come up and have tea or a cocktail with me before your train time . We can talk better then , and bring your manuscript . " " It 's down at Port --  " " Come anyway , and we can have the cocktail , at least . I 'm on Lexington . . . . " She gave the number . " You 'll find my name just under the bell ; ring three times , will you ? Sometimesit 's a bill collector or a process server , " she laughed , " and I have to protect myself . " " That 'd be lovely , Mildred . I 'd like to . " " At five , then . " " Okay . " " Be prompt , wo n't you ? " " On the minute . " For the rest of the day , he was conscious of a pleasurable excitement . He rehearsed what he should tell her about his story , how much of the plot , and how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on seeing it , well , he 'd bring the manuscriptup the next day A serial ? He 'd never thought ofthat . Well , The Hacienda might make a good serial ; it was that kind of a story . Why not ? There was no reason why he should n't write a good serial . The first piece of fiction he had ever submitted to Crosby 's had been a three-part story . And there was good money in serials ! Gee , if he could get eight or ten thousand dollars for the serial rights of The Hacienda that would take care of both the first and second mortgages and put hint and Peggy on Easy Street . Ile might even feel justified in telling that old curmudgeon , Max Solomon , to go to the devil , and resign from The Shoe AEgis for good and all , devoting himself for the rest of his days to writing . But all this was just crazy dreaming . If Peggy knew , she 'd jolt him out of it .   In any case , there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these hopes until they were in a fair way of beinOn the stroke of five o'clock , he pressed three times the little round brass button above the name " Miss Mildred Bransom , " and an immediate answering " Click  --  click  --  click " permittedhim to enter . A small hallway of white wood , a tall mirror with flanking bronze urns of trailing ivy , a stairway with narrow white banisters and a mahogany rail , Mildred standing at the top of the first short flight , with a welcoming smile and an extended hand . " You are prompt , " she said approvingly . " I 'd ' ve been here before now if I 'd dared . " " Wish I 'd known . Been home since four . " " That would have been a bit early , but I 've been staring into a florist 's window at the corner , waiting for the appointed hour . " " Thinking of flowers for Peggy ? " He flushed and stammered a little as he continued : " I  --  I was marking time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a matter of fact , and  --  and they were to have been for you , only I did n't have the price . " " Nice anyhow , Bart ; I 'll take the will for the deed . " She smiled as she led the way toward the open door of her apartment . The room Bart entered struck him at once as beautiful and gracious . It was not large , but old-fashioned in height and proportions . A coal fire burned in a fireplace of cream-painted brick topped by a thin slab of black oak . Tall curtains of some soft green material hung in generous folds before the windows , shutting out the bleak light of the late winter afternoonand the ugly noises of the street , only a floor below . Here and there a lamp burned warmly . A broad green velvet couch and pillows occupied one wall , and in a corner was a black oak flat-topped desk littered with papers , proofs , and correspondence . The furniture was easy , comfortable ; there were no pictures ; one beautifully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On a low tile tabouret were waiting aP279cocktail shaker , ingredients in bottles , a plate of mixed canapes . " You 've done yourself very well , Mildred , " Bart said glancingabout in admiration , " but T ; ail to see the what-nots of the late lamented King of Bavaria . " " Fancy you remembering them ! " she laughed . " My dear , they all fell to pieces . spent a fortune gluing them together once a month Do sit down . " " You always had an excellent eye , " he said ; " this room is delightful . " " I like it , " she admitted ; " T suppose you always do , the places you furnish yourself . The apartment 's a good deal larger than I need  --  fancy a New Yorker saying that !  --  but it happens to be a fact . There 's just my maid and myself here . You do n't remember Anastasia , do you ? .... Of course not . I brought her back with me from Russia ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted to one another . We only use four rooms , and there are six . " His eye traveled again over the rough-textured ivory-tinted walls , and the effective tall , soft green curtains , so much taller , he noted , than the tops of the windows , and came at length to rest on Mildred herself . She was dressed in silky , lusterless yellow , a simple blouse and pleated skirt , with a shining red patent leather belt hanging loosely about her waist . Effective , the yellow amid so much green , he thought . He had always admired her  --  her slim ankles and wrists , the smooth column of throat on which her head moved so easily . She was not a pretty woman ; handsome , if one stretched for a compliment  --  handsome with good grooming , nicely done hair and nails , and a lovely clear skin . For him , it was in her vivaciousness , the quick flashes of understanding that her attraction lay . He had never particularly thought about Mildred as a woman ; in past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business way . He had always felt tremendously at ease with her , giving and taking as he would a man ; but to-day , for the first time , he was conscious of her feminineness , her charm and pictorial qualities . Ire noticed she had bobbed her hair . Always a pronounced blonde , he now observed that in the lovely mass that clung close to the nape of her white neck there was a tinge of red . It had probably been put there by a wash or a treatment , but it was definitely- becoming . P280She had been busying herself with the cocktails , and lookingup suddenly , she met his steady inspection . " Goodness ! Whatever does the man find that 's wrong about me ! " She glanced at her frock and her slim legs as if to ascertainwhat was amiss , and laughed at his confusion . " Shake these for me , " she bade him , " and let 's get down to business Try those little square ones , I made them myself . . . . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thanks . Now make yourself comfy in that armchair . Here 's luck to the new book . " They raised the glasses and smiled with their eyes over the rims as they drank . " G-god , that 's delicious ! " Bart exclaimed fervently . " Bacardi with just a touch of lemon and grenadine . It 's the imported grenadine that makes it nice . Cigarettes you 'll find right there . Now , tell me what you 've been writing . " He lay back in the easy chair , twisting the stem of the fragile glass he held between thumb and finger , trying to divert his thoughts from the moment to concentrate on his book . It was difficult to recapture the mood of enthusiasm with which he had been thrilling for the past fortnight , difficult even to remember the thought and emotions of the day , or the things he had planned to tell her about The Hacienda . He stumbled and found himself inarticulate . " I 'm describing it very badly , " he said , after a little ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand about the room  --  " and this is so delicious "  --  lie raised the half-emptied glass  --  " that I ca n't give myself a fair break . I live in a cold , hard climate , and this is all too languorous and gracious . " He found an odd kind of encouragement in her silence , and began again , telling her about the old building of the hacienda itself at the foot of the abandoned quicksilver mines , as he remembered it , the adobe walls , the mammoth kitchen in the basement , the empty rooms upstairs , the great reception room with the two mother-of-pearl-faced fireplaces installed sixty , perhaps seventy-five , years ago , the Chinese pagoda  --  a summerhouse , reported to have cost half a million , which had been a . present from a visiting mandarin in appreciation of royal entertainment  --  the gardens , the lake with trailing willows drooping over the water , the swans  --  progeny of some grace/ful-necked ancestors who had delighted the eyes of Spanish senoritas half a century ago  --  the splashing fountains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon silver hits , while vaqueros cleared the way and a soft-eyed girl peered from behind its silk curtains and dreamed of moonlight , the music of a guitar , and the lilting voice of a swaggering hidalgo . .. . " And my mother ran away from all that , " he paused to say , " to marry my father and start a cattle ranch in an arid wilder-ness . " Mildred nodded , her eyes fixed upon his face , and he picked tip his story again , trying to make her see the unfenced reaches of Los Robles , the grazing lands beyond , Guadalutpe Meadows , Rincon de Romas -- the dram the itinerant miner , his father burdened with a wife and two small I aides , had dreamed and made a reality . Digressing , he told her of other great cattle kings in early California history , Miller and Lux , Haggin and Carr , who had established vast domains for their roaming herds , principalities which included mountains and valleys , cities even , and the better part of entire counties . " That Bakersfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make an immense story , one of the most thrilling ever written . Why , one of them  --  I think it was Haggin and Carr  --  hired six hundred men in San Francisco , brought them down secretly on a special train , set them to work , and changed the whole course of Kern River overnight " Well , write it , " Mildred burst in , unable to contain herself ; " my God , Bart , there 's the material at your finger tips and you 're the man of all men qualified to do it . " All her feminineness and sex consciousness were forgotten now ; she was the editor , eager , intense , excited . Thumping one small fist into the palm of her other hand , she sprang up and fell to pacing the room . At one of the front windows , she halted abruptly , drew aside the curtains , and stared out into the cold , blue street . Bart fell silent . He was gratified by the effect of what he had been telling her . Sipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she came presently to stand beside him , a hand upon the black oak mantel , and let her eyes find-with his the charred and glowing coals . When she began to speak , it was with obvious restraint . " You 're a very foolish person , " she said ; " you have a talent for expression quite beyond the ordinary . I think you can write as well and in many cases a great deal better than a number who are basking in the literary limelight to-day . You have this wealth of material ready to hand which you have the foresight to appreciate , and yet you fritter away your time and talents on a shoe magazine and  --  and  --  on commuting .... " Bart laughed . " What would you have me do , my dear ? " " Do ? Do ? " Her impatience broke out once more . " I do n't know what I 'd do , but I 'd do something ! " She paused , collectingherself . " Bart , " she went on again in a quieter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have great potentialities . I do n't know , perhaps it 's only instinct , but I 've learned to depend upon that instinct , and it tells me that you can write if you want to . I think you might go very far with your pen . You 're too modest No , it is n't modesty , " she interrupted herself to say ; " it 's more that you underestimate your ability . You are throwing away your life on a shoe magazine and abunch of thankless , unappreciative children --  " " Oh , come ! " he protested . " I ' ' m speaking impersonally , of course . I know how you must love every hair of their heads , and I know what joy and satisfactionyou get out of them , hut I 'm talking from the point of view of the world . Who cares whether you have children or not , who cares whether you 're married or are n't ? The world  --  the world of art  --  cares only what you contribute to it . Is n't achievement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it perhaps more ? .... I do n't know , I 'm only asking . How many people to-day know whether or not Goethe or Beethoven or Carlyle had children ? Who knows or cares ? It 's what they left in thought and beauty that counts " Mildred , Mildred , " he interrupted , " you 're talking as if I were some sort of a genius ! " " Genius or not , I do n't care ; that 's not the point . The point is that you can write , and by your pen you can win wealth , fame , and contentment . You can be happy and free , if you want to , escape from this awful prison into which life has thrownP283you , rid yourself of these terrible , clanking chains which bind you hand and foot . " The force with which she spoke silenced her . His thoughts spun in a whirlwind Right , was she ? Was it so ? Thetaut strings of the harp within his soul hummed to her voice . .... How he wanted to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if some timepiecewithin him , sounding a warning note , communicated itself to him , he reached for his watch . Instantly he was upon his feet . " Good God , Mildred , it 's quarter to six , and I wanted to catch that six o'clock train . Peggv'lI scalp me ! " " But what about the story , I cart ? " " What story ? " " The Hacienda .. " " Ah , yes .... that . " " When may T see it ? " " It 's not finished . " " Yes , yes , I. know , but I want to read what you 've done . " " Well . . . . ah .... " " Come Saturday and have lunch with me . Can you ? Your office is closed that afternoon . You can spend the afternoon here and read me as much as you 've written . " " All right , that 's fine . " " At one  --  on Saturday ? " " At one , I 'll be here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got me all boiled up ! It 's rotten to have to rush away like this  --  but you know ! Peggy 'll scalp me .... " He missed the six o'clock train , and the next left half an hour later . He walked into his home at twenty-five minutes past seven . Peggy and the children were at the table , finishing the dessert . Apologizing and explaining he had been detained at the office , he sat down at his place . Peggy , he saw , was annoyed . Kate backed open the swing door from the pantry , her hands full , to set his coffee and his dinner plate before him with two indifferent thumps . Even the children understood he was out of favor .   He made an effort . " I 'm truly sorry , Peggy ; I just could n't get away . Solomon came in , wanted me to get some photographs over to the engravers ' at the last moment . " She was in one of her prim , baffling moods , determined to say nothing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry with him . She avoided addressinghim , giving her whole attention to the children , asking the boys questions about their geography and history lessons , explaining the spectrum in detail to all the children and telling them what colors composed it . To-night Bart was indifferent to her coldness . He was still under the spell of Mildred Bransom 's words , and his mind was upon his book . He had been thinking about it coming down on the train , determined he would work at it as never before , planning how to develop his characters , strengthen its plot . He was on fire to begin . All his creative instinct was on tiptoe . He felt he could write , thousands and thousands of words , and write at his best . I f Peggy was sore at him , it was too bad . He really did not care whether she was angry with him or not ; he wanted to go to his study and work ; he wanted to write ! And write he did , page after page after page , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the pen grew dry and made meaningless scratches at the paper because he would not pause long enough to clip the point in the well . Upstairs , feet pounded ; he heard the bang of a falling chair , there was a splintering smash of some heavier object , the baby awoke with a wail . He was not disturbed . Words and sentences flowed in a stream ; it was exciting to record them . Toward ten o'clock , Kate returned from her visit to the Hollow , stamping her feet on the back porch , banging shut the storm door to the kitchen entrance , securing it with its rattling chain , as was her custom . Mounting heavily , she ascended the rear stairs . The tub was being filled in the bathroom ; he could hear the plunge of water from the faucets . The house grew cold ; his forgotten cigarette burned the edge of the desk , raisinga smell of scorched varnish . Once he thought he heard Peggy calling . He wrote on  --  he was in his big scene  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped . From sheer exhaustion his pen dropped at length from his cramped , stained fingers . He leaned forward , elbows on the desk , burying his face in his hands , and remained so for a long time , resting from his efforts , drawing a deep breath now and then , waiting until normalcy returned . lie rose stiffly then , straightening his aching heck , and glancing at the clock saw , with surprise and satisfaction , it was nearly one o'clock . For a moment or two he still lingered , standing before his desk , looking at the inky , scratched pages of his manuscript , flicking over one or two of them , reviewing what he had written . " If she does n't think that 's good , " he said under his breath , " I 'm just cuckoo , and I might as well stick at being the art editor of a shoe magazine . " After he had tiptoed upstairs , he remembered he had forgotten the furnace and tiptoed clown again , finding his way by the back stairs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dying embers . Once more above , he undressed by the light from the bathroomflooding the hall , extinguished this , and wearily but happily got into bed . Tired though he was , he could not find sleep at once . His story , with its plot and characters , went around and around in his brain . He lay on his back , hands clasped across his breast , and gave himself up to them , staring into the blackness above . A sound startled him . " Peggy ? " He was on his elbow in a moment , trying to make out her face across the space which separated their beds . He had no answer , but something told him the noise had come from her . He got out of bed , bent over her , and gently touched hershoulder . , , Peggy ? , , He knew then she was awake and had been crying . " Dearest , dearest , " he implored , " what is it ? . What 's the matter ? " He was on his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to see her face in the darkness . " What is it , darling ? ' he entreated . ' Fell Bart ForGod 's sake , sweetheart , tell me what 's troubling you ? " He put out his hand and touched her face . It was wet with tears . With a jerk he pulled back the bed covers and got in beside her , his arms about her , murmuring loving phrases , petting her . He had forgotten about his lateness at dinner ; he could not imagine what it was that distressed her . Ile had it finally  --  a long , unhappy tale of how she had gone clown to the corner with the children to wait for him about the time his train was due , because that was the way she did when they were first married and he used to walk up the Avenue from the office to meet her , and she and the children had waited and waited for him there in the cold , and when he had n't been on his usual train , they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been on that , they had come home and found Kate in one of her tantrums because she had been kept waiting , and then one word led to another , and finally Kate said she would n't stay another day , and Peggy did n't know whether she was quitting in the morning or not . And it had all been because he had n't telephoned ! Why had n't he telephoned ? What was a telephone for ? It was so easy to telephone ! Just say " I 'll be home a little late to-night , dear , " because that would have saved everybody 's feelings . It was the only decent thing to have done , anyhow . It had been a lovely dinner , and all spoiled , and so naturally he had n't said a word about it , and she had made those peas , cooked with bacon , he always liked so much ... . And then what had he done ? Shut himself up in his stupid old study without a word to say to any of them , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-night , not even when she had called and called ! What kind of a life did he think she lived , anyway ? It was just one petty detail after another , cooking and rinsing diapers and making beds , mending and darning , working , working , working from morning until night just so the house would look pretty and be in order , and the children clean and well behaved , so that when he came home he 'd find something pleasant to come home to , and if he did n't appreciate how much work there was to do , she 'd like him to try it for one day  --  just for one day  --  and if he did n't love her any more she might just as well take the children and go back to the ranch , because she only did it for him , and there was no sense in her slaving herself to death if he did n't care anything about his home , his children , or herself ... . P287She was crying now , her anger passed . Her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and , physically tired though he was , he thrilled to the softness and to him , he told her how he loved her , how dear and sweet she was , and how he would willingly cut off his right hand rather than have her unhappy for a single minute . Around and about them spread the cold darkness of the night , with the icy breath of out of doors stirring the curtainsat the wide flung window . In their rooms close at hand , their children lay safely asleep , and from the one immediately adjoining , Kate 's guttural breathing rose aid fell rhythmically . Warm and happy and restored to peace once more , they clung together beneath the covers , arms entwined , breast to breast , and longing rose like a white hot flame in each of their hearts . hugging , straining , their breath quickening , they yearned for one another , battling within themselves the ageoldstruggle between duty and desire . And into Bart 's ear came Peggy 's soft whisper : " I 'll have another baby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to clutch him by the throat ; it was as if a giant hand had grasped him there . He swallowed , opening his eyes , staring into the night . " Now  --  now , " he said to himself , " now 's the time to.think  --  now 's the time to weigh consequences . . . . not later .... " Thoughts , swift , flashing : his novel , Mildred , serial rights , debts , hopes , future , Eva Ann , himself , Peggy , the children . . . . " Now  --  vow is the time to weigh consequences . . . . not later ! " He made himself see a picture : Peggy coming to him  --  here in their bedroom or down there in the study  --  gazing at him with a frightened starry , swimming look , and telling him , perhaps with a hand of sympathy on his arm , thinking only of what the unpleasant news was to mean to him , another baby was on the way ! He gulped , pushing her away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  we must n't , we ca n't ! That 's all there is about it ! We 're just unlucky . We ca n't have another baby ! . . Oh , help me , Peg ; gee whilikens , you know I want you ! " She lay passively for a little , and then , with all the warmth of arms and body , she drew him to her . He lay against her , panting , eyes fiercely shut , teeth clenched , hands knotted into fists . " The Hacienda ! " he thought ; " The Hacienda ! " In his mind , the characters of his story rose before him ; they seemed to be looking at him reproachfully , like people drowning . He thought of what it would mean to abandon them . Friends ,  --  confident , trusting loyal friends  --  deserted ! He thought of the curling pages of his manuscript of Quicksilver in the red flames of the furnace . He groaned and sank his teeth into his lip . Catching Peggy harshly by the shoulder , he pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . We 're going crazy ! Damn it ! You 'll regret this like anything to-morrow morning . We do n't dare go through with it . Peggy darling , we love each other , and God intended we should enjoy each other . This kind of businessca n't go on for the rest of our lives ' ! Ca n't you see that ? It 's just killing us both ! . . . . Oh , my God , Peg , I want you so .... " Once more he fought with himself . " Peg , Peg , " he cried ill anguish , " why , why wo n't you let me ask Doc Adams to talk to you ? Why wo n't you listen to reason and follow his advice ? Just let him talk to you for half an hour .... " He stopped . At once he felt a cold wind blowing between them . He could feel Peggy 's head next his own upon the pillow gently and firmly shaking . He knew her lips were set . She moved away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very well , " he said quietly ; " if you wo n't , you wo n't . I do n't know what 's to become of us Good-night , dear ; I 'll go back to bed . " He reached out with his lips in the dark and found her ear , a corner of her cheek . He kissed and left her . P289THE table was daintily set and stood near the two front windows . It was round , a lace tablecloth covered it , and Anastasia came in and placed a great bawl of violets in its center . A fire burned in the coal grate ; outside the street was bathed in sparklingwinter sunshine . The tall green curtains had been pushed back , and daylight filtered through diaphanous sheer ones of a more delicate green next the casement , and the ivory walls and contents of the room were tinged with emerald tints . Bart and Mildred sat in easy chairs before the fire , finishing their cocktails . " Mighty pleasant , " he said , setting his emptied glass on the tile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all week to this afternoon . " " I 've been looking forward to it , too , " Mildred admitted . " Did you lose your scalp the other night , as you feared ? " " Oh , yes , but I did n't mind . I was too thoroughly excited about the marvelous things you had been telling me , and I was crazy to get to work . " " And did you ? " " You bet ; till midnight and later . I 've been getting up every morning at five , freezing to death , incidentally , but putting in a couple of hours before train time . I 've even been doing a little now and then down at the office . " " Fine work , Bart ; I 'm glad 1 stirred you up . You brought the manuscript with you ? " " I have it over there with my hat and coat . " " We 'll get at it directly after lunch . You 'll read it ? " " If you like . " " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peggy wo n't expect me until the usual weekday time . "  | " I 've been thinking so much about you and your work since you were here . " " I lave you ? Well , I 've been thinking a lot about it , too . Thanks to you . " " You 've nothing to thank me for . " " Oh , have n't I ? Mildred  --  I think I 've been happier these past three weeks than I 've been since . . . . oh , I ca n't remember . A long time , anyway . " " Why , are n't you happy , Bart ? I thought you andPeggy " Oh , we are . It is n't that . It 's this damned groove I 'm in " Hole , you mean . " " Perhaps . My life 's dull as dish water . It 's this interest in writing that 's suddenly given me pep . " " Let me fill your glass . I wo n't say dividend ! How I hate big , fat brokers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do you often dine with big , fat brokers ? " He eyed her speculatively . " Not if I can help it . " She filled his glass and her own . " If you mean , " she went on , " do I allow big , fat brokers to take me out to dinner , I can assure you I do n't . If I could find entertainment in that sort of thing , I 'd go in a minute . But I do ( line out occasionally with friends , married folk , understand , and it 's when my host comes up to me , offering to refillmy glass , and says , ' I lave a little dividend ? ' that I shudder . Well , cone to lunch . ' Stasia 's glaring at me . I suppose things are spoiling in the oven . Sit there , will you , Bart ? " The table , the room , the prospect of luncheon , the companionship , all were charming . A feeling of exhilaration , of well-being came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick , savory soup as they were set before him . Chianti was served from a straw-cased bottle in thin green-tinted wineglasses . All the glassware on the table was green . He admired it , and Mildred told him she had bought it at Wanamaker 's . " You always make me talk about myself , " he said , after a while ; " you never say a word about yourself or what you are doing these days , I mean of special importance . " " What would you like to know ? "   " Probably the things you would n't care to tell me . " " I do n't believe you 'd find even those interesting . " " Try it . " " Well , would you be interested to know that I 've just learned my mother 's probably dying ? " " Oh , Mildred ! I 'm sorry ! " " You need n't be . She 's past seventy , and as long as she does n't suffer , I sha n't worry . You see , she 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives with my married sister in Mansfield , Ohio . Ever been in Mansfield , Ohio ? " " No . " " Then , do n't go . " " I did n't know you had a mother , ) Mildred . " " Oh , yes , I 'm like everybody else . M ii erva , Adam , and Eve are the exceptions , I believe . Can you think of any others ? " He asked about Crosby 's ; it always interested hint to hear bits of gossip from the old organization . " Do n't suppose . I ' d know a single one of the staff now , " he observed . " You remember Pat Costello ? Used to be in the advertising department ? He married that pretty Patterson girl in the front office . " " And Mr. Crosby ? " " About the same , although he seems lost in our new offices . You have n't seen them ? Oh , you must ; we 're sumptuous . " He thought of the gloomy halls , and the dingy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke in with : " Do n't be mooning over what 's past and gone . You did what you thought was right at the time . I suppose Mr. Crosby resents it to this day . I 'll admit it would have been pleasant if you 'd stayed . " " We 'd have been seeing each other every clay , probably fighting over articles or stories and editorial policies . " " I 'm not so sure . We never used to disagree . " There was something in her tone that made hint look up . She was absently stirring her empty bouillon cup with a spoon . " My dear , " he said quickly , " of course we never used to disagree , and , please God , we 'll be of the same mind about this story of mine . " " Then you do think it 's good ? "   " I did n't say that . " " But you like it ? " He considered , hesitating . " Truly , I ca n't tell . I 'm terribly interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romantic and has plenty of action and speed . My characters seem very much alive to me . That 's all I can say . " . A marvelous-looking dish appeared , made of stewed chicken , pink carrots , onions , round potatoes , and half-a-dozen other kinds of vegetables , submerged in thin , rich brown gravy . " One of ' Stasia 's recipes . Her mother used it . They came from Elizavetgrad . She 's had a perfectly amazing history . Some day I 'll have to tell you about her . My God , if she could write ! " The fire settled with a tiny crash in the grate , and Mildred motioned to him , as he moved , not to replenish it . The room was warm , the day scintillating , the wine pleasant , the food delicious . Crackers and ripe cheese appeared , with coffee and a chaste decanter containing a colorless liquid . " Vodka , " Mildred enlightened him , grasping the bottle by its thin neck . " Have you ever tasted it ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must n't sip it . Toss it off ; that 's the proper way . Try it , I do n't believe you 'll like it . I have it for the coffee . Coffee without vodka is vile . " He tipped a small glassful clown his throat and pronounced it excellent . " You should have waited until after you 'd finished your coffee ; I 'm afraid it will spoil it . " " Marvelous , " he said , meaning the hour , the luncheon , and her company . She understood . " You have no idea how much I 'm alone , " she told him , looking thoughtfully over the rim of the coffee cup at her lips . " I sit here night after night , and not a soul comes in , " she continued . " Saturdays and Sundays are hell . I have to think up things to do to distract myself . I do n't mind weekday nights so much . ' Stasia always has a nice dinner for me ; she knows just what I can eat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire , if there is one , and generally have a magazine or two to lookp293through to see what a deadly rival is doing . I have manuscripts to read too . " " Do you still have to plow through all the trash that comes in ? " " Oh , no . We have two regular readers now , but I have to decide what we 're going to bury and what we are n't . Of course , the final decision rests with Mr. ( ' rushy . Then , usually I have work I ca n't very well do in the office . So many interruptions , you know . At best , it 's lonesome . Sometimes I threaten to get a woman friend to conic its here with sue . " " Why do n't you ? " " Brrrr-rr ! I 'm afraid ; I 'd rather be lonely than bored . " " How is - it you never married , Mildred ? " He asked the question casually , hut immediately she flushed to the eyebrows , warns color flooding her face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time , " she said , finger tips pressed to either cheek . " How is it I 've never married ? " she repeated , when she had collected herself . " Well , I 'll tell you . I 've always been in love with the wrong man . It was Will Ohrstrom for a long time , and then I had an affair with a Russian officer  --  the one I told you about  --  in a rather feeble attempt to get over my infatuation with Will , and then .... after that .... after that , there was you . " " Me ! " His eyes flashed to her face . " Oh , years and years ago . I sort of fell for you from the very beginning . I remember it began the day I rented my little apartment to you and Peggy . I fancy it was the romance the two of you represented , and your mad infatuation with her that appealed to me at first . After I sailed I found myself thinking about you a lot , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back at the office , there was you again . I 'm afraid I had a terrible case on you for a while  --  and , oh , was n't 1 jealous of Peggy ! You never suspected of course , and I was in terror you 'd find out . I remember one day you were sick , and telephoned you were going to stay in bed and that Peggy would look after you .... My dear , I had to go home too , I got crying so .... " " Mildred ! "   " Oh , I 'm all over it now , and you may tell Peggy all about it , if you want to . I rather think she suspected . I caught her looking at me awfully funnily one day when she came down to the office to keep an appointment with you . I have n't an idea how she guessed , but women do n't need to be told such things . You may tell her all about it now , if you want to . There have been a number since ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm an awful fool , Bart . I have a regular high-school girl 's crush right this minute on a young man in our advertising department . I do n't even know his name , and all he does is to lift his hat and bow to me when we meet in the hall or elevator , and blush the way I did a moment ago , because he knows I 'm the managing editor Bart , I 'll have just a taste of that vodka . " He filled the tiny green glass she held towards him . " Thanks . Fill your own I 'm an awful fool . He has one of those Arrow collar faces and big square shoulders . Oh , I 'm sure he was a football player at Yale ! " Come , sit over here by the fire , " she continued in a moment . " There 's no heat in it , but it 's something to look at . Sit there where the light will come over your shoulder when you read . We must n't forget the book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . " But they did forget it . Their talk ran on from one subject to another  --  on and on and on . Twice they spoke of the novel , and Bart even got so far as to bring the binder that held the manuscript . But for the rest of the afternoon , he sat with it unopened on his knees . They spoke of books and writers and themselves ; they spoke of publishers and magazines and themselves ; they spoke of things and people and themselves . The afternoon fled at a gallop . It was a shock suddenly to discover it was growing dark and that a blue dusk filled the street . Bart was astonished in glancing at his watch to find it close to five . He rose to his feet . " In God 's name , " he exclaimed earnestly , " what has happened to the time ? I 'd ' ve sworn , Mildred , it was not more thanp295three ! My dear , the afternoon 's been perfectly wonderful . " He took her hand and patted it affectionately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry about the story , " he went on , " but I would n't have missed a word of our talk . Forgive me for saying it again , but it 's been simply wonderful . " She looked soberly into his eyes , her hand clinging to his , and then she smiled . It was a slow smile but a happy one . " I 'll read it to-night and write you about it before I go to bed . " " Oh , do n't do that . 1 should n't get your letter until Monday . Better send it to the office , for , if it goes to fort , T sha n't have it until Monday night , and , of course , I 'm crazy to know what you think . And you will be truthful , wo n't you , Mildred ? You wo n't let our friendship bias you in its favor , will you ? Promise me , Mildred . I 'm counting on you .

" " Ca n't we do it again ? " " That 's up to you . I have no home ties . " " Well , I must come to see you . It 's been  --  oh , I do n't know  --  it 's just been heaven  --  the lunch , the afternoon , you ! You do n't know what all this peace and quiet and beauty and understandingmean to me .

" Simply and unaffectedly , he put his arm about her shoulders and kissed her . " Good-bye , my dear , " he said again , catching up overcoat and hat ; " whatever you tell me , be honest . " He ran down the stairs , threw open the door below , and hurriedoff in the direction of the subway . " Solomon kept me all afternoon , " he said to Peggy as he flourished his napkin and sat down at the dinner table later that same evening . He was in the gayest of spirits .

I 'll just have coffee and cake and ice cream . We 've been to nearly all the others ' houses , and Leelee phoned to-day to say she could n't have us at her house next week because .... " Mildred 's letter : " Bart dear ! I think you 've written a capital story . It moves , it has plenty of action , you have captured that ephemeralp298something romance . I congratulate you . If you go on as you 've begun , I am certain Mr. Crosby will want it . Do n't make it too long  --  that 's all I urge . One or two points I 'd like to discuss with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you ? " As he read the words , he realized how much store he had set upon her opinion . He reached with a hand that trembled a little for the bulky telephone directory , looked up Crosby 's new number , and in a few moments had its managing editor on the line . " I 'm so thrilled , Mildred , I do n't know what to do ! You do like it , do n't you ? You 're not kidding me ? " " I like it more than I dared allow myself to say in that letter . Oh , Bart , I like it so much I 'm in terror for fear you 'll spoil it ! It 's splendid ! If you 'll only keep going ! That 's what I want to see you about . " " When shall it be ? " " Well , I do n't know .... " " How about this afternoon ? " " All right with me . Come early , can you ? " " A little after four ? I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four-thirty train . " " Vine ! I 'll do the same ! " They laughed at their scheming . On his way to the appointment , he found himself smiling broadly at his fellow subway passengers , and when he took Mildred 's hand at the top of the short flight from the street door , it was all he could do to keep from putting his arms about her . Dear Mildred ! She certainly was good She was just wonderful ! The purring , smiling fire again , the drawn green curtains , the tile tabouret with the silver shaker and fragile green-tinted glasses , little crackers this time covered with melted cheese . " Perfect , Mildred ! I 've been excited all day over the prospect of coming up . I love it . And you honestly like the Magnum Opus ? " P299She told him again how well she liked it , wanted at once to know how he proposed to finish it . When he told her , she clapped her hands like a child , then impulsively reached out to take hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a current began to flow between them through the contact  --  a current , growing swifter and stronger as their fingers continued to cling together . Bart had to look away . He was fully conscious of her now , conscious of her femininity , warmth , and personality , of how much he was drawn t o her . " I 'll work , " he said ; " ill do my danmedest . " He let go her hands , looked into the fire , his face frowning . In the ensuing silence , the current th ; it had flowed between them began to flow again . A feeling of repose , of relaxation and peace came to hint ; he could not remember having experienced anything quite like it before . Just to he there  --  just to he sitting near her -- just to be able to look at her if he wished  --  seemed at the moment completely to satisfy him . The silence lengthened ; neither was disposed to break it . At last , both stirred simultaneously , Bart to reach for a cigarette , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said with a long breath , " here 's to The Hacienda . " He rose to touch her glass with his . They discussed then the length of the story , where it should be broken into installments , when it could be finished . " June , if I work hard , " he told her . " That would be too late for fall publication . I 'll run it in the spring . " " My dear , do you really think .... ? " " I 'll tell you , Bart , I thought I 'd ask Mr. Crosby to read it without saying who wrote it . He may be prejudiced against you , I do n't know . But , oh , I 'm certain he 's going to like it . It 's a corking good story ! " Again that leap of current . It was like electricity . Bart had a momentary giddiness ; the blood beat up into his neck , and he felt it throbbing in his temples . I le reached for a chair back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 1 guess I 'd better be going . " " Yes , " she said . He offered his hand , and when he had her fingers , held them a moment . Ile dared not look at her . Picking up hat and coat , he stood before the door . " Well , " he said again , " I 'll be on my way . I 'm going to work very hard ; like blazes . I 'll let you know how I 'm getting along . " " Yes , do , " she said ; " I 'll be interested . " he laid his hand on the door knob . " See you sometime soon , eh ? " He shot her a quick interrogatingglance . " Ring me up , " she said . " All right ; I 'll do that .... " Still he hesitated . He felt it was more than he could do to leave that room , that fire ! He wrenched open the door . " Good-bye , " he said . He walked out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tread , he stopped and looked up at her as she stood in the apartment doorway . She rested there with her head against the framework , the finger tips of one hand touching her cheek , the emerald tints of the room behind her making a soft , warm halo about her head . He looked a long moment , then waved his hat and went down the stairs without speaking . On the glaringly lighted suburban train hound for Port Washington , he found a seat next the window . His manuscript in its canvas-covered binder was tucked in beside him ; an eveningpaper lay in his gloved hand . Ile was tempted to look at neither . He felt curiously composed . His thoughts were of Mildred  --  of himself . Nothing very definite . His mind lingered on the room with the tall green curtains , the red embers in the grate , the tile tabouret with the shaker and glasses , and dwelt on the girlish figure which moved before and about them . He shrank from analysis . If he was conscious of anything at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the woman were not for him . He must not go there again ; the friendship , so pleasant , companionable , and stimulating , must end . It was over ; he was done with it . He felt like a man who had been enjoying the sunshine and had been ordered back to the house . The sunshine was not good for him . All the excitement of the past few weeksp301was gone . His , interest in his work , in continuing with The Hacienda , was dead . He had no desire to write another line . Depression rode him in its place . He must go on in the same old rut , he thought darkly : his home , where he was never at peace . Solomon , the Five Hundred Club , insurance premiums , mortgage interest , debts , worry . There was no beauty anywhere . It was snowing when he reached fort Washington . Feathery white flakes were falling . All the ugliness of the icy , dirty , sooty ground , usually revealed by station , street , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread itself through the night . A taxi driver spoke to him , offering a remaining seat in a car bound in the direction of his hone , but Bart preferred to walk . He chose a way by back streets , kicking the soft snow before him as he trudged along , lifting his face now and then to the delicate caress of the silently falling flakes . Home seemed an unfamiliar place to which to come . It was warm within the house . The children all rushed at him to be kissed , the smaller ones clasping him about the knees . Peggy was hurrying back and forth between kitchen and dining room , setting the last of the table , the pantry door flopping to and fro at each of her hurried passages . She called cheerfully to him and set the butter dish where it belonged . He was too weary to go upstairs to wash ; he sat down at the table and waited for the meal to be ready . " Tired , old man ? " she asked solicitously , and kissed him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . Daddy  --  Daddy  --  Daddy -- -blaa-bla-bla-bla  --  ding , ding , ding  --  bang , ' bang , bang  --  bzzzzzzzzzz " Hello , Johnny , what you got there ? " " Oh , it 's a scooter a guy made at school . " " I see .... " Bang , bang , bang  --  blaa-bla-bla-bla-hla  --  bzzzzzzzzzz " Din-ncr , children ! Come on , all of you . Put that away , Johnny Dan , did you hear Mother ? " They were irrepressible with chatter  --  the boys about the new fall of snow , about school and friends , and tobogganing over in the Racket Estates ; the girls about their teacher , a French song they were learning , a fairy play they were rehearsing , about wands and gold-paper stars , and a dead bird found in the snow ; Peggy about what the children ate and how they ate it , about Johnny 's rubber boots , and for him to try to remember where he had left them , about colored tissue paper which would do just as well for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the table , his eyes traveling from face to face . They seemed like strangers to him , people who did not belong to him nor he to them , queer folk with queer ideas . He drank his coffee and left them to their chocolate pudding , while Peggy scolded them to pass each other the cream and sugar , and to look out for one another 's wants . At his desk in the study Bart opened his manuscript and read over the last chapter he had written . When he had finished , he picked up his pen and began slowly to continue . It was the old laborious task of adding word to word , sentence to sentence . Joy was gone ; facility of expression had deserted him . Betweenhis eyes and the white page came the vision of the room with the tall , green curtains , the fire snickering in the grate , the tabouret , the woman of the fair hair with its tinge of red who understood . . . . that was it , who understood ... . " Hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of his penholder . He stared at a row of books on the opposite wall for idle minutes . A pounding overhead . He heard a squeal of delight from the girls and Peggy 's warning . " I 'll punish you , children , if you wake the baby ! " Ile shook himself , tried to concentrate . Presently the thought came to him that some clay Mildred would read what he wrote . She was depending on this story , she wanted it for a serial , a serial in the spring of 1921 . His hand began to move faster , words commenced to form themselves . Yes , he must write his best . He might not write to her , but he could write for her ! Absorbed , he was hardly conscious of Peggy 's entrance . She sat down in an armchair near the light and began fussing , makingsomething . There was a good deal of rustling going on ; vaguely he was aware it was the paper fairy costumes . She said : " I hope this does n't disturb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so cold and lonesome to-night . " He heard her ; he did not hear her . He went on writing . His thoughts were flowing in order now , the words marshaling themselves , falling dutifully in line , P303forming rank upon rank , marching down the white page . Coming to the end of a chapter , he drew a line , threw down his pen , and covered his face with his hands as he always did when spent . " I do n't see why you tire yourself so , dearest , with all this night work when you use up so much of your energy during the day , " Peggy was saying . " Is all this writing truly necessary , Bart ? We , the children and i , sec so little of you . Seems to me I 'm always shushing them with ' Quiet , children , Daddy 's trying to work . ' Heavenly day , Bart , children are children , and they have to play , and when you 're working like this , you scowl at them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do . I miss my old chum , dearest . I miss your playing with ... . " I want to talk to you , because I 've been thinking that maybewe are n't fair to you in this house , and perhaps I am least of all . You do n't get the quiet and the relaxation you should , and I 've decided on a change . " I 've decided on it for two reasons , because one 's for your comfort , and the other 's for . . . . well , it 's just to safeguard us from doing anything so crazy as we came near doing last Saturday night . Dearest , how right and wise and good you were ! I 've been thinking about it ever since , and I went over to church this afternoon and offered up a prayer of thanksgiving . I reckon I just lost my head , Bart , but you  --  you were simply marvelous . Oh , my dear , I 'm so grateful , because I might be out of my senses with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wits about you ! " Of course , it may happen again . I realize that you and I have a problem , and I understand that as well as you do . Oh , I 've been praying about it ... . " Now , this is the safeguard I 've thought of : I 'm going to put the baby iii with Piney  --  he 's quite old enough now for him to sleep in there , and it will be a fine , developing thing for her to look after him at night  --  and I 'm taking Margaret in with me , and I 've moved your bed into the nursery " " You 've moved what ? " " Now , listen , Bart , do n't go off half-cocked until you 've heard me out , because it 's the only safe thing for us to do . We must n't have another baby . You and I have agreed about that , because it would be a calamity just now . We must n't thinkp304of another for several years , because I doubt if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps it would n't ; that 's neither here nor there . The point is , we simply can not afford to have another child . Our Heavenly Father alone knows how we 're ever going to take care of the five we have . " Now , listen ! Do n't go scowling at me ! " We must do something to prevent our doing what might have happened night before last . Oh , I know I was just as bad about it as you ! I 'll take all the blame , if you think I should . I 'll admit sometimes I  --  I  --  well , I lose control of myself , and I 've just got to have a check  --  a check on me as well as on you , and so I thought of this plan of taking Margaret in with me . I have her bed right next to mine , and I 've moved you  --  everything  --  intoDickey 's room . Oh , my dear , you have no idea how comfortable you 're going to be in there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can see you 're not a bit happy about this arrangement , but help me , darling , because I need your help . Try this plan for a few weeks and see how you like it Oh , I know what you 're thinking , but I 'm nearly beside myself , because I do n't know what else to do ! " Dearest , do n't be mad at me ! You love me , and you know I love you , and I 'm doing this as much for your sake as mine . You helped me keep my bearings last Saturday night , and I want to help us both keep our bearings from now on , because when l think what might have happened .... ! You 'll thank me some day . You 'll call down I leaven 's blessing upon me . " She was on her knees before him , her hands clasping his forearms , her wide dark eyes rich with tears . " Help me , dearest , " she urged . " Do n't be mad at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you do n't like it , I 'll move everything back ; I promise you . " Oh , dearest , dearest , I do n't want another baby . I must n't have another baby Help me , wo n't you ? " P305ON FRIDAY , February 6 , 1020 , a blizzard struck New York City . The snow was falling when lt ; irt went in on the train that morning , and it fell in fierce , slanting , wind-driven lines all day . People stood in the windows of their offices and looked out at the blundering motor cars , the laboring truck horses , and the rubber-covered policemen at the crossings , white with snow . By noon , the street cars were withdrawn , their tracks obliterated . A snow plow was stalled on the east side of Union Square . Bart , observing the swirling flakes , thought only of his childrenand of the fun the heavy fall would mean to them , but when he left the Gotham House a little before his time to take his usual train , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He fought his way along the streets , ankle-deep , often knee-deep in the drifts , head and shoulders bent to the furious on-rush , seeing his way with difficulty . The subway trains were jammed , the station platforms wet with tracks from dripping garments . He found himself presently one of several hundred homeward-bound passengers congregatedbefore the closed iron gates of the Long Island trains in the depot , staring perplexedly at a sign fixed to the grilling which read : " Train service to Long Island has been temporarilydiscontinued on account of the storm . " With a half-formed intention of telephoning Peggy and explaining his predicament , he crossed the street , via the subway , passing through the tunnel beneath the tracks , and came up into the Pennsylvania Hotel on the east side of the street . It then occurred to him it would be an excellent idea to spend the night at the hotel so as not to lose his evening 's work . But he found that the telephone lines to Port Washington were down , and further , that there was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to the Martinique , a block away , and braving the snow once more , he forged his way thither and was fortunate in obtaining the last available accommodation . The Martinique was crowded with stormbound travelers like himself . The long , spacious foyer which stretched through the building from one street to another was filled with people , sittingor standing , trying to while away the time , smoking , readingnewspapers , talking or idly staring at the slowly milling throng . Having secured his room , Bart again plunged out into the storm , found a modest restaurant close by , had something to eat , and shortly was back and upstairs in his cheerless quarters with his manuscript open before him . He tried once more to telephone Peggy , and left word to be called as soon as the line was clear . " Oh , she 's bound to understand what 's keeping me , " he assuredhimself , dismissing the worry and turning his attention to his work . But he had hardly settled to it , before a thought obtruded . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It returned . He shook himself free of it . It came back . He kept seeing Mildred Bransom 's face smiling at him . " Oh , it is n't probable , " he said , aloud : " it is n't a bit likely . " He tapped his teeth with the end of his pen . " There is n't a chance in a thousand , " he argued , addressing the somber wall paper . Still , where would she be on such a night ? " Perhaps she 'll be having a friend or two in for dinner . " Yet that was hardly likely . She had said she was much alone . He recalled his thoughts on the train after the last time he had seen her . " Yes , " he said ; " of course . . . . I ought n't to . " ' A picture rose before him of the room with the tall green curtains , the cheerful fire , the two chairs pulled up before it , Mildred talking  --  talking  --  talking on such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white . . . . He must n't let himself think of such visions ! His eyes traveled to the wall telephone . He could at least speak to her , tell her he was down at the Martinique , workin ! .. .  |p307No  , it would be the height of folly ! Still .... He pulled himself to his feet , and , tinder " B , " ran his eye down the columns of names in the telephone directory . Probably he would n't be able to get her . I f the Long Island lines were down ... . Suddenly and without trouble he was talking to her . After he had hung up the receiver , his hand clung to it . He leaned his head against the door jamb , his eyes closed a moment . Then he went back to the table where lay his work and sat down heavily in his chair . He had told her about the train service , that he was in the city for the night  --  at the Martinique  --  and then , like a crazy fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm and coming out to see her . And then ... . Ah , then , when that happy catch in her voice betrayed her pleasure at the prospect , he  --  still like a crazy fool !  --  had told her he thought he had better not come . And then  --  God ! that change in her tone ! He had tried to ignore it , talked lightly , had told her he was hard at work on his book , and she had said .... had said . . . . What did it matter what she had said ! She had always been so decent to him , so kind , so  --  so sympathetic , so wonderfully understanding ! She was alone , probablylonesome , perhaps apprehensive . It would cheer her up a lot if he went . They 'd be sure to have a great evening together talking ... . He would go ! He would n't go ! .... It was n't safe . He knew it was n't . He turned back to his manuscript , scowling at the page , rereadingwhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later he was staring at the ugly arabesques in the somber wall paper . Again he saw the room with the drawn green curtains , the fire lit , the soft lamps burning , and he could hear the swish-swish of the snow against the windows .. " Hell ! " he said through locked teeth.  | He flung down his pen and went to the telephone on the wall . " I 'm coming , " he told her brusquely . " It will take me a little while to get there . I 'll take the El ' to Fifty-ninth and scramble across town as best I can . There is n't a thing moving . " With eager fingers and a fierce joy of excitement , he buttonedhimself to the neck into his overcoat , pulled down his hat over his eyes , caught up his gloves , and went out , banging and locking his room door behind him . It was just as he had pictured it when , spent and short of breath from fighting the wind and the stinging scud , he found himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtains were drawn , shutting out the storm and the night , the fire was burning , the easy chairs were drawn up before it , Mildred herself , gay , laughing , was delighted to welcome him , giving him the impression that she too shared his feeling that this particular visit was an adventure . She carried his hat and overcoat to some inner room where they could drip and dry out . He thought she looked particularly lovely . She wore a negligee , the front of silver and the train of some sort of velvet brocade , wine colored . There was a fall of silver lace at the elbows , but her arms and the round , white , slim column of throat on which her head moved so easily , were bare . " I have some sherry , " she told him , returning ; " I knew you 'd be wanting something warm when you came in , and I was almost in despair when I found that every drop of whisky I had was gone . Then I bethought me of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is it terrible out ? I do n't remember in my life seeing such a storm . The janitor brought me in an evening paper , and they speak of a possible food shortage . Think it 's likely ? " They seated themselves before the fire , and Bart gratefully drank his sherry , promptly refilling his glass from the decanter on the tile tabouret at his elbow , and the talk he so loved began , Mildred speaking , incisively , wittily , of literature and art , of people and human nature . She stimulated him in turn to expression . He was often surprised and gratified , to hear him/self turn a neat phrase , and to be able to capture in words some elusive thought on the brink of escape . It was Mildred 's influence . He had never talked that way with anybody else . " An astonishingly brilliant woman , " he thought , eyeing her lovely mop of fair hair with its reddish tinge and its graceful sweep about her head . They talked of writers and of hooks and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dismissal ; they talked of marriage and sex and morals . The storm raged , and the snow beat against the windows and piled itself in great white mounds along the sills . But kart and Mildred did not look out upon it . The room was warm and softly lighted , the fire companionable and reassuring ; they were hardly conscious of the rioting tempest . But toward midnight , they did part the folds of the green curtains to gaze upon the flight of torn and tattered ghosts that hurtled past , whipped to their headlong race by the merciless gale . The street lamps revealed a trackless emptiness . The cornices , copings , and ledges of the opposite houses were banked with hoary burdens . Not a vehicle or a pedestrian was in sight . They stood side by side , each with a fold of curtain in hand , looking out upon the windswept scene , and the billows of snow plunging , rollicking , leaping , somersaulting past . Bart thought : " God , I hate to go out in this . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mildred , reading his mind , said : " It 's madness for you to attempt it . Better stay here ; I can make you entirely comfortableon that couch . " A silence followed , and each grew conscious of it . Thoughts catapulted through Bart 's brain . The current between them was flowing  --  electric waves  --  growing stronger and stronger . He could feel his throat drying , his pulse quickening . The headinesshe had experienced once before seized him . The street lamps , slashed by the driving lines of snow , blurred and starred , shooting out a million dazzling rays . l 1 is heart pounded in his breast , his hand tightened on the curtain folds . Then , as if responding to muscles not his own , his left hand , hanging at his side , moved ever so slightly , turned the fraction of a degree , and found hers . Instantly their fingers intertwined , and with the contact , the current between them , flashed to flame . He moved toward her like a drunken man . They caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he breathed , his lips in her hair . " Bart ! " They stood apart , searching one another 's eyes . Slowly their mouths drew nearer ; their lips met . Madness ! " You must not think ; you must not think , " a voice within his whirling brain warned him . Now  --  now  --  here was the woman God , she was gloriousi .... He caught her to him again , kissing her cheek , her temples , her hair , her neck . Her round bare arms were about his head ; she dragged it down to her , clinging fiercely . " I 've always loved you , " she cried with a sob of passion . " Oh , Bart , Bart  --  be good to me ! " Next morning , he once more stood between the curtains in the front room and gazed out upon a world buried in white , silent beneath a leaden sky . The snow had ceased to fall ; the wind had died . Here and there little pigmies of men were already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had laid upon the city . A snow plow with large revolving brushes was sputtering ineffectually at the FiftyninthStreet crossing . Now and then , the sharp scrape of iron on cement sounded a muffled note through the silent , cold air . Remorse  --  stark , terrible , ugly  --  knocked at his heart . Nearer , nearer , imminent now , was the moment when he must reckon with his conscience , . meet his own soul face to face . The room he loved so well was bleak and cold , despite the fire burning in the grate . He felt physically dirty . He rubbed his fingers on either side his chin , conscious of the overnight stubble . Mildred came in , hatted and costumed for the office . He looked at her , surprised he felt no revulsion ; he was not even aware of embarrassment . She appeared just as she always did , fresh , confident , cheerful , smartly groomed and habited . He liked her . She was in love with him . No doubt of that . He liked her because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night had left no room for doubt of how she felt . Poor Mil/dred ! He was sorry for her . She was n't to blame . . . . not her fault ... . She came to stand beside him , slipping an arm through his , her head , in its snug-fitting modish hat , against his shoulder . They stood so for a while , looking down at the white-robed street beneath the gray , leaden sky . Presently there came from her a little quivering sigh . " I suppose , now that I 've found you , I shall lose you , " she said gravely . He made no comment . She went on : " Well , I 've had one night with you . No one can ever take that memory away ... . " Bart , " she said sharply , her manner changing , " do n't think badly of me . I 've dreamed about you for many , many years and hoped some day you 'd come to like Inc . I think , if things had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . I admire you , I think you 're a magnificent person , a very modest , great-hearted soul . I truly believe some clay you 'll make a first-rate writer . You have only to persevere . My heart aches for you , Bart , when I think of how burdened and handicappedyou are , and if I can help you to get on your feet , to become established so that you can quit that damned shoemaker'smagazine and live like a Christian gentleman , I shall have all the reward I want . " He pressed her arm and squeezed the limp cold fingers linked with his own . " Now , I know you are going to go through all kinds of mental agony over what 's happened . I think you 're foolish . No one knows , or will ever know . I understand just how much of yourself you gave me . I suppose you will consider what we 've done as ' sin ' ! It 's sin only if you think it 's sin . Personally , I do n't regard it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my life , and I do n't hold these things as sacred as you do . I believe I 'm right about it , and people will come to my way of thinking sooner or later , and then we 'll have a lot more happiness in the world . In the meantime , I suppose I ca n't prevent you from lacerating your soul with self-reproaches . That 's your nature , and possibly if you were n't so damned Puritanical and strait-laced , built just that way , I should n't care for you as I do . Well , live your hell if you wantP312to , only bear in mind that personally I ca n't see that any harm has been done to anybody so long as they do n't know about it . And no one will ever know about it from me . Blot it from your mind , if it 's going to distress you . You will see , I 'll never embarrass you by an allusion . I shall content myself as best I may in living over and over each moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm about her and warmly kissed her . She closed her eyes , a frown between them , her own arm about his neck , whispering : " Again , Bart dear . . . . again . . . . again .... " Peggy was at her mending when he reached home that afternoon . She was in a low rocker in the embrasure of the sitting room windows , and , as he plunged along through the snowdrifts , making for the brick steps , she rapped on the glass with her thimble to attract his attention and wave at him . Taking off his rubber overshoes in the glassed-in porch , he knocked out the soft snow from the cuffs of his trousers , removed his overcoat , shook that , gave his hat a flick , and with his garments over his arm , passed into the house . Again it was Saturday afternoon . He had remained at the office until nearly one , had stopped at the lunch counter in the Pennsylvania Station for a sandwich and a glass of milk , and had caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hello , " she called to him ; " they let you come home at last , did they ? Was n't that a funny experience ? I 've been trying to remember when you and I have been separated overnight . As I told you this morning when you phoned , I was n't worried . Was n't it nice of Commodore Westover ? He got in on the last train that came through , and then so thoughtfullytelephoned to say he did n't think you 'd make it . Where did you stay ? " He told her the Martinique , kissed her warm cheek , and sat down . " I thought you 'd phone , of course , and then Kate saidP313she ' spected the lines were down , so I called up the operator , and she said they were . Did you feel awfully lonesome ? " " Of course , " he said . lie looked at her critically as she bent over the darning ball , her needle swiftly weaving in and out across the strands of black yarn . Ile wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babbled away about the children and the house . The boys , it seemed , were out toboganning in the Hacket Estates , and Mrs. Westover had called for the girls and taken them sleighing in one of Thornwall 's old sleighs . " I declare , it sounded so sweet and lovely to hear the sleigh bells this morning , " said Peggy . " How is it in the city ? " she asked . He told her , conscious he was listless . " What 's the matter , Bart ? " She gave him a look . " You sound so ' down ' ! " " Tired , I guess . " " Well , Heavenly clay , my dear , I hope you 're not too tired to shovel the walks , because I 've been counting on you doing it this afternoon . " He looked at her , saying nothing . " Clear the walks ? " he thought . " That will take the rest of the afternoon and the better part of to-morrow ! " He had hoped to write . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , there is n't another soul to do it , " she explained . " All the available men are clearing the streets in town . You ought to see it down there ! Why , you just ca n't get through ! " Suddenly he was seized with an impulse to fall on his knees , bury his face in her lap , and pour out his unhappiness , telling her everything , imploring her forgiveness . Ah , he loved her ! He loved her ! He wanted to be right with her and with himself ! Peggy was fair ; she would understand ! He could not be reconciled to himsel f until she knew and had forgiven him . He knew he had done wrong ! He had been false to her and false to the children . He thought of his boys ' confident , hero-worshiping eyes . His throat contracted , and with a swift motion , he covered his eyes . " Bart , you are tired ! " his wife exclaimed , regarding him with solicitude.  | " No-no , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll get at the walks . " Rising abruptly , he left the room , and in a few moments , sweatered and booted , he was fiercely attacking the snowy banks about the house . Towards six o'clock , the boys came stamping home from their tobagganing , their cheeks glowing apple red , their Mackinaw coats powdered and encrusted with snow . A few minutes later , the jingling sleigh stopped before the house , and Jane and Margaret came trooping in , scattering clothing , addingtheir piping cries to their brothers ' shouts . Dickey , who had wakened up cross and fretting from his nap , wailed bitterly with their advent . There was pot roast with mashed potatoes for dinner , and a rice pudding , slightly burned . After the meal was over and the table cleared , Peggy , wistfully , fearing to be refused , asked Bart if he would go with her to the Westovers ' for the evening . They had their sister-inlawfrom Dayton staying with them , she explained , and when the Commodore telephoned the clay before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do Saturday night , they might go over for a session of Five Hundred . Kate , Peggy offered as a clinching argument , had agreed to stay in . Ills sense of wrongdoingweighing heavily upon him , Bart readily consented . She was delighted . She fluttered like a bird over the prospect of the visit , indulging in endless chatter about which dress to wear , interrupting herself . with remarks to the girls and sharp admonitionsto the boys , whom she had agreed to allow to go to the movies . There were no cards , however , at the Westovers ' that evening . Cap Watson and his wife came in , laughing over their tussle with the snow by way of back yards . The men sat in the dining room , smoking cigars , while the Commodore and Cap extolled the merits of the " Stars , " urging Bart to place an order for one ; they 'd all have some great fun racing next summer , they assured him . The women bent their heads together in the adjoining sitting room and told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society . At eleven , Mrs. Westover brought in Grape Juice Punch and some hard-boiled egg sandwiches . Bart took Peggy home shortly afterwards . She was in gay spirits and acted like a frivolous schoolgirl . He thought her very pretty in her flouncy skirt and dangling gold earrings . Putting his arms about her , he hugged her close before she went upstairs , trying to ease his pain , kissing the soft curve of her neck , her cheek , her forehead . For half an hour after she had gone , he sat before his desk , staring at the light , his hands folded on the desk edge in front of him , thinking . Then , with a great sigh , he heaved himself to his feet and went down to the basement to stoke the furnace . The snow , a warrantable excuse , kept them from church the next morning , and everybody slept late . Breakfast over , Bart and the boys floundered through the drifts to the station , secured a copy of the Sunday newspaper , and floundered home again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of the " funny " sheet , while Bart looked at the headlines , read the theatrical news , the reviews , and advertisementson the book page . Towards eleven , he donned his sweater and boots and , assisted ineffectually by his sons , attacked once more the deep snow along the sidewalk before the house . He was at it again in the afternoon , and long before the job was finished his back was aching and his hands were sore and blistered . He slept then until roused for the inevitable baked beans and hot chocolate supper at six-thirty . That night he worked a little on his story , but felt low-spirited , uninspired , and tore up the three pages he had written without reading them . Monday , he was at his office , with Mr. Vonderlies and Madame Blum handing him photographs of shoes for the engraver , and Mr. Solomon yelling at him to know why the half-tone cut of a stitching-room nippers which the American Shoe Machinery Corporation had sent in to accompany their ad , had been left out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in unintelligible German . At noon , he went out with Mr. Vonderlies to lunch on imported frankfurters , sauerkraut , and a stein of near-beer at a neighboring Third Avenue restaurant , afterwards accompanying the old man to a pawnbroker 's shop to watch him select from a tray , and for ten cents , a pair of nose glasses whose lenses best suited his aging eyesight . The afternoon was a repetition of the morning , except that Miss Schwartz left a note on his desk to say she had a " splitting " headache and had gone home , bequeathing him in consequence the task of locating sixty cuts which Mr. Bliss wanted " proved up " immediately , so that he might paste their proofs into a dummy and take it on the late afternoon train for Boston , where he hoped to book an advertiser for a full page . The five-twenty home that night . There were still no taxis moving , and Bart had to walk from the station . He found John , who had been hit on the ear with a hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . Dan was in disgrace for having been " saucy " to Kate , while the small girls , aided by their mother , were intent upon making valentines in Bart 's study . Scissors , paste , brushes , and colored-paper clippings littered the floor . Dinner was late because the butcher boy had left the wrong order . Peggy was worried . Dickey , she was satisfied , had definitely an " upset . " I3art had no more than started his work that evening , when she sent him down through the snow to the drug store for castor oil . " Tuesday varied only in detail from this dull round ; Wednesdaywas the same ; Thursday , no different . The awful sameness and emptiness oppressed him as never before . Several times , when he was alone , he found himself involuntarily covering his face with his hands to prevent his screaming out a protest against the utter drabness of his existence . Shut away in his mind , as if by a door , was Mildred , the room he loved , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so slim , so perfect , so beautifully made . He would not let himself think of her , but she was there  --  in the little chamber of his mind . He had only to open the door . . . . He wrestled with himself , concentrating his thoughts on Peggy , reminding himself of her goodness , her cheerfulness , her loyalty , her love , her sweet beauty . He conjured up oldP317memories of their early clays together in New York , their happy , first weeks in the three-room apartment equipped with King Ludwig 's furniture , hot summer nights lying in bed with only a sheet for cover , meetings in Central Park , the long , trying , worried months before Danny was born , the night of awful travail at the hospital , and then the hard years that had followed in the Bronx . He exerted himself to please her , humored her whims , did odd jobs for her about the house , brought her little presents from the city . " Oh , my God ! " he burst out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , Peggy . Let 's go ' way together . Let 's go out to the ranch in California and get away from all this cold and snow and ugliness . " " Why , what 's the matter with you , Bart ? T think you must be sick or something . " " Guess I am ; guess I 'm sick ; T do n't know what 's the matter with me . I only know I just want you and the children  --  and I want to go away from here . " " My goodness , Bart , I do n't know what you 're thinking about ! " " I do n't know either . I know I hate New York , I hate The Shoe ! Egis , I hate Port Washington  --  these people  --  this house  --  everything ! Let 's pull up stakes and clear out . Come on , Peggy , will you ? " " You must be crazy ! I never heard such foolishness ! Why , we have our own lovely home here , our children go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ours , you 're a very prominent member of the Yacht Club , and I may he president of the Village Welfare Society some day . This is our home , where we belong ; we 've grown up here and occupy a place in the community . You 're just working and worrying yourself to death over that silly old novel of yours . I wish to goodness you 'd give it up ! " He was silenced . Another evening , he said : " Peg dear , could n't you and I go on a little trip this coming week-end ? We have n't been away together since I do n't know when . Leave the children with Kate ; they 'll be all right . Let 's go down to Atlantic City next Saturday ; we can take the three o'clock train , spend the night there at one of the big hotels , and walk up and down on the Boardwalk on Sunday .... " She looked at him with a frankly puzzled expression . " I do n't know what 's the matter with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby now with his upset tummy , and I would n't for the world . Besides , Leelee has the Five Hundred Club next Saturday night , and we do n't want to miss that ! " He gazed at her , battling down a sobbing heave , stilling with an effort the smarting of his eyes . " Do you love me , Peg ? " he demanded . " Of course I do , silly , only you 've got to be sensible . Why , Heavenly day , I ca n't run off to Atlantic City with you just like that ! I could n't leave the children , and I have n't any clothes , and besides , it would cost a lot of money , and you know it , and I do n't think we have the right to spend so much for just our own pleasure , particularly when Dan and Jack both need shoes again  --  I declare , I do n't know how they wear them out !  --  and I certainly would n't feel like wasting so much on a gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holes in their soles . " He wanted to scream again , twist his fingers in his hair and tear it . Friday morning , a boy opened the door of his office . " Mr. Carter ? " At Bart 's nod , he handed him an envelope and went out . " Bart Darling read the note : Ca n't you arrange to come up to lunch to-morrow at one ? I want so much to see you . M. " He stared , reading it over several times . Then there came from him a long weary breath . " Oh .... " Something broke within him . That evening he said casually to Peggy over his plate of soup :   " I may have to stay in to-morrow afternoon . We 're getting out the Spring Fashion number , and I suppose there 'll be plenty of last-minute things to ( 1o . Better not count on me ' earlier than the five-twenty . " " Some things , " he said to himself later as he stared down at his manuscript , " are just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am . " Then he flung himself into his work , the words pouring from him in a rush , and he knew he was writing well . P320SPRING broke in a glory of green and warm , heartening sunshine . The Avenue bloomed with window boxes ; the public squares were brave with red and yellow tulips ; the country was sweet and full of earthy smells ; dogwood checkered the leafing trees between Great Neck and Port Washington . " Dearest , " Peggy said to Bart , " a week from to-morrow is our anniversary , and I thought I 'd ask the Westovers , the Fultons , and the P. M. G. Millers for dinner , and Marjorie Miller can teach us a lot about bridge . You see , we 'd have two tables , and she 'll circulate between them . I 'll give the children an early supper , and get in Kate 's sister , Jule , to help ; we 'll have a cake and candles , and I thought I 'd ask Leelee to let me have some of that dandelion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said indifferently . His mind was upon a performance of Carmen at the Metropolitan to which Mildred had taken him the previous Saturday afternoon . A friend had sent her a couple of seats . Ile was thinking of the end of the second act where Jose has decided to throw in his lot with Carmen and the smugglers . " La liberte , " the chorus and principles had sung ; " la liberte . . . . la liberte .... " Mildred had squeezed his hand as it lay hidden beneath a fold of her dress , and he had squeezed hers in return . " La liberte . . . . " " Peggy dear , " he said to her in May , " I 'm going to take my two weeks ' vacation the latter half of this month , and I 'm going away alone somewhere , I think to a little town called P321New Canaan in Connecticut where there 's a nice quiet inn . I 'll finish this book of mine there . The chances look good for my selling it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're to run it , the manuscript has to be in by the first of June . The story 's finished , but I have a lot of typing and revising to do , and it will take me every hit of two weeks . I 'll never get it done if I stay home ; there are too many distractions and interruptions . " Peggy made no immediate answer . She sat not far from his desk in the study , shelling peas from a large brown paper bag . To-morrow was hate 's day off . " How often do you see Mildred Bransom ? " she asked , intent on filling her lap with a large handful of pods . He tried to speak naturally , but his tone lacked smoothness . " Oh  --  she telephones now and then . " " She telephones ? " " Well . . . . maybe I do ; I do n't remember . " " Do you see her ? " " Occasionally . " " Where ? " " Well , ah  --  where do you suppose ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course not . I go to her office . " Silence . " Well , it seems to me you might work just as well here " Out of the question ! " "  --  and I think it 's just horrid of you to spend your vacation away from us when we had so much fun last year : The children are counting on it , and everything . " " I know , Peg , but this may mean money , a great deal of it . I ca n't afford to miss the opportunity . Mildred likes my story ; says she feels sure Crosby 's take it . " An interval . " She 's read it , has she ? " " Part of it . " " When did she read it ? " " Oh , I do n't know ; ' way last January or February , some-P322time . I met her on the train , and she said she 'd like to see some of my work . I told you about it . " Peggy bent her head over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows a thing she 's talking about . " " Oh , come , Peg ; she 's managing editor for Crosby 's . He would n't be paying her twelve thousand a year if she was a numskull . " " She 's not getting any twelve thousand a year ! " " Oh , yes , she is . " " I do n't believe it . " " Well , that does n't prove it is n't so . " Peggy let her hands fall into her lap , and faced him . " She 's just stringing you , Bart . " He flushed , his jaws clicking . He shrugged . " Ca n't you see she 's just fooling you ? She 's just feeding you on hopes Mr. Crosby may take your story , and you know perfectly well he 'll do nothing of the kind . Oh , it 's as plain as paint to me ! It 's because of her you 've been wasting all your time scribbling away at that old thing . This whole winter and spring you 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , always saying whenever there was a chance to help me or play with them  --  give them a little bit of your attention or companionship  --  that you could n't , you had to work ! Now I see it 's all been just to please that woman ! Why , she 's fooling you , Bart , pulling the wool over your eyes . I suppose you go up to her rooms and read her what you 've written , and she tells you how wonderfulyou are ! " He refused to commit himself , and Peggy rushed on . " I do n't see how you can be so  --  so despicable ! You know Mildred Bransom is in love with you , and you go to see her  --  I do n't know when or how  --  and then you come home to me and the children ! .... I suppose you kiss and fondle her He stopped her with an oath , rising to his feet , striking the desk with the flat of his hand . " That 's a damned lie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and strode out into the spring night , banging the front door behind him . P323He did go to New Canaan in mid-May , and Mildred on two occasions went up to Stamford , where he met her and motored with her by taxi to Greenwich , where a couple , friends of Mildred 's , had a house . The couple were away in Europe , but had told Mildred to make use of their home whenever she chose . It was a cunning little house with an imitation thatched roof of rolling shingles and was set in a lovely garden bounded by a high stone wall . Its gate stood in a round arch of masonry , and a rambler rose vine , thick with leaves , almost hid the stones from sight . There were no servants ; only a gardener caretaker . The setting was idyllic , the situation romantic . The walled-in garden was gay with spring flowers  --  daffodils , pansies , verbena , and syringa ; there were neatly clipped box hedges along the narrow graveled walks , and a fountain of colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child holding up a turtle . The place was meticulously cared for by old Rafaele , who smiled and smirked at the visitors , showing his gold teeth broadly in welcome . He called them Signor and Signora and was happy to do what he could to make them comfortable . It was fun to enter the empty house , which had not been occupied since the previous summer , investigate the kitchen , the bedrooms upstairs , the arrangement below , remove some of the dusty covers that protected the furniture , hunt for the linen closet , make up dismantled beds , and start preparations for dinner . There was electricity but no gas , and Mildred , nothing daunted , proceeded to cook their evening meal with an electric percolator , an electric toaster , while upon an inverted pressing iron she most successfully scrambled eggs . The repast , Bart pronounced a triumph , and with cheese and a bottle of Chianti and other delectable edibles Mildred had brought up with her from the city , they fared sumptuously . At night there was a moon ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the tiny patter of water in the low tiled fountain sounded like the tinkle of a guitar . But despite the charm and romantic adventure , despite the laughter and love-making , Bart was not happy . He could not abandon himself as Mildred did , joyously and completely , to their hours together . Back again in New Canaan , he thought long and seriously over the situation , but could come to no decision . Peggy and the children were the foundation of his existence , the background of his life ; yet , loving them deeply and devotedly as he did , he could not entertain the thought of relinquishing Mildred . He had not the strength to do it . His days would be utterly desolate without her . Never to lunch , talk , or be with her again was too awful even to contemplate , yet he knew he was chancing the wreckage of all he prized and loved most . " Oh , my God , " he groaned in desperation more than once , " whatever is to become of me ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estrangementbetween himself and Peggy . Not that she was cold or unpleasant ; he frequently thought her unusually kind and considerate , less critical than ordinarily . Nevertheless , there was a difference ; he could not put his finger upon it . She evaded him , if nothing more . He was conscious , too , that his manner toward her was not the same as it had been ; he was restrained , less irritable , less communicative . Any demonstration of affection on his part made him feel hypocritical . He could not put his arms about her , hug and embrace her without self-consciousness . Sometimes , when he forced himself to be affectionate , he suspected she was not fooled . He came to kiss her less and less . He did not call her " muggins " any more . One night , some weeks after New Canaan , he went to her in the sitting room , where she sat at her small desk writing to Jane , and laid before her a buff , oblong piece of paper . It was a check drawn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Jonathan A. Crosby . " She picked it up , examined it , then raised her wide brown questioning eyes to his face . " They took it , " he said , smiling .   " Your story ? " " The Hacienda . That 's for the serial rights . " She fingered the check a moment niore , then gently placed it on the desk 's edge before hint . Ile could see hey biting her lip and that she was troubled . Ile felt sorry for her . " That will take care of both mortgages , " he said . " I telephonedGill 's attorney , and he said we could take up the four thousand whenever we wished . I told him to draw up the papers and I 'd be in next week with a certified check . The first mortgage comes ( Inc the first of next month , and I told Chip Rhodes we would not renew . That increases our incomeby six hundred a year , and beginning next month I 'll deposit an extra fifty dollars to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to him . Ile sensed she felt keenly her defeat , and stooping down he kissed her hair , then went back to his study and to the short story he was attempting . An hour later , she came to stand in the doorway . " I do n't think I said how pleased I am for you , Bart . I know what this must mean to you . I 'm very happy  --  very happy about it , indeed . I  --  I 'm proud , " she finished lamely . He knew she was thinking of Mildred . It had been Mildred , of course , who had persuaded Mr. Crosby to accept The Hacienda . Bart looked at her with an indulgent smile . " My dear , " he said , " I 'm sure you 're glad about it . And the money will come in handy , wo n't it ? " " Yes , indeed , " she said . As the summer progressed , he grew accustomed to his relationship with either woman . Ile spent what time he could in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , the less his conscience troubled him . When uncomfortable thoughts arose , he shook them from him . The triangle would work itself out some way or other , he assured himself . It would end naturally , and then he would not have to be hypocritical with Peggy any more . Mildred went to Mansfield in July and took her mother up to Lake Geneva in Wisconsin for the worst of the hot weather .   Her letters to him were delightfully amusing . She illustrated them with ridiculous little pictures which made him laugh . Now and then she waxed loving , but her words of affection made him squirm , though at the same time they made him long for her . He toiled at his writing while she was away , sometimes conscious of relief at her absence , sometimes feeling desperatelythe need of her sympathy and encouragement . He and Peggy and the children had some happy times that summer . The battered Dodge was equipped with new tires , and frequently , on Sundays , his wife would pack a picnic basket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or down the Sound side of the Island . The water , in an odd way , brought Mildred to Bart 's mind , and after luncheon , when the thermos bottles had been put back into their case , and the trash of boxes , paper , and other refuse had been burned , he would sit a little apart from the rest and dream of her . He was unprepared , and a little discomfited when unexpectedlyshe came back to the city a week sooner than planned , and when her laughing , breathless voice sounded over the telephone , he was aware of a definite feeling of distaste , but it was for that moment only . In less than half an hour , she was in his arms and he was devouring her with his lips . Life seemed to settle down then to a fairly normal round . He was with Mildred whenever possible , usually on Saturdayafternoons , sometimes for a stolen hour or two before train time , sometimes at the Waldorf for luncheon . Once , when he had to put in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would stay in town , joined Mildred at eleven , and spent the night with her . There seemed to be a kind of a truce between himself and his wife . He noticed she rarely reproached him these days for his usual delinquencies . Her manner troubled him , and now and then he longed for one of her old scoldings . The children'sracket disturbed him occasionally . He sometimes shouted at the boys to stop their infernal uproar , but more often he enjoyed their rough ways and chatter , especially Dan 's , who had a habit of coming to stand before him , hands thrust into his trouser pockets , feet wide apart , to ask questions aboutp327matters which perplexed him , with a frown between his eyes and lips puckered together in judicial fashion . The five-yearoldMargaret , too , had a special appeal for her father . She would climb into his lap , give him a fairy-like kiss , and look about her with a shrewd perception which delighted him . A wise child , he considered her . The petty demands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago had spelled annoyance for him did not now trouble hint so much . He no longer worried over Kate 's tantrums , nor minded having to straighten the furniture or pick up after the children 's games . I fe did not fret at having to stoke the furnace the last thing at night , or shake it down and open the dampers the first thing in the morning . There was more peace iii the house and his nerves seemed less on edge than at any time in the previous two years . He came too , to enjoy his shabby , comfortable room at the head of the back stairs , just as Peggy had predicted . He was alone ; he need disturb no one . He might read at night if he liked , smoke a cigarette in bed , or enjoy one before he arose . His clothing , books , and papers were always to be found just where he had left them . The children were not allowed to enter this sanctum . " That 's Daddy 's room . No one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get socked if you go in there . Mom will get after you like anything ! " Peggy no longer prodded him awake from the adjoining bed with a sleepy request to " please take up the baby . " He might sleep Sunday mornings if he liked , he was not expected to attend Mass , he could go up and down the back stairs , to and from his room , without passing through his wife 's chamber . Only one element in his life was still repugnant to his sensibilities , and that was his connection with The Shoe AEgis . Even old Mr. Vonderlies , a kindly , gentle soul , began to take on the characteristics of a little withered gnome ; Madame Blum disgusted him ; Max Solomon he hated , and he took pleasure sometimes in imagining himself sinking his clawed fingers into the man 's fat blue jowl . But more than his associates , he despised himself for subjecting his brain and hands to the contemptible business of making and sorting halftonecuts for a shoe magazine ! He knew he possessed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mildred confirmed and encouraged him . She was constantly urging him to resign from The AEgis Her manner toward him became increasingly proprietary . She advised him about everything , about what he should do and what he should say , what he should wear and what he should eat , how he should spend his money . He did not resent it ; he recognized her to be a smart , shrewd woman , and he was content to have her direct him . She understood more about life , business , and current literature , he considered , than anybodyhe had ever known . Only in her attitude toward Peggy and toward what he regarded as peremptory obligations to his wife did he take issue with her . He still felt that whatevertime he and Mildred spent together was so much sheer gain ; it was conceded from a deeper , stronger , more enduringbond . This nettled Mildred , but she refrained from discussingit . Always she labored to stimulate him to literary effort , advising him , criticizing his work , marketing his products . That fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and directed him in their composition . Two of them she bought for Crosby 's , and the third she declared she could sell for a better price than her magazine could afford to pay . Without trouble , she disposed of it to a popular weekly for seven hundred and fifty dollars . At her urging , he began another serial to follow The Hacienda . This was to be a story similar in vein and treatment and was to be calledThe Alcazar . P329THE first installment of The Hacienda appeared in the March issue of Crosby 's . The title and Bart 's name were conspicuouslylettered on the cover , as it was the leading feature of the magazine , and it was excellently illustrated by one of the best known magazine artists . Mildred had not divulged her plans . When she put an advance copy into Bart 's hands , he gasped and choked with emotion . When Peggy 's eyes fell upon it , she saw in it only the confirmation of her suspicions : the duplicity of her husband and his immoral entanglement with the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an oriflamme advertising their shame . Bart had not foreseen her reaction . It staggered him . She had known all along that Crosby 's had accepted his story ; it was merely a matter of time before it appeared in its pages . He had handed her the same advance copy which , earlier in the day , Mildred had given him , and did so with a proud and happy smile , confidently expecting Peggy 's jubilant congratulation . She accepted the magazine , gazed only a moment at its gay red and yellow cover on which Bart 's name was prominentlydisplayed . Then her nostrils dilated , her face congested , and with a swift , furious motion she tore the gaudy picture from the book , rent the stiff paper in two , and fled upstairs . Bart was angrier than he had ever been in his life . He stood looking down at the torn scraps and mutilated book , and something welled up within him and burst . His sweating nights of labor , his titanic wrestle with himself to wring this story from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all been for Peggy and the kids ! To pay off the mortgages on the house ! Here were his thanks  --  his reward  --  his wife 's appreciation ! P330He picked up the paper fragments of the torn magazine with shaking fingers . He stood there , looking at them . His lips trembled , his chin shook . Then he caught up his hat and strode out of the house , cramming scraps and book into his pocket , banging the house door and that of the glassed-in front porch behind him , and hurried with long , determined strides in the direction of the station . There he telephoned Mildredto expect him , and caught the next train for New York . He was calmer by the time he reached her apartment , but he promptly eased his mind to her of all the thoughts he had been thinking , criticizing Peggy as never before , telling her of his wife 's ungenerous attitude and jealousy of his work , her lack of imagination , indifference to artistic beauty , and unsympatheticpoint of view . Mildred clung to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding and with tears . " My poor boy , my poor , poor boy , " she said , and she caught his head and hugged it to her breast . She had prepared cocktails , as well as something agreeable to eat , by the time he arrived . She urged these upon him , assuring hint the food would help him and that she would not talk to him until he had relaxed . There was Chianti with the meal , vodka afterwards , and Bart plied himself deliberately with the intoxicants . He wanted to keep alive his mood of resentment against Peggy ; he was angry , and wished to remain so . When ' Stasia had cleared the table and he and Mildred were comfortably established in their favorite seats before the fire , she said to him : " I 've been thinking for a long time of having a serious talk with you , Bart , and this last foolish act of Peggy makes right now , it seems to me , the time to say all I have on my mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it to end ? I 'm not thinking of myself , I 'm thinking of you . You and I have come to care for one another ; we have in common that ineffablep331something which makes for an enduring and perfect companionship . ... Do you want to give me up , Bart ? " " No-no  --  no-no-no ! " " Well , then , what 's the answer ? You can not go on trying to fill the lives of two women who expect the same things of you . Now , just let me in cold , unemotional logic describe what each of us has to offer : " Peggy makes you a home ; she 's honest , faithful , devoted , loyal ; she 's kind and considerate , according to her lights . She 's the mother of your children ; she 's borne you five , and that 's a very important consideration . She 's capable , loving , and she shares with you the memory of ten years ' hard , uphill struggle which has gotten you both as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vital bond . lint what else does she give you ? I 've gathered , from what you 've hinted now and then , she denies you your rightful marital privileges . That would give you an excellent reason for demanding a divorce iii any fairmindedcourt of justice . But let that pass . She 's no longer a wife to you in that sense and probably will never he again . . . . . More important , to my mind , is that she is incapable of giving you the mental companionship you deserve ; she is unable to keep step with your mental growth , she lacks the capacity of stimulating you to self-expression , is out of sympathy with your work , unappreciative of your talents , and has no inclination to help you take your proper place in the world of letters . Bart , Peggy 's great sin is that she is stupid , and stupidity is the greatest of all crimes . If you stick to her and allow your conduct to be ruled by antiquated , preposterous , narrow , and uncivilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a shoe magazine the rest of your life , and die a disappointed , worried , bitter old man ! " Now , let me present my case . I offer you , in the first place , liberty . You are free to come and go as you like , do as you please . I demand nothing of you ; I urge only that you follow my lead and guidance in your quest for literary success . I only ask the privilege of helping you to write , to give your pen a chance and make you rich and famous . I only want the world to acknowledge you , to justify my opinion of your work . To be perfectly honest with you , I want to prove to you I am right and Peggy wrong . More than this , I offer you all I have , my life , my devotion , and myself . It is not as though I had only come to care for you during the past year . I 've loved you almost as long as Peggy has . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact moment I began to care for you . It was the day I was showing you and Peggy my apartment ; Peggy had gone into the kitchen to see about something , and you and I were standing in the front room . Oh , God , how well I remember it ! You 've never been out of my head or my heart since . I 'm not ashamed of loving you . I 'm proud of it ; I glory in it And , Bart , dear , if you walked out of that door this minute and I knew I was never to see you again , I would have this thought to comfort me for the rest of my days and no one could ever take it from me : Thank God , I 've had him for a little ; thank God , I 've helped him on his way ; thank God , I 've earned the right to have him think of me in gratitude and affection , and no matter what happens to him , he will never , never forget me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white hands with fingers closed , pressed against her face . He tried to take her in his arms , callingher name in his distress and sympathy , but she pushed him away almost with impatience . " Oh , I 'm not bawling to win your sympathy , to move you to love me by a lot of hysterical tears ! I want to be honest with you . " I tell you , I do n't give a damn about myself in this business . I can get along without you ; I 've clone it for ten years , and I dare say I can do it for ten more . I 've got my job and my work , and I 'm tremendously interested in both . If you leave me and go back to Peggy , I sha n't commit suicide or mope myself to death . I wo n't bother you , and you can shift for yourself . I 'm not the whining sort of woman who tags after a man . I repeat , I 'm not thinking or caring about myself . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bart , you need me , you ca n't get along without me ; you will never become a successful author without me by your side . I know my stuff ' ; literature to-day is a business ; I 'm a business woman . An editor in this day and generation has to understand business , and run a magazine along business lines . I do n't know anything about literachoor ! I know what will put on circulation . I do n't want to be a writer ; I want you to be one . Every instinct I have , P333and all my training , tells me that you can write stories that will sell . You need only guidance . I 've been connected with newspapers and magazines for fifteen years . I 've learned something in that time . I 've learned to recognize a writer , and I know you are one . Everywhere I find justification of my opinion . I do n't know how many of the girls , and some of the men round the office , have cone to me begging me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even Jonathan Crosby , who has n't any particular love for you , told me the other day what a corking good story he thought The Hacienda was . You mark my words , when that book is published , it 's going to sell and sell in the neighborhood of half a hundred thousand . And some time or other I 've got to talk to you about a publisher . I 've an up-and-alive new firm for you that will give you an advance of five thousand and pay you a fifteen per cent royalty or you 'll not put pen to contract ! " You 're nothing but a child where you , yourself , are concerned , Bart . You are like every other genius who ever lived . You need someone to direct you , protect you , stimulate and understand you . I can do all those things . Peggy ca n't and never will . The time 's coming it may not be now , this week or this month  --  when you will have to choose between us , and I want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've tried to figure out what my own course should be in this mess . I 've asked myself , should I let you alone and allow you to come to your own conclusion , or should I fight for you and for myself , risking your coming sometime to believe me a scheming , designing woman who stole you away from your wife ? It 's not been easy to decide . Just of late it 's come over me that the only person to be considered is you ; you are worth a dozen Mildreds and a dozen Peggys , and I 'm going to do everything I can to save you from being an employee on a shoe magazine for the rest of your life ! " His recent anger at Peggy , the liquor he had drunk , Mildred'seloquence , all contributed to put Bart into an highly emotional mood . As his companion ended , he sat with his forehead clutched in both hands , elbows on his knees , eyes fixed on the flickering coals in the grate before him . At the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other way for him but to give up Peggy and the children . Suddenly he broke into tears . Mildred waited until he had quieted , then slipped to her knees before him and took his head in her arms . He caught her to him roughly , burying his face in her neck , and cried brokenly : " God , God , Mildred ! Help me do it  --  stick by me  --  do n't let me weaken . I need you  --  I ca n't live without you ! " But the following morning he was by no means sure that that was what he ought to do . It was borne in upon him , too , that in leaving home the evening before , staying away the night , he had given Peggy further evidence  --  convincing this time  --  of his unfaithfulness . She would be furious with him , might now even want to leave him . Even so , he was a long way from wanting to leave her , or from giving up Danny , Johnny , Jane , Margaret , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , anxious to find out what his reception was to be . It was as bad as his worst fears . Peggy met him with cold , stern eyes and would not speak . Neither at dinner nor later did she address him . There was even no pretense of friendliness before the children . They knew , all of them , that their parents were having a quarrel . Mom was mad at Dad ; she would n't speak to him . Even fat , turbulent Kate , in the kitchen , was aware of the estrangement . There was no attempt at conversation by anyoneduring the meal . Peggy served the vegetables , passed the plates , spoke briefly to the children , a steely and an uncompromisinghardness in her face and manner . Bart fled to his study and crept up the back stairs to his room as soon as the family were in bed . There was no variation next day , or the next , or the one following . Apparently it was always to be so . The house was like a house with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cheerfully as he was able to the children , brought them little gifts from town , tried to amuse them , regaled them with stories . He made no headway with his wife . Sometimes he caught the glint of tears in her wide dark eyes , but they didP335not fall . Her head she held high , and he knew better than to . approach her with any words of conciliation . " This ca n't go on forever ! " he said , in disgust . In the evenings he worked at his story , sometimes staying at his desk until past midnight , now and then getting in an hour or so of copying before breakfast . He saw Mildred almost every day ; if he did not see her , he telephoned . Frequently he wrote her from the office , particularly when he felt low-spirited . To his gloomy account of the dreary condition of affairs at home she listened sympathetically , at the same time with impatience , assuring him , as he assured himself , that such a state of things could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the newsstands , and Bart enjoyed to the full the glory of the literary spotlight . His fellow commuters on the train congratulated him  --  his name on the cover , author of the big serial ! At the offices of The Shoe AEgis , he was sure he detected a new deference . His old publisher wrote him a honeyed letter saying he hoped to have the privilege of bringing out The Hacienda in the fall . In the windows of bookstores , or wherever magazines were sold , his eye promptly found Crosby 's , and his own name in satisfying capital letters . Perhaps it was his new sense of importance , perhaps it was a feeling on Mr. Max Solomon 's part that his art editor was getting exalted opinions of himself  --  whatever the contributing cause , the clash between them , which Bart had long foreseen , suddenly took place . Mr. Solomon 's voice was louder and coarser than usual one morning , and Bart rose wearily to his feet , saying indifferently : " Aw , go to hell ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm through , " Bart corrected him . It was a satisfaction to telephone the news to Mildred , and her happiness , her congratulations warmed his heart . ButP336Peggy , he could not tell . He realized as much on his way uptownto meet Mildred for lunch . How do it ? Say what ? At any rate , now was not the time . Yet where could he go , and what should he do with himself during the day , with no office needing him ? It was impossible for him to remain at home , working in his study , with a resentful wife in the house who would not speak to him . He laid this before Mildred when she joined him , breathless from excitement and the street . " Why , my dear boy , why not come here and work ? This room you 're so fond of is just the place ! You 'll be quiet here , nobody will disturb you , and I 'll come home every day at one o'clock , have lunch with you , and talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a little walk in the afternoon or go to a movie , why , that will be fine , and you can catch your usual train home to Port Washington , and Peggy 'll be none the wiser . " But , Bart dear , how long is this going to keep up ? Do n't you see you ca n't go on this way , deceiving Peggy , worrying about her ? It is n't right  --  it is n't fair to yourself . How can you write , do your best work , when you 're all upset ? " How indeed ? How satisfy both women ? He sighed heavily , despising himself for not having courage to solve the problem . He refused to consider parting from his wife and children ; he would not give up Mildred . Silently and alone he ate his breakfast , took his customary train , and when lie reached the city , went to Mildred 's apartment . There it was warm and pleasant ; a fire would be burning , the desk cleared , and there would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good morning 's work tucked into a corner of the desk blotter . In the quiet , pleasant room , with just enough stir and sound coming from Anastasia in the rear of the apartment to keep him from feeling lonely , he bent to his work . Mildred had told him the reception of The Hacienda assured him his next story would be accepted , and she was anxious to begin it after the final installment of the first . That this might be possible , it would be necessary for him to complete TheP337Alccizar by the end of May . The progress made by his uninterruptedmorning 's work pleased and surprised him , although he could not tell whether it was good or bad . Mildred reassuredhim . She criticized and suggested , firing his enthusiasm ; the story grew and began to take on more and more of the adventurous , romantic duality which had so **25;557;TOOLONG his earlier effort . At a little before one o'clock , she would arrive to have lunch with him . Anastasia always had a delightful repast prepared . The maid came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work , quietly set the table  --  dainty lace doilies on the polished wood , shining silverware , the fragile green glasses , a howl of fruit or flowers in its center . Bart delighted in these lunches ; 1w was spent and hungry by the time they were ready . The food , the glass of wine , the companionshipof Mildred were all perfect . The hour of relaxation was like warm , reviving sunlight . In the afternoon , he would sit in a loge at a motion-picture house , or go to the matinee of a play , and at twenty minutes past five , take his usual train for Port Washington , to meet , when he reached his home , the hard , unforgiving countenance of his wife and the wondering , unhappy looks of his children . After the ordeal of dinner , he would shut himself up in his study and write . Upstairs the children would racket until bedtime ; occasionally he would catch the sound of Peggy 's gay , unrestrained laughter , and thrill to the tones of her natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to his ears . When he had finished for the night , and the house was still , everyone asleep , he would close his binder , switch off the lights , go to the basement to replenish the furnace , then silently climb the back flights to his solitary room . Dan Thornwall came over on Sunday mornings to drive Peggy , Kate and the children to early Mass. lie did not accompanythem . There was never any occasion to take the Dodge out of the garage . Week-ends were terrible . He spent as much time as he could away from the house . P338One day Mildred burst in upon him at his work half an hour earlier than usual , and even before she had taken off her things or kissed him , he saw she was unusually excited . " Wait , wait , " she checked him , " wait until I have a cocktail . I ca n't tell you what 's happened until I have a drink . Oh , Bart , it 's just wonderful  --  wonderful  --  wonderful . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to see her at her office several days previously . Mr. Anderson was a motionpictureagent , a broker , whom Mildred had known for many years . He had informed her a certain movie star was interested in The Hacienda as a vehicle for himself and had wired Mr. Anderson to procure for him , if possible , galley sheets of the balance of the story . " So , I dug up a dirty old set I had in my desk , " Mildred hurried on , " and gave them to him , and this morning he came to see me  --  and , my dear , who , do you suppose , wants to buy and film your story ? " She kept Bart in suspense a moment , and then mentioned the star 's name . " You see , it just suits him  --  you know the kind of stuff he does  --  and he 's crazy about it , Anderson says , wants to make it immediately , and  --  my dear , wait till I tell you : he offers twenty-jive thousand dollars for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no further motion . Mildredcontinued . She had told Mr. Anderson she could speak for the author , and that if he could promise her that the money would be forthcoming on the signing of the contract , Mr. Carter , she knew , would find the price satisfactory . The agent had assured her that there would not be the slightest difficulty about that , and Mildred had told him to go ahead and draw up the contract . " Well , are n't you thrilled ? You sit there looking at me like a perfect dummy ! Think , my boy , what this is going to mean to you ! Twenty-five thousand dollars ! Why , my goodness , Bart , you 're made ; nothing can stop you now . You have n't a notion what publicity you 're going to get out of this , and you need n't worry about money again as long as you live . They'llP339take everything you write now  --  editors , publishers , producers . All you will have to do is to decide what you want to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you realize it ? Five times the amount that old spider Solomon was paying you for a year 's work on The Shoe AEgis ! " Five years ' salary ! Bart kept repeating the phrase after Mildred had left him Five years ' salary ! The thought of so much money did not elate him . He was conscious only of sadness and depression . The past ten years of grubbing work , the years of makeshifts , worry , and poverty which 1w and Peggy had shared , rose up in memory to confront him . He recalled the first months of their wedded life , when she had so often walked over to Third Avenue to bargain with butcher or vegetable vendor for two pounds of rump beef and a handful of carrots , onions , and greens . He remembered the days when Danny was on the way , how she had skimped , saved , and denied herself small comforts , the simplest of luxuries , so that there might be enough money on hand to pay the doctor and the hospital bills when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for herself at the time  --  the plainest of print cottons  --  and how she had cooked , washed , darned , and planned to save dollars and quarters , nickels and dimes . He remembered , too , the succeeding years , when Johnny had followedDan , Janey followed John , Margaret and Dickey had come along in turn . Peggy had never whimpered nor complained . She had borne each child with fortitude and faith , loving it from the moment she knew she was to have it , sorry only for him and the additional burden imposed ! Twenty-five thousand dollars ! His heart suddenly cried out . Twenty-five thousand dollars ? What did it mean to him ? Could n't he go to her , lay it before her , and have her rejoice with him as she had always clone whenever a windfall came their way ? What was the value of money to him if the joy of its unexpectedness and the fun of spending it was not to be shared with her ? P340Here was concrete evidence he could write , make money with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars for a story without merit ! Mildred Bransom had had nothing to do with that . Peggy would have seen so much for herself . Oh , where was there any health in life ? Where had all the sanity and the goodness and the self-respect and the joy in it disappeared ? Mildred ? What the devil did she matter ? She did not need him . Peggy did . Mildred had her job and her work ; they absorbed her . She had said so herself . Peggy had only him and the kids . Suddenly it came to him he must see Peggy , go to her at once , make peace with her , win her back . He caught a taxicab in the street and drove to the PennsylvaniaStation . On the train he realized how rotten and contemptible he had been  --  vacillating , uncertain of mind , swayed by passing emotions , influenced by any favoring wind that blew his way , trimming his sails to it ... . Oh , God , what a bum he was ! But he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . What was the worth of life without children and a wife beside hint ? What was the use of work , of advancement , of success ? What was the satisfaction in becoming a writer if Peggy and the kids were not to share in its rewards ? ... . Mildred be damned ! He would forcibly take Peggy in his arms ; he would tell her how sorry he was  --  oh , how terribly , terribly sorry ! He would tell her he 'd make it up to her . He just would n't let her be angry with him any more . He 'd make a complete confessionof the whole miserable affair  --  a clean breast of it  --  and he 'd beg her , implore her to take him back , give him one more trial . She loved him  --  ah , God . he was sure of that ! And he loved her . He 'd make her realize it . Why , he 'd never stopped loving her for a single instant ! He 'd never see Mildredagain ; he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Peggy and the kids would pull up stakes and clear out of Port Washington , get away from New York , find a farm some place up in Connecticut where he could write and write and write . " Ah , Peggy  --  muggins  --  you must forgive me  --  you 've just got to ! " He almost ran the whole way home from the station , shakingwith eagerness and excitement . Oh , what had he been thinking of ? He 'd been sick  --  that was it  --  sick , mentally sick ! But now , now he was well again ! His house and the grounds about it looked so imposing and in such nice order as he hurried toward it . The old feeling of pride came back to him . It was an impressive looking place . He sprang up the front steps , burst open the door , flung his coat to the closet flour , glanced in turn into the sitting room , his study , the kitchen . All was in order , but nobody was about . He bounded upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The beds ' were made , the furniture in position , the tops of the bureaus bare , nothing out of place . There was not so much as a stray toy upon the floor . " Pegsy ! " he shouted . " Hi , Pegsy ! " Then it came to him the house was cold . He touched a radiator . There was no heat . He stood still , listening . Quietly , then , he descended the stairs , entered the kitchen , examined ice chest , storage closet , the shelves in the pantry . Returning , he went to his study . On the large blotter which covered the part of the desk where he wrote lay a key ring with the three keys to the house . Jingling them in his hand , he ascended the stairs again , and once more looked into all the rooms . Even the closet in Kate 's room was bare of clothes ; there were a few coarse hairpins and a spill of powder on the bureau top . The room Peggy had occupied was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . Ile noticed that even the bureau drawers and the shelves iii the closet had been freshly lined with white paper . A small picture of himself in a silver frame remained on her dressing table ; a larger one hung where it had always hung , beside her bed head . His own room was exactly as he had left it , his trousers hanging upside down  --  caught by their cuffs in the top drawer of his narrow chiffonier . Nowhere could he discover a note . He wandered back through the deserted rooms . Their silence frightened him ; their coldness caught at his marrow . On the floor of the room Janey had shared with the baby , a white object drew his eye . It was one of Dickey 's socks ; he remembered Peggy knitting it , and how she had debated putting a band of blue or a band of red around the top . He picked it up , studied it for a little , then gently crushed it in his palm and put it in his pocket .   THE smartly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took Bart 's hat. , coat , and stick , and in answer to his question said respectfully : " Mr. Henry Carter is waiting for you , sir ; he 's on the third floor . He told me to tell you to come right up as soon as you arrived . " There was an air about the Stanislaus Club . It was different from that which pervaded the Players , the Lambs , and the Lotus , where Bart belonged . Henry 's club was referred to sometimes as " the millionaires ' club , " and while it was true many rich men made up its membership , there was nothing ostentatious about it . Rather it was " elegant " ; Bart liked the word in its connection . He had been his brother 's guest there on two or three occasions and had always responded pleasantly to its atmosphere . Gill met him with a lean cordial hand as he stepped from the elevator cage . " Mighty glad you could come , Mr. Man . I was lonesome as the devil , so thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's nothing doing in New York on a rainy January afternoon . " Bart glanced at his brother 's lined , cadaverous face and  | thought he looked " liverish . " Golf , he knew , was what kept Gill in good physical trim , and this reflection suggested the question : " No Florida this winter ? " " It 's the damn market , " Gill replied ; " if the old thing would ever settle down and make up its mind what it was going to do , I could get away . I 'd like to go down to Nassau the end of this month ; that is , if Alice can be persuaded to forego Palm Beach . " " How is Alice ? ' Bart asked . " Oh , well . You know . Alice 's always the same , bored and tired . She wastes her energy doing the most ridiculous things . " " And Sylvia ? " Gill 's deeply creased face instantly lighted . " Ah , Sylvia ! " He put his chin in the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tell me , " Bart insisted , amused by his brother 's obvious satisfaction at the thought of his daughter . " Sylvia 's nineteen , " her father declared . He seemed to think he conveyed all that was necessary in the statement . Bart shook his head in despair . " You 're hopeless , " he said . " Well , let 's have a drink , " Gill suggested ; " if you really want to hear , I 'll tell you while he 's making it . " He started for the bar , but stopped upon encountering a fellow member . " Oh , Marcus  --  just a moment , old boy . I want you to meet my brother .... " A portly gentleman took Bart 's hand , and eyed him soberly from under bushy eyebrows . " Always glad to meet a friend of Henry Carter , " he said ponderously , " and particularly a brother " Gill interrupted : " I did n't stop you , Marc , just to shake hands with a brother of mine . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novelist ! " The bushy eyebrows went up , and the large plushy hand tightened its clasp . " My dear Mr. Carter , I 'm delighted . " He pumped Bart 's arm . " I read every blessed thing you write . That last  --  theP345title escapes me for a moment  --  was a corker , but my favorite will always be The Alccizar . God , there was a story ! I took all the family to see it when it was shown at the Strand . " Smiling perfunctorily , Bart nodded . He never knew quite what to say when people praised his stories . At the moment , another man , hurrying by , paused , hesitated , and touched Gill 's arm . " I say , Henry , " said this individual , " introduce me too , will you ? I 'm on my way to lunch with the wife , and it would please her , I 'm sure , if I told her I 'd just met your brother . " " You 're much admired in my familv , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " we all read you , front the youngsters up . " Bart threw an appealing look at Gill , who presently rescued him . While they were waiting for their cocktails , Bart . said : " I am awfully fed up on that sort of thing Oh , don'tmisunderstand me ; I 'd miss it if I did n't have it occasionally ; it 's all pleasant enough , but it embarrasses me . " " I get you , " Gill said , " but I had a little apple-polishing to do ; I thought it would n't hurt me to have Marcus Macaulay meet you ; he 's chairman of the board of the **26;584;TOOLONG ; I knew he 'd be pleased ; he 's a regular snob about writers . And the other man . . . . you know who he is ? " Bart pleaded ignorance . " He 's John Oliver Pringle , president of the Jefferson Trust . " As if impressed , Bart frowned and nodded . These successfulbusiness men meant little to him . He had never heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trust . It was all right for his brother to hold such men in esteem ; Gill was a Wall Street man himself , was " in the game , " appreciated the value of influential acquaintanceships . Bart was conscious of feeling fagged and was impatient for his cocktail . He smoothed his vest over his stomach and sighed . The previous evening he had gone to a stupid dinner where he had foolishly eaten and drunk injudiciously . When his man , Burns , had interrupted his morning work to say that Gill was on the telephone and wanted him for lunch , Bart had been of two minds about accepting ; now he devoutly wished he had declined . " Well , " he said apathetically , " you were going to tell me about Sylvia . " Gill waited a moment for the bar attendant to fill their glasses , then lifted his own , glancing over the top of it to catch his brother 's eye . " Here 's to her , " he said . Bart in two swallows emptied his glass . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please . " " We had fun while she was down for the holidays , " Gill went on . " I did n't know whether she 'd have engagements or not , so I mapped out a program for every day , but , bless my soul , the child was booked almost full . There were several dances , and she went to them all . My , my , Bart , you should see the way the boys flock after her ! They 're like bees after honey . But she can manage ' em ; you ought to see her ! " " Does she like Vassar ? It 's her second year there , is n't it ? " " Well-1-1  --  " Gill drew out the word  --  " she likes it as much as any normal girl likes college . She likes it for the good times she has there , but I suspect she does n't enjoy studying any too well . But , my , she 's lovely ! The sweetest thing you ever saw . She 's just beautiful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as I can see . " " I suppose she 'll be getting herself married soon to a son of one of your millionaire friends , and that will be the last you 'll see of her . " Gill smoothed his hollow cheeks . " Sylvia 's a bit different from most girls . She likes her daddy pretty well , and passed up several engagements just to spend an evening with me at the theater . Oh , I used to take her round to the night clubs Indeed I did ! " I want her to marry some day . I 'd like to see her marry young . There 'll be grandchildren , I hope . Oh , you can grin , " he said , as he observed Bart 's indulgent smile , " but I 'm nutty about children . " " You 're getting to be a fatuous old ass about your daughter , " Bart observed . " Perhaps , " Gill answered . " But you do n't know , Mr. Man ; Sylvia 's about all I live for ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aware his brother and Alice did not get on any too well together . Alice went in for society and trips to Europe . " I had a letter from Jack the other clay , " Gill announced . " Let 's go in and eat , and I 'll tell you what he said . " He preceded Bart to the spacious ( lining room . Down its center stretched a long , beautifully polished mahogany table , bright with sparkling silver . On either side , reaching down about midway , ranged a score or so of middle-aged men . " Shall we sit at the long table or take a small one by the window ? " Bart shrugged his indifference . " Let 's herd with the bunch , then ; there are nOt too many to-day . " As they proceeded toward two vacant places , Bart recognized Emil Renard , the critic and lecturer , and l larvey Kenyon , the same Harvey whom he had once known so intimately as a freight clerk in San Francisco , but now Harvey arvey Sheldon Kenyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the largest downtown banks . Fifteen years ago , soon after Bart and Peggy had moved to Long Island , he had met Harvey one day on the street and had asked him down to Port Washington for the weekend . Since then , Harvey had had a sky-rocketing career . His rise in finance and banking had been miraculously rapid . He had married into the Vanderventer family , had become a rotund , sedate personage , going in for philanthropy and charitable enterprises . Of late , Bart had met him on several occasions , always when he went to the Stanislaus , now and then in theater lobbies . They greeted each other cordially , but had , no opportunity to do more , although both were conscious of a desire to pick up the broken threads of their friendship . Bart nodded to Harvey and to Renard as he passed them , his attention being diverted by Gill introducing him to the men who sat nearest the places they were to occupy . " Doctor Scott , my brother , Bartholomew Carter ; Mr. Curtis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake hands with my brother .... " It was obvious Gill enjoyed this . He pronounced Bart 's name in a tone loud enough to carry to the rest of the table .   Bart was touched by his pride . In this atmosphere , the atmosphereof wealthy business men , he realized that his presence was considerably more of interest than if Marcus Macaulay , or the other man , the president of the Jefferson Trust , had appeared at the Players or the Lambs . Writers , actors , poets did not often pass the portals of the Stanislaus . He caught glances in his direction , heard his name whispered . Most of the men knew of him ; many had read his books . Their interestamused him . It neither flattered nor annoyed him . His food when it appeared was delicious  --  Gill invariably ordered with imagination and discretion  --  and the meal ended with a marvelous rice pudding . As his demi-tasse was served , Harvey Kenyon came to take the vacated seat next to him . " I wish we could get together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " been too many years since we did . I remember so pleasantlymy visit to your place on Long Island . That 's a long time ago , and a lot has happened since then . I 'd like to sit down and review the years . " Bart agreed with him . It taxed him somewhat to see in this partly bald , paunchy , sedate gentleman , the harum-scarum Harvey of " Abbey " days . His ready smile , his manner , a lurking twinkle in his eye were all that remained of the boy he had once known so well and of whom he had been so fond . " I 've followed your career with the greatest interest , " Harvey was saying ; . " I remember beginning your first story when it was serialized in a magazine  --  Crosby 's , was n't it ? " He leaned forward to talk to Gill . " You know , your brother and I used to be great cronies out in San Francisco ' bout the time of the fire . " " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We used to cut some pretty fancy capers in those days , " pursued Harvey ; " but they were n't vicious , were they , Bart ? Just youthful obstreperousness , eh ? " He seemed anxious for Bart to confirm this . Bart did . " I remember The Abbey . ' Great bunch of boys , were n't they ? " " Great bunch , " Bart admitted . " Wonder what 's become of them . "   " Made good in one way or another . Meet once a year , you know ; have reunion , an annual banquet on the anniversary of the fire . " , " Is that so ? Well  --  well ! I left San Francisco in 1908 . It 's twenty-two years since I saw California . Now , how about our getting together some night ? " His eye suddenly lighted ; he went on eagerly , " Say , you could n't dine with us to-night , could you ? Happen to be free ? Mrs. Kenyon and I would be delighted . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met abroad , Lady Fitzsoben and her ( laughter , the Honorable Constance -- most , most charming folk ! Come , wo n't you ? It will give Mrs. Kenyon and me such pleasure . " Bart hesitated and was lost . " Splendid , old fellow . An eminent novelist will add distinction . And  --  oh , I say  --  how stupid of me ! We shall expect Mrs. Carter , of course . I had such a delightful impression of her when I visited you at fort Washington . I 'm afraid Mrs. Kenyon will not have time to call , but I will see that she sends a note by messenger to her this afternoon . " " Mrs. Carter is in California , " Gill volunteered . Harvey 's face politely clouded . " Ah , well , that 's too bad , but we 'll expect you . Eight o'clock at 300 Park Avenue . After coffee , you and I will slip away together and catch up on everything . " He departed with a warm shake of Bart 's hand and a clap on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all your fault , " he said , aggrieved , to his brother . " My fault ? How you mean ? " " Oh , for bringing me here and exposing me to such bores . " " He 's an old friend of yours ! " " Perhaps , but that 's nearly twenty-five years ago . Now he 's married wealth , thinks wealth , exudes wealth . " " Sh-h-h , " Gill warned him , glancing about apprehensively . " ' Lady Fitzsoben , ' and the ' Honorable Constance , ' " Bartwent on miserably . " I know exactly how dreadful it 's goingto be . Why did n't I say ' no ' ? " " Oh , come , come , " Gill said . " Kenyon 's not so had , and his wife 's very much a personage . He 's a big man , one of thep350heavy backers of the Republican party . Everybody round here thought Hoover 'd send him to France when Herrick died . . .. " Emil Renard came up as Gill and Bart rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somebody-or-other  --  and next to ask if Bart would be his luncheon guest at the literary French circle to which he belonged ; the circle met on Tuesday . But Bart was not to be trapped a second time . He declined , hurriedly excusing himself , saying he had some telephoning to do . Some minutes later , the brothers found themselves in a quiet corner of the library on an upper floor , with some excellentHavanas Gill had provided . " You have n't told me what Jack had to say , " Bart prompted . " Ah , yes . Well , he 's thinking of taking a trip around the world . " " Trip around the world ? " " Yes ; he and Jane . Says he thinks he 'll have to sell the old ranch . " Bart frowned . Gill made an expressive gesture with his hands , letting his gaze follow the soft billowing smoke from his cigar . " Ile mentioned that Peggy does n't want to stay at Los Robles any more . " " Peggy does n't ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Japanese . My , my , they must be a nuisance ! The schools are flooded with them , jack says , and Peggy does n't want the  --  ah  --  your daughters to go there . How  --  how old are your girls now ? " Bart reflected . " Let me see , " he said ; " Janey was born in ' 14 . She 's  --  by God , she 's sixteen this month ! Margaret 's two years younger . " " Well , now that 's just it . I suppose they 're both in high school  --  I suppose Carterville boasts a high school ! Jack says some of the Japanese boys in the girls ' classes are twenty and twenty-two years old . Peggy does n't like it . " Bart , in turn , studied the curling smoke .   " Jack says , " Gill continued , " he might as well turn over what remains of Los Robles to the Japs and clear out . Jack 's pretty well fixed , I imagine . " " Yes ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town 's grown tremendously . Ile owns some nice business corners on the main street . . . . sold sonic of the ranch property , too . " " My God , " Bart commented dispassionately . I le thought of Los Robles as he remembered it as a boy , with the great sweep of range stretching ' from La Canada Heights on the east to barren Rincon do Konias on the west . He wondered where Peggy would take the children if Los Robles was sold . Gill answered his thoughts . " Your wife 's thinking of moving up to Palo Alto . " Bart was jolted out of his indifference . I le sat upright in his chair and turned sharp eyes upon his companion . Gill explained . " The boy 's going to Stanford University , is n't he ? Perhaps you did n't know that . " Yes , Bart did . He remembered now . His son had written almost a year ago that he intended to go to Stanford , had mentioned it again in a more recent letter . Dan had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board " exams " . .... So that was the plan ! Bart understood , now . The family 'd move to Palo Alto , rent a house there , Dan would enter Stanford , and the children attend public schools . " Jack says , if he sells the ranch , he and Jane may take a year 's cruise on the Adriatic . If he does n't sell it by the time Peggy 's ready to leave , he intends to travel anyhow . That will bring him here  --  if he comes this way !  --  sometime next fall - " My , my , " Gill broke off to add , " I have n't seen that twin brother of mine . . . . let 's see : I left California in 1905 . It 's all of twenty-five years ! Just think of it ! Course , Sylvia and Alice saw him and Jane in the summer of ' 27 . Sylvia liked all the family . " " She see Father Francis ? " " Oh , indeed yes , but the old boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had him in a sanitarium when she was out there , but she went to visit him a couple of times . Josh'sP352looking after him Yes , and she went to see Camilla andthat ineffectual book dealer she married  --  forget his name . " " How 're they getting along ? " Bart asked . " First rate , I believe . Think that 's what Sylvia told me . They have a nice little bookshop right in the heart of Los Angeles . She said Cam had beautiful snow-white hair . " " White hair , eh ? Why , how old is Cam now ? " " Pretty near sixty . She 's five years older than I am . That just about makes it . " You know , " Gill continued with an amused air , " it kind of tickled me , all this family stuff . Sylvia was quite keen on it when she went to California . Course , her mother high-hatted ' em all  --  but Sylvia got a real kick out of looking up the folks . " It kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have n't written to anybody back there  --  my , since I do n't know when !  --  and naturally all of ' em had forgotten that I was alive . And then Sylvia goes out there and says she 's old Gill 's daughter ! Well , it made some of ' em sit up and rub their eyes . I got a flock of letters all at once , telling me what a fine girl I had , and giving me all the latest family news . Course , Sylvia , the little devil , just did it to please me . She knew every one of ' em would write ; I suspect she put ' em up to it My , my , Bart , Sylvia 's a lovely child ! " " Did she happen to see Eva Ann or Tilly ? " " No , she did n't get around to them . Saw the boys , of course , and something of Trudie . Tells me Trudie 's husband has sort of gone off his head or something ; do n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big gun out there in the doctor line  --  has him in an institution , told her it was for observation , ' but I s'pect it something more than that . Course , Sylvia went down to the ranch . Motored over with her mother , I believe , from Del Monte . She saw Jack and Jane , and all your family . Says you 've got a great bunch of kids , Bart . " " Yes , guess I have , " Bart agreed tonelessly . " You do n't think you 'll ever patch up your difference with their mother ? " Bart slowly waved his cigar through the smoke before his face . " I did all I could , " he said . " You mean , when you were out there ? "  | " Yep . " " And she would n't take you back ? " " Would n't even see me . " Gill waited a moment . " What was all the trouble about ? " Bart blew out a thin plume of smoke and watched it balloon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , " he said dully . The other pulled his chin . " How long 's it been now ? " " Ten years . " " What happened when you were West ? " Again Bart paused . " As soon as I found out where she 'd gone , I followed . Went straight to San Francisco to see Father Francis and Josh . I talked things over with them . I told ' ' em everything , said I 'd do what I could to patch things up . I 'd agree to anything so long as she 'd take me hack . " " And they told you ? " " Oh , Father Francis went clown to Los Robles , spent a day and a night there , brought jack back with him . We four had it out . Peggy was hard as nails . Just would n't see me ; that was all there was to it . " " Did you write her ? " " Sure . But they all advised me to wait a while , urged me not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Guess there are n't many marriages that turn out happily , " Gill observed . Bart drew a quick inhalation and knocked the ashes from his cigar . " After that I went to Hollywood , where they were filmingmy first story , " he went on . " I spent six months there .... " Once more he let his words die away , and Gill allowed himto take his time . " Then , " Bart resumed slowly , " I came back here .... " His tone implied he was not clone , and Gill waited . " I went to Europe that summer , returned to New York in thefall , went again the following year , and that time stayed twoyears . I took a villa in Sicily . We lived at Taormina. " 354 SEEDBoth men were conscious of the plural pronoun . Neither spoke . " That was a funny mess Josephine got herself into last year , " Gill said , offering a new subject . " Was n't it ? " Bart agreed , matching his brother 's changed voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw what was in the papers . " " Jo 's become a r'arin ' , tearin ' feminist " ; Bart explained ; " calls herself a woman 's liberator ' ; inveighs against any kind of restriction affecting the liberty of women , believes they should have as much freedom as men . " " Well , do n't they ? " " Jo does n't think so . She 's rabid on the subject . Suppose that 's the result of her stay abroad . " " How long was she there ? " " Do n't know exactly . She lived in Vienna for awhile , then went to Berlin , where I believe she did some studying and taught English to a German doctor 's children . She finally obtaineda physician 's degree at the Brussels University Medical School . " A couple of years ago , she came back here and took up birth control , associating herself with the work of a birthcontrolclinic down on Fifteenth Street . That was the place the police raided last April . " Oh , somebody lodged a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give contraceptive advice when necessary for a patient 's health . Jo and her outfit were accused of handing out information indiscriminately . I do n't know who instigated the raid  --  do n't believe anybody does  --  unless CommissionerWhalen . . . " Anyway , the police swooped down on ' em one day , busted up the place , arrested Josephine , another woman doctor , and three nurses , herded them into the Black Maria , took them over to the West Twentieth Street Police Station , and then to the Jefferson Market Court . Jo telephoned me from there , and I went down and bailed her out for three hundred dollars . " " And the upshot ? " " Nothing . The judge discharged them all after a month of rowing and unpleasantness ; guess it was a pretty disagreeable experience all round . Jo was furious . "  | " How does she reconcile her views with Catholicity ? " " She does n't ; she says she 's emancipated from all that , wo n't call herself a Catholic any more because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself as a Deist ' , and is going about the country lecturing . She believes birth controlis the cure for most human ills . Last time I heard from her , she was in St. Louis , headed west . " " I do n't know as I think birth control 's such a good thing , " Gill observed . " It lets a lot of women get out of having childrenwho ought to bear them . Most women are scared to have a baby , or if they do and have a rotten time , they wo n't have another . It 's a terrible experience , I guess , to give birth to a child ; at the same time , if women did n't know how to prevent conception , they 'd have to have more children . Nature intended women to bear children , and it seems to me it does n't do a woman any good , nor society either , to monkey with Nature . " " What about women who have too many children ? " Bart asked . " Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one after another , ruined Eva Ann . Birth control would have saved her . That 's what Jo 's fighting for . " It 's only this , " Bart continued , as his brother did not reply , " women of means can get all the information they want from their family physician about how not to have children ; poor women ca n't , and they bring ruin on themselves and weak , sickly children into the world because they do n't know how to prevent it . " The trouble is they are ignorant ; they do n't know there is a way out . You see , Gill , there 's a federal statute , passed in 1873 , which forbids the mails being used for sending out informationregarding contraceptive methods . There 's a five hundreddollar fine and a jail sentence of five years . Most states have similar laws , and a doctor is liable to get himself into trouble if he gives birth-control advice . Such laws are a disgrace to our national intelligence , and the federal statute ought to be promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Congress is afraid , I suppose . Catholics and a great manypeople think it 's a good law . Some physicians approve of it . " " If the information was accessible to all , it might be bad for the country , " Gill hazarded . " There does n't seem to me there are as many children as there used to be . " " Take a look on the East Side or in the Italian quarter . " " Well , of course , but I was thinking of people we associate with . Our parents had nine of us ; there are n't many couples you and I know with more than one or two children . " " Ours is the very class that should have ' em ; not the illiterateand unhealthy riffraff down in the Ghetto ! " Bart said , with momentary heat . He scowled at his cigar . " It would save a lot of misery in many marriages , " he observed , after a little . The note of bitterness in his voice did not escape his brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gill offered , after a moment 's thought , " children are  --  I coined the phrase myself  --  old folks ' insurancefor happiness . The more a man and a woman put into children , I mean the more they invest in them when they 're young , the more joy and satisfaction they have in life when they themselves grow old . I 'm fifty-three , and I do n't know what I 'd do without Sylvia . I 'm not interested in women , my business more or less takes care of itself ; she 's all I 've got that makes life worth living to me . When I 'm sixty-three , she 'll be nearing thirty , having children of her own , giving me grandchildren . Kids keep a man young " Well , well , " he said with a brusque change in his voice , as if ashamed of these sentimental observations , " what 's your next book going to be ? " Bart drew breath . It took him a moment to shake off his depression . " Oh , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sort of plugging away at one of the usual romances . I do n't know as I 'll finish it . I 've all the money I need . There 's no particular urge for me to work . I want to tackle something along entirely different lines . " Say , Gill , " he broke off sharply to say , " I 'd like you to know this : I send Peggy and the children five hundred every month . I 'd make it twice that if she 'd let me . She wo n't accept a penny more , and Jack had a hard time persuading her to take even the five hundred . " About the next book , " he hurried on , forestalling comment , " I thought I 'd try my hand at something of old Spain , SpanishP357romance , you know  --  bull-fighters , muleteers , that sort of thing . I 've never been to Madrid or Seville . I thought I might take a run over there this year " " You ought to go pretty soon , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seville . My , it 's a sight ; you 'll remember it all your life . Alice , Sylvia , and I went in ' 22 . " " That was the year I was abroad . " " Yes , I know . I tried to locate you through the American Express in Paris , and then I saw in the Paris Herald you and .. .. well , it said ' Mr. and Mrs. '  --  were at the Excellsior in Rome . The damn issue was a month old , so I did n't know where you were by that time . " They came out of the club together about four o'clock and paused on its steps . Gill 's luxurious limousine rolled up and stopped , the chauffeur descended , obsequiously opening the car door . Gill glanced at the gray sky and felt the sharpness of the air with his shoulders . The day had turned cold , but the pavementsstill were glistening wet from the warm weather which had prevailed for the last few days . " Believe I 'll walk , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't a blessed thing to do when I get home . Alice shuts herself up in her room with her maid and God knows what other domestic  --  bathing , manicuring , and dressing herself . I sha n't see her till dinner time . Suppose you could n't come out and dine with us ? " Bart reminded him of the engagement with Kenyon . " But I 'll walk part way with you , " he offered . They started off in the direction of the Avenue . In the late Saturday afternoon , the streets were teeming with people . A steady stream of cars set in either direction along the north and south thoroughfares . Muddy water sprayed from their wheels , traffic signals alternately glowed red or green , here and there lights commenced t : illuminate the darkening interiors of shops and stores . A sense of bustle and good-nature pervaded the hurrying throngs , while noises rose in clamorous thunder , punctuated now and then by sharp , staccato notes.  | The two brothers were able to maintain but a desultory conversation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gauge their gait to theirs , were held up at corners and obliged almost to shout above the din . Gill , assertingthere was no pleasure in such progress , jumped into an empty taxi caught in the jam , calling back through its open window , as he seated himself , he would phone soon . Bart continuedalone . His thoughts were all of his brother as he bent his steps homeward . Gill was rated as an extremely successful man ; he was prominent in financial circles , a member of more than one good club , a director in several corporations ; yet , in some way , Bart felt he had missed the very things in life for which , since he had left Los Robles a raw boy of seventeen , he had striven so hard to attain . His wealth , his success had little value for him now ; his wife was estranged in every interest with the possible exception of the single one of Sylvia . Alice lived in a world of artificialities , spending her time in activities of no consequence , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer held him . Long ago he had been forced to relinquish his profitable connections with foreign governments , but he had made enough money out of these affiliations to be reckoned a millionaire . He had his money , his wife , his stone house on the Drive , his Rolls-Royce , his city and country clubs , but these no longer amused him . There remained golf , which Bart suspected he pursued principally as an agreeable form of killing time , and his daughter . It had been only within the last year or so , that Bart had resumed relations with Gill . The latter had made the advances , admitting frankly he was proud of Bart 's fame , was pleased to claim kinship . They had not much in common , having developedalong different lines , and now they had reached middleagewith points of view regarding life and society widely at variance . Bart had been drawn to Gill by sympathy for him . His brother was lonely , and except for his devotion to Sylvia , talked and acted like a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way he turned to Bart , with the latter 's fuller life and more engaging contacts , for companionshipand confidences . P359Bart was not at all sure what he thought of his brother . Since boyhood , Gill had lived solely for himself , cultivating profitablefriendships , improving his circumstances , ignoring obligations . Gill was an opportunist , dulling his ears , shutting his eyes to anything and everything not immediately of service to him . Having won all he desired , he had come to his fifties to find nothing left for which to strive . And then , unexpectedly and undeservedly , within the past two years , Sylvia had suddenlyblossomed forth , radiant and beautiful , filling her father 's life to overflowing , and this belated affection , the only really unselfish love he had ever known , had softened and humanized him . Pathetic figure though he was to-day , Bart was conscious of a definite reservation in regard to his respect for him . He could not banish the memory of the time when Gill had left his mother , brothers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early years of his own and Peggy 's struggle in New York when a friendly hand or an encouraging word would have done much to hearten and make things easy for them . Yet , withal , Bart was drawn to him . The older man reached out for companionship . The younger said to himself as he mounted the steps of the studio-apartment building in which he lived , perhaps he did Gill an injustice , perhaps the man had really changed at heart and had come to realize too late all that he had missed in life . He felt Gill 's need of him . P360HE OPENED the door with his latchkey . Burns , in the hallway , helped him remove his overcoat , took his hat and stick . " Mrs. Carter home , Burns ? " " No , sir ; Mrs. Carter 's still out . " Bart passed into the lofty studio . He loved this room ; he and Mildred had planned every detail of its furnishing . At one end was a tall , wide window of prismed glass and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gauze curtains which might be adjusted with a long bamboo pole ; at night the whole could be obliterated by thick folds of turquoise-blue velvet . A balcony ran along one side with a rather precipitous staircase leading from it to the studio floor , and on the side opposite the great window stood a hooded stone fireplace of noble proportionswhich projected ten feet into the room . A large oil by Matisse , smaller canvases of Cezanne , Picasso , and other moderns , and an Italian altar cloth of matchless gold needlework surrounded by a ( lark plush crimson border , covered the bare paneling of the fourth wall . There were a black ebony piano , rugs , leather and upholstered chairs of Italian design and workmanship , a carved chest , massive gilded cathedral candlesticks , a broad flat-topped desk near the window , an escritoire a century in age , and bookshelves  --  shelves high and low , laden with books , crammed with books , overflowing with books . Bart enjoyed its comfortable confusion . " My dear , it 's my room , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with its disorder . " I like it this way . It looks lived-in , used , and besides , it has the kind of atmosphere in which I can write . I never liked the spick-andspannessof the Taormina villa . " The north window was a pale , luminous square to-night , filling the studio with ghostly light and ghostly shadows . Burns P361drew together the velvet hangings , and Bart jerked the chains dangling to three bulbs of a jeweled lamp which stood on the cluttered desk . Instantly the room was transformed into one of dim beauty and romance , the shadows deepening , softening , warm tones touching kindly the surfaces of the heavy furniture , caressing their outlines , spreading like a gracious tide over the heavily rugged floor . In a small neat pile upon one of the extended slides of his desk lay the afternoon mail . Bart sank into his swivel chair , picked up his black-rimmed spectacles , fitted them to his ears . Invitations , a note from his publishers , one from a newspaper syndicate , other business communications  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Ie cast the rest aside and slit the claps of these last with a steel opener .

I got a chance to start but the coach pulled me out when he thought I was hurt . Dan is expecting to go to Stanford next fall . He has 13 college board credits and needs only 2 more but they are awfully strict up there . Guess I 'll go to Cow College at Cal . Uncle Jack says he thinks that 's the place for me .

Bart shut his eyes to visualize her for a moment ; she was fourteen , now . He held her letter beneath the lamp .   That was a very thoughtful present you picked out for me and .1 thank you for it most warmly . It is very much admiredby everyone who examines it . Jane and I have been having a great deal of fun lately with a marionette theater . Aunt Camilla sent her a book about marionettes for Christmas , and Uncle Jack had a little theater built for us according to the speffications in the book . It is darling and Mother and Aunt Jane have been helping us make the marionettes themselves . Dan wrote a play for us to give and we asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They want us to repeat it at school .

Jane says to give you her love and to say for her she will write soon . I join her in this affectionate message . Your loving daughter , MARGARET . P. S. We had a lovely Christmas . Aunt Tilly and Uncle Wyss came over from Guadalupe and brought Ted , Aggie and their Dan . Agatha is a nice girl and I like her very much , but Ted is a holy terror . He has a new shotgun . It is a Browning Automatic . Bart let the sheets of the letter drift slowly into his lap . He tried to imagine what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen months younger , Jane sixteen , Margaret fourteen , and Dickey , the baby , now a boy of twelve whom he would not know to-day ! He conjured up a picture of Los Robles , and thought of these boys and girls in the old place , roaming up and down the stairs , bounding in and out of the house . He wondered what room each occupied , and who had the little one with the sloping ceiling next to the roof . He saw again the generous sweeping circle of lawn , the bordering flowerP363beds and leafy laurels , the rambling old house with the green shutters which had so greatly improved its appearance ; he saw too the gnarled and twisted giant oak trees , the ivy-covered stump of the one that had died , the tall water tank on top of its steel tower , straddling the ranch 's office at its foot , and he saw the drooping line of ragged eucalyptus trees shedding leaves and bark upon the roofs of the cottages below , standing like stalwart sentinels guarding the homestead at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack buying a horse for his son ! Jack deciding the h y was to study Viticulture ! Jack ordering a marionette theater for his girls , tellingPeggy not to worry about the cost of a convent school ! Ah , she had been hard  --  was hard . She had punished him more severely than she knew ! And yet , thought Bart , gazing vacantly into the shadows of the big studio , he had no right to feel resentful toward her , not any more , not after his last fatal error , when he had asked her to divorce him ! He was carried back to the talk he had had with Father Francis , Josh , and Jack , , in San Francisco ten years ago . All had advised him to wait , telling him within a year , two at the most , Peggy was certain to relent , and Bart , repentant , had not been difficult to persuade , feeling that a time of probation was no more than he deserved . He had departed , determined to accept his sentence without protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervise the filming of The Hacienda . He had remained there for the rest of that year , until business and writing plans necessitated his return to New York . It was impossible not to meet Mildred . Crosby 's wanted his next serial ; he was obliged to confer with her . She understood definitely at the time the old intimacy was over , yet , as it became necessary to meet and talk with her about his plot , to seek her advice regarding details , he had gradually become aware of the old appeal , and in fear of his own weakness , he had abruptly sailed for England . There , in a delightful but lonely Sussex vicarage , he had settled clown until the weather turned and cold rains drove him for the winter to the slopesp364of Fiesole . He had written his sons and daughters during that time , sending them little gifts , postcards , an occasional souvenir . In the spring , once more in New York , he had written Peggy earnestly and humbly , reminding her his two years were up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail , he appealed to lather Francis and Jack , begging them to intercede for him , but both presently replied regretfully that Peggy still felt resentful , and all that either one of them had been able to get out of her was that she was n't ready yet . She had won happiness at last , she said , and feared Bart would take it away from her . Jack added , with well meant kindness , that he was filling Bart 's place to the best of his ability . Father Francis urged him to pray to the Holy Spirit . That summer , from sheer loneliness , he had gone back to Mildred . They had been conferring with regard to his work , seeing each other frequently , and an occasion came when it had seemed natural not to part for the night . Things had drifted along then ; his old affection had returned . She had been companionable , stimulating , amusing ; he had grown to depend upon her , while thoughts of Peggy and the children faded away . One day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about marriage . She referred to it with more and more frequency , urging upon him its importance to them both , insisting that her position was anomalous , a source of annoyance and humiliation to herself . Mr. Crosby was aware of their relations ; others in the office knew ; it was coming to be gossiped about generally .
