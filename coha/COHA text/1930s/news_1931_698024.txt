txt Twentytql0 state leaders have been asked by Gov . Warren E. Green to work out a relief program to meet the serious situation caused by drought , grasshoppers and low prices in the State . This relief commission was asked to convene July 30 at Huron , S. D. , " as a solemn duty for meeting the most serious situation ever confronted by our State in its recent history .

Widespread crop destruction , especially of corn , wheat and other small grains , will necessitate federal or state assistance from some source to enable the farmers to getthrough the winter , Mr. Anderson said , after a ' survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars in attempted control of grasshoppers has been unsuccessful .

The meeting to be held at Huron will endeavor to " work out and prepare recommendations for the best practical effort which our State may give . The contingency brings an occasion when South Dakota citizens may show their mettle . "
