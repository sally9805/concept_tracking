txt Senator Warren T. Thayer was confronted this afternoon with evidence adduced to show that he violated the law in 1927 and 1928 in accepting money from the Chasm Power Company to reimburse him ' self for expenditures incurred at village elections in Chateaugay , where he is a resident and a voter . This developed in cross-examination by Paul J. McCauley , counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee , in the investigation of the Senator 's relations with the Associated Gas and Electric Company . During the forenoon , Senator Thayer had been guided by his own counsel , former Senator Clayton R. Lusk , in direct testimony offered to explain compromising passages in letters he had written to officials of the Associated Gas and Electric Company during the years in question and his action upon legislation that came before the Senate and had been in the custody of the Senate Public Service Committee , of which he was chairman . Senator Thayer , who in 1925 had sold his franchiseless Chasm Power Company to Associated Gas and Electric , was active in both of the Chateaugay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for membership on the Village Board , one in favor of restoring to Associated Gas and Electric the lapsed franchise for the Chasm Power Company , a subsidiary , and the other opposed to it . Referring to testimony in which the Senator had told of running for village trustee , for the Assembly and subsequently for the State Senate , Mr. McCauley asked : " You had considerable experience in elections and were thoroughly familiar with the rules and regula-tions ? " " Fairly well , " Senator Thayer replied . Then Mr. McCauley laid before Senator Thayer a letter , dated March 28 , 1927 , and already in evidence , in which he had asked S. J. Magee , vice president of the Associated , if it would be all right for him to put into his March ( 1927 ) expense bill $400 spent by him in the village election , and also a bill made out to the Chasm Power Coin ' pany for thiS $400 . " You assume full responsibility for that bill ? " asked Mr. McCauley . " I do , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was paid and that at the time the Chasm Power Company was a corporation . The money , however , was actually received by Senator Thayer from Wallace E. Pierce , who had negotiated with him the sale of Chasm Power to the Associated . Asked if he knew that Mr. Pierce received the money from Chasm Power , Senator Thayer responded : " He has so testified , I understand . " At this point Mr. McCauley read into the record Section 44 of the Corporation Law , which makes expenditure of money by corporations for political purposes a misdemeanor , punishable oy imprisonment for one year or a fine of $1,000 , or both . He then took up the 1923 village election when Senator Thayer billed for $454 in election expenditures . The check in this instance was made payable to Mae Coggin , his secretary . The Senator testified that he was out of town and thought she deposited it in the bank for him . It had come in the same way , through Mr. Pierce . Senator Thayer admitted that he had been quite active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeches , adding : " I never made a speech In MY life . " Senator Thayer admitted having taken part in the selection of Arthur Fritz , local manager for the Sheffield Farms Company , as one of the candidates on ? the Chasm Power ticket in 1928 . He said he had thought that Mr. Fritz would be favorable to renewing the company 's franchise . " You yourself were actively interested in the affairs of the Sheffield Farms Company ? " asked Mr. McCauley . This question became the signal for the most strenuous verbal battle between opposing counsel in the hearing thus far , Mr. Lusk fighting to exclude this line of questioning and Mr. McCauley intimating that he would " connect it up " by testimony to be given by witnesses associated with the utility . Maintaining that he had a right to offer evidence which in his opinion indicated that Senator Thayer " may perhaps have been guilty of official misconduct in connection with that election , " Mr. McCauley said : " I am going to introduce checks which furnish irrefutable evidence that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . T take it that official misconduct as a Senator is not confined to this room right here . I take it that a public official 's duty extends beyond the door of the Senate chamber . " Senator William T. Byrne , chairman of the committee , finally ruled in favor of admitting the evidence and was sustained by a vote of the committee . Mr. McCauley then put in evidence a check from Sheffield Farms payable to W. T. Thayer &; Co. for $900 . Replying to questions , Senator Thayer said that he had been " friendly " with the Sheffield Farms people for years and done business with them , and that the check was for " two carloads of cement . " His firm is in the contracting business , doing much highway work in Northern New York . Senator Thayer testified that during the Summer after the 1928 village election he had been put on the Sheffield Farms payroll . Mr. Lusk moved to have all the Sheffield Farms testimony stricken out , but it was permitted to stand . Defense of Letter to Magee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thayer the latrer 's letter to S. J. Magee of the Associated Gas and Electric Company in which he said : " I hope my work during the past session was satisfactory to you , not so much for the new legislation enacted , but from the fact that many detrimental bills which were introduced we were able to kill in my committee . " " What did you mean by that ? " asked Mr. Lusk . " What difference did it make whether it was satisfactory to his company or not ? " " It makes a lot of difference , " said Senator Thayer . " Up in the district I represent there are a great many . employes , there are also a great many bondholders or stockholders in that association or company and my experience has been , from the political angle , that those hundreds of employes and bondholders know real well what the feeling is of the organization that they work for , and it assisted me materially in my coming campaign .
