Obscured by all the bong and glitter of pre-Coronation , a quiet little scene took place in Britain 's High Court last week which may vitally affect the future of Anglo-Italian relations , possibly the peace of Europe . <P> In purple on the bench sat the Hon.

Before him was a case in which stockholders of Haile Selassie 's defunct Bank of Ethiopia were attempting to regain possession of certain securities , admittedly held by the National Bank of Egypt in Cairo , against the Italian-appointed liquidator of the Bank of Ethiopia , one Wladimiro Liguori . Plaintiffs brought in evidence a decree signed by Emperor Haile Selassie from his exile at Bath . <P> Ruled Justice Clauson : " Last December the British Government recognized the Italian Government as in fact the Government of the area then under Italian control . The effect of Great Britain 's de facto recognition is that I am bound to treat the acts of the Government which was so recognized as acts which can not be impugned . ' ' Referring to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not imagine any ground on which it could seriously be argued that I could pay any attention to it . " <P> The plaintiffs , in other words , might whistle for their money , but the judgment meant more .
