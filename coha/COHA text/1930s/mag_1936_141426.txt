Threading his way through congested Sunday traffic near Chicago last week , many a motorist with an automobile radio heard a voice interrupt the program with such comments as : " All motorists from Joliet bound for points east of Hammond should use U. S. Highway No. 6 to avoid a detour on Route No. 30 between New Lenox and Frankfort . " <P> This advice came from a large transport plane circling over Cook County . In it , getting a bird 's eye view of the area , were a county highway chief and a local judge . When either of them spotted a traffic jam below or detected excessive road friction due to accident or highway construction , he spoke into a short-wave radio transmitter , ordered police-squad automobiles to the spot or offered advice directly to motorists by means of a rebroadcast by Station WBBM . <P> So pleased were the two officials by the results of the new traffic control method that they announced it would be used every Sunday until the end of summer .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
