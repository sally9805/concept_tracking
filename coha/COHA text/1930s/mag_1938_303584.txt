Bitterly protesting its injustice , President David Lasser of the Workers Alliance ( WPAsters ' union ) last week heeded the " warning " of Chairman Sheppard of the Senate Campaign Expenditures committee , dropped plans to collect a $50,000 political campaign fund from WPA workers . But , said Mr. Lasser , voluntary contributions from friends of the Alliance would be accepted and , with its dues income , put to the Alliance 's political ends . He wrote to Senator Sheppard : <P> " You know full well that the campaign against us in the press , encouraged and abetted by your ' warning , ' has reached new heights of unprincipled slander . You know perfectly well that the charges that we intended to ' coerce , ' ' mace ' or ' shake down ' the WPA workers are without an iota of justification in fact . "
