Last week Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey filed a registration statement for an $85,000,000 issue of 25-year debentures with a 3% coupon-a record low for a long-term industrial bond . Biggest oil company in the U. S. with assets of $1,894,000,000 , Standard Oil thus demonstrated that its credit is nearly as good as that of the U. S. Government . One sound reason for that credit rating was revealed at the time the registration was filed : Last year Standard Oil earned $62,800,000 , a fat increase over the $45,600,000 reported in 1934 and an astonishing recovery from 1932 when profits amounted to precisely 1 per share . <P> Proceeds of the new bond issue will be used to retire the outstanding preferred stock of Standard Oil Export Corp. , which was formed in 1928 under the Webb Act to handle the combined export business of Standard Oil and three subsidiaries . A non-profit organization , Export has only 100 shares of common stock , 40 owned by Standard Oil of New Jersey , 30 by Humble Oil &; Refining , 25 by Standard of Louisiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co . Export 's owners paid all expenses , guaranteed the big preferred stock issues . However , the new bonds are a direct obligation of parent Standard of New Jersey . <P> Also revealed in the registration statement was the fact that President Walter Teagle got a raise last year , his salary having been boosted from $112,500 to $125,000 . More notable was the fact that Chairman Teagle discovered that a registration statement could be used for a sounding board . In those sections of the statement where a company has to record any known facts or conditions likely to affect the company adversely , Standard Oil unburdened itself of a long harangue on the subject of taxes , which because rates are changed every year are " an unpredictable item in the budget . "
