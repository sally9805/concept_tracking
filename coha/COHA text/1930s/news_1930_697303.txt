txt Price movements on the Stock Exchange yesterday reflected restoration of the bull leadership , which the market has lacked since midApril . Baying closed last week in new high ground on the current recovery at 2/20.23. compared with the previous rally top of 226 34 on June 30 , industrials used in the Dov. ? - Jones averages provided a strong technical indication that the line of least resistance had swung around to the upside . This suggestion brought a substantial A CCU .. Ululation of buying orders over the V. eek-end and new highs on the present advance were reached by the principal trading stocks in the early dealings . Brisk demand was in evidence for Steel , General Electric , American C. Allied Chemical . Union Carbide . Atchison . New York Central , American Telephone , North American , and Consolidated Gas . ? ? ? Against the background of impressive strength in high-grade pool stocks , pool oper- ations flourished in special shares . Vigorous demonstrations were staged in Vanadium . Standard of New Jersey . Radio-Keith. and Loaves Durant interests , who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the latter issue . Group work in individual issues was attributable mostly to prominent speculators rather than to influential banking interests . But the latter were reported to be cooperating to the extent of affording liberal credit a.ccominodations for such activities . That plentiful funds were available on stock market collateral was evident from the state of the demand loan market . where the rate dropped to 2%. from the renewal charge of SS ? with accomodations outside available at slight concessions . ? ? ? Radio-Keith was a feature of outstanding strength , displaying great activity at the best levels of the movement . A large turnover in the stock was attributed to the operations of a group headed by M. J. Meehan , who returned from Europe Saturday . Radio-Keith 's earnings in the second quarter will probably be disappointing in common with those of other film producers . Company started the year well , with net profit of around $1 a share in the first three months . However , earnings in the second quarter probably fall considerably below this figure . Radio-Keith was shooting at mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment it seems doubtful if this total will be approached unless a sharp upturn in profits takes place during the last half of the year . Interests currently sponsoring the stock , however , feel that RadioKeith 's possibilities in the industry give it greater speculative attraction than any other leading motion picture concern . ? ? Along with Steel and American Can , Union Carbide has stood out in the principal industrial class on the substantial recovery from the recent lows . Having rallied more than 10 points from the year 's low of 60SS . Carbide has kept pace , practically point for point , with therebound in Steel . Excellent long-pull accumulation of Carbide has been induced by the company 's ability to maintain its earning power without great impairment in a period of general depression . Company 's report for the second quarter seems likely to approximate closely the showing for the first three months this year . In the latter period , the balance for the stock was 72 cents a share , compared with 87 cents on 8% less stock in the initial quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has shown from 2 to 19 cents less per share in the second quarter than in the first , excepting in the abnormally prosperous 1929 period . Then a gain of 1 cent took place in the second quarter . Hence , if the report for the second quarter of 1930 is well up to the showing for the first three months . it will be particularly satisfactory . Over the last five years . Union Carbide has earned from 58% to 62% of its annual earnings during the final six months . As a result , it is estimated that even though the company is able to score only seasonal improvement in business during the last half of 1930 , it should report a balance of about 53.50 a share for the full year . This would compare with dividend requirements of $2.60 a share . Current yield on the stock is above that afforded by some seasoned dividend shares such as General Electric , International Harvester and National Biscuit . This factor has given stimulus to investment buying of Union Carbide . ? Private wires from Detroit estimate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter as compared with both the first quarter of this year and the second quarter of 1929 . These estimates place the company 's net for the three months at about $1.25 a share on 2.000,000 shares of stock , which would compare with 38 cents a share in the first quarter and 50 cents a share in the second quarter of 1929 . For the first six months indicated earnings may amount to as much as $165 a share , against $1.20 in the same period of 1929 . Good profits are explained by the heavy volume of Ford body business which Briggs has been doing this year . ? ? ? Appreciation of the potentialities of the hydrogenation process , in the use of which the major American refiners will participate through their holding of shares in Hydro Patents Co. , with which the patents to the process in the United States now rest , was reflected in the market action of the oil group . The process , which is owned by Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey and the I. G. Farbenindustrie of Germany , holds out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance in oil refining . ? ? ? Action of the Tin Producers ' Association in bringing about world wide curtailment of production in order to decrease stocks and increase the price of raw tin is of particular interest to American industry which consumes practically one-half of all the tin produced , according to Dominick &; Dominick . Though a number or large producers commenced curtailing their operations several months ago , the official restriction sponsored by the Tin Producers ' Association did not take effect until July 1 . It is expected that the world 's visible supply of tin , which is now well in excess of 35,000 tons , will be reduced to between 15,000 and 20,000 tons by January 1 , 1931 . Tin production increased from 142,894 tons in 1926 to 190,163 tons in 1929 , while during the same period consumption increased from 141,993 tons to 176,985 tons . On the basis of last January 's output , world production , if uncontrolled . would have amounted to approximately 212,000 tons this year , while world consumption for 1930 , as estimated on the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , is computed at 10% below that of 1929. or about 160.000 tons . Decrease of American consumption is principally due to the slackening of demand on the part of the automobile manufacturers who use 20% of American imports , since cat manufacturers who use 60% of imports are maintaining a volume of business equal to that of a year ago . Spot tin is at present selling for about 30 cents a pound in New ' York as compared with an average price of 65.30 cents in 1926 , 64.37 cents in 1927 , 50.46 cents in 1928 and 45.19 cents in 1929.
