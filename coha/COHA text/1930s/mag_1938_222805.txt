For 85 years some of the world 's most lurid , blood-curdling " true-story " prison tales have come out of experiences , real and embellished , gained in France 's famed penal colony in French Guiana , on the northeast coast of South America . Horror stories deluxe have told of men working stark naked in the sizzling tropical jungle , of lust , greed , murder , homosexuality in prison cages crammed with killers , rapists , thieves . Other tales have told of years of maddening isolation in " bear pits " on one of the three Iles du Salut ( variously translated as " Safety Isles " and " Isles of Salvation ' ' ) , ten to twelve miles off the mainland . <P> France 's unsentimental penologists have remained singularly unimpressed by these horror stories . Two years ago , however , France 's Popular Front Government started to do something about the penal colony . Last week Premier Edouard Daladier by decree prescribed a slow death for it . No more prisoners are to be sent there , but on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be repatriated . Since the convicts die at the rate of about 500 a year , it will take about ten years to liquidate the penal colony . <P> Most of French Guiana 's chroniclers have followed a pat formula . The story usually starts with the teller being convicted of a felony . In a temporary prison at the citadel of St. Martin-de-R , in the Bay of Biscay , the convict awaits the sailing of the plodding 3,800-ton " hellship " La Martinire , formerly a German freighter , now outfitted with steel-girded cells and mutiny-suppressing hot-steam hose . Into her hold go Foreign Legion deserters , Algerian Spahis convicted of rape , French Indo-Chinese murderers , Circassian thieves , arch-crooks from Montmartre . The ship arrives in 50 or 60 days at St. Laurent , on the Maroni River dividing Surinam* and French Guiana , where after another brief internment , most convicts are assigned to a prison at Cayenne or Kourou or to any one of numerous jungle camps along the river . <P> Of the 5,000 prisoners in the colony 4,500 never leave the mainland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may be sent to one of the Iles du Salut , high , rocky , mile-long Ile Royale , and there set at hard labor , perhaps even put in an isolated pit . If considered a mental case he may enter a madman 's cell , on Ile St. Joseph . If he has been convicted of treason , he will probably be sent to live in a hut on the most famous of this trio of islands-the 34-acre , bleak Il du Diable , or Devil 's Island . Not more than 25 traitors to France have generally inhabited Devil 's Island at one time . Currently only five or six exiles live on the island . So publicized was the case of the first prisoner on Devil 's Island , the martyred Captain Alfred Dreyfus , that the entire French Guiana penal colony commonly takes the name of the tiny island . <P> Because of swift currents and shark-infested waters , escape from Devil 's Island-until 1895 a leper colony-is considered impossible , has never succeeded . From the mainland , however , escape in Small open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some distant friendly shore is not only possible but , judging from the number of successful attempts , a rigorous yet comparatively easy undertaking .
