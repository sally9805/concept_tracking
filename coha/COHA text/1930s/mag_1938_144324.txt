Every man who ever fumed about the phone bill had reason last week to be pleased . Every man accustomed to getting $9 a share in annual dividends on his American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. common stock had reason to be anxious . For , in the most far-reaching and drastic report of its kind ever submitted to Congress , Federal Communications Commissioner Paul Walker recommended that telephone rates be cut 25% , and that FCC be given more absolute control over A. T. &; T. than any Government agency has ever held over any U. S. industry except in time of war . <P> Commissioner Walker 's 1,100 pages of indictment and proposals are the result of three years ' investigation . They would still be the Commission 's secret had not the Commission learned that communication circles had somehow " tapped its wires . " Rather than give A. T. &; T. a chance to prepare a counterpunch while FCC studied the report , lively little Chairman Frank R. McNinch decided to make Commissioner Walker 's findings public at once . But he specifically told Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but is instead a report submitted to the Commission and is now being studied by the members of the Commission with a view to subsequent determination , at the earliest practicable date , as to the form and content of the report which the Commission will later submit to the Congress . " <P> Commissioner Walker 's major premise is that , because of A. T. &; T. 's system of cost accounting and its relations with its manufacturing subsidiary , Western Electric Co. , its costs are far too high and could be reduced enough to bring telephone rates down 25% " without interrupting existing net earnings . " Other Walker assertions and proposals : <P> " Failure to deduct depreciation reserves in arriving at rate base values has permitted the Bell System to earn a return on amounts far in excess of the investment made by the owners . " Rates should be based on the " prudent investment " theory espoused by Franklin Roosevelt . <P> " The Bell System has successfully evaded effective State regulation , despite the separate corporate entities of the operating subsidiaries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for purposes of profit , and as a group of separate corporate legal entities for purposes of regulation . " A. T. &; T. is a utility and a monopoly and should therefore be regulated by the Government . <P> Western Electric is " the manufacturing and supply department of the Bell System , having a monopolistic position comparable to that of the American company and partaking of all the attributes of a public utility . ... " The Bell System pays Western Electric unnecessarily large prices for telephone equipment and apparatus . These costs should be reduced as the major means to cutting telephone rates . <P> The Bell System has held patents and improvements , such as the modern handset , in abeyance for years in order to avoid huge losses on equipment in hand . <P> Large executive pensions should be drastically reduced . <P> Cost of institutional advertising should be borne by the stockholders , who benefit by it , instead of by the telephone subscribers , who pay for it now through their bills .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
