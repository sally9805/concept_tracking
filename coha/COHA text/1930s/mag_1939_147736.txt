The viola is in nature an undersized pansy . In art it is an oversized violin with a tubby , whiskey-contralto voice . Except for low-moaning the inner voices of symphonies and string quartets , it is not good for much . Most of the time it merely plays pah to the cello 's oom . Most of the people who pull horsehair bows over its goatgut strings are ex-violinists who failed to make the grade . <P> No such second-grader is athletic , tooth-brush-mustached William Primrose , who plays the principal viola part in Arturo Toscanini 's NBC Symphony . Last week Primrose temporarily added himself to the world-famed Budapest Quartet ( TIME , Nov. 13 ) to play quintets for Manhattan 's persnickety New Friends of Music . <P> He had also just completed 20 solo records for Victor , and the Primrose Quartet , of which he is boss and viola player , had just muscled in on the front rank of U. S. chamber-music organizations . For him a half-dozen of the world 's leading composers ( including Paul Hindemith , Ralph Vaughan Williams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viola sonatas , viola concertos . <P> When he was a little boy in Glasgow 30 years ago William Primrose loved to saw away at an old viola that was around the house . His father , who was himself a disappointed viola player , strongly objected , set little William to practicing the violin instead . But William never forgot the charms of the forbidden viola . Years later , in Brussels , when his teacher , the late great violinist and tosspot Eugene YsaYe , told William he had special aptitude for the viola , he switched to it for life . In 1937 , when NBC officials were recruiting their new NBC Symphony , they heard a phonograph record of Violist Primrose playing a Paganini caprice . Never had they heard or heard tell of such fast &; fluent viola playing , at first thought some super-brilliant violinist like Jascha Heifetz had made the record under an assumed name . They telegraphed Primrose , then on tour with the London String Quartet , and offered him the job of Toscanini 's chief viola player . He accepted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sissy . His evenings are spent , not at musical tea parties , but at Manhattan 's Madison Square Garden . Once a good boxer himself , still an avid connoisseur of right hooks and straight lefts , he no longer dares to get into the ring for fear of hurting his hands . Today , Primrose is generally considered the world 's finest viola player . No longer does he have to play one-night stands , traipsing through snowdrifts to theatres and hotels in out-of-the-way Canadian and Midwestern towns . He reaches a bigger audience in one concert than he could in 15 years of barnstorming , and without any more discomfort than it takes to step from a subway into a cozy broadcasting studio . " It makes you feel like an orchid , " says William Primrose.
