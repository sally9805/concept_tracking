One year ago Mrs. Lucius William Nieman died , leaving Harvard University most of the fortune her husband mined from the Milwaukee Journal . With her bequest Harvard was " to promote and elevate the standards of journalism . " Three distant relatives shortly declared that the 75-year-old lady was mentally unsound when she drew her testament four days before she died . They brought her nurse to court to testify that some nights Mrs. Nieman " would drink half a bottle ( of gin ) , some nights a full bottle . . . . " No one could guess why Mrs. Nieman wanted Harvard to have her money , reputedly $5,000,000 , and even Harvard 's President James Bryant Conant shied off a bit , firm in the conviction that Harvard wanted no journalism school . <P> Off to a singularly bad start , Mrs. Nieman 's plan last week came through to a finish heartily acclaimed by educators and press . Having mulled over the Nieman worry with leading publishers and editors , President Conant announced the novel Nieman Fellowship plan which falls well within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1,000,000 after taxes had been paid . With the $40,000 income Harvard will set up 15 annual Nieman Fellowships to be awarded to working newspapermen on leave of absence for an academic year ( or half year ) of Harvard study in any field they choose . <P> Three members of the Harvard Board of Overseers will administer the fellowships : John Stewart Bryan , scholarly publisher of the Richmond News Leader , president of the College of William and Mary and former president of the American Newspaper Publishers Association , chairman ; Editor Ellery Sedgwick of Atlantic Monthly ; New York Herald Tribune 's Walter Lippmann . They and a handful of Harvard professors will select from each of the nation 's six great regions at least one man . Only prerequisites : three years ' experience , a Godspeed from the boss , a thirst for knowledge . When they go back to their jobs they will presumably be better equipped to serve them and their communities , generally raise the tone of the working press . <P> The Herald Tribune informally canvassed staffmen on what each would study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Economics , 24 ; U. S. History , 2 ; English Composition , 3 ; English Literature , 1 ; Spanish , 1 ; Zoology , 1 ; Mathematics , 1 ; Business Management , 1 ; Ethics , 1 .
