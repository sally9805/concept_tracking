txt The Finnish delegation returned to Moscow this morning  --  headed by Dr. Juho K. Paasikivi and composed as before , with the addition of R. Hakkarainen , Finnish Chief of Protocol . The members were met at the railroad station at 10:30 A. M. by Vladimir Barkoff , Soviet Chief of Protocol , and the Swedish , Norwegian and Danish Ministers . It was decided that there would be no meeting with Joseph Stalin and Premier Vyacheslaff Molotoff today as the delegation was busy preparing a translation of final documents . The Finns this evening attended as spectators , accompanied by Mr. Barkoff , the session of the Supreme Soviet , which was devoted to a reception of the White Russian delegation from the former Polish White Russian region . Information from Helsinki indicates that the Finns are bringing with them their final offer , and apparently they are now willing to meet the Soviet Union to a considerable extent concerning demands for the cession of territory that Moscow claims is essential for the defense of Leningrad . Finns Not Wholly Yielding It is believed Finland is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further to meet the Soviet Union on the question of the cession of territory in the extreme north of Finland . What the Finns apparently feel unable to do ? virtually destroy their independence ? is to lease the port of Hangoe to the Soviet Government for the establishment of a Soviet base there . Rather than do this the Finns would prefer to fight . A Moscow broadcast intercepted in London this morning said that Finnish Foreign Minister Eljas Erkko in his speech Wednesday had " delivered an open threat of war against the Soviet Union , " according to a United Press dispatch . The broadcast also said that comments in Finnish newspapers on Premier Molotoff 's address to the Supreme Soviet were of a " hostile nature . " Despite the alarming character of passages in Premier Molotoff 's speech to the Supreme Soviet , in regard to Finland , the Finns seem to believe the Soviet Union will 4ecognize the extent of their concessions as generous and conclude a peaceful agreement rather than proceed to extremes . There has been constant contact since their arrival between members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Scandinavian circles generally every one is looking toward Sweden for an indication of her final attitude , for it is felt unlikely that she has yet said her last word . Norwegians , Finns and Danes alike feel that Sweden is at a turning point in her history . A definite decision by Sweden to maintain under all circumstances the solidarity of the Scandinavian bloc , it is felt , would stabilize the situation and definitely avert any possibility of a conflict . Most other Scandinavians and many Swedes feel that Sweden must recognize that cession of Han- goe to the Soviet Union would place Russia in a position to dominate the entrance to the Gulf of Bothnia . Although Russia has wisely refrained from alarming Sweden by making demands at the present juncture for the Aland Islands , it is felt in Scandinavian circles that once Hangoe became a great Soviet naval base it would place the Aland Islands at Russia 's mercy . Finland has today 400,000 men under arms in a position to defend the country and apparently is determined at the last resort to offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanized forces and airplanes , there seems to be an absolute conviction in Finland that she could put up prolonged resistance , especially with the Northern Winter at hand  --  the most unfavorable period for military operations in the region . But the crushing of her resistance could be only a matter of time . Norway and Sweden Watch Both Norway and Sweden would then find the conquering Red Armies along their frontiers , exactly opposite the points where the most valuable ircn ore deposits of both those Scandinavian countries are situated . Norway has never forgotten the dream of the Czars to establish a port on the Northern Norwegian coastline . Sweden is already nervous despite the scrupulous correctness of the Soviet Union 's attitude toward her so far as actual demands are concerned today in regard to the position of Gotland Island , should the Soviet Union obtain a dominant position on the Finnish mainland . The Swedish people have a long and honorable record of freedom from warlike conflicts . In a sense it may be said that they have been " too proud to fight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their neutrality in the last war . But in Swedish circles the question seems now to be viewed as whether Sweden may not be obliged at the last moment to take the lead in the Scandinavian bloc of four nations and give , if not an open , then a discreet , warning to the Soviet Union that Sweden stands definitely for the integrity of the Scandinavian mainland , including Finland . Sweden could easily put 650,000 men in the field . Her air force is weak , as is her navy , but she has an excellently trained army and first-class artillery and she produces probably the best anti-aircraft gun in the world . Without Denmark , the Scandinavian countries are in a position to put about 1,000,000 men in the field . They have never indulged in extravagant boasting but have always been most modest about their military capabilities . But today the situation is so serious that Finland has informed all her neighbors , including Russia , that all her coastline is mined and all her ports closed , except Helsinki and Turku . Possibilities of a Conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suppose that there is any intention on the part of the Soviet Union to commit any act of aggression against Finland . On the contrary , the readiness Russia has shown so far to negotiate with Finland doubtless will be maintained . But should an agreement fail to be reached th ? . re are possibilities of a conflict which may well involve the whole of Scandinavia and even spread much further . The situation is being adroitly exploited by Germany to get the Scandinavian countries to support her campaign against the British blockade of the Reich . Toward Scandinavians Germany 's attitude is that it is better to follow the line the Reich lays down for them against Britain if they expect Germany to check possible demands of the Soviet Union upon them , while to Britain and France the Nazi attitude is that they would do well to accept the view that Nazi Germany is less dangerous than the " Bolshevist peril . " In other words , Germany is intimating that she is prepared to pull down the whole capitalist house of cards and give the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deprive her of her European conquests and force her to liberate enslaved nations cease . It is hardly likely , however , that Scandinavian countries set much value on any of the German insinuations that it is in Germany 's power to restrain Russia , with the object lesson of Finland in view . Finland must bear a heavy share of responsibility for the collapse last Spring and Summer of the endeavors to create a peace front , for she was then in the forefront of the opposition of the Baltic States to Anglo-French-Soviet guarantees  --  preferring in her fears of Russia to put her reliance upon Nazi Germany , who has now abandoned Finland to her fate . cept an arrangement aimed at protecting the safety of Leningrad and the Gulf of Finland . This point was taken up by newspapers , which with commendable objectivity discuss the aspirations of the Soviet Union , far-reaching though they may he , but make it perfectly clear that Finland intends on no account to surrender territory vital to her integrity and neutrality . For this reason , the Soviet claim to Hangoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finnish mainland for naval bases will be unreservedly rejected . Moreover , a Russian naval establishment at Hangoe would in no way add to the safety of Leningrad , which the Soviet Government earlier declared to be sufficiently safeguarded by the acquisition of bases on Estonia 's Dagoe and Oesel Islands . The strong reaction to a demand for Hangoe in Sweden is taken to indicate that Sweden realizes the danger of the presence of a Soviet naval and air base so near her coast . It could easily serve as a substitute to the whole northern policy of freeing alone , without Swedish participation . Hangoe represents the key for the Aland Islands , which Russia dom and neutrality and not merely a vital factor in Finland 's independence . For this reason the Finnish nation will not yield on this point . A demand for the Finnish part of Rybachi Peninsula in the Arctic is held here to be another indication that the Soviet Union 's " safety " program is not devoid of wide imperialist aspirations . From that section the Soviet Government could control Finland 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make an important channel for her foreign trade . Finland is unable to understand how this could help safeguard Leningrad , 1,000 miles away . Finns Stick to Program Wireless to THE NEW Yonx TIMES . HELSINKI , Finland , Nov. 2 ? It was generally assumed here tonight that the negotiations in Moscow would bring decisive results since Dr. Juho Paasikivi had definite instructions from the Finnish Government and the whole matter under discussion had been thoroughly ventilated . Premier Vyacheslaff Molotoff 's precipitate presentation of the Soviet demands  --  shock though it may have been  --  cleared the atmosphere for an exact evaluation of the position and its implications after too long a period of rumors and guessing . The opportunity was quickly grasped both by Foreign Minister Eljas Erkko of Finland in his speech of last night and by most newspapers here today to analyze , with certain restrictions , the main points of Mr. Molotoff 's address . Mr. Erkko made a strong appeal to the country by his declaration that Finland was prepared to ac            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
