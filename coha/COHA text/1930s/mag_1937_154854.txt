Before a battery of cameras in the office of Owner Horace Stoneham of the New York Giants one day last fortnight , Manager William Harold Terry tore up his fat contract which still had a year to run , signed a new one for five years upping his salary to a reported $40,000 a year , highest current in the major leagues . One day last week Manager Charles Dressen of the Cincinnati Reds quietly walked into the office of Owner Powel Crosley Jr. , quietly walked out again without any contract at all . It was no coincidence that the Giants had just slipped into first place in the National League and the Reds had just slumped into last place . With both major leagues entering the home stretch of their pennant races and fans already looking forward to the World Series a fortnight off , owners , players , and above all , managers , were looking backward with mingled satisfaction and rue as their six-month season drew to a close . <P> National League .

Frank Frisch 's St. Louis Cardinals , generally rated to finish first in pre-season prognostications , had managed to stay in the first division , not so much by the pitching of famed Dizzy Dean as by the performance of the season 's outstanding batter , Outfielder Joe Medwick. whose average of .375 last week was leading the league . Easygoing Harold ( " Pie " ) Traynor 's Pittsburgh Pirates , after a runaway lead during the month of May , seemed likely to finish fourth . <P> Surprise team of the National League was Bill McKechnie 's Boston Bees , who had decisively beaten both the Giants and the Cubs the past month and were still knocking at the door of the first division last week , despite the team 's dependence on material recruited from the minor leagues . For their showing Boston credited Manager McKechnie 's shrewd choice of two " old rookies , " Pitchers Jim Turner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games respectively this season , simply providing a fresh demonstration of the axiom that 30 is the best age for a pitcher . Competing with Charley Dressen 's Reds for the tail end position were Jim Wilson 's Philadelphia Phillies , with Burleigh Grimes 's Brooklyn Dodgers just escaping the ignominy of the cellar .
