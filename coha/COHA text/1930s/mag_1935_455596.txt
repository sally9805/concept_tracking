BETWEEN July 5 , when the Revolutionary government in Hankow fell and I said good-bye to Rayna Prohme , and September 18 , when I went up the steps of the Metropole Hotel in Moscow , a profound change had taken place in the texture and organization of my mind with respect to all the subjects brought together in these articles . To put such complicated processes into words is difficult to the point of impossibility : the words are gross with implications , refusing , as often as not , to bear their own exact meanings ; it is too late in the history of a heterogeneous language to strip any word quite clean . But , as nearly as I can define it , the change had consisted in a steady , orderly concentration of thought and feeling within this cycle of experience ? to which I have given the name revolution ' ? and , concurrently but less precisely , within the subsidiary or preparatory cycles outside it , upon a single phenomenon containing the principles of energy diffused ( but neither organized nor put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the sun of this solar system ? was Rayna Prohme . During the weeks after the fall of Hankow , when her fate as a human creature ( as Human Being Number Eight Trillion or so ) was seriously disturbing my molecular activityas another member of the same series , her essential principle was taking its natural place at the centre of my world of ideas ; the first process was minute , demands the microscope , and has no important place in a narrative that is not concerned with strictly private matters ; but the second process , for which the telescope is the appropriate instrument , involved every fragment of material within my experience of life or view of the world . When I turned from the hall porter 's desk at the Metropole and saw her coming toward me the process was already completed , but it needed that moment of blinding significance to become irrevocable . I have never known a moment like it . For six weeks I had imagined her dead , torn into pieces by a mob , broken and sunk in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of torture , in some dreary and forgotten Chinese field . These morbid fancies had alternated with others in which I imagined meeting her again , but it had never been wholly credible to me that I might find her , alive and well , by the mere effort of going to Moscow . And yet here she was , coming swiftly across the hall , laughing , hands stretched out , her eyes alight beneath the conflagration of her hair . A stab of joy , a flood of relief , and a tempest of excitement , all tools less time than it takes to write the two syllables of her name ? Idayna . This being so , I must face the problem of stating , as clearly as possible , the nature of our relationship then and afterward . It was not a sexual relationship ? at least not as the phrase is currently understood . Neither in words nor in gestures did it take the forms of intimacy known to the readers of a thousand erotic novels . I shall not attempt to explain the mystery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it existed . If these words fall under the eyes of a reader who can not believe such a thing possible , he had better stop reading at once , for it will be assumed from here onward that the fact is plain . Anti from that moment of reunion onward it was impossible to seek the relationships that seemed necessary to life ( a relation of one to many , a place in the chain of cause and effect ) without reference to this solar phenomenon , this sun perceived , lost , and found again , a focus of reality for which the only solid expression was a slip of a girl with red hair . The issues that converged for me upon her fiery head were the most serious any human being has to face , and they converged there , most of all , because she had faced them first . When I said , in the account of our meeting in IIankow , that we were inescapably magnetized toward the same pole of reality , I was describing a state of things that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met in the hall of the Metropole , she had already moved so far toward that pole as to become part of its immediate radiation . The problems of minor movement no longer counted for her ; they had been solved ; she had reached her centre . If we define this central reality as the meaning ( orconviction of meaning ) in the existence of an individual , his sense of exact position with respect to the multitudinous life of his species in its physical environment , it may be seen that , for persons like ourselves , it had to be the whole thing , the sum of good . I say ' for persons like ourselves , ' because there existed other kinds of persons unmagnetized to any central reality ? willing to expend their allotment of time without attempting to relate it to the time of which it was a segment ? and still other kinds contented in this necessity by the easy promises of supernatural religion and the immortality of the soul . A settled polarity was harder to establish for persons like ourselves because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but once reached ( as she had reached it ) it gave the only satisfaction that could inform a life and last it out . These were the processes that had supervened upon the separation in Hankow for the two of us . She had reached her central reality ( which was also mine ) and become part of it . As she came across the hall of the Metro-pole I knew that my world revolved about her . If this sounds like the language of sexual or romantic attachment it is the fault of the words , so hard to dig out pure from their tangle of associations ; but in simple fact it was not so . The feeble , perfumed sentiments , the romantic illusions , the limited personal desires and disappointments of boudoir ' love ' had no part in the moment ( it was a moment sharp as a dagger ) ; nor did they afterward influence the course of our related systems of thought and feeling in the spiral plunge to catastrophe . This tragedy may have contained love , but if so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal emotions are capable , related to the whole life of mankind and the eternal effort of the FINALE IN MOSCOW human spirit to find its own place in the universe . She came across the hall , I turned and met her , and we both laughed . ' I knew you 'd turn up , ' she said . ' I expected you any day . ' III For the next week everything in Moscow took its place for me as a subsidiary part of the continuous conversation with Rayna Prohme . It was a conversation in which no debate was possible . Fresh from China , imbued with the feelings and ideas of Hankow as they had been strengthened by the opposition of Peking , I lord no desire to attack the decisions she had made . They seemed to me the best decisions . She was going to continue her work for the Chinese revolutionary movement as long as it was required , but when ? as she foresaw clearly ? the parts of that movement would disintegrate , sending its vital element underground and leaving its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a direct part in the work of the forbidden and secret organization . She had decided that life was not possible for her on any other terms : that she could not bear the spectacle of the world under its present arrangements , and that her place was within the organisms struggling to upset and rearrange it . This necessity was not wholly the result of social or economic theory ; although she had a solid basis of training in the social sciences and was convinced of her solutions ( the Leninist solutions ) ; a deeper necessity had driven her onward . She felt a genuine relationship to all forms of human life . That was the essence of it . To her the Chinese coolie was another part of the whole life , rich , various , cruel , and immense , that she shared to the extent of her limits in space and time . She could not see a Chinese coolie beaten and half-starved , reduced to the level of the beasts , without feeling herself also beaten and half-starved , degraded and oppressed ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind and spirit ) was inflexibly resolved , by now , never to lie dmvn under the monstrous system of the world . She was ? to use Gerald Heard 's word ? ' co-conscious ' with all other parts of the human race . Man 's inhumanity to man seemed to her a great deal more than that ; it was an inhumanity of one part of the same body to another . The Shanghai entrepreneurs who employed thousands of Chinese men , women , and children at starvation wages for twelve and fourteen hours a clay were , to her , like the hands of a body cutting off its legs . Capitalism , imperialism , individualism , were more abhorrent than cannibalism , but had the same inner character . They differed from cannibalism in being more universal and more difficult to correct . I had not her purity or courage , and could not feel these things with her clean , deep sureness . But I did feel them . As I have said , she had now reached her centre and was sure ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once more complex and less integrated than she . Often my first feelings had to be chastened ; hers were clear at once . Her individual impulses had been , by now , so subjugated and harmonized by her intelligence that the conflict was over : sire was unified , integrated , and burned with a pure white flame . She was prepared for any sacrifice , up to and including death itself ; petty questions ( among which she included her personal destiny ) could not disturb her any more . It was a marvelously pure flame , and even though I clearly could not hope to share its incandescence , it seemed to me that I must hover as near it as possible . Nothing else I had ever seen gave the same light and heat . I decided to spend the winter in Moscow . The immediate problem was ( of course ) one of money : I had earned large sums and spent them in the past year , and the only way of getting through a winter in Moscow was to find editors or publishers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily arranged in Moscow itself , where cablegrams were expensive and letters slow . It was possible ( if at all ) only by going to London . IV- How can I characterize the clash of influences that filled every minute of the next three weeks in England ? I was like a fish that had learned to walk on dry land for six months , and now was plunged back into the ocean again ; I was like a valley farmer inured to life on the top of a mountain , only to be thrown back into his lush native field when he could no longer till it . I found all my English friends unchanged ; the pleasures of the mind and body , the agreeable diversions and preoccupations of modern Western life in the cultured upper class , had not undergone the slightest modification in all this time . These people were so sure of themselves , so accustomed to viewing the spectacle of the world without a direct interest in it , that they could discuss even the terrible alternatives of revolution with cool intellectual curiosity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them . England ? in spite of the General Strike of the year before ? seemed as far from a genuine revolutionary situation as ever . Revolution was a melodramatic word without significance in these green fields and spacious houses , where any subject could be discussed and all subjects were of equal interest . The crippling thing ? the really disastrous thing ? was that my friends in England were more intelligent andbetter educated than myself . I might feel that I was right , that the moment in which we all lived presented a breathless intensity of meaning , that a decision was necessary if we were not to perish , but I could never prove it . They all knew too much for me , were too cool and logical and altogether superior to such alternatives . On one occasion I was so exasperated by a long argument in which I had been rather badly worsted that I took to baser weapons and pounded a friend of mine ( it was Raymond Mortimer ) with my fists , shouting , ' You damned intellectuals have no blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however inevitable , was naturally taken by all present as proving the very thing I was most concerned to disprove : the illogical and emotional nature of the revolutionary thesis . I seemed more than a little eccentric to my English acquaintances just then , for their intellectual frigidity only drove me by reaction into excesses of statement and feeling . For a good part of the time I must have behaved ( by any bourgeois standard ) insufferably badly . I remember once when I went so far that a glazed look came into every English eye in the neighborhood . I was staying with the Nicolsons at Long Barn , and another of their guests was Mrs. Nicolson 's cousin , Eddy Sackville-West , the heir of Knole . The devotion of all members of the Sack-vine family to that monumental house , which sits in the midst of its lovely park like a visible history of the race that made it , was as well known to me as to anybody present , but I forgot the fact when Harold Nicolson ( prompted by his familiar imp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionary government , or a Soviet government , or a proletarian dictatorship , do with a house like Knole ? Specifically let 's take Knole , and leave the others out . What would a revolution do to it ? ' The question seemed very interesting , and I answered it at length . The special value of Knole was architectural and historical , I said , and would be so recognized by any revolutionary government . It had no value as a health resort or home for workmen , for it was neither healthy nor properly arranged for such purposes ; it would not , therefore , be converted to other uses , but would almost certainly become what it was , in fact , to-day ? a museum of the history and taste of the English aristocracy from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries . Such a museum would find its best guardians and interpreters in the people who knew it best ? in fact , in Eddy Sackville-West and Vita Nicol-son , who could usefully become its curators . Only when this speech had come to an end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Nicolson recovered first , and joined in the sudden laugh that turned the subject off , but I thought for a moment that her cousin was going to have a crise . I knew him only slightly then , and ought to have refrained from disposing of his house ( not to speak of his own future ) so cavalierly ; but I had got into the habit , in the past six or seven months , of stating any idea as clearly as I knew how , with no nonsense about good taste or the behavior of ' gentlemen . ' It seemed to me that the whole trouble with the upper classes , so far as I knew anything about them , was that they were afflicted by too much good taste and too many superstitions about being ladies and gentlemen ' to form a correct idea of the materials of life . My temper of mind was ? after six months of China and a week in Moscow ? so different from theirs that their conventions and training , which obviously helped to make their company agreeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , of course , can be guessed by anybody who has endured to the present point in this story : it was a defense . I was angry and alarmed , on arriving in London , to discover that the old world of comfort , pleasure , taste , diversion , and amusement still powerfully appealed to me ; that the misery of nine tenths of the human race could seem dim and distant when considered from the midst of a well-supplied bourgeois dining room ; that the things a Bolshevik a working Bolshevik , like Rayna or Borodin ? had to give up were things I valued . This material seductiveness of the bourgeois world was strengthened by an attack on the revolutionary idea itself : I was always having J. M. Keynes quoted at me , and being told that the waste of life and wealth ( that is , productive machinery ) incidental to revolutions was uneconomic . My English friends , who were not themselves doing a thing to bring about the social rearrangement , always assured me that the rearrangement would take place ; only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orderly , democratic fashion under the parliamentary tradition . They pointed to their own advanced social legislation ? unemployment insurance , death duties and income taxes scaled up to attack accumulations of capital , their pension system and the rest ? as a proof of the capacity of a capitalist state to submit to orderly , progressive reformation . That these arrangements were , after all , at the mercy of political accident , and that the so-called ' social legislation ' of bourgeois governments could not possibly protect the workers against the results of such crises as war , overproduction , and speculation ( the characteristic crises of capitalism , according to the Marxist view ) , were objections ruled out by the Englishmen I knew with a succinct phrase : ' You want too much . ' They believed in their own ability , or their race 's ability , to achieve the desired ends by the methods of democracy , which , they believed , were ' slow but sure . ' Little as I felt this to be the essential truth , I was for-. ever being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own mind , however strongly I protested , that there was a lot in what they said . The sum of all my impressions on that visit to England would have meant nothing at all to Rayna or to Borodin . They were certain ; their political philosophy never deserted them ; they knew the economic bases of English upper-class life too well ever to be charmed by its graces . But I was ( intellectually at least ) far from certain . The process by which my desire for integration had become involved with , and centred upon , Rayna Prohme was not a purely intellectual process , or it could never have been affected by any amount of bourgeois charm . I remained convinced that the issue of revolution was the only genuine issue ( the only ' live option , ' as William James would have said ) in the world I lived in , but my own position with respect to the revolutionary struggle was more dubious and uncertain than ever . The effect of England upon rne , at a moment so critical , was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowed me up , made me waver and ask questions . The questions England suggested were personal ones . They went something like this : Why should you , a bourgeois born and bred , leading an externally agreeable life under the bourgeois system of society , try to do anything to change it ? What does it matter to you if Chinese coolies starve to death , if boys go into the coal mines of Lancashire at the age of twelve , if girls in Germany die by the hundred fromtuberculosis and occupational diseases in the chemical factories ? What do you care if the steel workers in Pennsylvania are maintained in conditions of life equivalent to slavery ? Ca n't you forget about all that ? You 'll probably never starve ; you can earn enough money with your silly little stories to lead a pleasant life ; why not do so ? You think revolution is inevitable , ? or say you do , ? and why not , then , leave it to other people ? workmen , soldiers , Bolsheviks ? It 's their business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Are you prepared to give up all the pleasures of modern Western culture , everything from good food to Bach and Stravinsky , to work for the welfare of other people 's grandchildren in a world you will never see ? The answer was , decidedly , no . That was what England had done for me in the short space of twenty-one days . I went to Berlin at the end of October and stayed long enough to complete my arrangements for the winter in Moscow . I was as ' revolutionary ' in conversation as ever , but I knew that I did not possess the spirit of self-abnegation required to follow Rayna Prohme hi the course that now lay before her . Her letters during October had shown an increasing determination in her purposes . She was on the point of entering the Communist Party ? not lightly or fashionably , as young men do in Paris and London , but with the intention of sacrificing her entire personal existence to its service . The whole thing made me unimaginably gloomy , and I could not foresee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did know one thing : that I most make the most valiant attempt to save her , as a person , from absorption into the machine of the Party or the Kornintern . I no longer cared if this seemed the effort of a vulgar , selfish , lazy , and cowardly bourgeois , for England had persuaded me that I was not a Bolshevik and never could be one . The leopard can not change his spots . Harold Nicolson put inc on the train in Berlin and Rayna met me at the station in Moscow . That was the kind of journey it was : not only a space-journey ? not even primarily a space-journey , although the stations succeeded each other through Germany , Poland , and Russia with measured accuracy ; it was an idea-journey , a trajectory between two worlds . The train drew in to the October Station in Moscow before noon on November 7 , and Rayna 's fiery hair was the first thing I saw on the platform . I had been away from Moscow ? far away from Moscow ? for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days that followed I was beset by indefinite and torturing premonitions . They were not correct , ? what premonitions are ? ? but they were near enough to what did happen to assume ? even at this distance in time ? an awful significance . I engaged in a desperate struggle , from that first day onward , to keep Rayna from , joining the Communist Party . Of all the contradictions of the ' , cried , this was perhaps the worst . The pure flame that gave such light and heat ? what was it ? The centre toward which I was magnetized , the focus of the world as I saw it , was Rayon Prohme as revolutionary ; it was not revolution alone and it was not Rayna Prohnse alone , but Rayna Prohme integrated and set alight by her pure conviction . This was , in fact , my reason for being in Moscow . And yet from the nsoment I arrived I fought tooth and nail to get her assay from her own essential centre ? to recall her , by fair means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep on living . When I use such strong words ? desperate ' and ' tooth and nail ' ? mean everything they mean , and more . For six days and nights the struggle conthmed with hardly a respite . Her room was on the other side of my sitting room , in the adjoining apartment , and when either of us thought of a new argument we kicked on the wall ; in two minutes ? the time required to take down the innumerable barricades of iron , wood , and steel put up by my timorous landlady ? we had met and started all over again . We talked until four or five o'clock in the morning sometimes , and the argument was forever renewed , never brought to an end . We neither of no got much sleep , but I was as strong as an ox and did not realize what a terrible strain the whole thing was on her nervous system . No matter how bitterly I may have regretted all this afterward , it is the fact . When her physical fragility impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as an argument . She had been having severe headaches for months , and they had lately grown more frequent ; aspirin and phenacetin did not help them ; sometimes in the midst of the argument a dazed stare would come into her eyes and she would say : Wait a minute . I must just he quiet for a minute ; it 's the headache again . ' When it passed , I used to ask her how she proposed to endure the rigors of life as an active revolutionary when her physical resources were so limited . This particular argument had no immediate effect . She would laugh and say : ' In or out of a revolution , I 've got to die sometime , and what does it matter ? ' Her disregard of her own personal destiny was so complete that nothing I could think of made an impression upon it . The arguments that did reach her were the general ones , those directed at the idea of revolution itself ; and one of the most effective of these was the one I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the opinions of J. M. Keynes as shown in his recent booklet about Russia . I telegraphed to London for that booklet , but it never arrived . It would be foolish to maintain that there was nothing selfish and personal in all this . There seas . I have said that in September I already felt that I could not live without the light and heat that came from this extraordinary flame . In September I had had no doubts ; I would have followed her into the Lenin Institute , into the Communist Party , to Korea or Japan or anywhere . In October I had been forced to reconsider ; I saw , too clearly , my own inadequacies for such a life . In November I was no longer willing to follow her , even in mind , but struggled instead to bring her back from the certainty in which she dwelt to the easier world where men did not die for their beliefs ? where they did not , in fact , have any beliefs if they could help it . This endeavor was selfish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a feeling that Rayna Prohme as a completed revolutionary instrument ( in a year 's time , let us say ) would be a stranger to the lazy bourgeois I had recently rediscovered . She would be lost to me and to my world ; in the sense of a bourgeois individuality she would be lost altogether , for her intentions were , even for a Communist , extreme . She had decided to join the Party and enter the Lenin Institute to be trained as a revolutionary instrument . When she had completed her training she was to take service in one of the revolutionary organizations , probably in the Pacific Labor Bureau to begin with , perhaps afterward in direct work for the Komintern . Her special qualification coincided with her own desire , and she would be sure to be sent to the Far East . No decision in life could be more final . The vows of a nun , the oaths ofmatrimony , the resolutions of a soldier giving battle , had not the irrevocable character of this decision . Rayna was not taking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wills revolutionary work , and knew what she was doing . Nothing I could bring up about the nature of the work or its effects made the slightest difference to her , for I found that she had considered it all before . I was reduced , again and again , to the simplest forms of impotent argument ? attacks upon the emotional nature of the revolutionary , attacks upon Rayna 's personal structure . Of course the truth is , ' I would say , that you derive a personal thrill out of the idea of being a revolutionary worker . It 's sheer romanticism . Far more exciting than going home to Chicago and listening to symphony concerts ! That 's the truth of it . Whether the idea of revolution is correct or not does n't matter ; you 've got to have your thrill . ' I never said a thing like this without realizing at once how miserably specious and vulgar it was ; but when I had exhausted all the legitimate arguments I could think of , wild stabs were the only form of attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process too thoroughly to be disturbed by it ; she knew that a remark of the kind was only a confession of weakness , of exhaustion , and , however weary she might be herself , she never failed to laugh . That laugh was generally accompanied by a polite admonition to use a little rudimentary intelligence , put into this form : ' Do n't be a damned fool , Jimmy . ' After seven crowded years this advice sounds as plain and recent as if it had been delivered ten minutes ago . I do not pretend to have acted upon it consistently or even most of the time , but at certain important moments , without preparation in thought or association of ideas , it has suddenly broken through every surrounding circumstance and rung again in my ears , tone and accent and laugh and all , like an actual voice . VII On Friday , November II , we argued almost all night long . It was the last argument . At the end of it , when every element in the problem , personal and general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rayna 's resolution WaS still unshaken , we said good-bye  --  not too solemnly , of course ; there was always some lightness in Rayna 's spirit ; she could always laugh , even though it was not altogether easy . It was the kind of good-bye I can scarcely explain unless it is instantly apparent . We were to meet again the next day , but in the essential sense it was good-bye just the same . She was to go to the Lenin Institute on the following Monday , and I was going to leave Moscow as soon as I could bear to do so . I asked her to do one trivial thing for me ( I do not know what I hoped to prove by it ) . This was to dress on the following night in the golden dress from China that Soong Ching-ling had given her , to wear Bill 's amber necklace , and to dine with me in the most flagrant luxury Moscow had to offer , at the Grand Hotel ( Bolshaya Moskovskaya ) . This was before the Five-Year Plan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ( I believe ) it was afterward , a luxurious establishment for foreigners . Moscow 's most bourgeois place just then was the old Grand hotel , where most of tiro foreign visitors lived . Since my arrival in Moscow , throughout this week 's argument , Rayna had worn the same dress ? wadded green silk dress in Chinese style , the warmest she possessed . We had taken our meals either at the cheap cafe underneath the Metropoleor in workmen 's coiMemtives , where we could cat for very little , as neither of us had any money . I wanted one bourgeois evening ' for myself , for the sheer pleasure of it , and to see her once more in that gold dress ; but it is possible that I also hoped ( madness , of course ) that silk and flowers , music and white wine from the south , might accomplish what I had failed to do , and bring her back a little way toward the world she had been born into and was now surrendering forever . 0 . K. , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gold dress , I can tell you , but if I can borrow an overcoat and run like hell when we get out in the street , I 'll do it . You shall have your bourgeois evening , but it wo n't make any difference . ' On the next day ( Saturday , November 12 ) she went to see Dorothy Thompson at the Bolshaya Moskovskaya and fainted in Dorothy 's room . This seemed a little alarming , but by that night it had been forgotten . I feel absolutely grand to-night , ' she said . Silly of me to faint like that , but I do feel better now than I have for days . I think I 'm going to enjoy the bourgeois evening . ' SI . looked ? as she said she felt ? grand . She was only a thin slip of a girl , with no particular stature or figure or conventional beauty , but her appearance was at all times lighted up by her expressive eyes and the glory of her hair . The red-brown-gold of her short curls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore the gold dress from China . It was cut severe and straight , Manchu style , with a collar , and was made of very plain silk the color of dull gold . We went to the Bolshaya Moskovskaya and had our bourgeois evening . We even danced ? twice . Dorothy Thompson came and sat with us and I told her what was happening . She seemed a little startled and incredulous . ' You understand what it is ? ' I said . ' It ' s the end of Rayna Prohme . No more Rayna . Finished . Revolutionary Instrument Number 257,849 . ' The truth of what I was saying was too much to bear quietly just then , and I turned toward Rayna and pounded her thin shoulders in the Chinese dress . The end of Rayna Prohme , ' I said . The end of Rayna Prohme . ' She moved away , threw back her fiery head , and laughed . It 's the end even of Revolutionary Instrument Number So-and-So , ' she said , ' if you do n't stop beating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anyway ? ' The dinner , the gold dress , the certainty of the decision , the gloom of Moscow , the Napareuli wine and vodka , all together had operated to destroy my common sense that night . Even when I was not saying it , I was thinking it , and I said it often enough : ' The end of Rayna Prolnne : That night seemed as final as death itself . VIII I slept late the next day ( Sunday , November 13 ) , and walked slowly across to the Metropole in the afternoon to see if Rayna was there . ( The . Chinese Revolutionaries still had a small office there in which she worked when there was work to do . ) As I came up the steps of the hotel , just where I had met Rayna on that evening almost exactly two months before , I ran into the American correspondent , Anna Louise Strong , and a little Chinese Communist called Chang Ke . Rayna had saved Chang Xe 's life in Peking in 1926 by concealing him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . ' Mrs. Prohme is very ill , ' Chang Ke said in his flat , emotionless voice . ' She 's at the Europe , ' Anna Louisesaid , ' and apparently she 's fainted . Chang Ke came to get me . We 'll have to bring her back here and put her in my room for a while . ' I went along with them to the Hotel de l'Europe , a small hotel about a square and a half away from the Metropole . Chang Ke led us up the stairs here to a small room , the anteroom to the part of the hotel occupied by the Chinese Labor Delegation . One or two Chinese were sitting there quietly , and Rayna was lying unconscious on a couch . I picked her up and carried her downstairs and through the streets . She weighed nothing ; it was like carrying a child . Once she recovered consciousness enough to speak , asked if she was heavy , and tried to stand up . The people in the streets stared a little and then hurried along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there Raynor recovered enough to sit up in the lift and apologize for having fainted . But before we got to Anna Louise 's room on the top floor she was gone again . I was no good to Anna Louise in taking care of Rayna , and had nothing to do but walk about the town and wait for the doctor . Hours passed before the doctor came . Rayna had recovered consciousness , wholly or partly , and lay silent in the darkened room . Toward evening the ' neighborhood doctor , ' a weary Russian with two assistants and an incredible amount of paraphernalia , arrived and set to work . These gentlemen took possession of the room and started to unpack all their tubes and packs and appliances , which cluttered up the whole floor . I was asked to leave , and did not return for an hour . By this time Rayna was sleeping fitfully , and I learned that she had been given ether ? which , as by chance I happened to know , made her deathly sick . For the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought she should be taken at once to the Kremlin Hospital , and Anna Louise agreed with me , but nothing could be done without the Borodins , and I could not find them . On the next day Moscow was covered deep in snow . It was bitter cold . I reached the Metropole in a state of unnamable terror , only to find Rayna quite rational and able to laugh again . She had passed a dreadful night and was very weak , but she blamed it on the ether . We moved her to a room of her own , and after Dr. Linck 's visit she became cheerful again . ( Dr. Linck was the German Embassy 's doctor , whom I had called in . ) As she felt better the curtains were pulled back and the room grew light . Many people came to see her ? Madame Sun Vatsen , Borodin , Chang Ke , Scott Nearing , Louis Fischer , and others . They spoke of plans , and what seemed to me the most hopeful thing of all ? the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame Sun 's going to the United States . If she did this she wanted Rayna to go with her , and for two or three days in the middle of that week , in spite of the steady gravity in Dr. Linck 's eyes when I talked to him , I convinced myself that all the problems could be solved at last . The week of November 73 was actually less difficult to get through than the previous week had been . Dr. Linek had forbidden political discussion of any kind in Rayna 's room , and had made her promise that she would obey his orders . This ukase brought out the patient 's laughter . Will you tell me , ' she said , poking at her pillows , ' what on earth anybody ' d ever talk about in Moscow if political discussion was forbidden ? What do you suppose we can talk about ? I ca n't remember any other subjects ! ' We found the other subjects readily enough , and throughout the week those conversations ? never political ? were , however difficult it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight . We talked about everything under the sun except politics . She told me long stories about her childhood in Chicago and about her scapegrace younger brother whom she loved . I was never there in the mornings , and when I came in the afternoon she always had a budget of visits to tell me about . I had never seen Rayna in better spirits than she was that Friday . We must have talked all afternoon and most of the night . Often I wanted to stop talking and let her rest , but she felt better than she had felt for a long time , and it amused her to lie there and recall a thousand stories of her early life , most of which were new and very funny to me . Her first husband ( the New York playwright , Raphael-son , known as Rapp ' ) figured in these stories , as did her young brother and her sister Grace . They were all characters out of a past I did not know , the period before she had gone to China . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned once . That was when she suddenly recalled Eugene Chen 's good-bye to her in Peking two years before . He had said at the door of their office , just as he was about to take wing for Canton : ' The Revolution is grateful , ' and then , magnificently , The Kuomintang never forgets ! ' We both laughed helplessly at this reminiscence . She also talked a good deal about Bill Prohme , now thousands of miles away in Manila , to whom her affection and loyalty had been constant always . She even dictated a letter to him in which she said she was a little under the weather , but would be all right soon . That night her illness took a turn for the worse , and although none of us yet knew what it was , its seriousness could no longer be concealed . She passed a bad night and was forbidden visitors in the morning . When I was left alone with her for the afternoon on Saturday she spoke to me in a very low voice . I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks I am losing my mind , ' she said , ' and that is the worst thing of all . He wo n't say so , but that is what he thinks . I can tell by the way ho holds matches in front of my eyes and tests my responses . He does n't think I can focus on anything . ' She had spoken vaguely of this fear before , and all I could do was say that I did not believe it was well founded . But on the next day ( Sunday , November 20 ) she felt certain that this was the case , and it kept her silent and almost afraid to speak , even to me . I sat beside her hour after hour in the dark , silent room , and the blackness pressed down and in upon us . Two or three times she raised her voice to say , Do n't tell anybody . ' I knew that this meant her fear that her mind was attacked , and I promised not to tell . Later in the afternoon We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal I had made some days before ? that when she was able to travel she should go to Germany for treatment . Toward night she said I 'll go to sleep for a while now , and when I wake up we can send a cablegram to Raph . ' I never heard her speak again . Dr. Linek came in the evening and said that a professional nurse must be put on duty at once . The nurse came and sat . Sonya and Vep , two Russian friends who had helped care for her , remained for most of the night in the little anteroom , and Anna Louise returned , too . The place was kept in complete darkness and silence . I was dazed with horror and felt absolutely nothing throughout the night . I came and went ; walked in the Red Square ; went to the Bolshaya Moskovskaya and drank vodka ; returned to the Metropole from time to time to speak to Sonya . During the night Rayna woke up once and asked Sonya for me , but I was across the square . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had wanted me , I suppose , to send the cablegram . On his last visit the doctor said : The process I have foreseen has begun . It must take its course . ' Although I heard these words quite clearly , and they were translated to me by Anna Louise afterward , they still did not carry their obvious meaning to my dazed intelligence . At three or four in the morning I went around the corner to the Savoy Hotel ( where I had moved on the day after Rayna 's illness began ) and went to bed . At seven o'clock that morning ( it was Monday , November 21 ) the telephone in my room rang . Anna Louise 's voice : ' You 'd better come , ' it said . Rayna is dead . ' IX Rayna Prohme died on Monday , November 21 , 1927 , and was cremated on the following Thursday , November 24 ( Thanksgiving Day ) . I left Moscow the day after the funeral and have not been there since . An autopsy held on November 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not surprise me : Rayna had died of encephalitis , inflammation of the brain . It must have begun many months before , and all through this time she had been exactly , literally , burning to ashes , just as the shell she had discarded was to be burned to ashes at the crematorium . No human being could so irresistibly suggest the quality of flame without being consumed for it . On the afternoon of the funeral we all marched for hours across Moscow to the new crematorium . There were delegations of Chinese , Russian , and American Communists , many of whom had never known Rayna . It was very cold , and as I walked along I became conscious of the shivering , bent figure of Madame Sun Vat-sen . IIer income from China had been cut off ; she was too proud to accept the help of strangers ; she had no winter clothing at all , and was walking through the dreary , frozen streets in a thin dark cloak . The motor car lent her by the Soviet Foreign Office followed behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to persuade her to get into it , but she would not . She walked every step of the way across the city , her lovely face bent clown on her folded arms . She had only recovered from her own illness a few days before , and her pallor was extreme . Even through the cold haze in which everything moved on that day I was aware that Soong Ching-ling was now the loneliest of exiles , shivering through the early dark behind the bier of her one wholly disinterested friend . The band played ? out of tune ? the revolutionary funeral march , alternating it w , th Chopin 's . The maddening music , k to lusty brasses a good half note off pitch , made the long procession hard to endure even for those who had never known Rayna . Eventually ? it was dark by now , and the great bells of the near-by convent were ringing for evening service ? we came to the modern crematorium outside the city . It was brightlylighted , square and spare . The bier , draped in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chrysanthemums , all the flowers of Rayna 's own colors , a heap of gold and red and brown , ? was placed on the platform . There were speeches in Chinese , Russian , and English ? revolutionary speeches . The English sounded just as meaningless as the Chinese or the Russian . Then a signal was given , a switch wan turned , and the golden mass of Rayna , her hair and her bright flowers and the Red flag , sank slowly before us into the furnace . That night Borodin came to see me . Be looked colossal in my narrow room as he walked slowly up and down , speaking . I was on the lied and do not remember having said anything at all . He had come to say good-bye , he said , and to explain why he had not gone to the funeral . On principle he never went to funerals , The mind must be kept resolutely on its purposes . His voice was deeply moved , and he controlled it with difficulty . He did not look at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back again . ' I know what this is , ' he said . ' I know exactly . But what is needed is the long view . I have come here t ) ask you to take the long view ? China , Russia . . . A wonderful friend and a wonderful revolutionary instrument ; have disappeared together . But there is no use in anything unless see take the long view . Remember that . China , Russia . After a few minutes he shook hands and went away . In the morning I took the train to Berlin .
