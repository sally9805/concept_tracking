This is one memory that I hope the passing years will never dim . " MacCormack was a private in the 316th infantry on ** and the Americans were in the midst of a furious battle near Verdun . " We were in a shallow trench , Parkin and I , when the Germans swept over us , " MacCormack related . In the heavy rain of bullets Parkin was wounded twice in the right leg .
