SMIRT - Branch Cabell - McBride ( $2.50 ) . <P> Author Branch Cabell , a newcomer to the U. S. scene , has written only three books ( These Restless Heads , Special Delivery , Smirt ) . But they bear a marked likeness to the 18 volumes of one James Branch Cabell , who announced in 1929 that he would write no more of the Biography of the Life of Manuel . Now 54 , Author Cabell has found it impossible to change his spots . A much-gnawed bone of contention , with little marrow left . Author Cabell can still rouse his faithful followers to delight . Considered by himself and his admirers the most polished of U. S. writers , Cabell is often accused of writing in Wardour St. style-defined by Lexicographer H. W. Fowler as " ... a selection of oddments calculated to establish ( in the eyes of some readers ) their claim to be persons of taste &; writers of beautiful English . " <P> Smirt , subtitled An Urbane Nightmare , is solemnly introduced by smirking Author Cabell as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented from the actual point of view of a dreamer . " Disregarding James Joyce 's partially-published Work in Progress , Author Cabell avers that , with the exception of Lewis Carroll 's Alice books , no such attempt has ever been made in English . But Cabell is a lover of red herrings . Actually Smirt is hardly more than a loosely-strung series of essays on its author 's favorite topic ( his own position as a writer ) , with occasional Jurgenish passages about love , sprightly interviews with God , the Devil , the public-at-large . <P> If it were not for his preoccupation with snobbish prose , Author Cabell might be capable of really savage satire . Even in his " habitual vein of romantic irony " he sometimes drops into a phrase that would have given even Jonathan Swift pause , as when he speaks of physical love as " a conjuncture of sewer pipes . " But generally Cabell is content to continue astounding the bourgeois by his own superior urbanity . His intelligence and taste alike are now for most readers hopelessly buried under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
