Whoever succeeds James McCauley Landis as chairman of the Securities &; Exchange Commission this fall will inherit not only old problems but a portfolio chock-full of new and zestful business . Milestones in the Commission 's career last week were : 1 ) the first arrest brought about by SEC lawyers , and 2 ) the first application for reorganization filed with SEC under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 . <P> Arrest . For several weeks SEC has been investigating the sale of some 273,000 shares of stock registered last year by Trenton Valley Distillers Corp. , a sizable company with a plant at Detroit , which is now closed . It was discovered first that the stock had not been sold through the underwriters named in the registration statement ; further , that the company took $1 a share for stock which was at that time selling for $3 over-the-counter in Detroit . The difference was apparently absorbed by no less than four sets of middle men and at least two go-betweens , who contradicted one another in testimony , alternately claiming and disclaiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand . <P> In this preposterous maze SEC haled up Trenton Valley 's ex-president , a Canadian named Harry Low , who promptly put himself in hot water by admitting that he had himself contracted to buy 45,000 shares of his company 's stock at $1 , a fact not mentioned in the registration statement . To the Commission 's counsel , E. Forrest Tancer and H. Victor Schwimmer , this seemed a willful omission-a plain violation of the Securities Act , punishable by fine or imprisonment . Usual procedure in such cases is for SEC to hand over its material to the Department of Justice , clarify the stock sale for SEC examiners. * Accordingly last week they had red-faced Distiller Low arrested by a U. S. marshal , and announced that they would seek an indictment at the close of the investigation . <P> Development . First big break in the united front of U. S. utilities against the Utility Act came last February when great North American Co. ( assets : $900,000,000 ) and American Water Works &; Electric Co. ( $384,000,000 ) consented to drop their litigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies registered has reached $6 , representing assets of $5,000,000,000 out of a total of $17,000,000,000 in all companies affected by the Act . Beyond this there had been no public developments in this battle of the pyramids until last week when American Water Works offered SEC a plan for the simplification of its corporate structure . <P> Owning electric and gas properties in Pennsylvania , Ohio , West Virginia , Maryland and Virginia , the company argued that most of its power subsidiaries were already connected by transmission lines and required no geographical round-up ( such as the Act might enforce on the loose units of other companies ) . In addition , American Water Works actually controls more than 80 water companies in 21 States and in Cuba . The company asked that , as the Act permits , these be found ' ' reasonably incidental or economically necessary or appropriate to the operation of the system . "
