AN ARTIST 'S GAME BAG-Lynn Bogue Hunt-Derrydale ( $15 ) . <P> People who can afford Hardy trout-rods and Purdy shotguns can afford books like this . In fact , 25 such persons may spend $125 each for a leather-bound autographed copy of Artist Hunt 's sketch book and put it away for their grandsons to look at when buffleheads , woodcock , black-breasted plover , wild turkeys and the like are extinct . Artist Hunt is the man who makes animal stories look so attractive in fiction magazines . This volume testifies eloquently that he , like Etcher Frank Benson , has gone to nature for his learning , really knows his game . The publisher will somewhat exasperate his customers by including only four color prints , and one of those a too-streamlined conception of canvasback , but the black &; white pages are made warm by the artist 's pencilled notes , ' ' Yellow Legs , Fire Island-The Good Old Days ! " ; " Wings of the River Ducks , Monroe Marshes , 1909 . All Drakes " ; " Pintails-They come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book : " Woodcock-October Flight , " a plate with the violet of early evening on swamp alders , and the big yellow moon coming over the mountain , easily a match for Rex Brasher 's more meticulous rendition of the same ghostly little subject .
