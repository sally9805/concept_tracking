txt REDUCING FOULS IN POLO Suggests Benching of Offending Player as Suitable Penalty To Sports Editor of The New York Times : I was very interested to see in my local paper , The Glen Cove RecordAdvance , some suggestions for the improvement of polo . I agree entirely with the article and also with a letter it evoked from another reader of the same paper . Commenting on the international polo series , the article in question said in part : " The first game was remarkable for the number of fouls made by the United States and the poor use of this golden opportunity by the British . " It may be argued that , with the inclusion of the player who makes his livelihood from polo , gentlemanly refinements would of necessity be eliminated and that , with bread and butter hanging* in the balance , a foul would become someI thing to be risked rather than avoided . " Certainly this would be sound reasoning if other professional competitions were any criterion . However , in this particular case the argument falls dismally flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent men it was the United States team . Three Rules Recommendations " However , in an effort to ' take the profit out of fouling , ' we hazard the following suggestions : " ( 1 ) A player having two fouls called against him in one period should be ruled off the field for two minutes . " ( 2 ) If he should commit another foul in the same period on his return to the field , he should be ruled off for the next four minutes . " ( 3 ) If he should commit four fouls , he should leave the field for the remainder of the game . " These may seem unrefined measures , but it must be remembered that fifteen fouls in one game are equally unrefined . Of one thing we are confident : the only players who would find these rules burdensome would be those who deserved to be ' benched ' anyway . " Would Eliminate Free Shot A subsequent letter , signed " Polo ' Enthusiast , " made the further suggestion that the benching of the offending player @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the awarding of a free shot and advocated the elimination of the free shot completely . This correspondent also proposed that the number of fouls committed by each player be posted opposite his name on the scoreboard , saying that this " would not only act as a deterrent but also would enlighten the spectators . " It seems to me that there is no question about the weakness of the foul rule . Fouls slow down the game from the spectator 's point of view and the present penalties , on account of the margin of error in shooting fouls , do not seem sufficiently serious to deter the players from taking dangerous and unwarranted risks . J. H. VAN ALEN . Roslyn , N. Y. , June 27 , 1939 . Tells of Profitable Enterprise To Sports Editor of The New York Times : Your correspondent , William Conklin , says that bookmaking was unknown in this country forty years ago . Let me correct him . I contributed toward a fund to bankroll a book at Morris Park , in Westchester , in August , 1889  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim Davey was on the block ; Cornelius , brother of the then lightweight champion , was the cashier . We made a profit of $110,000 in ten days . The man who favors the machines over the hooks either does not know his arithmetic or else is suffering from exalted altruism . LUKE O'REILLY . Brooklyn , June 27 , 1939 . Editorial Note : Maybe it was a mistake to mention that profit of $110,000 by one book in ten days . Or was it " exalted altruism " ? A Good Deed That Could Be Done To Sports Editor of The New York Times : Organized baseball could build an outstanding monument to Lou Gehrig before the children of this nation if the management were in- clined to give the proceeds from one day 's games to the national organization now fighting infantile paralysis , of which Keith Morgan is chairman . Baseball never has done much in a charitable way , particularly nationally , although its big business is based on back-lot games of children . If this suggestion meets with your approval , I sincerely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WALKER WEAR , New York State Athletic Commission . New York , June 27 , 1939 . Editorial Note : Aside from the kindly suggestion made in this letter , baseball has done much in a charitable way , particularly through the annual all-star games , the proceeds of which go to provide aid for old and indigent members 01 the profession . ST . ELMO II NOW HERE Stallion Son of Pharos at Stud in Princeton , Turf Fan Writes To Sports Editor of The New York Times : We learn that Pharis , the Frenchbred son of Pharos , has won the 1,000,000 franc Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp . Those of us who are more familiar with the turf and its history know , of course , that Pharis is the half-brother of Nearco , the " wonder horse " of Europe and the winner of last year 's Grand Prix , in which he beat Bois Roussell , English Derby winner , and Cilli , French Derby winner , et al . Nearco was afterward sold to Bennett in England for $300,000 , the largest known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , is all French turf history . What is of headline importance to breeders and racing stable owners in this country , and so far no New York paper has ever given it a line , is that a half-brother of both Nearco and Pharis is in this country . It is a fact . The only stallion son of Pharos , that mighty sire of European horses , in the United States is right here in Princeton , N. J. I refer to imp . St. Elmo II , owned by Mrs. Dora V. Kellogg . Imp . St. Elmo II is by Pharos out of Frisky , Pharos being the sire of both Nearco and Pharis . Frisky is the dam of Turbulent , the outstanding English 2-year-old of last year . I am mentioning this because I thought it to be a matter of vital importance to racing enthusiasts , breeders and owners in this part of the country to know that a horse of such faultless breeding and such fine winning stock , he being a winner himself , is located here . JAMES M. GULICK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Says Photos Show Jostling To Sports Editor of The New York Times : John Kieran 's analysis of the Princeton Mile incident was very fair and , as a Britisher , I tried to remain strictly impartial on the subject . But the photographs published in THE TIMES make the situation rather hard to swallow . Rideout 's tactics were either rotten bad manners or a deliberate jockeying of Wooderson to let Fenske through . On the evidence of the photographs the claim of foul was justified and it should have been declared no race . Whether Wooderson would have proved the winner is really beside the point . He was psychologically licked when that most amateurish jostling took place . IVAN G. DOUBRLE . New Hope , Pa. , June 26 , 1939 . Editorial Note : No official claim of foul was filed and the referee stated that if such claim had been made it would not have been allowed to stand . Photographs should not always be accepted at face value . Some photographs need interpreting . Worse Could Have Happened To Sports Editor of The New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Pharlap ( sic ) when he tried to win . They poisoned him . I dare you to publish this note from a disgusted Australian . CHARLES EDWARDS . New York , June 26 , 1939 . Editorial Note : Perhaps some other " disgusted Australian " will ask how any one dared to write the great Phar Lap 's name in that abbreviated fashion . HANDS ACROSS THE SEA English Writer Makes Light of ' Foul ' in Princeton Mile To Sports Editor of The New York Times : I have read with regret those letters published in your esteemed paper regarding the still much-discussed Princeton Mile and feel that perhaps a line from me , as one of the English party of four who came over , might assist to clear the air a little upon this tremendously exaggerated incident . First , I would like to compliment your writer , John Kieran , upon his honesty of opinion and his fairness in expression . He at least did not get hysterical or write in a biased attitude . Sydney Wooderson was confident of winning , however the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast . Stanley , his younger brother , and Coach Albert Hill were extra confident that nobody would beat Sydney and fully expected a new record of about 4:04 to be set . I expected that much if Wooderson was himself as we have seen him in England , but I always have expressed a fear that he may have raced too severely in England with those five final tryout races . You will remember that Wooderson is a very small , slight athlete . Coach Hill was convinced I was wrong and that Wooderson would show that he was only warming up in England . Every Man for Himself None of us at any time even considered the possibility of foul running or any trickery . We were fully satisfied that the five contestants were out to win for themselves with one idea , that the best man win . Coach Hill even asked Rideout if he would make the pace a record one to oblige Wooderson , but Rideout could not promise that , saying that he was out to win himself . So that was that to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself when he found none of his opponents willing is known to himself . He told me he was expecting somebody to go out after the first lap but , finding nobody , he just went on himself , waiting for the straight for home . I feel that he became overwhelmed and did not know what to do . The " incident " occurred just before the straight . Rideout did cut in a little too sharply and push Sydney out of his stride , but in the straight little Sydney could not show any of that brilliance we have seen in England . The pictures show me convincingly that Wooderson was not himself and was well beaten . Fenske was magnificent . By what I can discover , Brother Stanley and Coach Hill were excusably upset momentarily and what they may have said was misunderstood by those critics who are out solely for sensation . They sent the word to England , where similar critics seized it eagerly . Thus unpleasant reading was manufactured and published to the detriment of international sport . All for International Sport I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do more for the peace of the world than all the politicians put together . Let us all forget the incident completely as one of those unfortunate things that just happen . I am sure my articles in England will clear at least a lot of the suspicion created in that country . The News of the World reaches every part of the globe where the English tongue is spoken , so that should help a lot to clear matters . We have had a most wonderful time in this country , and I feel quite overwhelmed with the great kindness and hospitality we have received . I have seen nearly fifty years of big athletics in most parts of the world and never before has the hospitality I am receiving here today been exceeded . The Woodersons have sailed for home , but I am staying on for the national championships at Lincoln , Neb. , on July 3-4 . English and American athletes are the greatest friends on and off the track and that is how it must remain for all time . Jon BTNKS . News of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1939 . Editorial Note : ' ' For this relief , much thanks . "
