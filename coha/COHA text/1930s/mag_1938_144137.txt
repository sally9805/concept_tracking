If a man had 277 children he would have something to worry about . But not Man o ' War . Munching hay at his homestead at Faraway Farms , near Lexington , Ky. , Man o ' War , not quite 21 , * had last week nothing to worry about-not even the preparations for his big birthday party March 29th-and he had something new ( if he had known it ) to be proud of . <P> In his racing days ( 1919-20 ) , Man o ' War , a golden chestnut colt familiarly known as " Big Red , " won all but one of the 21 races he started , established five U. S. track records and was said to be the greatest horse in the history of U. S. racing when he was retired to the stud of his owner , Samuel 13 . Riddle , in 1921 . In the 14 years since his first foals became of racing age ( 1924 ) , Big Red 's progeny have won more money than the sons &; daughters of any other sire+ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most famed stallion standing in the U. S. <P> At year 's end , three months ago , while Man o ' War munched hay , racing authorities were scratching their heads in an effort to decide whether War Admiral , his son , or Seabiscuit , his grandson , was the best racehorse of 1937 . <P> War Admiral , a three-year-old last year , had won every race he started , including the so-called triple crown ( Kentucky Derby . Preakness , Belmont Stakes ) , and wound up the year with earnings of $166,500 in spite of being hors de combat for five months because of a sore foot . His owner , Samuel D. Riddle , and many another thought War Admiral was the greatest horse in the world . <P> Seabiscuit , a four-year-old last year , was champion of the handicap division , had nosed out War Admiral as leading money winner of the year with a total of $168,580 ; but Seabiscuit had conclusively shown that he could be defeated-as he was four times out of 15 starts . His owner , Charles S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the greatest horse in the world . <P> Last week , after hoping against hope to see Seabiscuit and War Admiral run on the same turf at the same time , the horse racing world was treated to the next best thing . On the same day , in the two top-ranking races of the winter season ( the $100,000 Santa Anita Handicap and the $50,000 WIdener Challenge Cup ) , Seabiscuit was entered against the best horses running in California and War Admiral was entered against the best in Florida . Both , of course , were favorites.
