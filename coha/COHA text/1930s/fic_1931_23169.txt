LEAF UNFOLDING A STORY BY GRIFFITH SEEMS T HE first person Paul Aldrich met in Bear Harbor that summer was Jenny Vernay . He had come down to the beach , wearing sunglasses and carrying his watch in his hand , planning to expose himself to the sun for twelve minutes the first day . The irregular , sandy triangle bared among the rocks at the head of the harbor was deserted . Off to the right gulls were feeding and screaming where a brook filtered through pebbles into the ocean . Paul noted that it was seventeen minutes past three and lay down , with his robe under his head , and dosed his eyes . After a time he heard feet lifting in the sand and , turning his head , saw two girls in bathing suits walking toward him . They were about seventeen years old . The prettier one lagged and hesitated , but the foremost girl , short , dumpish , and beaming in a red suit , sank down not ten feet from Paul and said : " Hello ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , are n't you ? " " Yes . " Paul sat up and removed his sun-glasses . " Do you think you 'll like it here ? " " I expect to enjoy myself . " " It 's awfully quiet . Is n't it , Ruth ? " Without stopping for the answer , she went on , " Everyone says Bear Harbor is the deadest place in Maine . " " I sha n't mind that . " " You simply do n't know what you 're in for . " She sighed . " No movies , nothing . " " How did you know my name ? " " Mr. Sones at the hotel desk told me . You see , I happened to be at the dock when you came this morning . " " Really . " " Mr. Aldrich , this is Ruth Skelton . I 'm Genevieve Vernay . " Paul acknowledged the introductions . The double dimple in Jenny 's face became fixed . " What do you do , Mr. Aldrich ? " " I am enjoying my vacation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work at when you 're not on vacation ? " " I am secretary to the President of the United States . " " Oh ! How wonderful ! Tell me about it . What sort of things do you do ? " " I double for him . " " Double for him ? " " Yes , I put on one of the President 's collars and a wig , and shake hands for him . People take me for the President when I am disguised . And I always take his place at battleship christenings and assassinations . " " Oh , you go jump in the lake , " Jenny exclaimed indignantly . " Come on , Ruth . " Paul had overstayed three minutes . Outside his hotel window , while he dressed , robins were disturbing the wild cherry branches , and beyond the tree tops rested the round granite summits of two of the nearby Penobscot Mountains . He went down to the desk to ask , for the second time that day , for mail , hoping unreasonably for a letter from Marjorie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in November . The box was empty , and he went out on to the veranda . Distant blue islands barred the harbor from the open Atlantic , their pebbly beaches shining glassily in the afternoon sun . Within the cove , like a desultory flock of birds , a flotilla of sloops and knockabouts , launches and varnished speedboats , all drifted parallel by the tide , veered at their moorings . The fish-wharf , a yacht club , and the steamboat landing encumbered the shore . On the wooded hillsides surrounding the harbor , the gables and chimneys of the summer homes were interspersed with the pine tops . Paul walked into the village . The forest came down upon it like a green glacier . The single street , strung for a mile with incongruous houses , forked when it came to the harbor . At this intersection lay the village green and a stone watering-trough surmounted by a bronze bear head . A man in unpressed white flannels sitting on the stoop in front of the barber shop spoke to Paul ; four girls had left their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's drugstore . He heard the ring of metal , and behind the garage and filling station came upon a set of chauffeurs , coats off and vests unbuttoned , playing horseshoes . The post office and general store were in the same building , with coleus and fuchsias filling one front window . " How delightful , how delightful ! " Paul kept whispering to himself . When he went down to the beach the next afternoon to tan for twenty minutes , Jenny withdrew from a group of girls and walked over to him . " You must n't tease me , " she said dignifiedly , collapsing beside him and putting on a ragged straw hat . " Doctor Skelton  --  that 's Ruth 's father  --  says I have a fleshy heart and must always live placidly . " " I am very sorry about your heart . Where is Ruth this afternoon ? " " She does n't always come down . She does n't like the water and only comes to tan herself . The ocean 's really frightfully cold . My teeth chatter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jenny hunched her plump shoulders and shivered . " Does n't Ruth swim ? " " Not a stroke . She 's a dear , is n't she ? " Jenny moved her shoulders engagingly and leaned nearer . " Do n't you think she 's pretty ? " " Very , " Paul said , noncommittally . " She 's very pretty . She has the loveliest hair , and she 's a perfect dear . But do you know , just between ourselves  --  confidentially  --  she is n't popular . I ca n't make out why . I 've done simply everything to bring her out and talked about her to different boys for hours . They say she 's stuck up . Jimmy McCrae hates her . Ruth would be furious if she heard me talking about her  --  she 's dreadfully proud  --  but I do so want to see her popular . Are you going to be here long ? Perhaps you could take her out . There are dances at Neighborhood Hall every Wednesday night , and there is something going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might make the other boys jealous and then they 'd come running . I wish you would , Mr. Aldrich . " " I had hoped to spend the summer very quietly . " " Ruth is very quiet . I just know you two will enjoy each other . By the way , you are n't married , are you ? " " Is n't any kindness shown to married men ? " " Of course not . Married men are too free . Please tell me . " " I have to go back to the hotel or I shall get sunburned . " " All right for you if you wo n't tell me . I know , anyway . Somebody happened to see the letter you mailed this morning , and it was n't to any Mrs. ' either . Besides , I knew because you have n't any manners . " She stalked back to the other girls . The next morning when Paul went to the post office to mail another letter he encountered Ruth , who , with some thirty others , was waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the street together . " This is the way I have to go , " she said . " Would you like to come and meet my father ? " The Skeltons owned a small summer cottage set back in the woods , and on the screened-in porch a burly man in house-slippers was waiting , smoking a briar pipe . He had an evenly cropped mustache and sandy , tufted eyebrows . " Here 's your paper , daddy . This is Mr. Aldrich . Daddy is so concerned with what may be happening back in Dedham , Massachusetts , that he ca n't rest in the mornings until he has his paper . " Doctor Skelton stood up slowly , put his pipe down , and shook hands with Paul . " You must have a care , sir , for my daughter . When she discovers your failing she will surely publish it . " The doctor 's eyelids flickered slyly . Ruth looked back at him , her eyes mocking his . " How do you like Bear Harbor ? " " I Iike it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have six weeks here and I mean to do a great deal of walking . I understand the mountain trails are splendid . " " Perhaps you 're a bit of a natural scientist ? " The doctor sat down , resumed his pipe , and began tearing the wrapper from the newspaper . " Hardly a natural scientist . I had several courses in biology at Harvard . " Mrs. Skelton , plump and complacent , came out and was introduced . " So you went to Harvard , " she said . " If Ruth were a boy , we 'd send her there , would n't we , father ? " " Probably , " Doctor Skelton answered . " Personally , I 'm glad she 's a girl . She may be spoiled , but she wo n't tell a lie or smoke cigarettes ; and a girl who does n't do those things nowadays wo n't ever go far wrong . " Ruth kissed him on the forehead . " Come on , Mr. Aldrich , I 'll show you my house . " Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came , in a glade , to a magnificent white birch , walled about with conifers , rank upon rank back into gloom . Between each cordate leaf the sunlight intertwined like the reticulations of a golden net . The fallen leaves had been neatly raked into a pile at one side . Ruth sat down on a bowlder with another rock as a back rest , while Paul found a place among the birch roots . " This is my house . I often come out here and sit for hours . When that spot reaches that stone , it will be noon . Sometimes I read , and sometimes I just sit quietly and think . Daddy says it is n't thinking  --  he says I sit and grow , like a vegetable . Anyway , I like to do it . Sometimes I clean house . I have a kitchen , too , " pointing to several raspberry bushes , " but the cupboard is bare . I 've eaten them all . Oh , I must show you my child ! " She knocked two stones together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peeked into her empty hand , and then skimmed away . " I call him Rudolph . I chose that name because he 's so little that he needs an imposing name . How do you like my house ? " " I like it very much . I 'm very glad that you invited me . " " I 'm extremely fond of it . I 've named it Birchvale Manor . Every house around here has to have a name , you know . It 's too bad that I have n't any nuts for Rudolph . He puts them in his mouth and looks as though he had the mumps . I 've been neglecting him , poor child . " The sunlight , sifting through the birch leaves , dappled Ruth 's light-green dress and pale blond hair , colored like honey , and , where the sunlight fell , yellow as pollen . Two natural love-locks curled beside her ears , but otherwise she wore it simply , drawn into a knot , where the more golden strands twisted with the ashen ones like Spanish jeweler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soft skin evenly tanned to the shade of faintly scorched bond paper ; the eyes were wide apart and small and blue ; the forehead childishly straight ; nose retrousse ; and her lips , although ever too slightly thin , parted and upturned to let out laughter like a carillon of tiny bells . All the while she talked , and at every word she smiled or swayed with laughter ; the mischievous eyelids dropped ; over her face animation fleeted like a wave curling about a sunny rock . " Some days I 'm very quiet . I hardly say a word . Other days I 'm like this " ( laughing through her fingers spread before her eyes ) " and just talk and talk . Daddy says my tongue runs on greased hinges . One day I 'm this way . Another day I 'm so quiet you 'd never recognize me . I do n't know why it is . You must have thought the cat had my tongue that day that we met first . " Paul was charmed . Under this guileless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was aware of a quality  --  for him a new quality a serene innocence that at-tracted him even when he scarcely attended to her words . When she was talking he listened , but after a time vaguely dreamed , picking up small thoughts like scarlet ravelings scattered in his mind . He wished for sexless creatures , who had the grace and loveliness of women without their necessities , who to every pursuit might add the uncertainty of an incorruptible object . Perceiving Ruth , bending on the rock amid the still restlessness of the forest , he almost believed in such a miracle . They went that evening after supper for a walk by Orchard Pond . A light mist , exhaling from the water , vague as a breath , outlined the meandering lake and drifted up the hollows of the hills . Invisible minnows leaped with a tiny plash ; the rings of widening ripples interlaced and passed among the reeds . Paul and Ruth followed by a road that ran beside the pond . Barbed and fleet , swallows flicked the surface with their breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nipisiguit a bell-buoy continuously tolled . " It moos like a cow ! " Ruth exclaimed . Before turning back , they sat down on a bench nailed between two trees . " This is the place , one night , that Jimmy McCrae tried to kiss me . He did n't seem to know whether be should or not , and he was so awkward that I could n't resist . I bit his lower lip . Oh , but he was angry ! " Ruth laughed until she swayed against him . The sun went behind the bald mountains , leaving along the ridge a pale yellow band . Evening descended like a drifting leaf . Silently they watched the birches on the margin of the lake fade to elongated ghosts . Ruth suddenly stood up . " What is your name ? " " My first name ? " " Yes , of course . " " Paul . " " You ca n't catch me , Paul ! " She ran down the road laughing and not looking back . When he caught up to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road with her legs apart , her bosom upthrust and panting , and her head back , laughing and gasping . The trembling of her flesh sent a fierceness through him . " Paul , " she said , " I 'm sorry  --  I could n't help it . The pond and the sky back there were too solemn for me . They would have squelched me in another moment . You do n't mind , do you ? " He answered heavily , " You are more terrible to bear than the sky . " " Yes , it was terrible of me , was n't it ? " she said gaily . " Mercy , I 'm all out of breath ! " A delightful intimacy began . They went walking almost every day along the sea cliffs and picked blueberries for Mrs. Skelton or , lying among the trailing yew , stared at the sea , curded lavender and green , while regattas of sailboats put out from behind the islands . Twice a day the steamer passed , in opposite directions , and they played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They scrambled among the rocks , searching for jasper stone and gathering harebells , or basked in the sun , while Ruth let down her hair . Once she smoked a cigarette , admitting it was her third . " I like to see the smoke . " She laid the cigarette upon a rock and tangled the blue ascending thread with her fingers . Paul never uttered love to her , as though the elision of the word saved him faithful to Marjorie , but he knew his gentleness and patience were those of a lover . He could not resist saying the little extravagant compliments that his head concocted . He had known only women more experienced , or pretending to be more experienced , than himself ; he thought of Ruth 's innocence as a fixed , secret quality . It tantalized him , like the bouquet of a strong , slowly sipped liqueur , as though , in every thoughtless word she spoke , in the shallow streams of her loquacity he might isolate and analyze a mystery as the senses dissever aromatics from their base . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her mind never formulated descriptions of what they saw , but floated , impressionable as air , among the smells and colors , warmth and light , of the island . She liked him , Paul thought , just as a child does , for a listener who does not interrupt and intrude curt adult values . One afternoon they went to Great Point , where the island thrust a massive granite fist , hairy with fir trees , into the Atlantic . They clambered down the foremost cliff until they were shut off by abrupt yellow granite , stained with purple oxides , straight to the sky . At their feet the ocean fumed and seethed , inundating and spraying on the rocks , then ebbing and cascading downwards until the ledge seemed to totter , and Ruth shouted that they would slide into the sea . They crept back and lay upon a flattish rock . At their side the ocean pounded out its broken rhythms . Lying on their backs , they watched the clouds drift from behind the cliff walls . " I wish that blueberries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Just think how they would taste then . " " I like them now . " " So do I , but then they would taste as though the cream were in them when you picked them . The sky is just like blueberries and cream all mushed together . " There was a silence . Paul watched the gulls , wheeling , as did the clouds , over the cliff wall , and drifting down upon him until he saw the rachis of each feather in the spread pinions . They sailed in profile past , hooked bill , blunt body , and flapping cambered wings . A fish-hawk scanned the sea ; the gulls were specks against the clouds above him . Paul glanced at Ruth . She was asleep , her arm over her eyes , one knee updrawn , the other arm outflung ; the nails on the half-bent fingers gleamed gemmiferously . Her body , conforming to the rocks , was flat , save for her breasts , like two halved apples underneath her dress ; at her side , a straight blue shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a brown wood-rat scampered along a crevice down to high-water mark and began to eat barnacles , crunching the shells and picking out the meat . Paul threw a stone . Ruth took down her arm . " You 've been asleep , " Paul said severely . " No , I have n't , " she answered , squinting and laughing , " I was just pretending . Heavens , my complexion will be a sight . Look  --  look ! " as a gull passed overhead . " It goes on and on . Do you believe in reincarnation ? " she added suddenly . " No , not very much . " " Mama does . She believes that in another reincarnation she was a Pilgrim . When she first went to Plymouth , before she believed in reincarnation , she says that all at once she remembered Plymouth exactly as it was hundreds of years ago . The burying-ground was in exactly the same place . She thought that the meeting-house was at a particular spot , and when she looked it up on the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reincarnation , but daddy just laughs at her . He says she must have remembered her history lessons about the Pilgrims better than she remembers most history . " " Do you believe in reincarnation ? " " Sometimes , " she answered , with the abrupt , capricious intonation that dismissed a subject . " Had n't we better go ? It 's five o'clock . " The weeks went by . The purple thistles changed to draggled fuzz ; thecrimson sumac panicles turned brown ; wild roses fell and left their hardening seeds ; the young speckled robins came to have red breasts . Paul frequently walked alone , but in dreamy abstraction , remembering now a gesture , examining an aversion , fitting remarks , uttered days apart , together , in order to fix Ruth 's quality in imperishable lucidity . Often he thought her a silly little thing , for all her grace . Her mind , though quick , was erratic and undisciplined . It spent itself joyously as does light confused within a prism . She kept a diary , and though she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her house she read him from it . It told where they had gone and said the day was fine . She even read him , shyly , " ' Paul said that I am pretty . ' He remembered what he had said : " You 're very pretty , Ruth . Your head is like a giant yellow chrysanthemum , whose petals have been combed back into a knot , and caught a bumble-bee , buzzing inside , who 's drunk with honey that he finds there . " When he reminded her , somewhat piqued , she said , " I could n't remember all of it . You do n't mind , do you ? Please write it down here on the page . " He admitted her inferiority to Marjorie 's intelligent maturity , but still he thought of Ruth . She had , he found , created for herself an image as a madcap  --  gay , eccentric , irresponsible  --  by which she lived and justified her whims , her irrelevant conversations and disjointed moods . It made her drive an automobile recklessly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewelry and odd porcelain toys and lock them in a box . This deliberately uncontrolled impulsiveness bewitched him ; it promised what he was unwilling to define and , instead of endeavoring to define it , he trusted in her incorruptibility . At times he denied her any secret element . The slender , oval face , her narrow , pale , straight forehead , exquisitely beveled at the line of the hair , the wide-apart blue eyes under the shallow brows , the nose and mouth delicately under-proportioned , these were the physical characteristics attributed to innocence by an arbitrary convention created by Lancret and Fragonard . Her girlish , high voice and ring of laughter , the bright rivulet of her speech , were the incidents of adolescence . But at other times he sensed a quality , almost tangible , whose quintessence was innocence as that of the brain was thought . He conceived her as an enigma , whose contradictions , however clearly he set them in opposition one against another , never comprehended the whole of her disturbing tranquillity . She knew that a boundary line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not choose , she was not compelled , to participate in the antagonism over it . By not admitting the antagonism , she did not undergo the necessity of any surrender . Her innocence was a strange , sweet , unbelievable neutrality , which , although he condemned himself , subtly and ardently he tried to intimidate or excite . " You must n't let boys kiss you , " he said . " Kisses make freckles . " " How many are there ? " she asked , presenting her forehead . " Seven . " " That 's not enough , " she declared . " Your theory is wrong , " and proffered him her mouth , her body tiptoe as though for flight . " I shall give you a very large freckle before I go away , " he said , asking himself if it were fear that had restrained him . He loved to look at her , at her diminutive profile , the small mazed ear , the shadows under the chin and eyebrow , and to draw out slowly , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feel the weight of it uncoilingthrough his fingers . One day , when she had laid her hand upon a spruce trunk and stuck the gum between her fingers , he licked them with gnawing kisses . " Do n't ! " she had said , laughing , " You tickle ! " Her tanned , long-legged body , with golden down along the arms , was so warmly , actively , and substantially a woman 's that he wanted to strike her , to seize her , to set defiance in her eyes , or fear . Then he reproached himself for being rakish and old that innocence could so arouse him . One morning on the beach Jenny and Ruth and Paul were talking of Ruth and Boaz , David and Solomon . Paul declared that these people , for all the Bible said , lived barbarously . " How would you like to be just one among Solomon 's seven hundred wives ? " he asked . " And concubines , " Ruth added seriously . Jenny 's cheeks flattened ; she was shocked . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul said , glancing at Jenny , who was glancing at him Ruth stamped her naked foot on the sand . " I do n't see why you always treat me like a child . I know what a concubine is just as well as either of you . Whenever we 're alone Paul treats me like an equal , but when we 're before you , Jenny , he treats me as though I were a baby . I do n't like it , and I do n't like Paul for doing it . " " When we 're alone we have our own secrets to talk about , " Paul said soothingly . " If I speak differently before Jenny , it 's because I like to tease her , and I never tease you . " Later he startled himself by reflecting that Ruth 's outburst might have come from jealousy . That same afternoon Jenny sought Ruth out in her house . " I want to have a serious talk with you , " she said , settling herself on the stone and coming at once to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes , " said Ruth , so simply that Jenny was annoyed . " Are you in love with him ? " " No  --  I do n't think so . No , I 'm sure I 'm not . Nothing has changed . Everything for me is just the same as it has always been . " " When is be leaving ? " " In  --  in twelve days . " " Has he asked you to marry him ? " " No . " Ruth was surprised . " Then he is n't in love with you , " Jenny declared firmly . " If a man really loves you he asks you to marry him . " " I do n't want to marry him . I do n't want to marry anybody . " " That 's neither here nor there . Has he said he was in love with you ? " Jenny was exciting herself with her questions . " No . " " Then how do you know ? " " I just know . " " But how ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll bet he 's not in love with you . He 's in love with that girl he writes to in New York . He 's too old , anyway . " " He 's not too old  --  he 's only thirty , and he is in love with me . " " Well , if he is , why does n't he ask you to marry him ? That 's the test . " " It is not . " " It is . " " It is not ! " " What is this secret he talks about ? " " There is n't any secret . He was just talking . " " Just talking , " sniffed Jenny , " I think that 's all he has been doing . He 's taken you in very nicely . " These questions , to which Ruth had never before been obliged to give an answer , began to trouble her . Such of the novels as she had read supported Jenny , but all her intuition assured herthat she had rightly understood Paul 's attitude . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " so I will know definitely after he 's gone . " There came three days of fog and rain , when Paul stayed in his room and read . On the fourth morning the sun shone and the harbor flashed through the trees . Already several sails were being unreefed. and in Badger 's drugstore newspapers had been laid in the front window over the cosmetic display as a protection from the sun . Paul met Ruth in the post office , and they were overjoyed to see each other again . " Let 's climb a mountain , " Paul proposed . The path wound through the deep , sun-flecked forest . Under the slender dogberry stems , bending with brilliant blue berries , the leaves were waxy . No one had passed that morning , and the barred spiders had hung cobwebs , still luminous with raindrops , across the path . Following single file , Ruth and Paul had to stoop so as not to sever them . Over the cool , damp , rooty earth , scarlet bunchberries grew , scattered like beads from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dead , pendulous branches of the firs , hoary with old man 's beard , were humid black . Ruth walked first , and Paul was fascinated by her little , evenly carried head , with a pale-blue scarf tied over it . She walked with a lithe step , her hips as controlled as a man 's . Toadstools , wide as a hand , crumpled and black as ink-soaked paper , exuded from the mold . " I hate them , " Ruth explained , kicking at them . They crossed by a bridge over a brook , where fern and jewelweed grew , and saw the watergigs circling below the riffle , their four legs and thorax magnified ten times by shadow on the sandy bottom . After a while the path began to climb , by rocks and roots for stairs , up Desert Mountain . Ruth climbed well and without assistance . Her slender legs seemed to extend endlessly from under the yellow linen skirt ; a patch of perspiration came upon her dress between her shoulders . The forest grew sparser , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still clung tatters of the night . The black , gnarled branches of the mountain-pine were piled with balls of splintered emerald . At last the trees stopped , and they followed the granite ridge , mottled with scales and lichen , while in the sockets of the rock , in the pulverized granite dust , beds of blueberries grew , and sage , and creeping yew and alder bushes . Stone cairns marked the trail . At every step the panorama opened wider and wider  --  the shoulder by which they had ascended , the bank of pointing tree tops in the valley , and then the horizon-rimmed Atlantic on which headlands and islands lay like coarse green lace . " This is Mount Ararat , " Ruth cried , " and that 's the flood receding , looking baby blue , as though it had n't rained for forty days and nights . " " Mount Ararat has neighbors , " Paul replied , pointing out the range of granite massifs parallel with Desert Mountain , and to the lake down in the gorge below them . " Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green parasites between the joints , and their long necks run down there to the sea , and all those little islands are their heads . " " Do n't talk about scaly , slimy things , " Ruth said , shivering . They descended the mountain by a precipitous trail that crossed and recrossed the tumbled bed of a brook , dry save for brown , stagnant pools , powdered with midges . They climbed carefully , watching their feet . Suddenly , sharply , Ruth screamed and darted backwards . Lying sluggishly in the path , head raised , was a smallbrownish snake , its throat bulging with a half-swallowed toad . The poor , stiff hind legs projected from the corners of the yellow mouth . The snake did not stir , but waited in rigid curves . Quicker than Paul could act , Ruth dropped a good-sized stone across its back . It writhed and frothed , disgorging the pulped toad , and Paul killed it . Ruth stared , white splotches in her cheeks , then trembled visibly and huddled into Paul 's arms in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the scarf slipped off . When the warmth of their bodies had commingled she ceased to cry . Tilting up her face , he kissed away the tears along both sides of her nose . She sniffed and laughed ; the soft lips closed , about to speak , and full upon the lax , surprised mouth he kissed her . Her lips gathered ; their strength came back , and while her body dropped , slowly she gave back the kiss . Then , even more slowly , her shoulders turned , and she pushed herself away , laughing uncertainly . " Look , " she said , eyeing the snake . " They say its tail wo n't die before sundown . " Then a moment later , when he dropped his arm , gravely she said , " We should n't have done that . " " No , " be admitted , too much perturbed to be gallant . All the silent way back , he heard a rattlesnake in every grasshopper 's whirr . He was irritated that Ruth should go swinging her scarf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strolled down to the fish-wharf . It was littered with empty oil barrels and a crated mast . Underneath , fish offal shone phosphorescently in the water . A carpenter 's shed ran out onto the wharf , with a settle backed against it where in the daytime fishermen loafed , and there they sat down . They watched a lopsided and bloody moon advance from behind the islands and flux toward them . A lobster-cage hammered against a float . The night was cold , and Ruth wrapped her tweed coat tightly and snuggled into Paul 's lap , drawing her feet up under her coat , while Paul placed his arm for a pillow . Themoonlight threw crooked shadows from her nose and blanched her hair frost-white . She lay so colorless without the sun that Paul was chilled . Lying warm against him , Ruth felt a small possessive ecstasy . She saw Paul 's face bent over her and suddenly she yearned for certitude . " Are you , " she asked , confident and sure , " are you in love with me ? " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mocking that Marjorie gave the question when she made him feel most like a boy , incapable of overcoming her . lie started , hesitated , and before he could choose a word to answer , he sensed Ruth 's softness go taut and her mouth sharpen . " What a strange question ! " " Strange ? " Ruth 's voice had an ironic dryness . " It 's strange that you should ask , " he said gently . " You know the answer to that question very well . " " Then why have n't you said so ? " Ruth sat up , away from him . " Does everything have to be said ? " " If you do n't want it to be misunderstood , it does . " She stung with shame . " I 'm cold . I 'm going home . " She walked swiftly , her head fixed straight before her . " Good-night , " she said on her steps , without turning . Paul went to the drugstore , bought a pack of cigarettes , and walked back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening primroses and yellow mullein stalks . " Damn it ! " he said , flinging away the stick . While he smoked , two couples , one after the other , came down the stairs to the wharf but , finding Paul there , turned away . He drew himself into a corner of the settle and shivered , oppressed . His plans had been overturned . No longer could he recite the equivocally tender farewell to a summer of innocent gaiety whose phrases had been unraveling in his mind . He felt wounded and offended at the impact of the prosaic word " love . " That tightening resentment which had gone through Ruth 's body , burning it like the touch of ice , frightened him . He was afraid of Ruth . He was afraid of that net of adult formulae by which immediately he conceived her to be entangling him . She did not understand the meanings that underlay , both supporting and contradicting , the formula . Love should grow like a tree in an open field , through time and earth , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost in consternation , he thought , perhaps she does love me . Perhaps the anarchy in which we have been enjoying each other is over . An unknown man came on to the wharf and climbed down the ladder at the end into a dinghy and rowed away into the impenetrableness of the harbor dark . Measurably , stroke by stroke , he diminished , the oars showing fainter and fainter , dipping and dripping into the far-off , melancholy sea . Perhaps , Paul thought , that unknown is Ruth , unconscious of the night , unconscious that she has parted from the earth upon an unstable element , bent , with the simplicity of an errand , bent upon me . He shook , and walked up and down , cringing at the sound of his own hollow footfalls , slowly penetrated with anger at his helplessness . He did not love her . He was without the urgency to respond to her . His curiosity over her young loveliness and incorruptibility was not love . If he loved anyone , he loved Marjorie . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet clearly he knew that he had and would continue to do both . To pretend to her , to receive young love with a beguiling face and a dry heart , even for a few days , disgusted him . Whatever he did , he would injure her . He was helpless . He threw his cigarette over the railing ; it hissed minutely in the ocean , and with the gesture he decided to do nothing . Innocence was a hardy thing and not stricken by a kiss and a word . He had been exaggerating and complicating an incident as capriciously unintegrated as her other moods , and he was rather tired . Perhaps even yet they might resume serenity and laughter . The next morning he did not happen upon Ruth , but in the afternoon they met as she was returning from the post office . She smiled ; her eyes were candid blue . Yesterday dissolved like an irrecallable dream . They delivered the mail to the doctor , and sauntered to Ruth 's house , where they surprised Rudolph nibbling at birch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rudolph back , but he retreated chittering from tree to tree . After he had gone Ruth went on shredding the catkins between her fingers , and they fell silent . Paul tried to arouse her by talking ; he asked questions about Jenny ; he mimicked the face with which Mr. Badger in the drugstore turned on the carbonated-water spigot . The conversation failed . " I do n't know what is the matter with me , " Ruth admitted . " The cat has got my tongue for sure . " A palpable constraint came between them . When Paul understood that he could not enliven her he went away . In the days that followed , although they often saw each other and at times quickened and joyed in their old intimacy , always after a while Ruth became silent , and the constraint returned . Ruth felt the division too , but the babbling charm of her speech was spontaneous , and she could not order it . In these moments , inert with brittle silence , Paul studied her . When she was not talking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interposing parentheses and commas of laughter , half of her loveliness was gone . The eyes were too small ; the face , soft as unimpressed wax , too placid ; the body lank and immature . She put on a yellow chiffon dress , overlaid with large roses , and French heels . She did not know how to walk on French heels ; her ankles stiffened and occasionally turned , while her arms contracted awkwardly . Ruth was conscious that she did not please him . Every word that came into her head seemed to her insignificant before she spoke . When embarrassed she assumed a set of manners , a raised intonation of the voice , a stilted motion . " What has got into me ? " she repeated anxiously to herself . On the morning when she appeared with green-glass ear-rings , Paul lost patience and scolded her . He did not refer to the ear-rings . " You have been listening to Jenny Vernay , " he said , severely . " She has been putting ideas into your head . " " Jenny is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will be true for you always . Anything that Jenny or people like Jenny advise you to do will be wrong for you What she proposes might be wise for Jenny , but for you it will always be inappropriate . " These accusations confused Ruth . " Jenny is a nice girl . " " Jenny is a vulgar blatherskite . " They quarreled restrainedly , and Paul left . Huddled on the stone , Ruth wept quietly , without even wondering , as the slow tears started , why she was crying . The morning was overcast with clouds . When Rudolph joyed and chattered , running back and forth along a bough , she did not lift her head . After a while , daintily between the trees , came wisps of fog , blowing and dispersing inland before the wind , cooling her face as though a handkerchief had touched it . The fog thickened ; it drifted and unwound and misted all the gloom beneath the evergreens until Ruth sat in an imponderable white pocket , where now and then and slowly the heart-shaped yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth . Ruth unscrewed the ear-rings , and flung them among the trees . Paul began to go for long walks atone among the mountains , starting immediately after breakfast and carrying his lunch . In the evenings he read in his room or slipped down to the fish-wharf and smoked on the settle . After one or two couples descended the stairs and retreated , vexed at discovering him , he came back to the hotel . Several times during the day , when he returned from his walks , he encountered Ruth , waiting as by accident on the path , and they walked back side by side through a diminishing conversation . Paul suspected the men loitering before the post office of making unpleasant comments on her devotion . Then one afternoon he met Ruth on the street ; she snubbed him , the soft chin stiffened and the eyebrows absurdly raised . He whistled gently with relief . That evening after supper he wandered down toward the fish-wharf . He met Jenny on the way . " I know where you 're going , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke cigarettes . I 'd think you 'd freeze . " " The moon , sweet Genevieve , doth keep me warm . " The moon had not risen , but the wharf projected its rectangular black hollowness over the sea . Everywhere , against the rocks , around the piles , the sound of creeping , lapping water awed and saddened him . He became an old man remembering an episode of his youth . How very young , he mused , to complicate a summer 's flirtation , to interrogate the meaningless confidences of a garrulous child , the brief accidental flowering of young flesh ! In his mind , at the memory of her , he saw a portion of a green linen dress , rumpled by the body beneath it . Was this meaningless fragment her residual image ? One by one , concentrating , he recalled other fragment &; With a rush of exquisite pleasure , the sense of a moment embalmed in crystal , he saw in entirety Ruth sleeping on the flat rock beside the sea , with the straight shadow beside her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the images hover , transfuse , waver , and attenuate into the strange , inexplicable essence that exhaled from her , penetrating his body like a cool perfume . Into his reverie interrupted conversation . A man and a woman came down the steps to the wharf . Paul involuntarily hid his cigarette in his hand ; then he recognized the quick-breathed laughter . It was Ruth . The couple walked down the wharf , arm in arm , whispering , and Paul saw that Jimmy McCrae was with her . Almost in front of him , but near the railing , they stopped ; Ruth stood close to McCrae and drew his arm around her . For a moment they faced , kindling with low laughter , then McCrae kissed her , and she leaned into his arms . Paul sensed one of Jenny 's tricks , but anger stung him as though he were seeing Ruth debauched . " Stop it , you little fool ! " He confronted her . For a long moment they stared fiercely at each other . Ruth suddenly whimpered as though she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran along the wharf , and leaped , ten black feet down , into the ocean . The splash freed McCrae and Paul . They ran after her . MeCrae dived , while Paul climbed down the ladder . Together they dragged her up . She lay face downward on the floor of the wharf , sodden and choking , and sobbed inconsolably . When Paul tried to get her to stand she shook off his hand . " Oh , go away , " she cried , " please go away ! Please go away , and never , never come back ! " Paul cut his vacation two days short , and the next afternoon , despite the fog , he left on the boat for Rockland . Jenny Vernay saw him off . The fog , dispersing inland before the wind , misting all the gloom beneath the evergreens , enfolded the steamer in an imponderable white pocket , melted and illumined by the sheeted sunlight on a gray , smooth sea , where now and again and evenly the engines stroked like an unperplexed heart . WE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy in this little straight-up square house on the rolling moors . It is like a child 's drawing of a house on crumpled yellow paper . If all the sheep that used to live in this house when it was a barn Came trotting and huddling in a great woolly crowd over the hill , Shouting baa baa and each ringing a little resurrection bell under his throat , That would not sound so happy as we have been all summer long under the sheep 's roof . The wind can not blow so happy , though he sounds a high note like bright fire through the screened window beside our beds . The great sea can not say it with his blue swinging and hushed thunderous murmur along the low still shore . Even the mist that blows in from the sea , the mist that sweeps over the moors like a murmur , Speaks nothing , though coming so near with his farness away . And the little pine grove that will not grow high because it is bound to be strong and green , And the huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese poem but never go in t hey have not noticed how the flower of our joy grew here and blossomed all summer witland any more reason than the sky has . And nothing they could do with their solemnly far wandering wings , Or the kingbirds with their tiny wings that quiver like sunbeams , Or the humming-birds whose wings are invisible and sing , Or I , a poet , with rhythm and meaning upon my tongue , would tell forth our happiness , And so I have only spoken these words , and I will save them for you like a child 's drawing on a piece of paper .
