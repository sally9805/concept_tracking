Not for the sensible State of Ohio such harebrained schemes as California 's Ham &; Eggs , such a treasury-busting law as Colorado 's . Safe &; sound sat Ohio full of colleges and memories of Presidents . But last week , in spite of its stout constitution and sound heredity , Ohio was scared stiff that it might be going crazy . What scared Ohio was not only a bogey called the Bigelow Plan . Worse was the bogeyman himself-Herbert Seely Bigelow . <P> Shaggy-haired , 69-year-old Bogeyman Bigelow was a Congregational minister who , after taking over a Cincinnati church in 1896 , leased it to a burlesque house , later founded his own " People 's Church . " In 1917 he was horsewhipped for pacifist preachings . Cincinnati knows him chiefly as a chameleon of political thought . He has been a Coughlinite , a Townsendite , an Independent on the City Council , onetime Democratic candidate for Secretary of State , Republican candidate for a seat in the General Assembly , an elected Democrat to the Assembly , in 1936 an elected Democrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After May 7 , 1940 his Plan guaranteed an income of $50 a month to every Ohioan who had passed his 60th birthday and found himself without gainful employment ; $80 a month to similarly eligible married couples . Estimated eligibles : 700,000 . <P> Cost of the plan , by Bigelow figuring : $60,000,000 a year. * Tax provisions in the Plan would fix that , said he . The Plan called for a State income tax equal to one-fourth the Federal levy , a new 2% tax on land valuations of more than $20,000 an acre . So vaguely drawn was this financing feature that critics ' estimates of how much could be raised varied by millions . Bigelow himself refused to be drawn into the argument , went frighteningly on about his business . <P> His business was to get his Plan before the people , to be voted on November 7 as an amendment to the State Constitution . To put it on the ballot , he needed 10% of the voters in the State . He got them : 241,288 valid signatures . By the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present law so that the process of amending the constitution would not be so laborious in the future . <P> Politicians asked each other in whispers whether Bigelow could summon up enough referendum votes to make him a prospective candidate for Governor . Said his campaign director , Charles H. Hubbell : " The amendments will be approved at the polls and then the people of Ohio will elect as their Governor the man who conceived them . " <P> <P> * More businesslike estimate : $310,000,000 . State 's entire budget for 1939 and 1940 : $300,000,000.
