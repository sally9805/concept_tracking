" COMING , SIR ! " - Dave Marlowe-Lippincott ( $2.50 ) . <P> What goes on behind a waiter 's poker face ? Many a nervous , exasperated or curious diner has often wondered . Last week a waiter took off his uniform and tried to tell . What he had to say was disappointing . Thirty-year-old Dave Marlowe ( real name : Arthur Timmens ) has been a ship 's steward on British and U. S. liners , a waiter in New York speakeasies and night clubs , has worked in swanky London hotels , in rowdy pubs . But apparently he paid as little attention to the guests as they paid to him . As a ship 's steward his main concern was with bootlegging and his amusements on shore . As a speak-easy and night-club waiter he was mostly interested in the gangster clientele , one of whom he saw shot down one night . <P> Waiter Marlowe found it hard to get used to the poor wages and strait-jacket discipline of English waiters , but harder to stomach the double-dyed snobbery of his fellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to go to sea again . Three months after her maiden voyage he made a trip on the Queen Mary . It was his hardest job . Eighteen-hour shifts , plus the teeth-rattling vibration in crew quarters directly over the propellers , made him pine for land once more . <P> For most guests Author Marlowe shows astonishing tolerance . ( After a charity ball in London , which kept him on his feet 19 hours at a halfpenny an hour , he could still spare a sympathetic thought for the hangovers in store for the revelers . ) Main bane of waiters , says Marlowe , is tipping . On this practice he lays most of the blame for the miserable working conditions of the profession generally . Do waiters judge a man 's character by the size of his tip ? Says Waiter Marlowe : They do . <P> Arriving in Manhattan last week , Author Marlowe revealed that he has banked $5,000 since his book appeared , has contracts for two more , and will never wait on another table as long as he lives .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
