txt The operation of the BorahGlass amendment , which permits national banks to issue currency on the basis of United States Government bonds bearing not more than S 'S interest , is being seriously hampered by doubtful provisions of the law . The controversial points involve the tax on national banks for the use of the privilege and the meaning of the three-year provision in the law . Banks have hesitated to make extensive us. of the privilege , pending official interpretation of the provisions , which arc to be finally settled by Attorney General Mitchell in a private ruling for the Comptroller of the Currency . The Solicitor General has already ruled that the tax is the same as that applied under Section 5214 of the revised statute for use of the circulating privilege extended to Panama 2s , which is 14 of 1% . The Solicitor General also ruled that the three-year privilege means that at any time within three years after enactment of the law banks may place bonds for note circulation , and that the bonds need not be redeemed until they mature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney General must yet decide on the tv  --  o points . The old law . which applied prior to the issuance of the consols , provided a Lax of 1 . , Because of the low interest on the consols , this was reduced of of 1,1 ' . The Glass-Borah amendment provided by general reference that the new currency should be issued under th.i same terms and circumstances as when the 2 ' ; ' consols were used . The question was whether the reference was to the 1 or the ' 2 of 1C. tax . The Solicitor General ruled that the tax under the new law should be ' 2 of 1 ' ? , payable semi-annually , on the amount of outstanding notes in circulation . Some banks interpreted the second point to mean that the privilege remained in force fur three years from date of enactment , and that after July . 1935 , the bonds would have to be redeemed by the banks and the currency cancelled . Others contended that the provision meant that national banks may at any time during the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds specified for note circulation , and that the bonds need not be redeemed and the currency retired until the maturity of the bonds . Controversy Has Lasted Weeks The socicitor general ruled that the latter infterprelation was correct and so recommended to the attorney general . The attorney general is usually guided by the findings of the solicitor general , but has sometimes overruled him . Officials have been uncommunicative over the controversy , which has been alive since the enactment of the law in the middle of July . The lack of enthusiasm on the part of banks failing to take advantage of the privilege extended under the Class-Sorab amendment is now understood . It is estimated that under the new law $905. - 000,000 in new currency may be issued on the basis of United States bonds bearing interest not greater than 31 , V ; ; : . Officials state that less than $2,000,000 has been issued so far . It may now be anticipated that when the opinion of the attorney general is made public through the Treasury Department , banks will be more eager than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the possibility that the bonds need not be redeemed and currency retired within three years after enactment of the law . The interpretation placed on the law by members of Congress during consideration of the proposal was that in three years the currency would-be retired .
