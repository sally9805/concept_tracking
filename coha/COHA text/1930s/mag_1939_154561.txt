Electrical-equipment manufacturers employ laboratory researchers , for the good reason that they want to find better ways of producing power , better ways of protecting power on transmission lines . One of the perennial problems of research laboratories is frictional heat in the generators . Another is the major menace to transmission lines-lightning . <P> In Pittsburgh last week the Westinghouse laboratories announced a new type of lightning recorder . Called a " fulchronograph , " it gives a complete picture of a lightning stroke 's intensity , from start to finish . Essential feature is a wheel with 400 iron fins on its rim , revolving at 3,400 r.p.m . A lightning arrester no bigger than a quart-size fruit jar receives the bolt , discharges it harmlessly through its coils . In these coils the lightning sets up a varying magnetic field in which the fulchronograph wheel spins . Each iron fin of the fulchronograph is magnetized according to the intensity of the field at the moment it passes through , and the result is an intensity chart of the lightning bolt every 40 microseconds ( millionths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frederick Wagner and his coworkers , the fulchronograph has been tried out on top of the University of Pittsburgh 's skyscraper Cathedral of Learning . The record of one bolt passing through the arrester and dissected by the fulchronograph shows that it reached a crest of 21,000 amperes , then fell rapidly ( in 100 microseconds ) to 1,000 amperes , and from that point more slowly to zero . From start to finish the flash lasted one-sixtieth of a second . Engineer Wagner intends to acquire a complete gallery of different types of bolt , then redesign the arresting equipment on transmission lines in accordance with what he learns . <P> Previous-lightning measurement has relied mainly on the oscillograph , which records the changing intensity of a bolt by means of an oscillating electron beam playing on photographic film . The fulchronograph is not only cheaper to use , says Westinghouse , but furnishes a clearer lightning picture . <P> General Electric researchers , who for years have studied lightning bolts striking Manhattan 's Empire State Building , showed more interest last week in hydrogen-cooling for generators at the powerhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it circulates with much less friction than air . As a result of cooling generators by hydrogen rather than air , the power output per pound of fuel is increased by 20% , and the fuel saving on a 200,000-kilowatt unit tots up to $20,000 a year . There is no fire or explosion hazard , because oil seals keep the hydrogen purity in the cooling chamber above 98% , and hydrogen will not ignite without more of an air mixture than that . <P> The first hydrogen-cooled generator got into action at Dayton , Ohio less than two years ago , but G.E . has now installed nine units , with a combined output of more than a half-million kilowatts . There have been no " outages " or shutdowns on these through failure of the hydrogen-cooling system .
