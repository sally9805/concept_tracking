Last week in Modern Medicine , Dr. Bayard Taylor Horton and associates* of the Mayo Clinic at Rochester , Minn* announced a new method of treating the " constant , excruciating , burning , boring " headaches of chronic alcoholics . When the system is flooded with alcohol , large amounts of histamine , a protein derivative , pour into the blood stream . Somehow , said the doctors , the histamine expands blood vessels in the head , causes hangover headaches . Strangely enough , they found that " immunizing " injections of minute quantities of histamine brought permanent relief to 65 patients , no improvement to ten patients . <P> <P> *Drs .
