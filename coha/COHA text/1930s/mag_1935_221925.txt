Last week , for the first time this season , the New York Philharmonic Symphony played some music by a U. S. composer . For Conductor Otto Klemperer it was a matter of duty to give a hearing to native talent . For the man thus honored it was an opportunity to keep prominent company with Bach , Ravel , Brahms . The composer Conductor Klemperer picked was Roy Harris , whom admirers regard as the strong White Hope of modern U. S. music . Last week 's offering was not Harris ' most ambitious work but When Johnny Comes Marching Home , an eight-minute " American Overture , " commissioned and recorded a year ago by RCA Victor Co . <P> Theme was the thumping old Civil War tune which sounded out rowdily at first , drove its way through elaborate orchestration , occasionally groaning , occasionally sighing , never quite reaching a definite conclusion . Composer Harris had chosen the tune because it was what his father had whistled in the mornings when he went striding out to his farmlands , in the evenings when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " roughhewn , sinewy and directly outspoken . " In his dry , blunt speech . Composer Harris makes much of his background , of the fact that he was born 38 years ago in an Oklahoma log cabin which his father hewed by hand , of his own early years spent farming in California 's San Gabriel Valley . At the age when most would-be composers are hard at their technical training , Roy Harris was soldiering . When the War was over he went West again , drove a farm truck . He studied briefly at the University of California where his first interest was philosophy , which he deserted when he found it was just " word juggling . " He turned gropingly toward music because for him it had an absolute value . <P> Even those who fail to appreciate him admit that Roy Harris has worked like one possessed . His first compositions were as crude as a schoolboy 's but within three years he had written an Andante which was performed at the Philharmonic Stadium concerts . That was followed by a Guggenheim Fellowship which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he picked up sophisticated technique but he kept his drive and a bit of the ungainliness which he has never quite outgrown . Luck was with him when rich Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge sponsored his chamber music , when her imports , the Pro Arte Quartet from Belgium and the Roth Quartet from Budapest , decided that his was virile U. S. music which was well worth playing widely . Two years ago the Boston Symphony played Harris ' Symphony : 1933 . <P> The case of serious U. S. music remains a difficult one to try . In theory , audiences are eager to keep in touch with what is being written . In practice they usually seem bored or completely baffled by scores which they hear once and seldom ever again . Critics are of little help when they attempt to pass judgment . When Symphony : 1933 was played in Boston , the late Henry Taylor Parker said in the Transcript : " The first movement gives off an American eagerness and boldness and exuberance - of the West rather than the East , where a too insistent gospelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surcharged though it is with an inexhaustibly varied counter point , marches gallantly , confidently . . . .
