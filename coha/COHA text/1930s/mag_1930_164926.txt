God , politics , two women and the stock-market have been among the vital interests of Bishop James Cannon Jr . of the Methodist Episcopal Church , South . All of his brethren deplored his gambling in stocks , and at the Dallas convention of his church last spring , he tearfully promised to gamble no more , was forgiven ( TIME , May 26 et seq . ) . But four of his brethren in the South still deplored his conduct in general , which they felt unfitted him for the service of God . While he was honeymooning in Brazil with the second of the two women who have been dear to him , these Southerners instituted an inquiry by a court of elders to see if Bishop Cannon should be unfrocked ( TIME , Sept. 29 ) . Because of his conspicuous activity in public affairs ( " The Prohibishop " is the Philadelphia Record 's nickname for him ) and because of his repeated private appearances in the news , the Press of the land has watched his career closely . Knowing well that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most dangerous news creatures there is , most of the Press has been cautious . Unafraid , however , have been Publisher William Randolph Hearst and the Patterson-McCormick combine of Chicago . Both thoroughly Wet , neither of them deeply religious , both these powers of the Press have investigated the Prohibishop boldly , intimately . Last week , with his spiritual trial in Virginia yet to stand , Bishop Cannon turned sharply on one of his observers . He sued William Randolph Hearst , personally , for $5,000,000 for " false , scandalous , defamatory and malicious libel . " <P> The Bishop does not object legally to newspaper accounts of his meeting and friendship with Mrs. Helen Hawley McCallum of Manhattan , who last year accompanied him to Palestine as secretary and last summer to England in the same capacity , and whom he married last July . <P> But he does object to a Hearst report : " On the night before his first wife Lura Virginia Bennett Cannon died , about two years ago , Bishop Cannon visited Mrs. McCallum in her apartment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons , who were at their mother 's bedside in Washington . <P> When he learned his wife 's condition was critical , he took the next train home . " All false , pleads the Bishop , and suggestive of " improper , unseemly and immoral conduct . " He denies that he was at Mrs. McCallum 's apartment that night . <P> Nor has he objected to newspaper reports of his conduct aboard ship upon his recent return from Brazil - the apparent indifference of the newly married couple to each other in public ; their seldom being seen together ; her going to breakfast long after him , his leaving the table long before her ; her traveling as " Mrs. Helen Hawley McCallum , " his traveling as " Mr. " Cannon ; neither of them attending any ship 's religious service . <P> But he does object to the Hearst papers stating that he tried to prevent the conviction of Harry L. Goldhurst , the Man hattan bucketeer who handled the Bishop 's stock account and who now is serving a five-year sentence in Atlanta Penitentiary. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
