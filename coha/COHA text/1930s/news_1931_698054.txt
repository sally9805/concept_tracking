txt Mahatma Gandhi explained to a large audience of Indians yesterday that he was undecided about going to London for the Round Table Conference . His first decision not to participate in the second conference unless the communal problem in India was settled was unkindly Interpreted , he said , by the American and British press " as a means for backing out of the Delhi pact . " , " By the terms of that pact , " the Mahatma declared , " I gave my soletim word that I would go to London , but it is necessary that there should be a certain atmosphere for my going . First of all , I must be assured that the Indian peasants will not suffer in my absence at the hands of the Government . Secondly , I want to feel certain that the Government will carry out all the terms of the Delhi truce , and , thirdly , I would like , to feel that there will be peace among the various racial communities while I am absent . " The highest government officials assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must have concrete acts in that direction , not mere words . " Referring to the recurrence of racial conflicts between the Indians themselves , the Mahatma said in part : " This disgraceful affair , when people who had done no wrong to anybody were pounced upon and belabored , when brother attacked brother like a savage , has gone to my heart . " The outside world will believe we are at war among ourselves and are unfit for self-government . " " How can we , torn from within , " Gandhi asked , " attain swaraj ? " This term means home rule . It was learned later that questions raised by Gandhi as conditions precedent to his participation in the London conference are now under discussions between Bombay and other governments .
