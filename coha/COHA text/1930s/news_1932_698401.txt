txt I am a reader of your paper and usually vote the Republican ticket . I do n't believe I have ever read in your paper an editorial so full of " blah " and " bunk " as your leading editorial today . The man who wrote this editorial must have been told to do it , for surely no man of average intelligence could have done it and been sincere and honest . To many of us fairly young , who have sat by and watched our savings dwindle away when we thought we had put them into the safest investments in the world , your editorial does not sound very good . You must either feel that we are all a lot of children or of very little intelligence . Your editorial sounds like a pep talk of some hot-air advertising man or sales manager instructing some cub salesman . Why not cut out all the " bunk " and tell people honestly and sincerely that we have been " taken for a buggy ride " by , the English , French and Germans ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it funny though tragic ?
