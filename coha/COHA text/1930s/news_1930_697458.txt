txt In a cloud of unfulfilled ' hopes the Imperial Conference of 1930 came to an end today with the dominions defeated on tariffs but victorious on constitutional issues . The best the dominions could obtain on the economic side was an agreement to extend by three years the existing margin of British tariff preferences . In return only South Africa agreed to extend existing preferences to Britain for the same length of time . Otherwise the dominions met utter failure in their attempt to establish reciprocal tariff preferences throughout the Empire and some of them went ahead making limited tariff agreements with each other . Canada and South Africa , for example , have reached agreement on South African sugar , while Australia , New Zealand and Canada are likely to conclude similar bargains among themselves . None of these agreements will benefit Britain . On the constitutional side , however , the dominions scored notable triumphs in their struggle for absolute equality with the United Kingdom .

Ring to Name Governors General , The long agitation over GovernorsGeneral has been ended and the King now has the right to appoint them in consultation with his dominion Ministers alone . The British Government will not interfere unless it is asked for advice . Thus the road is opened at last for the appointment of native-born Governors General if the dominions wish to have them . It is interesting that King George personally played a decisive part in deciding what his new power 's should be . Other decisions on minor subjects were announced today with the final adjournment of the conference . Chief of these was that completion of the Singapore naval base will be postponed five years . This will not prevent ' fulfillment of the present building contract , as the postponement relates only to expenditure for equipment and defense , nor will it interfere with completion of the great aviation base now under way .

From the speeches of Premiers Scullin of Australia and Bennett of Canada today it was apparent that both of these dominions favor wheat quotas in principle for marketing their ? products in the United Kingdom . The Canadian Premier assured the delegates of a warm welcome when they arrived in Ottawa for next year 's meeting , which - he predicted . would be of immense significance for the empire . . He repeated his conviction that a high tariff policy was the best for Canada and that his scheme of empire preferences was best for the empire .

" Mr. Scullin saw in the " constitutional decisions of the conference its claim to have accomplished something durable for the empire . " It is very easy to make a declaration of principle , " said the Australian Prime ' Minister , " but it is much more difficult to put that principle into effect . It has ' remained for this conference to translate the declaration of the conference of 1926 into acts , and it remains for the whole of the parliaments of-the various countries in the British- Commonwealth to express their views on what we have done . I believe we have made very large strides . " The economic side of the conference has by no means been a failure .

Because of the long constitutional dispute in the dominions on the question of Governors General , the full text of the conference decision was read with especial interest tonight . It is as follows : " The parties interested in the appointment of a Governor General of a dominion are his Majesty the King . whose representative he is , and the dominion concerned . " The constitutional practice that his Majesty acts on , the advice Of responsible Ministers , applies also in this instance . " The Ministers who tender and are responsible for . such advice are his Majesty 's Ministers in the dominions concerned . " The Ministers concerned tender their formal advice after informal consultation with his Majesty .

LONDON , Nov. 14 ( P ) . ? The scattered dominions of the British Empire emerged from the concluding session of the imperial conference today full partners with the motherland in a commonwealth of nations . " The Dominion of Great Britain , " was the way Jim Thomas , Secretary of State for Dominions , explained to newspaper men the new status assigned England , Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland . " We are a dominion now and I wish to emphasize that status , " he said , half humorously and half seriously . He pointed out that in 1926 Great Britain was a predominant partner in the British Commonwealth , but now was a partner coequally with Canada , Australia , New Zealand , South Africa , Newfoundland and the Irish Free State . Although under the new plan Great Britain becomes an equal partner with the dominions , undivided loyalty to the throne and the British monarch was attested by the delegates . It was explained that under . the new plan the King actually becomes the monarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history and language . India 's hope of attaining a similar status was voiced by Sir Muhammad Shafti , spokesman for the Indian delegation , who said the whole of India , including its ? princes and its people , is - looking forward to co-partnership in the empire . Singapore Base to Be Completed : The Royal Air Force works in connection with the great naval base scheme at Singapore will be completed and existing work on the great new Singapore dockyard will be continued , but new work on the naval aspects of the base will be postponed for five years . The work being continued is known as the Jackson ' contract , which calls for expenditure of roughly $38,000 , - 000 upon the new dockyard , which may be used by merchant vessels and liners . The great floating dock built in England and towed out to Singapore has been in use for some time . The Malay States have contributed $10,000,000 toward the cost of the base ; New Zealand $5,000,000 and Hongkong $1,250,000 , much of which has already been disbursed . While the southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed to completion , it is considered generally satisfactory that no complete stoppage of work has been decided upon , such as resulted when the first ' Labor Government went into " office in 1924 , in which case considerable loss would have resulted on account of compensation to contractors . The Labor Government of 1924 decided not to proceed With the base , but under the Conservative regime of 1924-29 the new floating dock had been provided and the Jackson contract signed . Consequently in November , 1929 , the new Labor Administration slowed down the work contracted pending the naval conference early this year . Since that decision the position had been one of uncertainty . Out of an estimated total expenditure of $43,000,000 a total of $12 , - 500,000 had been expended up to July of this year , A. V. Alexander , First Lord of the Admiralty , announced in the House of Commons some months ago . Defends - Position . BEDFORD , England , Nov. 14 M. ? Premier told . an audience here tonight that it would be impossible for any British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax the English people 's food and raw materials for their factories . His remarks were in reply to criticisms that his government failed to get economic benefits out of the Imperial Conference . " I see it is said this evening that we failed to get dominion markets because we believe in dogmas , " said the Premier . " I do not care about dogmas . I am ' for facing the facts . We say it is absolutely impossible . for any government of this country ? Labor , Conservative , or Liberal ? honestly to tell the Prime Ministers of the dominions that the people of this country , faced with a fiscal policy that diminishes their foreign trade , will agree to impose taxation upon the food of the people or the raw materials of our factories . " Mr. then disclosed that the government intends to restore the unemployment insurance " dole " to an insurable basis . He said the Labor Government did not take the dole off that basis . " It is one of our inheritances , " he charred.  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
