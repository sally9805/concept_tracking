More members of labor unions throughout the world are affiliated with the Second ( Socialist ) International than with any other group . Its secretary is Dr. Friedrich Wolfgang Adler , an Austrian who in 1917 was convicted of assassinating the then Austrian Imperial Chancellor , Count Strgkh , but was amnestied . Socialist workers throughout the world have long known that Dr. Adler always carries an extra forged passport in the name of " Al Frey " in addition to his own , but Rotterdam police have not . They know Dr. Adler well and one day last August , when he handed them his forged passport by mistake , they arrested him . In vain Dr. Adler continued to protest right up to last week that " it is for use only in Germany and Italy . " An unsympathetic Dutch court last week sentenced him to four months in jail .
