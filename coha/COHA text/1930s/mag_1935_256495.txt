Last August Secretary of Agriculture Wallace , surveying a map of 1,100 counties in 22 states burned crisp by Drought , remarked that a food shortage was not nearly so serious as a feed shortage . Last week the feed shortage had produced what looked very much like a food shortage . To be sure , there was enough wheat for bread , potatoes were plentiful and the fruit and vegetable crops were good . But for the first time in years consumption of beef and pork had practically overtaken supply . <P> According to Government figures , cattle &; calves on the hoof totaled 60,667,000 last Jan. 1 , as against 68,290,000 one year before , a decrease of 11% . Within the same twelvemonth Drought and AAA 's corn-hog program reduced the number of hogs 35% , from 57,177,000 to 37,007,000 , smallest in 50 years . Sheep and lambs , least affected by Drought , were down some 5% to 49,766,000 last January . Out of proportion to these decreases in supply were the increases in price paid by the packer . Hogs that cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week . For cattle he paid 50% more last week than for the same week last year . <P> Slowly through the winter , while the meat supply was dwindling , the price to the consumer was creeping up .

Last week a housewives ' boycott broke out again , this time in New York City . <P> A horde of plain Eastside housewives , chanting " down with high meat prices ! " invaded the distributing plants of Wilson &; Co. and United Dressed Beef Co . In The Bronx 2,000 women volunteering as pickets succeeded in closing down more than 1,000 meat shops . In Brooklyn a poultry dealer named William Sheeger carried a chicken home for supper . Pickets , mistaking him for a customer who would not join the boycott , hurled a rock through his window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the strike spread to some nonkosher operators . Strike leaders claimed that more than 4,000 shops had been closed . Meatmen put the figure at about 12% of that number . <P> Prime organizer of the strike was a Bronx housewife named Mrs. Sarah Licht , secretary of City Action Committee Against the High Cost of Living . Money was raised through open air meetings at which members contributed dimes , nickels , pennies . A Labor society called the United Council of Working Class Women helped out . Demanding a flat reduction of 10 per lb. in all meat prices , Housewife Licht &; associates pointed to the following comparison of last week 's meat prices in New York City with the same week last year : <P>
