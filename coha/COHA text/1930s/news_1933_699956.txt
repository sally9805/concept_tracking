txt CANADIAN POOR AID Number of Persons Receiving Relief Expected to Be Down to 1,000,000 Soon . MORE WORK IS AVAILABLE Dominion Moves for Drastic Reduction in Expense of Caring for Needy . By V. M. FLIPP Editorial Correspondence . THE NEW YOBS Tams . OTTAWA , July ** June 1 , 1,500,000 Canadians were on the relief lists , supported wholly or in part from the public funds . By July 1 , the number had been reduced by 200,000 , and the present month has seen so sharp a reduction that it is estimated that by Aug. 1 the figure will not greatly exceed 1,000,000 . This cut of one-third in relief recipients is to some extent a measure of the Dominion 's progress back to normal conditions , but It still will leave one individual out of ten a complete or partial public charge . At this moment the Dominion , Provincial and municipal governments are spending at the rate of about $100,000,000 a year for relief . Since this obviously is a condition which can not continue indefinitely , the government is determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways : 1 . By clearing the relief list of the inevitable grafters and impostors , the " wo n't works , " on the theory that a man who refuses to work for his living when work is to be had should be permitted to starve if he feels that way about it ; 2 . By lending every encouragement and aid to recipients of relief who would be delighted to find jobs  --  and this class is in the great majority . 3 . By assisting the municipalities and Provinces in labor costs on public works , but not on the cost of materials . Guarding Against Rackets . The government is firm in its resolve that relief shall not be permitted to become a " racket " ; nor will it sanction any policy by which the citizens are mollycoddled or pauperized . For the past two years industry and business have been so utterly flat that there was not much any agency could do save meet the emergency from day to day . There are now , however , definite signs of economic revival . Particularly is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but many oth lines are taking on more workers , booking satisfactory orders . Therefore it is held that the time is opportune for former workers now on relief to make a renewed effort at self-support . Direct family relief is administered in Canada through the municipalities on a scale approved by each Provincial government . The municipality pays the cost of administration , but expenditures for food , rent , clothing and fuel are shared equally by municipality , Province and the Dominion . Relief Scheme Changed . In the elaborate scheme with which Canada met the first onslaughts of the depression three years ago the Dominion undertook to pay one-third of approved public works undertaken by municipalities , the Province and the municipalities each contributing equally . Experience proved very quickly that whatever its moral advantages this plan was ruinously expensive . A large proportion of the money went for materials , all parties concerned were being burdened with debt , heavy maintenance charges were created , the normal building program of the future mortgaged and the amount of created labor was disproportionate to the expenditure . The Dominion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on approved projects of a useful and necessary type . No extra vacant structures will be sanctioned . and it will be expected that so far as practicable men now on relief shall be employed . The very considerable reduction in State-supported individuals during the past two or three months has come about largely in Eastern Canada and more specifically in the Maritime Provinces and the industrial areas of Quebec and Ontario . The cities of Western Canada and the Pacific Coast , less highly industrialized , are slower to feel the improvement , but a better business tone is spreading and the remarkable advance in grain prices has had the effect of a bracing tonic on the prairies , even though the new crop will be far short of its early promise . It is particularly noteworthy that the national improvement , showing itself now in directions , has come about without artificial stimulus . Unquestionably there has been considerable indirect benefit from the pdiicy pursued in the United States , with results seemingly so satisfactory , but the government of Canada has adhered to its belief that the less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor is this improvement any longer a matter of theory . Railroad and canal earnings and car loadings are consistently better than they were a year ago , and these are significant indices .
