Since last spring heavy rains have swollen the two rivers that writhe clear across China : deep Yangtze and wide , slow Hwang Ho or Yellow River which 81 years ago shifted its entire course from the south to the north side of the Shantung Peninsula . Government experts last month warned China 's millions that " almost inevitably " the Hwang Ho would writhe out of its new retaining dikes ( many feet above the surrounding terrain ) back to its old course ( TIME , July 3 ) . Last week the Hwang Ho broke its dikes in a dozen places in Shantung and Honan Provinces , flipped out tentative feelers of yellow water . Like a wandering serpent , one mile-wide flood flailed ponderously across Honan Province . Where the old and new beds of the Hwang Ho fork , roily water slupped around the cities of Chengchow , Lanfeng and Kaifeng , drowning 1,000 working peasants at one gulp near the latter .
