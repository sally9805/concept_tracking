txt Delightfully Uncertain . Noting your recent editorial references to the Uncertainty Principle of Heisenberg , it occurred to me that possibly it might not be generally realized how delightfully uncertain this principle is . It has been stated in various ways , but the following , from Science , seems to carry the maximum of uncertainty : " One of the philosophically intriguing consequences of the new-wave mechanics in physics is the Uncertainty Principle of Heisenberg , who , in 1927 , pointed out that it is posible to measure the exact position of a small particle , such as an electron , only at the expense of uncertainty as to its position . This principle of indetermination has been more disturbing to the older physical concepts than even the principle of relativity . " Intriguing the proposition may be , but why disturbing ? Has it not rather a sedative or hypnotic effect , like a message from Mrs. Eddy or Gertrude Stein ? Like a Modernist picture , it is equally lucid upside down or sideways , Brooklyn , Feb. 23 , 1935 . F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
