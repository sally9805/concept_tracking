NEW YORK Peace in Pocantico <P> " I remember most unhappily , " wrote John D. Rockefeller Jr . last week , " the protracted tax litigation between my father and the village of North Tarrytown , N. Y. Although it resulted in his favor , it left my father a feeling of hurt and injury that I think never quite disappeared . " Whether or not he expected to end feeling hurt or injured , Mr. Rockefeller six years ago took court action to have the 1934 assessed valuation ( $2,619 , 890 ) on his North Tarrytown property , including a corner of his vast Pocantico Hills estate reduced . <P> He too was successful , winning last August a reduction of $502,721 . Town officials , who would have to make refund , and who faced similar litigation for the years 1935 to 1939 , calculated they would have to write their neighbor a check for some $50,000 . <P> Last week , however , Mr. Rockefeller declared he would waive the refund ( except half the $6,705 litigation cost ) and forget any further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the readjusted one for 1934 , and if he could be assured that henceforth he would not be discriminated against . <P> " It opens up a new era in good feeling between the village and Mr. Rockefeller . ' ' said Mayor Edward A. Martin , hastily accepting these terms .
