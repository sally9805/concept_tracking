 | The horns stuck arrogantly out from the head , and the eye-holes with their black silk pointed eyebrows were hideous in their suggestive emptiness . The whole figure was repulsive , almost loathesome , with its ugly mockery of death . It seemed so to Wiggins , and he guessed from the morbidly fasscinated eyes of Lucy and Cynthia that it seemed so to them , but Murphy 's powers of analytical observation were not marred by any flaw of sensitiveness . He got briskly to work . " Look him over , Dutreaux , " he ordered . Dutreaux got down on his knees and lifted one of the black-gloved hands . He rolled back the full sleeve and felt for a pulse . His fingers felt carefully about the high collar of the robe . He dropped his head to the chest and listened , then looked back at Murphy . " He 's dead , " he said . Murphy nodded agreement . Dutreaux felt around the mask . " Do n't touch that , " Murphy admonished . " We 'll wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss ? " he asked Lucy . " Help the little lady , Dutreaux . " As Lucy and Dutreaux went out he turned to Cynthia . " Coroner ought to be here in a minute , " he assured her . She nodded and did not reply . A draft from the open door blew the edge of her red robe to touch the edge of the red robe on the floor ; she snatched it back as though the body were that of a leper . Lucy brought her a chair , and she sat down mechanically . Murphy took the chair Dutreaux set for him , facing Cynthia across the mute accusation of the body . Dutreaux and Wade leaned against the gallery window . Murphy looked across the body to Cynthia . " You can help me if you will , Mrs. Fontenay , " he said . Cynthia wrenched her eyes from the dead man  | and looked at him . Her eyes were hazel , large and - limpid , and they seemed strangely dark under her golden hair . " I 'll do all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the first time she had spoken since they had left her bedroom . Her voice had an evenness that suggested not resignation nor resentment nor selfcontrol , but an odd combination of all three , as though Cynthia was not yet sure of her position but was confident that whatever it was she would be mistress of it . " Thank you , ma'am . " Murphy crossed his legs and leaned back as though to settle for a long conversation . " Now her 's what I wanted to ask you about , Mrs. Fontenay . This party you 're having  --  it 's the regular party , ai n't it , that you 're accustomed to give the night before Mardi Gras for the people that belong to Dis ? " Cynthia 's eyes narrowed ever so slightly . " Yes . " " And I gather , ma'am , that they 're all mighty careful not to be recognized ? " " Yes . " " Seems to me I 've heard somewhere that they 're so careful that everybody comes to the party in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And everybody , men and women alike , dresses just like everybody else ? Like you 're dressed now ? " " Yes . " " I see , ma'am . Now those people in there ? " he jerked a thumb toward the source of the jazz ? " what time do they unmask ? " " They do n't , " said Cynthia . Her frozen little monosyllables affected Murphy 's determined magnanimity as little as chips of ice thrown against a brick wall . Murphy gave her a smile that she might have thought amiable , but which Wiggins recognized as a threat of wrath to come .  | " Then there 's just one little point I 'd like to have cleared up , Mrs. Fontenay . If nobody could possibly know who anybody else was , how do you suppose the person who did the killing knew who to kill ? " A shiver ran through her whole slim body . Then she recovered herself and smiled back . It was a studied and eloquent smile . In the instance before she answered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation . You are here because it is your business to be here , and therefore I shall not be rude to you . But as to my private and personal thoughts upon this occasion , those I shall keep to myself . ' And so plainly did she convey this to Murphy , and to Lucy and Dutreaux and Wade and Wiggins , that it was like putting a needless epilogue to a speech when she said , " I 'm sure I do n't know , Captain Murphy . That 's what the police are for , is n't it ? " Murphy clasped his big hands around of one of his big knes and rocked himself gently to and fro . " Yes , ma'am , that 's what we 're for , and that 's one I of the things I guess we 'll have to find out . " He ceased rocking and reached into his breast-pocket for his notebook , pursuing his train of information with the steadiness of an expert following an old trade . " Now everybody in yonder is masked , ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Cynthia answered readily . " But she is not a member of Pis . Her name is Esther Morse . " Murphy wrote it down and put the book back into his pocket . There was an airy reasurrance of finality in the way he did it , a suggestion of ' We wo n't need to make notes on what 's coming . Not at all . It 's just between friends . ' He looked benignly at the ceiling . " Now , Mrs. Fontenay , before I go into the question of who you think might have wanted to kill Mr. Ghent , suppose you help me clear up this other question about everybody 's name being so secret . Seems  | to me if nobody knew anybody else , and everybody took such pains to keep his face hid , any guy that wanted could get himself a devil-dress and crash this party . How do you see about that ? " Cynthia smiled again . " We do n't usually like to make the plan of our organization public , Captvin Murphy , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She hesitated , as if uncertain as to how to satisfy Murphy and at the same time divulge the fewest possible secrets of Dis . Wiggins felt a little bit sorry for her . Wiggins was an amiable soul , and he had the newspaperman 's paradoxical quality of combining a genuine sympathy for people who got into trouble with a naive eagerness to put their trouble in the paper . This lady , now . She really did seem to be trying to be nice . But of course she 'd had a big shock , and of course she was n't used to talking across the body of a dead man , and of course she did n't know how to handle the cops . " It 's like this , " Cynthia explained after a moment . " Each member of Dis is given a seal ring at the time of his initiation . When we have a meeting , he is admitted on showing this ring and on giving a password . We have a different password for every meeting . Tonight it was Persephone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Persephone  --  queen of Hades . " " Yes , ma'am , " said Murphy , with more confidence , for he had surreptitiously glanced at Wade , who had indicated by a nod that he could both spell and remember Persephone ' for future reference . " But this is what I do n't see , ma'am , " continued Murphy . " There must be somebody who knows the names and addresses of all these people , or how do they get the passwords and things like that ? " " Oh , " said Cynthia . " I 'm sorry . I 'll explain . " IIer eyes fell suddenly on the dead man at her feet . She started and caught her hands together as though  | to stop a gesture of hysteria . But after an instant she spoke again , and her voice was low and rich as before . " Nobody has a list of members , " she explained . " I 'm the only member whom everybody knows , and I have never made any attempt to violate the anonymity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dis was begun seven years ago by  --  by Mr. Fontenay . Mr. Fontenay invited me to join  --  that was before we were married . I invited another member , and so on . So you see , each member knows only two others : the one who invited him and the one he invited . The membership is limited to fifty . " At every annual party at my house I pass around a tray containing fifty numbered slips of paper ; each guest draws a slip , and this number is the one by which he is identified at every Dis meeting during the ensuing year . I also give a password , which is used for a year . A member unable to attend any meeting notifies me in advance , signing his number ; if any member is unaccounted for at a meeting , his number is eliminated from the rolls . Announcement of this is made , and the person who invited him is told to get his ring and return it to me . Then the newest initiate , who is identified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is told he may invite a friend to join . When he invites a friend he sends me the friend 's measurements and I have the costume made . " We have regular meetings in the den where the floats for our Mardi Gras parades are built , and any message that must be given between-times is inserted in the personal columns of the newspapers . We have never had any trouble with gate-crashers  --  our tellers stand at the doors and check as the members come in . We know , you see , that there are fifty people to be accounted for , and we have the list of numbers being used each year . A gate-crasher would either use a  | number not on this year 's list or would duplicate the number belonging to a legitimate member , even if he had managed to find out the password and get a robe and mask and ring exactly like ours . If he used a number not on the list he would be denied admittance ; if he duplicated the number of someone already present they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ritual , and if we could not tell which was the gate-crasher that way , the accredited member would be given his choice of unmasking and being identified by the person who had invited him , or of resigning . But we have never had this happen . " Murphy ran a hand through the heavy white hair that crowned his disapproving face . The goings-on of some people , especially rich people , left Murphy puzzled , for Murphy knew very little about the state of boredom or the devices created to banish it . " And so , " he summarized , " everybody knows just two members . And they do n't even know those two members when they get all dressed up for a party . " Cynthia 's smile had become patient . " That 's the idea , captain . I ca n't promise that some members have n't recognized others or told others who they were . " Murphy nodded again . Cynthia 's answers had been given readily , too readily , thought Wiggins , who knew Murphy 's oft-voiced distrust of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police . But Murphy was evidently determined not to be outdone in politeness . He spoke with expansive geniality . " Now that 's a very nice clear account , Mrs. Fontenay . I think I understand just how it is . I hope what I 'm going to ask you wo n't be unduly embarrassing , because we know you 've had a big shock and all that , but I believe Mr. Fontenay ai n't living with you any more , and do n't he know some of the members of Dis ? " Cynthia sighed as if her patience was being sadly  | strained . " Mr. Fontenay has been living in Europe , captain , for about two years . " " I see , ma'am , thank you . " His eyes studied Cynthia narrowly across the body on the floor . He looked her up and down , from the shining disorder of her hair to the tip of the red satin slipper that showed under the hem of her robe . Then he asked , " Mrs. Fontenay , did you invite Arnold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He met Wade 's eyes , and the look was a mutual agrement that this was an episode to be watched . Wiggins glanced at Lucy , and saw that her eyes were fixed on Cynthia with something very like fear . " No , " she said quietly . " All right . " Murphy stood up . " Then maybe you can tell me , Mrs. Fontenay , how you are so sure that this murdered man ? " he pointed to the body on the floor ? " is Arnold Ramsey de Clifford Ghent . " For a moment Cynthia did not move . She simply sat there , very still , and suddenly every trace of expression sank out of her face and it became as vacant as the mask she had been wearing , as if she had withdrawn herself far away and was looking at Murphy from an infinite distance . Then she drew herself slowly to her feet . " Why ? " " Never mind any whys . ' Tell me how you know . Everybody came here masked . Everybody is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl ? " he pointed his thick forefinger from the body to Lucy ? " without taking off the mask or the gloves of this man , tell me Arnold Ghent has been murdered . " Cynthia was tense with anger . For an instant Wiggins thought she was about to break into a tirade of fury . Then she shook her head ever so slightly . Her hands clenched with bitter resolution . " Because he told me who he was  --  about two hours ago , " she answered briefly .  | Murphy wheeled on Lucy . " And you ? I suppose he told you too . You do n't belong to Pis , do you ? But you knew it was Arnold Ghent who was dead . " Lucy took a step forward . She looked straight into Murphy 's eyes , her hands defiantly on her hips . " You ca n't scare me like that again . I knew him because Mrs. Fontenay told me . Early this evening she said Mr. Ghent is number 47 . He does n't seem to be well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I came in he was lying on his side and I saw the number . That 's how I know . " Wiggins ' grin was an ovation . Murphy had turned again to face Cynthia . " Is that true ? " " Quite true . " Cynthia had regained her self-mastery . " If you will turn that body over you 'll see a number 47 on the back . Mr. Ghent did seem strange tonight . That 's why I told Lucy to take care of him . " Murphy shrugged increduously and slowly took out his black notebook . Wiggins , standing on tiptoe , saw Murphy 's pencil mark a big cross on a page headed Identity . ' There was a knock on the door . Dutreaux opened it . " It 's Doc Emerson , captain , " he said . " The coroner , " Wiggins whispered to Lucy . She glanced up with frank curiosity . " That Murphy gives me a big pain , " she whispered . " Sorry I kept you waiting , " the coroner was saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a ruddy face , dressed in a dinner-jacket that bore testimony to the party from which he had been summoned to attend to business . Wiggins noted with disgust that behind him came Kennedy of the Telegram and McFee of the Star , with a couple of photographers . He and Wade exchanged looks of resignation . " We have n't moved the body , doe , " Murphy was saying . " Good . I 'll be done in a minute . " Emerson opened his small black satchel and dropped to his knees . He made his measurements of the room and the position of the body and put a few routine questions to Lucy as to the body 's position when she found it . " %rant the mask ? " he asked , taking out a pair of surgeon 's scissors . " Sure , " nodded Murphy . " But do n't cut it unless you have to . The d. a. may need it . Cynthia turned away . She looked toward the door and back at the curious huddle of reporters and policemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not try to leave . Wiggins felt a new rush of sympathy for her . Funny , he thought , how what 's just business for some people is life and death for others . Emerson fumbled impatiently with the mask . His fingers found the hook and zipper that held it closed . There was a soft ripping sound as the hook slid over the metal catches . He took the ends in his hands and pulled carefully . There was a scream from Lucy and a muffled choking cry from Cynthia . Wade muttered a low " Hell . " Wiggins put out a hand to steady Lucy and looked at Murphy 's dazed expression and then at the dead face on the floor . " That 's not Arnold Ghent , " said Wiggins quickly . " You 're damn right it 's not , " said Wade . " It 's Roger Parnell . "  |  | C H A P T E R F O U R Wade put the telephone back on its stand and glanced over his shoulder toward the locked door of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sounds of voices and snatches of songs . So far it appeared that nobody but Cynthia and Lucy knew the police were in the house ; and it appeared also that nobody was likely to inquire till morning . He tiptoed back into the china-closet . Cynthia and Lucy were not there . Murphy and Emerson were leaning over Parnell 's body . They had loosened the red robe and unfastened the belt , and Emerson was looking at the body with a bewildered scowl . Wade went over to Wiggins , who was leaning against the window-sill watching the proceedings . " What 'd you do with the girls ? " he inquired . " Murphy sent ' em to Cynthia 's room . Told Cynthia she 'd feel better after she 'd had some rest . I guess he wanted a chance to talk things over kinds private , this guy being Parnell and all that . Coupla cops looking out for Cynthia . " Wade glanced at Emerson . " What 's on your mind , doctor ? " he asked , but as he spoke Emerson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he added half under his breath . " Here , Murphy , take a look at this . " Wade leaned over ; the reporters from the other papers came closer to watch . Emerson slipped down the shoulders of the robe and pointed . Protruding from the dead man 's shirt-front was the hilt of a pearlhandled knife  --  a knife that had not pierced through the red robe . " By all the saints , " Murphy exploded softly , " he was dead when they brought him here . " " Wait a minute , " said the coroner . He was on his knees examining the bloodstain on the red robe . " Get  | this right : the knife pierces the body in the cardiac region , probably through the heart . It has n't gone through the robe . The robe has n't a sign of a tear , and no opening either  --  it was fastened close up to the neck . With the robe fastened , the only indication of the knife was the little swell of the cloth over the hilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess you 're right , Murphy  --  he must have been dead when they brought him here . " " You mean they killed him first and dressed him afterwards ? " Wiggins asked incredulously . Disgusted disagreement was all over his stubby features . " That 's just one supposition , " said Emerson . He was still crouching by the body , the center of the ring of puzzled listeners . " You remember when we first saw the body , with the robe fastened , the only evidence of violence was the little splotch of blood on the robe  --  and of course the rise where the hilt of the knife was covered . " Murphy was paying close attention . " I think I get you , Emerson , " he assented . " The fellow that did this job figured if he could stab the man and dress him up in one of these outfits  --  maybe stab him some place else and bring him here  --  anybody who saw the body pitched over on its face the way it was would figure it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You 're right , " exclaimed Wiggins , grabbing Murphy by the arm to add emphasis to his next remark ? " and if it had n't been for that girl out there that you were just manhandling a minute ago , all the Irish cops in town would n't know anything had happened till yet . " " I guess that 's right , " Wade agreed . " Lucy 's noticing the bloodstain and discovering so soon that the man was dead does rather spoil the play , does n't it ? " " Yeah , " said Murphy , " if he was killed here . "  | " Huh , " Wiggins added grandly . " And if she 'd acted like some girls I know would have acted , busting in on that bunch of drunks screaming bloody murder , you 'd have had a riot and they 'd be all over town by now and nobody would ever know who was here tonight  --  and instead she just stepped out quietlike same as if finding bodies was all in the day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked up in one room . Me , I think you ought a give her a medal or something . " " As a matter of fact , " Wade said with a grin , " Wiggins is perfectly right . That 's probably what the murderer planned too  --  that when the body was found there 'd be a panic and the police would never know who 'd been here tonight , let alone who might have killed Parnell . " Wiggins scratched his head . " Then I guess , " he contributed , " all this makes it pretty clear that the murderer knew all about how this Dis business was run . He knew nobody knew who was here , and that once they made a run for it the cops could n't prove from now till doomsday that any of ' em had been near the place . Me , I think Lucy was pretty damn smart . " " Not to speak of Mrs. Fontenay , " added Kennedy of the Telegram . " Come to think of it , " said Wade suddenly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just along those lines . If she had given the alarm and they 'd all made a bolt , she would have been the only person we could interview . As it is , we 've got about fifty Possible murderers . " " Yeah , " said Murphy again , " if he was killed here . " Wade lifted the heel of one turned-up slipper . " Does n't look as if he were dragged . " " What about being carried ? " asked Murphy . " He 'd make a pretty big load , " Wade objected . " Must weigh a hundred and seventy-five pounds . "  | " At least , " agreed Emerson . Wade paused to think , and Kennedy asked , " About how long d' you think he 's been dead ? " " Hour  --  hour and a half  --  certainly not over two hours . " " Wait a minute , " said Wiggins . " Look at the back of his head , doe . See if there ai n't a bruise on it . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Parnell 's body . " Yes , right below the base of the skull  --  it 's more than a bruise  --  it 's an abrasion . Right up here toward the hairline . " " Smart boy , smart boy , " approved Wade out of the side of his mouth . " Wait , " went on Wiggins excitedly . " I 'm just trying to get the picture for you . He was knifed here ? " he pointed toward the enamel-topped table ? " and he fell back and hit his head here ? " he pointed to the table-edge . " He must 've been dead when he hit the floor . So he must 've been killed in this room . " " I think you 're right , " said the coroner after a moment . But I 'm puzzled to know-how he was stabbed from under the robe . " " Could n't they get the knife up through the sleeve ? " Wiggins asked . " Reach in ? Are the sleeves wide enough ? " Emerson tried it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what would this fellow be doing while they were sticking the knife up his sleeve and pulling it down ? " inquired Murphy . " Brushing his teeth ? There 's no signs of a struggle in here . " " No , " nodded Wiggins , " but there 's something else . Somebody shoved this stool after we came in . " He indicated a pantry stool . " It was over here . Now look . " He placed the stool back in front of the cupboard . " You see , you step on the stool , then on this cabinet counter here , then up here . " He illustrated by hopping up . " Now suppose this guy was up on the cabinet ledge , looking for something , and sup-  | pose the murderer was standing on the floor . He coulda slipped the knife up under the robe and drove it in just when this lad stepped down . " The coroner considered , then asked suddenly , " What about the belt ? " " Well , you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I forgot the belt . " Murphy turned to Wade . " What do you see in it ? " he asked . Wade shook his head . " Not much . All I can see is , he was killed here and banged his head on the table , or he was killed some place else and planted here . Either he was dressed for the Dis ball when he was killed or he was dressed for the ball later . One guess is as good as another . " He pulled out a cigarette , tapping it on the face of his wrist-watch , and slowly touched a match to it . " I know that does n't seem to make sense , Murphy , but here 's what you 're up against . Mrs. Fontenay and Lucy saw him alive ? or at least they saw someone wearing this costume alive  --  that means he was here in full regalia . Now they thought it was Ghent . Remember , it might have been Ghent , and he might have killed Parnell , who was hidden back here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parnell up in this stuff and left in plain street clothes . " " You 're all wet , " Wiggins insisted . " This guy must have been here in costume and he must have been killed here . " " Why ? " asked Murphy . " Because , " said Wiggins , looking up confidently , " if he was carried in any position but flat the blood would have streaked down . That 's why . " Dr. Emerson looked up . " That 's right , Wiggins . " He pointed to the shirt-front . The bloodstain around the knife was almost a neat circle . He considered a moment . " Did n't you tell me , Wiggins , that when you took the pictures Mrs. Fontenay told you there were forty-nine Dis members present and one guest ? " Wiggins nodded . " Well , Murphy said she told him there were just fifty members of the organization , so that 's all but one accounted for . " " Wonder who the absent guy is ? " Wiggins murmured . " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll find him , " the coroner promised . " Meanwhile , get this . As Wiggins says , if Parnell had been stabbed somewhere else and brought in , the blood would have trickled down and there would be a point to this circle . And if he had been thrown over a man 's shoulder and brought in here the knife would not be upright  --  I mean by that , if the knife had been pressed upon by the carrier 's shoulder you would see some post-mortem evidence around the edges of the wound . Wiggins is right . He must have been killed here . " " All right , " acquiesced Murphy , impatient to be at his work . " You can take charge of the body , coroner . " The coroner carefully extracted the knife from the wound . It was a sharply-edged stiletto with an eightinch blade that tapered down to a fine point . The handle was mother-of-pearl . Murphy inspected it carefully . The fine steel of the blade was bright where it showed through the blood . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded a handkerchief over it and handed it to the coroner . " You 'll give it to the Bertillon men for us , will you ? I believe mother-of-pearl do n't show fingerprints , but tell them to be careful , and to look for a trademark . " He turned to the reporters . " All right , fellows , clear the room now . I 'll take Wade as representing all of you while I have a talk with Mrs. Fontenay and that girl again . I do n't want too many of you around and he 'll give you anything he gets . That all right with you fellows ? " " Suits me , " said Kennedy with a grin at Wade , " but no fenaglin ' . "  |  | Wade grinned back . " No more than the law allows , " he said . " All right , boys , " concluded Murphy . " You wait here and we 'll be back in a minute . " " Okay , " put in Wiggins . " Let 's go . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started , but Wiggins interrupted . " Listen , you . We photographers got to have a representative too , do n't we , fellows ? " " Sure , " agreed the chunky round-faced boy from the Star . " If we do n't that guy Murphy 'll never get on a plate of mine again . " " Mine neither , " chimed in the Telegram photographer , putting down his camera . " Besides , if it had n't been for a photographer you apes would have been looking all over to find out where this guy was killed . " He winked significantly , and then , in an undertone that could be heard all over the room he added , " That ought to hold him . " But Murphy had already barged out into the hall with Dutreaux . Wade followed him , and Wiggins , carrying the whispered injunction of his colleagues to " show that red-necked camera-louse where to head in , " was already on his way .  | C H A P T E R F I V E Characteristically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but grabbed the knob and walked smartly into the scented lavender privacy of her bedroom . Cynthia had curled herself up on the bed , two lavender satin pillows behind her shoulders ; she held a cigarette between the fingers of one hand and with the other she was idly turning the pages of a fashion magazine . An empty highball glass stood on the bedside table . She barely glanced up as they entered , and dropped her eyes again to the contemplation of the page , but Lucy , who had been clearing up some of the more intimate details here and there , stopped short , a flask of perfume in her hand and a bit of blue crepe lingerie over her arm . The two policemen Murphy had sent in , who had been laboring to make themselves at ease in a pair of spindle-legged chairs near the door , jumped gratefully to their feet . Lucy glanced uneasily from Murphy to Cynthia , then hurriedly thrust the stepins into a drawer as Murphy strode over to where Cynthia was reclining . " You can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two policemen by the door . Cynthia laid down her magazine , tapped the end of her cigarette and raised her limpid eyes to his as he halted by the side of the bed . " You wanted to speak to me , captain ? " Murphy thrust his fists into his jacket pockets and regarded her with resolution . Murphy was not brutal , but his twenty years on the force had taught him that a cop on the Homicide Squad usually chalks up a defeat for every softening of his program of ruthlessness . " Now , Mrs. Fontenay , " he announced , " we know where we are at . "  | She frowned questioningly . Murphy continued . " Roger Parnell was killed in this house less than two hours ago . He was alive in this house . You saw him here . I want to know how you got him mixed up with Arnold Ghent . I want to know if Ghent 's number is 47 . I want to know what Parnell 's number was . And I want to know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's suit on . " Cynthia moistened her lips . " Roger Parnell never was a member of Dis to my knowledge , " she answered , slowly and clearly . Wiggins caught himself in the middle of an odd emotion  --  wondering how much she was covering up , and determining to find out , and at the same time admiring the courage with which she was facing them . She was quite steady as she went on . " How Mr. Parnell got a costume and a ring , and who gave him the password , I ca n't tell you . And I do n't know now whether or not Mr. Ghent is here tonight . " Murphy turned to speak over his shoulder . " Dutreaux , get to the phone and ring Arnold Ghent 's apartment . Do n't tell him anything , but if he 's at home ring headquarters and have them send a man to bring him here . Got that ? Now , Mrs. Fontenay , if Ghent 's a good friend of yours seems like you 'd have known him well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a false face on . " " You were n't engaged to him , were you ? " Wiggins interpolated . " Certainly not , " she retorted crisply . " But you are gonta marry somebody , ai n't you ? " Wiggins insisted . Cynthia 's great hazel eyes turned to rest on his small figure . The corners of her mouth twitched in the ghost of a smile . " Frankly , Mr. Wiggins , " she returned , " I do n't think that 's any of your business . " " Well , ma'am , " insisted Murphy , who had no pa-  | tience with people who strayed from the point at issue , " what made you think Mr. Parnell was Mr. Ghent ? " " The man with the 47 on his back told me he was Mr. Ghent , Captain Murphy . I told you the man I thought was Mr. Ghent , had been behaving strangely tonight . He seemed to be making pointed efforts to avoid me . His attitude was so unusual that I thought he could n't he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she told you . " Lucy nodded valiantly . " And Mr. Ghent and Mr. Parnell are about the same size , " she added . " Yes , " said Cynthia readily , " they are both six feet one . " " Huh , " grunted Murphy . " You 're mighty sure . I guess you knew Parnell pretty well then , even though he did n't belong to your lodge ? " 1,1 Cynthia started . A slow dull red crept up from Ill her throat and over her cheeks . For a moment she did not answer , and when she did her voice was uneven , as if every word came with a separate effort . " I knew him  --  rather well . But he  --  has been in this house  --  to my knowledge  --  only once or twice ? before tonight . " " Ghent 's phone do n't answer , captain , " reported Dutreaux from the other side of the room . " No ? Well , I guess we 'll have to find him . " Murphy returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather well , eh ? Tell us about it . " The instant 's interruption had given her time to recover her poise . " We were in college together , " she said evenly . " Oh , in college , eh ? Where was that ? " " Chicago . " " Chicago , eh ? " Murphy 's ruddy face expressed simple exasperation . Wiggins leaned against the wall and scowled thoughtfully . He was beginning to see that Murphy was dealing with a lady of audacious  | though variable temperament , and that it would take a finer instrument than Murphy possessed to pry out her secrets . Wiggins was not versed in linguistic subtleties , and he would have been hard put to it to frame the sort of questions he thought Murphy ought to ask , but he had a feeling that somebody ought to get busy and pull the facts out of Mrs. Fontenay . He glanced at Lucy . She stood with one hand on the foot of Cynthia 's bed , like a small defiant bodyguard , watching the effect of Cynthia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Murphy eloquently. " 17h-huh . " He rocked back and forth on his heels . " When 's the last time you saw Parnell before tonight ? " Cynthia 's eyebrows , plucked into two thin arches , drew together in a polite little frown . " Let me see . Several days ago . I went into the Palm Gardens restaurant , and he was lunching there . " " Did you lunch with him ? " " No . " " Was he alone ? " " No . He was with a friend . " " With who ? " " A friend  --  Mr. Valdon . " " Oh  --  I get you . Fritz Valdon ? " " Yes . " Murphy rocked on his heels , his slow nod suggesting vast comprehension . Cynthia regarded him with poisonous sweetness . " Did you speak to Parnell ? " he demanded . " Briefly . " " What did you say ? " Cynthia 's demureness was almost absurd . " I said , Good afternoon , Roger . How do you do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Every word , captain . " " Humph. "  | Wiggins looked at Wade , and saw that Wade like himself was far from satisfied with Murphy 's questionings . Wiggins was puzzled . There ought to be another factor in this inquiry  --  he was not sure what was lacking , but he was sure that so far Cynthia had all the laurels . " So you did n't speak to them long , eh ? " Murphy 's cold blue eyes were drilling at Cynthia 's . But it was like diamond meeting diamond . " Now , Mrs. Fontenay , you see I do n't know much about you , and this affair makes it necessary that I ask you some personal questions . Do you mind ? " Cynthia smoothed a fold of her voluminous red robe and looked up with an air of resigned exasperation . " My dear Captain Murphy , " she answered sweetly , " I would n't mind anything if I could just have a drink . " Murphy 's flushed face creased into a half-smile . " That you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you can get it . " As long as there was no sign of rebellion , Murphy was quite willing to keep a witness in good humor . Lucy was already opening a scrolled rosewood eellarette that stood in a corner near the dressing-table . She brought out a decanter and several glasses , and offered the tray to the captain . " No thanks , " he said , rather brusquely . " We do n't need any . " " Oh , speak for yourself , Murphy . " Wiggins reached out to detain Lucy . " I need lots of it . " " Mr. Wade ? " asked Lucy . Wade gave the captain a sidelong smile and accepted . As they nodded to Cynthia and lifted their glasses they could see that she had filled her own nearly to the brim . She drained it and took another . Then she reached for a fresh cigarette . " All right , captain , " she said smiling . " I 'm a forti-  | fled woman . Do your worst . " Her smile was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to start on the assumption that you want to help me , ma'am , " he said to her . " And I 'm going to start off with the most important question . Who do you think killed Parnell ? " Cynthia took a deep draw from her cigarette . She looked down as she blew out the smoke , as if she was pondering his question . " I do n't want to seem trite , captain , " she said after a pause , " and I do n't want you to misunderstand me . I know before this case is over there will be lots of grief in it for everybody concerned , myself included . " She paused to pour another drink . " This is my house ; you say you are certain Roger Parnell was killed here . Those people in the other room are as much a mystery to me as they are to you . I do n't know who five of them are . I ca n't possibly say , then , who killed Mr. Parnell  --  but I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are only two dangerous things that Roger Parnell ever played with . " Murphy nodded . " Yes . Two things ? " Cynthia finished her drink and set down the glass . " Two things , Captain Murphy , either one of which might have led to his death . Perhaps I should n't tell you this , but I 'll gamble it 's true  --  that behind the murder of Roger Parnell you 'll find one of these two . Maybe both . " " What are they ? " Cynthia smiled . " Two very old man-baiters , captain . Women , and money . " Murphy was interested but not convinced . " That fits almost every murder that 's ever been committed , Mrs. Fontenay . What makes you think it 's unusual in this case ? " " You asked me what I thought . " Cynthia shrugged . " I 'm simply telling you what 's been told me. "  | " Sure , I understand that . " Murphy stood looking down at her , as she half reclined against her cushions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a fashion that suggested serene detachment from the affairs of Roger Parnell and wonder at Murphy 's importance . Wade would have called it tantalizing ; Wiggins mentally termed it " giving Murphy the full works . " But Murphy was determined . " What I want to know , " he insisted , " is some of the things about Parnell that people are n't talking about . What people do n't like him ? Who might want him out of the way ? What do you know about his ambitions ? Whose toes has he stepped on ? That 's what I want from you . " Cynthia 's expression changed  --  subtly , but definitely . It was plain that she disliked this switch away from the generalities she had advanced . " I 'm sorry , Captain Murphy , " she said clearly , " but I know very little about Roger Parnell 's personal affairs . I have already told you our acquaintance was casual . " " Listen , sister . " Murphy had suddenly begun to thunder . " Quit this damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You knew him pretty well . Now I want to know what you know about him . And I ai n't staying here all night . " Cynthia sat up straight . " Do n't be absurd . " She slipped off the bed and stood up , facing him across it . " I wo n't be talked to like that by you or by anyone else . Please leave my room . All of you . At once . Get out . " " Sit down , " barked Murphy , " and shut up . " Their eyes met . Cynthia 's were dark with anger ; Murphy 's showed a curious mixture of menace and hopelessness . " You listen to me , Mrs. Fontenay , " he threw at her , in a voice that had become low and threatening .  | " I do n't want any foolishness . You 've got the right not to say anything if saying it is going to incriminate you . Because whatever you say is going to be used against you if you 're charged . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Wade smothered a smile ; Wiggins wanted to chuckle . Murphy was observing the letter of the regulations with practised skill . They both knew that his tactics meant he thought he was on a trial worth pursuing . " ? but if you do n't tell me now the things I know you can tell me I 'll make it plenty rough even if you are a lady . Who hated Roger Parnell ? Why ? " " I do n't know , " said Cynthia. " 0 yes you do , sister . Who hated him ? " They could see her wavering between rebellion and acquiescence . " I tell you , " she parried , " I do n't know . " " Listen , " said Murphy . " Maybe you do n't understand that I mean business . What do you know about Roger Parnell ? " " I do n't know anything about him , but ? " " But what ? " " But  --  why do you make me say this ? " " Come on . Who hated him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people hated him ? I suppose . " " Who were they ? Who do you know ? Quick now . WTho ? " " Please ? ! " she exclaimed . " I do n't know  --  but if there 's anyone who does  --  there 's a girl ? " Murphy 's face betrayed surprise . He leaned closer . " Take your choice , " he said . " Tell me or take the consequences . She wo n't know you said it . Who is she ? " Cynthia 's gesture across the bed toward him gave a tinge of melodrama to her surrender . " Esther Morse . She 's in there . With a white dress on . Now leave me alone . "  | " Esther Morse . What does she know about him ? " Cynthia sighed . " Do you remember last year a boy named Dick Barron nearly went to jail for stealing his employers ' money to pay his gambling debts ? " " Sure . What 's that got to do with Esther Morse and Parnell ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People say ? anyway , his father paid back the money and kept him out of jail , and then died . The papers said heart failure . You remember . Esther Morse was engaged to Dick . After she broke the engagement she became very intimate with Roger Parnell . They say ? You ask her . " She stopped . " Now let me alone , will you ? " Cynthia sat down on the edge of the bed opposite him . She poured a drink . Murphy 's jaw set . " Now answer some more . Where 's your husband ? " Cynthia turned her glass up before she answered . She smiled . " Paris , or somewhere on the continent . If you mean Mr. Fontenay , but he 's not my husband . " " Divorced ? " She nodded smiling . " Thoroughly . " Murphy grunted . " You 'd been married before , had n't you ? " " Yes . " " Where is he ? " " Washington , the last I heard of him . IIe 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Divorced from him too ? " " Yes . " " His name ? " Murphy demanded . " Davenport  --  August Davenport . " Murphy put it in the notebook . " Any others ? " Cynthia reached for the flask of perfume Lucy had set on the bedside table when Murphy entered , and  | held it delicately to her nostrils . " That , " she answered , " is my entire case history . There were no others . " Wiggins ' head bobbed up abruptly . He looked at Lucy . She had turned away and was emptying an ash-tray into the wastebasket . Wiggins scowled . He remembered that when he and Lucy had sat in the courtyard discussing Cynthia 's next bridegroom and he had held up three fingers , Lucy had shaken her head and held up four . Wiggins puckered his lips and studied his shoe-laces . Murphy had closed his notebook and was replacing it in his breast pocket . " Let 's look over the rest of them . You 'd better come with us , sister . " Cynthia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sake stop calling me sister ! " Lucy , still avoiding Wiggins ' searching eyes , opened the door . Cynthia went out and Murphy followed with Wade and Dutreaux . Wiggins hung back , and stopped where Lucy stood by the door . He held up three fingers . " How come ? " he asked . Lucy blushed . She looked down . " Gee , Tony , " she said finally , " I always was dumb at adding things up . "  | CHAPTER SIX " Nothing like it since the battle of the Marne , " Wade exclaimed joyfully into the telephone . " Murphy calls for a riot squad and they pile down in about twelve police cars . There 's a cop at every twist in the place and fifty red devils and one little girl in white all lined up for them to work on . Dr. Emerson took Parnell 's body to the morgue . " He listened for a second or two . It 's going to be worth holding up the city edition . Murphy swears he 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused again . " Now look , Koppel . Send down one of your bright young men to stand by for pictures . We 'll send the plates in as soon as he gets here . Charlie can get the pictures out for you . Wiggins says send some more flash lamps . He 's all set to break the world 's mug-making record tonight . This place is a madhouse  --  I ' 11 give you a new lead in a half hour . So long . " Wade replaced the telephone on its stand and lit a cigarette . His lean face creased with a slow placid smile . Everything was jake so far . This was a big story and Koppel knew it . Wade lounged happily down the hall . His placid smile still illumined his countenance as he greeted the policeman on guard at the door of the ballroom . " What say , hots ? " " Okay , pops . Go on in . The old man is going to make a speech . " " Would n't miss it for a farm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of terrified confusion . The jazz had given place to scared voices and the dancing to jerky little movements of protest ; the red  | devils were huddled into groups , talking and gesticulating incoherently . At every door there was a policeman , and in front of every policeman was a group praying , demanding , offering bribes to be let out . Murphy stood on the steps leading up to the throne , and flanking him was a cluster of reporters and headquarters men . Over in corners the photographers were adjusting their cameras and chattering in pleased whispers . Wiggins peered around a clamorous masker and gave Wade a cheerful grimace that told him plainly , " This is what I was born for . " Lucy was not in sight . As Wade entered Cynthia Fontenay detached herself from a frantic red group and came toward Murphy . Her face under her bright golden hair was strangely composed ; there were shadows under her eyes and a hard little line at each corner of her mouth that looked as if it might have been put there with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  her whole manner suggested simply tiredness and exasperation . She stood quietly at Murphy 's elbow , watching as two policemen came in . They carried between them a small Chinese-red table , which Murphy indicated that he wanted in the center of the room . He advanced a step . The clatter of voices slowed , hesitated and under Murphy 's pitiless glare died down . " It pains me to tell you , " boomed Murphy , his syllables rumbling in the corners of the room like thunder , " that Roger Parnell was murdered in this house within the last two hours and that you are all detained for questioning . " There was a muffled shriek as Murphy paused to let his announcement sink in . The devils buzzed impotently and huddled closer together . Murphy looked around with lordly assurance and caught sight of Wade . He beckoned . " You can tell the rest of the boys , " he said in a low voice as Wade reached his side , " that this murder  | is going to be investigated here and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Wade chuckled . " I 'll tell them . Looks as if we 'll be here all night . " Murphy 's right fist smacked the palm of his left hand . " I do n't give a damn if we 're here till Easter morning , " he retorted . " Mrs. Fontenay has been blathering about how impossible it is to shatter all the regulations of Dis . What the hell ? " Wade glanced involuntarily at Cynthia . She was sitting on the steps of the throne , her hands laced lightly around her knees , her hazel eyes lifted to Murphy 's back with enigmatic calmness . Her lips had curved gently into a smile , a slow , baffling smile , as if it hid a secret triumph . Wade looked back at Murphy . " Good boy , " he applauded in an undertone . " But for God 's sake do it in time for us to get it in the paper . " " Very well ? " Murphy made the announcement to the room in general in answer to Wade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . " There was a wild cacophony of protest . Cynthia stood up and came toward him , and her husky voice cut clearly across the confused babble in the room . " Captain Murphy , " she said , " I 'm sure if I explain to you that for an hour before Mr. Parnell 's body was found , no one but the four members of the Dis Council and the tellers left this room , you will not embarrass my guests . " Murphy shook his head . He surveyed Cynthia with his blank " **25;57;TOOLONG " appraisal . " Sorry , sister , but this is just my job . " he raised his voice . " I 'll have to have the name , and I mean the real name , of everybody who was in this house at the time of the murder . " A masked figure , betrayed as masculine by its height and walk , came over to them . " I do n't think you 've given this careful considera. - Murphy ran his hand over his bush of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masked man answered evenly . " I do n't know their names . Mrs. Fontenay has their Dis numbers . " Cynthia had reached into an inside pocket of her robe . She held out a slip of paper . Murphy glanced at the numbers listed on it . " Bring them up here , " he ordered . Cynthia walked away . Wade saw her moving from one group to another with a poise that amazed him ; he was beginning to wonder at such rigidity of temperament , and then suddenly he surmised that it was not rigidity . It was simply callousness . Cynthia 's whole life had been a series of dramatic climaxes , till now she was so bored that a houseful of policemen presented simply another nuisance to be dealt with as speedily as possible . Wade caught himself making a grimace of puzzled distaste , then he recalled himself to the business in hand as he heard Murphy address the masked man . " Well , mister , and you ? If you 're so anxious not to have all these folks bothered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us have a look at you . You were one of them that got out , I think you said ? " " Yes  --  I was . " The masked man hesitated , then , as though yielding as readily as he could to the inevitable , he raised a hand and unfastened the mask . " I 'm Dick Barron , " he said to Murphy . With the mask off , his voice was deep and pleasant . Murphy looked him over with complacent recognition . Wade studied him too , but with more thoughtful attention than Murphy  --  the tight stubborn lips ,  | tion , Captain Murphy , " he said . His voice was muffled by his mask , but the words were plain . " What Mrs. Fontenay said is true . We had our own tellerssergeants-at-arms , if you will  --  lock the doors , and only four of us left . I was one of them . The others could not possibly have gotten out . "  | the eyes that habitually narrowed as though they had learned to look suspiciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sensitive nostrils . It was an odd , contradictory face a face crossed with conflicting characters like a palimpsest . Wade found himself involuntarily recalling Dick Barron 's narrow escape last year from a sentence for theft  --  an escape made possible by the relinquishing of virtually all the family property  --  and his father 's death , which the coroner out of consideration for his family had agreed to call heart failure . He met Dick Barron 's scornful dark eyes with the impersonal pleasantness that ten years of newspaper contacts had taught him . " I 'm glad to know you , Barron  --  I 've heard of you . I 'm Wade of the Creole . " Dick did not seem to be much interested . " I 've heard of you too . I suppose I 'll hear more of you before I get out of this  --  yes ? " Then suddenly , before Wade could answer , he had turned away and was standing with his back to them ; and at the same time that Wade saw his movement he saw the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Please , " she said , " are you Captain Murphy ? " Her voice was low and childish ; her dark eyes , as they lifted to meet Murphy 's , were appealing in their simple bewilderment and fear . Murphy turned to her with an unpremeditated smile . " Sure I 'm Captain Murphy , miss . What can I do for you ? " Esther pushed back her flowing dark hair , and her hands twisted together in helpless fright . " Wo n't you let me go home ? " she exclaimed . " Wo n't you please ? I 'm Esther Morse . I do n't belong to Dis  --  I do n't know why on earth I ever came here tonight ? I do n't know who any of these people are  --  wo n't you let me go home ? " Murphy 's ruddy face had resumed its grimness . He  | shook his head . " Ca n't do that , miss . Ca n't let anybody leave . " She smothered a little helpless cry . " But I 'm so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said you wanted to see everybody who left the room while the initiation was going on  --  I thought perhaps you were going to let us go home ? " There was a muffled inarticulate sound from the man whose back was turned . Esther raised her head to look at him , and she drew back with amazed recognition as he slowly turned around . " Dick ! " she exclaimed , and then for an instant neither of them spoke ; they simply stood staring at each other , and the look between them was so intense and so utterly self-forgetful that Wade felt as if he was shamefully spying . Then Dick Barron spoke to her , in a manner that tried to be matter-of-fact and was not . " I 'll look out for you , Esther . " His voice recalled her . As though she had suddenly remembered that she stood in a room full of people , she swept back her hair with a little self-conscious movement and took a step away from him . " Thank you , but I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be all right , " said Murphy hastily , and as Dick gave a hopeless shrug Esther moved further away from him toward the throne . Murphy turned his attention to the masked devils marshaled up to him by Cynthia . " These are the ones that left the room , ma'am ? I see . Matson ! ? take all these people in the other room . Get the maid , and I 'll be right in . You go too , Miss Morse . " Esther obediently went out with the others . One man in the group waited by Murphy 's side . Wade saw the number 31 on his back . " I want to see you privately before you start , " Wade heard him say . Murphy grunted an impatient assent . The members of the Dis Council filed out . Murphy  | glared suspiciously at the policeman on guard at the door . " That door closed ? " " Sure , sir . " " Right . Connelly ! That door by you closed ? And all the windows ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murphy resumed his embattled posture and looked over the remaining members of Dis , who stood uncertainly in front of him , whispering and edging out of range of the photographers . " Now look here , you " he announced . " There seems to be a little bit of misunderstanding about what I want , so I 'm going to tell you again . I want your names and addresses . I know you think I 'm unreasonable , but this is murder . You get me ? A man has been killed . Killed here . Get that , now ? Murder . It 's a serious thing . " Murphy paused . " And so , " he resumed , ignoring the exclamations of protest that popped like little rockets around him , " I 'm going to have to use serious methods . Get that ? Serious methods . And so all of you will please go peacefully with the officers and do like they tell you . Until your names are given and verified you 're all under technical arrest . " The protests became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he would have paid to a dripping faucet . He beckoned to a sergeant . " Take them to the Third Precinct , Harry , and check up on the names . Keep them there till you hear from me . No paroles unless in the custody of a lawyer with affidavits on identification . Let ' em use the phones and make ' em comfortable . " He shrugged toward Wade . " And that , my boy , is that . " Wiggins and two other photographers were elbowing their way through the furious throng of Dis . " What 's up ? " Wiggins chirruped to Wade . " Booked at the Third . " " Suits me . " Wiggins was out of the door , camera ,  | tripod and flash . Wade grinned . He could write the caption for the picture without seeing it . " From Dis to Dismay . " " Party Ends in Jail . " The room was wild with protesting confusion . Several persons sat on the floor , refusing to be moved . Others rushed up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. de la ? " " Captain , this will ruin ? " " I 'm a friend of ? " " Please , captain , my wife will ? " Murphy was unrelenting . " Tell it to the clerk at the Third . Boys , see if you ca n't carry those ladies and gentlemen that seem unable to walk . " He turned to the reporters , his hands spread out . " What else can I do ? " he asked . " We got to know who 's here . " They nodded with enthusiasm . The morning paper men hurried off . Wade saw McFee of the Star beat him to the phone on the hall table . Then he caught sight of Lucy , who was chattering brightly with one of the detectives . Wade beckoned to her . " Any other phones ? " She nodded comprehendingly . " One in Mrs. Fontenay 's bedroom  --  but you 'd better not use that ; one in the kitchen downstairs , for marketing . " Wade smiled his thanks . " Keep it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm with Wiggins on this story . " Lucy returned his smile . " So am I , Mr. Wade . " In the courtyard Wade saw Wiggins and his confreres joyously attending to their jobs . Every time a flash bulb glowed somebody screamed . Every time somebody screamed another flash bulb glowed . Wade found the kitchen door and lit a match . The phone was on a shelf . He took it down and called Koppel . When he walked back into the courtyard it was cleared of maskers , and Murphy was standing by the fountain smoking a cigar . He was alone . " I 've been waiting for you , my lad , " Murphy said  | glumly . " Who do you think is upstairs dressed up in one of them suits ? " Wade laughed . " You tell me . Peggy Joyce ? " " No . Listen , this is serious . " Murphy eyed him severely . " Fritz Valdon . " " You mean it ? " Wade had lost his languor . " Valdon ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Murphy . " He says unless I let him take a sneak ther 'll be big trouble , and I 'll be in the middle of it . " Wade peered at Murphys ominous face through the dark . He and Murphy had been friends for a long time , and Wade knew that Valdon was a powerful politician in or out of office . Right now he happened to be out , but Wade knew that his devious alliances still made him a dangerous man to antagonize . " Well ? ? " he asked at length . " I told him a reporter had already recognized him and had sent his name to his paper . His number 's 31 . Will you go through for me ? " " Oh , sure , " nodded Wade . " Go on back . The Creole and Valdon never have been friends . I 'll make your story stand up when I see him . " Murphy patted his shoulder . " You 're a good boy , Wade . That damn ? " The rest of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he climbed the stairs . Wade waited a minute or two and followed . The members of the Council were gathered in the dining room , all of them , except Cynthia and Esther , still masked . They were seated , waiting in angry resignation , while Murphy scratched something on his pad . Kennedy and McFee , in a corner , were talk- things over in low tones . Wade caught sight of a black 31 on one of the red suits . He walked over to the man who wore it and bent over his chair . " Anything you 'd like to say about this , Valdon ? " he asked . " I 'm Wade of the Creole . "  | " No  --  not a thing . " The voice from under the mask was muffled and flat . " How did you know me ? " Wade laughed softly . " Never forget an old friend , Valdon . I knew you in there the minute you spoke . " Number 31 got up and moved further away from the others . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Smart , are n't you ? " " Just so-so . " There was a moment 's silence . " Smart enough to use ten grand ? " " Meaning ? " " First  --  how did you recognize me inside ? " " When you were talking you kept rubbing your thumb like this . " Wade illustrated by rubbing his own thumb across the third joint of his forefinger . It was , he remembered , one of Valdon 's characteristic gestures . " Rubbed my thumb , did I ? Well , can you rub out that recollection with ten grand ? That 's what I mean . " " Oh , I see . " Wade nodded thoughtfully . The other man 's voice dropped . " That 's only one kind of a rub  --  forgetting things . " Wade returned whisper for whisper . " Nuts , Valdon . Just because you bullied Parnell , do n't get a swelled head . Anyway , you 're too late . The office has your name . " He prevaricated glibly . His companion shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We might have done business . And do n't misunderstand me . I meant if you would n't take money you might do it , say  --  for friendship 's sake . I 'm a  --  good friend to have . " Wade smiled . " I do n't misunderstand , Valdon . I just saw a friend of yours go to the morgue for an autopsy . " He turned to walk away . A gloved hand on his arm detained him . " No . Do n't go off on the wrong track , Wade . I did n't kill Parnell . "  | Wade drew his arm away . " That 's your story . Let 's make it unanimous . I did n't either . " There was a low laugh , a cocky , arrogant laugh that crystallized Wade 's dislike for the man behind the mask . " Figure me for anything but a sap , Wade , " he said calmly . " If I had known Parnell was here I should n't have been here myself . If I 'd known Parnell was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had wanted him out of the way  --  that way  --  he 'd be out . " Wade studied the slant-eyed mask with cool interest . " And on top of that , " the calm voice went on , " you should know me better than this . If I had killed Parnell I would n't call attention to the fact by offering chumps like you and Murphy a big score like ten grand to lam . " Wade smiled admiringly . " Keep it up , Fritz . You 've got a good case . " The other man reached back and loosened the catch on his mask . The zipper slid up and he pulled at the edges . Still muffled , his voice came through . " And this clinches it , " Wade heard . The mask fell . Wade started . The man he had spoken to was not Fritz Valdon . " It 's a peculiar thing , Mr. Wade , " the man said , " how you newspapermen remember things you 've never seen . " He rubbed his thumb and forefinger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be seeing you again . My name , Mr. Wade , is Conroy ? Con Conroy . A great many people say I 'm Mr. Valdon 's secretary . "  | C H A P T E R S E V E N Con Conroy leaned idly against the wall , his eyes traveling with languid attention over the indignant confusion of the other members of the Dis Council , who were whispering and protesting and putting off as long as possible the inevitable moment of unmasking . Wade , his hands plunged into his pockets , studied Conroy while interest began to displace his angry astonishment . In the instant that he had seen Conroy 's face he had realized that his own foolish position would provoke mirth from Fritz Valdon 's friends when it was recounted , but in that same instant he was intrigued by the cool impudence of Conroy 's tactics . Conroy pushed back his horned headdress and stood smilingly attentive . He appeared to be about thirty , and looked , Wade thought , like an overgrown cherub ; his face was round and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all things , by a dimple ; his eyes were the mild china-blue that one is accustomed to associate with innocence , and his fawn-colored hair fluffed over his head like a baby 's . For an instant neither he nor Wade spoke ; Conroy stood calmly twirling his mask , his manner plainly indicating that the next move was not up to him , while Wade 's hands , clenched in impotent wrath in his pockets , gradually relaxed , and then Wade said , " All right , Conroy . I do n't say I 'm delighted to make your acquaintance , but at least it 's advanced my education . Since when ? " He was interrupted by the approach of Murphy , who came up red-faced and thick-voiced , to demand " Who the hell are you anyway ? " " Why , captain ! " Conroy 's reply was offered with elaborate suavity . " Just a working man enjoying his night off . "  | Murphy 's thick fists rested on his hips . " What the hell do you mean by saying you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The blonde eyebrows of Mr. Conroy lifted . " I thought it might get me outside , " he answered mildly . Murphy glared . Wade heard a chuckle in the neighborhood of his elbow and glanced down to behold Wiggins , who was observing the altercation from the rear . As he met Wade 's eyes Wiggins gave his head an expressive movement to indicate the space behind Murphy , where Wade saw the others , absorbed by this new promise of adventure , coming nearer to listen to the dialogue . Kennedy of the Telegram had edged in at Murphy 's elbow . " What 's all this about ? " he inquired with interest . " This chiseler , " foghorned Murphy , " told me he was Valdon  --  said he wanted to make a sneak . He tried to high-pressure me , that 's all . " Murphy 's violent contempt had not , however , the slightest effect on the equanimity of Mr. Con Conroy , who was playing with a cigarette he had produced from the voluminous folds of his red robe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cigarette met the flame and Conroy 's meek blue eyes studied Murphy calmly through a veil of smoke . " That 's his story , " said Conroy . " What happened was that I told this copper Valdon was here and would appreciate a private quizzing ; just a request for ordinary official courtesy . And then , " he continued gently , but with the ironic smile of the man who presents a sure case , " the said copper did address me as the aforementioned Valdon and did inform me tenderly and with apology that I had already been recognized by this member of your noble profession . " His cigarette indicated Wade . " The reporter then came over and tried to make Murphy 's play good . " Conroy smiled benignly over Murphy 's shoulder at the policemen and the red-robed figures who had closed in to listen . " He told me I was Valdon , and I , being a meek person , said yes ' and yea ' and verily I am . ' Then I made a liar out of myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and introduced Mr. Cornelius Augustine Conroy , in person . " There was an instant 's pause , broken only by a rustle of whispers from the group behind Murphy . Conroy continued to smoke with amused unconcern . Murphy turned livid with rage . Wade glanced uneasily toward the others . Dutreaux and Matson stood just beyond Murphy , looking as if they only awaited orders to grab this nuisance and trundle him off to face any sort of workout that Murphy 's wrath could devise , and the other policemen who guarded the doors and windows regarded the flippant Mr. Conroy with equal dislike . The robed figures who had not removed their masks ? Wade judged by their comparative sizes that two of these were men and one a woman  --  were standing in a. little group apart , as though enclosed in their shell of anonymity . Cynthia Fontenay sat on the arm of a chair , one hand flung over the back for support . A flicker of amusement lit the bored cynicism of her face as she watched Con Conroy 's performance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , as if inviting him to join in her appreciation , but Barron was staring at a picture on the wall with a black hopelessness that was strange to see on his sensitive features . Lucy was standing uncertainly by Esther Morse , who had sat down on a footstool ; Esther 's face was so drawn and white that Wade thought she might faint , and he was glad Lucy was keeping close to her . He was beginning to admire the saucy competence of Cynthia 's maid , and was glad of her presence . He looked back at Murphy , whose white knuckles suggested that his fists were eager to strike . But  |  | Murphy gave an angry movement of his shoulders and spoke but one terse line . " Take him down and sweat him . " The ready hands of Dutreaux and Matson closed on Conroy 's shoulders . His look of patient astonishment was met only by a low growl from Dutreaux , and in another instant he would have been whisked out of Cynthia 's red and gold apartment into a police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as the concerted strength of Murphy 's assistants gave him a first shove a voice cut in with pre-emptory command . " Just a minute . " The order came with paradoxical authority from behind one of the Brining masks . The man who gave it was reaching for the zipper on his headpiece with a grimness implying that his identity would epitomize his threat . There was a soft ripping noise as the mask came off and revealed the sharp , hard features of Fritz Valdon . Valdon 's was an arresting face , with small eyes and a long thin mouth , the face of a man who talks little and is accustomed to being listened to and obeyed . The two policemen hesitated and Conroy smiled . " This man is my secretary , " Valdon was saying incisively . He threw his mask toward the chair Cynthia was occupying . The mask glanced off her knees and fell on the floor , but neither Valdon nor Cynthia noticed . She was watching him with interest that held a trace of concern as he addressed Murphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time for you to pull up . " Murphy cleared his throat . " I 'm enforcing law and order , Mr. Valdon , and investigating a murder . " His big voice boomed in indignant self-defense . Valdon 's small eyes looked him over . " Well , keep within your bounds . " His eyes slid away from Murphy as from an object of slight interest and he turned to face the reporters . " I 'd like you all to take notice that Murphy is mixing a little practical politics with his police job . He has been annoying Conroy because he thought I might want to leave . He framed it with one of you men to say that I had been recognized as the man wearing robe number 31 . When he found it was Conroy , that irritated him , and he trotted out all the bullying tactics . Very well , Murphy , now that that 's over ? " he switched his attention back to red-faced captain ? " what is it you want to know ? " Murphy rocked on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Search them both , " he ordered gruffly . His voice rose . " Everybody else unmask . Matson , take their names . " Two sergeants , glad to have something definite to do at last , began an energetic frisking of Valdon and Conroy . Conroy smiled tolerantly ; and Valdon submitted with an insolent acquiescence . Matson had started an imperious argument with the last two maskers in the room . " Come on , now , there ai n't no use stalling . Take ' em off . You ai n't got nothing to be scared of , but I got to have your names . That 's right , mister ? " as a hesitating hand went up to rip one zipper ? " take it off . We do n't want to cause you no trouble . " The zipper ripped and the thinned gray hair of an egg-shaped head emerged , followed by a furrowed brow and two small green eyes with reddish lids , a pointed , thin-tipped nose and a weak but cheerful mouth . There was no chin to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritated gentleman . " I am Mark Oliver , " he said . " The toy man ? " Matson scratched the name in his book . " Right , I know you . What 's the address ? " Oliver stood up , wiped some beads of perspiration from his forehead and gave an address in the Metairie section of the suburbs . Wade , who had watched his  | unmasking , was puzzled . This Dis party seemed foreign to the interests that Oliver was known to have . Oliver 's toy shop had given him a widespread reputation , colored by stories of his hermit-like life , . Wade remembered perennial Christmas anecdotes about this man who with no children of his own devoted his life to making other people 's children happy as an inventor of the amusing trickeries that enliven playrooms . His patterns and patents were the basis for the entire programs of numerous manufacturing plants , for Oliver himself did only a little manufacturing . He was said to be worth a good deal of money , and his retreat was a lordly-looking house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed , was looking away from where Oliver and Matson were standing . Oliver walked over to her . Wade could not hear his words , but he saw that Cynthia responded with the slightest of formal nods and turned away again . She walked over to where Matson was interviewing the last masked figure , and watched as the last zipper was pulled open and the last hidden face came to view with the announcement , " I 'm Mrs. Sophie Hildreth . " Matson wrote it down . " Mrs. , " he repeated . " Your husband here , madam ? " Sophie Hildreth gave him a quick , bright , brittle smile , like that of a hostess who must be pleasant though she is suffering agony from a corn . " Yes , he was somewhere here before Captain Murphy sent all those others down to the police station . " " Somewhere here , " Matson echoed dutifully as he recorded the information . " He belong to this outfit that you 're sure of ? " " 0 yes , I know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in fact , it was he who invited me to join . But I have n't seen much of him tonight . " " What 's his first name , ma'am ? "  |  | " Ross . " Sophie was answering with alacrity as if to emphasize her eagerness to be of service . She had a little voice with a faint rasp in it ? a voice that matched her appearance , which was at the same time young and faded : her face was a trifle pinched and her expression almost vinaigrous , and when she pushed back her headdress Wade saw that her hair was faded too , and was of a drab indefinite color . He judged that she was one of those women who are radiant at sixteen and wilted at twenty-five , and he found something pathetic about her stale beauty . She was politely telling Matson that she lived on Chartres Street . " Your husband arrived here the same time you did ? " Matson asked her . " I really do n't know . " Sophie 's thin lips parted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , my husband and I do n't live together . " " No ? " Matson 's lean cheeks creased and his mouth widened , and his whole expression betrayed simple exasperation at these women who could n't keep their minds made up . " You mean you 're divorced ? " " Not yet , " said Sophie sweetly . " But we will be soon . When he gets home you 'll find him at his apartment  --  it 's on St. Peter Street , facing Jackson Square . " There was another zephyr of laughter at Wade 's elbow and he felt Cynthia 's hand on his arm . She beckoned him into a corner . " Please , " she whispered , " get me a drink . " He hesitated , glancing to where Murphy and Valdon were exchanging laconic opinions of each other and then to the whispering cloud of people at the other end of the room , who were regarding one another as if in fear of the intimacy their position had forced upon them . " There 's some liquor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corners of her mouth twitching with suppressed amusement , " and if I do n't get  | a drink soon I shall laugh out loud at that Hildreth woman . Ca n't you see how she 's glaring at me ? " Wade got a bottle , suddenly remembering that Sophie had sent a glance at Cynthia when she told Matson that she and Ross Hildreth occupied separate apartments . He found Lucy beside him with a tray of glasses she had taken from the top of the buffet . He set the decanter on the tray . Cynthia took a drink , and then a second , with an eagerness that crystallized in Wade 's mind a suspicion that had been forming itself since he first came into her house . He excused himself and drew Wiggins aside . " That woman , " he said in an undertone , " is going to be blotto before long . " Wiggins nodded solemnly . " She sure is . " " Ask your friend Lucy if Cynthia is in the habit of getting tight every evening . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sepulchral whisper . " Lucy says not every evening . Not more than three or four nights a week . " " I thought so . " Wade glanced again at Cynthia and then went back to where Matson was still questioning Sophie Hildreth . Sophie 's determined sweetness had become tart . " I tell you , " she insisted sharply , " my husband is a free agent . I do n't keep up with his comings and goings . " " Yes , ma'am . " Matson was unhurried . " But you can swear he was at the party , can you ? Remember nobody took off their masks . " " I can swear it , yes . " " How do you know ? " Matson was slyly searching the list of names that had come over from the Third Precinct . He scowled as though his search had been in vain . Mark Oliver edged a step closer . The others were listening with interest .  | " How did you know ? " Matson repeated . Sophie beckoned him closer . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said in a low voice . " Oh , " said Matson , " then you are n't sure he was here  --  you just thought you recognized him . You could n't swear it was him . " She lifted her head and put her lips close to his ear . " I do n't want the others to hear , " she said . Iler voice dropped . She whispered . Matson started . " You 're sure of that ? " he said . Sophie had dropped back into her chair . She shook her head in birdlike nods that meant yes . " I see , " said Matson . He said nothing else , but put up his notebook and walked smartly off to where Murphy was occupying his attention with Valdon and Con Conroy , then scratching a quick message , he tore the page out of his notebook and gave it to the corporal at the door . " I 've got to duck out of here for a few minutes , " Wade heard him say . " Just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip him this , and do n't forget because it 's important . " As Matson slipped outside Wade followed and plucked his sleeve . " What 's the excitement ? " he asked . Matson hesitated . " Well , do n't print it unless the old man says you can . But that lady in there  --  that Mrs. Hildreth that ai n't living with her husband ? she never saw Parnell 's body , you know . But she says she knows her husband was here . because her husband 's suit was number 47. "  | C H A P T E R E I G H T Wade strolled back into the room , where he saw on a table the collected belongings of Fritz Valdonmoney , keys , a cigarette-case , a folder of matches and a couple of handkerchiefs . Murphy was obviously chagrined . " You were pretty smart , Fritz , " he was saying , " damn smart , and I fell for it . But we ai n't through yet . " Murphy 's jowls creased in what might under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't through . I guess it may be mighty interesting to find out why you were so anxious to get away and would n't take a chance on coming up and trying to arrange it for yourself . " Valdon gave a laugh of arrogant tolerance . " Hell , Murphy , you ca n't mix me up in this . Since you 're so bent on knowing , I just wanted to get away because I thought it would be a bad thing for me with the people . I joined Dis a good many years ago . I do n't come to these doings very often . " Valdon took his case from the table and got out a cigarette . His beady eyes flicked from Murphy to Dutreaux and from Dutreaux to Wade , with sly satisfaction . Murphy growled a greeting to Wade and whisked his atention to Conroy . " What 'd you find on this fellow ? " Dutreaux grinned and extended both his hands . In one was a 38-caliber automatic ; in the other a brown leather wallet , open to show ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of a chair and was blandly watching this display of his property . Murphy wheeled upon him . " What 're you doing with a gun , Conroy ? " he demanded . Conroy sighed and shook his head as if the stupidity  | of the police was something designed to try the souls of citizens . " License to carry firearms issued by a judge of the courts of the State of Louisiana will be found in the wallet along with my driver 's license . " Valdon laid a hand on Conroy 's shoulder . " There wo n't be any trouble about that , Con , " he assured him . Then to Murphy , with emphasis , " This man works for me . I arranged the license for that gun . " Wade took his hand out of his pocket holding a dilapidated cigarette . " Here 's a match , pal , " said Wiggins alongside of his shoulder , and as he accepted the light Wade asked , " How long have you been employed as a secretary , Conroy ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your readers , Mr. Wade , that secretarying is a comparatively new vocation for me . I engaged in it principally for the sake of my health  --  it brought me to your delightfully mild climate . " Wiggins smothered an appreciative chuckle , and Wade caught himself smiling . But Murphy was not amused . " Where d' you live ? " Murphy asked curtly . Conroy bowed . " I live in , sir , with Mr. Valdon . " " Where d' you come from ? " " 0 , yes , that 's a good question . " Conroy tapped his forehead ruminatively . Valdon 's thin lips were curved in a smile of supercilious enjoyment . Conroy considered and then spoke to Wade . " Now you should have asked that , reporter . It 's always interesting for newspaper readers to get the background on people . Shows why and wherefore on certain of their actions . " " I 'm listening , " said Wade . He was studying Conroy with more interest than he had yet vouchsafed to any of the other actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conroy 's cool effrontery had not surprised him , for a henchman of Fritz Valdon had little to fear from ordinary police activities , but Conroy 's assurance had an indescribable and yet definite difference from that of the ordinary bodyguard of a political racketeer . He was keeping them all at bay in a manner that was not explained by calling it arrogance or defiance  --  it was like the attitude of a veteran politician being annoyed by a cub reporter . " I came from a great many places , " Conroy was saying , " and if it ever becomes necessary and I really think you 're interested instead of just being curious , I 'll tell you , and perhaps we 'll find some mutual friends . " " You 're from up North , ai n't you ? " inquired Wiggins . " You talk like it . " Conroy 's mien expressed a dignified grief . " Ah me , " he sighed reproachfully , " if my old father , Colonel Conroy , could hear you say that , young man , he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clicked and he made a pretty bow . " I , sir , " he said , " was born on the broad acres of Conroy 's Plantation . We raised a fair amount of cotton and a great deal of hell up in my country , sir , and what ? " his eyes narrowed and his words began to come like little snaps ? " what the hell do you care where I came from , shrimp ? Screw ! " He faced Murphy . " Now , copper , I 'm not talking until a lawyer tells me to talk , see ? Anything else you want to know , ask me at somebody 's trial . " He and Valdon exchanged smiles . Valdon turned to Murphy . " Inspect that gun , if you please , captain . See that the clip is full and that there 's one bullet in the chamber . " " I 'll turn it over to the district attorney , " Murphy answered , but Valdon clipped his answer short . " No , you are n't going to frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  see ? ? then you can turn it over . " Murphy deliberating turned his back . " Dutreaux , take that gun . Put a tag on it saying it belongs to Mr. Conroy . "  |  | Valdon gave a low snort that reiterated his suggestion that the police department would hear more from him before long . Wade slipped over to Matson . " Let 's see your list , " he said . " I want to be sure that I 've got everybody who has been detained for questioning . " Matson proffered his notebook . Wade caught a look of appeal from Esther Morse and the persistent little glimmer of triumph in Cynthia 's eyes , resolutely ignoring Esther and noting with relief that Cynthia had set the flask on the window-sill , he repeated Matson 's list of names . " ' Mrs. Sophie Hildreth , Dick Barron , Mark Oliver , Miss Esther Morse , Mrs. Cynthia Fontenay , Fritz Valdon , Con Conroy , Miss Lucy Lake . All to be questioned immediately by Murphy ; Arnold Ghent not yet located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I guess that 's all , Matson , except that I 'll remind the office that the dead man wore Ross Hildreth 's costume and was passing himself off as Arnold Ghent , so a little pleasant chit-chat with both those gentlemen should be illuminating . Thanks  --  I ' 11 go phone . Then , seeing Wiggins at his elbow , he added in an undertone , " Try to frame a picture of the bunch . Cover for me  --  I 'm going to call Koppel . " Wiggins slipped him a couple of plates . " Okay . And get these out for me , will you ? That Murphy is a big dumb donkey  --  I knew he 'd get you in a jam . " Wade grinned and mumbled " Nertz " as he went out to phone . He called the city desk , dispatched Wiggins ' plates and came back to discover that Murphy by the simple process of having a little table and an understuffed leather put in the middle of the inferno-like ballroom , had established an impromptu office . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the hall to await his pleasure . A police stenographer sat in a straight-backed chair next to  | Murphy 's and two uniformed men guarded each door . Wiggins , who having made a picture of the scene and sent it through to the office felt that he had done his duty for the present , had ensconced himself on the lowest step of the red throne for a breather . Empty of devil-figures and with the full lights on , the ballroom had a morning-after look . It had become simply a room draped in red silk and decorated with red and black paint , with shoddy details easily apparent  --  just a room fixed up for a rather silly party that had been raided by the cops . Murphy glanced up and nodded as Wade entered , then resumed his instructions to Dutreaux . " Sure , I 'm going to question ' em all . raldon and Conroy and Oliver , and that Barron kid and all those women . I 've had headquarters check up on Ross Hildreth . They say he went to Baton Rouge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want you to see to it ? " There was a confused noise beyond the door that led to the balcony . Matson , in response to a gesture from Murphy , hurried over to slip the bolt and put out his head . " Here 's a new one , " he called over his shoulder . With two uniformed men behind him , another redrobed figure walked into the room . His mask was off and his hood with the horned headdress had been thrown back . He glanced queryingly around for a second , then walked directly up to Murphy . Wade and Wiggins exchanged glances of recognition , for Wiggins ' boast to Lucy earlier in the evening had not been idle . Every news photographer in town knew Arnold Ghent .  | C H A P T E R N I N E " Good evening , Captain Murphy , " he said . " I am Arnold Ghent . " Murphy lay back and his eyes slowly traveled up and down Arnold Ghent , and for a moment he did not speak , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet a new and baroque personality . Ghent stood waiting for recognition , impatient , but not apparently self-conscious , and he returned Murphy 's examination with a scrutiny that was equally detailed , and which , Wade felt as he watched , would be likely to prove more penetrating . Ghent 's naturally dark face had been sunburnt many shades darker , and he walked with the long firm stride of a man who is accustomed to do most of his walking out of doors . Even in his crazy devil-suit he had a hard , muscular look , and one could have guessed his famous athletic triumphs even if one had never heard of them . He was the sort of man who can not be lost in a crowd : his look was piercing , as if his eyes at once stripped the object of his attention of all subterfuges ; his voice , as forceful as his appearance , was the sort that simply can not be reduced to an undertone . As he waited for Murphy to speak his attitude suggested neither irritation nor annoyance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of events . It was with a queerly defensive brusqueness that Murphy finally said : " Well , how do you do , Mr. Ghent ? Have a seat . " Ghent accepted the chair Dutreaux was offering him , and smiled . " They tell me I 'm pretty lucky , captain  --  that I 'm supposed to be dead . " " You sure are , " volunteered Wiggins , who had wriggled over to a better point of vantage . " Your obit was already in type when my partner Wade called up to say Mr. Ghent was n't dying this evening . " Ghent regarded hint with humorous indulgence . Murphy looked grimly at his new acquaintance . " You were at this party tonight , were you ? " he started . " No , I was ready for the ball , but I was  --  er  --  prevented from attending . " Ghent had stretched his long legs in front of him and looked at his red satin slippers as if in apology for his whole fantastic attire . " Prevented , were you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had come in with Ghent . " Where 'd you find him ? " he asked . " At his apartment , sir . " the man answered . " Tied up . " " Tied up , eh ? " Murphy turned on a leg of his chair to face his subordinate . " Tied up , was he ? In his own house ? Well , tell me about it . " " Sure , cap'n , sure . We went from headquarters , you know , soon as the call came from here to find Mr. Ghent . We knocked on his door and nobody answered , but we heard some sort of moving around inside , so I says to Lalland here , ' Let 's go in , ' I says , so we tried the door and it was n't locked , so we went right in . There was n't nobody in the front room , but we heard noises like somebody bumping around , and we went into the next room which was the bedroom , and there was this gentleman with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a rope , and blindfolded , and gagged with a towel , fighting like a bull to get hisself untied . Part of the bedclothes was burned like somebody 'd tried to set fire to the house . So Lalland holds a gun in case he 's violent , and I take the towel off and he says he 's Arnold Ghent and for God 's sake to get him loose . Which I do , and I tell him a guy named Parnell is dead which everybody thought was him , and we bring him here to talk to you . " " Huh , " Murphy said expressively . " That right , Ghent ? "  |  | Ghent gave a slow nod of confirmation . " Entirely right , Captain Murphy . " " Suppose , " said Murphy , " you tell us what happened to you . " Ghent considered an instant , absently chafing one wrist , where a red circle showed the recent presence of a rope . He glanced at the reporters . " I hope you understand , Captain Murphy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of what 's been going on this evening , and I 'm still pretty badly shaken up . So if I do n't make myself quite clear do n't hesitate to interrupt me . " " I wo n't , " Murphy promised shortly . " Who tied you up ? " Ghent did not answer directly . " I suppose I 'd better begin with what happened before I was tied up . The beginning , as far as I was concerned , happened about ten o'clock . I was getting dressed for the Dis ball when I got a phone call from Roger Parnell . " " Parnell , eh ? " Murphy muttered . " 0 yes , I had known him for years , though we were never very intimate friends . We were in prep school together . He said he wanted to see me . I asked him if tomorrow would n't do , for I did n't want to be seen in this Dis outfit  --  I suppose you know that we do n't like to make public our connection with Dis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murphy nodded with easy carelessness suggesting that he had learned the mysteries of Dis along with the alphabet . " Parnell insisted that he had to see me at once , Ghent continued . " He sounded pretty excited , so I told him I could see him in about twenty minutes . I thought I could slip out of this robe and put on a dressing-gown before he got there , but I do n't think it was more than two minutes later that he walked in. , , " Your door was n't locked ? " asked Murphy . " No  --  I live in the Pontalba apartments on St. Peter Street , and they are n't very modern . I know most of the occupants of the apartments near mine , and we rarely lock doors . " " I see . " But Murphy 's nod was impatient , for like most practical folk he had little understanding of bohemian vagaries . " What happened ? " " Well  --  something that perhaps you can explain better than I can . " Ghent was frowning . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had on a Dis costume . He was carrying the mask in his hand . I thought he must be considerably agitated , for I 'd never known a member of Dis to reveal his identity . It 's just one of the things we do n't do . I was annoyed , too , that Parnell should have come so soon after his call , for I 'd had no time to get my own costitime off , so I probably was n't very enthusiastic when I greeted him . IIe sat down in the living room . I asked him what was on his mind . He said , Ghent , I 'm in a hell of a mess . I 'm desperate , and you 've got to help me . ' " I told him I 'd do anything I could , though I thought it strange that he should come to me , for as I said , we were never on very intimate terms and I knew he had some powerful friends . I asked him if it was money he needed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he asked me for a pencil and paper . I got them for him , and he stood up and began to sketch a rough map of Jackson Square . " Ghent paused a moment . " I was bewildered by his actions . He was nervous , but he seemed perfectly sane . " Murphy 's face was expressionless , but his eyes were on a straight line with Ghent 's , and he was listening closely . Ghent pushed back his chair and stood up . " Here 's what he did . He laid the paper on the table like this ? " Ghent drew Murphy 's notebook toward him and bent over as though writing in it . " Then he handed me the pencil and asked me if I  |  | would mark an X where each of the park entrances was . I took the pencil and leaned over to mark the positions of the park gates , and he must have stepped back , for the next thing I knew a rope had dropped past my face and bound my arms , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you put up a fight ? " Murphy asked with interest . " Lord , no . I 'd not have hesitated with the chances even , but I was n't going to try it against that knife . " Murphy nodded in agreement , and Ghent went on . " Parnell told me that if I turned around he would kill me . Then he slipped a blindfold over my face , held the rope tight around my arms and shoved my head down against the table-top with his elbow . In another instant he had a rope around my legs , then he dragged me into the bedroom , threw me on the bed , trussed me up like a turkey , gagged me with a towel and took off my Dis ring . " " Took your ring , did he ? " Murphy leaned toward him with increasing interest . " Just what kind of knife was it that he had ? " " I never saw it . After he trussed me up he took the blindfold off me only for a minute . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was safely tied up and could n't move , I heard him say that he was going to take off the gag but that if I put up a howl he 'd kill me . Then he slipped it off , that and the blindfold , and asked me to tell him what was the password for the Dis ball . " Ghent glanced at the group of reporters . " I told him to go to hell . " " You knew he was n't a member of Dis ? " Wade asked . " Not until then . When I saw him wearing a Dis costume I assumed that he was a member , and during the performance that terminated with his taking my ring I was n't doing much reasoning of any sort , but  | when he took off that gag and demanded tonight 's password I understood of course that all this was just a way of getting himself into the Dis ball . Why he wanted to get in I did n't know , but I figured that he could n't have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murphy . " He did something that sent my blood cold . " Ghent rested his elbows on the table and looked over his crossed arms directly to Murphy . " He picked up an edge of a sheet on the bed and lit his cigarette-lighter and set fire to the sheet . " " Must have been crazy , " Wade commented . " No , he did n't seem crazy , " Ghent demurred . " He seemed even to have lost the nervousness I had noticed when he first came in . He was perfectly sane and very much in earnest . He looked down at me. as I layV there helpless as a baby with that sheet burning close to me , and said , I told you I was in a hell of a fix , Ghent , but so are you . You 'll either tell me enough to get me into Dis tonight , or so help me God I 'll burn down this house and you in it . ' " Ghent reached among the folds of his robe and got out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the password was Persephone . ' He smothered the flame with the hearthrug . " " Then he left ? " Murphy asked . " Not right away , " said Ghent . He hesitated , then went on . " Under ordinary circumstances , Captain Murphy  --  I mean if nothing serious had developed from Parnell 's visit to the Dis ball  --  I might have kept this to myself . I know that whatever it was that turned the easy-going chap Parnell always was into the cold-blooded proposition he appeared tonight must have been something pretty desperate . " " Go on , boy , " Murphy permitted himself a gleam of understanding . " I know how you feel . " " Well  --  Parnell made very sure that the fire on the bed was out . He opened a window , asked me if I  | felt all right , put a pillow under my head , sat down on the edge of the bed , and put a cigarette into my mouth and lit it for me . " Ghent 's sunburnt features contracted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost green and his eyes looked like a man 's when he is going down into the water for the third time , and yet there was n't a shake in his hands or a tremor in his voice . I 'll try to remember exactly what he said . It might be important . " He paused for a moment , thoughtfully . " Here 's as nearly as I can remember , and I think it 's pretty accurate . IIe said , ' Arnold , I know you 're a sportsman . I 'm depending on that . I realize of course that you do n't understand my actions here tonight , and I realize too that if you broadcast them I 'm finished in New Orleans . But I want to get into Dis tonight worse than I ever wanted to do anything else in my life . I 'm desperate , and it 's my only way out . ' He looked straight at me . If I find , ' he said , that I ca n't get in , that you 've fooled me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , because you will be responsible for my failing in a last attempt to save my personal honor and the honor of someone who means more to me than anything else in the world . ' " Is that all he said ? " Murphy asked when Ghent paused . " No . He told me that he had to leave me trussed up so I could n't possibly get to the ball , because he knew that every member was accounted for and one extra guest might cause Cynthia to start an inquiry . Then he added that he would give me one more chance to tell him the truth . I took it that he meant I was to tell him if I had given him a false password . I told him to go ahead to the ball , and even promised him , I 'm afraid , that if he could justify what he had done I 'd say nothing about it . He did n't answer . He got up and put the blindfold and the gag back on  | me , and I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more after that . As I heard him turn the doorknob , he said , ' Frog ' ? that 's a name they used to call me in prep school ? ' Frog , I may never get a chance to explain this . But if I do n't , please try to remember that it was something I had to do . ' " Ghent reached again into the folds of his robe for a handkerchief and wiped a little frost of perspiration off his forehead . " And that , " he finished , his voice curiously low and taut , " was the last time I saw Roger Parnell . "  | CHAPTER T E N " So that 's the last time you saw Parnell , eh ? " " Yes . I did n't see anybody else until your men came in and untied me . " Murphy stroked his rubicund cheeks and looked musingly at the reporters and at Wiggins perched on the steps of the throne . " When 's the last time you saw him before tonight , Mr. Ghent ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the street and he asked me to come up to his apartment for a drink . I did n't stay long not more than half an hour . " " What was he like then ? Seem to have anything on his ' Mild ? " Ghent considered . " I should n't say so . You understand , Captain Murphy , that I was never a close friend of his , and I do n't think he 'd have confided in me . " " I thought you said you 'd known him since you went to school . " " I had , but we never were good friends . " " Did n't think much of him , eh ? " Ghent 's stern face relaxed into a deprecating smile . " After all , captain , Parnell 's dead , and that was years ago . It ca n't mean anything now . He just struck me , when I was a boy , as a fellow who was a little too sharp and too wise , and I never made any effort to make friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's he been in town ? " " Two or three years . I did n't know he was living here till I ran into him on the street one day . " " I get you . " Murphy crossed his big arms over the table and leaned forward . " Do you know what his business was ? " Ghent shrugged . " I suppose there 's no harm in saying it now  --  be was the money man at the Red Cat over in Jefferson Parish . "  | " That 's what I thought , " Murphy affirmed with a satisfied nod . " Now , Mr. Ghent , when he came to see you tonight , do you really think he 'd have killed you if you had n't told him how to get into this party ? " Ghent raised his black eyebrows and lowered them slowly , as though to imply that there might be doubt in some minds but not in his . " He seemed pretty desperate , Captain Murphy . " " But you said you would n't have borne him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it later . Is that right ? " " Well ? " Ghent laughed shortly ? " I like to think it is . Of course I was mad . Maybe it 's just a conclusion I arrived at after I heard he was dead . " Murphy thumbed the pages of his notebook . " What time did he leave your house ? " " I should say about eleven o'clock . " " How long would it take him to get here ? " asked Murphy , scratching down the figures . " About five minutes in a cab . " " Oh , he had a cab ? " " He called one after he tied me up . I forgot to mention it . " " And he did n't say anything to you but what you 've told us ? " " Not a thing . " " Just that stuff about it being an affair of honor . A woman , you think ? " " It might have been . He always had plenty of women friends . But I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think that 's all for the present , Mr. Ghent . You can go outside now , but I wish you 'd kind of stay around . There might be a few more things I 'll want to ask you . I 'm much obliged . " " I 'll be outside if you want me , then . " Ghent rose , and Murphy walked to the door with him , followed by Wiggins , who trotted placidly off  | for a photograph . As he closed the door Murphy turned to face the reporters . " What do you think of that guy , boys ? " " If he 's lying , " said Kennedy of the Telegram , " he 's a mighty straight liar . " " He sure is . He do n't seem to overdo it any . Of course , he may be crooked all the way through , but he looks straight , and unless we can find out some sort of motive for him killing Parnell , I guess we might as well believe him . " Murphy sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 've got his address ? " " Sure . " " Ross Hildreth lives at the same place , just above Ghent . Parnell had on Hildreth 's costume when he was killed . I figure Parnell called Ghent from Hildreth 's apartment and came down right away . " " That 's reasonable . I 'm kind of itching to talk to that guy Hildreth . I 'm having him brought down from Baton Rouge . " " His being in Baton Rouge does n't give him an alibi , " Wade reminded . " Anybody can drive here from Baton Rouge in two hours , and a man set on getting himself an alibi for murder could do it in considerably less . " Murphy leaned glumly back on the hind legs of his chair , looking up without interest as Wiggins bounced in , beaming . " Get the picture ? " Wade asked . " Sure . Say , do you think that guy Parnell was killed over a woman ? " " I do n't know , " said Wade . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked it up that it 's Cynthia 's fault that the Hildreths are separated . " " Rats , " said Wiggins , " I coulda told you that . I seen Cynthia and that guy Hildreth together a lot , around the racetrack . When Lucy told me Cynthia  | was gonta get married again , I guessed the next husband was Hildreth and she sorta shied me off . " " Probably because the Hildreths are n't divorced yet , " Wade surmised . " Still , I 'm inclined to think there 's something else in this business besides some man 's liking some woman . " " F'r instance ? " " I wish I knew . But I do n't . Ghent 's story fits . If it 's not true , it 's been cut to fit . The men did find him tied up , the bedclothes had been burned , and we can check up on whether there was a taxi called from that address at that time . " " I 'll have Matson do it right away , " said Murphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was killed . This rigor mortis stuff is all right , but sometimes it throws you a couple of hours off . " " Hell ! " Wiggins sprang up . " Why did n't you ask me ? " " Ask you ? Were you there ? " Murphy 's scorn was profound . " No , but ? " ' Wiggins slapped his knee . " Lord , I forgot something . " He jumped back to where his camera was and swooped upon it . " Look , Murphy . If that cop at the door will tell Lucy she 's got to come with me , I 'll maybe bring something back . "  | CHAPTER ELEVEN Mr. Wiggins of the Creole , like most young gentlemen who take photographs for the daily press , had attained eminence in his vocation not only because he could handle a camera but also because of his smallness of stature , which enabled him to wriggle unobserved through a crowd of hostile humanity or through half-open windows of guarded dwellings . So it was no subject for surprise that Wiggins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his roadster without being observed by anybody but the single policeman who stood at the gate and who had received orders to send Lucy with him . Wiggins opened the car door and grandly assisted Lucy inside , then ran around and slithered himself under the steering-wheel . " You okay , honey ? " he inquired . Lucy nodded . She had put on a coat , and had exchanged her bit of organdie headgear for a little dark hat . Wiggins examined her approvingly by the light of a street-lantern . " You warm enough ? " " I 'm plenty warm , " said Lucy . " Let 's go , then . " Wiggins slipped in the clutch . He turned off Royal Street and into St. Peter , chugging at a leisurely rate along the dark side of the Cabildo toward Jackson Square . Another turn headed them downtown toward the old cathedral . " Well , " said Lucy at length , " what 's the big idea ? " Wiggins grinned at the stubborn profile outlined by the lanterns . " Just going bye-bye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you taking me ? " " Now do n't get all excited , babe , " said Wiggins soothingly . " I just had to go by the office a minute and I figured you might like to get away from that  | place a little while , so I asked Murphy to let you come with me . " " Humph . To let me come with you ! To order me to come , you mean . " " Now do n't be sore , baby . Did n't Murphy say it would be okay ? " " You listen to me . I do n't have to have the police department make my dates . Where are we going ? " Her back was straight and her blue eyes blazing . But Mr. Wiggins of the Creole was not disturbed . He had the smiling audacity which is rarely found except in young children , movie stars and reporters with a nose for news . " Say , you 're like all women . Any time you try to give a girl a break she thinks you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A break ? Thanks . " " No foolin ' , babe , " he exclaimed , " I was beginning to worry about you , and I figured I 'd get you out of the place . Tell the truth , ai n't this thing getting on your nerves ? " " Well , " she admitted grudgingly , " I never saw so many policemen in one place before . When they took Mr. Parnell 's body out to the morgue it kind of gave me the creeps . Gee , I wish it was all over . " Wiggins let Lucy think about this a moment before he answered . " So do I , babe , " he told her solemnly . " Murphy 's really on the warpath . " He turned back into Royal Street and started uptown . Lucy snuggled further into her seat and looked silently out at the dark old walls of the Quarter . The white blaze of light at the end of Royal Street widened , and they entered Canal Street , glaring and enormous , and empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and newsboys calling headlines about the murder at the Dis ball . Wiggins went on . " You know , I wanted to talk to you about something . That 's why I got you out . "  | " I thought there must be something on your mnid , " she answered coolly . " This is a queer time to have a date . What did you want ? " Wiggins pulled up to the curb and stopped . " Well you 're trying to give me the old runaround , see , and I do n't like it . " His manner was that of a man with a grievance . " I do n't like it , " he went on , " because I think you 're doing the wrong thing . " " I 'm not doing anything . " Lucy 's voice expressed a fine degree of puzzlement . " I do n't know what you mean . " " Look , babe , " Wiggins started seriously . " I 'm working this story for my paper , y'understand ? I know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got some authority too . I work with Wade and Murphy all the time when a story like this breaks . " " So , " she interrupted calmly , " what 's that make me ? Front page stuff or something ? " " No , " he said vehemently . " But I want to take care of you . " " Thanks , " she retorted with good-natured irony , " but I 've been doing that little job for myself very well . " Wiggins became stern . " Yeah ? Is that what made you lie about that Fontenay woman 's marriages ? " Lucy leaned back . " Oh , you 're still talking about that . I did n't lie to you I just made a mistake . I should n't have talked to you about it anyway . " Wiggins shook an unbelieving head . " You know you lied . Why do n't you get right ? You know Mrs. Fontenay lied too . She said she 'd been married twice and you said you counted wrong . Malarkey . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . " Say , Tony Wiggins , what is this ? The third degree or something ? I 'm going to get out of this car and you can think anything you please . " She opened the door . " Sit down . " Wiggins snatched her back and banged  | the door shut . " You ai n't going no place till we get right , understand ? " Lucy sat down . She drew herself as far as possible from him and eyed him scornfully . " I understand , " she said hotly . " You 're a punk that wants to be a cop . Well , you 're wrong trying it on me . You got a lot of authority ; you help Murphy and Wade . ' You make me laugh . " " So that 's what you think . " He was plainly indignant . " You think I 'm trying to be a big guy or something . " His face was poked close to hers and his fists clenched on his knees . " You think I wanta be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chump . Go to the front for that old biscuit you work for . Go ahead , give me the bird . And where 'll you wind up ? Where 'll you wind up ? " His voice was taunting . " I 'll tell you . You 'll wind up in the can making aprons for orphan asylums . " Lucy laughed . " That 's a swell line . You 'll make a lovely detective when you grow up . But I got scared once tonight and I 'm over it now , see ? " Wiggins ' hands opened in a gesture of finality . " All right , babe . " His voice expressed baf'led resignation . " Let it go at that . You go through for that dame and she 'll put you in the grease any minute she thinks it 's gonta help her . " " No she wo n't . You do n't know her . " " I know her plenty . Now tell me . How many times has she been married ? " " Twice . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're hopeless . No matter what I tell you you 're gonta be a dummy and take the rap on this thing . I guess you better get out and walk . " " Tony , I ca n't tell you  --  All right , I 'll go . " She reached for the door . " You stay here . " Wiggins grabbed her arms . " I ai n't gonta let you take any rap . Before I went up  | tonight to make that first picture you told me Cynthia 's next husband would be her fourth . Now what do you want to lie about it for ? Tell me you ca n't add up . It 's no trouble to add up one and one and one . Why do n't you give yourself a break ? " Lucy drew a long breath . She turned around and faced him . " Listen , Tony . Maybe there 's some things you do n't understand . Mrs. Fontenay 's been good to me . She 's treated me like a human being . And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talking about her , see ? " " Yeah . I see . I figured she 'd be like that . She 'll be nice to anybody as long as it do n't bother her none . But when she gets in a hole  --  you saw what she did when Murphy was giving her the quiz , did n't you ? She tried to hang this job around that Morse girl 's neck . You saw that . " " Yes , " Lucy retorted valiantly , " but she did n't want to . " Wiggins laughed . " Did n't want to  --  you must be nertz . Sure she wanted to . Otherwise she 'd have kept her face closed . " Lucy did not answer . " Listen , Lucy , let me ask you one question . Do you think Cynthia killed Parnell ? " Lucy shook her head . " All right then . Why did she say she was only married twice ? " Lucy considered . " I guess ? " her voice was low and troubled ? " She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ' Wiggins felt something click inside him . He 'd been sure he was right . There was a husband that Cynthia forgot . " But do n't you think she 's crazy to try and hide it ? " he demanded . " They 'll start checking up on her story and find it out . "  | " That 's her business , " said Lucy . " Not mine . " Wiggins waxed persuasive . " Listen , babe , I 'm giving it to you straight , so help me God I am . Holding back wo n't get her anything . The more she lies the more she 'll have to lie and when they trip her up it 'll look lousy . You 're in the same fix . I would n't mind if she was your kind of person  --  on the level and decent  --  but she ai n't . Murphy 's bound to ask you a lot of questions . Tell him the truth . You got nothing to hide . Why did she say she 'd had only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honey , and I 'll see that she do n't find out where I got it . " Lucy considered . " You wo n't fool me , Tony ? You wo n't let her know I told ? " " Of course I wo n't . " " She 's going to marry Mr. Hildreth as soon as he gets a divorce . Mrs. Hildreth has been holding it up . " " And he 'll be the fourth , wo n't he ? " Lucy nodded . " Pull up under the light . " Wiggins started the car . As it stopped under a street-light Lucy opened her pocketbook . She hesitated , and looked up at the street-light . In the thin river-fog it looked like a flame shining through cotton . She looked back at the pocketbook in her hands . " One day last week , " said Lucy , " ? it was the time she told me she was going to get married again ? she got out her bond box and tore up a lot of old papers . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of letters too . She burned them up in the grate . Well , there was a little bitty box . She threw that in the fire on top of the letters and it must have rolled off . She was drinking pretty hard and getting kind of a crying jag on . She told me never to get married . Said she had done it three times and would n't be doing it again except that she was a damn fool . Then she went to sleep . I saw 1S , the box on the edge of the fireplace . It was just burned a little bit . I thought maybe she had thrown it in by mistake because she was drinking . I opened it and found something I thought she might regret putting in the fire because it was valuable . Here it is . " She opened her hand . Wiggins saw that she held a wedding ring . " Look inside , " Lucy prompted . He held it down to the dashboard and switched on the light . The inscription , engraved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been half-consciously expecting . " Cynthia Ludlam  --  Roger Parnell December 19 , 1916. "  |  | C H A P T E R T W E L V E Wiggins spent nearly a quarter of an hour in the photographers ' rooms of the Creole building before returning to where he had left Lucy waiting downstairs behind the want-ad counter . She came out to meet him questioningly . " What have you been doing , Tony ? " " Just looking over some negatives they put through the tanks for me . " " What are they for ? " she asked as they went out . " Do n't know yet , " Wiggins said . " I got a couple of ' em here in the envelope . We got ta see . " Ho climbed into the car . Lucy looked anxiously at him through the dark as he pressed the started . " Tony , do you know anything that 's going to put Mrs. Fontenay in a jam ? " " I do n't know , babe . Honest I do n't . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was driving fast . Lucy caught her breath as the wind whizzed past her and spoke vehemently . " Tony , if you do anything to get her in trouble I 'll never forgive you , or myself either . " For a moment Wiggins did not answer . But as they entered the Quarter and the narrow street forced him to slacken his speed , he replied with earnest conviction . " It 's this way , Lucy . I got a coupla negatives . She used to be Mrs. Parnell . That either puts her in or out . If she 's not right for the job this dope ca n't hurt her and if she 's right for it she ought a be hurt . " Lucy sighed . Wiggins hurriedly parked his roadster behind a big police car and bidding her stick around inside and see what happened , he went upstairs . At the door of the ballroom he almost collided with Fritz Valdon . Wiggins looked up innocently . " Howdy , Mr. Valdon , " he greeted .  | " Hello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was well pleased with his interview with Wade and Murphy . " Keeping you busy ? " " They sure are , " Wiggins replied non-committally , and went in . He hurried over to Wade and Murphy . " Well , " he said , " whatcha know ? " Wade grinned and shook his head . " Nothing much . Valdon has decided to be nice , so he told us about the Dis meeting tonight . Murphy 's trying to make out a time-table to determine just when Parnell got it . " Wiggins pulled up a chair and chuckled as he glanced at Murphy laboring over a list of figures . " What did Valdon say ? " " Well ? " Wade 's forehead puckered in a series of lines ? " he told us that this initiation shindig took place at about a quarter of twelve . First there was a lot of business about honoring the guest of honor and that sort of thing . Then , at a quarter of twelve , they sent her out  --  told her to wait in Cynthia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members could witness . It 's really quite a performance , with lighted devils ' heads and solemn proclamations of the dreadful consequences to anyone who tells the secrets of Dis . Most of it is done with the lights out . Valdon says the room was dark for ten or fifteen minutes . It seems reasonable that somebody who was smart enough to slip past the teller at the door might go out and kill Parnell and get back in without being noticed . " " About a quarter to twelve , you say ? " Wiggins scowled and tried to remember . " You mean he 'd go out and go back to the china-closet ? Look  --  I was here about that time , and the butler told me I 'd have to wait . When I finally went up Cynthia said they 'd been having a meeting . " " And what 's that prove ? " " Nothing much  --  except that when the butler left me in the courtyard he walked upstairs and went  | around the gallery to the back . Now ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallery ? " " Fine ! " Wade exclaimed . " That 's one of the things we wanted to know . Listen to this , Murphy . " He hastily recounted what Wiggins had pointed out . Murphy was grateful . " Good boy . We 'll just jump down and see that nigger in a little while . He 's safe where he is , and the more we 've got to tell him the more liable he 'll be to talk . " Wiggins pouted his lips in a disdainful grimace . " Yeah . Well , if I got to do all the police work here one of you guys might just as well learn how to make pictures . Look what I got . " He took out the negatives and prints he had brought from the office . " Here 's your time-table , Murphy , " he announced grandly , and as the other two bent closer to see he went on . " This is the picture I took of the party before anybody knew anything was wrong . I know it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was waiting down there in the courtyard , and when I went up Cynthia said I 'd been kept waiting because they 'd been having a meeting . Just before I shot the bunch I asked her how many there were . She said forty-nine Dis members and one guest . You can see the guest  --  she 's Esther , in the middle of the front row in a white dress . And Cynthia said forty-nine others , see ? " They nodded . " Well , " announced Wiggins , " count the heads . There 's forty-eight . " Murphy 's fist banged the table . " Then that settles it , boys . " " You bet it does , " Wiggins assured him . " Look . Parnell left Ghent all tied up at about eleven . He musta spent some time in the ballroom because some people saw him . Let 's give him twenty minutes doing his stuff in here . That would give him time to get  | out to the pantry before the lights-out meeting , would n't it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife while the room was dark , and the guy that did the killing came back in here while it was still dark , because he was here when I made the picture . Now it ai n't possible that I left one figure off the end , because I made two pictures just in case one was blooey , and there 's forty-eight devils in each of ' ern . " Murphy had been counting heads with a thick forefinger . He looked up . " Pretty good work , boy , " he said with rare generosity . " You better let me keep these plates . " " Sure . " Wiggins found himself a cigarette and began to blow smoke rings with the nonchalance of the expert who really does n't want to brag . " Something else you might like to know , Murph . Just a cute little bit of evidence . " He eyed Murphy with a fine air of mystery . " I sort of looked through some old , old papers down in the files at the office , and I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husbands . " " What 's that ? " Murphy demanded . " I thought as much . Anybody we know ? " " And how , " said Mr. Wiggins with lordly assurance . " She forgot the first one . Roger Parnell . " Murphy started up , his blue eyes snapping . " I knew it ; " he raged , poking his cigar at Wade 's face . " I new that dame was fishy . " He glared at Wiggins . " All right , me laddybuck , we 'll see what she has to say . I 'll get her myself . " Emitting an uncomplimentary monosyllable , he strode to the door . ' Wiggins trotted after him , and Wade followed . Murphy banged his way into the dining-room . Cynthia and Arnold Ghent , chattering vivaciously , were the center of the group . They were all talking ,  | with a bright artificial gaiety and determined little interpolations of laughter , except Esther Morse , who sat on a sofa at one side of the room , her forehead resting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped in the middle of a drawling speech and threw a quizzical glance at Wade , and the police officers nearby snapped to rigid attention . " Let everybody go home , " said Murphy shortly to Matson . He looked at nobody else , as if saving his contacts with the others for a more fruitful time . " Give Valdon and Conroy a receipt for that junk you took off them and bring it to me in the other room . Then I want to see Mrs. Fontenay . " He stamped out again and took up his position by his table in the ballroom . Wade surveyed him with a grin , but said nothing . A moment later Matson came in with the black wallet he had taken from Conroy and laid it on the table . " Have they gone ? " Murphy demanded . " They 're going , sir . " " Fine . Send in that Fontenay female . " As Matson left , Murphy took out his badly bitten cigar and motioned vigorously toward Wade and Wiggins . " Now look here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this dame you keep your faces shut , get me ? This is business . " It was several minutes before Cynthia came in . She entered and walked up to them without a suggestion of fear or timidity in her manner , and her smile was graciously apologetic . She had utilized the delay to change her Dis robe for a pair of black velvet pajamas with trailing trousers and puffed sleeves , and her bright golden hair framed her face with ripples of such exquisite faultlessness that Wiggins suddenly felt for Lucy the involuntary reverence he paid to anyone who was particularly good at his job . In one hand Cynthia held a cigarette in a long jade holder , and in the other a highball ; but nothing but a faint glassi-  | ness of her eyes betrayed the effect of the liquor she had been drinking all evening . Wiggins caught himself trying to calculate how much she must have had , and confirming his own earlier opinion that the trouble with Cynthia Fontenay was that she had always had too much of everything , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wondered if there was anything on earth that could get her really upset . Certainly she did not appear disturbed at the prospect of this interview . She was cool and ever so slightly patronizing as she accepted the chair Wade offered her , and said smilingly to Murphy , " I 'm so sorry I kept you waiting , captain . But I had to speed the parting guests . " She sipped her drink and looked archly at him across the rim of the glass . " And even you must agree , Captain Murphy , that it has been a very trying party . " " Yes , ma'am , I suppose it has . " Murphy 's voice was bland , but there was menace in his eyes . " There 's just a few things I want to talk over with you , ma'am . " " Certainly , " said Cynthia . " Ca n't I offer you a drink first ? There 's some whiskey on the stand in the corner . " " No , that 's all right . I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , " she interrupted pleasantly . " I suppose I ought to tell you that we decided outside that since Mr. Parnell was not a member of Dis , and since we 're sure he could n't have been killed by anyone who was a member of Dis , we would have the Dis parade anyhow tomorrow . " She smiled . " The floats are all ready , and it seems a shame to disturb the order of Mardi Gras . Nothing has ever interrupted a Mardi Gras program except the World War , you know , and this is n't as serious as that . We decided , you see , " she added as though explaining as politely as possible something he could not be expected to understand , " that Mr. Parnell was probably killed by some prowler  | who climbed into the closet to steal the spoons . I hope you are n't shocked , Captain Murphy . " " No , Mrs. Fontenay , I 'm not shocked . " Murphy shook his head . " But I guess I 'm just a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get about the world in general as it 's being run today , but a cop 's life is made up of plenty of things he do n't understand . He gets used to not being shocked at anything . " He paused , and watched her delicately tasting her drink . Cynthia 's smile had not altered . " Then you do n't think ? " " I ai n't thinking , " said Murphy rudely . " It ai n't any of my business about your parade . I 'm just concerned right now with you . " " With me ? " Her thin arched eyebrows lifted inquiringly . " Do I shock you ? " Murphy folded his big hands on the table in front of him and looked at her with a straight hard stare . " Mrs. Fontenay , " he said , " I 've seen all kinds of women and I 've seen them do all kinds of things . But never in my life have I seen the widow of a man who 'd just been murdered carry on like you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattle before his sentence was ended . For a moment she said nothing . She simply stared at him . Her whole expression had changed ; it was like what happens when a painter removes the false face that has been laid on over the real portrait on a canvas . The gay banter of her look had become hard , bitter , furious ; her voice when she spoke rasped like a rusty wire . " Damn you ! " she said . " Why did n't you tell me you knew ? " Murphy 's jaw had set grimly . His thick forefinger pointed at her in inexorable challenge . " Mrs. Roger Parnell , " he said , " who killed your hus-band ? " Cynthian 's hands gripped the sides of the little table as though she would have liked to feel it break . She  | began to laugh . " Mrs. Parnell ! " she repeated . She laughed as though she found the name bitterly ridiculous . " Are you trying to make me do an Enoch Arden ? " She laughed and laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That marriage was annulled . I was too young . I 'll show you the papers if you do n't believe it  --  I 've got them somewhere . " " Who killed your husband ? " Murphy demanded . " I do n't know ! " she sprang up . She was almost screaming . " I did n't kill him , and I ca n't be frightened into saying I did by any damn fool of a half-witted cop . You 've found out I was married to him  --  all right , I was . But I did n't kill him . Do you hear me ? ? 1 did n't kill him . " " Sit down , " barked Murphy . She did not move . She looked down at him , one corner of her mouth curling in angry contempt . Murphy pushed back his chair and stood up . " Mrs. Parnell , " he exclaimed , " you 're a hard and unchastened woman . You 've lied to me tonight , lied and lied . Now I 'm going to give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm going to get . Get it out of you here , right now . Who killed Roger Parnell ? " " You go to hell , " said Cynthia . For an instant she stood quite still . Then , suddenly , she crumpled up into her chair , her head on her outcrossed arms , sobbing . Her words came brokenly , muffled and hardly understandable , between her sobs . " What in God 's name are you trying to do to me ? ? I have n't done anything ! ? Do you want me  --  to tear myself  --  up  --  into little pieces  --  for you ? Why do n't you let me alone ? " The rest was disjointed syllables . Wade silently got up and tiptoed around the table to where Murphy was still standing , looking down at Cynthia 's bent golden ' head . " Let me talk to her , " said Wade in a low voice . Murphy hesitated . He looked down at Cynthia 's quiv-  | ering shoulders . " Think you can do any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm in favor of sweating it out of her here and now . " " I 'm afraid , " Wade demurred in a half-whisper , " that wo n't get you anywhere . Let me try . " Murphy looked down at Cynthia again , and across at Wiggins . Wiggins nodded vigorously . Wiggins had had enough experience of Wade 's police work to feel assured that Wade was a more adequate questioner than Murphy in a situation of this sort . Murphy looked back at Wade , and yielded . " Okay , " he said briefly , and beckoned to Wiggins . They went to the far end of the room , behind Cynthia 's back , and sat down . Wade slipped over to the buffet and got a decanter of whiskey . He waited till Cynthia 's wild sobs had quieted . " Mrs. Fontenay , " he said . She looked up . " Where 's that idiot policeman ? " she asked . " He 's here , but he wo n't bother you now . " Wade poured out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you . " She drank it gratefully . " Thank you , " she said . Then , " Can I go now ? " She spoke like a whipped child . " I 'm afraid you ca n't , not yet . " Wade sat down . " That is , of course you can if you want to , but I think you 'd prefer to stay and talk to me if you knew what it meant to be taken down to police headquarters for questioning . " As she started to retort he shook his head to enjoin silence . " Mrs. Fontenay , " he said , " I do n't want to threaten you , but that 's what will happen in the morning if you wo n't talk to me tonight . " Cynthia wiped her eyes and looked down at the flimsy little handkerchief in her hand . " But why do they torment me so ? " she exclaimed . " I did n't kill him . " " But you did n't tell the truth about him , " Wade reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 've been a fool  | all my life , " she said wearily . " I 've done a lot of silly things , but I 've never killed anybody . Why should I ? " " Mrs. Fontenay , " said Wade , " why did n't you tell us you 'd been married to Parnell ? " She swallowed the drink . It seemed to restore her confidence . She smiled . " Why , because I did n't want you to know . It was n't any of your business . " He smiled back . " I 'm afraid it is , now . You see , when you told us you 'd been married only twice , it made it pretty obvious that there was a good reason why you wanted us to think Parnell was only a casual acquaintance of yours . Why were you afraid to tell us you had been married to him ? " " Because he 'd just been murdered , " said Cynthia . " I think that 's a fairly good reason . And because ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the black velvet across her lap ? " because I told him once I wished I could kill him . But that was a long time ago . " Wade leaned nearer , and spoke earnestly to her . " Wo n't you tell me about it now ? Believe me , it 's got to come . " " He 's dead , " she said in a low , tired voice . " He ca n't hurt anybody any more . I think if the police knew how many people he had hurt  --  perhaps they would n't say killing him was such a crime . " " Do n't you think , " he urged , " that you might let the district attorney decide that ? The district attorney is a very fine man , Mrs. Fontenay . He has been my most intimate friend for a good many years . " Cynthia was looking down . " What do you want me to tell you ? " " All you know about Roger Parnell , " he answered . " I do n't know all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But I do know so much that I ca n't be very sorry he 's dead . " She stopped , and he did not interrupt her . After a moment she looked straight up at him . " I met him when I went to college in Chicago , " she said . " I was sixteen years old . I was what they used  | to call boy-crazy . I was forever slipping out for dates and dancing all night and cutting classes to sleep the next morning and making a general little idiot of myself , the way some girls do when they 're first away from home . Roger was a junior . He was good-looking and a beautiful dancer . I thought he was marvelous . My parents were wintering in the South . Roger and I were both invited to a house-party for the Christmas holidays . He asked me to drive up from college in his car . We stopped on the way and got married and spent the holidays at a hotel in Evanston . " He nodded , sympathetically . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they 're too young to be turned loose , and spend the rest of their lives being sorry for . " " It was just that . " Cynthia tied a knot in the corner of her damp little handkerchief . " Of course I thought then it was one of those grand romances I 'd read about . He told me not to say anything about it , and I did n't , because I knew how angry my parents would be . I planned to keep it a secret till I was eighteen or so , and then get married all over again  --  a big beautiful church wedding with bridesmaids and ushers and lilies and a table full of presents for guests to gasp at  --  oh , I was such a fool ! " For an instant it looked as if she would break down again . He was relieved when she steadied herself and went on . " It did n't take me very long to find it out , " she said . Then she stopped abruptly . " What do you mean ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could . " Money , " said Cynthia briefly . She looked back at him . " My parents were n't precisely rich , but father had made a lot of money  --  it was during the war , and prices were high  --  and I had everything I wanted . I knew Roger did n't have anything , and at first I thought it was very romantic to write home for money and give  | it to him . It got tiresome after awhile , but I might have gone on for a long time without realizing that that was why he had married me , if something had n't happened in the spring . Roger was asked to leave college because he was found to have been blackmailing the wife of one of the business men in town . It was pretty bad . " I stayed on at college , praying nobody would find out about us , until my father appeared one day and took me home . Roger had gone to him  --  father was back from Florida by that time  --  and had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was up to them to get him out of this mess . Father paid him to get out of the way and then had the marriage annulled because I was under age . " She smiled wanly . " I do n't suppose the rest of my biography is of any special interest to you . I told Captain Murphy the truth about the other two men I 'd married . They have n't anything to do with this . " " What about Parnell 's coming to New Orleans ? " Wade asked her . " Why was that ? " " I do n't know . I suppose because he 'd made friends with Fritz Valdon , and Valdon is so powerful here . When he found I was here he came and wanted to borrow some money . I told him I 'd let him have it if he 'd never tell anybody I 'd been married to him . It was with my capital that he started the Red Cat . " " Did you share the profits there ? " Cynthia hesitated . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of defiance , " That 's probably illegal and all that sort of thing , but one must do something ! Money has n't been easy to get in the past year or two . I 'm not immune from the depression . " " That 's all right , " he assured her . " I think the district attorney is going to be more interested in Parnell 's murder than anything else now . Is there anything more we ought to know ? " " I think maybe there is , " she said after a moment .  | " I 'm sure Roger was n't a member of Dis , because he asked me to get him in and I refused . I told Fritz Valdon I did n't want him in , and Fritz said he was sure he had n't a chance . That was just before Fritz and Roger split . Fritz told me later he could n't stand the things that were being said about controlled wheels at the Red Cat . Things seemed to be tightening around Roger . He asked me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost a lot of money in a private game and that she had promised the house manager to pay him off in installments . He had told Esther she could leave the money with me , and Roger asked me to give it to him instead of to the house manager . " " And you let her leave it with you ? " " Yes . It was a lot of money . She gave me eighteen thousand dollars in small payments , and last night she came to me with ten thousand more . Of course I know Esther can afford to lose that much , but all the same it seems a lot for a child like her to lose in a gambling game . Roger wanted to come to the Dis ball tonight and get the money , and I told him he could n't . I said he could send somebody else . When he said he knew no one who was a member of Dis , I violated a rule and told him Arnold Ghent was a member . I told him he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave the money ? " Wade began , and she finished , " ? to Parnell , thinking he was Arnold Ghent . He came up to me and slipped a typewritten note into my hand . It just said I 'm Arnold Ghent . Have you got a package for me to take to Parnell ? ' I told him I 'd pass it to him when the lights went out . " " And you did ? " " Yes . There was a lighted devil 's head in one corner , and by the glow from that I made out the number on his suit and passed him the money . " Cynthia smiled slowly . " Do n't you see the point I 'm making ? " she asked .  | Suddenly Wade glanced at the black wallet lying on the table . Their eyes met . " Why , yes , " said Cynthia . " I saw the policeman taking ten thousand dollars from Con Conroy . Why do n't you ask him where he got it ? " Wade nodded . " Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He considered a moment . " Do you really think Esther lost twenty-eight thousand dollars gambling at the Red Cat ? She does n't look like the sort of girl who 'd go there at all . " Cynthia drew a long breath . " I do n't know , Mr. Wade . All I can tell you is that after the ceremony , when Esther asked me if I had sent the money to Roger , she said I loathe myself , Cynthia , every time I do this . Thank God tonight . is the last time . ' About that time Lucy came and called me into the china-closet . " " And that 's all ? " She shook her head . " No , Mr. Wade . That 's not all , but you know the rest . Roger Parnell is dead . And I suppose , " she added bitterly , " that before long you 'll see to it that I wish I were . "  | CHAPTER THIRTEEN Murphy sat facing Con Conroy in a cubbyhole on the second floor of police headquarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a succession of cubbyholes used for similar purposes , with lights ingeniously arranged so that the policeman behind the desk sat in shadow , while the light blazed full upon the person facing him . But no blaze of light could be called revealing when it illumined the person of Fritz Valdon 's secretary . For the expression of Con Conroy , as usual , revealed precisely nothing . Wade , who occupied a chair near the door , within the shadow that blurred the features of Murphy , watched Conroy and the captain with interest tinged with a shade of involuntary amusement . His association with Murphy as the district attorney 's unofficial assistant in several crime cases had given him respect for the lumbering but rarely foolish processes of Murphy 's reasoning , but he had his doubts about the efficacy of Murphy 's methods when matched with the placid subtleties of Mr. Conroy . He waited . Con Conroy leaned back in the big oak chair and smiled . It was not a taunting smile . It was simply a pleasant , good-humored smile , the smile with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a drink . His cherubic face was serene , and his round china-blue eyes met Murphy 's with blank cheerfulness . " You 've no right to expect me to answer that question , Captain Murphy , " he said . He said it with the same gentle politeness with which he had agreed to come to police headquarters to talk things over . " Maybe you 're right , my boy . " Murphy was dangerously genial . " But unless you answer it here , I 'm going to push this and force your going to trial . " Conroy 's blue eyes did not shift , and his smile did not alter . " Meaning , " he said mildly , " that I 'm to take the fall . "  | Murphy nodded , poking the ashy end of his cigar at a burned match in the ash-tray . " Just that , Conroy . " Conroy 's chubby forefinger pushed back a vagrant lock of his blond hair . He gave a little sigh of resignation . " You 're going to feel very foolish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I suppose you 're used to that . " " I 'm used to being told that I 'll feel foolish , boy , " Murphy answered . He laughed , a low , appreciative chuckle . Conroy gave an expressive lift of his golden eyebrows , and got up . " Well , I 've got to be going . " His fingers tapped a long slow yawn . " It 's past my bedtime , " he explained with a glance at Wade . Murphy shook his head . There were determination and a suggestion of regret in his manner . " No , Con roy , ' he said , " do n't go yet . " He gave Conroy a bit of a smile . " You ca n't do it that way , " he added . " You 've got to come through . " His voice rose . " I 'm going all the way on this thing , and I do n't give a damn if it 's Valdon or yourself that 's hurt . Now answer me . Where did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dice game , " said Conroy . His voice was patient , almost sweet . He stood with one hand on the back of his chair , smiling at Wade . The fingers of his other hand smothered another yawn . Wade observed irrelevantly that there were dimples where the knuckles ought to be . " All right , then , " snapped Murphy . " So that 's your story . " He pressed a black buzzer on his desk . " We 'll see what we have to do with you in just a minute . " A night orderly came in , and Murphy motioned to him with a crook of his blunt forefinger . " Bring her in , " he ordered . As Murphy sat back , Wade stepped over to Conroy , who still stood leaning on the back of his chair . " This is bad medicine coming up , Conroy , " Wade advised in a low tone . " Murphy 'll be more decent about  | this thing if you 'll tell him beforehand where that money came from . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the next arrival . Conroy studied his broad back . " I do n't like him well enough to tell him , " he answered coolly . " What 's the matter ? " Conroy shrugged . " He 's likely to put a monkey wrench in the works if he gets half smart . " " Meaning ? " Wade was puzzled . " That what he does n't know may not hurt anybody . " Wade shook his head . " I 'm still in the dark . " Conroy tossed him a smile that had an odd suggestion of tantalizing friendliness , and just then Murphy turned around . The door had opened . Esther Morse came in . She wore a dark blue hat and a big coat of Persian lamb , and her face looked small and white above the great collar . As the orderly closed the door behind her she stood for an instant just across the threshold looking at Wade and Conroy and Murphy , with a look that was half pleading and half defiant . Murphy offered her a chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , and sat down . For a moment Murphy watched her without speaking . Esther waited quietly , one hand smoothing down the fur of the tiny muff she carried . Wade looked at her with sympathetic interest . In the flowing white costume she had worn at the Dis ball , with her hair loose on her shoulders and the wreath of poppies above her forehead , she had looked , not like Persephone , but like a child dressed up for a party . But now there was an odd suggestion of maturity about her , as though in putting on street clothes she had put on a new courage . She slipped her other hand out of her muff . threw back her coat and addressed Murphy in a clear , steady young voice .  | " What did you want to see me about , Captain Murphy ? " Murphy came directly to the point . " Miss Morse , what denomination were the bills making up the ten thousand dollars you paid Mrs. Fontenay tonight ? " Esther started . Her hands slipped inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremble . " Why  --  they ? " her voice steadied again . " Who told you I gave ten thousand dollars to Mrs. Fontenay ? " she asked . " We know about that , " Murphy told her stolidly . " What we want to know is , what denomination were the bills ? " Esther looked down . Wade could see a convulsive little rumpling of the muff , as though the hands inside it had clenched . " Ten one-thousand dollar bills , " she answered . " Now , Conroy ? " Murphy wheeled upon him ? " where did you get them ? " Conroy stood watching Esther , intently , as though his mind was busy with a problem of his own . He did not answer . " Where did you get that money , Conroy ? " Murphy repeated . " I beat a dice game , " said Conroy . He looked directly at Murphy . " A man 's dice game , " he said . " There were no women in it . " Murphy gave vent to something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever gets to be . " All right , " he jerked out . " Let it go at that . " He pressed the buzzer on his desk . The orderly came in . " Take this guy to the Ninth Precinct , " Murphy directed shortly . " Hold him as a dangerous and suspicious character . Do n't let any body get to him if you have to dig a hole to hide him in . " Esther bit her lip . One of her small gloved hands went up and twisted a point of her collar , She said nothing .  | Conroy smiled tolerantly . He picked up his hat and went toward the door . As he passed Esther 's chair he winked at her broadly . She frowned , as if she did not understand . " I had a nice little thingamajig all fixed up , Miss Morse , " Conroy said to her pleasantly , " and you made it look as if I were wrong . Now I know it 's right . " She smiled , a little puzzled smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murphy . " Have your little party , captain , " he added with smooth good-nature . " Maybe you do n't know it , but you 've done me a big favor by asking me here . I may do as much for you some day . " He followed the orderly , and his eyes fell on Wade , who was standing by the door . He paused a minute . " Come and see me sometime , ? lade , " he said distinctly , and as their eyes met Wade understood that the summons was real . " Fine , " he answered , smiling . " Tea is fourish , I sup-pose ? " " Fourish , " Conroy nodded . " That will be excellent . " Murphy had watched them without comment . " Have fun while you can , Conroy , " he advised with a grim smile . And then to the policeman the orderly had summoned , " Take him away , and do n't let them book him . " Conroy smiled back , but his smile was not grim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officer . " Let 's see what kind of a place I 'm to have for my Mardi Gras headquarters . " They went out , and Murphy sat down again behind his desk . He grinned contentedly at Wade , and Wade grinned back , wondering how a night at the Ninth was going to affect the placid Mr. Conroy . The Ninth Precinct station house was an old one , and a favorite place for stowing away recalcitrant suspects , who were charged , as Conroy had been , with being dangerous and suspicious characters  --  a charge better known as 1436 . Ordinance 1436 was the police loop-  | hole for men who could be proved to have committed no particular crime but who looked ready to commit one as soon as circumstances made it possible , or who the police felt sure had committed a crime but against whom nothing could be adduced as evidence . Local members of the halfworld called a night at the Ninth " taking the cure . " As a cure it was pretty effective , for unless one was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dripping , rat-ridden , unlighted depths of the old station cells caused one to think twice before entering upon any fresh transgressions ; and even the toughest of gansters had been known to confess with teary appeals for mercy after two days on sparse fare among the rats . " Think he 'll like it ? " Murphy asked Wade with a wink . Wade glanced meaningly at Esther , who was again looking down at her muff . " It 's pretty medieval , " he said smiling . " But it ought to make him talk . " " Well , ai n't that what we want ? " Murphy demanded . He returned his attention to Esther . " And now , young lady , I want the truth from you . What about that money ? " Esther sat up as if she had been struck . " I gave it to Mrs. Fontenay , " she said stiffly . " I do n't know how that man got it . " " What did you give it to Mrs , . Fontenay for ? " Murphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Morse , " said Murphy , and his manner was as persuasive as he could make it . " Wre do n't want to get you into any trouble undeserved . You play fair with us , and we 'll play fair with you . I mean it . But we 've got to have the truth . " Esther hesitated . She looked at Wade , as if taking courage from the fact that he was not in uniform . " I 'll tell you  --  all I can , " she said breathlessly . " I 've been  | giving it to him  --  to Mr. Parnell  --  for about four months . He promised me tonight would be the last time . He said he was leaving town tomorrow and was n't ever coming back . I brought the money to Cynthia . She said she would give it to him . " " Why were you paying Parnell ? " Murphy asked . Esther shook her head . Wade moved his chair a bit nearer hers . " Miss Morse , " he said quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do this . But before we can look for the murderer of Roger Parnell , we must have all the facts we can get about his life . We 're asking you for a statement that may involve personal embarrassment for you , but believe me , what you say here will be kept as confidential as it is possible to keep it . Wo n't you tell us ? " Esther 's dark eyes met his . " Mr. Wade , " she . said with a faint smile , " if this was something I could have asked the police to protect me from , do you suppose I 'd have paid money to that man ? " " But he is dead , " Wade urged her . " He ca n't hurt you now . " " No , Mr. Wade , he ca n't . " Her voice was low and steady . " But you can . " The quiet suggestion of tragedy in her answer made him wince . He wished it was possible for him to tell her how deeply his sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have liked to shield her from the terror she was accepting so bravely . He asked his next question as gently as he could . " Then it was blackmail ? " " Yes , " said Esther . Suddenly she leaned toward him , her hands stretched out to him in desperate appeal . " Please do n't let them know that ! " she cried . " He promised me he would tell Cynthia it was a gambling debt . I do n't think she believed it , but she pretended she did  --  it 's easier that way . " She twisted her fingers together as though the words were wrenched from her  | with dreadful pain . " I  --  I 've got a lot of pride , " she whispered , " in spite of the things I 've let happen to me . " Suddenly Wade remembered Dick  --  Dick 's thin , sensitive face , with its overlaid look of bitterness . He thought how like Esther 's that expression was . Impulsively he stood up and leaned over her chair , shutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How old are you , Esther ? " he asked gently . " Nineteen . " Wade set his jaw . This was difficult , but it had to come . He had not realized how difficult it was going to be till his mind began to form the question . He looked down at Esther , and saw her against the incongruous awfulness of her surroundings  --  a young girl fresh from school and coming-out parties , here in police headquarters at four o'clock in the morning , despairingly defending herself with the stern barricade of her innocence . He felt himself cruel , almost inhuman , to be the instrument that would strip her of her last defense . But he knew also that Murphy 's hands would be less tender than his . " Esther , " he said , and did not realize till after he had spoken that he was calling her by her first name , " you 've got to believe me when I say this . We do n't want to create a new tragedy for you . You are very young , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinations of a man like Roger Parnell . We know that he might drive you to absolute desperation . If you should tell us now that he had been blackmailing you till you could endure it no longer , and that you killed him , I 'm not even sure the district attorney would make you stand trial . But before we can stop , we 've got to know why . " He paused . Esther was listening with a heartbreaking intensity that almost unnerved him . She said nothing . Wade went on . " In asking you why you were pay-  | ing blackmail to Parnell , Captain Murphy is only doing what you and the rest of the decent people in town pay him to do . So do n't think I 'm being too cruel when I ask you  --  was Parnell blackmailing you because of something he knew about Dick Barron ? " Esther started up . Her hands gripped the arms of her chair . She stared at him from eyes that were dilated with anger and terror . For an instant he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out an arm to catch her if she fell ; but after the shock of the first instant was over she slowly stood up , and faced him with a challenge that dared him to go further . " I do n't know what you hoped I would say to that , " she exclaimed scornfully , " but I 'm not going to say it , because I sha n't answer . " She turned away . " Are you going to arrest me ? " Murphy pushed back his chair and came quickly around the desk to her . " Of course not , macushla . You can go home now . " " Oh  --  thank you ! " she exclaimed . " Thank you so much . " " Did someone come with you ? " Wade asked hastily . " You wo n't have to go alone ? " She looked up at him with an odd expression . " I came alone , " she answered . " You do n't think I want Uncle Claude to know I 'm being dragged down to police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'll send one of the boys along to take care of you , " Murphy offered . " Just come with me . " He went out with her . Wade sat down wearily . He was glad that much , at least , was over .  | CHAPTER FOURTEEN " Mark Oliver shot . " Wade settled back against the leather seat of his taxi and tried to resign himself to the slow maneuvering of the driver . This was a story  --  Mark Oliver , the hermit toy manufacturer , shot in his own house after leaving the Dis ball . Wade did not know how serious the wound was , but as the car backed and turned on the uneven road in front of the Ninth Precinct station , he surmised that a word or two from him now would make Oliver amply able to talk . He looked over his shoulder at the gloomy stationhouse , black against the pink dawn , where he had gone to visit Con Conroy shortly before the news of Oliver 's injury had reached the police . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , and had shown Conroy no courtesy because his clothes were brushed and his English good , but had summarily tucked him away in a pitch-black cell with damp crawling walls . Conroy had greeted Wade with his habitual cheerfulness and had suggested that their talk be brief , " because , " be had said , " I 'm going to fool that red-necked soandso Murphy . " Wade had looked around the cell by the light of a candle he had been permitted to bring with him . He grinned at Conroy with undisguised admiration . " Sit down ? " that gentleman offered , indicating the hammock swung along one side of the wall , which was the cell 's only furniture . Wade took a glance at the walls and shook his head . " No thanks . " Conroy laughed placidly . " I suppose you 're right . That is , for yourself . As for me , I 'll sit down . You see , I 'm going to sleep here . " Wade laughed in spite of himself . " I doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Mr. Conroy , " I 've slept in a great many places . Not of my own accord , as I 'm not here of my own accord . But the point is , I 've slept . And I shall sleep here . Also , as I observed before , it is past my bedtime . Therefore your visit must be brief . " " I 'll go with pleasure , " Wade assured him . " But what did you want to tell me ? " Conroy got up and came a step closer . His ironically meek blue eyes studied Wade . " I only wanted to suggest , in my humble way , " he said , " that it might be wise for you to pay some attention to Oliver . The kind old gentleman who makes the toys . " " Oliver ? " Wade called up a mental picture of Oliver 's irascible but apparently harmless manner . " Why ? " ? " Because , " said Conroy smiling , " a little bird is whispering to you that before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wade started to exclaim , but Conroy shook his head . " Good night , " he waved smiling . " I shall see you again . Good night . " Wade saw that his dismissal was final . He set the candle down on the floor . " All right , and thank you . I 'm going to leave the candle . You are n't supposed to have it , but we 'll say I forgot and left it here . " " Thank you , " said Conroy politely . " By the way , nothing of this to Murphy . He might mess up something that 's on the way . " Wade agreed and went out . His heart was thumping . Oliver  --  of all men . He wondered how far the enigmatical Mr. Conroy could be trusted . At any rate , he planned to go out to Metairie and interrupt Mr. Oliver 's slumbers . He had followed the doorman who had come with him to Conroy 's cell block and they had gone up to the sergeant 's room . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going down to get you , Mr. Wade , " he had exclaimed . " Look what came over the teletype . " Wade snatched the paper from his hand and read the report . " Mark Oliver , 7915 Metairie Lane , shot and wounded at about 4:20 this a. m . All-station message to pick up any suspicious characters , in Metairie neighborhood especially , for questioning . " Wade grinned to himself now as the cab bounced along the side streets . Wiggins , he knew , had gone to sleep on a table in the photographers ' room at the Creole office , and Murphy was already at home in bed . As the cab bore him along Tulane Avenue toward the emergency entrance of Charity Hospital he debated whether to call Wiggins at once or to let the picture wait till later . But he rather enjoyed the prospect of razzing his little cameraman for being asleep while things were going on , so ordering the cab to wait he swung through the side entrance of the hospital . Passing an orderly in the ambulance driveway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit and a broad white coif was talking to the registry clerk , and a brace of patrolmen from headquarters waited in the anteroom . Wade touched his hat . " Hello , Sister Lucille . How 's everything ? " Sister Lucille started and then smiled . " Oh , Mr. Wade . We have n't had you here in a long time . What are you doing up so early in the morning ? " " Usual thing . Fellow named Oliver this time . Shot . Where is he ? " " Oh , and sure I thought that would be the one ! " Sister Lucille laughed . " He 's out by the door , talking to a friend of yours . Not badly hurt . " Just then a bright , bright light flashed on and off , and Wade heard the scrape of shoes on concrete and the soothing voice of Wiggins . " ' Stoo bad for a fact , Mr. Oliver , but you 're plenty lucky . "  |  | Wade grinned and hurried outside . By the door he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Wiggins happily putting up his plates . Wiggins looked up with surprise . " Hi , big boy , where you been ? You sure were a time getting here . Pictures all made . You know Mr. Oliver  --  well , the bogey man tried to get him with a roscoe and he wound up here seein ' the birdie . " Oliver was wiping his watery eyes and replacing his thick-lensed glasses . He smiled weakly . " Yes , Mr. Wade , a close call it was , a mighty close call . " Wade grinningly acquiesced Wiggins ' victory and spoke to Oliver . " That so ? It 's too bad . Hurt much ? " Oliver stepped under the doorway light and pointed to the bandage running from the back of his neck up the crown of his head . " Just nicked me , " he said , in what was meant to be an offhand manner , " just nicked me . A few inches more , and I suppose it would have been all over . But as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wiggins , on his knees by his camera , rattled off details . " Got it in the neck , " he began , slipping in a plate . " The slug took an upward course and just about creased him . No concussion , slight contusion marking path of bullet . Report and treatment by Dr. Finch . How 's that , pal ? " " Fine . Where 's Murphy ? " " He ripped his way outa his nightshirt and I guess he 'll be along in a minute . The flatfoots said we 'd better wait for him . " He looked up at Oliver . " You know , the cops say Murphy thought at first you were killed . " " It was close , young man . " Oliver was mopping his brow and dabbing at his eyes . " Very close . " " Sure , but they tell me you put up a great fight . " Wiggins scrambled to his feet and turned to Wade . " Our friend here , he dug out a gun from under his pillow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That takes tonic ? " he turned an approving eye on Oliver ? " but ifs too bad you did n't have your glasses on . You mighta got some place with all that blooieblooie . " Oliver cleared his throat . " I 'm afraid I only broke a window or two . I  --  well , I must admit I was quite nervous . " " Yeah , sure  --  who would n't be ? " Wiggins agreed knowingly . " You there in the middle of the room pumping that roscoe of yours and the back of your head playing Niagara Falls with claret . Say ? " he looked Oliver over with fresh approbation ? " if it hadda been me , I'da stayed right on the floor after the first brodie . " Oliver gave a cackling little laugh . Wade said nothing . He had watched Oliver thoughtfully , as the nervous little man kept mopping his forehead and pushing back his glasses to dab at his red-rimmed eyes , a perfect picture of a bashful man ill at ease because circumstances had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming down the ambulance drive . " What 's all this ? " Murphy demanded energetically . " How d' you feel , Mr. Oliver ? " " All right , captain , all right , quite all right , " Oliver assured him . " Just a bit  --  er  --  shaken up , of course . Shall we  --  shall we go indoors ? " " Sure . " Murphy pushed back the door . He was as brisk as though being grabbed out of bed after an hour 's nap was part of his health program . Swinging across the threshold he beckoned to Sister Lucille . " Bring this gentleman a bit of brandy , sister , if you 'll be so good . And let us use one of your offices . " The good sister smiled . " You can go in here , captain . " She led them into an office on the side of the emergency corridor , and they sat down by the white table . Murphy pushed aside several rolls of gauze and got to business .  | " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Oliver cleared his throat and wiped his eyes . " It was all quite unexpected , captain , " he started . " Sure , sure . " Murphy glanced up as Sister Lucille came in with a bottle of brandy . " Thanks , sister . I hope we wo n't trouble you again . Here , Mr. Oliver . " He poured Oliver a drink , and Wiggins reached for the bottle . He made a gesture to Wade , who shook his head , and Wiggins tilted the bottle back for a big swallow . " Hey , " roared Murphy , " that 's for the sick . " Wiggins grinned . " Boy , but you 're a great doctor , Murph . Nobody but you and me knows how sick I am . " Murphy grinned back , in spite of himself . Then turning to Oliver , " You feeling better now ? " " Quite all right , captain . " " Then tell us what happened . " Out came the handkerchief and up went the glasses . Wiggings made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ants from this ape , " he whispered to Wade . " After you told us we might leave Mrs. Fontenay 's house , " Oliver had started , " I got a cab and drove to Metairie . " " Direct ? " " Well , no . There were several of us in the cab , and we stopped at Mr. Valdon 's house to have a drink with him . I got to my house . " He stopped and looked around and coughed . " I 'm afraid I 'm not telling this very well . " He cleared his throat , wiped his forehead and fitted his glasses again . " Perhaps I had better begin over . " Wiggins sighed . Wade and Murphy waited attentively . " After you released us , we all telephoned for taxicabs and went down to the front gate . Mr. Valdon invited us all to stop at his house for a drink . Mr. Ghent said he would not be able to come , and Mrs. Hildreth also refused . When the cabs came , she and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her home . Miss Morse ? 1 believe it was Miss Morse  --  yes , I am sure  --  Miss Morse also refused , and took a taxicab alone . She declined our offers to escort her , though we objected to a young lady 's going home alone at that hour . So the other two of us went off . Mr. Valdon and I. " " What about Dick Barron ? " asked Wade . " 0 yes , Mr. Barron . He was with us . I forgot to mention him . " Oliver paused . Wiggins took out his own handkerchief and wiped his forehead . Oliver rubbed his handkerchief between his hands and cleared his throat . " Yes , Mr. Barron went with us . But he asked to be let out at Canal Street . Mr. Valdon and I went on to Mr. Valdon 's house . " Wiggins reached over and lifted the brandy bottle . He threw an expressive glance at Wade , and took a drink . Oliver coughed . " I  --  I am afraid I am extremely nervous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statement in the morning ? " " Are you going to stay here all day ? " Murphy asked . " In the hospital , I mean ? " Oliver shook his bandaged head . " I 'd rather not . I 'm not really hurt  --  just distraught . A little weak , perhaps . " " Then you 'll have to make the statement now , " Murphy ruled . Wiggins shoved the bottle toward him . " Take another shot of Murphy 's Famous Remedy , " he advised . " You might feel better . " Oliver took a drink eagerly . " Very well , then I 'll be as brief as I can . I must have left Mr. Valdon 's house about three-thirty . I went home . I went immediately to my room to prepare for bed . The running water in the bathroom might have made it impossible for me to hear anyone enter the room ; at any rate , I walked into the bedroom from the bath drying my face . My glasses were on a bathroom shelf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was fully dressed . " said Oliver , " except that I had taken off my Dis robe and my shirt . When I reached the side of the bed I stooped to feel for my slippers , which I knew were usually placed there . " He paused and explained parenthetically , " My eyesight is very bad , you know . Without my glasses I am seriously handicapped . As I bent over I heard a report behind me and felt a stab and a burning sensation at the back of my head . The force was not great , but I fell to the floor . " He brought out the ubiquitous handkerchief . " The bed was between me and my attacker , " he went on . " I could not see him . I slid my hand under the pillow for a gun . I always sleep with a gun there  --  the house is some distance from any other house , you know , and I live alone . " He took another drink of brandy . " On the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a balcony . They were closed . I fired in the direction of the windows , and I heard sounds as if someone were running along the tiled porch . I hurried out , and could see a figure , very dimly . I emptied my gun at it . " Then a neighbor came . I had tried to stop the flow of blood with a towel . My neighbor , Mr. Dwight , got 11 my car and drove me here . We told a policeman about the affair when we got into town . Mr. Dwight went back to the house with him and two other officers . " Out came the handkerchief and up popped Wiggins with the proffered bottle . Oliver made use of both . " You could n't see this fellow ? " Murphy asked . " No . That is , I could make out some sort of moving outline in the dark . My eyesight , you know . " " Could it have been a woman ? " suggested Wade . " Possibly . My impression is that the figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not swear to it . "  | Wade reached for his hat , which he had hung on the back of his chair . " Well , you 're to be congratulated on a narrow escape , Mr. Oliver . If it had n't been for the slippers , I 'm afraid you 'd have been done for . " As Oliver nodded and mopped his brow Wade gave Murphy a significant wink . " Captain , " he said , " if Mr. Oliver wants to go home now , I 'll take him . " Murphy quickly smoothed off his look of surprise . " All right , " he agreed , " that 's good of you . What about keeping a man at the house for the rest of the night , Mr. Oliver ? " " Just as you say , certainly , captain . But I might just as well be alone . " He smiled wanly . " You see , Captain Murphy , if I 'd had my glasses on I 'd not have missed . Pistol shooting is rather a hobby of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wiggins yanked at Wade 's coat-tails and jerked him back . " Hey , " he whispered , " I see you give Murph the office . What 's up ? " Wade lifted a cautioning finger . " I 'll meet you at the office about noon , Wiggins , " he said clearly . " I 'm going home right after I deliver Mr. Oliver , and catch some sleep . " At the door , Murphy was asking Oliver if he had any idea why anyone should want to kill him . Oliver was emphatic in his answer that as far as he knew , he had no enemies . " I live a rather retired life , " he explained with his apologetic smile , " and know few people intimately . " Murphy was about to ask more , but Wade nudged him . So Murphy contented himself with telling Oliver the he hoped they 'd find the man , and Oliver explained hesitatingly that it might have been a housebreaker who had been forced to shoot because he thought he had been seen through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cab door and waved an optimistic good night . Wade gave the driver Oliver 's address and settled  | back . He offered Oliver a cigarette and lit one of his own . With a semi-gymnastic contortion , his foot slid the glass partition closed between the rear seat and the driver . " Now , Oliver , " he said , " who tried to shoot you ? " Oliver shook his head . " I wish I knew Mr. Wade . " His voice was as vindictive as the voice of a harrassed and nervous gentleman can be . " We 'd go to see him . " Wade laughed . " Not we , " he said . " I 've got too much to live for . " Oliver did not answer . Wade spoke decisively . " Oliver , I suppose you know my setup on this case . What I know I print in the paper . Usually , that is . Not always . " " Yes , I understand . You 're a reporter . " " Right , and tonight I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to waste a lot of time beating around the bush with you . " Oliver gave him a surprised look and started to speak . " Do n't bother to interrupt , " Wade said . He paused for a second , watching Oliver 's weak eyes behind the heavy glasses . " Where did you get that ten thousand dollars , Oliver ? " he asked . " And what did you do with it ? " Oliver gave a sigh , a deep sigh that sounded like an expression of relief . " Young man , " he said solemnly , " I 'm glad you asked me that . I did n't know what to say about it . That money  --  was it ten thousand dollars ? " " Where did you get it ? " asked Wade . " I did n't know what to say about it , " murmured Oliver . " I did n't feel  --  er  --  free to talk , and I did n't know what to do . " " Where did you get it ? " asked Wade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The room was dark . It was dark , that is , except for an illumined devil 's head in one corner . A large head . I designed it myself . I suppose this has been described to you . " " Yes . What about the money ? " " Not so fast , no so fast , " Oliver urged smilingly . " I shall come to that . It was soon after the lights were turned off . The room was in almost complete blackness . I heard a voice say 147 . ' In a whisper , you understand . " " Your number is 147 ? " " Yes . You must remember this was before the tellers had taken their places . Just at the beginning of the ceremony . " Wade nodded . " When I heard this whisper , I was right alongside of the person who had whispered , and I turned around . I felt a touch on my arm . This person slipped something into my hand . A black leather wallet . The same voice whispered , Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " You knew it was n't meant for you ? " " No  --  no indeed . " Oliver edged forward and leaned closer to Wade , his thin forefinger marking his words . " You understand , Mr. Parnell had lost eleven thousand dollars to me in a private backgammon game one night last month , and had not paid off . I called him on it just last Saturday night . I thought this was that money . " He blinked behind his thick glasses . " I thought perhaps Parnell was a member of Dis and had taken this ? well , er  --  spectacular method of paying off . I did not know how he knew my number , but I had no time to inquire , for the instant the wallet was passed to me the person passing it stepped back and in the dark could not be identified among the others . Then , after the ceremony ? " He stopped and mopped his forehead . " This , Mr. Wade , is what makes it extremely strange . Incomprehensible , in fact . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still dark . I felt two hands on my shoulders , and a voice said Come along and get the thrill of your life , ' and the speaker pushed me playfully , but firmly , ahead of him . "  |  | " You are sure it was a man ? " " Well  --  I think so . The voice struck me as masculine , though it was a whisper . I went with him , unresisting . I thought it was all part of the game . He headed me for the cloakroom alongside of the ballroom entrance . " " Was it dark in the cloakroom ? " " No . The figure marched me to the wall , and said , still jokingly , Stand there and wait for the big moment . ' I stood still  --  all in the spirit of fun , you know . In the spirit of fun , yes . The next thing that happened ? " Oliver 's voice rose , and his forehead was damp again ? " was that I felt the tip of a gun under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course  --  well , I was unarmed , so of course I gave up the wallet . I thought  --  yes , it is perhaps not sporting to say this of a dead man  --  I thought it was Parnell , getting his money back . I was angry , but quite helpless , you understand . Just as I handed over the money the voice told me to turn around with my face to the wall . I obeyed . I heard the door open and close and when I finally turned around again I was alone . " Wade considered a moment . " You did not recognize the voice at all ? " he asked at length . " 0 , no . " Oliver shook his head ruefully . " Each mask has a muffled mouthpiece , you know , to disguise the voice . It 's very effective , " he added , clearing his throat ? " you see , I designed it myself . " Wade smiled . " What about the number of the man in the cloakroom ? Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You see , he was behind me at first , then when he turned his back to go out I was facing the wall . When I got out and the lights were on in the ballroom , it was impossible to say which he was . About that time the photographer came up to take the picture , and the festivities continued until Captain Murphy came in and told us Parnell had been murdered . " END OF PART ONE " " M " OlMEMIMEMEMO.  | SHROVE TUESDAY Mardi Gras . The town was gold and shining . The streets rocked with music and quivered with laughter ; banners floated from skyscraper towers and long silken festoons looped the windows , swirling the buildings in purple and green and gold , the crown colors of Rex , King of Carnival . Bands played on the corners and children danced in the street , while the sidewalks threw back echoes of half a million voices , for it was Mardi Gras , the golden holiday of New Orleans , when the town goes wild . Roger Parnell 's body lay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found who mourned him . At noon Rex was going to ride through the shouting streets at the head of his parade , and at the steps of the City Hall the Mayor would give him the keys of the city , and Rex would lead his court on till his throne float stopped under the balcony where the Queen of Carnival and her maids waited for him , while the band played " If Ever I Cease to Love . " The town was thrilled and waiting . Maskers asked one another about the murder , and some of them carried papers in their hands , but they spoke of it as of something that could wait till tomorrow for argument . Downtown in the den of Dis the sun fell through the skylight on strange floats that would move through the French Quarter after the parade of Rex was over . They were no less magnificent than the floats of the merry Carnival parades , and they had required no less artistry in their design , but they were all strange and faintly sinister , making a pageant not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , discomforting . The parade of Dis would be a spectacle that one would turn from with a sense of discord , an instinctive feeling that this , wildly beautiful as it was , was an intrusion alien to Mardi Gras . One would re-  | member , watching the Dis parade , that a man had been murdered last night while these maskers danced , and one would remember that the name of their order was the syllable that began words of lost illusions . But the Dis parade would not be on the street till afternoon . It was Mardi Gras morning , and the town thrilled to the coming of the king .  | CHAPTER FIFTEEN He sat negligently on the curbstone at the corner of Royal and Canal Streets , a circus clown whose white pantaloons were spotted with red rings as big as apples , and whose face had taken refuge behind a chalk-white mask split from ear to ear in a superhumanly jovial grin . He was not a very big clown , though the peaked dunce-cap that crowned his head added a deceptive tallness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which his small person was obviously inadequate to support . He had occupied the curbstone for several minutes , oblivious of the crazily-garbed creatures who passed him or who stopped to gaze and trip a step to the rhythm of the banjo that he was strumming . A tiny Indian brave , aged about six , gave the clown a nudge with his toe . " Sing a song , Mister Moddygraw ? " The clown turned his unbelievable grin . " Sure , Big Chief . I ai n't here for nothing else . Listen . " He thrummed brightly . " Nigger be a nigger do n't care what you do , Tie a bow of ribbon right around his shoe ? " " Hello , Mister Mardigras ! " It was a high , clear voice , a voice that broke through the crowd like a shaft of light , and the clown 's fingers crossed the banjo strings in a hurried final chord as his song stopped and he scrambled to his feet . The little Indian brave gaped at such rudeness , but the clown 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all he got , and he turned off toward Canal Street with a disappointed shrug . But the clown had forgotten the brave 's existence , for he had scrambled up to meet a black-and-white Pierrette whose tilted headdress failed to hide the flash of her red hair . He tucked his banjo under one arm and linked the other with hers , and they moved off down Royal Street .  | " Been waiting long ? " she asked . " Just about ten minutes . I was having fun . " " Too bad you had to stop playing the banjo for that kid . " " Oh , I ca n't be playing a banjo all day anyway . I got too many things to do . " He drew her close to the plate glass window of a shop . " What 'd you want to see me about ? " She hesitated . Under her black domino he could see her bite her lip thoughtfully . " Do n't let her know , Tony . " " I sure wo n't . How is she this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . It 's only about eight-thirty . She does n't know I 'm out . I hope you did n't mind getting all dressed up like this , but I did n't want anybody to recognize us talking . She might be mad if she heard ? she got pretty drunk after you left last night . " " Say , Lucy , I knew we ought n't to left you by yourself . ' Was she hard to manage ? " She shook her head , and the early sunshine threw golden flakes on her hair . " No , and there were plenty of cops at the gate if she had been . Most of the time she 's all right when she 's drunk . But of course , last night  --  she told me Murphy had said awful things to her . " " Listen ? " his voice was very low behind his grinning mask ? " what 's the chances that she ? " " Hus ! " She glanced fearfully at the crowd shoving past them . " I  --  I just do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I do n't know . I know she was n't drunk before you came  --  you remember she was n't a bit drunk when you took the picture  --  and she had been in a perfectly grand humor all evening . " Lucy twisted the big black pompon at her belt . " The only time she seemed to be bothered at all was when she told me to look out for Mr. Ghent  --  number 47 , you know , the one that turned out to be Mr. Parnell  --  and I did think she was sort of worried then . "  | " You know , " he ventured , " I sort of think Ghent might be the baby we 're after . He might have got out of his apartment after Parnell tied him up . " Lucy 's slipper traced a line in the pavement . " But what would he do it for ? " " He mighta had a reason . Did he know Cynthia had been married to Parnell ? " " I do n't know . But it 's kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husbands . " He chuckled . " Say , does she know you know about Parnell ? " " I do n't think so . The day she burned all that stuff , I cleaned out the fireplace before she woke up , and she probably does n't remember what she was talking about . She was awfully tight . " " Moddygraw doll-babies , lady ? Nice Moddygraw doll babies  --  buy one for the lady , mister  --  Moddygraw babies , ten cents . " " Sure , I 'll buy a doll-baby . " Wiggins dipped into his pantaloons for a dime and made a selection from the proffered tray of tiny naughty dollies . " Look , Lucy ? you pull the string and her skirt kites up in the back . " " That 's not nice . You ought to be ashamed of yourself . " " Oh , but it 's cute  --  do n't you see ? You pull the string ? " " Quit showing me that trash . You 're a nuisance . Here I run the risk of getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder ? " " Well , I got to have my lighter moments , ai n't I ? Take this nice baby and come over here to the wagon and I 'll get you some cotton candy . " She yielded , protesting , but when Wiggins had led her to the pushcart at the corner and provided her with a great swirl of pink sugar fluff as large as her head , delectably mounted on the end of a stick , Lucy became insistent . " Look here , Tony , I 've got to go . She 'll be  | waking up and wanting ice water and tomato juice , and suppose I 'm not there to give them to her ? " " Why do n't you give me a break ? She wo n't be up for another couple of hours . " " But I 've got lots to do , and I am giving you a break . " She drew him back against the side of the shop . " I brought you something I found , " she whispered . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yeah ? " Wiggins galvanized with eagerness . " Gee , Lucy , you 're smart . Evidence ? " She nodded . Her blue eyes peered anxiously through the slits in the domino , but the early revelers of Mardi Gras were noticing them not at all . " Last night , " she whispered , " after you had gone , I went around seeing that all the windows were shut . I walked along the side balcony , because Murphy had locked up the china-closet and I would'nt have gone in there anyway . The balcony goes all the way around the house , you know , and I had taken a flashlight , because I was nervous . Outside the window of the . china-closet ? not right outside , but four or five feet away , on the balcony floor  --  I picked up this . " She reached inside her Pierrette costume and brought forth a little paper packet . Wiggins watched her breathlessly as she opened it , showing him a thin red silk cord , about eleven inches long . He peered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cord was the same dull scarlet as the Dis robes , but several inches of it had been stained almost black . He touched it , and the stained part was stiff . " Lord , " he whispered , " that 's probably blood , Lucy . " She started . " Do n't let anybody hear you . I think it 's blood too , because it 's the same color as that spot on his robe . It just shows that for some reason whoever killed him threw it out there  --  or dropped it by accident , or something , because  --  well , I do n't know why , but I thought I ought to give it to you . " Wiggins gazed at her with an admiration that was  | not wholly caused by her lithe little figure and her glistening hair . " You sure are a smart girl , Lucy . I 'll take it to headquarters . They can put it under a microscope or something and prove it 's blood , you know . Here ? " he produced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you write on the paper where you found it and when , and sign your name . " " I wo n't get in any trouble , will I ? " " Lord , no . I would n't let ' em hurt you , honey . They 'll be so pleased they 'll send you a bunch of flowers . " " Then I would be in a mess , " she chuckled as she signed her name on the scrap of paper that concealed the red thread . " If I started getting flowers from police headquarters . " She gave him the packet . " I 've got to go now , honest . You 'll be down taking pictures of the Dis parade ? " " Sure . There 's a platform already built for photographers . I 'll be on it . " " I 'll look for you . So long . " Wiggins watched her twinkling ankles till she was lost in the crowd . He turned around briskly and made his way back to the office of the Creole . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep betwen leaving the hospital and waking to answer Lucy 's telephoned request to don a costume and meet her on the street ; but Wiggins was too busy now to be bothered with remembering his weariness . He raced upstairs , took refuge in the lavatory to change his costume for his ordinary clothes , and hurried down to the city room to make sure there was no imperative assignment that would prevent his running over to police headquarters with the red yarn before it was time to photograph the Res parade . But as he entered the city room he encountered Wade , who was standing near the door talking hard and fast to another reporter . Wiggins sidled up to them . " Hi , pops ! Where 's the fire ? " Wade wheeled and looked down upon him with re-  | lief . " So here you are , thank the Lord . Where 've you been ? " " Out , " said Mr. Wiggins with dignity . " I been busy , see ? " Wade sighed . " Well , we 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go after you left the hospital ? " " Back here to that downy oak couch that some fools call a table . Did I play shut-eve ! " " So did I , damn it . Know what Chief Donahue did at four o'clock this morning ? " " Whew ! " Wiggins fairly pranced with delight . " Do n't tell me he pulled a murder down at headquarters . " " Worse than that , " Wade retorted glumly . " He thought he 'd pull a fast one while all the reporters were busy on the Dis murder ? " " And what did he do ? " " He raided the Red Cat . Got evidence enough to send twenty people to jail . Found papers proving Roger Parnell did own the joint ? " " Lord ! " Wiggins vociferated with resentful fury . " That kind of break for the evening papers  --  and after all the morning papers have done for him ? " " Sure , but wait till I tell you what kind of break he gave them . The place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in town . And dice that will hit and miss or do pretty nearly anything but give the customers an even chance . " " Whoops ! " said Wiggins . " What was Donahue 's idea ? " " I do n't know . But you and I 'd better get busy . " " Okay . We going out there ? We 'll miss the parades ? that 'll be ? " " No , we are n't going there . O'Malley 's already gone , with Charlie to get the pictures . You and I are going up to police headquarters . The district attorney is back in town , and Ross Hildreth is waiting to be questioned now . You 'll have to get a picture of him . "  | " Sure . Wait till I get some plates . " Wiggins had started off , but Wade strode after him and stopped him at the door . " Wait a minute , " he added in a guarded tone . " This is graveyard . They cracked Parnell 's strongbox and it was lousy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the d. a. ' s office . Hurry up .  | CHAPTER SIXTEEN Dan Farrell , district attorney of Orleans Parish , was in a state of exasperation . His desk was piled with police statements he had barely had time to glance at , and more were pouring in from the battery of stenographers who were typewriting angrily and badly in their indigation at being called to work on Mardi Gras morning . Weary policemen had talked and talked ; avid reporters had stormed his sanctum since sunrise ; witnesses had demandingly answered by telephone that they were not leaving town , and would tell him anything , if he 'd only wait till the Dis parade was over ; and the general sentiment of the town , which needed no explanation to Farrell , was that while a murder investigation was a necessary detail , the city administration would have reason to fear next election day if it tried to interfere with Mardi Gras . So Farrell had concluded that he might as well yield to spoken and unspoken tradition and let the Dis parade go on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murphy , " not one member of Dis has tried to get away . We 've checked them all . And we have n't got far enough along to hold anybody . " " Only , " said Murphy with stolid conviction , " Con Conroy . " Farrell sighed . " Conroy 's going to be sprung in a few minutes . Valdon 's got a writ . " Before Murphy could swear properly at whoever it was that had let Valdon know the whereabouts of his secretary there was a knock , and a clerk put in her head . " Mr. Wade and Mr. Wiggins of the Creole , " she announced . " Bring them in , " Farrell said with involuntary enthusiasm , and as the door opened again to admit Wade 's long languid figure and Wiggins hopping like a rabbit alongside of him , Farrell stood up with the first sug-  | gestion of pleasantness he had manifested that morning . " Howdy , Farrell , " Wiggins greeted him . " Lord , boys , but I 'm glad to see you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's been going on . " Wade slid his long self into a chair and faced Farrell across the desk . " I wish I knew . Murder . Knife and no fingerprints . A lot of poisonous personalities for suspects . What have you been doing ? " " Reading reports since seven o'clock . " Farrell grimaced . " Yeah ? " Wiggins commented . " What about the Red Cat raid ? " " I 'll come to that in a minute . I understand Donahue and his men did a riot act and they found among other things that the roulette wheels could be controlled . " " And that the late Mr. Parnell was the big squeeze , " chirped Wiggins from his seat on a window-sill . Farrell nodded . " What about the queer money they found ? " Wade inquired . Farrell considered an instant . " They did n't find very , much at the Red Cat . It looks as if the Red Cat had been gypped by somebody who put a little queer money into play . Parnell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtfully scratched his chin . He looked at Wiggins and Farrell and Murphy in turn , saying nothing . Murphy swore softly under his breath . Farrell touched a button on his desk and the clerk looked in . " Bring in Hildreth , " he ordered . " Tell the reporters they can come in and hear what he has to say but that they 're to keep quiet while I talk to him . And bring your notebook . " The girl nodded . A moment later she ushered in Ross Hildreth , who was followed by reporters from the other papers . The newspapermen waved silent greetings to Murphy and Farrell and placed themselves around the wall , waiting ; Hildreth stood uncertainly  | by the chair Wade had vacated , looking at his surroundings with the baffled air of a man who has waked up to find himself sleep-walking downtown in his pajamas . The district attorney was gravely polite . " Mr. Hildreth ? I 'm Dan Farrell . Have a chair . " Hildreth sat down . He was tall and fair , and handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first descriptive adjective that occurred to Wade on observing him was intense . His eyes were deep-set , and his hands , long and restless , were the hands of a man who has an insatiable desire for new experiences , and one felt that though he had been many places and known many sorts of people he was not and never would be satisfied , but must forever be seeking new towns and stripping new personalities , giving an extravagant response to every fresh stimulus . He was both fascinating and annoying , and as he sat down he regarded the district attorney with ill-concealed impatience . " You 're the district attorney ? Good . I do n't know a damn thing about this business of last night . I was in Baton Rouge . " He spoke rapidly , like a man hurrying to get done with a disagreeable job , and Farrell observed his somewhat uneasy glance at the clerk 's fleet pencil . " I 've been told that you were in Baton Rouge , Mr. Hildreth . Just a minute . " Farrell glanced up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was waiting by the door . " This is Patrolman Dallison of Baton Rouge , " he introduced . " Dallison drove down early this morning with Mr. Hildreth and came here with him . Tell us where you found Mr. Hildreth , Dallison . " Dallison took a step further into the room . " In the Heidelberg Hotel , Mr. Farrell . In his room . " " You went there in answer to a wire from New Orleans , I think ? " " Yes , sir . Me , I was at headquarters when we got the wire from here . It said a fellow named Hildreth was  | wanted in connection with a killing in New Orleans ? " " Really , this ? " Hildreth interrupted , but Farrell politely silenced him . " This is purely routine , Mr. Hildreth . Go , on , Dallison . What time did you get the wire ? " " About three o'clock , Mr. Farrell . So we called up the Heidelberg Hotel , and the night clerk said a fellow named Hildreth from New Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them it was police headquarters and had them ring up his room , but the phone did n't answer ? " " That was because ? " " We 'll listen to you in a minute , Hildreth . Go on , Dallison . " " So I went on up to the hotel and went up to his room and the door was locked , but I knocked and knocked and finally this gentleman opened the door with a bathrobe on over his pajamas and wanted to know what the hell I was doing waking him up in the middle of the night , then I guess he noticed I had on . a uniform and he looked sort of scared and asked me what I wanted , and I told him to get dressed and come on to New Orleans with me , on account of he was wanted down there . So he did n't seem like he wanted to come , but I said there had been a killing , and he started to get dressed and asked me a lot of questions which I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orleans had n't given a lot of details , but he said his car was parked down on a side street by the hotel , and we used it to drive here in . He fussed a lot but he did n't use any violence . " " Thanks , Dallison . " Farrell returned his attention to Hildreth . " Now , Mr. Hildreth , you can tell us what you were doing last night . " " Not a blamed thing , " Hildreth retorted indignantly . " I do n't know who killed Roger Parnell nor anything about it . I was in bed asleep . " Farrell patiently explained . " You understand , of  | course , Mr. Hildreth , that it 's necessary to take statements from everyone who might know something about the motive for this crime . You are the only member of Dis , so far as we know , who claims not to have attended the party at Mrs. Fontenay 's house last night . " " Then I 'm the only one who could n't have done the killing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Baton Rouge . I 'd been there since Sunday . " " And you were in the hotel all Monday evening ? " " Yes . I had dinner in the hotel dining-room with a friend of mine . His name is Gilday . After dinner we went up to my room and he stayed about half an hour . It was about eight o'clock when he left . I read a magazine awhile and went to bed . It was early ? about ten-thirty  --  because I planned to get up early and drive to New Orleans this morning . " " Were you in your room when the telephone rang ? " asked Farrell . " Yes . It woke me up . I did n't answer it because I thought it might be a call from one of my friends to join a party and I did n't want to be bothered . I went to sleep again before this officer came . " Farrell leaned back , studying Hildreth with thoughtful attention . " Dallison said your car was parked downstairs on the side street by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while you are in Baton Rouge ? " " I 've never left it anywhere else , except on stormy nights when I 've put it in a garage . " Hildreth sighed with annoyance at the obtuseness of the law . " Baton Rouge is no big city , Farrell . Everybody leaves cars on the street all night . " " Yes , I know . " Farrell took up his cigar from the ash-tray on his desk and deliberately tapped off the ashes . " You were planning to drive to town this morning to take part in the Dis parade , I believe you said , but you did n't attend the party last night . Was it pressure of business that kept you away ? "  | " Well  --  no . " Hildreth gave an uneasy glance at the reporters . " Is this for publication ? " " Not without my okay , " Farrell answered with a quick glance at the newspapermen . " Well  --  I suppose I ought to be frank . My wife and I have n't been living together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you saw her last night ? and I thought it might embarrass her if she knew I was at the party . She had told me it was necessary for her to be there , as she 's a member of the Council this year , so I stayed in Baton Rouge . " Farrell nodded . " You would n't have run the risk of meeting her in the parade ? " " Women do n't ride in Carnival parades , " Hildreth retorted shortly . For an instant Farrell did not answer . He stroked his cigar along the edge of the ash-tray . Then , after a pause , he asked , " Mr. Hildreth , have you any idea how Roger Parnell obtained your costume to wear to the party last night ? " " No . " " Was it at your apartment or your wife 's ? " " Mine . " Hildreth shrugged . " He might have stolen it . " " Was n't your apartment locked ? " " Yes , but anybody could work one of those antique locks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose so , but I 've got nothing of value there . It 's only a temporary stopping-place . I moved in a month ago . Most of my things are out at my father 's place on Bayou St. John . " Farrell nodded , looking keenly across into Hildreth 's belligerent face . " Is it true , Mr. Hildreth , that you and Mrs. Hildreth are being divorced , and that you and Mrs. Fontenay intended to be married when the decree is issued ? "  | Hildreth flushed slightly . " That 's true , but I do n't see what it 's got to do with this . " " Possibly nothing at all . " Farrell glanced at his watch . " That will be all for the present , Mr. Hildreth . I think we have your address . You 'll be good enough to remain in town , as we may need to talk to you again . " He stood up . " Oh , I wo n't run away . " Hildreth stood up too . " Good morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down from the window-sill and hopped after him , lugging his camera . The other reporters followed , in quest of a more elaborate statement , and Murphy plodded after them to make sure they heard nothing he would not hear also . Farrell gestured behind their backs to Wade , who turned and came back to the desk . " What 's on your mind , Dan ? " " These . " Farrell opened a portfolio . " We combed out Parnell 's apartment this morning . " " What 'd you find ? " Wade sat down eagerly . " This is n't for the public . " " Damn . All right . " Farrell took several slips of paper from the portfolio . He smiled . " Mr. Wade , the prosecution offers in evidence ? " II tGEI ,  | CHAPTER SEVENTEEN " Oh , hurry up ! " pled Wade . " What have you got ? " " First , " said Farrell deliberately , " four cancelled checks , all dated in January and February of this year , or in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drawn for sums of between two and four thousand dollars each and payable to Cynthia Fontenay . " " Whew ! " Wade whistled . Farrell was serious again . " What do you make of them , Wade ? " " She had an interest in the Red Cat , you know . Maybe this means Parnell paid her cut personally . " " That 's reasonable . The Red Cat must have been a pretty profitable enterprise , then . " Farrell turned over the papers . " Here are two more checks  --  five thousand each  --  payable to Fritz Valdon . Dated the third and tenth of January . " " Hm . Maybe a last effort to ward off the split they had later . What else ? " " A letter . " Farrell took out a sheet of paper that looked as if it had been torn in half lengthwise . " Rather , I should say half a letter . Read it . " Wade took the sheet . The letter had been typewritten , and the paper torn jaggedly down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Parnell This note will ser the queen .

The whole thing so some vile plot to make a mu However , you have always had May your exit be full of h Wade read the fragment and looked up with a scowl .  | " This , " he said , " is the sort of thing I 'm no good at . " " Neither , " Farrell admitted with a wry smile , " am I. Of course , it may not mean a thing ? maybe it 's just an old letter he meant to throw away . " " May  --  be , " said Wade . " But I doubt it . The wording is rather odd . Present it . . . everything is regular . . . safely stowed away . ' Sounds as if somebody was keeping something for Parnell that he III was afraid to keep himself . " III Farrell agreed . " The men found it folded up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer of his desk . II The desk was locked and they had to break it open . That makes it look as if Parnell was keeping it on purpose . " " Yes . And this about some vile plot to make a mu  --  ' ? " " Here we are , " said a well-known voice , and the door opened to admit Wiggins , chipper and cheerful , with Murphy at his back . " Picture of Cynthia Fontenay 's next husband safe on the plate , Wade . Whatcha got ? " Wade glanced questioningly at Farrell , to receive a good-natured consent . " Show it to him . He 's already given us one or two good leads . Murphy has seen it . " Wiggins puckered his monkeyish physiognomy at the note and listened to Wade 's account of where it had been found . " Linda cute , ai n't it ? " he commented . " Me , now , I think it 's simple . This not will ser .. . the queen . ' That means serve the queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't she ? Click . " Farrell was listening with a certain amused interest . " What else , Wiggins ? " " Well , some vile plot to make a mu  --  ' What about murder ' as the rest of that word ? Lissen . I 'll read it . Say this is from Esther Morse . Now she 's a nice girl . She ca n't help that bedroom stare , God gave it to her . But she 's in some kinda jam with Parnell and  | she 's been paying for same through the nose . Suppose he 's got some letters . Lissen . " He held up the note , finishing each line as he read . " Parnell This note will ser ve the queen . Have whoever hr ings it or maybe come yourself , present it and anyway , you can be damn sure everything is regular about those lousy letters . It is safely stowed away and we will use violence if we need it . The whole thing so  --  bad it has got my goat and I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have always had the nerve of a brass monkey . May your exit be full of h ell or horror or something . Now , " he finished with a flourish , " how 's that ? " " Very nice , " said Wade , " except that it does n't sound like Esther 's kind of language . I do n't think we are going to get very far this way . There 's only one thing in that letter that I 'm pretty sure about . " " What 's that ? " the other three asked , Murphy ending his question with a sigh of disgust at the whole business . " It is safely stowed away , ' " Wade indicated the fifth line of the message . " That must mean the counterfeit money . If Parnell had not died you would n't have opened his box . The money was safe there . " " Hell , " said Wiggins . " The trouble with you is you ai n't had enough sleep . Why should somebody else have to write to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box ? " Wade laughed ruefully . " That 's right . What about this come yourself , present it ' ? " " You were right in the first place , " said Farrell smiling . " We wo n't get anywhere this way  --  we all read something different in it . For my part I like the part . about May your exit be full of ? ' " He put the note in an envelope .  | " Wait a minute ! " Wade pushed back his chair suddenly . " What about this ? Somebody has something belonging to Parnell . He  --  or she  --  sends Parnell this note . Then he tears it in half . They each keep half , and Parnell can get back his property by presenting this half of the note and matching it with the other half , which is retained by the unknown . How 's that ? " " Ve  --  ry good , " Farrell approved slowly . " Maybe not right , but worth remembering all the same . " Murphy got up lumberingly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please , and it ai n't no business of mine to stop you , " he announced . " But meantime I 'm going to check up typewriters . You get some photostatic copies of that letter made , Farrell , and I 'll find out how many people who knew Parnell own typewriters . Then maybe we 'll get somewhere . " Farrell laughed and agreed . " Perhaps you 're wiser than we are , Murphy . Start on Dis members , will you ? " The telephone on his desk buzzed . He lifted the receiver . " I know about it , " he said after a moment 's listening . " Writ of habeas corpus . Let him go . " He turned back to Wade . " Conroy , " he explained . " They found a judge to sign the writ . " He took up the papers and began putting them back into his portfolio . " This murder , " he went on , " is one with a lot of angles . The Federal men took up the counterfeit notes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of it at all  --  of course , it 's properly their province . But do n't overlook it . " Wiggins grunted approvingly from his perch on the window-sill . " That stuff , " he observed , " might be the junk they 'd give you if you ever won out at the Red Cat . " " No , " said Wade with a chuckle , " they did n't need that . Donahue proved that you could n't win much or often . "  | " That may be another point , " the district attorney suggested . " Somebody who lost big might have taken desperate steps to get revenge . " " Oliver , " suggested Wiggins . " He got the dough last night . Maybe-that tale he told Wade was a lot of aperay . " " Conroy , " said Murphy vindictively . Farrell shrugged . " Oh , get your mind on somebody besides Conroy , Murphy . I know he 's been irritating , but he 's not the only one . " He sighed . " Listen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead and try to fit in the note , the counterfeit money and the gambling house . But right now I think we 'd better stick to our first hunch of finding out everything that happened last night at the party . They tell me that black butler of Cynthia 's is ready to talk . I do n't want him here  --  too many reporters in the press room . I 'll have him brought to the office of a friend of mine on St. Charles Street . " Wade took down the number . " That letter , " Farrell reminded him , " is strictly in the lodge till I release it . Also the fact that Parnell 's strongbox contained counterfeit money . " He looked at his watch . " You fellows go about your business now , and meet me in about an hour . We 'll see the butler and then go over a report I 'm getting on Oliver . Maybe we 'll give the populace a real thrill at the Dis parade . " " Say , " exclaimed Wiggins , jumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " With a grand gesture he reached for Farrell 's telephone and called the coroner 's office . " Hi , hots , " he called into the mouthpiece . " What the coroner say ? Yeah ? Thanks . I 'll come around and take a picture of the kids some day . Yeah , sure I will . Say , be careful of that thing , will you ? Put it in a safe or something . We 'll need it for evidence at somebody 's trial . " He put down the phone and grinned at his astonished colleagues . " Now me , " he said , " Fin nice , I tell the  | police what I know . " Then , tersely and very grandly , he told them about the cord Lucy had found on the balcony . " And , " he added haughtily , " you apes can fool with nigger butlers or crossword puzzles or old gents that make toys , if you wanta , but the chemist says the cord is stained with blood , see , and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hat and camera . " And what I 'm saying , " he added as he walked to the door , " is that where there 's blood there 's action , and I want some action . G'by . " The door slammed and Wiggins was gone .  | CHAPTER EIGHTEEN The hands of the cathedral clock moved toward noon . New Orleans looked like a fairy-tale town on a holiday . The crowds of maskers had thickened in the streets , and the crown flags of Rex streamed jauntily over the heads of a thousand peddlers selling every vendible kind of nonsense . The Mayor and the City Council occupied the reviewing-stand built on the steps of the City Hall , waiting to give the keys of the city to Rex . On the balcony of the Boston Club waited the Queen of Carnival and her maids . Every balcony and every window along the king 's line of march was long since full of mummers , and those too abundantly merry to cling long to any single coign of vantage thronged the streets below . Across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by two policemen big enough to offer successful resistance to importunate maskers who pled to be admitted to the heights . But this platform , like that down by the Boston Club and another built at St. Peter Street and Jackson Square , was sacred , for it was here that photographers mounted to take the pictures of the floats of Carnival . The policemen guarding the platform opposite the City Hall had grown a bit weary . They had said no so many thousand times that when a lanky figure , unmasked and dressed in the ordinary attire of business , emerged from the fantastic throng and put its foot on the lowest step of the scaffold both guardians stiffened their muscles and repeated crossly , " Ca n't go up . You ought to know that . " The objection was languidly good-natured . " I 'm Wade of the Creole . I want to speak to my photographer . He 's up there . " The policemen acquiesced , and Wade bounded up the steps to where Wiggins , in company with photogra-  | phers from the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wiggins waved merrily , snapped the pictures he was busy with , and came over to the rail . " Hi , pops . What 's on your mind ? " Wade spoke in a low voice . " Keep your eyes open . I do n't think anything 's likely to happen here , but I might not see you again before the Dis parade . There might be some fireworks then . " " Sure . " Wiggins nodded solemnly . " I getcha . " " You 'll have a good chance to see what 's going on from the platform . That 's all I meant . " Wade glanced around to see if he was being observed , but the other photographers were busy . " We 're going down now to talk to Cynthia 's butler , " he added . " Farrell has had him brought to an office near here . Want to find out what scared him so last night . " " Okay , " said Wiggins . " Tell him I said howdy . " " All right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laborious progress back to the law office that Farrell was using for Jasper 's questioning ; and as there was no way to make the journey except by pushing through the crowds , it caused him to make some weary reflections as to the general undesirability of people who committed murders on Mardi Gras . Farrell was waiting in the office . " Got the butler ? " Wade asked , sitting down and stretching his tired legs . " He 's here . I had him brought over from the Third . First , though , I wanted to tell you there 's nothing much to be found out about Oliver . " " Mean he 's the figure of mystery ? " " Either that or else he 's the most innocent old fellow in town . He 's lived here all his life . Family not rich , but left him pretty well off , and he 's apparently made a lot of money out of his toy patents . He has spent a lot of time traveling around , and has learned all there is about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , and knows all about toy manufacturing . Keeps a workshop in his house . No friends to speak of . Has several old servants who have worked with him for years . " " Nil , " said Wade tersely . " But he must know somebody , Farrel . How 'd he get into Dis ? " " Oh , he knows a lot of people in a business way , and he seems to be on pretty good terms with two or three Dis members . He 's had Hildreth out to dinner several times lately , and Cynthia once or twice , and occasionally he 's met Conroy or Ghent downtown somewhere and has gone home with him for a drink . When I said no friends I meant no intimates that we could discover . We 've got no evidence that any of those people know him well . " " Then that 's a blank , " said Wade disappointedly . He took out a cigarette and moved nearer to Farrell 's desk to get a match . Farrell was frowning over the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted to admit . Wade considered thoughtfully . Farrell , he knew , had a mind that was methodical rather than intuitive , and though he was expert at presenting evidence he had little talent for ingenious theorizing . " What about his gambling story ? " Wade asked . " Oh , he does gamble quite a lot , and they say that eleven thousand dollars at backgammon would n't be impossible for him . So his story there may be all right . He owns two racehorses , both of them very good , and they run regularly here at Jefferson Track and the Fairgrounds , and in Florida . " Farrell referred to another sheet . " The doctor says there were no powder burns discoverable bullet 's course through the hair , powder burns would not be very likely to show . Oliver did n't lose much blood , so he might have been shamming weakness , but on the other hand a cantankerous old hermit  | might have been knocked to pieces by a thing like that . And what he said about his eyesight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the French window frame , and broken glass inside and outside of the room . " " Where 's he now ? " " Down at the Dis den , getting set for the parade . " " His nerve seems all right , " Wade decided , " but I guess he 's off the cards till that 's over . Let 's have the butler in . " Farrell opened the door and gave the order . " I 've put a man at Oliver 's house , " he added to Wade , " with orders to let me know as soon as he gets back . I think a little more conversation with him about what happened last night is going to be necessary . " " He 's a nuisance to talk to , " Wade warned . The door opened , and Murphy came in with Cynthia Fontenay 's butler and a police stenographer . " Here 's Jasper , " Murphy announced briefly . Jasper stood just inside the door , his black eyes rolling in scared interest around the office . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had no hat , and his hands fumbled with each other . Jasper was black and tall , and looked as if in his moments of dignity he might make an ideal butler , but for the present Jasper 's moments of dignity were over . Farrell gave him an encouraging smile . " Come over here , Jasper . " As Jasper shuffled nearer the desk Farrell went on in his pleasantest manner . " Now we do n't want you to be scared . We 're not going to hurt you . We just want you to tell us , as simply as you can , what happened last night at Mrs. Fontenay 's . " " Yassah . " Jasper 's black eyes wandered with relief from Murphy 's uniformed figure to Farrell and his stenographer . " What dat young lady gonta do , judge ? " Farrell smiled again . " She 's just going to write down what you say so you wo n't have to be called back to say it again in case we forget anything . " " Yassah . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gawd I ai n't . " " We are n't saying you have . " Farrell glanced at the girl . " Ready , Miss Bond ? " Murphy took a belligerent shove at the negro 's elbow . " Jasper , " he demanded with preliminary emphasis , " have you been beaten or mistreated while in the hands of the police ? " Jasper 's wide eyes widened . " Nossah . Not a-tall . Dey treated me just fine . " " Good , " said Farrell . " And you 're ready to tell us what happened last night ? " " Yassah , I sho is . I jes ' did n't want to be in dat jailhouse on Moddygraw , judge . " " All right , boy , tell us what you know about this business , and if we can we 'll let you out right away . " " Yassah . " Jasper gave a hesitating shuffle . " I did n't mean to hurt nobody , sah . How come I got scared was I thought maybe dey thought I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at de jailhouse dat Mistah Parnell was stuck with a knife I jes ' knew I was n't you-all 's man . " Farrell smiled . " But why did you run away , Jasper ? " " Well , sah , I was jes ' scared , judge . Jes ' crazy scared . I said Jasper , get away , ' and away I got . " " Were you in the china-closet when Parnell was killed ? " Jasper shook his black head vehemently . " No sah . I was gone . Long gone , sah . Heah 's how come it happen , judge . When dat boy come in about de pieture-takin ' I told him to wait . Den , judge , I go up on de gallery so as to stand by de do ' like Miss Cynthia tell me . " " When was that ? I mean , what time was it ? " " Lemme see , judge . Dat was jes ' when de lights  |  | went out , yassah . When dey was havin ' de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jasper , you went up on the gallery . Then what happened ? " " Judge , sah , I stood by dat do ' and for awhile everything was quiet . I had a crack in de blinds so I could see de carryin ' on , sah . Yassah , us always has a time at dose parties , yassah . Well ? " Jasper grinned and then , remembering that this was serious business , sobered again ? " well , judge , I was lookin ' th'u dat crack and I see Miss Cynthia comin ' . She come down de hall , yassah , by herse'f . Den she go in de chinacloset . " Jasper 's eyes rolled around again to make sure he was creating a good impression . Observing that everybody was listening with good-humored interest , he proceeded with increased confidence in his own ability to get out of jail for Mardi Gras . " Well , judge , I open de do ' so I can ast her if dere 's somp'n she want . But I hears her talkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Judge , she sho was blessin ' dis man out . She sho was . " Jasper sighed . " Well now , judge , I ai n't gon ' let Miss Cynthia get in no trouble . She all de time treat me pretty nice , judge , and she particular told me dat if dere was any rumpus at de party I was s'posed to look out for things . You see , judge , sometimes dey gets a little bit lit at dem parties , and sometimes Miss Cynthia she get a little bit lit too . So when I heard her blessin ' out dis man in de devil suit I figure maybe she wants protectin ' . So I creep ' round to de back gallery where I can see th'u de pantry window . De window was shut , so I could n't hear what she 's sayin ' , but I open de blind a little ways so I can see in case he gets rough . " Farrell was interested . " And did he get rough , Jasper ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give her  | hell . He jes ' bawl her out plenty . I stop to think if I ought to throw him out , judge , and when I look in again dat devil man is chokin ' her . He 's got his hands round her neck , judge ? " Jasper 's voice rose and his gestures illustrated . " ? round her neck , judge , and he 's shakin ' her ? like so ? " Jasper 's eager hands closed on Wade 's neck and Wade 's startled croak was accompanied by a shake that nearly heaved him to the floor . " Jes ' so , judge , " Jasper exclaimed eagerly . " Shake her like dis  --  so ? " " Yes , Jasper , yes , " panted Wade , extricating himself from the darkey 's eager grasp as Farrell began to chuckle and Murphy angrily grabbed Jasper 's shoulders with a " None o ' that , you ! Stand up straight . " " I 'm all right , Murphy , " Wade managed to say , feeling around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put his feet on the floor again . " Suppose you just tell us what happened , Jasper . I can understand . " Farrell smothered his laughter and lifted a face of polite interest to the excited black figure of Cynthia 's butler . " Yassah , judge . " Jasper , somewhat subdued , thought a minute to recapture the thread of his narrative . " He was choking her , " Farrell prompted . " What did you do ? " " Well , sah , " said Jasper , " I jes ' open dat window as fast as I could and I heave myself th'u . I say , Jasper , you ai n't gon ' let no devil man choke any white lady you work for . ' So I heave myself th'u and I hit dat devil man a knock in de jaw . " " Oh  --  you did , did you , " said Farrel slowly . " Did he fall ? " Jasper grinned a broad ivory grin . " You bet he fall , judge . He tumble down right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ? What did Miss Cynthia do ? " " Why judge , she run . She just put her hands up to her neck like to see if she got any breath left , and  | den she run . She get out of dat pantry so fast I do n't hardly see her a-tall . But dat devil man  --  well sir , he bang de table with his head when he fall down and he just lie there . So I do n't know what to do . I figure he done been hit pretty hard , and I say , Jasper , somp'n gon ' happen to you sho 's you born when you go hittin ' white gen ' 1'men too hard . ' So I just creep out of dat window , judge , and shut it again and creep around de gallery and wait till I see de light come on inside . Den I sneak in , and soon 's I see Miss Cynthia she jes ' say , quick-like , Jasper , go down and tell de photographer we 're ready . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , judge . So I go down and tell de man he can come up to take de pictures . " " What time was that ? " " Judge , I ai n't studyin ' about time . I jes ' know I hit a white man and if he 's hurt dere 's gon ' be trouble . " " I see . So you went down to get the photographer ? " " Yassah . I go down to get de picture man . Little fellow . He been talkin ' to Miss Lucy . He and me go up and Miss Cynthia do n't say nothin ' to me . She do n't look like dere 's any trouble a-tall . Judge , dat sure is one smooth white lady . After de picture man go she tell me to wait downstairs and she 'll phone down if she need any more liquor . Well , I wait down dere , and I 'm keepin ' out of de way of dat white man , judge . You know I could n't let him choke Miss Cynthia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I understand , " nodded Farrell . " What happened then ? " " Well , after while nothin ' happen , and I wonder if dat white man is come to . Seems like I jes ' ca n't wait much longer . So I figure if I phone upstairs I 'll ask Miss Lucy if dey need any ice or anything and if dere 's been any trouble I 'll hear about it . So I take down de receiver , and dat phone is on de same line as de phone in a back room upstairs . And I take dat receiver down and I hear Miss Lucy callin ' de police . "  | Jasper heaved a mighty breath and his eyes rolled toward the ceiling . " Lawd , judge , I was scared . Miss Lucy she say Police , come quick . Dere 's a dead man here . ' So I say , Jasper , get goin ' . ' So I go , judge . Farrell rested his chin on his hands and gave Jasper a long puzzled look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you at all ? " he asked after a pause . " Judge , Miss Cynthia did n't mention nothin ' . She done let me stay in de jailhouse . I guess she was plumb scared too . But when I heard dem say dat man was knife-killed , I knew I did n't kill him . I ai n't had no knife . Somebody else kill him after I knock him over . So I figure I better talk wid de court . So dat 's all I know about what happens , judge . Fo ' Gawd , it is . " Jasper stood beaming , his statement made . Through the window came faint strains of a band playing " If Ever I Cease to Love . " Jasper 's foot began to tap . He was eager . This was the song of Rex . If they let him go now , he could run around and see the parade . Farrell had gone over to a cabinet in a corner of the room . He took out a thick package in a manila envelope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife that had killed Parnell slid to the table . " Did you ever see that knife , Jasper ? " Farrell asked . But he might have spared the words . Jasper was staring down at the knife on the desk as if it epitomized all the awfulness in the world . His mouth was open and his eyes wider than ever . " Whose knife is that ? " barked Murphy . " Yours ? " Jasper jerked back . " No sah. , no sah , dat knife ai n't mine ! I declare fo ' Gwad it ai n't , judge ! Dat knife ' belong to Mistah Fontenay . I seen it a million times . " " To Mr. Fontenay ? " Wade repeated . " I thought he was in Europe . " " Yassah , he off some place . But he done left dat  | knife when he quit Miss Cynthia . Miss Cynthia , she been usin ' dat knife to open letters . It been on de little desk in her sittin ' room . I know dat knife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ befo ' he quit Miss Cynthia , dat dat 's a fine knife . Not but two in de world like it . Mistah Fontenay he have dat for years and years . Mistah Oliver done give it to him . Mistah Oliver is de onliest man got another one . Yassah , judge . And Miss Cynthia she been open ' her letters wid dat knife ever since she done up and quit wid Mistah Fontenay . Fo ' Gawd , judge . "  | CHAPTER NINETEEN When Jasper was paroled according to promise , Wade and Murphy and Farrell squared their shoulders as though to brave a storm and stepped into the gay maelstrom of St. Charles Street . The crowds on the sidewalk surged back from the curb , jamming them against the wall . Twice , three times , Murphy tried to make a passage through the laughing multitude by use of his great voice and his gold badge , but it was no use . Rex was coming . It was his day to rule . Not only was it virtually impossible for the members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not occur to them to try to do it . Rex was coming . They paid no attention to more commonplace minions . " If we can get to the curb , " Wade suggested , " I think we can make it . " " Yeah ? " grunted Murphy . He looked without appreciation at the shining confusion . " Well , hold in your elbows and duck . " They ducked . At least , they tried to . But those who have to attend to business on Mardi Gras are in a sorry plight . Every one of those jammed exhilirated maskers knew his rights . The idea was to get as close as possible to the steel cables that roped off the sidewalk , and to stay there ; so long as there was no disorder , not a policeman on earth had the power to make them move . Farrell got his foot out from under that of a hilarious Hindu and sighed . " We 've got to get downtown , " he said with determination . " If we let her get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wade , shoved back and forward by the milling thousands , grinned . Already he could hear the music of the first band leading .1re Rex parade . Already , far up the street , he could hear the joyous cheers of the maskers greeting the king . The crowd around him was  | swaying to the rhythm of the Carnival song . A gayly bedizened pirate looked down at the Hula dancer beside him and began to since " If ever I cease to love , If ever I cease to love , May I be stuffed with sausage meat , If ever I cease to love . " The crowd around , dancing and throwing confetti , joined in the song . " Damn ! " said Murphy . " Keep your elbows in , " Wade advised . He chuckled . Murphy had folded his arms , and stood in the crowd like a rock in the midst of a heaving sea . Wade caught Farrell 's eye , and they both laughed . The same thought had struck them both . They were ready to arrest a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of organized law and decency behind them , and they were helpless ; not by reason of those who thrived on lawlessness , but by the merry opposition of the holiday which is boasted as being the most orderly day of pleasure in the world . They were both close to sharing Murphy 's impotent wrath . Keeping as close together as they could , they had with infinite effort struggled ten feet . Wade paused for breath and looked around him . Mardi Gras . The banners and the confetti and the music . Countless thousands of sober men and women cheering a makebelieve king . Insensibly , irresistibly , the thrill of Mardi Gras crept into him . The sky like thick blue velvet ; the magic floats twinkling in the abundant sunshine ; at the City Hall , a block or two away , the crown float of Rex halting while the Mayor and the City Council saluted Rex and passed him the keys to the city gates . Again the music sounded , the procession moved , the tinsel tops of the floats sparkled down the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strained ; the maskers riding the floats flung favors into the crowds  --  necklaces of glass beads ,  | toys and trinkets of no value , which would be treasured by those who caught them till their grandchildren were old . Mardi Gras . A Quaker girl , her lips a deep incongruous scarlet under her half-mask , drank a toast from a silver flask . An Indian chief stood beside her , his arm protectingly around her waist . The parade passed them ; twenty floats drawn by mules , harnessed in gold and silver for this day of their glory . Between the floats marched the musicians , playing the gay silly anthem of the nonsense king . The Quaker girl began to sing the song , and suddenly Wade caught himself singing too  --  the merry song that was first sung in New Orleans by a little music-hall dancer named Lydia Thompson , and which , because Lydia Thompson so delighted the Russian Duke Alexis when he came to town to greet the first King of Carnival , has been kept ever since as the official anthem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , If ever I cease to love , May dogs and cats quit chasing rats , If ever I cease to love ! " " Hey , you ! " said Murphy . " Keep movin ' . " Wade laughed and struggled obediently forward , through the crowd of maskers . Strange . They were going to arrest a murderer . He wondered if anybody else knew about Cynthia Fontenay . Perhaps somebody did . Somebody here . A glum-faced clown with a lugubrious smile painted across his white mask might be trying too to get down to Jackson Square , where Dis was to hold its revels , to warn her . Or perhaps the sober frocked friar pushing his patient bulk against the pack of humanity might be hiding his haste to get off in the other direction . They forced their way on . Their progress was maddeningly slow . If they were held up now , with the Druids ' parade following that of Rex , it would mean an hour 's delay , and if in the meantime a warning  | whisper should have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a back-street route , taking her secrets with her . Or possibly  --  and Wade went cold at the idea . possibly she had been warned already , and was triumphantly slipping past him now , in mocking anonymity . He looked at the maskers , trying to recognize her under one of the crazy costumes . A group of girls with purple pompons dancing on their white suits ran alongside him , singing Lydia 's song . " If ever I cease to love , If ever I cease to love . . May all the seas turn into ink , May negroes all turn white , May the queen in Buckingham palace die , May we all get drunk tonight , May cows lay eggs , may hens give milk , May the elephant turn a dove , May dogs refuse to eat fresh meat , If ever I cease to love . If ever I cease to love , If ever I cease to love , Potatoes will grow on a mulberry mow , If ever I cease to love ! " With a grim fury they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . At length the last float had gone by . The crowds broke for a minute to shove into the street and run for a few steps in the wake of Rex and his pageant . In a minute , Wade knew , the Druids ' parade would start , and it would be just as bad again . A sudden heave and a sweep of people caught him up . Murphy he could see just ahead of him ; Farrell was lost to his sight . Propelled relentlessly , Wade moved out , blowing confetti from his lips and brushing ticklers from his ears . In another minute he had reached the steel cable , and he ducked under to stand in the street with the revelers . Murphy was there too , hastily gathering four policemen who had been patrolling the curb lines .  | Farrell showed up in the middle of a bevy of sailorgirls who had formed a ring around him and were singing an invitation to come and play on Mardi Gras . ' Wade chuckled as the ring broke and Murphy and the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uproariously at the bellowing orders of the policemen . And then , with a storm of confetti and a blare of horns , they broke their circle and scampered off . Wade pushed his way to the officers . " Get us through this crowd , " Murphy was ordering . " We 'll pick up a car over at the First Precinct and sweep down around the New Basin canal . " He turned to explain to Farrell . " That gives us a chance to go down Esplanade Avenue to the river and then back to Jackson Square . " The police escort started , and pushing its way through the crowds that were already solidifying to cheer the Druids , cleared a passage to the far side of the street and through to the back streets by which they could make their way to the precinct station . Wade almost regretfully left the hilarious throng . Behind him he could hear the cries ? " Here come the Druids ! " " I see the first float ! " " It hurts my eyes  --  it 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance the strains of Lydia 's old song came faintly . He did not listen . His long legs keeping pace with the running steps of Murphy and Farrell and their panting escorts , Wade hurried off with them to arrest the murderer . The back streets , where the parades did not pass , were nearly empty . They made their way to the nearest police station and hurriedly commandeered a car . With long sighs of relief they lay back on the seat and Murphy gave quick orders . " It ai n't time yet for the Dis parade , " he explained as the car started . " I figure we 'll run around through these back streets till we get as close to Jackson Square as we can , then we 'll get out . There wo n't be any way  | to get to the square but to fight like we 've been doing , but my idea is to get to the square , and then we 'll be all right . Cynthia 's due to sit on the balcony of the upper Pontalba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dis can drink to her when he goes by , and she 'll be there . We can slip inside the building and arrest her quiet-like , without anybody knowing what we 're up to . " " And Oliver ? " asked ' Wade . " He 'll be riding a float , masked . " " We 'll find out which float he 's in . The parade wo n't start till the queen comes out on the balcony . They 'll hold it up , thinking she 's having an extra drink inside . " " And you 'll nab him before anybody knows Cynthia 's arrested ? " " That 's the idea . Hey , Flanagan , " Murphy called to the driver , " keep going ! What 's the matter ? " The driver , who had abruptly halted the ear , turned a woebegone face to the back seat . But Farrell had already looked out and was sinking back with a groan . " 0 my God , we forgot the darkys ! It 's the Zulu King ! " Wade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , felt himself in danger of giving way to something very like hysteria . He wanted to laugh , foolishly , immoderately . The impossibility of doing anything on Mardi Gras was something he had frequently written about for the columns of his paper , but which he had never understood before . Their progress was stopped . Before them was a moving sea of black faces . Their ears were assailed by the slow dull thrump of jungle music and the soft swinging rhythm of black laughter . Along the street , in marvelous savage panoply , rode the ruler of the negro Carnival , the Zulu King . grandly decked in a grass skirt and strings of beads and feathers and flowers , leading a line of floats on which rode singing darky revelers dressed like their cannibal forebears . There was no help for it . They were halted . To try  | to force a car through that black mob would be to cause a massacre and a riot . " Wade , " said Farrell solemnly , " if you do n't quit giggling I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sorry . " Wade sighed and looked out . " This is the end of the parade , Farrell . They 'll follow it around to Rampart Street , and as soon as they do we can have the road cleared . It wo n't be long . " " Please God , " said Murphy devoutly . They waited . " We can get through now , " said Farrell at length . He leaned and beckoned to the policeman on the corner . After a few words of instruction the way was clear . " Take any route you can , " Farrell said to the driver . " Get us as close to Jackson Square as possible , then we 'll get out . " The driver did his best . But three blocks from the square he stopped again . It was obvious that he could go no further . Even here , as far as they could see , the mass of human beings was solid . " Lord ! " said Murphy . " This is awful . I 've never in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But Wade , who had gotten out , understood . He heard the murmurs of conversation around him . These people in the street knew that somebody in Dis would probably be arrested for murder before night . As they pushed their way toward the square , Wade listened to what was being said around him , and smiled grimly . There were some who were enthusiastic , who thought it was sporting to have the parade in spite of everything , to hold to the great tradition of Mardi Gras . There were others who said frankly that they thought it was indecent . There were some who devoutly prophesied that the wrath of heaven would descend on these people who had no reverence for death . At last , after working with heroic determination that would have seen them through a war , they reached the square . They stopped . They looked at one another .  | They had been defeated . To get from the square across to the balcony where Cynthia was going to sit with her maids would have required an army tractor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets were packed till it seemed that the walls must give in from the pressure of humanity against them . Balconies of the houses facing the square were loaded almost to the breaking point . The statue of General Jackson in the square was covered with maskers like a lump of sugar black with ants . Every tree was bending under its weight of occupants . The sheds of the French Market between the square and the river had been seized upon as vantage points . It was as impossible to move through those crowds as it would have been to walk through the tanglewood of a forest a million years old . This was an impasse . Additional policemen , who had been detailed to guard the cables that kept the crowd off the route of the parade , were sweating with the enormity of their task . Murphy looked across to the balcony where Cynthia would sit . It was the only empty space in sight . " We ca n't do it , " said Farrell . Murphy sighed and wedged himself against the iron railing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ca n't . But remember this . If we ca n't move , she ca n't either . She wo n't be able to leave that house . She 's caught just as thoroughly as she 'd be if we already had her in handcuffs . " Wade agreed . He glanced over to the guarded photographers ' platform where he could see Wiggins , busily shoving plates in and out of his camera . Beside Wiggins sat a masked little figure in a Pierrette costume , who Wade instinctively knew was Lucy . The sun sparkled on her red hair with a brightness that reached him across the street . There was a shuffle and a murmur in the crowd , a nudging of elbows and whispers that grew into a shout .  | " There she is ! " There she was  --  Cynthia Fontenay , queen of Dis . She advanced upon the balcony , in the white robe and tiara of Dis , followed by ten figures in red devil costumes and masks . For a moment she stood quite still , holding out her jeweled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly , triumphantly , as though she could hear the whispers and was proud that she stood serenely above them all . " It was her house he was killed in . Some people say she did it . Did you ever see such nerve ? Standing up there ? " " I think she 's marvelous . That 's what you call real courage . " " Indecency , I call it . Not caring ? " Cynthia smiled calmly down at the mob , as they strained and shoved for the sight of her . She was white and cool and shining , in her robe caught at the waist with a jeweled cestus , and the tiara of Dis on her bright golden hair . " There she is , " said Murphy stolidly . " She that murdered her husband last night . " Wade looked back at Cynthia . He looked at her cool effrontery , at her callous , triumphant smile . Involuntarily he shivered . He saw Wiggins briskly pointing his camera toward her and snapping . Wiggins watched Cynthia as she held her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned to sit down . She chatted with her maids while they waited for the arrival of the king of Dis . He turned to look at Lucy . " Lucy , " he said in a low voice , " I never saw such a woman . She do n't give a damn . " Lucy shook her head . " It took lots of liquor to brace up her nerve , Tony . " " I do n't believe it . She do n't look it . " " You 'd believe it if you 'd been with her all morning . But I do n't see how she does it , anyway . "  | Wiggins was silent . Then he started . There was another cheer from the crowd . " There they come ! " The music had sounded in the distance . The policemen pressed the mob back behind the cables . The space beneath Cynthia 's balcony was clear . An attendant ran forward and set up a long step-ladder that reached up almost as high as the wrought-iron balcony rail . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to present flowers to the queen , and to drink her health and shatter the glass on the pavement . Cynthia edged her chair a trifle forward , to look at the advance of the parade . First came the musicians , playing , not the gay nonsense anthem of Carnival , but music that had been written for Dis . Queer , disturbing music , music that was not angry but that was not quite gay  --  music that had in it something of the suggestion of a rattle . Behind came the throne float of the king . Wiggins focussed his camera and photographed the parade as it advanced . " Who 's king this year ? " he whispered to Lucy . " Arnold Ghent . But do n't say I told you . " Wiggins looked at the advancing floats . They were magnificent . They were artistic . But they were not beautiful . They were not like the floats of the other Carnival parade . These were in a vague disturbing sense , a defiance of the lovely tradition of Mardi Gras . The title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclaiming that the subject of the parade was " Things I Do n't Want To Be . " Wiggins looked beyond . He saw a float that represented a rat in a trap  --  a gigantic red rat , kicking against the vast ugly trap that held its head . There was a lump of sugar as big as a house , swarming with mansize red cockroaches . There was a goldfish bowl , cunningly devised of steel wires covered with cellophane , in which hung a man covered with a gilt goldfish suit .  | Wiggins shrugged with disgust . This was not Mardi Gras . This was  --  it was Dis . He did not look at the floats that followed . He turned again to the king 's float at the head of the parade . The king , his red devil suit half covered by a magnificent sable-bordered cape , rode under a canopy embroidered with red and black devils , and behind his throne leaped up red and yellow papier-mache flames . Wiggins made a disgusted moue as he turned his camera full on the throne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a semi-circle under the balcony . The negroes leading the mules of the king 's float brought it to a stop so that the king could reach the ladder . The music rose in a swift rebellious tempo . Cynthia stood up . One hand rested lightly on the balcony rail , the other raised her scepter and held it toward the king . He stood and bowed low to her . The crowd shouted and then held its breath . A page handed him a glass of champagne . He climbed the ladder . He drank to her , held the glass high , and flung it to the pavement . It crashed in a thousand bright splinters . The page came halfway up the ladder and handed him an enormous bouquet of red roses . The king held them high , toward Cynthia . She handed her scepter to one of her maids , and leaned forward , both hands out to receive them . Then . . . Every one of the thousands who saw the hellish pandemonium of the Dis parade had a different story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their platform , heard the shriek and the shattering noise and saw the ladder quiver and go under , hurtling Arnold Ghent back as Cynthia fell forward through the gap in the broken balcony rail , a white streak crumbling on the pavement below . They saw the mules rear in blind terror and dash madly ahead , and heard the wild panic  | in the square and the screams of those who were knocked down in the struggle for escape . Afterwards , it was hard to say that they or anyone else had seen more than this . For Wiggins and Lucy had both leaped frantically down from the photographer 's platform and had rushed forward to where they saw lying on the pavement under the balcony the broken white thing that had been Cynthia , and they knew , before Wade or Farrell or Murphy knew , that she was dead .  | C H A P T E R T W E N T Y On the platform which fifteen minutes before had supported the cameramen , Farrell stood like a field marshal staging a retreat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually shaping the frantic crowd into order . Ambulances screamed their way through the side streets . One of them had already taken away Cynthia 's body , and another had rushed Ghent to a hospital . Wiggins , who had bounded back up the steps of the platform , was making pictures as fast as his hands could work , and swearing at anyone who blocked his lens . In a drug store that had been turned into a temporary infirmary Wade had found a telephone , and was pouring the story into the ear of a tense rewrite in . Looking out of the window he could see the police at work . Mounted men were carefully riding back the crowds , guiding them into streets where they could get away . A. squad of traffic officers was roping off the space around the line of floats , most of which had been instantly deserted by their occupants , but one or two of which still held maskers who could not get off without help . The red rat was still in his trap , kicking violently and yelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinned in . The negroes who had led the mules were being aided by policemen in holding the mules back from the pushing mobs that were being gradually lessened by the press of bluecoats . Murphy was everywhere . Wade could see him ruthlessly charging some straggler who had proved too agile for the police lines , and breaking off his string of threats to lift up a child and gently deposit her beyond the ropes out of harm 's way . From the window he could see the goldfish bowl , its imitation fish swinging from the wire by which it hung . " You might use the rat and the goldfish for a front-  | page box story , " he added to the rewrite man . " I ca n't see from here whether there are any others who ca n't get out of the floats without help , but I 'll let you know . Wait a minute ? " as another of the reporters who had been hurried down to help cover the story came in with a statement . " Here 's the police estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to Charity Hospital . Twenty or thirty arrests for interfering with police work  --  they 're at the Third Precinct . Nobody killed  --  except Mrs. Fontenay  --  but it 's a hellish thing to see and I wish you 'd put in a line about the great work the cops are doing , and give Murphy special mention  --  he deserves it . Ghent was rushed off to Charity too . He may be badly hurt  --  you 'll have to find out there . From what I could see , he fell backward when Cynthia 's body struck the ladder , and landed on his float , breaking down the canopy that covered the throne . Farrell 's here and doing a swell job . Wiggins sent in some plates  --  I suppose they 'll have to do for the extra , but he 's taking plenty more for the first night edition . I 'll call again for the replate as soon as I get some more . " He hung up and went outside . The ambulances were still coming . A platoon of firemen had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrant . The threat seemed enough for the crowd and they fell back . But only for a moment . There was a new rush at the far side of the square . More injuries , more arrests and a team of bolting mules ; Wade dashed back to see what had happened and hurried over to the phone . Wiggins was shooting pictures , using plates as fast as they could be delivered to him by copy boys hurrying to and from the office , ducking in and out of brawls and tangles , stepping out of the way of the mounted police , eluding the battling hoofs of scared mules , running here and there and stopping to shoot what he wanted . Wade smiled with a sense of admiring comrade-  | ship as he watched him . Wiggins , in his own fashion , was an artist . At last it was over . At last the policemen had emptied the square , and formed a cordon before the house where Cynthia had been , to keep off curious sightseers . Wade joined Wiggins , and they walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murphy were talking to Chief Donahue . Wade climbed up to them . " Now that the extra 's in , " he said , " what are you saying about the death of Mrs. Fontenay ? " Murphy 's big hands made a gesture of despair . " Wurra , wurra , " he moaned , " I do n't even want to think about it . " " Neither do I. " Wade smiled with a sort of tense sympathy . " But we 've got to . " Farrell , sitting precariously on the rail of the scaffold , sighed wearily . " Murphy thinks it was suicide , " he told Wade . " How about the coroner ? " demanded Wiggins . " What does he think ? " " He 's up there now . " Murphy signalled to the balcony with a jerk of his thumb . " As near as I can make it out , " Farrell went on , " that old iron balcony rail broke when she leaned on it . She had to lean out to reach for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , we better get up where the coroner is , " Wiggins proposed briskly . " ' We ca n't get anywhere by just sitting here on the mouners ' bench . " Chief Donahue shook his head disapprovingly . " Just another story , eh , son ? " " Think so ? " Wiggins perked up indignantly . " Listen , chief . I did n't drive that dame to jump just by taking her picture , did I ? If you ask me , this death can be chalked up against the building department . That balcony was n't safe , was it ? That rail is probably about a coupla hundred years old . She leans against  | it  --  bang ! Then up pops the jamboree . Look what it cost me , willya ? " Wiggins sadly displayed the ruin of his coat , torn to rags by his battling through the crowd for pictures . " Hell , " he went on grimly . " Murphy 's conscience is all that 's bothering him . " " Now what , " demanded Murphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right ! " Wiggins shouted . " You say suicide , because you were after the dame for murder . I say accident , because she did n't know you were after her . How 's that ? " He turned briskly . " Come on , Wade , let 's go up and see what the corner says . I 'll bet any of you a new suit of clothes that he says accidental death . " They had reached the spot on the pavement where Cynthia 's body had struck . Wiggins winced . " It was  --  pretty terrible , was n't it ? " said Wade slowly . " Shut up , " snapped Wiggins . " What you doing ? trying to make me cry ? Listen . I could cry easy enough without you , but I ai n't gonta . I 'm here on business , see ? " Wade smiled , understandingly . He had appreciated his little partner 's valiant efforts to cover up how he felt . Wade felt somewhat the same way himself . He wondered if Cynthia had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that led from the coriridor of the old building . On the second landing they turned into a doorway and went through a disordered living room , where masks and costumes had been thrown helter-skelter by Cynthia 's companions in the frantic moments that had followed her death . Four or five police officers and a half a dozen detectives stood around the door leading to the balcony . The coroner came forward as they entered . " Just the men we want , " he said to Murphy and Farrell . " Come over here . Matson 's got the broken piece of grill-work . He picked it up and brought it in before some crazy souvenir-hunter could get to it . " Ii  | Murphy nodded and asked one or two questions more , as Farrell and Wade leaned over the broken pieces laid carefully on the floor . " What does it show , Dr. Emerson ? " Farrell asked anxiously . " Suicide ? Or accident ? Or ca n't you tell yet ? " The coroner shook his head . He looked at Farrell intently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE " Murder ? " Wade repeated . " Murder ? " he said again , incredulously , as the coroner nodded . " You mean one of those women on the balcony with her pushed her over ? " " They could n't have , " said Wiggins . He jumped forward to explain . " They did n't push her , doe . I was close . I saw . There was n't one of ' em who coulda pushed her over . " Farrell gave him a silencing look . He was evidently more troubled than he wanted to own . " What do you mean , Emerson ? Are you sure ? " " Sure , " said Emerson succinctly . " I 'll show you . " He knelt down and gravely pointed to the two sections of wrought-iron railing that were lying on the floor . " This is bad business , Farrell , and I 'm not denying you 've got good reason to be upset . Whoever did this meant it to look like accident , and if it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said accident at the inquest . " He beckoned them to sit on the floor by him , and indicated the broken railing again . " That rail was a solid piece . Of course it 's old . But it has probably been reinforced at the supports many times since the building was first put up a hundred years ago . It 's perfectly solid and safe . It did n't break of its own accord . " He indicated one broken end with a pencil . " Look , " he said . " Here on the end you 'll see two or three faint dents . That shows somebody used a hammer . " " My God , " said Wade under his breath . " Whoever did it , " went on the coroner , " started with a file , and then , in order to make it look like a clean break , used a mallet or a hammer to finish it . " He pointed to the other end . " This is from the bottom . You can see it was filed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silvery lead-like substance from the end of the bar . " Solder was used to hold this side in place . The other side ? " he turned the filed end toward them ? " was filed almost through . The cracks were filled with what looks like gun-grease or shoe polish . I 'm not peeling it off , as you 'll need it for evidence at somebody 's trial . " Farrell , who was crouching opposite him on the floor , examined the broken rail as though trying hopelessly to find evidence that the coroner was mistaken . There was an element of baffled despair in his movements . Wade , who knew what Farrell was feeling at this sudden proof that they must begin again to solve the mystery , did not try to make him speak . Instead he turned to Emerson . " Then it 's murder , " he said flatly . " And the person who did it knew every detail of the Dis ceremony . He knew that the king 's ladder would have its own support and not lean against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have caused a lot of inconvenience , but no death . He knew too that when Cynthia reached for the flowers she would have to lean over the rail . " Emerson shrugged , the final impatient shrug of the doctor who has spoken . " Murder , " he said , " and mighty well planned . " Murphy grimly bit the end off a cigar . " And not a doubt , " he added , " that a fall from that balcony would be fatal . " " Hardly any , " Emerson agreed . " The balcony is about twenty feet from the sidewalk . Cynthia was leaning forward to receive the flowers , and I guess the murderer knew she would be . That would be almost certain to make her fall head foremost . The murderer was pretty clever . " " And damn desperate too , " Murphy exclaimed with sudden anger . " My Lord , boys , do you get what he did ? He was out to kill her , but he did n't care who  | else he killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercy that there were n't a hundred more deaths in that square . Do you get that ? " He turned upon them with rising fury . " Boys , the man that did this thing is going to hang for it or there 's no justice . If he do n't I 'll turn in my badge . " For a moment Wade was silent . Then , slowly , he got to his feet . " I 'm afraid you 're right , Murphy . I thought Cynthia killed that man last night . I thought she came back in after the butler knocked him out , and stuck the knife in while he was unconscious . But she did n't . I wish to God we 'd been here in time to arrest her for it , though  --  we 'd have saved her life . " " Sure and we 'd have saved a lot else , too , " Murphy exploded . " There 's thirty or forty people in Charity Hospital this minute because of this thing ! And any of ' em might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clamped on his hat . " Give us the report as soon as you can , doe . Come on , fellows : I want to get to work . " The others got to their feet . Farrell paused to speak again to the coroner . " Look here , Dutreaux , " Murphy called from the door , " I want Oliver . " " Oliver , " Wade repeated . " That 's not a bad hunch . " " Sure it ai n't a bad hunch , " Wiggins agreed . " Oliver had that ten grand , did n't he ? He shot off a big fairytale about how he got it , did n't he ? He mighta shot hisself in the back , could n't he ? Oliver ai n't a bad hunch at all . " " But look here , you , " Murphy added to Dutreaux and Wiggins jointly , " do n't let anybody know how bad I want him . Just pick him up . " Dutreaux agreed . " Out to his house , I guess , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parade . " " I guess so . And have a couple of men out to get  | Conroy . That damn Conroy has got a lot of questions to answer . " " Okay , sir . I 'll have them look for him . " " Now gentlemen , " Murphy wound up , turning grimly to Farrell and Wade , " we 'll waste about forty minutes in palaver if you like , and after that I 'm going to put somebody on the books for murder . " " Fine . " Farrell was smiling as though relieved to have something even faintly amusing to smile at . " We 'll go to my office . " He paused to speak to Dutreaux . " Get hold of the sister in charge of the emergency ward at Charity and find out how badly hurt Arnold Ghent is and how soon he 'll be able to talk . He might know something about this . " " Get Hildreth too , " Wiggins volunteered glumly . " Maybe he 's the guy we 're after . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clambered into the waiting auto . ' Wiggins scrambled in beside the driver . Wade and Murphy and Farrell , in the back seat , were dourly silent as they drove toward the end of the square , which was still a-buzz with scattered groups talking about the near-riot that had interrupted the Dis parade . Wiggins had started an animated argument with the chauffeur about the relative value of mounted men and foot police in controlling a panicky mob , when suddenly there was a scream of brakes and the car swerved . The driver grew eloquently profane at a boy of about fifteen , who had come dashing out from behind another car . The boy laughed , and as the driver swore expertly at him , he pointed an automatic moviescope and caught the chauffeur 's wrathful physiognomy before he ran off . " Them damn kids , " said the chauffeur under his breath as he started the car again . " Look here , you , " said Wiggins suddenly . " I got ta get , out . You coppers ca n't drive and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | The car pulled up to the curb . Wiggins grabbed his camera and jumped out . " Where are you going , kid ? " Wade called after him , " Well , I 'm going by the Creole office a little while , and then I 'll run up to your pow-wow . In the meantime , I got an idea . " " An idea ? " Murphy frowned . " Sure , an idea . Ever have one ? They make you feel like you 'd just swallowed a pineapple . See you later . "  | CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO The declining sun slanted through the bay windows behind Farrell 's desk , throwing long bars of light across the smoke-swirled room . Murphy walked up and down the office , his hands clasped behind his broad back . Farrell and Wade sat at the desk , piles of Police Department memorandum sheets in front of them . The faces of all three of them sagged with weariness , disappointment and defeat . They all felt as if they were facing a hopeless bafflement , fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had but just now realized , a killer so desperate that the lives of countless innocent men and women and children were negligible if they stood in the way of his purpose . They remembered those terrible minutes of panic in the square , and shuddered to think what might have happened but for good fortune and the efficiency of the police reserves . They had talked and talked , studying every report with acute attention and going over every detail their own memories could furnish , trying to find some flicker that would light their way to the man or woman they were seeking , and without result . Now , for some moments , they had been silent . Farrell leaned back in his chair , one hand holding the fist made by the other , thinking ; WTade leaned over , his chin resting on the back of his bony hand , smoking as steadily as though the murderer 's name lay at the end of a chain of cigarettes ; Murphy walked up and down , the thump of his feet making the only sound in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk . " This is the way I see it , boys , " he announced . " Parnell was killed for one reason and Cynthia for another . But whatever prompted Cynthia 's murder had something to do with her knowledge of Parnell 's racket . " Wade looked up , thoughtfully crushing out his cigarette . " But it strikes me , Murphy , that Cynthia told  | us about everything she knew when she admitted that she 'd been married to Parnell and that she was collecting his tribute from Esther Morse . " Murphy stalked over to the desk and thumped his heavy forefinger on the sheaf of reports in front of Wade . " Look here , son . You 've been studying these things for a long time , both of you . What makes you think Cynthia told you everything ? She did n't tell a single thing that was n't dragged out of her with pincers . She did n't own up about that marriage till Wiggins found it out . She did n't say a word about the money till we closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason she told about it then was because she realized that we could trace the bills finally . " Wade glanced at Farrell . Farrell nodded in affirmation . " Then , " Murphy was going on , " we find on top of her other sidestepping that she forgot to tell us about the row in the pantry with Parnell . Of course , she might not have known it was Parnell she had the row with , but we do know that if that nigger had n't told us about the fight in the pantry we 'd never have heard about it from Cynthia . Oh , she did n't have no trouble forgetting things , poor woman  --  maybe if she 'd told us more she might have saved her life . " Farrell held up his hand for a pause . " Is this your idea , then  --  that each time you talked to Cynthia you got closer to the truth , and that whoever killed Parnell realized that she was gradually telling the whole story ? And that he moved just in time to block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's it . " Murphy banged the table decisively . Farrell sat back again to think . Wade lit another cigarette , and as he blew out the match he slowly shook his head . " Ca n't see it , Murphy . If you 're right , the murderer had plenty of foresight . " Murphy scowled . " What do you mean . "  | " Well , it 's like this , Murphy . " Wade spoke deliberately , pausing between his phrases to set his ideas in order . " This thing today was no hurry-up job . It could n't have been . Whoever killed Cynthia Fontenay had to cut through the balcony rail . That was done last night or maybe the night before or possibly before that . It could n't have been done after daylight this morning . Hell , Murphy , the street under that balcony was full of people from sunrise . " " That 's so , " Murphy achnitted reluctantly , but Wade was hurrying on . " If he 'd used a gun or a knife it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of panic . It would be easy to say then that one murder was planned and the other had to be done to cover up the first . But the way it was  --  I ca n't see it as an emergency killing . " Murphy kicked forward a chair and sat down . " What 's your idea , Farrell ? " " Wade sounds right , but he may be wrong , " Farrell said . " The balcony rail could have been cut very early this morning just after your last talk with Cynthia . " " Assuming , of course , that the murderer knew what Cynthia told us , " Wade put in . " But if Cynthia 's murder was n't planned at the same time as Parnell 's , it was planned very shortly after . Remember , the murderer had just one chance of missing , and that was if the Dis parade had been called off . " " That 's right , " Murphy nodded . " The parade was necessary for the second murder scheme . But they did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have it anyway , or somebody else might have suggested it  --  or maybe they all did . Anyway , they all fell right into his plans . " " There 's one thing we must remember , " Farrell reminded them . " The murderer knew the Dis arrangements perfectly . " " I 'll say he did , " nodded Wade . " He knew  --  listen , there 's one man I 'd like to talk to . The fellow who set  | up the ladder . If the ladder Ghent climbed had been closer , and Cynthia had n't had to reach so far out , she might not have leaned on the rail . " " A damn good hunch , " Murphy approved . " We 'll get him . " He pressed the button on the desk and gave quick orders that the man who set up the ladder for the king of Dis be located and brought posthaste to headquarters . " What else are you thinking about ? " he asked as he turned around . " About that balcony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red and black hangings  --  the rail ready to collapse and the drapery hiding the break . Oh , it was beautifully planned . He 's no fool . " Wade sat back and lit another cigarette , watching the smoke curl from the tip . He did not like the job that his friendship for the district attorney had thrust upon him . Years of newspaper work had rid him of a good deal of his native sensitiveness  --  or at least he usually thought it had , until he saw something like that still white thing on the pavement and that horror in the square . He remembered Cynthia as he had seen her last night  --  weak and bitter and jaded , but at the same time beautiful and very appealing , and perhaps bitter because she was fighting something the horror of which she had understood then better than he . He wished he had used more tact , and more sympathy . But after a moment his long training prodded at him  --  this was no time for being sorry . There were things to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know , " he said . " But there 's something we do n't know . We do n't know who this murderer planned to kill besides Cynthia . " Murphy started . " What on earth are you talking about , boy ? You mean we 've got to sit back and wait for more murders ? " " I do n't know , " said Wade . " But look at this . Ghent was hurt . If he had n't fallen on the canopy over his float he 'd have landed on the pavement with her . Did  | the murderer want Ghent out of the way too ? And why ? We 've got to answer that . " " That 's true enough , " Farrell admitted . " And assuming that the man who held the ladder was innocent , what about him ? Suppose he had n't stepped back in time ? Would n't he have been killed too ? " The back of Murphy 's hand rubbed his nose . " But why try to kill them ? " " My idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Farrell . " Ghent made it plain that he and Parnell were n't intimate friends . Parnell threatened him with death last night . " " That checked , did n't it ? " Farrell looked at Murphy . " Sure . Bedclothes burned , Ghent tied up and gagged . Of course he could have fixed all that himself if he was n't level , but we checked the cab companies and found only one cab was called to that address . That cab picked up a masker and took him to Cynthia 's . None of the cab companies took a masker from Cynthia 's to Ghent 's place . So it looks like Parnell was there , and did leave in a cab , just like Ghent said . Far as we can check his story , it 's straight . " " All the same , " said Wade , " I think a little talk with Mr. Ghent might be interesting . Maybe he 's holding back on something he 'd rather we did n't know . We 'd better go at him pretty thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Murphy answered . " They moved him uptown to a private hospital soon as the emergency people at Charity had looked him over . I think the doctors say he 'll be okay in a little while . " " Then I suggest we grill him pretty soon , " said Wade . He began to scratch on a wad of copy paper he had taken from his pocket . " This is the way it shapes up to me . Take Hildreth . There 's always the chance he killed Parnell and doubled back to Baton Rouge , where he got into bed and waited for us to establish his alibi . Then as to Cynthia  --  what about that projected marriage of theirs ? Cynthia could n't marry Hildreth till  | Hildreth was divorced , and if we had any reason to believe she was in the meantime re-establishing an intimacy with Parnell , we 'd have a pretty good case against Hildreth . We know Cynthia was doing Parnell a little favor about that blackmail . And do n't forget that Hildreth and Ghent both have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached that balcony to file the rail without much trouble . " " Well , if you ask me , " said Murphy heavily , " I do n't see where a man 's got such a damn lot of jealousy in him if he 's getting married to a lady that 's already had three husbands . But there 's all sort of people . " Farrell chuckled . " Men have committed murder for women who 've had fifty lovers , Murphy . No , I do n't think we 'd better overlook that motive in Hildreth 's case . And speaking of jealousy , what about Mrs. Hil-dreth ? " " Right , " Wade agreed . " She might have killed Parnell thinking he was Hildreth  --  the number-on-the-suit theory . She was at the Council meeting . She might have seen Cynthia and masker number 47 duck for the pantry , and she might have picked up the knife and gone after them . Suppose she sees Cynthia run out and then sees the man she thinks is her husband unconscious  --  or maybe only dizzy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would n't be hard to stab . " " I thought , " Murphy reminded him , " the nigger said the knife had n't been around for awhile . " " Maybe Cynthia gave it to Hildreth and Mrs. Hildreth thought it would be an ironic instrument . " " And remember , " Farrell added , " the balcony could have been prepared for Cynthia 's death after we discovered the identity of the dead man . Mrs. Hildreth might have broken that rail before daylight this morning . Even though her plan to kill her husband had failed , after all , Cynthia was the one she 'd be after most . " " I guess she figured she could get her husband later , "  | Murphy surmised . He pushed back his chair and stood up . " Lord , boys , " he said wearily , " I wish Cynthia had told us all she knew ! " " So do I , " Wade agreed soberly . " But Cynthia ca n't , now. , , " Do you think , " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parnell ? " " Well  --  either way . Suppose Cynthia knew Mrs. Hildreth had killed Parnell by mistake . From what Cynthia said last night , I gathered that she thought Parnell needed killing . And her knowledge would have given her a club over Mrs. Hildreth that would make Hildreth 's divorce easy . " Murphy plumped himself back into his chair . " How about that note we found among Parnell 's belongings ? Where does that come in ? " " I do n't know , " said Wade . " What about you , Far-rell ? " Farrell smiled hopelessly . " As far as I can see , we can get motives for these murders that will fit half a dozen people . What about Dick Barron ? He lost that money at Parnell 's gambling house , and lost along with it his good name and his father and the girl he was going to marry . If he learned later that the wheels at the Red Cat were crooked , there 's plenty of motive , and a great many juries would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parnell blackmail Esther , there 's another motive . Oh , he could have killed them both . " " But Cynthia 's knife ? " Murphy objected . " That 's not improbable , " Farrell argued . " The butler said the knife had been missing  --  all he means is he had n't seen it around . It might have been anywhere ? in a bookcase , where she had left it after cutting the pages of a new book ; in the guest bedroom ; with the doodads on the whatnot . It 's altogether possible that it was something the killer saw in a flash and picked  | up , in the same fashion that you might pick up a chair in a rough-and-tumble brawl . " " Say , listen , " said Murphy ponderously . " Ai n't you overlooking the chance that the knife was n't the Fontenay knife at all ? " " You mean the one Jasper said Oliver had ? " " Sure . " Murphy got up , his huge frame towering over the other two . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a row about something . We know that Conroy had the money and said he got it from Oliver . Oliver we find on all our checking up is a fine upstanding first-class gentleman . " Murphy 's tone was ironic . " He 's such a fine gentleman that he says never a word about the money at all until Wade pins him clown . Then Oliver 's yarn is that a good fairy gave him the money in the dark and a bad fairy took it away from him . Then he tells another fairy-tale about getting shot . " Murphy struck the table . " Hell ! Why could n't Oliver be in on the Red Cat ? He 's a handy fellow with toys and knows all about springs and electricity . Maybe he fixed up them wheels . You recall that he said he had won the money from Parnell in a private backgammon game ? Private ! " Murphy snorted . " Maybe he was too smart to play in the regular sucker room . " Murphy banged the table . " Maybe Oliver had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got on to it and Oliver paid Conroy the ten grand to keep his mouth shut . Maybe Conroy told Valdon and when Oliver went home with Valdon for a drink Valdon wanted more money to keep quiet and they had a scuffle and Oliver got shot . So he runs home , empties his gun out of the window and tells that tale about being shot by , a housebreaker . " Wade was listening closely . Murphy 's story seemed to fit fairly well . If Oliver had killed Parnell with his own pearl-handled knife , the knife would certainly bring suspicion on Cynthia , or on someone in her house .  | " And remember , " Murphy was adding emphatically , " Conroy told Wade about the money . He was trying to make Oliver take the rap . " " Wait a minute , " Farrell interrupted , " how do you fit the method of murder there ? The knife under the robe ? " " Gripes , " exclaimed Murphy . " You do n't think a guy that invents toys would have such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He leaned closer to Farrell for emphasis . " That guy Oliver would know all about how to file the balcony rail , too . And he 'd know all about Dis . He designed most of their claptrap , did n't he ? " Murphy got up again . " I tell you , boys , Oliver 's my candidate . " Farrell was suddenly hopeful . " What do you want me to do ? " " Hold that squint-eyed , coughing jumping-jack maker as a material witness without bond till I get finished with him . That 's all . I 'll do the rest . " The door of the office swung open . Farrell started indignantly , and then beheld Wiggins ' head poked under a protesting officer 's arms . " Hey , Farrell ! " Wiggins was yelling , " tell this monkey to let me in . It 's important . " " Let him in , " said Farrell with a grin , and as Wiggins struggled through and banged the door Murphy asked " What have you got , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hots , pa-len-ta . And I got it all here . " He marched up to Farrell 's desk and gave Wade a big wink . " I brought ya everything I got . Everything . First , I brought this . " He laid down the red cord with the dark stain . " And then I brought this . " He reached into his inside breast pocket and pulled out an oblong object wrapped in a handkerchief . " Now this , " said Mr. Wiggins , " is a find . "  | " Hurry up , for heaven 's sake ! " Wade exclaimed . " What is it ? " " Now do n't rush me , pal , do n't rush me . " With provoking slowness Wiggins unwrapped his parcel . " You see what it is , do n't you ? " They gasped and started up . On the desk was a knife with a mother-of-pearl handle , in every detail the duplicate of the knife that had killed Roger Parnell . Wade was on his feet . " Where in hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wait a minute , big boy , wait a minute . " Wiggins airily waved his small brown hand . " That ai n't all I brought you . " He marched proudly over to the door and flung it open . Crooking his index finger in a persuasive gesture he turned to his three impatient listeners . " And I brought you this too , " he announced . " Miss Lucy Lake , the smartest girl in town . "  | CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE Lucy came in and stood an instant looking around at Farrell 's austere sanctum and at the men who were waiting there , a trim little figure in a dark blue suit and a little hat that let bright ripples of her hair escape over her cheeks . Her big blue eyes were awed as she watched Murphy pull forward a leather chair and Wade turn over a fresh sheet of copy paper . " Now do n't you be scared , honey , " Wiggins was admonishing with unnecessary warmth . " Just tell ' em where you found it and everything . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farrell asked with interest . " Yes , sir . " Lucy sat down , very tiny in the big chair . " I found it just before I telephoned Mr. Wiggins . " " What time was that ? " " About twenty minutes ago . " " I see . " Farrell gave her an encouraging smile . " You . did quite right to notify us at once . " " I 'm glad I did , Mr. Farrell . I 'd like to do anything I could to help find out who  --  who did that to Miss Cynthia . " " We 're glad you feel that way , and we want you to help us all you can , " he assured her smiling . " Suppose you start by telling us where you found this knife , and how you happened to find it . " " Yes , sir , I will . Mr. Wiggins ? " Lucy gave a bright blue glance to her champion ? " Mr. Wiggins said the knife was important . I found it in a drawer at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to look for ? " There was a break in her voice . Her slim little shoulders steadied themselves with determination , and her hand went up to her lips as if to stifle a sob . " I was looking ? " the words came slowly ? " for some things the undertaker ? "  | Her voice broke again . Wiggins slipped a consoling arm around her . " That 's all right , honey . We know how you feel . Just go ahead and cry if you want to . " Lucy looked up bravely . " There 's no sense in my acting like a baby two months old , " she said , and wiped her eyes . " The knife was under some lingerie in the bottom drawer of that lavender armoire in Mrs. Fontaney 's room , " she said , talking fast as though afraid she might break down again . " Tony had told me there was a lot of questioning about whose knife had killed Mr. Parnell , so the minute I found it I phoned him . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk in Mrs. Fontenay 's sitting room . " " Do you remember when it was lost ? " Wade asked her . " 0 yes . Mrs. Fontenay had me look for it . She asked all the servants about it . It seems it was specially made and very valuable . That was about two weeks ago . " " Had you looked in the drawer where you found it , before today ? " Wade asked . Lucy puckered her forehead . " I did n't look for the knife there , Mr. Wade , but I must have gone into that drawer a dozen times . " " Then I wonder why you had n't seen it before ? " " I do n't know , except that it was at the very bottom of the drawer , under the tissue paper at the back . Just as if it had been hidden away . " " Anyway , " said Farrell with a congratulating smile , " I 'm glad you found it . " He paused a minute . " Now while you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things we 'd like to ask you . You knew Mrs. Fontenay very intimately , and we did n't , and you might be able to tell us something that will help us find out who wanted to kill her . " Lucy 's slim fingers twisted together in her lap . " Mr. Farrell , " she said slowly , " I 'll tell you anything on
