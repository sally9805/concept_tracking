THE JOURNALS OF BRONSON ALCOTT - Edited by Odell Shepard - Little , Brown ( $5 ) . <P> One small but significant event in recent literary history has been the rediscovery of Bronson Alcott . Until two years ago this genial New England philosopher enjoyed an unread celebrity as the father of Louisa May Alcott , a friend of Emerson , one of the least coherent of the Transcendentalists , a slightly daffy but harmless mystic . Glimpses of Alcott in Van Wyck Brooks 's The Flowering of New England exploded these literary myths . Odell Shepard 's Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Alcott , Pedlar 's Progress , gave further proof of their injustice . This week the publication of long sections from Alcott 's journals clears up any remaining doubts about Alcott 's importance . <P> This changed opinion of Alcott reveals a new view of old New England life . One popular biographical sport of the 1920s consisted of picturing Hawthorne , Emerson and their fellows as frustrated Puritans or insipid moralists . But Alcott was so indifferent to worldly success , so unintimidated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that exaggerated picture of the inhibited Yankee . <P> His journal begins in 1826 , when he was teaching school in Connecticut . The first entries are pious and stiff . After he gets involved with the early abolitionists in Boston , marries and comes under the influence of the Rev. Mr. Emerson , he begins to write unselfconsciously and lightly , mixing portraits of his neighbors with reflections on God , literature , teaching , fugitive slaves he sheltered , the punishment of children ( he had come to the painful conclusion that his disobedient daughter Louisa was possessed of the devil ) . <P> Readers of Alcott 's Journals are likely to feel about Alcott much as New Englanders of his day did-first interested , then exasperated , ultimately admiring and fond . Alcott was no parlor philosopher . <P> In a vain attempt to rescue a fugitive slave he charged the Boston courthouse singlehanded , after one man had been killed and while bullets were still flying , thought so little of the act that he barely noted it in his diary . Of sure taste , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowell when they were unknown , made critical appraisals of them which still stand . Readers of his Journals will have no difficulty in seeing why Emerson and Hawthorne praised him so highly , are likely to feel it more puzzling that he has been neglected for so long .
