The People 's Ratty , selling Mennen 's shaving cream , talcum powder , et al . to Sunday afternooners on MBS 's nine-station network , is a weekly cross-patter of sense and nonsense run by veteran Commentator John B. ( for Bright ) Kennedy in a 192-seat theatre 50 stories up in Manhattan 's Chanin Building . The nonsense part is a studio audience participation quizz game called " quixie-doodles " conducted by Comic Bob Hawks . Sample : " Could a baseball game end in a 6-6 tie without a man touching first base ? " Answer : " Yes , if the game was played between two girl teams . " The sense part is a weekly question of public importance , debated earnestly before the microphone and then put before radio listeners at large . <P> Last Sunday 's People 's Rally was important for two reasons : 1 ) it marked Radio Wheelhorse John B. Kennedy 's 15th year on the air ; and 2 ) it sought public opinion on whether the Neutrality Act should be changed to permit shipments of arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirmative on last Sunday 's question , Kennedy picked in- &-out; Liberal Oswald Garrison Villard , was surprised to find Villard an out- &-out; neutrality man . Keeping Villard to say the nays , he then got Nation Correspondent Louis Fischer for the affirmative . <P> Said Fischer : " The Neutrality Act ... is wrong in principle . We sell airplanes to France . . . because we want her to be stronger if attacked by a Fascist aggressor , but we refuse airplanes to Democratic Spain , which has already been attacked by two Fascist aggressors . " Said Villard : " The purpose of this Act is to prevent our being drawn into war . . . . America must stay at peace . Who are we to set ourselves up to judge which side is right and which side is wrong ? " <P> Said 60% of the People 's Rally balloters : The Act should be changed . <P> Real neutrality problem of the People 's Rally any week is keeping Mennen 's out of the argument .

Kaltenborn . His first radio stint took place in 1924 , over WJZ , when he was 30 and associate editor of Collier 's .

His biggest season was 1934-35 when , hired out to Packard , Continental Oil , Lucky Strike and RCA Victor , he collected $100,000 . <P> Quebec-born , of a French Canadian mother and an Irish engineer father , ruddy , grey-maned John B. is 45 , lives comfortably in suburban Larchmont , N. Y. plans to taper off on radio work to devote his time to developing a fictional sleuth to succeed Chesterton 's Father Brown .
