Last week the Greater New York Fund-community chest for 380 Catholic , Protestant , Jewish health and welfare bodies-held a dinner to rally workers . Its 1939 campaign goal : $10,000,000 . Speech of the evening was made by that most coherent of speechmaking bankers , Thomas William Lament . Banker Lament did not speak of sweet charity alone . On his mind was something currently bothering many a man of good will . Said he : <P> " In this campaign of ours we have a strong , practical demonstration of neighborliness and tolerance . How vastly different , by way of contrast , is our situation from that in certain countries overseas where we have been witnessing a racial and religious persecution so cruel as to render life almost intolerable . Is there danger of such racial or religious antipathies crossing the ocean and finding foothold here ? I can not believe it . Yet , from time to time , even in this country , we hear vague , intolerant mutterings . . . . <P> " We all know that America for generations has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we know too that the standard of living has a significance more profound than any mere material term would imply . ... A standard of living , based on a high level because of its spiritual as well as its material wellbeing , can never exist in a nation oppressed with fear , prejudice , racial superstition or religious persecution . . . . " <P> &gt; Up to last week most U. S. Catholic weeklies had ignored an official statement of U. S. bishops deploring " all forms of racial bigotry . " This pronouncement , made in Washington by members of the administrative board of the National Catholic Welfare Conference , was released last April 22 . It was of a policy-making kind which the Catholic press would ordinarily frontpage . Among the few papers which featured it : the Michigan Catholic , St. Paul Wanderer , Buffalo Catholic Union and Times , Pittsburgh Catholic Observer , New York Catholic News .
