THE TRAGEDY or X-Barnaby Ross-Viking ( $2 ) . <P> During its seven-year life the Viking Press has never published a detective story . This criminal negligence the editors are enabled to expiate by the discovery of an " almost perfect mystery . " The Tragedy of X strikes a happy balance : not perfect enough to render its readers completely insomniac , it has points enough to make them lose at least a minimum desired amount of sleep . <P> Dissipated Broker Harley Longstreet , to celebrate his engagement to Cherry Browne , gives a party at a New York Hotel . Longstreet 's business-partner John De Witt , his wife and daughter , six other acquaintances attend . In spite of gin , the party is far from merry since nearly all the guests have particular reasons for hating their host . He invites them to continue the celebration at his West Englewood home . Because of a sudden shower they all board a crosstown trolley-car . Before they have gone two blocks Longstreet falls dead . In his coat pocket is found a ball of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yields nothing to Inspector Thumm and Attorney Bruno . In despair they turn to Drury Lane , a retired actor who had helped them on a criminal case before . Actor Lane is an esthetic Sherlock Holmes who quotes Shakespeare , names his servants after Shakespearean characters , lives in an Elizabethan village of his own creation , takes sunbaths in a breechcloth on an Elizabethan tower . He soon figures out who must have committed the murder , but he has a long way to go to get enough evidence for a legal conviction . Two more murders , an attempted suicide , a backtrack to a murder in South America keep the clues changing like chameleons . With the baffled sleuths , the reader is kept on pins &; needles until Actor Lane , masking himself as dead Broker Longstreet , unmasks the murderer by a logical surprise .
