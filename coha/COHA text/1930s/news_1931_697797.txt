txt Letters to the Editor AMERICAN HUSBANDS . Is Another Lincoln Needed to Free Domestic Slaves ? To the Editor of The New York Times : These women ! I mean , of course , these American women . As if American women were anything different from their European sisters . They are not only very much the same in temperament and in habit as European women , they dress very much the same as most European women . But what strikes me as a European is the amazing ascendency that women here have over their husbands . It is the most striking characteristic of " American life . It not only astonishes the visitor to America , it astonishes the husband himself . Why is the husband not the master of his own household ? The law as it stands today , the law . that relates to the domestic relations between man and wife , that steps in to wegulate the domestic relations of a man 's household , is not only a monstrous and terrible thing , it is an irritating and insulting thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a man to manage his own domestio affairs and destroys the manliness of the husband , and the guiding solicitude of the father . In either capacity of father or husband the law destroys his independence . How many men live with their wives for fear of that same offensive law ? And the irony of the situation is that women demand more " emancipation , " more liberty , more freedom to " express themselves " ! The American husband needs another Lincoln . It Is really a pity to see so many fine specimens of promising manhood crushed and broken by the terrible legal machinery that has been put at the disposal of the American woman . That same woman is fed upon literature of the most silly and idiotic kind , that extols the virtues of the " independent " wife , the " leisurely " wife , the " expressive " wife . They all want to express themselves with the same indelicacy that they want , in many cases , to expose themselves . And the poor American husband dare not open his mouth ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They appeal only to men 's emotions . These facts are so obvious that only a woman would have the hardihood to deny them . This brings us to the point that not only is the American husband a victim of the law , he is a victim of his own emotions . His emotions are exploited , to the questionable advantage of his wife . His capacity as husband and father is exploited by the law , to the unquestionable disadvantage of society . What America needs is not a good fivecent cigar but a sound education in the rigorous art of wife-handling ? man-handling , so to speak . They have " Flag Days " and " Cat Days " and " Dog Days , " and why net a " Husband 's Day , " just as a reminder to himself and to whom it may concern that he is at least part of the domestic equipment , even though he can not claim the same domestic status as his pal of more faithful lineage  --  the dog . Oh , you American husbands ! ? E. B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A Playgrounds Pioneer . To the Editor of The New York Times : Having been related to the recreation movement for many years and an early member of the Playground and Recreation Association , and of its board of directors for several years , I want to express my interest and gratification in THE TIMES editorial of Tuesday , April 14 , on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the recreation association . I should like to call attention to the omission of one name that , in my judgment , should rank very definitely in connection with the original organization and establishment of the Playground Association of America , as it was first known , and that is the name of Dr. Henry S. Curtis , who at that time was the Director of Recreation in the city of Washington and was the first secretary of the Playground and Recreation Association . Both he and Dr. Luther H. Gulick have been my personal friends , and I was rather intimately associated with them at that time , though not an attendant at the first meeting nor a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had t ? , e same inspiration for the organization of this association practically coincidentally with Dr. Gulick , and they were both closely associated in the original plan , Dr. Gulick becoming the president of the new association and Dr. Curtis the secretary . Howard Braucher , the present secretary , succeeded Dr. Curtis in 1909 and Mr. Lee , the present president , succeeded Dr. Gulick in 1910 . Dr. Gulick , to the regret of all who knew him , has passed on . Dr. Curtis was in active work as State Supervisor of Physical Education and Play for the State of Missouri until recently . I trust you will do him the justice and courtesy of publishing this letter . GEORGE W. EHLER . New York , April 23 , 1931 . Cast-Off Clothing Wanted . To the Editor of The New York Times : The Water Street Mission has for fifty-eight years been ministering to men , many of whom are in great need of clothing and food . We ' therefore always have use for men 's clothing of any description . Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning to rid themselves of old clothes , and if so the mission would deeply appreciate it . Any of your readers may advise A. L. Jones , superintendent of the mission , at 316 Water Street , who will be glad to send for such clothing as your friends may plan to dispose of . HENRY FLETCHER , President , Water Street Mission . New York , April 28 , 1931 . A WHITMAN LETTER . A Criticism of Exemption From Military Service Found . To the Editor of The New York Times : In THE TIMES of March 15 , 1863 , Z came across a letter signed W. W. , , which was undoubtedly written by ; Walt Whitman . In spite of its frank criticism of the Quakers and their , attempts to evade the responsibilities of the war , the style and the spirit of the letter point unmistakably to Whitman as ' the author . It is in part a reply to a letter by Clarkson T. ; Collins printed in the issue of March 11 , 1863 , whick protests against the enforcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The Proposed Exemption of Quakers From Military Service . " Whitman , as we know , though he longed for peace , wished to see the war carried through to a successful conclusion . If called , he was ready , to do his duty . He was not a. conscientious objector .. When the draft went into effect he was among the first to register . Had he been called to the colors he would have been ready to shoulder a gun . This letter was written from Washington , where he was serving in the hospitals as a volunteer nurse . He supported himself by contributing war letters to the newspapers of Brooklyn and New York . On March 26 , 1863 , an article of his , " The Great Army of the Sick , " appeared in THE Nswi YOR* ' TIMES . The letter , which I give below , now reprinted , I think , for , the first time , throws an interesting light on Whitman 's attitude toward the Quakers in time of war : " EXEMPTION FROM MILITARY SERVICE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Several articles have appeared MI your paper in reference to the ap ? cation of the conscription law to thei religious society commonly called Quakers . In today 's issue I find one which claims that it would in effect cause persecution by the enemies of the government . It seems to me that there is another phase of the clues. , tion that has not yet been placed in a clear light . The performance 434 military duty is one of the burdens necessarily placed upon the citizens of a country , in order that all may live in peace , and in the enjoyment of property and liberty . Now , eh-. stractly , none ought to be exempt from such a burden . But where truly conscientious scruples exist , it is impossible to enforce it . In such a case as this , where any citizen can . not conscientiously perform a duty ? , which must necessarily be under " taken by some ? is it not plainly just that a larger share of the other bur . dens of government should be laid upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty ? , " I would offer , as an illustration of my meaning , that , in times of peace , a slightly greater ratio of tax .. alma might be imposed upon those who registered their conscientious scruples against military service as a compensation for exemption from that service in times of war . To enforce the conscription law might be persecution ; to remove all liability . without some corresponding disadvantage , would be , not to place Quakers on an equality with other . religious sects , but rather above them , and be offering premium for , the profession of their tenets . " The compensating disadvantage , mentioned above , might not be ac. ceptable to the Quakers ; but , at any rate , it seems to me that their petie tions to be exempt from military , duty would be deserving of far more consideration if they would first , in some authoritative way , take upon themselves , for the ? support of the government , some additonal burden that would not contravene their religious principles . Such a course would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any responsibility ( of which , indeed , there is reason to suspect the great body of that religious community ) and Would Command the respect and attention of all loyal men . " March 11 . W. W. " . I found this letter while engaged in searching for new Whitman material at the Library of Congress . It is a rather important contribution to Whitman lore , as it makes clear a somewhat debatable issue . A few , biographers are inclined to believe that Whitman did not enlist because of the Quaker strain in his blood . In this letter his ideas on the subject are shown in a more explicit fashion , I hope you will tifing it to the atter : ? tion of Whitmad scholars throughout the country by printing it in your Sunday edition . CHARLES I. GLICKSBERG4 Philadelphia , Pa. , April 25 , 1931 . Censored Fiction for Sing Sing , To the Editor of The New York Times : The plea made by your corre ? spondent in today 's TIMES to send fiction to Sing Sing may not be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiction of today and of the past decade having space in the magazines is of a kind not at all adapted to the proper entertainment of the Sing Sing malefactor . I looked over a news stand table filled with papercovered fiction and . counted thirtyeight of them showing highly colored drawings of heroes and bad men in all walks of life and of all coml. tries , each with a gun or other weapon attacking or defending himself , and if that is the kind ' of fiction to be distributed among prison-. ers , I doubt any real kindness back of the act . Indeed , I am of opinion that there 's many an inmate of the various prisons and reformatories throughout the country who received his inspiration from just such vicious sources . Fiction to the prisoners , yes  --  but only such as has passed the strictest censorship and is in every way . worthy , and I sadly doubt that kind would be at all welcome . " GO SLOW .
