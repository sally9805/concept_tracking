CAUGHT in the whirling teeth of a machine , the hand of a workman was badly injured in a Chicago factory a few months ago . The machinist was rushed to the hospital for treatment , and a claim was put in for accident insurance . Three days later , a clerk in a New York insurance office unwrapped a package mailed from Chicago . Out dropped a hand with three fingers missing and an ugly scar across the palm . With this as proof of injury , the insurance was paid , and the hand was stored away for future reference . The hand , however , was not made of flesh and bone , but of an amazing substance known as moulage ? a waxlike modeling preparation with which even an untrained user can make a realistic duplicate of a finger , a face , a lizard , a potato , or a footprint . An ultramodern improvement over wax and plaster of Paris , it remained virtually unknown until scientific detectives found it an ideal medium for preserving perishable clews . Today , anyone can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hobbyists , and scientists are daily discovering new and novel applications for the versatile material . Moulage has even found its way into the kits of explorers . Traveling through faraway Irak in Asia Minor , not long ago , a noted archaeologist came upon an unusual set of rock carvings adorning the facade of a ruined temple . To take the wall apart and bring it home was impossible , so he did the next-best thing . He photographed it , and then , section by section , made a moulage cast of the intricate stonework , tinted it to imitate the color of the actual stone , and shipped it to the United States . At about the same time , scientists at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City were faced with the problem of mounting a giant skull on a dinosaur skeleton . Filled with solid rock and weighing more than two tons , it was too heavy to be suspended in mid-air . Experts solved the problem by preparing a lightweight duplicate in moulage to be attached to the long neck of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near-by cabinet , is now on display for those who wish to examine it . Moulage takes its name from the French word for " molding . " Its inventor , Dr. Alphonse Poller of Vienna , Austria , developed it primarily for making intricate casts of portions of the human body to serve as models for his classes in anatomy . In this country , however , moulage made its debut as an aid in fighting crooks . First introduced at the Scientific Crime Laboratory of Northwestern University , a few years ago , it is employed today by virtually every first-class police department . Victims of hit-and-run drivers and of gang violence have been identified , long after burial , by means of moulage death masks . Footprints in the mud , jimmy marks on window sash , automobiletire tracks , and even tooth marks in a half-eaten apple have been preserved in moulage and used in solving baffling crimes . One of the strangest police uses of moulage followed the recent discovery of the legs of a woman , severed from the body , in Boston harbor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the identity of the victim was a mystery . Making the most of their slender clew , the Boston police took casts in moulage of the legs and feet . Then , in a grim sort of Cinderella test , they tried fitting the moulage feet to the shoes of girls known to be missing . Their search ended in a home near Boston , where shoes that matched the casts exactly , identified the woman . In a recent manslaughter cam ! reported from Los Angel Calif. , a moulage cast helped to convict a hit-and-run driver . A broken fragment from the tip of an automobile bumpet was the only evidence found at the spot where the victim had been killed . From this piece , police made a moulage cast , duplicating the end of the bumper that they believed remained on the car . A check-up of all cars with damaged bumpers led to a machine with one that matched the cast . Confronted with the evidence . the guilty driver confessed and was sentenced . More in line with the original application of moulage ? making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current uses in the hands of doctors and surgeons . When an elderly woman in a small western town broke her leg , not long ago , her doctor found that she needed a brace of an unusual type . There was only one place to secure it ? from an eastern firm that specialized in such devices . The doctor  | aught aid from the local police department , which used moulage . A cast of the : oken leg was made with the material , : id shipped east , where the supply firm fitted a perfect brace . Orthopedists often encounter cases in which patients must have shoes made to order by a distant firm , but lack the time r money for the trip . The problem is solved by making a moulage cast of the cot and shipping it to the shoe manufacturer . Eye specialists also are taking advantage of moulage for the ticklish task of fitting the new-style invisible or " conact " eyeglasses ? tiny curved disks of glass that rest directly on the eyeball . To guard against twitching and discomfort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye . The warm moulage is then poured directly over the eyeball . A cast from the resulting mold enables an expert to insure a comfortable fit for the lens . The same advantages that moulage exhibits in specialized uses like these make it an all-around modeling aid of practically universal application . So simple is it to apply that school children are using it . Flexible and resilient even after it has cooled , the waxlike material gives to permit an object to be withdrawn from the mold , like a hand from a glove . Thus seamless , one-piece casts may be made of objects that would have to be cast in sections with other modeling materials . Since the final reproductions are not solid masses but thin shells , even large casts are not cumbersome in weight . When reenforced , they are virtually unbreakable . FOR collectors and home craftsmen , moulage offers unlimited possibilities . One amateur , a Morrisville , Pa. , nurseryman , makes a hobby of collecting mushrooms , toadstools , and other fungous growths . Last summer , during a trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found . The novel collection proved so interesting that it recently was placed on exhibition in the Franklin Institute of Science at Philadelphia . Anyone who has ever examined the intricate markings on the underside of a toadstool knows how delicate they are , yet the moulage casts reproduced them accurately . Most fascinating of all the amateur diversions that moulage provides , however , is home sculpture . Heretofore , only the well-to-do could afford to have masks or busts made . Now you can make likenesses of yourself , your relatives , and your friends , at small cost and by a simple method . How this is done offers a good illustration of the technique of using moulage . The dealer supplies the material in three slightly different forms . You use the first to make a " negative " or reverse mold , brush the second into it to obtain a " positive " reproduction , and reenforce the thin cast that results with a layer of the third . When you are ready to make a life mask from a living subject , your first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by heating it gently with water . At a temperature low enough to cause no discomfort to the skin , it takes on a creamy consistency and may be brushed right over the face . No greasing , oiling , or other preparation is needed , for moulage does not stick to the skin , or even to the hair . A cardboard mask with an oval hole , cut to fit the subject 's head , serves as a base for the mask  | and catches any drippings . Soda straws in his nostrils enable him to breathe while you apply thin layers of the material , one by one , over a rough frame fashioned of wire to support it . When the last has hardened , which takes but a short time , the solidified mold is grasped at the edges and carefully lifted off . It bears the imprint of every detail of the subject 's features . Next you melt up a small quantity of the " positive " material , an opaque , waxlike substance supplied in tints to match various shades of complexion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mold to form a thin shell . When it has set , it is backed with the reenforcing plastic . Remove the cast from the mold , and you will have a likeness of photographic quality that will endure through the years . I F A hobbyist chooses , he can enhance the appearance of the mask by hand-carving the eyes open , by gluing on real hair to represent eyelashes and eyebrows , and by tinting with oil colors . Since " positive " moulage takes electroplating , the finished mask may be given a striking appearance with a coating of silver or of copper . Suppose you want to present masks of yourself to each of half a dozen relatives . You need make only one " negative " mold . The six " positives " are then cast in turn ; as each one is withdrawn , a dipping in water is the only preparation that the mold needs before the next casting . When the " negative " mold has served its purpose , it is broken up and the material is used over again . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important point . Four pounds of the " negative " plastic , enough to make a face mask , costs from six to twelve dollars . The same material may be melted down and used again from 100 to 300 times however , reducing the cost of a single " negative " mold to a few pennies . The " positive " material is cheaper by the pound and much less of it is required , so the total cost of a face mask amounts to less than a dollar . Even the initial expense for materials becomes moderate when it is shared by a group of hobbyists . A still more modest start may be made with a two-pound can of the material , enough to cast a human hand or a small statue , and many beginners acquire practice in this way before going on to more ambitious projects . Starting in a small way from its invention a few years ago , moulage has made a permanent and valued place for itself in the realms of science , art , and industry . Now , with its increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon be performing many new and as yet undiscovered tasks in aid of science .  |
