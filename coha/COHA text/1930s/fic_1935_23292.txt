THE PERFECT PERRIERS A STORY BY PHILIP CURTISS F VERYBODY who met the Perriers i liked them at sight and the more one saw of them the better one liked them ; but there were times when even their best friends found them curiously exasperating . Bob MacGregor expressed it openly one hot September afternoon , as August Perrier and he were sitting on the shaded brick terrace which lay at the 3arden end of the Perriers ' remodeled farmhouse . " Do you know , Gus , " he complained , ' that you and Helen are awfully dis-:ouraging people to Live in the same : own with ? You 're so damnably perfect . Sylvia and I wake up in the ' Horning full of life and ambition and rowded with pious thoughts . Then , likely as not , we go down into the kitchen , find that the range has gone Jut and that we ca n't have any breakfast . So we stoke it up again with Hoken boxes or throw together a little aurnt toast on the open fireplace , but : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find that one of the children has pushed the other off the shed roof or ; something . By the time that 's fixed .. tp I go out to do a little work in my studio and discover that I have n't any Chinese white and ca n't get any with-nit sending to New York . So I start : ooling round with some old canvasas and just get a big idea for a picture bat has been troubling me for days Jut Sylvia comes rushing out and tellsme that a tribe of red ants has worked from the pantry up into the storeroom and is eating all the paraffine off her best preserves . " So then , after smoking out the ants and stopping three more fights between the children and getting a telegram from Chicago from someone who wants to find my sister 's address on Cape Cod ? and after being obliged to telephone twice to Boston and once to New York before I can find out what her address is , myself  --  and after the woodman has come in the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I discover that it 's the wrong size , and after Sylvia and I have got into a fight that will keep us barely on speaking terms for a week  --  then I come over here and know with absolute certainty just what I shall find . " I know that every blade of grass in your lawns will be mowed and every hedge trimmed to a hairline . I know that you will he sitting here , cool and comfortable , looking like a major of British cavalry on leave in Singapore . I know that if you want a drink or a cup of tea it will suddenly appear on a perfect silver tray with a neat little napkin folded in just the right folds . know that if we go out to the stables you will have a stunning new chestnut mare that looks like a million dollars but that you really picked up yesterday afternoon for a hundred and a quarter . I know that if He/en should call out of an upper window to ask where you put a wooden collar button left by your Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe out of your mouth and say , ' It 's in the fourth drawer from the right , dearie , in the second bureau on the lefthand side . ' And I know that if Franklin D. Roosevelt were to telephone you this minute and say , ' Mr. Perrier , the country has reached its last gasp and you 've got to pull it together again : you would merely answer , ' All that has been taken care of , Mr. Roosevelt , I 'll drop a line to the proper people and tell them to go ahead . ' " August Perrier laughed . " That 's very flattering . I only wish it were so . " " But , hang it , it is so , " insisted Bob . He waved his hand to include the lawns , the hedges , the nodding , delicately colored flower beds , and the distant white paddock fences , which were all in about the condition that he had described . " It is n't just the fact that you have some money and I have none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose , more money than anyone else in West Gosset but he and Molly are constantly in the same stew that Sylvia and I are in . No , Gus , it 's something about you that always makes things fall exactly right . If the rest of us are caught by a coal strike we find that you filled your bin eight months before . On the other hand , if a new kind of scab hits the potato crop we discover that you did n't plant any potatoes that year . " And it is n't just lawns and gardens and tea trays and things of that kind , " continued MacGregor . " You always seem to know all sorts of things that nobody else knows . For example , I see a review of a new book in the Sunday paper and say to myself , TlI have to read that sometime . ' I come over here the same afternoon and invariably find the book itself , all fresh and new , lying on your library table . Or per haps a bunch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone ask , ' What 's that he 's playing now ? And nobody will know until we asi you or Helen and you will say , in casual voice , ' Is n't it Misinsky 's what do-you-call-it in B minor ? ' " But the most maddening thing that you 're never away from West Gos set ten days a year , yet you always seen to know everybody on earth . Sylvia or Molly Payson or Margaret Dodgt will meet some marvellous new peoph in Barringford or Stanwix and plan dinner to burst them on the world But when they tell you or Helen about it you merely say , ' The Stewart Vail Deusens ? Oh , yes , they 're very amus ' ing . Their mother was a sister of m ) uncle 's second wife . ' And by jimin ) it 's always true . But how do you do it , Gus ? How does a person get that way ? " It was typical of August Perrier  --  am also perhaps typical of all that Mac Gregor had been saying about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced , foolish denials . Neither did h turn the whole question aside with some chance jocosity . Instead , h ( drew thoughtfully at his pipe for sev oral seconds , as if the whole matter di indeed present an interesting and quit impersonal problem . " Did it ever occur to you , Bob , " II ( asked at last , " that almost anyone can do a job fairly well if he picks one that is small enough ? " MacGregor shot at him a look of sudden , amused appreciation . That was another amazing thing about August Perrier  --  that the answer he gave to a given question was alwa satisfactory but never quite the on that had been expected . " Then you would say ? ? " suggested MacGregor . " Exactly what anyone would say if he cared to think about it , " replied Perrier . " Given a modest amount of means , a few natural inclinations and plenty of time , is there anything so marvellous in keeping up a house , a small stable , and a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family had lived for two or three generations in Berkfield County , would n't it be strange if you did n't know most of the people in it ? If you never painted a picture , wrote a book , or played a note of music , but spent all your time looking at other people 's pictures , reading other people 's books , and listening to other people 's music , could n't you also give the impression that you had covered a good deal of ground ? " " I see what you mean , " admitted MacGregor , " but I still do n't believe that that wholly explains it . With all the money and all the time in the world I could never make a place look as yours does . And Sylvia , bless her heart , could never run a house the way Helen does . " He grinned . " I can see it now ! The children would be putting white rats in all the guest-room beds and cleaning their skis with the tea napkins . " " Well , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely the point . Painting pictures and bringing up children is your principal job . All the rest of it , house , grounds , reading books , and knowing your neighbors , is purely secondary . But with Helen and me those things are full time . So is it strange that I know when a new disease is attacking my apple trees , but that you do n't even think of it until the leaves begin to drop off ? " " I suppose so , " nodded MacGregor , not quite convinced . He leaned back in his deck chair , looked vaguely round , as if some object in the landscape might give him a new point of attack ; but while he hesitated the slow toll of a bell came across the meadows from the church tower in the village , a full mile to the eastward . MacGregor leaped to his feet . " For the love of Sam Talinadgel Six o'clock ? And I promised . Sylvia that I 'd pick up the kids at the lake at quarter-past five . " Perrier looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a bit of cheer and refreshment before you go ? " " No , thank you , " answered Bob . " I have n't got time . Not even with a silver tray and a folded napkin . " A moment later his rickety , open car could be heard rattling down the short driveway to the road . then , having passed round a low rise in the ground , could be seen for a few hundred yards on the highway , Bob driving in the same manner in which he talked , with his mussed hair flying , his big shoulders hunched , and his hands and feet doing twice as much as was necessary . The car had hardly disappeared when Helen Perrier came out from the dim , low-ceilinged living room which opened on the terrace . In actual age she was probably fifteen or sixteen years younger than her husband ; but that was still another strange point about the Perriers  --  that no one ever noticed the difference between them . Three days after her marriage Helen had seemed to spring into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that point while Perrier himself was one of those weather-beaten , sailing-master-like men who appear precisely the same during a large part of their lifetimes . Absently Helen glanced over the terrace , picked up a burnt paper match from the bricks and put it in an ash tray . She straightened the chair which the visitor had occupied , then seated herself in another , nearer to her husband . " What was Bob MacGregor raving and ranting about ? " she asked . Perrier shrugged slightly . " Oh , the same old story . It seems to amuse Bob and at the same time slightly irritate him that we keep our lawns properly cut and wash our faces almost every morning . " " I know , " replied Helen . " I do wish people would stop talking about that for a while . " Her husband turned quickly . " Has anyone been talking about it , except Bob ? " " Oh , no , not exactly in so many words , but you know how it is with almost everyone who comes here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a typical feminine summer visitor . " ' Oh , Mrs. Perrier , I 've heard such marvellous things about your charming old house  --  everything is so exactly right  --  such adorable atmos-phere ! ' " And also , " continued Helen , resuming her natural voice , " Margaret Dodge has been giving me one or two nasty little digs lately . She asked me the other day whether I had never in my life felt the slightest desire to kick over the lamp , paint my face , and elope with a bus driver . " " Margaret , " remarked Perrier , " is a type of girl that seems to have been only partially grasped by the modern commentators . She likes to dress like a rope dancer ; her talk is somewhat lower than that of the average stableman , but in reality she is primmer than a New England schoolma'am and more snobbish than oldfashioned Newport . My heart goes out to any young man who tries to take her at her face value . " The comment was true enough but Helen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moody silence , while the shadows of the house , growing cooler as they advanced , crept past them , out over the lawn , and the whole scene before them  --  the meadows , the thick line of trees at the village , and the distant , pastured hills  --  began to assume the still , **25;314;TOOLONG appearance that all nature seemsto take on at sunset . A buckboard with a clopping gray horse appeared for a moment on the small space of visible highway ; a hawk , flying low , began to circle above the line of the brook in a bit of swampland , then circled upward again and disappeared toward the roadway . A chimelike sound , as of some heavy metal struck with a hammer , came faintly and musically from some unknown quarter ; then all was silent again except for the regular , pre-autumn chirping of the crickets . Helen stirred at last . " But , Gus , " she demanded , " do you suppose that we really are like that ? Have we become just a pair of prigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and missing nine-tenths of what most people find in life ? " Somewhat below his usual form , Perrier fell back on the traditional husband 's answer . " But what would you suggest ? " he asked . " It is rather late for me to become one of America 's leading painters , like Bob MacGregor . And as for starting a steel foundry or something , this would hardly seem to be the ideal moment . " " Oh , I do n't know exactly what I do mean , " admitted Helen . " Personally I do n't want to do anything different . I love everything just as it is now . But still I wonder ? " A maid had appeared at the entrance to the living room , one of those gray-haired , gentle-voiced maids that one would have expected to find in a house like the Perriers ' . She waited decorously to make sure that Helen 's sentence was not to he finished , then opened the screen door . " Mrs. Perrier , Mrs. Payson has telephoned to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She says not to hurry . " " Oh , good heavens ! " exclaimed Helen , half starting from her chair . " I 'd forgotten completely about Molly 's dinner . That extra half hour will just save our lives . " Her husband looked at her with sudden amusement . " A Perrier has forgotten a thing like a dinner engagement ? Can that possibly mean that we 've begun to slip ? " As a matter of fact they could have slipped far worse than that and still have attracted no attention , for the dinner proved to be a small , neighborhood affair at which anyone might have been late . The Paysons ' house was a large , semi-modern sort of villa at the other side of the town , on a high hill overlooking the lake , an architect 's dream of the year 1897 to which time and pleasant associations had given a certain elephantine charm . As Perrier followed Helen into the heavily hung library where cocktails were being served , he was conscious at first of only the faces that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoutish and somewhat pathetic young man who always looked rather helpless in the presence of his wife , Molly Payson , a bustling and exceedingly smart young woman who , without the least intention of doing so , inevitably succeeded in casting , her husband into the shade , and Bob MacGregor , looking quite as mussed and badly dressed in his dinner jacket as he had looked that afternoon in his working shirt and khaki trousers . Then suddenly , through the cigarette smoke and the clatter , Perrier was conscious of a pair of very dark , very large eyes looking fixedly at him from a dim corner of the room and of a figure like that of some Medici princess . For a second he was seized by a queer , excited feeling , but abruptly he found himself laughing inwardly , laughing , in the first place , because he had allowed himself to feel that way and , in the second place , because he had failed to recognize that the eyes and the figure were only those of young Margaret Dodge . The next moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room , a ribald wink from Bob MacGregor and a sudden stiffening of Helen 's shoulders , that he was not the only one whom Margaret Dodge had sent a bit reeling ; for while everyone present had known her casually for two or three months , no one had ever before seen her dressed  --  no one had ever seen anyone in West Gosset dressed  --  as she was dressed this evening . A tall , dark , and rather broad shouldered girl of twenty-two or - three , her eyes were heavily made up and her hair was arranged in a way that suggested someone like Cleopatra . Her dark velvet gown was cut fantastically low , long black pendants hung from her ears , and a serpentine , gold , Greek bracelet weighted down one forearm . The whole effect was Byzantine , Bulgarian , or plain Monte Carlo , whichever one wanted to call it , and theoretically it should have been awful . But curiously it was n't . It was stunning , and nobody knew it better than Margaret herself , who still stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long cigarette holder between the fingers of one hand and a cocktail glass , poised rakishly , in the other . Behind his shoulder Perrier heard Molly Payson , under pretense of passing hors d'oeuvres , murmuring to Helen how it had happened . Sylvia MacGregor , Bob 's wife , had not been able to come ( possibly as a sequel to the red ants ) so at the last minute the hour of the dinner had been put back and Margaret asked to fill in . With this fair statement of the facts , Helen honestly tried to do her part and be big about the matter , waving a hand gayly across the room to Margaret yet not prolonging the greeting to such an extent that a certain slight reserve would not still be visible . Catching also the suspicion that an effort more vigorous than usual would be needed to make this party a success , Andy Payson began circling the room with a refilled shaker , while Bob MacGregor , who had come early and who was never judicious about cocktails , headed suddenly for Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be very daring and Latin  --  quartery . To all of this Margaret herself responded only with the same amused detachment with which she had greeted the more aghast atmosphere of a few minutes before . A quarter of a generation younger than anyone else in the room , she realized that she had them all guessing and was having the time of her life about it . To Helen 's greeting she replied with a wave of her own which accepted the older woman 's cordiality and ignored her reserve . To Andy 's outreached shaker she laughingly shook her head , while Bob MacGregor 's bumbling advances she so quietly but effectively snubbed that she left the poor fellow bewildered . Yet , oddly , every time that August Perrier looked in her direction be found her large , dark eyes gazing squarely and provocatively at him . Considering its scratchy start , the dinner went off amazingly well . As if satisfied that she had created consternation enough for one evening , Margaret completely relaxed , became once more just the wellbred , modern-country-house type of girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions with amusing , modest replies ; but after coffee had been served in what in that house was still called " the drawing-room " things began to start up again . Bob MacGregor , whose eager hands and feet could never long remain quiet , began clamoring for a table of bridge ; but since there were six of them , August Perrier , who detested cards of any kind , ruled himself out . Lighting a cigar , he opened one of the long Frenchwindows and stepped out on the veranda , closing the window behind him again . The cut for places also put Margaret Dodge on the side-lines for the first rubber so , still retaining her modest-young-miss manner , she picked up a book and turned on a reading light over an easy chair , while the players at the table settled almost immediately into the concentrated silences , the curt , monosyllabic questions , and the occasional insulting outbursts of four persons who have played together for years . For perhaps a quarter of an hour this continued until , in the clatter of di @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious that Margaret Dodge had risen quietly fro her chair , had stepped out through the same French window through which Perrier had passed , and was now soft/ closing it behind her . Bob MacGregor , who had finished sorting his new hand , looked up in time to catch both the act and Helen 's expression . " Better look out , Helen , " he warned . " For all you know , there goes the Fall of the House of Usher . " Helen answered nothing but the slightly vicious way in which she fan-shaped her cards , glanced at them , and then slid them together again showed that she had heard perfectly . " Two hearts , " she murmured . MacGregor roared and Helen flushed scarlet . " If I were you , " chuckled Bob , " I 'd make it one club . " " What in the world are you talking about ? " demanded Molly Payson , who was sitting with her back to the window and had missed the whole thing . " Oh , nothing , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidents that lighten our dull country lives . " Outside in the darkness of the veranda August Perrier was standing at the far end of the railing , looking out into the night . At the click of the opening French window he turned and , for the second time that evening , a queer , darting feeling went through him . This time , however , he was more prepared . " Oh , hello , " he said , casually . " Not in the game ? " Margaret did not answer directly but , passing through the shaft of light from the windows , joined him in the shadows at the railing . " What were you looking at so intently ? " she asked . " A thing of no importance whatever , " replied Perrier . He pointed with his hand . " I presume that I have stood on this veranda several hundred times but I never noticed before that there is one spot , away down there in the valley , where you can see the lights of the cars on the Lebanon road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where ? Let me see it , " exclaimed Margaret , pushing up with apparent eagerness . " Down there , " repeated Perrier . " Look just a little to the right of the church tower , toward Gosset Mountain , In a minute you 'll see a faint flash . " " Oh yes , I see it now , " said the girl , slowly . For a minute or two she watched intently , politely giving the phenomenon the attention it deserved , but presently her eyes turned to a nearer point at the foot of the lawn  --  where the glow of a boathouse Tamp , ' reflected in the water , showed the dark presence of the lake . Perrier , however , realized that she still remained standing extremely close to him , her ' scented shoulder pressing frankly against the sleeve of his coat . A thought , half alarming , half entertaining , shot through Perrier 's mind . " Just what , " he asked himself , " is this infant trying to do ? " fIn order to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it was while Margaret did the same . For several seconds they stood , as it were , in a mental and strategical deadlock , then , almost with a gesture of impatience , the girl moved away . " Gus , " she demanded , turning squarely toward him , " why do you dislike me so ? " " But I do n't , " protested Perrier . " Oh , yes you do , " insisted Margaret , " and you express it in the one way that can make me furious . You are always laughing at me , behind those calm , handsome , gray eyes of yours . Is n't there anything on earth that can shake you out of your cool , safe detachment ? " " That 's odd , " replied Perrier . ' ' You are the second person  --  no , the third  --  who has asked me that question today . I 'm beginning to believe that I must be a most detestable individual . " Margaret put out her hand and rested it on his arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at times you really are maddening . What I mean is do n't you ever feel a desire to jump , yell , and be thoroughly human ? " " I did about an hour ago , " confessed Perrier , " when I saw you in that dress . " Margaret laughed . " That was silly of me but I wanted to raise hell tonight . I was so sick of everything , sick of being dragged around from place to place by a hypochondriac mother who does nothing but talk about her headaches and about the shrinking of her investments and how we are sure to end up in the poorhouse . I was so sick of men who think about nothing except golf scores and the N.R.A . and of summer-resort boys whose idea of humor is to say , ' Oh yeah ? ' I was  --  I might as well say it  --  I was sick of all you in the young married crowd who seem so safe and so sure and always know just what you are going to do every day . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to myself , ' All right , I 'll go . /II shove a stick of dynamite under their tails and then watch their faces . ' " " Well , you certainly did it , " laughed Perrier . " I did , " agreed Margaret , " until you came into the room and then I felt about three inches high . You made me feel like the jackass that you always make me feel when I 'm doing something silly . " Swiftly the girl looked over her shoulder to make sure that no one was moving behind the lighted windows . She tightened her grasp on Perrier 's arm . " Listen , Gus , " she said . " There 's something I 've got to say to you and I may never get the chance again . You 're the one person in West Gosset that I 've really wanted to talk to all summer . I hate you for it  --  and it makes me mad every time I look at you  --  but , damn you , you are the real thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these crazy , ultra modern youngsters . " For a moment Perrier did not reply but , seeing that she really was waiting for an answer , he spoke at last , slowly : " No , Margaret , that is not the way that I look at you . " He smiled . " If you want the real truth , the thing that has always perplexed me about you is that , under your modernism , under your love of dash and profanity , I get , every now and then , grotesque glimpses of a very different sort of person . " The girl looked at him with slow , dawning suspicion and her grasp on his forearm perceptibly slackened . " What kind of person ? " she demanded cautiously . " That 's a little difficult to say , " replied Perrier . " A slight dash , perhaps , of Miss Porter 's School , certain vague echoes of Old South Church in Boston , and a very big dose of the late Mrs. Astor . This is what I mean , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a room , put your feet up on a chair and talk like James Joyce unexpurgated . But let someone else try it , someone you do n't like , Bob Mac-Gregor for example , and instantly yot freeze up and silence him like Queer Victoria . " The girl drew her hand entirely ' from his arm and turned slightly away " Do you know , " she answered , " tha nothing you could have said could have hurt me more than that ? Then yot think my modernism is just put on ? " " Oh , not at all , " protested Perrier " On the contrary I find the combina tion very piquant . But I 've often thought that your friends in general must find you a little puzzling to deal with . What happens , for instance , when they approach you in your Jot Penner mood and find that you 've sud. denly changed to the Duchess of Chi chester ? " " Nothing happens , " replied Mar garet , soberly . " In fact that 's just th trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to be enigmatic that Perrier did not even offer a guess as td their meaning . Only when she seemed determined to stand indefinitely in a half sulky silence did he make a peace gesture . " I 'm sorry if I 've misunderstood you . " The girl did not turn . Neither di she lift her voice above a studied m notonousness . " You did n't misunder-. stand me , " she answered . " In fact you 're quite right . I suppose that 's why I 've always been a little afraid of . you . " She tried silence again , looking/ down toward the boathouse , then burst out abruptly , " You 've said it exactly . 1 am a funny combination of a prude and a bawd . When one mood is on ' me it seems perfectly natural but then , without warning , the other mood will rise up and kick it in the neck . When I am with proper people I feel pos-sessed to talk and act like a barge hand , but when I 'm thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very Junior League . " " That 's perfectly human , " admitted NTier . He studied her closely for a oment or two then took a step toward T. This time it was his hand that sted on her shoulder . " Look here , argaret . Why do n't you come right it with it ? You 're in a mess . " The girl started back but , meeting Lai the rail , both hands went autoarically behind her and she caught rself . " How did you know ? " she gasped . " It 's a man , is n't it ? " The girl bowed her head but still , in e darkness , her whole outline reained tense and theatric . " What other kind of mess is there , " e asked , " for a person of my sort ?

" Yes , I d have something , " she admitted , ' ut I hardly thought you 'd leap out id tell me first . " i " Was that so difficult ? " asked Per-2r . " As you say yourself , when a ri of your age is in some sort of fix s usually of one kind . " He paused , en asked , " And the man in the case is arried to someone else ?

" Margaret glanced toward the lighted windows , then back at Perrier . " That 's just the question . Am I or am I not ? I was going to ask you if you had n't broken in . " " Ask me ? " demanded Perrier . " How should I know ? " " Welt , for one thing , " replied Margaret , " you have lived a year or two longer than I have and you happen to be about the only person around here who is neither a roustabout nor a frump . I told you I have wanted to talk to you for weeks and , now that I have tried it , you have been rather miraculous . You seem to divine everything . " She suddenly looked up at him with what was a genuine smile . " Please , " she begged . " I really am sick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ? " Perrier stepped slowly to the rail and stood looking down the dark valley . " Miracles , " he answered , " are apt to be disappointing . After they are over you always see that they were merely what was bound to happen anyway . " " And you mean by that , " asked Margaret , " that I am not going to run away ? " " I 'm afraid I do , " replied Perrier . " Because you think ? " " What I said before  --  that at heart you are simply not that kind of a per-son . " Margaret made no protest . Instead she remained , still leaning on the rail , in a listless silence . " And that is all you can say ? " she asked at last . " If you want the truth , " replied Perrier . " Oh , I suppose it 's the truth all right , " admitted Margaret . " But , Gus , " she demanded suddenly , " why have I got to be that sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why have I got to keep on being it ? " " Because , unhappily , " answered Perrier , " there is a very old theory about a leopard and his spots . I have seen people who tried to disprove it but never one who succeeded . Besides , there are other things to consider . For example  --  the man . " " Oh , you need n't worry about him , " exclaimed Margaret , promptly . " He 's been living for years in a worse hell than this could ever bring him . " " You mean  --  his wife ? " The girl looked up at him quickly , suspiciously , but Perrier was standing in perfect calm . " Yes , his wife , " replied Margaret . " She is the world 's most despicable example of the word ' woman . ' She has n't lived with him for years . She 's treated him like a toad , run around with every Torn , Dick , and Harry . There are n't any children  --  if that 's what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or most of it . She would n't suffer . " " And yet , " suggested Perrier , " she does n't want a divorce . " " Exactly , " agreed Margaret . " He offered it to her years ago  --  long before I ever came on the scene  --  and she wo n't even listen . " " There are women like that , " mused Perrier . " Sometimes the man has a name that means something in his part of the world and the wife knows its value . She does n't really care for him . As you say , she does n't want to live with him , but still she does n't want to be known as Mrs. Somebody Else . " " And that 's precisely what 's happened in this case , " exclaimed Margaret . She suddenly turned . " Really , Gus , you are a wonder . I 'm beginning to think that you 're telling this story . " " Oh , no , I 'm not . " replied Perrier . " It 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that I want to know . " anything at all , " answered Margari " Yet , Gus , why should n't I ? You s the facts and I think that , in spite yourself , you sympathize .

And the rest of the world wou soon forget all about it . We 've talk , it over and over and it all seems reasonable . But the fact remains th when I come to the point I just simp ca n't do it . " " Well , after all , Margaret , " beg : Perrier , but the girl interrupted him " Oh , I know what you 're going say , " she protested . " Spirit of my cestors  --  Old South Church in Bost ? all that sort of thing . But , Gus , is n't that . It 's simply that I 'm afra You think that my modernism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' done lots of things that my mo would never have done , that proba you would n't do yourself , and th have n't hurt me a particle . Yet wh I come to this one big thing I 'm no ing but a coward . " " And so , " suggested Perrier , " " are trying to make yourself do it because you 're afraid to . " " Well , not exactly that , " protestt Margaret , " but it 's only my oldfas ioned Presbyterian cowardice tho keeps us from doing it . " " 1 still wonder whether that 's true mused Perrier . He stood a moue ) looking down at the lawn , then turm back , facing her . " Have you , by as chance , ever thought of this ? My gu is that the man in question , in spite all that his wife has done , has still ke himself fairly decent . " Margaret nodded . " You 're rig again . I suppose I should n't like hi if he had n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his courage , " continued Perri would n't it be rather foolish at this to date for him to do just what his de has been doing right along ? Would n't that be playing squarely into er hands ? " " Oh , yes , theoretically , I suppose it ould , " agreed Margaret . " But has e got to stay locked in a prison , as it ere , while she goes around and does rery thing she pleases ? And have I ) t to give up the one thing I want Lost in life ? " " Not necessarily , " answered Perrier . But it might be a very tragic thing if ? and you  --  were to dig yourselves ainfully out of prison and possibly get mrselves shot in the back while you ere doing it , only to discover that a gal pardon was coming the very next ay . " The girl looked up at him with widepened eyes . " Just what do you Lean ? " Perrier hesitated . " This man , " he cut on , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years older an I am . " " And he married very young ? " " You would guess that ! Yes , before was twenty . She trapped him into PP " Then perhaps he may have older lends who understand the situation . ; hey may be taking steps to get him at of it . " The girl stared at him for a moment , ien leaped to her feet . " Gus Perrier , D you mean to say that you actually now who he is ? " Perrier shrugged his shoulders . " I 'll sk a guess . It 's Charley Foote over Southbridge . " The girl 's hands dropped to her side . You 're absolutely marvellous ! " Perrier smiled but did not answer . " But does anyone else know ? " deJanda ' Margaret . " Does Helen know nd all that crowd in there ? " " How could they ? " answered Perer . " I did n't know myself . I was only guessing . I 'm sure that there has n't been a syllable breathed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've taken , " replied Margaret , " to make sure that there would n't be . " She considered , thoughtfully . " But , Gus , is that actually so  --  that his friends are going to do something about it ? " " Your questions get harder and harder , " complained Petrie ' . " I was only speculating about a theoretical case . But surely you will agree that it might be a great pity to upset things now ? " " Naturally , " answered Margaret . Then suddenly she laughed . " Gus , I 've got to say it again . You 're positively clairvoyant  --  or whatever they call it . You 're perfectly wonderful ! " A shadow again falling over the lights from the windows made them both look round , but this time there was no explanation . Four heads could still be seen bent over the game . Margaret . however , seemed to take it as a signal . " Listen , Gus , " she commanded . " I could n't possibly go in there now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've begun a new rubber . I 'll make some excuse and slip along home . " As Perrier started to accompany her she held up her hand . " No , please . It will be bad enough going in there alone . " From his post in the shadows Perrier watched the girl cross the pia77a , then just before she reached the shaft of light turn gayly and toss him a kiss . The knob of the long window clicked behind her . A few minutes later Perrier himself strolled casually into the room . Bob MacGregor , who was shuffling the spare pack , hailed him boisterously . " Well , it 's just about time you showed up , " Bob exclaimed . " What in the world did you do to the young Queen of Sheba ? She came in here looking like a ghost and said she was n't feeling very well . " " I imagine she was n't , " agreed Perrier , but MacGregor continued to look at him , shaking his head . " Dangerous medicine , my boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you . The next thing you know she 'll have you running with that hot-cha crowd over in Southbridge  --  along with Bill Reilly and the Foote woman and all that sort of people . " Suddenly a strange look on som body 's face must have given him a hin He stopped dealing the cards an stared round . " What 's the matter ? " he demander " What have I said now ? " For a moment nobody answerer then Helen Perrier said rather icil " Perhaps you did n't know that Om ley Foote and Gus are first cord ins . " " I did n't , " confessed MacGregor . THIS IS MY COUNTRY BY ROBERT P. TRISTRAM COFFIN T HIS is my country , bitter as the sea , Pungent with the fir and bayberry . An island meadow , stonewalled , high , and lost , With August cranberries touched red by frost . Two hours of sun before the fog erases The walls on walls of trees trimmed sharp as laces . A house behind the last hill of them all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juniper upon a windy ledge , Splendor of granite on the world 's bright edge , A heron on the beach and one on wing , Wind wrapped round each last and living thing , A lighthouse like a diamond , cut and sharp , And all the trees like strings upon a harp . These are my people , saving of emotion , With their eyes dipped in the winter ocean , The lonely , patient ones , whose speech comes slow , Whose bodies always lean toward the blow , The enduring and the clean , the tough and clear , Who live where winter is the word for year And the briar rose had best be brief , Where most trees have a dagger for a leaf . These people are my kindred and my kind . They have a kind of lighthouse for a mind , Keeping lit inside because the sun Is too low to be a trusted one The cheerful , crystal people who have had The chance to know the tastejof being sad .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
