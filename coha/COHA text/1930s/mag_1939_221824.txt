When a Laguna Beach , Calif. garage owner named Harold Bradley was solemnly tapped on the back by his grey-haired fellow citizen Roy M. Ropp and told : " You are The Laughing Cavalier , " he neither called a cop , took to his heels , nor swung on the tapper . Like all good Lagunites , Bradley knew at once that this tapping singled him out for an honor-the honor of depicting one of the Living Masterpieces in Director Ropp 's famed " Pageant of the Masters . " <P> Of all the art colonies in California , Laguna is the artiest . Once a year , Laguna citizens put berets on their heads , hang palettes to the lamp posts along principal streets , welcome thousands of visitors to a ten-day cultural spree . <P> Laguna 's flag-bedecked festival site last week was a fenced-in , eucalyptus-shaded vacant lot two blocks from the sea . Under a big top near the puppet-show tent such bright California lights as Millard Sheets , William Wendt , William Griffith , Frank Cuprien , Ruth Peabody hung their pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booths forming an open square . In one booth free oils and modeling clay tempted visitors to test their talent . In another a fortune teller revealed if they had any to test . <P> The evolution of Laguna 's elaborate art-shindy from the first threadbare effort of 1932 , when depression-dumped artists hung their canvases on a fence facing Main Street and hoped for the best , has been gradual but steady . Five years ago , Real-estate Dealer Ropp , who is also a painter in his spare time , thought up a final terrific touch : a series of tableaux reproducing famous paintings and sculpture on a picture-frame stage . This year 44 paintings and ten pieces of sculpture are on the program . Its 54 letter-perfect , 90-second blackouts introduced by singers and dancers , separated by orchestral interludes and culminating in da Vinci 's Last Supper , have reached a professional pitch of perfection . <P> For months prior to the opening , more than 100 actors , including such local celebrities as Octogenarian Ella H. Goodrich , who does Whistler 's Mother , and ebony-skinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rehearse their tableaux as religiously as any Oberammergau Passion Player . This year , with the Assistance League of nearby Santa Ana offering $200 in art prizes , and the buildup of the local Chamber of Commerce corralling 1,500 spectators into every performance , The Festival of Arts at last got on a paying basis . Jubilant Director Ropp hoped to net $4,000 , looked forward to the day when his pageant would have its own permanent outdoor theatre .
