He knew the folly of it all . He chided himself , he scorned himself . He was being simply ridiculous . He would be , to any beholder , an object of laughter . Did he not know , had he not known all along , that his friendshipwith Zena had been what is called a " flirtation " ? What else , what more could it be ? She had been bored and he had come along , a pleasantrelief to her boredom , and she had been glad . He had filled a gap in her ennui . It had all been delightful .

He would rouse himself . He would go about as if nothing were the matter . he would look up Sandro , and Cornes , and laugh , and shrug his shoulders . Ile must be hard . " One must be hard , " said the German professor whom everyone was now reading . He carried out as best he could his resolve . He paraded an ostentatious , unnatural gaiety . He listened to Sandro 's stories and laughed . The Contessa Neroni , when she appeared at the afternoon reunions , took now a special interest in him , talked to him in her languid , drawling , affected manner , making discreet innuendoes . " I suppose you feel very bored , Mr. Bern , now that the princess is gone ? " the wretch would say , with a slow up and down movement of her blackened eyelashes . " Not bored , Contessa , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh , to be sure . There is plenty more fish in the sea , " the contessa assured him , with a lascivious smile . He exchanged banter , boldly , with Tea . In the morning , while bathing , he joined the liveliest crew of young people . He adopted Sandro 's trick of pinching girls ' legs while diving . Tea Neroni , vicious , did not scream , letting him stroke her limbs , under the water , as he pleased . Even the two daughters of Signora Bontempo , at the lace stall on the Nettuno , were in their manner condolatory and sympathetic . Angela smiled at him goodnaturedly . Sibilla , quiet and serious , glanced meaninglyunder her dark brows , as she talked . Comes looked very happy , but was not so often seen . Coming uponTHE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 141Julian one afternoon at the Nettuno , he asked him up to his room for a chat . Discreet , he asked no questions and made no allusions , but made little secret of his own affairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it does not do to be too sentimental . One must not ask too much . The little Primarosa , now , has about as much brains as a goose . But what legs ! A beatific vision springing from the mystic corolla of her multitudinous petticoats ! " He laughed . It seemed to Julian that Comes was arguing a little against himself and against what he surmised of Julian 's own mood . He was a good fellow at heart , Comes . " There 's a chap I know in Rome , one Artiglio Tura , " he said , " who spends a great deal of time travelling and exploring in Africa . The savages , he tells me , have no sentiment at all about women . It 's a disease that has come to us from the northern fogs , or somewhere . " " Is n't it that the savages are not able to appreciate brains , ' as you say , personality , and all that , whereas we do ? " Julian suggested . " Perhaps , " said Cornes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuade ourselves , in accordance with the precepts of the Christian religion , that we appreciate that only . We don '  --  ithout legs . " Julian pondered . Clearly it would be nonsense to pretend that his love for Zena was " pure . " It was not . It was nothing of the sort . Yet why , just that centering of his imagination , his desire upon one , which seemed to obliterate all others ? Both " mind " and body , sentiment and desire went together . They were , despite our distinctions , inextricably one . Julian confessed to Cornes that he had seen him , with the Marchesa , that evening at the Nettuno . " Oh , you did , did you ? " Carnes said with a laugh . " Do you know that , notwithstanding appearances which were , I admit , against me , I was not then playing the part of the villain , but , on the contrary , of the rescuing hero ?

" Cornes was leaving in a day or two , he told Julian . He was packing his books and his pictures and fencing tools . He gave Julian a card with his address in Rome . When Julian happened there , Comes would be glad if he would look him up. 142EUROPATHE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 143Julian found it hard at times to maintain his pose . He suffered horribly . Which , he wondered , was the pretence ? The hypocrisy , the sentimentalfeelings which made him suffer , or the effort to pretend that he did not suffer ? He was returning one evening from a stroll on the jetty . With a pang he had passed the fishing pavilion , now empty , dingy looking , where he had first seen Zena . As he was leaving the jetty , he was saluted by that absurd person , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arriving visitors . The man accosted him with an ingratiating grin from under his waxed moustache , and asked whether the Signorino would like " una belly ragazza . " Julian 's first impulse was to shake off curtly the tout . The man was persistent ; he followed him with his offers . The Signorino must not suppose that he , the poet , was offering to take him to a common brothel . He would not think of insulting with such an offer the Signorino . It was a question of a " ragazza di buona famiglia . " She would take no money . The Signorino would only pay fifty lire for the room . The Signorino could think it over . If it pleased the Signorino he would find the poet that evening in the Viale Umberto . The Signorino would do as he felt disposed . Julian felt a shudder of horror after the man had left him . How could he desecrate the image that was in his heart by consorting with a common prostitute ? No , no , a thousand times no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , at dinner , Julian was perturbed , torn by inward conflicts . " What is the matter with you ? " his mother asked him , solicitously . There was one of the little dances that evening at the Nettuno . " There are plenty of nice girls for you to dance with , " his mother said . " Tea Neroni , Maria Vertua , Carla . Have a good time and enjoy yourself . " " No . I am not dancing this evening , " he said . He went out after dinner towards the pinewood . What a fool he was ! He had it in his power , that moment , if he should keep his appointment with the rascal , to enjoy all the forbidden pleasures he had so long sought . Yet he was not happy . Who knows , the girl might be quite nice . What was the sense of being romantic , sentimental ? Zena ? He could never marry her . He could not be her lover . Probably he would never see her again . Fool , fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only heartache . Yet he allowed the thought of her to snatch away the cup of pleasure , such as it might be , when it offered . How absurd , how sentimental ! He passed the Villa Rosa . It was closed , dark . In the distance the lights of the Nettuno glittered . He could hear the wafted dance music . That evening with Zena , that evening . The convolvulus flowers , white , yellow , purple , in the darkness were closed , asleep for the night . The sphinx moths hovered , suspended over them . The dance music could be heard . It was the " Merry Widow " waltz they were playing . The street , bordered with oleanders , was deserted . What a noise he made as his feet crunched the gravel . In a house , somewhere , there was laughter . It was the Viale Umberto he was in . A man stepped out of the shadow of a hedge . " ? Buona sera , Signorine , " he said . Julian gave him a fifty-lire note . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villas , opened the gate . A servant girl answered the door . As she opened it , Julian caught a glimpse of the Signora Tarfutti , closing the door of the room she was in . The servant showed Julian to a room upstairs . It was a large bedroom , clean and tasteful . The window with white curtains was ajar . The distant music could still be heard . Julian waited . Presently he heard steps . The door opened . Closing it after her with the key , Sibilla Bontempo entered the room . The seaside season was fast drawing to a close . People were daily leaving . The beach , the Nettuno , assumed a deserted appearance . There had been storms . The blue sea had for days become green and crested with white breakers . The water had been chill . Julian 's parents had stayed among the last visitors , wishing , for his sake , " to make the most of the vacation . " Now , however , they were about to leave . They would stay a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while they went on to Rome . He looked forward with singularly little joy to Florence , almost with dread . He felt pacified now , in a numb , insentient manner . The dark Sibilla had been almost maternal in her solicitude . The gratification offered by her lavish impudicity had been fanned to a glow by her grave voluptuous subservience . He had felt soothed , content . As the train neared Florence , he thought of his desperate impulse to fly there , at once , cost what might . And now the big dome of Santa Maria dei Fiori was in sight . Zena was there , no doubt , somewhere on those green wooded hills . And he felt a chill , a pang , more over the flimsiness , the treachery , of his own dream than over Zena . They put up at an hotel near Santa Trinity . As soon as they had144 EUROPAarrived , Julian , going out on some pretext , hailed a cab . " To the Villa Lanternori , Bellosguardo , " he told the driver . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets , left the town by the Roman Gate , and climbed , at the slow pace of the bony horse , the meanderingdrive , through the parks and gardens of the hill . The driver did not know the villa , and had to stop to enquire . The first man he asked was unable to direct him . One of the gardeners , who was sweeping up the first deciduous leaves from the path , pointed the way through a side road . They reached the house , secluded in a large garden on the slope of the hill . The view of the town , with its dome , the towers of Giotto , of the Palazzo Vecchio and the Bargello , spread in the cup of the hills , was framed by the fronds of trees . Julian rang the bell at the iron gate , and a man came , after some moments , to open . Yes , their Excellencies had been at the villa , the man said in answer to Julian 's enquiry . But the Signore had left . They had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week ago , for Rome . The Signore had gone to Paris , or to Russia . He was not sure which . He called to a gardener who was digging a bed . " Gigi , is it to Russia the Signore went ? " " A Parigi , sono andate a Parigi , " the man called , looking up . " They only just left , only yesterday , " the porter repeated . Julian was not greatly surprised or disappointed , so clear had been hisforeboding that it would be thus . VSAW , during the following years , a good deal of Julian . AlthoughII was , when he entered at John 's , in the throes of an imminent " po1 , " he was to have upon my mental growth a greater influence than Cambridge had so far exercised . Lady Penmore had been , it must be admitted , very good to Julian , in her brusk , interfering manner . She bore most of his school and college expenses , and in the end had settled a small annuity upon him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to foster the interest she felt in her nephew 's welfare , much as she disapproved of many of his ways . It was his father who had spoiled him , she considered . She spoke with confidential candor to Julian about her pecuniary affairs . His uncle Horace , she said , was rich , certainly , but not fabulouslyrich . Those things always got grossly exaggerated . When a person was a great deal richer than themselves , people lost their sense of figures , as with astronomical distances . Lady Penmore had considerablyenlarged her husband 's competence by her own judicious investments . Gilt-edged securities were a piece of snobbery . They paid scarcely anything at all . There was much too much money in England ; the government and the railways were too rich . Baron Rubinstein , the international banker , had given Lady Penmore invaluable advice . She had done very well with her Russian bonds . Russia was such a rich country , though the wealth was , much of it , still untapped . The bonds were as good as consols and not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in German industrial shares . German industry was growing by leaps and bounds , at an incredible pace . Some people might , of course , say that it was unpatriotic to lend money to our rivals . But businesshad nothing to do with patriotism . It was silly to mix the two things together . The armaments firms , Krupp , Dillinger-Hiitte , had no scruple in selling guns to England . There were Frenchmen , soundheadedAme : icans among the chief shareholders . Baron Rubinstein had put Lady Penmore in the way of acquiring for a mere song propertyin Germany , in Belgium , the value of which was increasing every day . Then there were the London properties . Mr. Notice , her agent , had been exceedingly practical . There were houses in Bloomsbury , in Coram145146 EUROPA THE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 147Street , and in Maida Vale , which had turned out most satisfactorily . Yes , she had been pretty shrewd , she told Julian with satisfaction , and considered that she had acquired a good right to her personal settlements . She would settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in something over four hundred pounds a year . Not very much , to be sure , but sufficient , if he kept his clothes well brushed , to insure the retention of his self-respect . When he first came up to Cambridge , we saw little of Julian . He plunged with frenzied intensity into philosophical studies . For weeks he would be wholly inaccessible , shutting himself up from all human contact in his lodgings . He made a dishevelled appearance in pyjamas and an overcoat at early chapel and signed on , and would not be seen again till Hall , when he scarcely spoke . One might catch a glimpse of him on a bicycle on the windy road leading to Cavendish Hall , or skulking about the Backs and playing hide and seek behind the trees in Erasmus walk . But for the rest he might as well have been severely " gated . " I more than once remonstrated with him , when occasion offered , and with increasing insistence upon his unsociable behavior . He was going deliberately against the whole spirit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I hinted , not making himself popular . Only once was I able to persuade him to go to the Union . I expressed concern about his overworking . Julian was unimpressed by my expostulations . " I shall make up for it all right very soon , " he said , with a smile . " Look here , old man , I did not come here to let the place make me , but to make use of it . Just at present I have to spend my forty days in the wilderness . Afterwards I shall be free to listen with safety to what anyone has to say . " Julian worked a good deal at biology . He struck up a friendship with Sir Anthony Fisher , the Cornelius Crustice lecturer on Animal Morphology and Jones Reader in Marine Zoology , which was to last till Sir Anthony 's death . Fisher held views that were sharply at variance with those professed by the reigning Post-Darwinian sects . The dogmatism of the latter had already embittered , more than theological opposition , the last years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which represented the reproductive cells as mystic structures of incredible complexity , containing in an invisible architecture all the future embryos of the race in pre-formedelements . Sir Anthony regarded the official view as a farrago of convictedinconsistencies belied by experimental knowledge as well as by plain logic . All the facts of heredity , no less than those of growth and of physiological function , were explicable simply and clearly as reactions of bio-chemistry . The power of reproduction by such reactions to the physiological environment constantly repeated in the race was common to all the cells of the body , and was only abolished in most of them by specialized adaptation to other functions . The reproductive cells , which remained undifferentiated , owed their power , he considered , to the fact of their being the simplest instead of being , as the sects taught , the most complex in the organism . So overwhelming , however , was the prestige of the academic cliques , that Sir Anthony had given up as futile any attempt to dispute the dogmatismof the Mendelian gospel as interpreted by Professor Bateson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence , saying that one might as well bring forward arguments and evidence to combat the Catholic Church . Despite the academic appointments which he owed to the influence of some friends on the Stock Exchange , he was regarded as an outsider and treated accordingly with a polite , contemptuoustolerance by the ruling clique . Sir Anthony had made his name chiefly over the technical assistance which he had been able to give in connection with the laying of one of the transatlantic cables , and had been knighted on that account by Queen Victoria , whose personalregard he had enjoyed . He directed a small marine station near Liverpool . He was a kindly , modest and retiring man with a glossy white head , of hair and pointed beard . Sir Anthony Fisher was delighted to find in Julian an intelligent appreciation of his views , which coincided with the impression which Julian had already derived from the scientific controversy . He stayed , when in Cambridge , with his friend Professor Skiddle , the worldfamousauthority on the Shi'ite Arabian mystics of the twelfth century , and Julian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Madingley Read to lunch or to spend the evening . He would sometimes meet there the Indian philosopher , Sir ScaliawallahBlahgore , who was acting as tutor to the twenty-fifth son of the Maharajah of Ballahore , then studying at Trinity . The Eastern sage used to explain to Sir Anthony that the biological doctrines which were beginning to dawn upon the apprehension of the Western World had long been envisioned in their essence by the intuitive faculty of the Mahatmas of old . The process had been clearly described by them as148 EUROPAthe permeating diffusion of metarupa Karma in the linga sharira , or astral plane of subetheric consubstantiality , materializing ectogeneticallyinto the jiva ripa , through the differential emanation of the third quintessence of entity . The so-called theory of natural selection , re-discoveredby Darwin , had been set forth with great precision in the poetical commentary by Sankyanmudah on the **27;3099;TOOLONG , where the pre-elective metemspsychosis of final substance was shown to order the evolutive procession of absolute form through every plane of realization in the seven phases of being . The learning and views of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the university . Sir Anthony Fisher found little to answer to the arguments of the Indian sage , and took his word for it that oriental science was entirely in agreement with his own views , while it at the same time harmonised them by a higher synthetic process of unification with the spiritual truths prefigured in the Book of Genesis . On several occasions , Sir Anthony asked Julian down to his home in Lancashire , where Lady Fisher , a simple and kindly pious woman , made him welcome . It was a modest household . The Fishers had one young daughter , Paula , on whom they lavished a tender affection . Julian helped Sir Anthony with his experiments , and particularly with the literary preparation of his accounts of them . His views had so far only been published in any detail in an elaborate monograph , which appeared in one of the microscopical journals , " On the early stages of segmentationof Sueniokolpos Eselniannii , and some other acephalous worms . " The work , which will probably be recognised in a century or two as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little attention . Sir Anthony confided to Julian his disappoinment and discouragementand the plan which he nursed of a monumental exposition of his views , for which he was accumulating material and dissertations , but which he did not hope , or care , to have published until after his death . He showed Julian the pile of chaotic manuscripts , doubting , he said , whether he would ever be able to organise them . Julian was fascinated by the array of conclusive evidences and the penetrating thought , which cast upon the whole subject of the mechanisms of life a new light , contrastingwith the obscure and confused inconsistencies of official academic science . But Sir Anthony had no gift of literary exposition , and his crabbed and technical style , and total lack of orderly arrangementin his meticulous discussions of details , the significance of which was clear enough to his own penetrating mind , rendered the work almostTHE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 149unintelligible to anyone who entertained opposite preconceptions . The idea took shape very early in their acquaintance that Julian should some day help to edit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacunae in the extensive chain of research . Julian was , for the present , chiefly occupied with philosophy . He attended the lectures of Professor Thurniwall Umpton on post-Hegelian currents in realistic idealism . But the lectures only served as a comic relief , and as a fearful example , warning him against any weakening of his resolve to think clearly . With severe discipline he waded line by line through the mazes of the metaphysical wilderness with the same conscientiousnesswith which he had formerly perused Doctor Frost 's treatise , resolved to probe the foundations upon which the scaffolding of thought was built , the scaffolding which enclosed the protoplasmic jelly of life , grown human and articulate . In order to perfect his German he sought out the assistance of a somewhat seedy son of the Vaterland , who was employed as a proofreaderby the Fetter Lane Press . Herr Pfeffer was a social-democrat . He had been obliged to take refuge in England owing to his having evaded military service , and had been imprisoned for lese-majeste for having published disparaging remarks about the German Emperor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the intricacies of German syntax . Pfeffer held the strange theory that there existed a definite relation between any philosophical opinion which a person might hold and the condition of that person 's banking account . He indeed went so far as to affirm that the said relationwas the one fundamental law of all philosophical thought . Julian sometimes discussed with Pfeffer the virulence of scientific dogmatism in regard to biological conceptions of heredity . The German would laugh in his coarse , cynical manner , and deliver himself on the subject in his peculiar English . " All that is already to be expected , " he said . " You will find , my young friend , when you to philosophical observation more accustomed are , that the academic peoples , the Fachleute , are mit one ur- and haupt- : dea concerned , namely , the self-standing in-itselfness of the Individual . To defend that high-sacred dogma , it is needful that ideas , opinions , sentiments , and Geistesbewegungen , and all the bloody nonsensemit which the peoples have their heads , like Frankfurter sausages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Your Mr. John Locke , who not the technique of our German philosophers , but much common sense had , was by all persons of good culture , 150 EUROPAincluding our Herr Geheimrath von Leibnitz , execrated and damned with much wrath for pointing out that an idea can not inborn be , any more than the Catechism of the gramma  --  s once supposed . Our Herr Kant , who was , as you say , a canned Scotchman , gave himself much trouble urn a red herring to draw across the road . So , my young friend , can it be bewondered that your biologists mit good academic positions tumble the one over the other to prove the immutable , predeterminedheredity ? Natiarlich ! Your landlords , they believe in the heredity of real property ; your noble lords , they believe in the heredity of blue blood ; the powers by the grace of God established , which call themselves nations , such as your thief England , they believe in the heredity of superior races . We also , of course , believe in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the peoples mit good banking accounts and expectations by heredity transmissible , believe in the excellence of heredity and in the hereditary stupidity of the lower classes . The individual mit an immutable immortal soul by heredity transmitted , that is the corner stone , the Grundanschauung of all the thoughts of an immutably rascally thief society . Were that not so , would it not evidently appear that the high-respectable opinions of the immortal thieves one pack of bloody lies are ? " After chuckling and choking over the malodorous clouds from his pipe , Herr Pfeffer continued : " Sir Fish might as good argue against the Pope of Rome . Wellsmiled-uponacademic Fachleute will continue to teach that what they teach not taught is , but inherited by immortal souls mit immutable human natures . You can not argue against the preestablished order of a universe mit hereditary property except by blowing it up to the devi  --  here it belongs . " Julian was amused by the eccentric views of the German , but found his language somewhat obscure . He reserved judgment . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " will much better understand psychology when you no more money have . It is as difficult for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven as for one cameleopard through the eye of one needle to pass . " I came upon Julian one morning in the plum-colored precincts of the second court of John 's , whistling an air from Rigoletto , ' and looking mighty spruce and pleased with himself . I happened to be rather harassed myself and dejected , as were most Johnians that day , having just been through a severe milling in our " Mays . " THE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 151 " I have finished , " he announced to me brightly . " So I infer , and from the looks of you that you have done brilliantly . For my part I made a ghastly hash of that unseen Thucydides , " I dolefully said . " Oh , I 'm not talking about that , " Julian said . " I mean philosophy . " I looked him over queerly for associated symptoms of delusions of grandeur . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to lunch with him at the Blue Boar . While discussing the steaks and chips and tankards of bitter , I suggested he should redeem his promise to make up for his unsocial conduct . Julian declared himself ready for any dissipation . Everard Pallier had more than once expressed a wish to meet him at his rooms . Julian agreed to go that evening when , as I knew , Pallier would be keeping open house . After commons we dropped in , Julian and I , at Pallier 's rooms . The company was dimly visible through clouds of smoke , dimly intelligible through clouds of words . Waters , our host 's " gyp , " with perspiring brow , was circulating the refreshments . Pallier was the eldest son of Lord Bar , and although disgustingly well off , had a sympathetic intelligence . He greeted Julian with high courtesy coupled , as was his affectation , with a rude bantering . " I 've long wanted to meet a more conceited fellow than myself , MeyaXoajTas ei , 7repi4pova 8 ' Acmes , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best available leather chair , and divertingWaters 's supplies in his direction . " What 's this Foster has been telling me ? That you have , you asseverated , finished philosophy ? This is n't exactly a finishing school for young ladies , you know , though some of our fair Newnhamites and Girtonians would get all the finishing they want were they to venture within the precincts of our masculine frustration . You have been doubtless misreported . We shall give you the benefit of the doubt , seeing you do n't look an ass . " " Thank you , " Julian said . " Though I do n't claim to be entitled to much benefit on the charge laid . " " Come , come . Have some Black and White , " said Pallier , filling Julian 's glass . " You shall explain yourself . Say when . I flatter myself I know somewhat about philosophy . It 's my Special , ' since they have n't pornography on the Tripos . I find it almost equally amusing as a documentary record of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient recreation . " Julian would not be readily drawn. 152 EUROPATwo youths were engaged so hotly in discussion that they had scarcely noticed our entrance . " Bergson , with his as though ' and an it were , ' is after all like the rest a pragmatist , " Quentin Prince was saying . " I tell you they are one and all merely trying to save the face of metaphysics while they 're throwing up the sponge . " " Pascal might be accounted a pragmatist , " Pallier interposed . " He settled his first principles by the laying of a bet , backing the abdication of reason . " " It 's scientific materialism that has thrown up the sponge , " said Illings , a young man with active eyebrows and alarmed combative eyes , shielded behind heavy lenses . " Those fellows at the Cavendish have knocked the bottom out of materialism . " " I never thought of test tubes as spiritual revelations exactly , " Prince sneered . " Here , you fellows , is a man who will settle the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julian to the lions . " Are you a Stinks ' man ? " Illings enquired , turning his lenses upon Julian . " In a mildly malodorous way , " Julian modestly admitted . " Have dabbled a trifle in biology . Animals have become somewhat important since it has come to be known that philosophers are not disembodied intelligences or immortal souls , but animals . " " Donkeys ! " Pallier glossed with gusto . " Do n't listen to him , do n't listen , " said Illings , veiling his pain under a wry smile . " Pallier is a heathen cynic . Has no first principles . " " Absurd ! " Prince protested . " Lives there a human that is without first principles ? Waters , there , hath them ; Mrs. Pilch , my bedder , has no others ; Christabel , the barmaid at the Bird in Hand , ' has first principles . Damned definite , categorical , and obdurate first principles . And , of course , outrageously erroneous .

A man might remain content with shrugging his shoulders over the dark deeds of the handmaiden of theology , were it not that she has preempted the very ground on which he treads . Either he must build up anew from the deepest foundations or go through life with every one of his limping thoughts set askew on crooked premises . " Julian encompassed the speaker with his approving gratitude . Oh , the wicked , wasted toil of unlearning ! Learning were nothing to it . " People get along quite well with conventions , " Pallier said sedately , THE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 153his head thrown back , addressing the perfect vortex ring Gnat trembled up from his lips towards the ceiling . Shifting uneasily in the best leather armchair , Julian was fretted with the temptation to register his great dissent . IIdXac To acyuv OdpaaxcovfXd/3 ) s gr . ) .

Picture , I ask you , the state of things were England not sailing upon smooth waters , were English conventions about first principlesto break down so that none could keep afloat on them . " " Hey ! Hey ! Help ! ' Pallier called aloud in mock alarm , shouting across the room to where , by the diamond panes , Doctor Dimley , his tutor , sat wearing upon his countenance a smile indelible , engaged in interlacing his fingers and in discussing with Joe Cunningham John 's chances of heading the river at the Lenten bumps . " Here 's a man , sir , who 's making our flesh creep . Inviting us to contemplate England , the last refuge of Hellenism , in obscene disarray , bereft of her conventions .

In the cage of collective conventions , Julian thought . The myth of epistemological impotence irked him . " You do n't mind if I 'm serious , " he asked , " for a moment ?

But quite another task has been set by her taskmistress , the task of proving the conclusions which are foregone in her questionable premise  --  eality , mind , matter , body , soul . " " Gott , Freiheit , and Unsterblichkeit , " put in Prince . " Kant says it quite plainly . The business of metaphysics is to prove the catechism . " " Feuerbach got kicked out because he was too loosely Spinozistic , " observed Pallier .

Some of the mystics are also very attractive . You will rememberHegel 's mystic synthesis of the Vernunft between the dogmatic thesis of the Verstand and the sceptical antithesis , a notion which he , by the way , appears , I believe , to have borrowed from Fichte . But one must keep an open mind . Too earnest a conviction is , if I may so express myself , largely a departure from the perfect philosophicalspirit . Though , of course , convictions are entitled to every respect .

" Palliersaid . " Do you remember when we sat up all night to find out whether that chair really existed ?

On our departing , Pallier drew Julian aside . " You have paid your footing , and well , " he said . " We shall know158 EUROPA more of each other . You have not been taking enough exercise . I must take you to Mildenhall with me . Yes ? Till soon , then . " Pallier owned a two-seater runabout , which greatly extended the range of his sporting activities , and the somewhat vulgarised Gog Magog was exchanged for less crowded haunts . We would sometimes join him in a round at Mildenhall . But Julian could never be roused to effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut more turf than brilliant figures at the links , laughing over his irremediable clum- siness . He was led to frequent with Pallier the pleasant bungalow of the Koe-Billingses , in Grange Road , which served as a meeting place for feminine coteries from Newnham and Girton . Mrs. Koe-Billings , young and picturesque in an auburn Burne-Jonesish way , was an old Newn- hamite . FIer husband was a musician , a devotee of Bach , the term " music " having , indeed , scarcely any application for him outside the works of that composer . He played the organ at St. Benet 's and di- rected the Bach Society which inflicted vocal quartets upon evening gatherings wherever it could penetrate . Mrs. Koe-Billings herself cul- tivated the reputation of being an artis  --  here were some canvases by her about the hous  --  he full expansion of whose talents had suf- fered premature arrest in consequence of Koe-Billings 's lessons in har- mony while she was a student at Newnham . There was a suggestion of tragedy in her hesitation between art and motherhood , and growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her destiny toward the latter . Like some of her young friends , she conveyed an exaggerated impression of her intelligence by an appearance of absent- mindedness when conversing , as though she had some difficulty in calling off her mind from its abstraction in more serious matters to the triviality of the immediate occasion to which it was her painful duty to devote a portion of her attention . A flock of earnest young women fluttered down from Newnham and Girton upon Mildred Koe-Billings 's pastel-colored home . Prince had a sister at Girton , who had been the incidental means of Pallier 's ac- quaintance with the Koe-Billingses . The interests of Marion Prince and her friends centered upon the cause of women 's suffrage , and their group constituted , in fact , the local branch of the Women 's Social and Political Union . Miss Emily Davies , the venerable founder of Girton , and now chairman of the London Society for Woman Suffrage , fanned and directed the activities of the young women , and Lady Strachey , at THE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 159the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the population of Cambridge , led in like manner the forces of Newnham . Mildred Koe-Billings herself was hand and glove with the Pankhursts , and acted as their chief intermediary with the Cambridgeset . In frequent encounters with the militant virgins , Pallier got considerablefun out of pulling their legs . For , although in reality fully sympathizing with their aims , he would delight , in his arguments with them , to act the part of advocatus diaboli , and to exasperate the young amazons by the deliberate persistence of his adverse logic . He would seduce them into what he termed " orgies , " at the Cambridge Arms , invitingthem to lavish banquets and carousals in despite of the severity of college regulations . When Marion and her friends showed signs of reserve and adduced the rules and the proprieties , Pallier would pour forth his scorn upon them for the enslavement of their sex to the conventions , and tell them that they were no better than a pack of Victorianold maids , till the baited young women were compelled to demonstratetheir independence by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything orgiastic in the extremely pleasant and sedate suppers in which we occasionally indulged in the private diningroomof the hostelry . Julian with Quentin Prince and Gressom , a Scottish medico whose acquaintance Julian had made at the anatomical museum , plied with their banter the " foolish virgins , " as Pallier was wont to refer to them , while enjoying their company . Marion Prince and her friends , Margaret Melway , a large Venetian red girl of promising achievements in Greek archaeology , and Katherine Croy , dark and thin , with - dilated , nervous eyes , maintained a defiant and somewhat alarmed defensive as the victims of Pallier 's sadistic attacks . " All we ask is to be treated as human beings , " Katherine Croy declared . " But , my dear young lady , that is precisely the whole insoluble socialproblem , " Pallier would say . " Do you treat your maid-of-all-work as a human being , Miss Croy ? If we treated our slave  --  am dispensingwith euphemisms in referring to the servile classe  --  s human beings , they would no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we males treated women as human beings , women would become divested of any functional value to us as sexual preys , sex being , as you may have heard , a combat in which the male in order to discharge the function assigned to him by nature , plays the part of conqueror . Do not ask us to treat you as equals . The Christian religion has already16o EUROPA THE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 161attempted to abolish the laws of nature , but has had to avow itself beaten after two thousand years . " " That is sheer sophistry , " Margaret Melway protested with flushed indignation . " You are merely trying to draw a red herring across the trail . " " Oh , nothing so horrible and vulgar as a red herring , " Pallier smiled . " What is that delicate perfume you use , Miss Melway ? I venturethe guess that it is Quelques Fleurs . ' When you draw such a delightful scent across the equality of the sexes , you have scarcely the right to charge me with such malodorous stinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakened by champagne , the defeated amazons were driven back in cabs to the fastnesses of Girton at an hour which necessitated concerted prevarications on their part to appease the wrath of the presiding Minervas . Julian fled for refuge from Pallier 's incitations to frivolity in the willowy reaches of the Upper River . He would take a canoe at Garrett Hostel Bridge and paddle up to Grantchester Mill pool . Sometimes he asked me to join him , and during the long idle hours would speak , as I questioned him , retrospectively of what he called his breaking through the tangled cocoon woven about him by the ages . He would have some book with him , picked up at random , and on first looking at it under the shade of the willows , would sometimes break out into laughter . " Look , what I have brough  --  hat old bore Virgil ! Was there ever such an unimaginative , poisonous old stick of a pompous pedant ? Talks like a liberal vicar .

' " Our segregation was seldom , however , secure from intrusion . The flannelled crew of some craft would break in upon our colloquies with challenging shouts and banter . Pallier would sometimes join us , with Prince , or Gressom , vivaciously obtrusive . " Is our philosopher still expounding the universe to you , Foster ? " Pallier would quiz . " The universe is only important to ghosts , " Julian retorted . " Lifeis important . The confounded nuisance is that one has to clear the decks of the great illusion that the universe is important before one can live . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motioned . " The point about life is this . . . " Pallier began . " Wait , there 's a confounded wasp buzzing close to my nose . Wait till I 've got it , " Gressom , the medico would exclaim . " I want to hear Pallier 's point about life . Got it . Do n't squirm like that , you little brute , ca n't you die quickly ? Now , the point about life , you were saying ? " " You 've upset the flow of my philosophic thought with your brutal slaughter . You 'll have to wait now till I recapture the divine afflatus . Ca n't you be serious ? Damn you , I was going to say the most profoundthing that human lips have ever uttered . And you with your damned wasp . . . . " Stretched at full length , his hands behind his head , Julian watched the dance of the libelulae . How rich was the grace of the dragon flies under the sun 's stillness , skimming the punctured water ! " Life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two parts , " Pallier laid down . " Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres , " Prince recalled . " If you persist in being flippant , I 'll duck you in the water , " said Pallier . " Sorry , old man . Fire ahead . Life consists of two parts . " " The main and principal part is to enjoy it , " Pallier emitted . " I reserve my judgment till you have told us what is the second partof life for which the first was made , " said Prince . " That 's a Victorian , hypocritical , insincere , stupid niaiserie . The second part of life consists in obtaining the means to enjoy it . That is the tragedy , the tragedy of human stupidity . All busy obtaining the means , money , intelligence , savoir-faire . It was an old Johnian , SamuelButler , who said : All animals except man know that the object of life is to enjoy it . ' " " Which wisdom being translated , signifies : having befuddled ourselveswith metaphysics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Gressom said . May week was upon us . The more serious of us usually eschewed the feminine invasion which poured a flood of tulle and scent upon our drab staircases , the seasoned reek of our rooms . Our gyps had , with162 EUROPAprofessional expertness , imparted to our dens an unnatural air of studiousgravity and decorous tidiness , rearranging our books and pictures , giving prominence to our Liddell and Scotts , and eliminating or concealing , with sure literary and artistic judgment , the lighter aspects of our libraries and artistic decorations . Many of us fled from the cataclysm as from a spring cleaning . The tidal wave of maternal and spinsterly relatives , prying aunts and cousins , discharged the brunt of its violence upon the more muscularportions of the academic foundations . The dread that any indicationof their being emotionally affected by the irruption of feminine charms should be detected by their fellows was so prepotent in those young Greek gods with hypertrophied muscular and atrophied cerebral tissues that the affectation hardened into an authentic physiological fact , and they bore themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perverts . The fluttering of the younger portionsof the invading army was inhibited by the very excess of their excitement and by the awe of the scholastic atmosphere . The level of festiveness was brought down to that of a Band of Hope beano or a school prize-giving . The gatherings at Mildred Koe-Billings were during May week augmented by the presence of several members and friends from London . The feministic ferment was rising to high ebullition , and action was being called for . The second reading of the Women 's Franchise and Disabilities Bill , moved in the Commons by Sir Charles Dilke , had been talked out . A deputation was being organised to wait upon the Prime Minister , Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman . The militant virgins were at present agitated over the choice of representatives . Lady Strachey was holding meetings for the purpose . Pallier , intent upon demoralising the political activities of the young women , got up a coach to Newmarket for the Two Thousand Guineas on the very day on which the final committee meeting had been called . " The rape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With Prince and Julian he set off in a dashing four-in-hand to Newmarket Heath , carrying away Marion Prince , Margaret Melway , Katherine Croy , and other pillars of the cause . Among the visitors whom Julian had met at the Koe-Billings was Eleanor Astley , a cousin of Pallier 's . She seemed to take little part in the political activities of the group , but rather sought her friends , Mildred and her husband , on the ground of her own interest in music . THE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 163Mildred was , however , detached from such frivolities , and Koe-Billings had no views on Debussy and Tchaikowski ; holding that all harmonic combinations were to be found in their most perfect form in the works of Sebastian Bach , the productions of other composers being but imperfect variations upon his themes . Julian had more than incidentallynoted Miss Astley 's full-bloomed beauty , a little old-fashioned and " good , " which contrasted with the desinvolture and earnestness of the " young women of the period . " Giles Strachey , who was then at Trinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and said she was a plagiarism from Du Maurier . In the hubbub of Mrs. Koe-Billing'scrowded little drawingroom , Julian , after a perfunctory introduction , had had little opportunity of making her acquaintance . To his delight , when they drove to Newmarket , the vacant seat on the secondbox which fell to his lot was next to Miss Astley 's . Her eyes smiled greetings as she made room . In great style , with brass blowing and burnished harness rattling , the high-stepping greys rode out over the flat country into the sparkle of the clear spring morning . " Is n't this better than a stuffy pow-wow ? " Julian remarked to his neighbor . " Indeed it is , especially a hens ' pow-wow , " Miss Astley said . " You are not loyal . Are n't you interested in woman suffrage ? " " Oh , I am , but . . . " Miss Astley hesitated . " But you are not sufficiently enthusiastic to eschew the vanities for the sake of the ideal , " Julian suggested . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to entice poor Lady Strachey 's best recruits , " said Miss Astley . " Still , it is an argument against the suffrage . " " A fundamental argument , you think ? " queried Julian . " No , no . You misunderstand me . I am interested . I think it 's tremendouslyimportant . More , perhaps , than our friends realise . What I mean is that it is not the chief thing . Imagine , for instance , if the women of Spain were to vote . They would have the inquisition and the autos-da-fe back . And then it is all part of other things that are so much more fundamental . " They were passing through Barnwell , and the hedged fields had for the moment given place to dismal rows of decayed brick . " This is what I mean , " Miss Astley said with a wave of a small , gloved hand. deleted linesLady Cecily Castle , hoped Julian would call at Chesterfield Gardens when he was in town . Under the russet moon which bathed between the steep walls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pipes of Pan played . VIT HE exodus which flowed townwards in the wake of the retreatingtide of visitors , after May week , did not hide the last demoraliseddays of term . The Koe-Billingses moved to their flat in Bayswater . The amazons made up , by their ardor to take part iii the activity which was intensely developing in political circles , for the derelictions into which Pallier and his friends had beguiled them . Lady Penmore was anxious that Julian should be in London while Welby was on leave from Vienna . With an inconsistency for which I was not prepared , Julian , as if in rebound from his prolonged mood of anchoretic retirement and concentration , seemed to swing to the opposite pole of exuberance , and plunged light-heartedly into the vortexof the London carnival . I who had , I know not why , assumed the part of a mentor , and reproved him for the excessive severity of his industry and ascetic isolation , now found myself embarrassed by what seemed the frivolity of his preoccupations . He consulted us about the color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tailor , and Julian spent an inordinate amount of money upon the perfection of his grooming . Lady Penmore 's semi-political gatherings in Half-Moon Street , which had served to pull wires on behalf of Welby 's advancement , had hitherto given her the comfortable feeling that she was shouldering her part of responsibility as a member of the English ruling-class . She was now at a loss in the devastation wrought by the liberal landslideof the election . The cataclysmic collapse of immemorial Tory rule was in her sight a cosmic convulsion beside which the unusually lively eruption of Vesuvius and the San Francisco earthquake were minor disturbances in the order of the universe . Welby Penmore , whom Julian had not seen for some years , was decidedly improved by his diplomatic experience . An undisputable outer garb of good form clothed his awkwardness in the same manner as irreproachable tailoring garbed his angular person . His reddish hair was sleekly plastered down , but for one rebellious parrot 's feather at the back of his head . But the adenoid smile that played on his mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a permanent sneer . In order not to crowd the house , and also to enjoy more freedom , Julian put up at a little hotel in Arundel Street . " The country is going to the dogs , " Lady Penmore said , reiterating the refrain of her afternoon 's conversations , as she drove to Park accompanied by Baroness Rubinstein , Welby , and Julian . Baroness Rubinstein , the wife of the international banker , was the daughter of Sir Baruch Benjudah , the dynamite magnate , originally a tobacconist in Saloniki . The exotic fascination of her hard , but picturesque Assyrianprofile , her creamy complexion , raven-black hair , full crimson lips , and the regal poise of a luxuriant oriental figure , caused Esther Rubinstein to be accounted by many one of the handsomest Jewesses in Europe . Lady Penmore did not as a rule like the company of women , especially those having , like the baroness , claims to good looks . She herself suffered from an unfortunate predisposition to eczema , and her somewhat blotchy complexion , which an inordinate use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular disadvantage in the immediate proximity of women epidermally more fortunate . But the times required that she should cultivate the favor of high finance , whose influence was more and more tending to displace that of the politicians . " The country is going to the dogs , " she repeated , blinking slowly and casting a comprehensive glance round the surrounding scene , as if in confirmation of her assertion . The carriage had been brought to a standstill by a block in the traffic near Devonshire House . Four deep , hung on their high Csprings , the carriages stood , bearing , like baskets of flowers , their freight of opulent elegance . It was the height of the season , and one of those balmy , still , spring afternoons of which London possessesthe monopoly , and which seem a part of her stately imperial magnificence . In the golden light and the clear purple shadows , the women 's dresses spread their arrogant luxury on the rep cushions as in a great exclusive open-air drawingroom , where only the ruling class of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the champing of the high-bred horses at their bits . A detachment of Life Guards , which had been escorting the King of Spain to Kensington Palace , was crossing Hyde Park Corner to the Mall , holding up the stream of carriages . Over the cockaded hats of the coachmen and grooms , the scarlet tunics and the helmets and breastplates flashed in a light haze of golden dust . THE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 169Lady Penmore 's carriage drove on through the Park gates , on which was affixed a large notice to the effect that " Mechanically propelled vehiclesand unleashed dogs are not admitted . " The slow stream thronged the Ladies ' Mile . Princess Ena of Battenberg , driving with Princess Henry and the Duchess of Argyle , acknowledged the salutes . Among the women , much conversation turned on the royal bride 's trousseau which was on view at the palace , the wonderful underlinen fashioned by French nuns , the afternoon dresses supplied by Madame Agnes Bell , and the marvellous bridal gow  --  oon , alas , to be spatteredwith blood in the Calle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Baroness Rubinstein remarked to Lady Penmore , " that the trousseau of Miss Alice Roosevelt , who is marryingMr .

" There 's Mr. Astor with Mrs. George Cornwallis West and Mr. Whitelaw Reid . He has just given Clivedon Manor as a wedding gift to his son who is marrying the divorced wife of Mr. Shaw . " The stream of carriages came again to a standstill as they approached Albert Gate , where guests were leaving a reception at the French embassy . Some were drawn up to the side , while the main current flowed on . Against the blaze of the rhododendron bushes , the morning coats and silk hats of the men thronged the gravel walk . The Earl of Powis and Lord Balcarres stood by the carriage of Georgiana , Countess of Guilford . A few yards ahead , Everard Pallier , a gardenia in his buttonhole , was leaning over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her niece and Lady Dickson-Poynder . As he caught sight of Julian and raised his hat , he signed to him to join them for a moment . " Eleanor wants to make an assignation with you , " he said to Julian , who had stepped down , and now came to greet the ladies . " I take no notice of Everard 's improper suggestions , " Miss Astley said . " I want you to do me a favor , Mr. Bern . Will you take me to Covent Garden for the Ring ? " " You can always have my box , dear , " said Lady Castle . " You know I never go to the German operas . " " Your box is too conspicuous , Aunt Cecily , " Miss Astley said .

One does n't like to be exclusively opposition . It is not good form . Yet what is one to do ? One can not ask people like Mr. Lloyd George or Mr. Burns , can one ? Or dreadful persons like Mr. Keir Hardie or Mr. Ramsay Macdonald , that one simply could n't know . " " Your footman would give notice if he had to handle Mr. Keir Hardie 's tweed cap , Lady Penmore , " Pallier said . " And I should n't blame him .

" " Some American had the court of the Savoy flooded the other day , and dinner served on a huge gondola , " said the baroness . " There were twenty-four guests , and it cost over three thousand pounds , I hear . " " How vulgar ! " exclaimed Lady Penmore . " That 's the sort of thingTHE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 171which is breaking up the home . You 'll come on Tuesday ? " she added , as the stream of carriages began once more to flow on .

A small elegant open victoria was approaching , in which a beautiful young woman holding a purple and white sunshade sat alone . He caught her eye as he raised his hat .

" I have every moment booked right up to Ascot week . " " What about Lady Cressiden 's ? " Pallier said . " Hush , be careful , " the young woman said , with a quick glance up towards the box . " Will you be at Saxford House ? " " Yes , " Pallier said . " I 'll see you there , then . Maybe I can think of something . " She smiled beautifully at him as she held out her white-gloved hand .

During the interval of the Walkiire , the Savoy was crowded , althoughmany people relinquished on Wagnerian nights their opera boxes to persons interested in music . In the lounge Princess Patricia of Connaught , who was talking to Mrs. Montefiore and another lady , called Eleanor Astley . She wished to introduce to her a Mrs. Snowden , the wife of the socialist member for Blackburn . " Mrs. Snowden is an ardent suffragist , Eleanor , " Princess Pat said , " and , like ourselves , an enthusiastic Wagnerite . " Mrs. Montefiore , the princess told Eleanor , had for two years refused to pay her taxes , declaring that she would not do so until she had a vote , and defying the Chancellor of the Exchequer . " How splendid ! " Mrs. Snowden exclaimed . " Eleanor is quite one of the most intelligent girls in England , " the princess said to Julian as he was presented . He managed to ward off the attempts at recognition of an old Wintonian , Bertie Turldey , the son of the Bishop of Shoreditch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the Gaiety .

" Is it love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You did n't blame life for the horror and the misery you were pointing out the other day on the way to Newmarket , did you ? " Eleanor did not reply . She drew her cloak over her bare shoulders . People were rising . Dorothy Coston glanced over at Julian and Eleanor . They walked back . The crowd in evening clothes streamed across the Strand while the policeman held up the traffic , and up Bow Street , past the theatrical costume shops , and the Covent Garden porters that stared good-naturedly . The red-coated sentry at the entrance stood at the salute . Darkness fell over the diamond-studded tiers as Herr Richtertook his seat on the conductor 's stand . The Walkyries rode the storm , and Wotan bid Brunnhilde farewell on the fiery bed . " I could n't stand a whole week of Wagner , " Pallier said to Julian . " It reduces one 's silly old mind to a state of complete vacuity and emotional imbecility . " " That 's about how I feel , " Julian said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thing , however , " said Pallier . They had met on the grand staircase of Saxford House . On themonumental flight of marble that curled up from the pillared hall , the women 's rustling draperies trailed over the red carpet as the stream of guests slowly mounted between rows of lackeys in plush breeches and pink silk stockings . It paused at the door of the main drawingroom , where the duchess was making a heroic stand , receiving the onslaught of the serried ranks with a smile which was becoming a littlehysterical . The duke , wearing the blue sash of the Garter across his shirt front , supported her nobly . He was whispering to her that he had called up reinforcements . Pallier , as the footman called his name , tactfully passed on , while the duchess was receiving Prince and Princess Alexander of Teck , to where Lady Irene Sexborough , fresh and smiling , was coming to the relief of her mother . " It 's about time to change guard . Your mother has held the breach long enough . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embrace the entry of the human race , ' " Pallier said to Lady Irene . " I 'll tell her that one , though it 's not quite in your best taste ; Everard , " said Lady Irene . " You have n't got any new Greek quotations this evening ? " " Has Pallier been dumping his Agamemnon on to you ? " Julian said as he took his turn . " No . The last one was Lysistrata . A terribly naughty one , " Lady Irene said . " I think you 'll find what you 're looking for in the blue room to the right , " she added , turning again to Pallier . " I passed her just now . She 's looking stupendous . " " Oh my queen , I do n't know what you mean , ' as the poet sayeth , " bantered Pallier , while Lady Irene took up her position to greet Baron Harashi , the Japanese ambassador , who was menacing her extended hand with a terrifying row of yellow teeth . Julian located his aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood talking to Mrs. Asquith , Mrs. Gerald Buxton , and Lady Marjorie Sinclair , the wife of the Secretary for Scotland . " Come this way with me , " Pallier said to him , " before you answer the call of duty . I want to introduce you to Kattie . " " Kattie " was Lady Katherine De Nivelle . She was not hard to discoverin the apartment which Lady Irene had indicated . In white and silver , with a small tiara of diamonds on her light brown hair , she dazzled an admiring circle that gravitated within the orbit of her splendor . At her side , Lord De Nivelle , with reddish beard and still redder aquiline beak , was talking to Baron d'Erlanger and the Duchess176 EUROPAof Portland . Lady Katherine caught sight of Pallier almost as soon as he had entered the room , but did not betray the fact by a glance . Presently Lord De Nivelle , while engaged with the Gaekwar of Baroda and Sir Havillard Chausemarez , the authority on Eastern history , excusedhimself , and Lady Katherine turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceived him . " I have only one moment , " she said , stepping aside with him , " while Dicky is being presented to the Crown Prince of Siam . He is crazy about Orientals . I ca n't stand the monkeys , myself , and always get out of shaking their clammy hands . It gives me a nasty feeling all the way down the back . " " I want Julian Bern to meet you , Kattie , " he said . " He 's a good friend of mine and a profound philosopher . I believe he is at present engaged in fathoming the mystery of woman . " " Sorry you have taken on such a hopeless task , " Lady Katherine said . " Burt if I can be of any assistance in your researches , I am alwaysready to sacrifice myself for the cause of science . Everard has spoken to me about you , " she added with a charming smile . " Do n't you think we could arrange a little bohemian luncheon ? " Pallier said . " Tout-et-fait canaille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You might get Lady Irene to chaperone you . " " Everard has always ideas of grandeur , " Lady Katherine said . " I do n't see how it 's possible , my dear boy . You must come and see me at Cavendish Square , however , Mr. Bern . Will you take me to see whether Dicky has detached himself from the Siamese twin , Everard ? " Julian , taking the hint , left them and proceeded towards Lady Penmore . He found her seated with the Countess of Trefoil , Lady Cope and two other dowagers . She was asking Lady Cope about her daughter . " Poor Claudine is terribly disappointed at not having been able to come , " Lady Cope was saying . " She has to go under an operation for appendicitis . There 's an appalling epidemic of the complaint ever since the King was operated . Our own doctor had been treating her all along for constipation .

And I 've been constipated for over thirty years , soTHE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 177I know what I am talking about . Claudine , poor girl , who has had such a lot of trouble , was to be presented this year . Fortunately , with the King of Denmark dying and the court in half-mourning , she could n't have gone to the Palace in any case . She 'll enjoy it much betterwhen her inside is fixed up . Was n't it good of the dear Queen to do as she did ? She was terribly annoyed with her father for ( lyingjust now . Just at the beginning of the season . But she was determined that everything should go on as usual . She told the Duchess of Saxford that she was on no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the opening of Parliament , Aurora ? I think the purple dresses of the peeresses were really most becoming . " Baron and Baroness Rubinstein were standing near by talking to the Prince of Teck . The baron 's pink face and close-curled hair and beard , so light that they gave the appearance of being white , made him look like a Paschal lamb . He was expressing his pleasure at the safe return of the Prince and Princess of Wales from their adventurous journey round the empire . " May has borne the fatigues and hardships remarkably well , " the prince said . " No sooner had she got back than she set to supervising the preparation of the yearly supply of marmalade . " " Her Royal Highness must have an iron constitution , " said BaronessRubinstein . " I have always to rest for several days after a journey . I used to look forward with positive dread to the Orient Express to Vienna until we got our own railway carriage . It makes it so much more possible , with one 's own servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I have never myself travelled in such luxury , " said the prince . The attention which he made a point of paying to the baron was an acknowledgment of the banker 's helpfulness when the family had been in financial straits . The baron remembered finding Princess May trimmingher own hats when he had called on the Tecks in Florence . " She looks as if she still did , " was the baroness 's comment . The prince himself had had to go about in cabs , and to wear his last season 's evening clothes . The financier never ventured , however , to presume in any way or to indicate the extent of his great power , and his humble , kindly , and patient attitude ingratiated him in the highest circles . Baroness Rubinstein made up for her husband 's modesty and discretionby an arrogance which verged upon vulgarity . In spite of this and of other unpleasant characteristics , she was tolerated , on account of her amiable spouse , and was even admired by the younger set of women178 EUROPAas being smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather chic than regularly aesthetic , exercised considerable attraction on the men , and was consequently imitated by the women , who copied the arrangement of her eyebrows and her hair and the curl of her lips . The sumptuous toilette of champagne-colored eolienne , with gold Louis XV buckles , which she was wearing eclipsed the attire of the duchesses , and the tiara of diamonds that crowned her raven-black tresses was worth a king 's ransom . Esther Rubinstein was , however , a loyal and useful helpmate to the baron , and he valued her intelligent co-operation in the social diplomacy which his far-flung enterprises called for . She had cultivated the friendship of Lady Penmore , whose important fortunewas not to be neglected with reference to the extensive Russian loans which the baron , in association with the Rothschilds , was at the time engaged in raising , the Tzar 's government 's need for ready cash being a veritable Danaids ' cask , whose ceaseless requirements tasked to the utmost the ingenuity of European financiers . Catching sight of Lady Penmore , Baroness Rubinstein waved her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Prince of Teck had turned away to speak to Lady Maude Warrender , the baroness went over to speak a few words to Lady Penmore , while the baron went to greet Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich and his wife , Countess Torby . Lady Cope was still talking . As she was extremelydeaf , the stream of her conversation , once set flowing , was difficult to arrest , since she was for the most part unaware of replies and interruptions . Her last remarks were uttered while Baroness Rubinsteinwas simultaneously addressing Lady Penmore , and it was some time before Lady Cope noticed the circumstance . " I did not like at all the way the peeresses dressed , " said the baroness , referring to Lady Cope 's last remarks . " The extreme decolletage was unbecoming . It was carried too far . I am quite sure that the Queen did not approve . It is terrible to think of Englishwomen adoptingthose extreme fashions . The Paris couturiers are now even doing away with high collars in afternoon costumes . " " They ca n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last words , " because the Queen has to wear her dog-collar , you know . By the way , have you heard , my dear , that the Duchess of Hochstein has burst her navel ? She has to have sticking plaster pasted all over her tummy . " Julian caught sight of Lady Coston and Dorothy , and went over to THE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 179pay his respects . He must come down to Cranne Hall in the winter , Lady Coston urged . They had had one of the very best seasons . There had been the most remarkable run with Mr. Fernie 's . A fox had been found close to Horninghold , and they had pulled him down after coming thirty miles on a splendid line in the Cottesmore country . It had been a record . Lady Coston had just been talking to Margot Asquith , who was quite vexed that the election had kept her away from the hounds . She was quite ready to break another collar bone .

" I knew Captain Middleton , Bay ' Middleton , as we used to call him , who was given the responsibility of accompanying the Empress , " Lady Coston said .

She used to ride to hounds , taking all the fences and streams , in the style of the Spanish riding school . Poor Bay Middleton was killed in the House of Commons steeplechase . " Julian took Dorothy in to supper . " Were you at the opera this evening ? " she asked . " I saw you at the Ring . ' Was n't it sublime ? This evening Scotti , who took Rigoletto , had a bad cold . But you should have heard Caruso do ' La donna e mobile . ' It created a furore . Melba and Madame Kirby-Lunn are here , you know . I believe Melba is going to sing . " Dorothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing with another girl , one of the Brooks of Wharton . She was studying at the Royal Academy of Music , and was also having lessons from Madame Posada . She had been to Milan . But they had told her that her voice needed to be restrained . She was really a mezzo , Signor Squilli had told her . All her teachers had been under the impression that she was a soprano . Lady Irene Sexborough stopped , as she passed with Colonel Norton , to tell Dorothy and Julian that Madame Melba was going to sing in the musicroom . Reynaldo Hahn had been giving a recital of his " Beatrice d'Este , " but many people , unaware of the performance , had failed to hear it . It was most difficult , Lady Irene said , to cater for everybody 's musical tastes . On a former occasion , when Paderewski had been playing at Saxford House , the King had asked the pianist to play an air from one of Offenbach 's operettas , the only music he18o EUROPA THE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 181liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paderewski , furious , had to be restrained from bursting out before the King . M. Reynaldo Hahn had told Lady Irene that a concert of Debussy 's works which he had given at the Duchess of Manchester 's had been almost inaudibleon account of the din of conversation . " When he had finished , theduchess , who was a Miss Zimmermann of Cincinnati , sat at the piano and sang some negro spirituals . They became quite the rage , andSwing low , sweet chariot , ' and Nobody knows de trouble I 've seen , ' are now as popular in Mayfair as in Alabama . " In spite of the enormous size of the musicroom , all available seatingaccommodation was taken up by the women , and the men stoodcrowded at the back . Julian took Dorothy over to where Lady Coston was sitting . She had room for a chair next to her . There was a generalexpectant hush when Madame Melba appeared . In the silence , Lady Cope was heard to ask the Countess of Trefoil , who was sitting next to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crush of tailcoats at the back of the room , while Madame Melba sang " Chi mi prega , " from " Lucia , " and " Caro nome , " Julian found himself at Welby 's elbow . He was with Bertie Turldey , and atthe conclusion of the music , the two pressed Julian to join them in a spot . Turldey , who had had several spots already , and had with difficultybeen dissuaded from bringing Miss Vannie Lott in the Episcopalcoach to Sax ford House , had conceived an ardent interest in BaronessRubinstein , upon whose person his eyes and his bacchic fancy had disported themselves through a large part of the evening . He hadbeen trying to induce Welby to afford him an introduction , but Welby had diplomatically declined . " The daughter of Judah has the most damned obscene figure which I have ever desired to investigate , " Turldey said . " What rumpsteakbath the daughter of Israel ! Vannie has a commendable situpon . But the Israelitish woman hath the full moon . Her breasts , which she ungenerouslyfails to display as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned Holy Scriptur  --  ike two sucking pigs .

" " I can tell you that it is n't a bally bit of good your getting excited over Esther Rubinstein , old man , " Welby said . " She 's a prude . Prudeis not the word . There ai n't no bally word for it . She is a whole VigilanceCommittee of Public Morals . She goes about discovering improprieties . If she had her way she 'd be sticking fig-leaves everywhere and turning all the nice pictures of pretty ladies with their faces to the wall . She actually does it whenever she gets a chance . It is a sort of Voodoo with her . Some Jewesses are like that , do n't you know . " " I call it a damn sin ! " Turldey declared . " Such a waste of good meat .

I wo n't mention any names , because it is n't done among gentlemen . But I treated myself to a comprehensive survey of a lady who is at the present moment not twenty yards away . Hoop-la-la ! If only I could inspect the Kosher Hebraic meat ! " " Not bloody likely ! as the poet says , my poor Bertie , " said Welby . " Besides , do n't you know that Esther Rubinstein is a bitch ?

" The mater always gets Hopkins to count the silver after she 's had the Rubinstein woman to dinner . At her favorite restaurant in Vienna , in the Kolschitskygasse , all the spoons are stamped Gestohlen ' under the proprietor 's name . There was quite an unpleasant affair once when the baroness lifted some stuff at Harrod 's . The head manager , when he found out who it was , had an awful trouble in hushing up the business , some of his underlings having ignorantly notified the police . It cost old Lazar Rubinstein a pretty penny , I bet . Of course , in the shops where she is known , they are only too pleased .

" There 's always something queer about a woman who does not take sufficient amatory exercise. 182 EUROPA THE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 183Either they have vices , or hysteria , or religion , or political views , or literary talent , or something . " " Perhaps Cousin Julian can explain , " Welby said . " He goes in for all sorts of terrible learned stuff . He cuts up animals and things . " " I should like to cut up a woman , " said Turldey . " I say , since you are a bit of a doctor , I wonder whether you could tell me if it 's a fact that Jewesses . . . " He was interrupted by Pallier , who came up at that moment . " I 've been looking for you everywhere , " he said to Julian . " What are you doing , imbibing in masculine company while beautiful ladies are pining for your presence ? " As he and Julian moved off towards the main room , Pallier said : " I have fixed up that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She wants to see you , so that you can arrange the details with her . " " I hope that you have fixed up more than the lunch , " Julian said . Pallier did not reply , looking down with a faint smile . But he seemed extremely happy . Lady Irene Sexborough was , Julian thought , one of the most charminggirls he had met . She was so utterly natural and apparently devoid of affectation , not even the affectation of appearing unaffected , that he felt from the first moment as completely at ease with her as if he had known her for years , a thousand times more at ease , he reflected , than with any little bourgeoisie , with whom conversation was always more or less of a conscious effort . The Sexboroughs and the Palliers were , Lady Irene mentioned to Julian , more or less remotely related . The Palliers were , of course , of Norman stock and in fact closely related to the Plantagenets . The family title of Bar , which to ignorant persons had a Scottish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associate with the West Riding of Yorkshire , was in reality from Barfleur , the port from which William of Normandy had , by the permission of the Lord of Bar , set out for the conquest of England . " Many people have the impression , " said Lady Irene , " that our name of Sexborough , and more especially the title of Saxford , ' have to do with the Saxons . That is entirely incorrect . Sexborough ' is Six bourgs , ' and Saxford ' is , of course , Six forts ' ? nothing to do with fording rivers , like Oxford , which is a local peasant English title . " A little desultory and stately dancing was going on in one of the side rooms , where Mr. Alfred de Rothschild 's band , which was muchsuperior to Gottlieb 's , was playing . The place was too crowded to permitof much terpsichorean evolution . Julian had the pleasure of dancinga little with Lady Irene , while they talked . She was a gorgeous creature . As she stepped round with his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose a superb pair of breasts whose protruding sphericity was exhibited to the best advantage by the action o f her corsets . He was perplexed to understand by what means the prescriptivelimits of exhibitionism , which appeared to be approached within less than a hair 's breadth , were preserved , and he felt some nervousness , which Lady Irene did not appear to share , lest at any moment an accident should occur . She seemed entirely to ignore his interest in her mammary glands . When she had to leave him in order to wait on Princess Louise , who was departing , Lady Irene introduced Julian to the Vicomtesse De Ilouthem , a rather homely , but pleasant and good-natured woman , the wife of the Belgian ambassador . The vicomtesse was afflicted with a pronounced facial tic which caused a sudden sharp spasm of the musclessurrounding her right eye . This appeared startling until one becamehabituated to the mannerism , and imparted an hilarious tone to her conversation . It had been an extremely enjoyable evening , Julian remarked by way of a conversational gambit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to enjoy themselves , " the vicomtesse said . " In my country there would have been at an eveninglike this a great deal more amusement and fun . " She gave Julian a violent wink . " Well , " said Julian , " a great part of the conversation which I have heard this evening has been verging upon allusiveness , and that of the men has been downright lewd . " " Ah , of course , of course . It is always like that everywhere . Que voulez-vous ? C'est la vie . But we Flemish are not so restrained . We are more spiritual . " The vicomtesse gave another wink . " Yes , I know what you mean , " Julian said . " People are plus spirit:lelsin their conversation . Except the unmarried women , however . With us it is the other way about . The young women are , in general , more spirituelles in England . " " That is true . Our jeunes fines are in convents and it is therefore impossible for them to be spiritual . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The vicomtesse completed the apoiopesis by a series of winks. 184 EUROPABefore taking her departur  --  he rooms in Saxford House were now beginning to empt  --  he vicomtesse hoped that Julian , if he were ever in Belgium , would not fail to visit her at her place at Antwerp or at Laeken . " I can promise you we should give you a very good time , " she said with renewed spasms of her ocular muscles . What strictures might not the little Flemish lady have passed on the dullness of Aunt Aurora 's lunches , Julian thought as , a day or two later , he strolled over with Pallier to Half-Moon Street . On the postulatethat men were more intelligent when undistracted by the presence of women , and overlooking the limitations imposed on their expansivenessby her own somewhat fussy presence as their hostess , Lady Penmore lay great store on her masculine lunches , which , being neither truly masculine nor stimulated by feminine company , were generally incredibly dull . In the red-brocaded drawingroom overlooking Park Lane , an enormousclock , indecently exhibiting its insides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the two balcony windows flanked by bowls of artificial fruit . The room was filled , as Julian and Pallier were announced , with the low-pitched rumble of the conversation , and with a grave assemblage that looked like a party of mourners awaiting the screwing-down of the coffin , as they glanced impatiently at the clock , waiting for the food . " We are having a quite particular treat , " Lady Penmore said in an intense whisper to Pallier as she greeted him , " the greatest intellect in England , as profound as a philosopher as he is great as a statesman . You will be interested to meet Mr. Arthur Balfour . What a brain the man has , what a brain ! " A group was standing in a half-circle round the great man , who , his head a little to one side and slightly bowed with the weight of thought , stood balanced on one foot , his hands hanging to the satin lapels of his flowing frockcoat . " That is extremely interesting , if I may say so , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , speaking with a very precise Oxford accent , had been giving some account of the opening of the Russian Duma , which he had witnessed a few days before . " The intelligent liberal policy of the present Tzar , who appears to be followingin the footsteps of his enlightened grandfather , the emperor AlexanderII , marks for Russia a new era , " Mr. Balfour said , " if indeed theTHE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 185mystic Russian soul will prove able to adapt itself to the progressive institutions of Western democracy . " " It was quite an unprecedented spectacle , " said the precise young man , " to see hundreds of bearded mujiks in their blouses and heavy boots , with their big hands and black fingernails , in the throne room of the Winter Palace . They did not seem in the least abashed by their surroundings , rather the contrary . The Constitutional Democrats , who , by a pun on the initials of their designation , are called the ' Cadets , ' arrayed in all the brilliancy of court dress , decorations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled very wry faces . " Mr. Balfour smiled wearily . " The Russian peasant is essentially loyal to the dynasty , " he said . " Count Tolstoy represents , to my mind , the true spirit of the Russian masses . I have always thought of him in the phrase applied by Goethe to Spinoza , as a God-intoxicated man . " " Qu'est ce qu'il ditP " asked Mundurus Pasha , the Turkish ambassador , whose red fez crowning his pock-pitted face lent a picturesque touch of color to the company . He did not understand English well . Mr. Agg-Gardner , who was at his elbow , interpreted . " Hm ! The mujiks are more often intoxicated with vodka , " said the Turk . " I do hope that the great improvement in the state of Russia will have a favorable effect upon the finances of the country , upon Russian bonds , " Lady Penmore said to Baron Rubinstein , who sat down next to her on the chesterfield . " The wealth of Russia is good security , " said the banker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be developed thanks to British enterprise , will increase in value . Count Witte found , it is true , the European market a little shy owing to all these disturbances . But I have it on good authority that a strong policy and a reorganisationof the police have been made by European financial interests a condition of accommodation . " Julian seemed to remember the face of the young man who had been speaking to Mr. Balfour . As the latter became engaged in conversation with Sir Raphael Mendel , the young man came up to Julian who recognised in him Sylvia Chantry 's friend , the Honorable Leopold Dexter , whom he had met while skating in Leicestershire . " We have met before , I think , " Dexter said . " Have you seen anything lately of our friend Miss Chantry ? " 186 EUROPAJulian had not . After her mother 's death , which had taken place shortly after Julian 's first visit to Leicester , Sylvia had gone abroad , and we had quite lost sight of her . " You are still in St. Petersburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was there until a few weeks ago , " Dexter said . " But in the present confused state of things there , I scarcely know whether I shall be going back . " He spoke of the chaos of the country , the riots , the strikes which were paralysing industry , traffic , and the food supply . In the country things were worse . He had seen families which had been subsisting for over a year on nothing but cucumbers . Many people were leaving St. Petersburg . The dowager Empress was staying on at Copenhagen . Nearly all Russian society was abroad . Lunch was announced . Lady Penmore led the company down with Mr. Balfour . During lunch , Mr. Gerald Loder , who was sitting next to Julian , twitted Sir Raphael Mendel about Chinese slavery in the Rand . " The term , " said Mr. Balfour , coming to the rescue of the mining magnate , who was accused of living mostly in Park Lane , " can not be applied without risk of terminological inexactitude . " " The whole agitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large interests in South Africa , " said Sir Raphael . " Their agent is a wretched little baboo attorney called Gandhi . " " A great friend and disciple of Count Tolstoy , " Dexter said . " The journey of the Prince and Princess of Wales to India , " said Lady Penmore , " has produced such a splendid demonstration of Indian loyalty . Welby , who knows India wel  --  e was at the Durba  --  ays the Indians are magnificently loyal . Are n't they , Welby ? " " Oh , rather , " Welby confirmed . " The niggers just bally well lick our boots . They love it . " Baron Rubinstein spoke about the unpleasant manners of the Germansat the Algeciras conference . " The King ought to take a firmer hand with that young nephew of his , the German Kaiser , " Lady Penmore thought . " He is a positive danger to the peace which England is above all anxious to preserve . " " There is no danger whatever , Lady Penmore , " said Mr. Balfour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future we shall not see wars , unless , indeed , we can conceive of a ruler or nation breaking the peace by tramplingon the rights of their neighbors . I see no prospect of such a calamity . And I may perhaps claim that the administration over whichTHE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 187I have had the privilege of presiding has contributed not a little to that gratifying result . The alliance which the late government of this country has concluded with the progressive empire of Japan , and which , if I may say so , I am proud to think was one of the last acts of my administration , was not generally known when the country saw fit , in a moment of aberration , to entrust the helm of affairs to less experiencedhands . " " It is scandalous , the ignorance of the people ! " said Lady Penmore , flushing with indignation under her cold cream . " How humiliating it must be to a mind like yours , Mr. Balfour , that the country should be so blind and ignorant as to deprive itself of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Balfour modestly cast down his eyes . He was engaged in vigorouslyopposing the Government 's education bill and in upholding the immemorial privileges of the Church of England . " The fact remains , " said Sir Raphael Mendel , " that Germany has a growing balance of trade of over twenty-one and a half millions against us . " The footman standing behind Julian 's chair whisked away the plates . " Bern is feeling a little tired , I think , " Pallier said to Welby when Lady Penmore rose . " I think we had better leave early . We have to be at Lady Castle 's for tea . " " Oh , you must n't go yet . Come over and have a whiskey-and-soda . It will do Julian good , if he 's off color , " Welby said , hospitably . Leopold Dexter joined them in the smokingroom . " Ca n't stand bally politics , " said Welby as he helped his guests . " Do n't blame you , " Pallier said , " after the specimens we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an everlasting wonder to me how poor old England manages to muddle through at all . Almost makes one believe in an English God . Still , I suppose you have to go in for politics a little at your embassy in Vienna ? " " The devil I do , " said Welby . " There 's quite a good golf course at the Prater . The old man is frightfully decent , though . Says I 'm bally invaluable in cultivating international relations by keeping the younger Archdukes and the johnnies at the Ballplatz in good humor , and all that , do n't you know . " " I was at the Metternichgasse myself once , " piped up Dexter . " Spent a year under the shadow of der alte Ste file . ' It 's a quite charmingplace. " 188 EUROPA THE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 189 " Not half bad , " Welby conceded . " I 'm not much gone on bally foreignersmyself . But those Viennese chaps , I must say , are the boys . And the women ! " " They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backsides , " Welby completed . " Their diet of sausages , potatoes , and doughy Mehlspeise is conduciveto callipygous rotundity , " Dexter smilingly admitted . He and Welby exchanged notes . Yes , Frau Sacher still presided , with her jewels , cigars , and bulldogs , over the Habsburg revels . " Still , I fancy that the old Habsburg exuberance is not all that it used to be . Archduke Otto , I suppose . . . ? " " Is dying of pox , in a horrible state , " Welby informed . " You have heard , of course , of his charmingly unconventional pranks ? " Dexter queried , turning to Pallier and Julian . They had not . " I thought they taught history at Cambridge , " Welby remarked . Dexter told them about Otto 's appearance at Sacher 's attired solely in his sword-belt and gloves , to the distress of the British ambassador and Lady Dutton who happened to be dining there . " There is a file of correspondence at the Metternichgasse about the diplomatic incident . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry an extremely pious and prudish Saxon princess , the Princess MariaJosepha , entertained a company of his friends , who had been carousing at his hunting lodge at Schoenau , by driving them to his Vienna palace , introducing the gay party into the connubial chamber , and forcing the pious lady , who was calling on the Holy Virgin and all the saints , to remove her nightdress for their entertainment . " All the same , as I was saying , the Habsburg lads , though still regarding the world as existing for their personal entertainment , have never quite recovered , I fancy , from the accident to the heir apparent , Prince Rudolph , " Dexter said . " He was an ornithologist . " " A connoisseur of birds , " Welby elucidated . " Was gone crazy on Mrs. Langtry . " " Iie committed suicide , did n't he ? " Pallier queried . " They called it suicide , and strictly speaking it was , " said Dexter . " But there was a great deal more to it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King Leopold . There was some vague vision of an ultimate union of the Holy Roman Empire with the empire of the Congo . " " One 's as good as the other , " said Pallier . " Princess Stephanie , the Congo heiress , was not gifted by nature , " Dexter went on . " Dry as a broomstick , " said Welby . " Prince Rudolph , who mostly took his pleasure elsewhere , had the misfortune to suffer a mutilation at the hands of a little Greek girl , Marie Vetseras , " Dexter related . " Slashed off everything with a razor , " Welby specified . " Which operation has , I imagine , had a sobering influence upon the whole Habsburg line , " Dexter said . " Not a bit of it , " said Welby . " Young Karl , Otto 's son , who , should anything happen to Archduke Franz Ferd , might be the next Emperor , is as lively as the rest . Caught the Habsburg complaint from his father through the intermediary of a Polish lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His latest passion was for a Jewess , Frau Bland , a favorite singer at the opera-house . Karl stole his mother 's diamond tiara to present it to the Bland lady , who wore it while singing in The Queen of Sheba .

" " Oh , come , come , " said Dexter . " The Gnadige , ' who was provided by the Empress herself to entertain the Emperor , tucks him up in bed and brings him toys from Paris . The old boy was once taken round , while I was in Vienna , to inspect the manoeuvres of his beloved , unvictoriousarmy , and was trudging among the bushes when he came upon a couple engaged in the practice of the arts of love . Stopping , perplexed , he turned to his suite , gravely enquiring : Mocha de Leit no alavar des @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ca n't say that I 've seen much of him , do n't you know , " Welby said . " I 've attended the Hofball , when he is gingerly brought out and asks each of us of the diplomatic corps : How do you like Vienna ? ' while he examines attentively the polish of his boots . There was an awful row , by the way , that time . It was not long after the Tzar 's visit , and Russians , following his lead , were a good deal in evidence . The Russiansand the Austrians love one another like cats and dogs , you know . There were two Russian girls , a grand duchess and her sister . I must say I 've never set eyes on anything quite so scrumptious . Enough to drive a fellow crazy , by Jove. " 190 EUROPA " That must have been either the Duchess of Kronstadt or Grand Duchess Isidore , " said Dexter . " That 's it , the Grand Duchess Isidore and her sister , Princess Hruzof , " Welby said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anitshkov Palace and at Countess Kleinmichel 's , " Dexter said . " Their mother , the Duchess of Friedland , was once famous for her beauty . Grand Duke Isidore was drowned at the battle of Tsushima a couple of months after his marriage . Prince Hruzof , who married the younger of the two sisters at the same time , is a swine . " " Not feeling well , Julian ? " Pallier said . " You 're looking as pale as a sheet . " " I 'm afraid these late nights do n't agree with me , " Julian said , smiling wanly . " Here , have some whiskey . Let me pour you out a stiff one . No , old man , it wo n't hurt you . I 've felt like that myself , " Welby said . " Thanks , I feel quite all right , " said Julian . " Please go on . You were telling us , I think , about some beautiful Russian girls . " " Let 's see . Where was I ? Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russians did almost come to blows at last . Karl insisted on taking Princess Hruzof in to supper , and a friend of his , a wealthy Hungarian count , who paints the town blue , Berchtold , took the grand duchess . Karl told Princess Hruzof that unless she came to dine with him at the Kobenzl , he would blow out his brains . Count Berchtold was , I suppose , saying much the same thing to the grand duchess , when one of the Russians , Prince Pavel Dadianin , came along behind them and , taking the two women by their disengaged arms , walked them off to the supperroom , leaving Karl and Berchtold purple with rage . After depositing his charges at a table , Dadianin turned smiling upon the archduke and the count . I do n't know how the thing managed to be passed over , but Poldy Berchtold has since got himself appointed ambassador at Saint Petersburg , and has vowed that he would devote his political career to promoting the worst possible relations between his country and Russia . " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his diplomatic labors , it was time for Pallier and Julian to go over to Chesterfield Gardens . Julian rejected with a laugh Pallier 's suggestion that if he felt too tired he might transmit to Lady Castle and Miss Astley his excuses . THE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 191The engagement to drop in to tea was not , in any case , a formal one . But Julian would not hear of it . He felt quite well now , quite well . While Eleanor served tea , they talked about the Saxford House party . " It is too bad that Eleanor does not go out more , " said Lady Castle . " You really should , my dear . " Eleanor gave a tolerant little laugh . " What satisfaction , honestly , is to be had out of that sort of thing ? " she said , looking up from the tea-cup she was filling , to Julian . " Satisfaction ! How often does one get that ? " said Pallier . " If one only did what gave one satisfaction one would lead a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of curiosit  --  hat 's all that one can expect out of most things one does . " Essentially , of course , Julian agreed with Eleanor , and she had as much right to her taste as he had . Yet in a woman the repudiation of mere frivolity seemed to him insufferably priggish . It was the same with that phrase of Eleanor Astley 's that stuck in his mind , about love ? her hatred of it . How could he believe in love , except as that crude physical desire , unconcerned and cruel , let the consequences be what they might ? How could he trust , confide in a woman ? They guarded their interests , their wishes , merely using selfishly , cruelly their power . How could they expect the man not to do likewise ? He felt almost as though he might look upon women with hatred , upon love as an act of hostility , a revenge for wrong inflicted . In a way , Julian admired Eleanor . Her somewhat full-bloomed , Greek-goddess beauty made her appear queenly , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical beauty was of secondary importance , overshadowed by her active mentality . She was herself almost oblivious of charm , indifferent to the point of carelessness at times of elegance and adornment . Her clothes were always in good taste and obviously expensive , but negligently flung on . At times her auburn hair , which was very fine and beautiful , was so carelessly arranged that it easily got out of place . She was so intellectualised in her guileless seriousness , that it would have been difficult to fall in love with her physically , unless in a sadistic sense in which all the crude primitive brutalities should be aroused to smash the smug feminine antagonism . Once , when he and Eleanor had been returning from a very poor play by Pinero at the Saint James 's , he had for a moment been carried192 EUROPAaway by the emotion engendered by the charming intimacy of a tete-atetedinner at Hatchett 's , and the easy harmony of their tastes and judgmentsas they commented on the play , and , as they drove back in the brougham , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disarmingly candid smile , Eleanor had said : " You must promise me one thing . You must not make love to me . It is very pleasant like this , and I enjoy being able to talk with you . But love would spoil everything . " He agreed in a way . But that deliberate and declared erotophobia was repellent , almost like a physical deformity , he felt . It was indeed a perversion , in the full sense of the term , and repellent as any other perversion . It would , however , he felt , have been difficult to convince her . She was intelligent , tip to a certain point , but was obdurate in her confidence in her ideas , which were by no means sufficiently clear and consistent fo justify such confidence . Eleanor had herself told Julian her story . She had quarrelled with her father and severed all connection with him , and now lived mostly with her aunt , Lady Castle . As a very young girl she had had a passionatelove affair . The man , a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the matter . Eleanor was not quite his style . He had been sent off to India , secretly glad , one surmised . He had married not long after a musical-comedy actress . Eleanor 's father , Lord Random , a year or two after her abortive romance , had set his heart upon her marrying the Earl of Humber . Considerable pecuniary benefits to himself were at stake in the proposed alliance . Eleanor quietly , but stubbornly , stood out . Lord Random had stormed , threatened . Eleanor had remained immovable . Her mother , a daughter of Lord Battle , had died some time before . Her father had married again . Eleanor had left him . She had a very considerable fortune of her own , coming from her mother and from her aunt , a sister of the Earl of Bar . Eleanor 's notion that her scarred heart could never again love was , of course , a piece of romantic naivete . It was ridiculous . No , women like her , cradled in wealth and social position , were simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no matterhow honest , tender , and intelligent they might be . A close and durable relation with her might , Julian imagined , be even somewhat trying . She was unconsciously unused to contradiction , accustomed to have everything give way before her . Eleanor sought some " movement " to which she could attach herself , in much the same manner as she might have sought some other kind of attachment . She had at one time done a good deal of " slumTHEDAYS OF IGNORANCE 193ming , " as it was called . Later she had joined the Fabian Society . She worshipped at the feet of Mr. and Mrs. Webb . She spoke to Julian about social reform . What they needed was more political education . People simply did not realise the facts . One should give them facts . " You ca n't get people to see any facts they do n't want to see , " said Pallier . " Yes . People are very blind . But they are beginning to see things better than they did . Education requires time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " Pallier quoted . " My dear Eleanor , it is n't the facts that people read about which make any difference ; it 's the facts which affect the  --  hich affect their pockets . " " I met our suffragist friends the other day at Mildred 's , Marion Prince , Margaret Melway , Katherine , and the rest , " Eleanor said . " They 're getting more wrought up than ever , poor girls . I really do n't see that the vote can make such a difference . But still women must begin somewhere in obtaining decent rights as human beings . " It was all nonsense to say that the whole hateful muddle of the manwomanrelation was because women were not fairly treated . Women , the modern young women , who were always talking about their wrongs and the injustice to their sexe come i gru s'en van cantando for lailikedto represent men as selfish , as seeking inconsiderately their own pleasure only .

And Zena , Zena . She had taken her pleasure of him , just as men were accused of doing , and then it was his lookout , no matter how mortally wounded . His to make the best of it . As with those motorists one heard of who ran down someone on the road and drove on full speed without stopping to enquire . And she had gone straightwayand got married . Yes , perhaps Eleanor was right after all . It was all hateful , hateful . At Taglioni 's , after luncheon , Lady Irene could not stay for coffee . She had to be at the Duchess of Westminster 's reception , and had barely time to change her dress before going to Grosvenor House . Lady Katherine and Pallier would not stay on after her . They were to drop her at Saxford House , and Pallier would take Lady Katherine on to Cavendish Square. 194EUROPATHE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 195At least , that was the ostensible arrangement . A bit thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to himself . They had got a good alibi , at any rate . Baroness Rubinstein was there with Mrs. Dickson-Poynder and Madame de Houthem . Lucky dog , Pallier ! " Kattie " had looked supremely radiant , in her magpie bolero costume with that small osprey hat tilted forward . She was flushed with happiness like a very young girl . Well , well , well . Julian wished them joy , wished Pallier joy particularly . It was wonderful how Lady Irene had managed to glide over the situation , ignoring it as completely as a romantic novelist , while yet appearing as utterly spontaneous and natural as ever . He could not but admire the smooth and finished artistry of her discretion which had commandeered him to play the part of Boccaccio 's friend in the plot without one betraying blink of an eyelid . It had been an all too brief , but delightful little party . They were marvellous in their elegance , those women .

Lady Irene had more brains than Lady Katherine , Julian judged . " Too bad , too bad of me to have to run away like this and leave you standing on the curb a desolate waif , " she had said to Julian as she stepped into the cab . " I 'm a brute . Donna crudele . I promise you I 'll make it up some other time , " she had added with a smile that was enough to have driven a man crazy . " We could give you a lift as far as Piccadilly , at any rate , " Pallier said . " No , thanks , " Julian said . " I really feel inclined for a walk , really . " He strolled on , when they had gone , along Old Compton Street . Bah ! What did it mean , all the lure , and luxury , and lasciviousness ? " All animals , except man , know that the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite right too . What were wealth and power for ? The privileged who had wealth and power knew the purpose of life . The others called the obtaining of wealth and power the serious purpose of life , and scowled at the business of making use of wealth and power as frivolity . He did not belong to the privileged world , really . Therefore he had been being frivolous . No great harm done . He would be serious too . What was it that old Fisher had remarked to him once ? " One has to have a certain amount of social influence to permit oneself to be serious . " He must see old Fisher . He was in town , he believed . He must go and seehim . There were one or two things he wanted to talk over . Those experimentswere really clinching . The academic asses would find it difficult to wriggle out of them . They would ignore them , of course . That was the alternative resource of established orthodoxy . Oh , the monstrosityof it , all the same ! " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear . A queer place , this Old Compton Street ! The Italian shops with salami di Milano , mortadella di Bologna , ravioli , and huge stacks of Italian cheese , and straw-covered flasks of Chianti . Seedy-looking youths were reading the hand-written notices in the shop window : " Camera snobiliata . " A sordid , debased , exiled Italy . In the shop oppositethere were evening suits for hire . There was the illustrated editionof the Corriere delta Sera with blood-curdling , highly-colored picturesof the revolution in Russia , Cossacks slashing at the mob with their sabres . It was a beautiful London summer day , although in the narrow , dingy street , comparatively deserted , the sun scarcely reached . Every one had been drawn towards the open streets , the open spaces . One could hear the rumble of traffic in Shaftesbury Avenue . There was a drum and fife band of the boys from the Arethusa playing . Julian strolled on , musing . In his heart were lees of bitterness . Ile knew the ridiculous cause . Biology , when applied to human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " coot afternoon , Mister Bern . " Julian looked up surprised at the sound of the Teutonic voice . It was the fellow Pfeffer , who gave him German lessons up at Cambridge . " Ah , good afternoon , Herr Pfeffer , " Julian said , stopping to shake hands with the German . " Having a little holiday in town ? " " Ach , I do not much go in for holidays , " Herr Pfeffer said . " You 'll come and have something with me , thoug  --  cup of coffee or something ? " Julian had not had his cup of coffee after lunch . He did not consider that a meal was complete without a leisurely cup of coffee after it . Confound those lovers . Confound Lady Irene . His mouth felt marvellously dry . Wine made one 's throat dry . " Where could we have a cup of coffee ? " he asked Pfeffer . " You know your way about here better than I do . Take me to some place where we can sit down and have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no quite respectable cafes , unless we went to the Trocadero . But if you do not mind , we can go somewhere not quite so respectable , " the German said. 196 EUROPA " Oh , lead on , " said Julian . " I do n't care where we go . " Lucky , he thought to himself , that he was wearing an unostentatious grey suit . Pfeffer 's clothes looked as if he had slept in them for a week . They turned up into Greek Street . Opposite the butcher 's shop where they sold horse mea  --  oucherie chevalin  --  feffer led the way down an alley . There were foreign-looking men lounging about . The big policeman quietly standing by , looking good-naturedly unconcerned , kept his eyes open , one could see , nevertheless , and unobtrusively took note of Julian and his uncouth companion as they passed . They went into a dingy place , opening on to a court , where there was a sort of bar with tea and coffee urns , and wooden tables . Men were about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idioms . One or two nodded to Pfeffer . Queer place to come to and have his coffee after lunching at Taglioni 's with Lady Irene , Julian thought to himself . A man with a serviette tied round his waist came to take their orders as they sat down at a table near the window . " You 'll have coffee ? Or would you rather . . . ? " Julian asked Pfeffer . " I think I will have a mug of Lowenbrau , if you do n't mind , " said Herr Pfeffer . The waiter nodded . " And how is philosophy proceeding ? " Pfeffer asked , a little ironically , when their refreshments had been brought . Such vague questions are irritating . " I have proceeded about as far as I intended doing , " Julian answered curtly . " So one always does . Thus far and no further , " Pfeffer said , even more drily . His patronising manner was decidedly irritating . " I thought that you Germans were born philosophers , " Julian said . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You , however , Herr Pfeffer , do not seem to be much interested in the achievements of your countrymen . " Pfeffer smiled , then suddenly became more serious . He took a thoughtful gulp from his jug of beer and wiped his ragged moustache with ostentatious deliberation . " I will tell you , my young friend , " he said . " I am not interested in the philosophy , or in whatsoever opinions , or ideas , of any whatsoeverof the professors of the bourgeois academies , or of the writers , the literary gentlemen , scribblers , talkers that you hear about . I am not interested , because not one verdammt idea of all those peoples matTHEDAYS OF IGNORANCE 197ters this much . " He snapped his fingers sharply , leaning forward and poking his little eyes into Julian 's . Julian looked at him . " It matters surely a very great deal what people think , it matters tremendously , " he said firmly . " Not what the people who have today the power and the glory and rule and possess the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Pfeffer said with rude dogmatism . " I am afraid I do not understand you , " said Julian . " It does not matter , because whatsoever they think , cogitate , believe , teach , is nothing but one pack of verdammten lies , and can never , never , be anything else . " He brought his fist down on the table by way of punctuation . Julian had been conscious enough of the " verdammten lies , " as Herr Pfeffer called them , Heaven knows , and hurt and troubled about them . But the fellow was obviously unbalanced in his denunciations . The way to deal with lies was to use one 's intelligence , to expose them , to hammer away at truth . In the end , in the long end it might be , truth prevailed . It was certainly not by shrugging one 's shoulders and refusing to be interested that lies were got rid of . " Still , that is no reason why . . . " he began . Pfeffer interrupted him , taking no notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " in the philosophies , the opinions , the views , the ideas of the peoples who have no power and no possessions , who do not rule the world , the servile classes , the slaves , the exploited , the proletarians .

" But unfortunately they ar  --  ell , they are simply not in a position to form competent opinions . It is not their fault , of course , but they are ignorant , uneducated . " The fellow smiled as if Julian were being very simple . " They are not in a position to be interested in lies . Lies are to protect , defend , and to bolster up power and possessions . That is what lies are for . Those who have no power and possessions are not interested in thinking a pack of lies . " " I see . Quite , " Julian said . " But still , that does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education . The lower classes have no opportunity to equip themselves for competent judgments . " Pfeffer took another gulp . Then he said more calmly : " What you say is true in a general manner . It has been true for thousands of years .

" Do you perceive , my young friend , why the opinions of King Canute are not interesting to me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ museum . What becomes of his philosophies and opinions does not matter . He has no future . It is not worth botheringabout opinions that are on their way to the archeological mu-seum . " While he was speaking , some of the men who had been lounging and talking at the further end of the room strolled toward the door as if about to go out , but , attracted by the German 's eloquence , stood listening by the table at which Julian and Pfeffer sat . " Is that not so ? " Pfeffer said , appealing to them . There was a young man in a blue flannel shirt and trousers that had originally been grey , with clear-cut features and sleekly plastered hair , who looked as if he might be an Oxford man gone to seed . The other two men looked like Russians . Julian invited them to join him . The young man , who was called Brown , ordered some beer , and the twoTHE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 199Russians , whom Pfeffer introduced as Mr. Vayterin and Mr. Ogonin , took glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herr Pfeffer 's views .

Brown mentioned that Sir Thurniwall Umpton , when he had gone up to Oxford to deliver the Julius Pluriman lecture , had said that English culture represented the pure Hellenic tradition . " Which is absurd , of course , " Brown said , " since the English are the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel .

As if aware of Julian 's eye upon him , he pulled his cap further over his face . His cigarette drooped from his lips , shaded by a black moustache . Julian gave an imperceptible start . He remembered a summer night , a face seen for a moment in a square of light which fell on a bed of convolvulus . . . another face drawing away from him , blanched with fear . The man called Vayterin was talking . From the conversation which Julian 's wandering attention followed only in part , he gathered that the Russians were holding a congress in London , having been driven out from Sweden and Denmark .

You are still discussing whether you will have a revolution , or . . . municipal socialism . We are not interested in your discussions . We are interested in the technique of revolution .

" Mr. Vayterin paused with knitted brows . " You are civilians , " he said . " We are soldiers of the revolution . In this congress will be established the discipline of the Bolshevist Party , which will forge in Russia the backbone of the new world . " " Ach , my friend , " said Pfeffer , " it is in Germany that is the brain of the new world . Your people is not organised . The German socialists , they are the builders of the social revolution . " The Russians shrugged their shoulders . " Time will show , " said Vayterin . " I must be going , " said Julian . " We shall meet again soon , Herr Pfeffer . Good afternoon , Mr. Brown . " He turned toward Ogonin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . Vayterin started , uttering an imprecation in Russian . He caught Julian 's wrists , gripping them as in vices . " Who are you ? " he cried . " Have you come here to spy ? " Pfeffer and Brown , astonished , had sprung to their feet , exclaiming . The waiter and other men came forward . " Will you be good enough to unhand me ? " Julian said , flushing . Chairs were upset . The man they called Ogonin had not moved . He stood looking at Julian with a mocking smile . " It is all right , comrades , " he said , raising his hand . " Mr. Julian Bern is an old friend of mine . " Vayterin released Julian 's wrists . The door opened and the policemanlooked in . " Any trouble here ? " he asked . " Nothing , constable , " Julian said . " I am just leaving . " The policeman glanced round .

VIIF LEANOR ASTLEY had promised to call on the Koe-Billings in order to hear the result of the deputation of the Women 's Social and Political Union which had waited on the Prime Minister . The successful organisation of the representative and distinguished deputation had been largely due to the energy of Mrs. Douglas , who was now one of the most active members of the Union . She had moved some time since to London , into a house in Saint John 's Wood which she had been acquiring for years , letting it and paying off the purchase money in small instalments . After a ghastly night scene , in the course of which her husband had attempted to cut her throat with a carving knife , she had definitely separated from him . Doctor Douglas , almost continuously under the influence of liquor , was now living with a sluttishyoung woman , a cashier in a butcher 's shop . He was completely in the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduallyobtaining the transfer to her of whatever property he possessed , the house at Norwich and his life insurance . Mrs. Douglas , letting off the upper floors of the Saint John 's Wood house , lived in the ground floor and basement , the rent from the apartments being supplemented by the proceeds of publisher 's advances on her novels and of magazine articles , which amounted to about twenty pounds a year . She now called herself Mrs. Montague-Douglas , having resumed in a slightly modified for  --  er family name was Feverhil  --  he use of her maiden patronymic in conjunction with her husband 's . The result of the deputation had been disappointing . Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman had said that the arguments submitted constituted " a conclusive and irresistible case . " He had , however , no hope to offer to the lady suffragists . There was too much opposition within the cabinet itself to the claims of women . In conclusion the Prime Minister , with a smile , had advised the deputation to " keep on patiently pester-ing . " A mass-meeting had immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Keir Hardie , and Mrs. Montague-Douglas had addressed from the plinth of Nelson 's column . A procession had then formed which marched , with banners flying , along the CharingTHE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 203Cross Road and Oxford Street , to Hyde Park , amid the inconsiderate hilarity of the populace . Pallier and Julian , who had happened to be calling at Chesterfield Gardens , accompanied Eleanor to Bayswater . The visit was marred by a series of untoward circumstances . Mildred was feeling extremely indisposed . She lamented that the condition of her health and the hamperingof her movements by a considerable shifting of her centre of gravity debarred her from taking a more active share in the campaign which was now developing . She received the visitors , attired in a sea-green empire tea-gown , her face rather freckled . The flat in Bayswater had been her studio , the large room with northern skylights , now used as a general sittingroom , being in fact the scene of the artistic activitiesto which , before she had met Koe-Billings , she had hoped to devote herself after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was a commotion in the passage , as Marion Prince , Katherine Croy , Margaret Melway , and Mrs. Montague-Douglas burst in . They were covered with dust , their hats and hair bedraggled , and they were fuming with indignation . At the Marble Arch , they had been hustled by the crowd , which had attempted to break up the demonstration , pushing and shouting the most obscene and insulting jeers . They had fallen out to take refuge in the Koe-Billings 's flat , leaving the main body of the procession to run the gauntlet of the Hyde Park meeting . They were in a lamentable state of disarray . Koe-Billings , who at that moment returned from conducting a Bach cantata in the Parish Hall of Saint Jude 's , in aid of the Gordon Home for boys at Khartoum , showed the ladies into the bedroom in order that they might have an opportunity of composing their persons and attire . The little maid , much distracted , ran about fetching hot water . But Mildred had to abandon her attempt to entertain her guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acute , and she had to be assisted by Eleanor and the dishevelled maid to the invaded and crowded bedroom , while Koe-Billings went hurriedly to fetch the nurse and the doctor . While Eleanor remained with Mrs. Koe-Billings until the doctor should arrive , Pallier took the girls in a cab to the hostel in North Alderley Street where Margaret Melway and Katherine Croy were rooming . Julian undertook to escort Mrs. Montague-Douglas , who , being somewhat stout , was feeling very exhausted , to Saint John 's Wood. 202204 EUROPA " I am disappointed not to have a chat with you , " Mrs Douglas said . " But that must be for another time . I am having all our friends at my place next Thursday week , and you must be sure to come . You will meet at least one old acquaintance whom you will be pleased to see . I have heard great things of you from Harry Foster , who always looks me up when he can get to town . " Harry was at that time at Sandhurst . " They think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He has been appointed special bayonet instructor to the Young Officers ' Christian Union . " The proposed meeting had , however , to be put off . Katherine Croy had been taken in charge for assaulting a policeman . She had formed part of a deputation which had attempted to wait on the Chancellor of the Exchequer , Mr. Asquith . They had made a futile attempt to interviewhim in Downing Street . Mr. Asquith , who had refused to receive the deputation , being at the time engaged with a lady who had been giving exhibitions of classical dancing , had retreated through the back door , and the suffragists had proceeded to the Chancellor 's private house in Cavendish Square . They were met by a force of police , and there had been a fairly lively scuffle . Lady Katherine De Nivelle , who with Lady Irene and other friends had been watching the proceedings from her windows with much amusement , entertained Pallier with an account of the spectacle . The women had been forbidden by the police to step off the pavement on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order were punched back with such vigor that they would have sat down on the pavement had they not been supported by their companions . The police tore down their " Votes for Women " banners . The women screamed and shouted , some became hysterical and sobbed . One fattish woman made a dash for Mr. Asquith 's doorstep , picking up her skirts to her hips , but was chased by two policemen , seized and huddled , screaming and kicking , into a cab . There was a catch-as-catch-can tussle . Hats and " rats " dangled , hairpinsflew . " You , Everard , who have such an adolescent appreciation of garters , would have enjoyed the sight , " Kattie said . Katherine Croy gave the fat policeman who was dragging her on to the pavement by the skirts a resounding whack on the face . She , together with several others , was taken in charge . The women were particularly infuriated at the sight of Lady Kattie 's party tittering and laughing while they watched the fray . They threw whatever was at hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their hats , at the window , shouting abuse at the onlookers . THE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 205 " It 's rather heartless of you , Kattie , to laugh at them , " said Pallier . " You recollect that description in Casanova of the execution of Damien ? " " Do n't be an idiot , Everard , " said Lady Kattie . " If silly women insist upon making a ridiculous exhibition of themselves , any one has a perfect right to accept their invitation to laugh at them . Such a lot of frumps , too . No wonder they want men to give them votes . Men are not very likely to give them anything else . " " You are a hopelessly spoilt child , Kattie , " Pallier said . " Katherine Croy is a very nice girl , and not at all bad-looking with those big brown eyes of hers . " " I do n't admire your taste , Everard , " Lady Kattie said . " She was got up in a lot of arty Liberty ' rubbish , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kate Greenaway look . Absurd middle-class creatures . There were some working women as well amongst them , with shawls , that looked like fishwives . " Pallier went the same evening to Bow Street to enquire about KatherineCroy 's case and had a talk with the inspector about withdrawing the charge against her . It was too late to do so ; bail had already been entered . He had to go and ask Eleanor to help , and she at once went with Lady Castle to see Mrs. Asquith , who was giving a party at her house , and , though not over-amiable about the affair , promised to do what she could . The charge was eventually disposed of without being placed on the list , although the other women received various sentences in the Second Division . Julian and I were waiting at Pallier 's rooms in Great Stanhope Street with Sir Anthony Fisher , whom we had looked up in the somewhat dreary temperance hotel in Bloomsbury where he had been staying , and had arranged to bring over to spend the evening . Pallier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bookpresses furnished with rarely bound volumes . There were etchings , on the walls , of elegant women by Paul Helleu , the portraitist of the girl of the period , charming , tangled , cobwebby lines , hazes of soft hair , of downy flesh , of thready , sumptuous cloth . There were licentious Japanese prints by Hokusai . Pallier apologised as he came in a little flurried , and ordered his man to bring drinks and cigars . He had been running all over the place , waiting in dingy police rooms , interviewing officials . " You have become quite a knight of the foolish virgins " cause , " Julian twitted. 206 EUROPA " The poor creatures ! One ca n't very well leave them in the pickle they are getting themselves into , " he said , picking out a cigar . " This women 's question is a sexual question . It is a question of biology . Much more of your resort , sir , than of the politicians or social philosophers , " he said to Sir Anthony , settling down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meekly , agreed . He talked quietly , giving his views of the nature of sex . Reproduction , like assimilation , from which it was not essentially distinguishable , was , he said , a primary distinctive quality of protoplasm . There had been some fundamental work done lately on the chemistry of living matter . Its properties depended upon the singular size and complexity of compound molecules formed round the carbon atom , which enabled changes to proceed within the moleculeitself without destroying its identity . The protoplasmic multimoleculehad to assimilate and multiply , or else disintegrate . But sexual reproduction was a special adaptation . Sir Anthony cited the famous observations of Maupas . Protozoan animalcules , when they have wasted too much of their substance in active pursuits , seek out wellnourished , plump individuals of their own species , and conjugate with them , thus restoring the even balance of their nutritional rhythm . Sex was merely a device for the rescue and perpetuation of the over-active organism , the male . " Speaking fundamentally , it only interests the male . Females , well-nourished individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale , as high as insects and crustaceans , though , of course , the female becoming gradually adapted to the sexual Mode of reproduction , it becomes a necessity instead of being an expedient . But it is in adaptation to the masculine urge that it has developed ; it is as an adaptation to the male organism that the female requires sex . Does not that explain a good deal ? " " Everything possible has been done so that the sexual urges of the human female should be as completely unadapted as possible to those of the male , " Pallier said . " The savage tabus and superstitious fears of primitive man , the demands of landowning transmitters of property for virgins preserved untouched , have been perpetuated by institutions which require household labor and the breeding of heirs to property . Women have been made pure , ' that is to say , they have been spayed , whereas the masculine sexual urge has remained what God , or , as you say , natural selection and the primary qualities of protoplasm , made it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as gross , depraved , or any other term of vilification that the theological moral vocabulary affords . " THE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 207 " Everything which is termed depravity is normally found throughoutanimal nature , " said Sir Anthony . " Do you remember , Bern , those polychcetes which we were observing , Dodecaceria coiclzaruin , whose eyes develop only when the creatures are in rut ? There are marine annelids , such as Eunice viridis , which at the breeding season develop visual organs round their sexual parts . " " How confoundedly convenient ! " laughed Pallier . " The sense of sight very probably arose in relation to masculine sexual urges , " said Sir Anthony . " And people speak with upturned noses of voyeurism ' ! " Pallier put in . " To demand that the light should be put out is supposed to be the distinguishing mark of a pure ' woman . " I recalled , without mentioning names , what I had heard about Mrs. Douglas . During some twelve years of cohabitation , she had never permitted her husband to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to drink and to minxes , who was to blame ? Douglas asked , when Mrs. Douglas recited the fate to which his brutality had subjectedher . " Civilisation consists in subjecting the lower instincts to the control of reason  --  nd look at civilisation , " Pallier said . " Art and half a dozen other things have been defined as the diverting of animal energies into higher channel  --  nd look at them . I suspect that all the queerness , mental derangement , mystic cretinism , imbecility which appear in those diverted energies are in the main the result of psychological castration . Oh , there are people who believe , quite honestly doubtless , that they have suppressed the chemistry of their protoplasm . They , however , fail to observe that they are quee  --  o queer that they have at times to be put into straitjackets . " Pallier rose to flick quite needlessly the ash of his cigar on a distant ashtray . " It 's not the stark , raving lunacy of Christian sexophobia that 's the real danger . Any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demented fury , their gate of hell , ' their devil dwelling in the flesh , are disowned even by moral theologians . It 's the dementia and humbug which have sunk so deep into the very marrow of our bones that we invent a thousand devious special pleadings to fool ourselves , snatching at every sophistry , picking up every scrap of pretext , assuming countless disguises . It calls itself sane and healthy judgment , aesthetic taste , normality . The really normal man is said to be obsessed ' with sex . Did you ever hear of anyone being obsessed with golf , or cricket , or postage-stamp collecting , or blue china ? Oh , no . Golf , and postage-stamps , and blue china are not ob-208 EUROPA THE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 209sessions ; but the primary animating principle of protoplasm is . And women , spayed by the very tradition which makes them economic dependents , resent being ' treated like prostitutes ' ? observe the bitter vilenessof the word  --  hat is to say , like free women with sexual urges adapted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biological functionof sex . They expect those biological urges to be ' sublimated ' into higher channels of ideal sentiments and respectful consideration , and I know not what other form of psychological castration . They rationaliseand trivialise sex till they have nothing to offer but an inert log which strikes the male with impotence . And now fundamentally derangedwomen are seeking ' equality ' with fundamentally deranged men . " Sir Anthony Fisher , who , being in the habit of keeping good hours , left early , spoke of the sentimentalising interpretations of current natural history . Prolonged cohabitation of the sexes was , he said , extremelyrare in the animal kingdom , and differed entirely , when it occurred , from the anthropomorphic fairy tales which still circulated , in scientific writings . It was the same , he believed , with the descriptions of the customs of savages . " The inexact sciences , as represented in influential learned institutions , are merely apologetics for our established social and political institutions , " he said . We stayed on awhile after he had gone , Pallier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dilemma is to combine biological facts with the humbug upon which our established social institutions are founded , " he said reflectively , as we sank back into the arms of the too comfortable chairs . " Or to have a spring cleaning of our social institutions , " Julian said . Pallier pulled a doubtful face . " Undoubtedly a change is taking place , " he said . " There is a growing class of women who are taking to earning their living . They are more or less economically independent of our marriage institutions . The morals of professional women are consequently entirely different from those of ladies . People used to talk a great deal of nonsense about actresses , the Puritans suggesting that it was the wicked stage which corrupted their morals . It was , of course , nothing of the sort . Actresses were the first professional women to earn an independent living . It now looks as if women would in the near future be earning their living in a hundred different ways besides going on the stage . That is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morality , if the spaying effects of Christian morality wear off . Up to recently , men were supposed to avail themselves of the institutionof prostitution , which has reached a high degree of development in England . " " A disgusting solution , " said Julian . " Agreed . Paying a woman is another way to defeat the masculine instincts , which demand conquest . Our enormous population of prostitutes , mostly of the servant-girl class , is scarcely calculated to exalt the character of British masculinity . There are , of course , choicer Temples of Venus , but they are atrociously expensive , and are thus practically reserved for the ruling class . Lady Cressiden 's establish ment is under royal patronage . You have to be in Debrett to have an entry . I dare say I can introduce you if you wish . Lady Cressiden , last time I visited her , offered me the daughter of an Archdeacon . i : t as you say , that is not a solution . As a result , our men constantly go in for queer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishmentof Lady Cressiden 's , where they have a little girls ' school . All quite in order , with certified teachers . Fellows go there to spank the little girls and to stick pins into their bottoms . " " Women are not even provided with such satisfactions . It is as hard on them as on the men , " I ventured . " Every bit . Consequently they get even more impossibly queer . They take to ' movements , ' or lap dogs , or the improvement of the human race , or Buddhism , o  --  o a growing exten  --  o female friendships . They get generally uplifted , like our friend Eleanor . She had an illness over her first love-affair .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was no doubt esteemed by them and by their womenfolk as a commendableand honorific designation . " Mrs. Montague-Douglas 's sittingroom looked like a second-hand shop , furnished as it was with ottomans of uncertain foundation coveredover with a miscellany of decayed rugs and mangy pelts . The habitue  --  he entertained a great dea  --  ad acquired the habit of testing the legs of the chairs before sitting down . With Julian and Pallier , Eleanor Astley had acceded to Mrs. Douglas 's pressing invitations. 210 EUROPA THE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 211There had really not been time , in the turmoil , to see the girls at all . Mildred Koe-Billings and the bab  --  gir  --  ere doing very well , Eleanor informed them in answer to enquiries . " And here is a friend of yours , " Mrs. Douglas said to Julian , with a smile that made him think unpleasantly of a pimp . For a moment , he did not recognise the young woman . It was Sylvia Chantry .. She seemed changed a good deal . She was older , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a poised , self-possessed , prosperous look about her . Sylvia was looking extremely well in a fashionable magpie tailored costume of good cloth and cut . Julian was merely friendly and polite , greeting her . In the brief exchange of remarks he learned that Sylvia had been spending some time in Paris , that she had now a studio in Hampstead . But there was no opportunity for talk amid the heated cross-fire of conversation . The young women were still in a high state of excitement , indignant at the manner in which they were being treated . " Mind you , " Marion Prince was saying , " what we have done is nothing more than is done by men every day for the most trifling causes , lobbying , interviewing members and Cabinet ministers , heckling at election meetings . It 's done all the time , and not a word said . But when we women do the same thing , it is called disturbing the peace . We are going to disturb the peace now . If it 's pestering ' they require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The movement is entering a new phase that will not be easily ignored , " said Mrs. Douglas , " a phase of active militancy . If pestering ' does not serve , stones will be thrown , windows smashed . " " We shall stop at nothing , " said Katherine Croy , her dark eyes fanatical . " They can imprison us . I 'm not at all grateful to you , Mr. Pallier , for having prevented me from going to prison . Let them . Let them shoot us down if they like . But the parliamentary vote to which women are rightfully entitled will be wrung from the government , if it takes years . That is now the unanimous sentiment of all the leaders and of all active members . " Pallier , who had so often teased the young women , did not smile though it all seemed to him very grotesque . " Do n't you think that you are being a trifle inconsistent ? " he asked . " You propose to resort to unconstitutional methods of violence for the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutionalpowers which can be set in motion in an irresistible ' case , only by the use of unconstitutional means ? " " You are merely indulging in Jesuitical quibbling , " said Margaret Melway , tossing her big Titian head . " Not at all , not at all . I am very serious , and it 's an extremely fundamentalfact which I am pointing out , " said Pallier . " I challenge you to cite any reform of a truly important character , and therefore arousing strong opposition , which has been effected by the Mother of Parliaments , the cradle of constitutional methods , otherwise than by the unconstitutional methods of violence or the threat of violence . The Corn Laws were passed under the drawn swords of the British army . The Reform Bills were passed only when armed revolution had been organized to the last detail . All labor legislation has been placed on the statute book under the menace of strikes and riots . The Afrikanders would never have obtained the generous ' settlement which , despite Lord Milner , has magnanimously been granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the last ditch . Irish Home Rule will , you may be perfectly certain , never be granted unless it is won at the point of bayonets . The pretence of democracy and constitutional methods is the sheerest eyewash . It 's like the Hague and the arbitration treaties . Minor matters of little importance may be settled by democratic talking or by arbitration . But every draft of a treaty of arbitration contains a clause providing for the exclusion of matters held to be vital , and every matter held to be vital has been settled by force and not by constitutionalmethods . " " All of which would seem entirely to justify our having recourse to violence , " Margaret Melway said . " Certainly . But why for the constitutional vote ? Why for constitutionalmethods which you defy , and of which you prove the inanity in the very act of seeking to obtain them ? The vote you want is presumably only a means of getting other rights ? " " It is only the first step , " said Marion . " Political equality is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quite so , " said Pallier . " And it is precisely because the removal of the political disabilities of women is only the first step that it is so stubbornlyopposed . You are indignant , quite naturally , that a conclusive and irresistible case should be waived aside . But have you ever considered that if all reforms which can show a conclusive and irresistible case were carried out , there would not be a single one of our social and political institutions left standing ? Not one . The case against war is conclusive and irresistible . The case against sovereign nations which know no law and render war inevitable is conclusive and irresistible. 2I2 EUROPA THE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 213The case against hereditary property , privilege , monopoly , unearned increment , production for individual profit , the mere living wage , the case against traditional religion , against all medieval travesties of education , are each and all conclusive and irresistible . " " Is that a reason for abstaining from striving after any reform ? " asked Katherine Croy sarcastically . " Of course not , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the consequences of the reform . The removal of women 's political disabilities is , you say , a first step towards the removal of all other disabilities . " " Certainly , " said Margaret . " Women are not only excluded from politics , they are excluded from the professions , from the means of economic independence . They suffer under a thousand social disabilities and discriminations . The case against every one of these is just as conclusive as against their exclusion from Parliament . " " I am glad you admit it , " said Marion . " I should not dream of disputing it . The whole social status imposed upon women is scandalously , flagrantly unjust , " Pallier said . " Hear , hear , " they cried in chorus . " And you are sure that you want that injustice redressed ? You are anxious to remove those disqualifications in regard to the professions and occupations ? In regard to economic dependence , to social subjection generally ? " Pallier asked . " Most certainly , " Margaret and Marion said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are quite able to do it . It is even easier to do than to get the vote . You have it in your power to accomplish your whole program of reform without even troubling about the vote . You seriously mean to accomplish that program ? " There was a murmur of assent . " Then you are prepared to do away with marriage ? You will do away with Christian morality ? You will do away with modesty and pudicity ? You are all prepared to be promiscuous in your sex relations ? You are ready to go naked ? " " Oh , Everard , " Eleanor Astley exclaimed . " I do n't see that there is any necessity to do any of those things in order to obtain political rights , " said Marion . " You do n't ? " Pallier exclaimed , rising and tossing up his coat-tails before an imaginary fire . " That is where you fail to be consistent . They have everything to do with it . Why is it , pray , that women are excludedfrom politics ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their business marriage . Because marriage establishes the proprietary rights of man over woman . What is the meaning and purpose of all our sexual morality , our decencies , our pruderies ? To defend those proprietaryrights . Why do you shrink from the notion of giving yourselves to the first man , of taking off your clothes in public ? Why ? On account of your loyalty to the ideal of those proprietary rights , on account of your loyalty to the claims of the man whose personal property you are destined to be . " Pallier paused . No reply was at the moment formulated . " You say that you wish to remove your political and social disabilities . You are lying to yourselves . You intend nothing of the sort . You all the while are ready to bow and cringe to their injustice . You do not mean to be emancipated from those disabilities and injustices . You mean to be moral and modest . If you really and seriously meant to remove your social disabilities you would not have the slightest compunctionin removing your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You hesitate to be immodest and to betray the trust placed in you by your future possessor in regard to his property ? You do not really mean a word you say . You do not wish for justice , but for injustice . You do not wish for emancipation , but for slavery . " Margaret Melway rose , excited . " Of course you are perfectly right , " she said . " If the disabilities of women are to be removed , marriage and marriage-morality and all the sacred conventions that rest on proprietary marriage must go . But we are prepared to face the fact . Hundreds of us are . I am . I do not fear logical conclusions . I 'll strip naked if that will prove it . " She was beginning to undo her blouse . There was a rush to restrain her . " Are you mad , Margaret ? " Marion cried . Pallier laughed lightly . " You have sufficiently proved your logic . But you see that it is not so easy to be consistent ? Those old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddled , confused manner , they feel dimly what many of you intelligent women fail to perceive . They perceive that when you claim the simple right of parliamentary franchise , it is nothing less than the whole of our social structure which is at stake . Is it any wonder that they refuse to consider a perfectly conclusive and irresistible case ? " " You will get the vote some day , there is little doubt about that , " Pallier went on . " The whole Primrose League will vote for every reactionary measure . But it is not you who will achieve the emancipa-214 EUROPAtion of women . It is not your suffragists , your political organizing ladies , your new women who cut their hair and adopt Ref ormkleid . The women who will bring about the emancipation of their sex from unjust disabilities are women who take not the slightest interest in your politics , who do not attend your meetings or carry banners . They are women for whom , automatically , the proprietary patriarchal rights and moralitieshave ceased to have meaning and authority . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming almost as outof-dateas our formal sexual conventions , as a first step . They are going , instinctively , straight for the goal from which many of your political ladies avert their eyes . And when women shall be sitting in Parliament , they will probably be the bulwarks of reaction against that very freedom which women will be conquering by quite other means . " " Thank you for addressing the meeting , Mr. Pallier , " Mrs. Douglas said , smiling , when Pallier had finished . " Do n't mention it , " he laughed . " I was merely practising for the brilliant Parliamentary career I mean some day to follow . " " The real trouble is , " Mrs. Douglas said , " not that reforms have to proceed step by step , but that people can only be got to take logic in small doses . " " You see , Miss Melway , " Pallier said , " I have no monopoly of Jesuitical sophistry . One can always find a reason for being incon-sistent . " Eleanor , who had promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had to leave . Pallier , who was going in the same direction , went with her . " You need not hurry away , " Eleanor said to Julian . " You are not greatly interested in infants , are you ? " Julian was n't . He secretly marvelled at Eleanor 's evident animal interest in the sight of a newborn human brat . There were differences , after all , between the sexes . While Mrs. Douglas was seeing Eleanor and Pallier out , Julian turned to Sylvia Chantry . " Are you doing anything in particular this evening ? Would you care to go somewhere and have dinner presently ? " Sylvia , who had sat quiet during the discussion , not taking part in it , accepted . Marion and the others were staying on to discuss with Mrs. Douglas some arrangements concerning the distribution of propaganda literature . " Suppose we go to the Austrian Exhibition ? " Julian suggested to THE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 215Sylvia when they were outside . It was a warm day , rather too close for a theatre . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . It was not crowded . Most people were at Ascot . On the lawn wbcre a fountain played , under the trees , it was quiet and cool . An orchestra in the distance played Viennese waltzes . " I met a friend of yours the other day , " Julian said to Sylvia , " Mr. Dexter . " " Oh , yes , " Sylvia said after a second 's thought . " I remember . Well , not exactly a friend . I met him only once or twice . I remember now . At the skating , and you ... " She laughed , glancing at him . Julian laughed too , a little ashamed at the recollection of how foolish he must have seemed . " It seems such ages ago . And you are changed . You were , I think , living in Italy , were you not ? " she said . Julian told her about his life in general since they had met . There seemed precious little to tell . " And you , what are you doing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris . She had not very long since come back to London . " So you got to Paris after all . I remember your telling me you wanted to go there , " Julian said . " Yes , when mother died , I sold up everything , raked up what money I could , and went off to the Quartier . Took a little room in Rue Git-leCoeur , sharing it with another girl , " Sylvia said . She had had a pretty rough time . Had worked at Julien 's . Life classes , trying to copy the style of Ingres and David . They did not have girl students at the Ecole des Beaux Arts . One day a painter called Matisse , who knew the girl she was rooming with , happened in the studio , and saw some watercolors Sylvia did in spare time , little impressionistic views and groups of figures . He was interested . He said she was wasting her time at Julien 's . She began to study color and composition . Several people had thought highly of her work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , there was no money in it . Even the really clever men with an established reputation among connoisseurs had a hard enough time of it . What hope was there for a girl ? Being a girl was against her , even if she had been as good as Matisse or Cezanne , who were practically starving . The dealers looked upon pictures , as so many stock-exchange shares , puffed up reputations for the sake of the English and American buyers , thinking only of the sous . It was all a sordid speculation and money-grubbing , full of tricks and216 EUROPAcheating . When she went round to dealers , hawking round her things , they said they might be very good , they did n't pretend to judge , but she was n't quoted . A few francs , scarcely more than the price of the canvas and paints , was about all she could ever get . Her money gave out . With the little that was left and some loans from friends , Sylvia had come over to London . She had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her style rather lent itself to poster work . She had been trying to get effects of depth and light , and modelling with plain , flat colors . She went round to agents and advertisers . No , that was n't the sort of thing that was wanted . An advertising poster must tell a story . It did n't very much matter about the drawing . People wanted an amusing story . " Something leggy , " especially , something suggestive . That always attracted people 's attention . " I got pretty desperate , I can tell you , " Sylvia said . " There seemed little else for me to do than to walk round Leicester Square or Lisle Street . As a last distracted attempt , I went round to the editor of an illustrated paper with some black and white sketches . They were quite trifling , trashy things , little fluffy women and marionette-like little men . Exactly the things I used to draw at school when I was twelve . The editor was pleased , thought it was an original idea , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tremendously . They had to double the printing of the paper . Since then I have been flooded with orders for little fluffy marionettes , orders from everywhere , from America , paying quite big fees . Often I have told editors that I could do much better things than that . But they would not hear about it . They wanted the fluffy little lady and the little mannikin . They did not want anything else . They could not have enough of them . So I do the little marionettes by the thousand , and people pay almost anything I want for them . Ridiculous , is n't it ? That 's what my art and my studying in Paris have come to . Doing the baby sketches I used to do when I was a little girl . " She gave a little shrug and a dry , bitter laugh . " Sale vie , all the same . I 'm prostitutingmy mind instead of my body , that 's all . " A little flushed , she looked very smart , very attractive . The touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her face was a little harder , Julian thought , than it used to be when he had known her . " You were inclined to look at the black side , I remember , " he said . " Anyhow , I am glad to see that you are prosperous . " She had an impatient , disillusioned movement of her brows . The daylightwas fading into purple , colored lanterns were lit among the trees , THE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 217and beams of changing colors played in the fountain . They sat down on the terrace for dinner . Julian was in the mood to do himself well . ' l'hcy ordered mayonnaise hors d'oeuvres and paprikas , and Wiener Schnitzel , and Julian insisted on champagne . " And you are in this Rights of Women business , of course ? " he said to Sylvia . " Oh , not in any very active way , " she said . " Mrs. Douglas was extremelygood to me when I was in dire tight places . I ca n't forget that , however cranky she may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is always at me about it . I now and then attend meetings and give subscription  --  oreto please her than for any other reason . Because , of course ... " " Pallier put it rather well , do n't you think ? " said Julian . " Why , yes , it 's perfectly obvious . Yes , your friend was quite brilliant , " Sylvia said . " He 's a sound fellow . It 's a treat when a person is consistent and clear . I 'm beginning to think that is the essential , that all the rest follows , " Julian said . " That 's why I am not really much interested in that vote business , " said Sylvia . " It 's quite superficial , clearly , almost childish . Those poor girls , they do n't really understand anything , do n't understand life ... " " The facts of life , you mean ? " Julian smiled . " Pallier calls them the foolish virgins . ' " " Of course , that 's it . A frustration-substitution , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freud , I see , " Julian said , smiling . " Does n't need much psychology to make that out , does it ? It 's marriageand morals that keep women in their place , ' not the vote or anything else . " They had got as far as the coffee . Julian offered Sylvia a cigarette . When she had drawn the first puff , she said : " That gir  --  hat 's her name ? ? Melway , threatening to undres  --  rustration hysteria , pretty obvious . " Julian laughed . " Oh , it was a safe gesture . She knew perfectly well that she was quite safe . It 's always like that . People talk . They talk big about what they are prepared to do , so long as there is no danger of their doing it . It 's all talk . When it comes to the point , people always knuckle down quietly t  --  o the sacrosanct conventions . " " Not always , " said Sylvia over her cigarette . " Everything begins in talk . After people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Ah , it will take a long time to wriggle out of the mesh of the oldai8 EUROPAsentiments and conventions , " Julian said . " Women are least of all prepared to do so . You yourself , now , you would think twice before stepping out of them , whatever you may think or say about the humbug . It 's all very well your talking about walking Lisle Street . . . sounds very picturesque . . . but you know quite well that nothing would induce you . You would n't even . . . Suppose I were to ask you now to . . . to sleep with me . . . you . . . " " Yes , I would , " Sylvia said . She was leaning over the table , smoking , her eyes looking away towards the trees and Chinese lanterns . Her face stiffened a little unnaturally . Julian gave a little gasp , leaning forward . " You mean . . . that you would ... ? " " Why not ? " she said , still looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He called the waiter and ordered a glass of Kirsch . " What 's yours , creme de menthe ? " he asked Sylvia . " No , Chartreuse , " she said , " green . " There was a silence till the waiter had gone after bringing the liqueurs . " You see , it is you who are shocked , " she said , turning to him with a flushed smile . " It is you who are in awe of the sacred superstitions , of the old edifice of the mythical conventions . Naturally . It 's men who are impressed with the majestic , sacrosanct importance of masculine morality . Not women . " Julian , raising his glass , gave a little laugh , sheepishly . He was as usual , he told himself , disposed to be sentimental . He recalled the talk ' with Pallier , the other night , at his rooms . He had been looking at Sylvia with the old eyes of his calf-love , recalling the tremulous , timid excitement of that first kiss , that night at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottage with her books and watercolors , a trifle priggish and precise in her talk . Of course , she was changed ; she was an emancipated young woman . Two years , knocking about in Paris , as an art student . One knew what that meant . Heaven knew how many casual affairs she had had , what her life had been . She was changed . Her face had grown harder . He too had change  --  great deal . " Shall we go down to Brighton this week-end ? " he said . " Brighton ! Heavens , how vulgar . What 's the need of waiting for the week-end ? Why not now , tonight ? " she said . " We 'll go to your place , to your studio , " he said . " No . There 's my landlady close by , and my maid , and neighbors . THE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 21OThere 's no good in giving people an opportunity of making themselves disagreeable . There 're other places , hotels . Dear me , what a lot of fuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little crossly , impatiently . In the underground they were silent , mostly , and as they walked along the Strand , after it had stopped at the chemist 's . Sylvia was quiet as they went up in the lift , and , Julian thought , a little nervous , though she tried to conceal it . He noticed that her hand shook as she stood , after he had turned the key of the door , removing her hat . He looked exultant at her as she stood awaiting his initiative . Oh , there was no occasion , in her case , for scruples or delicate pretences . Sylvia gasped a little at the abruptness of his approach , but opposed no word or gesture . Unchecked , his hands , his eyes had their will . Her face was tremulously blank , her eyes half-closed . Would that the little head could have yielded its secret as did the white disorder , to his scrutiny . She came to his aid , quickly undoing her corset , as he fumbled ineffectually . He kissed , drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprint of the navel , the dark pubescence . Hurriedly he undressed . Masterfully , he conquered the delightful flesh in the spasm of convulsive joy . Sylvia remained passive . She bit her lip , silently , with the pain . In the quiet that followed , Sylvia turned her face to the pillow and broke into tears . " What is it , dear , what is it ? " Julian asked . " Nothing , nothing , it 's only nerves , " she said . She looked up , smiling with an effort through her tears . " Are you sorry ? " he asked . She shook her head . " No , " she said , getting her handkerchief . She wiped her eyes and sat up . " Do n't take any notice , " she said . " It 's only nerves . I 'm a little hysterical , I suppose . " A little later he asked her : " Why did n't you tell me that . . . that you were a virgin ? I thought , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sitting on the edge of the bed . Her breasts stood out firm as she drew back her hair . " Once in Paris , " she said , " I wanted to give myself to a boy , one of the students at the Ecole des Beaux Arts . It took me quite a big effort , but I did n't want to appear silly . When he found that I was a virgin , he apologised , politely , deferentially . I felt so humiliated . " " Well , fancy , " Julian laughed. 220 EUROPA THE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 221 " It 's an idea they have . Part of their idea of la famille , ' the sacred rights . Adultery with married women , as much as you please . But a jeune fille , even a rake hesitates . Tradition , tradition . Frenchmen are frightfully conventional . " " So , you did n't want to run any risks this time ? " They laughed at the unfinished thought . She was gay now . He was joyful of her naked body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , " he said , " it will be fun . " " No , no , " she said , " I must not stay all night . It would be noticed . Presently we 'll take a cab , and you will see me home to my place . " In the little studio in Hampstead , secluded behind the untrimmed planes of a neglected garden , where he got into the habit of dropping in , Julian found delightful hours . But he kept on his guard against yieldingtoo emotionally to the charm . So did Sylvia . She kept him off in a sentimental sense , while yielding physically to , his desire . It meant little to her . Was that all ? It was so little of her , after all . But she was prudish of herself , her individual person , jealously on her guard of her independence . She was as comradely and confiding as she would have been to Julian had no such thing as physical intimacy existed between them . But no more . It made no difference . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimacy was not a part . Sylvia , with a touch of defiance , would declare herself . " You must not consider , " she said , " that I am your mistress . " It was reasonable enough , he thought . Had it not been a quite unpremeditatedadventure , a momentary impulse , a defiant wager even , little more than a gesture ? And if the relation continued , there was no reason why it should either bind them in any way or estrange them . He would lounge with a book while Sylvia worked at her drawings . They would spend hours , talking as they felt inclined , or in the equal intimacy of unconstrained silence , or would talk endlessly . Sometimesthey would go out to dine , or to a show . They went , one week , to the Isle of Wight . Those were their most successful days together . Almost , Julian had the illusion that she gave herself to him . They wandered and ran on the grassy , wind-swept cliffs at Freshwater Bay , in youthful exuberance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retract only more deeply within the bulwarks of her being . No , she never really gave herself . She did not surrender the conscious defences of her independentbeing , and could not therefore surrender her body . The full yielding of herself , the surrender that is called love , could , on the other hand , not be real without the physical surrender . It was a vicious circle , within which mind and body were caught , each frustrated . Julian called to mind one of Pallier 's sallies as he talked with Sir Anthony . " The basic difference between men and women , " he said in biological terms , " is that the sexual orgasm is with men functional , whereas it is with women a secondary adaptation . " Julian , whose own defences against sentiment were often , in the soothing refuge of Sylvia 's companionship , on the point of breaking down , could not help feeling the recoil of her own guarded independence , which produced in him something akin to resentment , to exacerbated antagonism . Sylvia 's defensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she defended herself . Julian 's possession of her was rendered more alien , more lustful , more sadistic . He found gratification in subjecting her , in the indignities which he inflicted upon her . Indifferently compliant , she yielded to his caprices with unconcerned acquiescence , branding them with the tacit disdain of her tolerance . Sylvia struck up a friendship with Margaret Melway . Julian would constantly come upon Margaret in the studio . Ile felt at times , when he dropped in and found the young women in intimate conversation , as if he were an intruder . Julian would twit Sylvia . " You are a littl  --  hat shall I say ? ? desequilibree , you know . " Sylvia 's face would harden a little . " Oh , I do n't think so . Or perhaps we all are . How can one help it , how can one be normal in the hellish confusion of this world of transition ? " " You think it 's transiting ' ? You think it will transit ? " he asked . " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces , all the foundations , the ideas , the sentiments , the relationships . It began to break up in the fin de siecle . Oscar Wilde crumbling down , and then turning , bewildered , to mawkishness , was a symptom . I used to pass the little hotel in the Rue des Beaux Arts where he died , poor devil . One of the last public autosda-feof infuriated bourgeois puritanism . I hear that they are trying to get up subscriptions for a monument to him at Pere Lachaise , now . But everything is groping , groping distractedly for a new direction . Art , for instance . One knows well enough that all the old stuff , the Bouguereaucow-women , and Venice by moonlight , and the pretty-pretty Christmas annual pictures that delighted the hearts of the good old English bourgeoisie , are as dead as mutton . But one does not know yet222 EUROPA THE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 223what exactly is to take their place . Cubists , futurists , **30;3128;TOOLONG , are n't they ? Groping and staggering because the old rotten foundations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same with sex , I take it . Those women with their franchise , sapping the foundationsof the holy family , without exactly knowing what they are about . It 's all groping , groping , and an unholy muddle , just as with the cubist and futurist experimenters . " " Everything goes together , of course , " Julian said . " If sex is muddled , art is muddled . If art is muddled , that 's because sex is . " " They are all detraques , even the greatest , " said Sylvia . " Gauguin had to run away to Tahiti to keep himself from going stark staring mad . Lautrcc , raving with delirium tremens , had to be sent to a nursing home . Utrillo is never sober ; Modigliani takes to hashish . Van Gogh committedsuicide . All driven crazy by the intolerable as soon as they try to be genuine . Rodin has lost his head completely . He is a raving erotomaniac .

Un vrai satyre lubrique . " " I did n't know he had so much in him . He 's not castrated , at any rate , " Julian said . Sylvia puffed at her cigarette defiantly . " We are getting oversophisticated , " she said . " Now , now . That 's merely a cliche . Do you know what sophisticated ' means , exactly ? " Julian asked . She laughed . " Well , I do n't know what you mean ? exactly ! ' " " You should n't use words without being sure of their meaning . Get the dictionary , " Julian said . Sylvia took down the " Oxford " and turned up the word . " ' Sophisticate : to involve in sophistry ; mislead thus ; deprive of simplicity ; make artificial . ' " " Are we becoming deprived of simplicity ? We are becoming deprivedof artificial myths . Are we being misled ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we involved in sophistry ? We are declining to put up with sophistry . It 's not sophisticated that we are becoming . We are beginning to cease to be sophisticated . We are beginning to insist upon being intelligent . That 's why we 're groping , not because we are becoming oversophisticated . " " I stand corrected , " Sylvia smiled . " The worst of it is that meanwhileall intelligence , which is so much needed now , is being smothered , stifled , throttled more and more by mercantilism . Look at me with illy gollywogs , forced to make an ass of myself or starve . The thrice -- damned bourgeois wo n't let the world transit towards intelligence . They wo n't let the world grow if they can help it . They are on the defensive . They know that something has to be done about people growing desophisticatedas a result of the crumbling down of the old rotten falsehoods . And instead of growing more intelligent , there 's a danger of their going mad . " " It 's not in art or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ill everything . Science has been going back since Darwin , " Julian said . He told her about the reactionary academic cliques , about the fellows who imagined that electrons proved the Thirty-Nine Articles . " They 'll be going detraquc too , some of them , before long , will take to the Wisdom of the East or something , and be fit to be put into straitjackets . " Sir Anthony Fisher was considerably depressed and discouraged . It was getting very difficult to obtain funds for the marine station at Liverpool . Nothing was to be got from the Government . They were spending millions on new dreadnoughts , but it was almost impossible to get a penny on the estimates for educational purposes . The liberals were every bit as bad as the Tories , that way . There appeared to be some plot on the part of the Marine Biological Association to turn him out of the Liverpool marine station , or to do away with it . Sir Anthony asked Julian to go with him to the Conversazione of the Royal Society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cromwell Road instead of at Burlington House . There was a great crush . Lord Rayleigh , the President , with Professor Larmor , stood tinder the statue of Darwin on the landing , receiving the guests . Sir Ray Lankester , the director of the Museum , an old friend of Sir Anthony , was doing the honors of the place . All the scientific and academic lions were on exhibition , Lord Kelvin , Sir William Huggins , old Sir Manuel Garcia , of laryngoscopic fame , who had recently celebrated his hundredthbirthday , and was dragged about , looking like a mummy , on the arms of the Warden of All Souls and the Provost of Oriel . Sir Charles Dilke and Sir Philip Magnus were with Captain Ijichi of the Tapanese navy , from the battleship Kashima , which was paying a ceremonialvisit . The whole town was full of Japanese sailors who were being feted . Sir Ray Lankester , immense , of mastodontic proportions , was offering his arm to a diminutive little Japanese doll , the Princess224 EUROPAArisugawa , and showing her the skeleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrew Carnegie . The generous donor , Sir Ray informed the princess , was , they had hoped , to have been present . But he had been detained in Holland where he was engaged in examining the plans for the Palace of Peace at The Hague . " Hee ! hee ! hee ! " laughed the little yellow princess . The monster was the attraction of the evening . " Have you seen the diplococcus , Mathilda ? " Julian heard Lady Cope call to Mrs. HopePinker . Sir Ray Lankester had lately made himself notorious by getting into a scuffle in Piccadilly with a policeman while the latter was taking a prostitute in charge for soliciting . Even a London policeman was scarcely a match for the gigantic zoologist . Sir Ray , charged at Vine Street with obstructing the police in the discharge of their duty , had taken the occasion to deliver an eloquent and fiery address in court , denouncing the hypocrisy and brutality of the regulations on prostitution , and incidentally the infamy and inconsistency of the whole of **29;3160;TOOLONG . When the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and people were beginning to call for their carriages and cabs , Sir Ray Lankester asked Fisher and Julian into his private study , ordered some whiskey and offered them cigars . He knew about Fisher 's irritations and disappointments . He himself had had his full share of them . Only thanks to a certain gift of suave diplomacy and a massive , overbearing self-assurance , had he managed to assert himself , to defend himself . And even now jealousies , underhand hostilities were getting too much for him , and he was thinking of retiring to silence and private life . " In the Middle Ages they used to keep down science by means of faggots and by making scientists retract and do penance before the Holy Inquisition . They use more subtle methods now , but it amounts in effect to very much the same thing . Applied science is useful , that is , it produces dividends . Getting rid of the tse-tse fly , of the anopheles mosquito , and of yellow fever , are mighty good strokes of business for capitalistic imperialistic enterprises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be kept in check , or bribed , or corrupted , or in some manner drugged and stupefied . Scientific thought is the very devil . Pure science has pretty well given most of what it has to give to capitalisticexploitation . And moreover , there is now so much capital invested in scientific processes , that any new scientific development is itself ratherTHE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 225a danger to vested interests . The gas companies moved heaven and earth to put down electric lighting ; the railway companies are opposing by every means in their power the development of automobiles . Hundreds of inventions which are never heard of are daily being suppressed by vested interests . The great scientific progress of the nineteenth century has probably reached nearly its limit . Further progress is becoming unprofitable . It can only serve to make people intelligent , which is a thing to be avoided at all costs . " Intellectual graft ! " Sir Ray continued . " That is the inevitable result of the social and economic conditions under which we live . An honest and intelligent humanity will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He pulled at his cigar meditatively . " When I was young , it was my good fortune to make the acquaintance of an old German Jew who was dying , here in London , from the effects of long hardship and privation , of overwork and poverty . I did what I could to save , to prolong his life . I got him sent to Algeria , to the South of France , and got the most brilliant young physician in Harley Street to look after him . But it was too late . In the short time I knew him , he taught me more than all other teachers , dead or living . He saw more clearly than any other man the disease which is killing the world . His name was Karl Marx . From his grave in Highgate cemetery , he may yet shake the world . " Julian wondered how the solid , insolently triumphant world could ever be shaken by anything , least of all by the thinker . One knew , of course , when one saw things at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole world , that it could not be right while the world was wrong . But one could not put one 's individual life in order by first putting the whole world in order . And so every one had to make the best of it , interested and busy in his own little affairs . After vacation , Julian plunged with renewed intensity , with renewed joy , into the conquest of his world of thought , resolute to win his way to clarity . How serene it was beside the ceaseless strife and jar between man and man , man and woman , the constant duel of being and being , failing , failing always of the unattainable contact . How serene and restful and worth while . The plans discussed with Sir Anthony Fisher seemed to come to clearer focus . Julian would fit himself for the task , take over the mass of material which had been accumulating in Sir Anthony 's hands , and which he , feeling too weary , too old , to make adequate use of it , would226 EUROPAgladly have Julian round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ray Lankester , who had helpfully talked it over with him , was encouraging and confident . There was much to do to perfect the chain of research , enough to occupy Julian for years . He must work . But he possessed the master key of fundamental thought which smoothly fitted into the lock of every fact . How it illumined them . How murky , muddy , confused the authoritative current teachings , quoted with awe , tangled at every step in stark self-contradictions in their effort to fit facts to obstinate , preconceived dogma . Julian visioned the massive harmony of the rounded result . The science of life ! That , properly , was the foundation of all judgment . The Scotch medico , Gressom , had once remarked to Julian , in the dissecting room , that medicine was the real antidote to myth ; you were obliged to look upon human beings as physiological organisms , and not as the factitious spooks of savage , theological , romantic , philosophical , bourgeois-ignorant myth tradition . And why should science , so calle  --  o distinguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pedantic ? That too was a traditio  --  f pedant schoolmen , of Christendom interested in the maintenance of spooks and ignorance . Life ! It included all . It could be made the medium , the material for all expression . Julian recalled with a shamed smile his boyish fancies ? to write a poem . Poor simpleton that he had been ! Yet he would truly realize the infant drea  --  poem , not of mere words and fancy , but of thought , in which his own being , enriched and purified , should be transfused . At times , when dull and exhausted with the nervous effort , he would seek refuge , running down to London , in the Hampstead studio . It was soothing , revitalizing , the woman 's presence . Maupas ' protozoa ! Julian thought , smiling to himself . Delightful , graceful , intelligently stimulating , was Sylvia 's presence , joyfully companionable and friendly . If only . . . if only the secret antagonisms of sex were not between them . Once , when he had dropped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , hastened to put away the oil paints , of which there was an unwonted odor in the studio . He had never seen her work in oils , or known her to do any since she had come to the London studio . " Ah , doing a real picture , a real work this time , " he said . The canvas had been covered . He went up and drew aside the cloth . " But this is fine , " he said , as he looked at the picture . It was , indeed , technically cleve  --  wonderful command of brushwork , of color , ofmodelling . It was a nude , very realistically treated , the florid fleshgleaming . The face did not show , hidden by a raised arm . The turgescentTHE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 227breasts stood up , showing veins round the swelling points . Julian consideredthe picture a while . " Why , " he said , turning to Sylvia , " that is . . . that is Margaret Melway . " He recognized the peculiar color of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting some brushes away in turpentine . He said nothing more . Nor did Sylvia . They talked of other things . He had an unpleasant feeling . He had intended to stay over some days , to suggest a week-end at Hastings . But he caught his train the same evening , after they had dined at Taglioni 's . Still , what could , after all , be more pleasant to him than her company , her intimacy , when after long spells of concentration his mind craved to unbend ? At times a great loneliness came over him . Once Julian had come down from Liverpool with the longing more than usually acute . Sylvia made tea . Her smile was as cheering as the sense of comfort after the journey . She encouraged him , sympathetic , flattering even , when he told her of the small annoyances and difficulties which , in their accumulation , were unreasonably disturbing . " Sylvia , " he said all at once , " suppose we get married . " " Oh , sir , this is so sudden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Julian said . " After all , we should get on as well , I suppose , as most people do who are married . Why should we not ? " " Why should we ? " She laughed again , loudly , repeatedly . " Oh , you duffer . " He felt a little hurt at her sheer levity . She was still laughing ; then she looked at him with quizzing eyes , and the mocking laughter died out . " My dear Julian , I mean what I say . You are a duffer , " she said . " You , with your philosophy , your seriousnes  --  gave you credit for more intelligence . Just because I have happened ' to yo  --  ecause once , when you were a baby , I happened to let you kiss me , because once , merely in the course of conversation , so to speak , I happened to let you go to bed with m  --  ou imagine that it is obligatory upon us to alter the whole course of our lives in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the window and watched for a moment the thrushes that were tapping the shells of snails on the stones . " You 'll be telling me next that you love me . " She gave a little laugh , without bitterness . " Oh , do n't protest . Of course you like me . And I like you . We like each other so well that it is quite superfluous to lie to one another and say that we love . ' I like you so well , my dear Julian , that were I a228 EUROPAromantic young lady , it would require very little self-suggestion to make me imagine that I was passionately in love with you . And I have no doubt it is the same with you . But what is the need , what is the good ? And moreover , I do n't want it . I do n't want to adapt the whole of my life to yours , or to anyone 's . I just value my own life , my own way of life . To be sure , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is what I value most , and least intend to part with . No , I am not selfish . I should be renderingyou a very great disservice if I were to sacrifice ' my independence for your sake , a very great disservice .

To adapt the course of your life to mine would be as great a sacrifice on your part as for me to do the same for you . And why , why in the name of all common sense should we ? We should probably become wholly intolerable to one anotherin a very short time , instead of being quite good friends . There is not one scrap of sensible reason why we should , either in one way or in another , either by quarrelling , or by committing such a fantastic folly as you suggest , alter the pleasant relation . " Julian , who had listened , laughing occasionally , to Sylvia 's oration , rose and took her in his arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You are , of course , a times right . Forgive me for being a duffer . ' " " Pas de quoi , Monsieur , " she laughed . " What about an evening at White 's ? " VIIIN opportune and munificent endowment , unexpectedly bestowedthrough the Rothschilds , saved Sir Anthony Fisher 's experimentalstation from having to close down for lack of funds , and greatly facilitated the plans which he had been discussing with Julian . The generous patronage extended to a purpose generally accounted of such minor importance was prompted by the enormous profits which accrued from the flotation of the Anglo-Oriental Mineral Oil Company , a transaction which had brought millions to its promoters . The company had secured invaluable concessions for working rich fields of petroleum in Russia . The bringing of the transaction to a successful issue had presented enormous difficulties , and was largely due to the ability and energy of Baron Rubinstein . There had not only been the persevering and often unscrupulous machinations of the Americanagents representing Wall Street interests , and in particular of a certain Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed obstacles which at times seemed insuperable in the way of the negotiations . As the baron explained to Lady Penmore , who was able , through his kind offices , to secure on very favorable terms some preferential founders ' shares in the company , the concession , which contained some of the richest oil fields in the world , was situated in the Dnieper region , for the most part on the estate of Prince Gregorie Nevidof . " My brother Bernard knows the prince , " Lady Penmore said , " and I remember meeting , when I was in Rome , Princess Nevidof . " " It is precisely in regard to the princess that the chief difficulties which I have had to encounter arose , " said the baron . " The most valuableportions of the concession are situated on land which forms a portion of Princess Nevidof 's dowry , her father having held considerablepossessions in Bessarabia . Although the prince has , according to Russian law , the entire disposal and management of the estate , Princess Nevidof made every effort to dispute those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian court , who , being in the confidenceof the Tzaritsa , are able to wield considerable power . But her229230 EUROPAopposition would not have presented an insurmountable obstacle were it not that divorce proceedings between Prince and Princess Nevidof , which have been pending f or a long time , are now likely to take effect . In that event the land rights to the most important parts of the concessionwould , by contract , revert to the princess . In order to protect the company against possible disputes , it was therefore necessary to obtain both Prince Nevidof 's and the princess 's legal consent to the transaction . You have no idea , my dear Lady Penmore , what the arrangement has cost me in the way of anxiety . " Baron Rubinstein mopped his pink brow , which had become moist at the very thought . " M. Raffalovich , the able financial agent of the Tzar 's government in Paris , succeeded in persuading Princess Nevidof to give her consent and to promise her signature . The prince , however , is an absolutely impossible man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time as obstinate as a mule . The financial aspects of the affair mean nothing to him , for he has no appreciation of pecuniary realities . But through a childish desire to spite and thwart the princess , he was determined not to give his authority to the transaction unless he were the sole party to the cession of the rights , and was assured that the validity of the concessions , if granted by him , would be in no way affected by the divorce which he is desirous of obtaining . On the advice of Count Osio and Prince Carignan-Johnson , I asked Esther to assist in bringing Prince Nevidof to reconsider his attitude in the matter . Esther has friends in Rome . It was thought that the required adjustment might be more readily brought about in the course of informal social relations than through a more direct business approach . The prince , as you are doubtless aware , lives mostly at his estate of Rocca Romana . He was up till lately in the habit of leading a rather retired life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late , however , he has taken to associating with some of the more dissipated sets in Roman society and to entertaining them at his villa at baccara parties , the prince being , like all Russians , a passionategambler . The mission which I requested Esther to undertake was , I need not tell you who know my wife so well , profoundly distastefulto her . She is , as you know , very particular as to the company she keeps and takes a strict view of proprieties . The society which Prince Nevidof affects is not the sort which she is in the habit of frequenting . His Roman villa has a bad reputation . Esther has , however , a keen business sense . She fully appreciated the magnitude of the interests involved , and her devotion to their successful issue outweighed her natural reluctance to placing herself on a footing of too close socialTHE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 231relation with Prince Nevidof and his friends . I need not weary you with the details . Esther succeeded in her undertaking , and without her assistance the Anglo-Oriental Mineral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether I should have proceeded with the enterprise had I realized the risks to which she was being exposed . The experience was extremely distressing , Lady Penmore , extremely distressing , " the baron repeated with embarrassed emphasis . Lady Penmore indicated by her stiff silence and downcast eyes , which registered sentiments of propriety , that she shared the baron 's distress , albeit she had no wish to be more particularly informed as to its cause . She had had distressing experiences herself . One of her most valuable properties in Bloomsbury had not long since been raided by the police . Lady Penmore had not only suffered consequent pecuniary loss , but she had had considerable trouble in keeping the particulars out of the papers . A wretched sheet conducted by a certain Horatio Bottomley had gone so far as to allude to disorderly houses owned by a well-known titled lady who lived not far from Half-Moon Street , with offensive references to " Mrs. Warren 's Profession . " Julian had , as it happened , been in Rome at the time when the events referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlightenedhis aunt on the subject . During his long absence from his family , his mother 's letters had gradually dwindled from weekly to monthly communications . They were , however , as full of fond solicitude as ever , and abounded even more in pious sentiments and exhortations . Julian had several times been on the point of going to Rome on a visit to his people , but somehowa pressing claim had each time caused him to put off the realization of his intention . His time was fully engaged . He worked intensively . His work with Sir Anthony Fisher called for all his energies . Julian found , as he proceeded , that it called for ever wider and wider ramificationsof research . The task was a more formidable one than he had anticipated . He sought , now and then , relaxation in visits to Sylvia . Their relationhad been much smoother since they had had candid explanations . Neither made any extravagant claims upon the other . They met gladly and tolerantly . He had no vested feeling in what Sylvia might be doing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in a friend , pleasantlyvalued . Often Margaret Melway would be with her . Julian came upon her in the British Museum too , when he went there on some special re-232 EUROPAsearch . She was engaged on an elaborate thesis on Sappho . They had mutually interesting talks on archeology . Sylvia was also fully engaged with her work and with the social and other relations which grew out of it . She had taken to supplying the text for the light humorous articles of which she at first had furnished only the illustrations , and the light touch of her witty cynicism on social subjects had proved as popular as the sophisticated naivete of her sketches . She had even published a book in the same style as her articles , which had proved an enormous success . Editors and publishers were vying to obtain the fashionable chronicles and satires of the popularhumorist who , under the discreet disguise of a pen-name , was now world-famous . Sylvia moved to a studio apartment , which she had had remodelled and decorated to her specifications , in Cadogan Gardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social sets , in literary circles into which Mrs. Montague-Douglas had a gift for crashing , and in the younger sets of the highest society to which editors saw that she got an entry , and where , in point of fact , she was eagerly sought as the accepted chroniclerof the new world of fashion , whose separation from the old conservativesociety was becoming more and more pronounced . It was accounted particularly smart to be alluded to in Sylvia 's columns in the Silhouette , and the Pratler , and her style and sketches often gave the note to Society . Her time was taken up with visits to country houses , parties , excursions in the wake of the fashionable set to the Riviera , to the Lido , to Norway , or Saint Moritz on skiing expeditions . Julian was amused to come upon Sylvia at Sax ford House , and to be introduced to her at Lady De Nivelle 's , in Cavendish Square . " Miss Chantry is a most formidable person , " Lady Kattie informed Julian with her charming smile , in the perfumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her presence at the thought of the terrible secrets she may reveal . " The vague whispers concerning Lady Kattie 's secrets which were wafted about at afternoon bridge parties had reached Lord De Nivelle 's ears . There had been stormy scenes between him and the charming Kattie , whose terrifying appearance , when she turned round upon him with bloodshot eyes flashing lightning , and claws threatening to tear him into small shreds , was rather that of a tigress springing out of the junglegrass . How dared he enter her dressing-room uninvited ? she asked , stepping menacingly towards him , attired in her corset and drawers , brandishing the china water jug as if she were about to break it on theTHE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 233dome of his head . Indignantly challenging her trembling husband , who ducked under with arm raised in self-protection , to substantiate his vile and insulting insinuations , she demanded a humble apology for his insolence in venturing to express the vulgar suspicions of his prurient mind . Had he not offered due satisfaction , she would have extracted it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nivelle was glad enough to accept the severity of the terms laid down by Kattie as a condition of her accepting his excuses . He increased considerably her settlements , and let it be understood that she should in future enjoy greater freedom . In consequence of the nervous shock caused by his brutal conduct , Lady Kattie had , on the advice of her medical attendants , to spend a season in Egypt . Sylvia took on to some extent , with her increased prosperity , the color of her surroundings . The intellectual questionings which had at one time held so much place in her life interested her less . Her realism assumed the tinge of a light-hearted cynicism . Julian regretted at times the quiet hours in the Hampstead studio , which now appeared in retrospectto have had an idyllic peace which had not at the time been apparent . He found compensation in the lure of the luxurious atmosphere which now surrounded Sylvia and imparted a heightened sensuousness to the somewhat one-sided relation . Once or twice he accompanied Sylvia to Paris . She went over regularlyfor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her recommendation of their styles in her sketches being one of their most valuable advertisements . Sylvia had the reputation of being among the most smartly dressed women . Julian 's sister , Viola , paid a visit of some months to Paris in the company of Princess Nevidof . Their mother had often wished to bring Viola , who was now growing up , to England . But the state of Mr. Bern 's health made it equally impossible to think of moving or to leave him . Viola , after coming out of her convent-school , had had a notion of taking the veil . Mrs. Bern , in spite of her pietism , could not help feeling distressed at Viola 's intention . The poor girl had had a lonely enough existence , destitute of the brightness which her age demanded . Princess Nevidof had very kindly offered to take Viola with her as a companion while she spent , as was her custom , the autumn at her house in Passy . Viola derived the greatest benefit from the change . Julian , who looked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sylvia , was surprised at the appearance of his sister , whom he remembered as a mere child , and even more childlike than accorded with her age . In the234 EUROPAflush of excitement , Viola looked almost beautiful . She had been receiving a good deal of attention on the part of an acquaintance of the princess , a certain Vicomte des Pres Salas . The princess 's dustbins were filled with the flowers which , having been obtained by the vicomte from a neighboring kiosk , with the proprietress of which he had made a contract for a flat rate of five francs , scarcely survived the enamored Frenchman 's visits . When Viola went , accompanied by Princess Nevidof'sgroom , for a gallop in the Bois de Boulogne , the vicomte seldom failed to be exercising the horses of his brother , who was a lieutenant in a regiment of Chasseurs . Julian met the little man , whose face twitched behind his pince-nez as did his hands in his tight white gloves , in the princess 's baignoire at the opera , when he called during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were intoxicated with the opium dreams of color and sound offered by the Russian season at the Academic de Musique and at the Chatelet , by the truculent magnificenceof Chaliapin as Ivan the Terrible in Rimsky 's opera , the glamorousscarlet Persian archers of Prince Igor , the amazing Nijinski , who seemed never to come to earth , the ineffable Pavlova and Karsavina in " Scheherazade " and the " Spectre of the Rose . " He marvelled at the placid indifference of Princess Nevidof , who was bored by spectacles she had already seen at the Mariinski theatre , and blamed the Grand Duke Vladimir for having encouraged the introduction of those novelties , which departed from the dignified tradition of the Russian court . Baroness Rubinstein , who happened to be in the princess 's box , could not express too strongly her disapproval at the exposure of Madame Karsavina 's bare legs . " Such shameless immodesty would never be tolerated in England , " she said , " where , at Covent Garden , it is required that even the dancers ' arms should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result than to bring into her life a transient ray , which helped to unfold her somewhat etiolated nature . The vicomte had been under the impression that she was related to the princess and was a young woman of fortune . His interest in her faded off on his discovering that she was a practically penniless young woman . Princess Nevidof had with much kindness helped Viola to overcome whatever disappointment might have been caused her by the vicomte 's change of mind . She had taken her to an astrologer and fortune-teller , much in vogue in the most cultured Parisian society , who had drawn Viola 's horoscope , and had assured her that she would before very long marry a distinguished officer who would cover himself with glory . THE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 235The princess was at the time more than ever drawn towards spiritual things . She regretted that she could not have been in Rome for the festivities in connection with the canonization of Joan of Arc , which would have afforded her more pleasure than the Russian ballet . She frequented the house of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose name was famous in Catholic circles for several works of piety of which she was the authoress , and which were currently compared with the Letters of Saint Catherine of Siena . Her admirers had no doubt that Madame Svetchin was a saint , and were insistent in their representations to the Vatican for her official canonization. llcr salon was the meeting place of Catholic society , both Russian and French . Madame Svetchin was a little , stoutish lady with lifeless flaxen hair and a poor complexion , who wore a fadeless smile , which was supposedto radiate the peace and happiness of her soul . The ladies who gathered at her house did not engage in any specific spiritual activities or discourses , holding , in accordance with the teachings of the holy woman , that the common and trivial things of daily life had a spiritual content of " beauty and happiness " no less than the highest mysteries of ecstatic revelation in which the soul was brought into rhythmic harmony with the Divine . The conversation at Madame Svetchin 's did not appear to differ from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the weather , the " diabolo " competition which had lately been held at a charity bazaar in aid of the sufferers from the floods in Provence , or the migrations of the Russian Grand Dukes between Paris and the Riviera . Such conversational exchanges were upon the same level as the works of Madame Svetchin , which might have been written by a somewhat feeble-minded child of twelve . But those trivialities were felt to be instinct with a sense of inner peace , harmony , and beauty , which filled the faithful with a tremulous emotion they could scarcely control . On a particularly vile rainy and muddy day , they would remark upon the " beauty " of the weather , and Madame Svetchin , with her ineffable smile of inner peace , which the world can not give , would say : " Do you not love the beautiful rain ? " Despite her claim to possess the secrets of " inner health " and of bodily harmony and happiness , which were supposed to overflow in a constant irradiating stream from the spiritual rhythm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sustained by the almost superhuman effort of her will in the presence of her admirers , was a martyr to almost unremitting suffering , beingafflicted with agonizing neuralgias and neuritis of the spine , which compelled her to spend most of her time in bed . She was shaken with236 EUROPAuncontrollable crises of tears due to undefined feelings of suicidal misery , and would frequently roll on the floor , screaming , kicking , and dishevelled , in a passion of physical and mental agony . Her professionaladvisers who , since she had little faith in orthodox practitioners of medicine , were for the most part herbalists , bone-setters , psychic healers , and osteopaths , prescribed prolonged rest-cures in sunlight as an aid to their special treatments , dietings , herbal remedies , psychic exercises , and massage . But such was the vehemence of her crises that , alarmed by her uncontrollable outburst of homicidal-looking violence , generally accompanied with a flow of the most obscene language , they had hesitated as to whether they should not call in the aid of legitimatepractitioners to have her removed to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which left their traces upon her countenance , increased the admiration of her followers , who marvelled at the supreme triumph of her spirit over material conditions which could make her a perennial source of radiations shedding peace , harmony , health , and happiness upon all who approached her . Duke George of Kronstadt , whom Julian met while calling with PrincessNevidof and Viola on their neighbor , Grand Duchess William of Baden , near the Porte Dauphine , was loud in his praises of a certain Professor Pietre . The powers of clairvoyance of this remarkable man were , he said , astounding . The professor had a large clientele among the most distinguishedmembers of the Russian court now in Paris . The Grand Duchess Peter and the Grand Duchess Nicholas had spoken of the marvellouspowers of the professor to the Tzaritsa , who had always taken a deep interest in occult phenomena . Princess Domnitsa was greatly interested in what the duke related to her concerning the wonderworker , and said that she would not fail to make his acquaintance . He possessed , the duke assured her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those who could induce him to conduct a series of his most potent means of control over supernatural forces ? secrets which , the duke whispered with awe , were no other than the terrible arcana of the Black Mas  --  ere practically assured of obtainingthe fulfilment of their most intimate desires without even having to disclose them . Princess Nevidof consulted the wonder-worker , as Julian learned one day when Baroness Rubinstein , who was passing through Paris on her way to Italy , was calling on the princess , and the latter was in turn relating to the baroness the impression which his marvellous perTHEDAYS OF IGNORANCE 237sonality had made upon her . She suggested to Baroness Rubinstein that they should , together , put to the test the higher powers of the magician , an awesome experience which she herself hesitated to face alone . But Esther Rubinstein , whose interest in the princess was , for the moment , confined to certain matters of a purely business nature , which M. Raffalovich , the Russian financial representative , had been discussing with Princess Nevidof , explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that her conscience would not permit her to take part in practices which appeared doubtfully consonantwith the injunctions of the Torah , especially as the feast of Yom Kippur , which she would be shortly celebrating in Rome , was not far distant . Julian promised Viola that he would make his long deferred visit to Rome as soon as he had disposed of his tripos examination at Cambridge , which was to take place in a few months . One afternoon , on stepping out of the diminutive lift of one of the couturiers in the Rue Castiglione , where Sylvia was having a fitting , Julian found himself face to face with the Duchess of Friedland , who had just alighted from her limousine and was waiting for the lift . It was a second or two before she recognized Julian , as he raised his hat to her . She at once greeted him , however , with her old effusiveness . " You are staying in Paris ? " she asked after the first exclamations . " Only for a few days , " Julian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ca n't very well here , " the duchess said , glancing at the lift man who was holding open for her the door of the cage , not much larger than that of a canary . " Besides , I am already three hours late for my appointment with Monsieur Joseph . Come and see me tomorrow afternoon . " " I am afraid that I have an engagement tomorrow , " said Julian . " Well , come Thursday . Yes ? There may be a few people about , as it is my afternoon at home , but we shall manage to have a few words together . You know where I live ? Avenue de Friedland . No , it 's not named after me . Bring her with you if you like , " the duchess said all in one breath . " To whom are you referring ? " Julian asked . " I do n't know . But since she is dressed by Joseph , I presume that she will be sufficiently presentable for my drawingroom . A jeudi alors , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while later in the rose court of the Ritz . With238 EUROPA some other women , whom she had met several times on the Riviera and at Saint Moritz , she was sitting sipping maraschino orangeade amid the cosmopolitan crowd . The Comtesse de Soligny de Castel-Orleans , formerly a Miss Hitchcock , of Phoenix , Arizona , had been anxious to have Sylvia 's inside information concerning the trend in underwear for the coming autumn . " The new natural line has reopened the whole thing , " said Sylvia . Some women were taking to wearing rubber webbing to reduce their hips , she told the comtesse . Baroness Rubinstein , who was staying at the Ritz , had joined the Marquise de Saint Aymour at the same table . She ignored the in- delicacy of the conversation . The King had been to Le Bourget to greet Queen Alexandra and the dowager Empress of Russia , who were on their way to the Mediterranean for a cruise . Madame de Soligny had been calling at the Crillon on Princess Ferdi- nand of Bavaria . " The poor girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the comtesse , " has n't a notion what to wear . She calls me up whenever she comes over for a run of the stores . After cavorting round all morning , she wanted me to stay for lunch , but I managed to give her the go by . She would have dragged me out for more shopping , and my legs are not built of reinforced concrete . " Baroness Rubinstein , who had scarcely addressed a word to Julian the many times they had met at Lady Penmore 's , regarding him as a youth and possibly a poor relation , had conceived a greatly enhanced estimate of his importance since meeting him at Princess Nevidof 's , and more especially on finding that he was on terms of familiar acquaintance with a person of such social consequence as Miss Chantry . The baroness was an elaborate edifice of costly draperies spangled with jewels . A loose coat of tussore bordered with green taffeta and silver trimmings , reaching below the knee , floated over the jade-colored material of her closely moulded costume , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lace . One heard , when she moved , the groans of stretched brocade and the creaking of heavy silken web . The whole court , ablaze with the women 's toilettes and large hats shaped like inverted basins garlanded with feathers , looked like an aviary of tropical birds , twittering and preening themselves among the roses of the potted bushes . There were languorous , pale South Amer- ican beauties , the wives and daughters of Argentine millionaires , freshly adorned by Worth and Patou . Two ladies with long oriental eyes were THE DAYS OF IGNORANCE 239pointed out as newly emancipated inmates of the ex-Sultan Abdul Hamid 's harem . Mrs. Cornwallis-West , who was with her son and daughter-in-law , was always being mistaken for Winston Churchill 's wife . Grand Duke Michael and Countess Torby were giving a tea-party to the Marquise de Montebello , Prince and Princess La Tour et Taxis , Mrs. Hope-Vere , and Mrs. Lee Child . Sylvia had informed Julian that the management had to allow the handsome young waiters in blue coats and striped silk waistcoats considerable freedom with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendance on so many elegant women . The Comtesse de Soligny de Castel-Orleans said : " It 's Boni de Castellanewho has sold this tavern to the suckers who imagine it 's all of Paris . Boni sure knows how . He can put most anything across these days , as long as Anna 's spondulicks hold out . Personally , I loathe it . You keep running up against bunches of Americans who put on paper caps and blow out colored bladders as if it were Hallowe'en . " Baroness Rubinstein asked Julian whether he had met Prince Nevidof . She had not the pleasure of his acquaintance , but some friends of hers in Rome , the Contessa Osio and Princess Carignan-Johnson , were anxious that she should meet him . " I do n't know whether he is the sort of person one would care to know , " she said . " Some of those Russianshave no manners . Grand Duke Vladimir , who is down shooting at Thiepval , Lazar 's place in Picardy , is a veritable bear . He is positively rude . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charm . She seemed gratified by his account . " The Russians , who now appear to be annexing France , keep very much to themselves , " said the Marquise de Saint Aymour . " They can hardly be expected to be civil to the little bourgeois officials whom they are occasionally obliged to meet . The enormous Grand Dukes , M. Isvolski and M. Raffalovich , tower silently over that absurd M. Falliere , in his badly cut clothes and buttoned boots , who looks as if he had cheated his hair-dresser . The Russians are naturally anxious to have no more to do with such persons than is absolutely necessary to take delivery of the billions needed to replenish the Russian exchequer . They do not even go to the embassy in the rue de Grenelle . Russian ambassadors are after all merely officials , which grand dukes would not dream of calling upon . Almost the only salon where one can meet them is the Duchess of Friedland 's . But then , one has to be specially favored to have an entry there . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
