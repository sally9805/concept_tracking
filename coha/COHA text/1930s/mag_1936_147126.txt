Palace officials said that Queen Mary , peeping unobserved from behind a Buckingham window curtain last week , shed tears of motherly joy as 5,000 Canadian War veterans demonstrated in extraordinary fashion their deep affection for her son Edward VIII . <P> Officially veterans had been invited only to have tea on the lawn of Buckingham Palace with the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester , following the Canadian pilgrimage to see King Edward dedicate the Vimy Ridge memorial in France ( TIME , Aug. 3 ) . Unexpectedly His Majesty arrived and was shouldering his way unannounced through the mass of Dominion veterans when they recognized him with shouts of " Oh boy , the King ! Good old Neddy ! " slapped their King-Emperor on the back , vigorously wrung his hand . <P> Taking no chances , Scotland Yard operatives of great brawn courteously and quietly pressed the veterans back , saw to it that His Majesty 's pace was accelerated until he was clear of his well-wishers . Sudden rain , after the tea was half over , sent the King scurrying to the Palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing that English folk in similar circumstances usually take shelter under trees , dashed pell-mell after him into Buckingham where one astounded Palace flunky in scarlet &; gold was heard to say to another , " It 's like the bloody Revolution !

Not all of it could be heard above the laughter and applause but deafening cheers greeted His Majesty 's remark : " We in England need this rain less than the drought-stricken portions of Canada .

If His Majesty had any such ideas the Orangemen had no use for him , and up in Belfast they promptly raised a huge portrait of Edward VIII captioned " DOWN WITH THE FENIAN KING ! " <P> Pictures showing His Majesty beating an Orangeman 's drum when Prince of Wales , were next burned at Belfast amid Irish jeers . Finally through Belfast streets rumbled a float on which an effigy of Irish Free State President Eamon de Valera dressed as a nurse attended a baby carriage in which sat an effigy of King Edward sucking a bottle of liquid labeled " DOPE .
