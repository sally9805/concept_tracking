A favorite story of Julia Kippen Jaffray 's concerns a friend who sent her rayon dress to the cleaners and got back only buttons . The dress turned to jelly . Julia Jaffray is a Canadian-born spinster of some 50 years who has made a name for herself in prison reform as secretary of the National Committee on Prisons and Prison Labor . Miss Jaffray is also much interested in women 's club work and for the past year or two she has been the spearhead of a women 's club drive which last week had the rayon industry seething with excitement . For Miss Jaffray has publicized her sex 's textile troubles so completely that the Federal Trade Commission has just issued a set of rules causing headaches to everyone in the rayon business . <P> By disintegrating in the tub , inferior materials cost laundrymen some $6,000,000 a year ; dry-cleaners some $16,000,000 . And even the best rayon must be washed and ironed differently from silks if it is not to be injured . Women 's clubs as long ago as 1920 were abuzz over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Clubs adopted a truth-in-fabrics resolution . Last year the New York City Federation of Women 's Clubs , through a committee headed by Miss Jaffray , sent a petition to Washington demanding that all goods have labels identifying their fibre content both so buyers would not be deceived and so they would know how to treat their purchases . During the FTC 's year-long study of the matter , 2,000,000 more women sent petitions seconding the idea . Meanwhile , rayon producers grew worried , presented a voluntary set of rules which they agreed to follow . Since these merely restated the status quo , the FTC promptly rejected them . Three weeks ago it formulated its own set of rules , put them into effect at once over the anguished squeals of many a rayon man . <P> By the new FTC rules , rayon producers are ordered to label their goods specifically throughout the manufacturing and distributing process . If a scarf is part silk , but mostly rayon , it must be labeled " rayon-silk . " If it is mostly silk it is to be labeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stigma that sometimes is attached to the name rayon by concocting trade and process names like Celanese , Bemberg and acetate may still use them , but must also label the goods as rayon . Sample : " Bemberg-rayon . " <P> The FTC has no immediate legal weapon to force rayon producers to obey the rules , * but the National Retail Dry Goods Association was last week urging all its members to do so . The N.R.D.G.A. regards fibre identification as one more inevitable manifestation of the consumer research and protection movement that has been spreading through the U. S. for the past decade . But many a rayon man , forced into expensive changes of his production and advertising systems , thinks differently , and various rayon groups have spent the three weeks since the original FTC decision trying hard to get it altered . Last week Erwin Feldman , counsel for the National Association of House Dress Manufacturers , tried a new tack by storming that fibre identification is due to Japanese propaganda spread by the International Silk Guild in an attempt to spike rayon sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
