txt MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES Reduction in Them Might Be Beneficial All Around . To the Editor of The New York notes ? In a radio talk Frank A. Vanderlip , chairman of a regional mortgage relief committee , intimated that under present conditions the interest being demanded on mortgages on real estate is too high . That suggestion is of tremendous importance not only to the farmers who are burdened with debt but to vast numbers of citizens residing in cities and villages who bought homes when they were employed at good salaries and naturally felt that they could meet the obligations incurred and eventually own a home . During the past three years the prices of farm products have steadily decreased . Salaries and wages have been reduced and a million or perhaps more citizens of urban communities whose homes are mortgaged are out of work , therefore the interest on their mortgages is a consideration equally as important as it is to the farmers .

A dollar now buys more of everything except mortgage interest , which is anchored at the same rate regardless of all economical considerations . In the operation of the Farm Loan Banks and the new Home Loan Banks nothing has been said or done about lowering the mortgage interest rates , Very little real bene- fit is given by merely deferring the payment of obligations . That means piling up the indebtedness which eventually must be paid , and it tends to fill the average man with despair . On the other hand , a reduction in interest on mortgages to harmonize with the prices of all commodities and earnings would put courage and hope into the hearts of millions of people . Those who hold the mortgages would get a smaller return , but their money buys more than when the loans were made and their capital would be gradually made safer . J. T. MORRIS .
