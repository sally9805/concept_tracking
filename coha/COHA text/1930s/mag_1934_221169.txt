Public utilitarians were dazed and disappointed by last fortnight 's elections . Where the issue was raised , citizens revealed a determined desire to try municipal ownership and operation of local power &; light systems . Not so many communities balloted on public ownership as last year but what worried private operators was the fact that the propositions were carried this year despite a notable decline in the chances of borrowing government funds . <P> Electric Bond &; Share , having suffered a major defeat in Knoxville last year , was again completely routed in Memphis . There TVA Director David Eli Lilienthal scored when citizens voted 18-to-1 to buy or build with the proceeds of a $9,000,000 bond issue a municipal system using TVA power . Private ownership rallied a vote only a little larger than the number of utility employes and only one-half the number of customer-stockholders . <P> Pacific Gas &; Electric was defeated in Sacramento . Calif , where citizens , after having turned down less ambitious projects for the past ten years , gave the necessary two-thirds majority to a $12,000,000 public utility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant to supply the distributing system it now owns . In St. Paul , where a power bond issue was roundly rejected last spring , voters refused to grant 20-year franchises to Northern States Power . <P> More significant than local tussles were results in three state-wide campaigns . By only a slim margin Oregon rejected a proposition backed by the Grange to put the State into the power business . In Washington voters approved ( 2-to-1 ) the Bone Power Bill which authorizes municipalities to acquire power properties outside their corporate limits . Thus Seattle 's plan of buying the $100,000,000 Puget Sound Power &; Light Co. is now legally possible . In Minnesota the citizens endorsed public-ownership by re-electing Farmer-Laborite Governor Floyd Olson ( see p. 13 ) . <P> The roster of communities rejecting public ownership heartened few utility stockholders . Muskogee , Okla. refused to approve a $1,250,000 bond issue for a local plant . Mount Olive , N. J. also thumbed down a municipal system . In Morenci , Mich. the citizens voted 435-10-393 against a power bond issue .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
