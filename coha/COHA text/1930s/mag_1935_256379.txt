Worm-Eaters <P> Sirs : <P> In your issue of May 13 , p. 30 , Professor Thorndike considers the probability of someone 's eating an earthworm in consideration of $100 cash in hand . It might interest him to hear that a man once did eat an earthworm , fresh , fat and raw , for 25 cash , then &; there paid by his farmer employer . I did not see it , but I knew both parties and my informant was the employer 's son . This throws into my mind some doubt of the value of Professor Thorndike 's statistics . <P> JOHN H. DENISON <P> Counselor at Law Denver , Colo . <P> Sirs : <P> I do not know why you published the results of Professor Thorndike 's findings regarding the sums of money for which men and women will sell out their scruples . However , I heard some of our boys discussing this article , and it developed that one of them makes a practice of eating the grubs of Japanese beetles . His technique is to nip them to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he can not describe their taste . He will eat worms for a larger consideration ! <P> The boy is 15 years of age , he is six feet in height , so that apparently he flourishes on this diet . <P> Could not these grubs be made fashionable addition to our national menu ? This section of the country would be deeply grateful for the resulting diminution of Japanese beetles . <P> GREVILLE HASLAM <P> Headmaster <P> The Episcopal Academy <P> Overbrook , Pa . <P> Sirs : <P> If Columbia 's fat and famed Thorndike asked me my price for spitting on a picture of Washington or for eating an angleworm I would n't give the silly answer the question deserved but would call for a paddy wagon . <P> It is a case of the interrogator being the " batty " one . <P> PHILIP W. SEYFARTH <P> Blue Island , Ill <P> Sirs : <P> . . . When the conversational medicine ball had been thrown back and forth enough this Sunday morning , we decided to put the question of the price for eating an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine ( incidentally a Harvard student-perhaps that explains it ) totally consumed a fairly good-sized angleworm for the small fee of 25 . We concluded that Dr. Thorndike 's price of $100 was a little high . Would he be interested ? <P> JOHN BARNARD JR . <P> South Hingham , Mass . <P> Near Brownstown , Ind . last fortnight Harold Jankowitz , 20 , CCC worker , chewed the head off a blacksnake for $1 . Said he : " I did n't really bite its head off . I mostly pulled it off . The snake was too tough . " Worker Jankowitz added the $1 to a fund with which he hopes to pay for an eye operation so he may take a West Point entrance examination. - ED . <P> Last Supper <P> Sirs : <P> As you did not reproduce the two end panels of Lord Hastings ' picture on the history of bootlegging ( on one side a rum runner unloading , on the other a liquor truck lumbering away ) so you omitted details of its christening and the name by which it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
