International Ladies ' Garment Workers Union is proud of having the biggest local ( New York 89 : 42,138 members ) of any U. S. labor union . By last week I. L. G. W. U. had something else to be proud of . While the Broadway season continued to number more flops than successes , I. L. G. W. U. 's homemade show , Pins and Needles , had become a definite hit . Produced last month by Labor Stage , Inc. as a weekend venture , the show had been so jammed since then that Labor Stage announced last week that it would present the show every night , beginning the week before Christmas . <P> It took union members a year of rehearsals , threaded between sewing hours , to get Pins and Needles in shape . Staged in a remodeled Manhattan cinema house , with an amateur cast and two grand pianos for orchestra , its rollicking satire made critics agree that I. L. G. W. U. members were class-conscious but not grim about it , that their show was funnier and faster than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end Needles declares its theme . A number of enthusiastic seamstresses change from work clothes to evening clothes , beamishly chant : <P> Sing us a song with social significance ; There 's nothing else that will do . It must be packed with social fact Or we wo n't love you . <P> Lynne Jaffee ( Dressmakers ' Union ) minces like a millionaire , twitters to a line of strikers : " It 's not cricket to picket . " The show 's dance specialty is Doin ' the Reactionary . Slim Ruth Rubinstein ( Corset &; Brassiere Union ) , as Italy 's Public Enemy No. 1 ( because she produces only one little Fascist at a time ) , laments : <P> I 'm sure that Mussolini <P> Thinks I 'm an awful meany : <P> No matter how I try <P> I can not satisfy . <P> Most popular number is one in which Mussolini , Hitler , Eden and a Japanese general , bedight with halos and wings , slyly kill each other with pistols , daggers , machine guns tucked away in their angelic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four little angels of peace are we ; <P> There is one thing on which we agree : With foe or with friend We will fight to the end <P> Just for Peace ! Peace ! Peace !
