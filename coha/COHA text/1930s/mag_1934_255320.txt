<P> Valet MacDuffy packed his bags , but President Roosevelt had plenty of things to do and people to see before leaving Washington last week for his inspection of the Tennessee Valley Authority and his annual autumn vacation in Georgia . When they were all done and seen he put on a powder-blue suit , drove to the Union Station , boarded his special train . <P> First real stop was the thriving little tobacco-market town of Harrodsburg , Ky . Forty thousand people massed to hear President Roosevelt speak from a replica of a log fort built by Daniel Boone , to hear him signalize Harrodsburg as the first permanent white settlement west of the Alleghenies . " We , too , are hewing out a commonwealth ... which we hope will give to its people ... the fulfillment of security , of freedom , of opportunity ... " the President told an audience of " pioneers of 1934 . " He waved a little silk flag and seven girls pulled the veil off a huge stone frieze of pioneer figures which cost the Federal Government $100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tenn. , ready to begin inspection of his multimillion dollar social-planning ' ' yardstick . ' ' Over a new concrete highway he rode five miles up the Clinch River valley . Soon he was standing on a bluff above the Norris damsite . More than 300 ft. below , the clang of machinery could be heard as great buckets of concrete slid across a cable line , slopped into the dam 's coffers . <P> Two years ago the President visited the spot with Senator George Norris , assured him that his Federal power dream was going to come true . Last week , with the dam a third completed , the President turned to TVA Chairman Arthur E. Morgan to exult : " It 's great stuff , is n't it ! " Dr. Morgan remarked that the lake behind the dam will have an 800-mi. shoreline . " If we start to rent cottage sites along the shoreline we 'll make a fortune , " joshed the President . Down the bluff they drove to see some workers , whom President Roosevelt addressed as future " veterans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve the conditions of millions of our American people . " <P> Next morning the Presidential party awakened in its Pullmans on the western side of Tennessee at Nashville . There was a short stop at the State Capitol grounds while Mrs. Roosevelt went up to lay a wreath on the tomb of one of her husband 's predecessors , 11th President James Knox Polk . Thousands lined streets and roads as the party continued into the country to breakfast at the old home of 7th President Andrew Jackson . <P> Up the graceful " banjo ' ' drive to " The Hermitage " swept the President 's car . He was led inside , had his attention called to the wallpaper given by Marquis de La Fayette , was seated at the head of Andrew Jackson 's dining table for just the kind of breakfast that " Old Hickory ' ' relished . First came savory country sausages and fried apples with cinnamon , followed by a superb dish of turkey hash with beaten biscuits , hominy and eggs scrambled with browned cornmeal . The President was then taken outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocked an appreciative eye at the fine old stone springhouse , pouring its sparkling waters across the world 's most abundant mint bed .
