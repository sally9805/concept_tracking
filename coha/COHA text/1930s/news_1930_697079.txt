txt A group of citizens appearing today before the House Judiciary Committee denounced prohibition as a failure , and urged a return to State control , with one witness denying that President Hoover is " the supreme arbiter of the moral duty of men . " Among the witnesses was General W. W. Atterbury , president of the Pennsylvania Railroad and Republican National Committeeman from Pennsylvania . He called for repeal of the Volstead act , and listed four conditions ascribed to prohibition which , he said , were unforeseen . General Atterbury , who appeared late in the afternoon , coming dirsOt from the railroad station to the committee room , read a statement in which he joined with nearly every other witness of the day in asking for a return of State rights , with the proviso that saloons not be re-established . As for the effect of prohibition on railroad employes , of whom there are 160,000 on the Pennsylvania system , the witness said that temperance " is a part of the employe 's very life . " " I do n't find prohibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our railroad , " he added . Urges Return to Constitution . Nicholas Murray Butler , president of Columbia University , was unable to appear before the committee , but sent a statement , entered in the record by Representative George S. Graham , chairman of the committee , in which he said : " We must get back to the Constitution of the United States by taking the Eighteenth Amendment out of it . " President Butler advocated a new system on the order of the Swedish or Quebec methods of liquor control as the first step in re-establishing the fight for temperance . Robert K. Cassatt , an investment banker and son of the first president of the Pennsylvania Railroad , told the committee that no acquaintance of his had ascribed any industrial benefits to prohibition , and advanced the opinion that " the corntry is too big to be governed by one set of laws " such as the Volstead and Jones acts . Wadsworth 's Son Appears for Him . Former Senator James W. Wadsworth , who also was unable to appear , submitted his own plea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. J. Wadsworth , who read a statement by his father which said prohibition never would succeed because it had failed to reach the conscience of the public . The younger Wadsworth , who is 24 years of age , added to his father 's summation a statement describing his observations of disregard of prohibition among his college classmates and the younger generation . Wallace Irwin , the author , in a statement mailed to the committee , termed prohibition tyranny . The Rev. Dr. John A. Ryan , Professor of Sociology of the Catholic University of America , added the word " toryism " to the descriptions of prohibition enforcement . The Rev. Dr Ryan , testifying as to the moral and legal status of prohibition legislation , recalled President Hoover 's appeal for cooperation of citizens in law enforcement and stated : " The President is not the supreme arbiter of the moral duty of men . " W. W. Montgomery Jr. , who has practiced law for thirty years in Philadelphia , said that " the result of a system which abandons regulation and substitutes an unenforceable prohibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . " Morgan A. Collins , who was Superintendent of Police during the term of Mayor Dever of Chicago , 1923-27 , said that he closed 1,500 speakeasies without any appreciable change in the liquor situation there , charged that graft and bribes had nullified justice to a great extent and that beer runners are a law unto themselves . Even where corruption did not exist , the witness added , there was a pronounced disinclination on the part of courts , district attorneys and juries to prosecute prohibition cases . He flatly refused , however , to name persons or state specific instances in his charges . Another witness from Chicago , Dr. Francis J. Gerty , head of the County Psychopathic Hospital of Cook County , which embraces Chicago , testified to an increase in alcoholism since prohibition became a ? law . Two attorneys for Washington , Wilton Lambert and Rice Hooe , testified that conditions are steadily getting worse in the national capital , Mr. Lambert saying specifically that they are " vastly worse than before prohibition .

Joy before the committee . Atterbury Recalls Road 's Rules . General Atterbury told the committee that his purpose in appearing was solely because of his interest " in the preservation of law and order . " " That preservation will always arise primarily from universal respect of the people for law , " the railroad executive continued . " Anything that tends to disturb public respect for law constitutes a serious menace to the preservation of public order . " I am opposed to the saloon , and I regard the wiping out of the saloon as a great boon to the country . I am in favor of temperance . I am at the head of a railroad , the efficiency and the safety of the operation of which absolutely require temperance on the part of the employes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Pennsylvania Railroad . I remember very valll that when I started my service for our company there was in the book of rules Rule G , which read : " ' The use of intoxicants by employes while on duty is prohibited . Their habitual use , or the frequenting of places where they are sold , is sufficient cause for dismissal . ' " Later this rule was amended to read as follows : " ' The use of intoxicants by employes while on duty is prohibited . Their use , or the frequenting of places where they are sold , is sufficient cause for dismissal . ' " You will note that in revising the rule the word ' habitual ' was left out , and it was distinctly set forth that the use of intoxicants by employes was sufficient cause for dismissal . " I should like to say that railroad employes have been at all times , and are today , the most temperate body in any industry . Says Workers Are Temperate .

" Now we were merely mistaken in our judgment of public sentiment when we placed a ban on the moderate use of liquor . At the same time we were correct in our interpretation of that sentiment with reference to the liquor traffic . " Why should we not frankly and honestly recognize these facts ? Why should we not ask our present opponents to join with us in an effort to work out a plan by which we can accomplish the best purpose we have in common ? If we will only do this , we will soon rid our country of the terrible scourge which is now afflicting it . We created that scourge apd upon our heads rests the responsibility for its continued existence . What are we going to do ? " " In appearing today , " General Atterbury said , " I come not as a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but simply in my individual capacity as a citizen to bring about a solution of the serious problem confronting us that will be in the best interests of our country and our citizens . " My only interest is in seeing adopted a method of handling the If we but give the people of the prohibition question which will conduce to the of law and States a chance , they can be trusted preservation order and not to conditions which to work this thing out in the interest undermine the moral fibre of all of temperance and decency . " The younger Wadsworth said his classes of our citizenship and which tend to break down the most sacred father was " too courageous a man to of our institutions . resort to expediency , and all knew his attitude , even though New York City Would Repeal Volstead Law . was plastered with posters calling him a " You may ask , ' What , under the . , He ' fake wet .

" Saying that no amount of force or law or " suspending the bill of rights " would have effect in " the failure of the prohibition law to reach the conscience of the average man , " the former Senator added , " nor can a whole people be indicted . " " The Federal Union of States , the Constitution itself , are being undermined , " he continued . " We must retrace our steps and correct the fearful error of the Eighteenth Amendment , for that amendment is the root of all our troubles . As long as it stands we shall suffer . It must be repealed or changed substantially to the end that the people of the States may resume the exercise of that power which was theirs for 130 years and which was so unexpectedly taken from them during the recent war .

The enormous development of the bootleg industry , the profits from which have been so large as to bring about an alliance in many cases between those charged with law enforcement and the most recklessly criminal section of the population . " 3 . The enormous temptations to official corruption and the great development of this corruption . " 4 . The revolt of the youth of the country against being deprived of personal liberties which their parents had enjoyed , resulting in a situation which has caused a large number of the most conservative college authorities to urge the repeal of the amendment . " As a result of the unforeseen and admitted by-products of prohibition , this country is faced with a problem which can not be evaded . The real question before us , as I see it , is how most effectively to minimize the abuse of alcoholic beverages and restore that respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proponents of the Eighteenth Amendment certainly had that purpose in mind when they assured its passage , but many who were inclined to agree with them then have now come to the conclusion that prohibition is not the best method of accomplishing the result . It has been fairly tried out for a reasonable length of time , and has produced unexpected evils of more serious consequence than any of us imagined could have arisen . " Presents a Dry 's Conclusion . General Atterbury presented an article from Scribner 's Magazine for February , written- by Francis M. Cockrell , son of the Senator from Missouri , who , the witness said , " was and still is a prohibitionist at heart . " The article , pointing out that prohibitionists and opponents were united against the return of the saloon , asks : " What shall we do about it ? Shall we who are responsible for prohibition blindly continue in our effort to carry out our full program by legal force  --  and continue to get no effecfor Repeal . Dr. Butler , who wrote that his statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hurried trip abroad , wrote in part : " There is no difficulty in dealing with the social problems which arise from liquor and the liquor traffic , if one really wishes to deal with them intelligently . The Scandinavian people and the Province of Quebec have shown how this can be done to the aid and promotion of the cause of temperance , and the true protection of civil and political liberty . " We must get back to the Constitution of the United States , first , by taking the so-called Eighteenth Amendment out of it , and then we can deal with the big problem as we were helpfully and hopefully dealing with it when this blow struck ten years ago . " With the Eighteenth Amendment repealed , the State laws regarding the liquor traffic , as these existed in 1920 , would again come into force . The statutes controlling interstate commerce in alcoholic liquor would again become operative . In the State of New York we should have ready for action by our Legislature a carefully drawn act adapting to our State 's condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which prevails so effectually in our neighbor , the Province of Quebec . " Wadsworth Sees Public Change . Noting that the public appears to have been " becoming less good-natured and more resentful of the extreme measures of the government , " former Senator Wadsworth , through his son , said the resistance to prohibition is divided between two large groups which comprise a majority of the population . " First , " he said , " we have the people who can not be brought to believe that the taking of an occasional drink is a wicked or dangerous act and who , carrying out their desires , purchase it without the slightest compunction . It is this group that makes the market served by the bootlegger . Without the purchasers ( and they may be numbered by the million and found in every walk of life ) the bootlegger would soon go out of business . In making their purchases , or in taking a drink of illegal liquor , they are resisting the government . " Then we have those people who , although non-drinkers , think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally . Their viewpoint is such that they refuse to inform the authorities of the violations of the law which they see going on before their very eyes . They can not be persuaded that their friends and neighbors are doing anything deserving exposure and punishment . " These two groups comprise an overwhelming majority of the people . Indeed , it may be said that they are the people of the United States  --  almost the whole people , for there are very , very few outside these categories . In effect , they are resisting the law and the government . The latter fights its battles almost single-handed , and as it resorts to desperate measures it encounters more and more determined resistance . Such has been the history of every attempt by government to . control unreasonably the personal conduct of the individual . Holds Resistance Nation-Wide . " In one respect the country is fortunate in that the resistance is not confined to a geographical section or a few populous States , otherwise we would be on the verge of civil war . As it is , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued . " His stand was taken on personal liberty . He was deserted by enough followers to put an equally wet man in office . " The witness , who is a member of the Crusaders , the young men 's antiprohibition movement , said : " I assert , not claim , that drinking has increased , " and added that by the time he entered Yale student drinking was " so matter-of-fact as to be not discussed . " " We are not trying to force the drys to drink , " he continued . " We do want the bootlegger ousted with all his filthy parasites , but we want the God-given right to lead our own lives in our own way as guaranteed by the original Constitution . " The placing of liquor sales under proper regulation , but without the flat prohibition which invites rebellion against restraint , would materially aid in solving the problem of drinking by young people , the witness believed . Representative Tucker asked if it were true that parents sometimes gave liquor to their children to take to parties to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The witness said it was , agreeing with Representative Fiorello La Guardia , who interjected : " The fact is , even girls now carry flasks , whether filled by their mothers or somebody else ! ! Irwin Calls Law Tyranny . Mr. Irwin , a member of the authors ' and artists ' ' committee of the Association Against the Eighteenth Amendment , declared that " submission to tyranny is as immoral as tyranny itself . " " But for revolt against unjust alien authority , " he asserted , " there would have been no United States of America . Unless there is strength to bring an honest revolt against the tyranny of a fanatic minority , the United States can not endure as the free country of a free people . " I have seen no benefit brought to my country by the passage or enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment . The ills which have followed in its train are familiar to all  --  excessive drinking of inferior liquor , murder , arson , debauchery , dishonesty of every kind , and the rise to power of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been power save for the existence of a law behind which there was not the heart and the will of the whole people . " That this iniquitous amendment be nullified is my earnest prayer . Otherwise , I believe civil war and ultimate ruin will come to the country in which I was born , in which I enjoyed a happy and prosperous youth and from which I had hoped that these same blessings in even greater degree might be allotted my sons . " The Rev. Dr. Ryan Says Law Sears . The Rev. Dr. Ryan freely expressed his views on public characters and official practices . " Prohibition sears everything it touches and confuses the mental processes of higher officials . " George W. Wickersham , Dean Roscoe Pound and Newton D. Baker , he said , are " ordinarily men of clear vision , " and Attorney General Mitchell , who recently ruled that those who enforced prohibition must be dry , was " generally regarded as rea , sonable and reasonably clearsighted . " " Speaking of moral law , " he continued , " President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of his business . He is no more a moral authority than I am . Let him not lay down dogmatically the law that good citizens should tell others what they should do . " Under a cross-fire of questioning the Rev. Dr. Ryan said it was an " unreasonable expectation " to ask all citizens to encourage positively the enforcement of all the laws . Adding that to refuse to encourage a law could not be construed as necessarily morally wrong in cases of great national issues , he recalled the fugitive slave laws and the Boston Tea Party . He criticized those who ask for continuance of prohibition on the grounds of industrial benefit , as well as politically dry and personally wet legislators . He asserted that prosperity at the cost of personal liberty was a debatable gain . " The spirit of prohibition legislation is essentially the spirit of Toryism , " the witness said . " When the people of the United States decide they no longer want prohibition they will find a way to end it despite Tories , autocrats , industrialists and fanatics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right to Protest . Referring to protests by a citizen against prohibition , Father Ryan said : " So far as a law meets with his conscience and judgment that it invades personal liberty , what remedy has he except to petition in public and in principle his desire to get it repealed ? And he can not be charged with disloyalty to his government if he tries to have an obnoxious law repealed . " The witness said further that " the assumption that ' the best way to get rid of a bad law is to enforce it thoroughly , ' is false . The laws that people rid themselves of by disobeying them number far more than those which have been repealed . No more improper implication ever ' was made . " Representative Graham referred to the Boston Tea Party , agreeing with the Rev. Dr. Ryan 's contention that there is a moral right to discuss objectionable laws for the purpose of repeal , and added : " If great enough consequences are involved , the questions may even go to revolution . " Representative Michener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get rid of prohibition . Mr. Graham denied this interpretation of his remark . The Rev. Dr. Ryan said that he would not go so far as to advocate revolution . Representative Stobbs recalled that it was once illegal to play golf on Sunday and asked Dr. Ryan if that was the sort of a law against which he would peacefully rebel . " Precisely , " was the reply . The educator particularly denounced the arguments to the effect that the welfare of the nation 's workers has been measurably aided by prohibition , not concerning himself with the truth of these arguments but with what he termed the " industrial feudalism and industrial serfdom " underlying any principle which would remove a worker 's liberty in order to increase his efficiency . " One of the most deplorable effects of prohibition is widespread ins sincerity . " Dr. Ryan contended that large groups of the people drink when they get the opportunity with no scruples against violation of the prohibition law , yet support the law with their votes in the feeling that they are not committing an unvirtuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious obstacle in the way of return to sanity . " Collings Tells of Chicago . Mr. Collins , who resigned with a change of administration , declared he was the only " dry " police chief Chicago ever had . His whole force was charged with prohibition enforcement , but a special squad of twelve members closed the speak- , easies . " Was any liquor sold after that , " Representative La Guardia asked . " Plenty of it , " he replied . " Chicago is a peculiar place . You ca n't get anywhere in the courts . The Federal forces could n't remedy the evils unless they had the courts with them . " Reviewing Mr. Collins ' testimony , including statements of bribes and other illegal ' acts , Representative Michener stated : " You have made some serious charges here . You pictured a man offering you $2,000 . You tell of a court bailiff who can be fixed and who signals to the judge in certain cases . Do n't you think it fair to give the names . " " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have you any personal knowledge ? " asked Representative Stobbs . " I have some , but I wo n't give anybody 's mime , " the witness stated . The testimony of Dr. Gerty consisted almost entirely of statistics , being summed up by him as follows : " Of every age group in both sexes , the figures show that there was a decrease in alcoholic cases and deaths in Cook County down to July , 1919 , ' a low period for the following year , and from then on , in every set of statistics I have studied , there has been an increase . " One general illustration of his tables was the one for the Cook County Hospital , which showed that in the years 1916-1919 an average of 153 cases of alcoholism were treated annually , with eighteen fatalities . From 1920 to 1928 the average was 934 cases treated annually , with thirty-two deaths . The testimony of the anti-prohibitionists may be completed tomorrow , the chief witness scheduled to appear being Pierre S. du Pont . The drys then would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only on Wednesday and Thursday each week . CUSTOMS MEN CONVICTED . Duluth Ex-Collector and Two Aides Tried for Drugs Bribery Plot . DULUTH , ? Minn. , Feb. 26 UM. ? Oscar E. Dahly , former customs collector for Duluth ; Thomas F. Hoban , former customs patrolman , and Ernest W. Beaton , customs agent , tonight were found guilty of conspiracy by a Federal court jury after more than ten hours deliberation . The fourth defendant , E. A. Peters , a Duluth druggist , was acquitted . Charges against the four men grew out of an alleged conspiracy to fix with officials at Washington a charge of selling narcotics brought against Edward A. Smith , Duluth Druggist , in December , 1928 . Smith , the government 's chief witness , testified that he paid Hoban $1,000 for expenses of a trip to Washington and later $3,500 after being referred to Hoban by Dahly and Beaton . Peters was brought into the case in connection with negotiations alleged to have been opened for the purchase of Smith 's drugstore when the latter announced that he desired to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this trouble . " Smith testified that Hoban demanded $11,000 in all . Sentence of the three convicted men was postponed by Judge William A. Cant , because of the late hour . Conviction provides for a sentence of two years ' imprisonment and a fine of $10,000 or both . SLAIN IN LIQUOR CHASE . Virginia Man Was Shot by Two Policemen , Now Held for Murder . Special to The New York Times . SALISBURY , Md. , Feb. 26 . ? Clayton Townsend , who was suspected as a bootlegger , is dead from a bullet wound , and two Chincoteague ( Va. ) town policemen , Sergeant C. D. Andrews and his deputy , Elsie Justice , are charged with murder , after an extended chase over Chincoteague Island last night . Townsend , accompanied by Charles Niblett and Eva Marshall . was driving a car when Andrews and Justice commanded him to halt , and , according to their story , he sped away . Justice pursued and jumped upon the running-board , but said he was knocked off the car by Townsend . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three shots at it . The car stopped with Townsend dying .

Eighteenth Amendment prohibits the manufacture , sale , transportation , &c.,; of intoxicating liquors. but does not define what is intoxicating . The Volstead act attempts to do so , and the Supreme Court has decided that Congress has the right to interpret it . " Has Congress the right to delegate that authority ? In other constitutional requirements it has delegated its authority , and there seems to be no reason why it should not do so in this case . " If I am correct , the Volstead act should be repealed and the authority should be delegated to the States to determitit. , each for itself , what is intoxicating , and then enact appropriate legislation to enforce it . This would bring the question right back to each individual State , where it properly belongs , and would restore the situation as it existed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly going dry and public opinion supported such action . " In Pennsylvania , as you know , with the Brooks high license law , with local option and with the courts refusing renewal of license to any saloon against which there was complaint and refusing a license to any new applicant if there was a local objection , we had reached the point where in the rural and suburban districts it was absolutely dry and the sale of liquor was practically confined to the large cities ; indeed , the number of saloons was rapidly being reduced  --  all with the support of public opinion . " I think the real question of temperance has lost ground in the last ten years , but I believe that , with the return of the question to the States , with the experiences we have had during these ten years , with full recognition of the benefits that have accrued from the ? elimination of the saloon and with proper regulation of the manufacture and sale , under government control and supervision , State and national , somewhat on the qwq that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers and employes imperative .

" When the prohibition amendment was adopted it was expected by its proponents that it could be enforced . Had the law been supported by the great body of public opinion its enforcement might have been possible . Even prior to the passage of the amendment , certain States were able to secure a high degree of prohibition because in those States the law was supported by a great majority of the people .
