Corruption <P> One of the wonders of the East is Connecticut 's $25,000,000 Merritt Parkway , 32 miles ( two lanes each way ) of satinsmooth express motor roads winding through manicured countryside back of coastal towns from Stratford ( near Bridgeport ) to the New York line . Another wonder of the East , but for the omission of a compulsory clause in a recent Connecticut law , would have been the water closets in all Connecticut public buildings . That such wonders should have had graft attached to them was last week cause for grief and headlines in the thrifty State of Connecticut . <P> The Merritt Parkway scandal involved a real-estate man , G. LeRoy Kemp , who as the State 's agent bought much of the land needed for right-of-way and who allegedly shared in some $86,000 of rakeoff commissions with two real-estate agents , Thomas N. Cooke of Greenwich and Samuel H. Silberman of Stamford . On the witness stand Mr. Cooke testified that Land Agent Kemp used to tip him off as to acreage the State wanted , that Cooke then arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Silberman testified to giving Kemp another $27,865 . Mr. Kemp admitted receiving as much as $21,942 from the two men but said it was a gift . Found guilty last week , he was sentenced to three-to-seven years in jail , appealed . <P> The water-closet scandal was just one splash in a whirlpool of trouble which recently engulfed husky , ruddy Democrat T. Frank Hayes , who eight years ago became the biggest political frog in Waterbury . Mayor of Waterbury , he also became Lieutenant Governor of Connecticut and , though honest old Governor Wilbur Lucius ( " Uncle Toby " ) Cross , onetime dean of Yale 's Graduate School , was too spry ever to let him get his hand on the highest State controls , he presided over the Senate in a style which , his accusers said , was lucrative as well as lordly . <P> When some people came along with a high-powered new water closet , * Lieutenant Governor Hayes took an interest in the company and presided over sessions at which a bill calling for such equipment in all public places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fixture which , when a user rises , snaps its seat back into a recess , scours it with live steam and a scrubbing brush , cools it with a jet of water , snaps it out again for the next patron . <P> Several legislators who allegedly accepted stock in the water-closet company in return for pushing through a health bill for it were arrested with Lieutenant Governor Hayes on this and other counts . Last month when the trials began Mr. Hayes and 22 others pleaded not guilty . Two other defendants pleaded guilty , one of them Harry Mackenzie , + longtime first lieutenant of Connecticut 's late Republican dictator , hard-bitten John Henry Roraback.
