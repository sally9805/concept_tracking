txt Mark Sullivan recently called attention to the fact that a recrudescence of banking " runs " significantly synchronized with publication of the list of loans made by the Reconstruction Finance Corp . to banking institutions , and suggested that the coincidence was more than accidental . To anyone having at least a preliminary acquaintance with the psychology of banking , the suggestion is prima facie persuasive . It illustrates the strange perversity of view entertained by many people with respect to the banker , his responsibilities and his duties . This view is apparently predicated upon a totally false assumption , for which no possible excuse can be made , the assumption , namely , that it is the commercial banker 's money that is in question , as distinguished from the people 's money . This assumption is at the base of most of the discussion by our legislators on banking matters , and it permeates even the thought and talk of many other classes in the community . including a great many people who ought to know better . Congressman Steagall 's Logic Congressman Steagall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the list of loans should be published , said that the Reconstruction Finance Corp . funds belonged to all the people and they were entitled to know what was being done with them . And in answer to Mr. Broderick 's ( New York Superintendent of Banking/ protest to Speaker Garner and Congressman La Guardia that publicity of the lists was " extremely dangerous " at this time , the Congressman thought that all that was necessary was to assure depositors that such loans " were beneficial to them . " Congressman Steagall 's logic would justify the man who in a theatre would insist upon Informing the rest of the audience that a corner of the scenery had caught fire , on the ground that it had the " right to know . " regardless of the consequences . Superintendent Broderick knew that some people , perhaps many , would wrongly regard such bank borrowings as a sign a distress despite assurances . and all informed people know that the Superintendent 's view is right . Admit , if you please , all the errors of judgment , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have ever been even alleged against the commercial banker , the fact remains that the foundation stone of commercial banking is the relation that exists between the banker and the depositor . The depositor is a private individual who entrusts his own money for safe keeping to his banker . giving him full powers as to its disposition . The banker is the sole judge as to that disposition . No one , not even the community as a whole , has any rights of disposition with respect to bank deposits other than or beyond such rights as he or the community might have over the depositor 's money kept in a tin box in his home . There is no difference whatever from this point of view between the two forms of money How Then , to Treat One 's Money ? But . we are told , this makes the commercial banker an absolute arbiter of credit , a tremendous power to place in anyone 's hands . Quite true . But %%hat inherent right is there in anyone to bori ow someone else 's monej , regardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of his banker his own will because he wants the banker 's judgment and the banker 's will , informed by that judgment , to take the place of his own judgment and will . What right , therefore , has even the community to take , save by taxation , the money thus administered by the banker ? We are told that credit must be nationalized ; this means in substance that the individual 's money is to be placed -- not by taxation ? at the disposal of the community . How can this be made compulsory upon him ? And . if not compelled . who is likely Fo to neat his mon ? V ? Credit is personal and when it ceases to he personal it is not credit . That is the essence of all banking . Credit Is only confidence under another name , and confidence Is the most sensitive plant known , and of the slowest grdwth . In publishing the list of bank borrowings from the Reconstruction Finance Corp . the Congress no doubt thought it was hitting the banker ? if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom the blow falls if it falls anywhere . Whether we like It or not . the power of the banker to extend credit is essential to banking , and if we abolish It we abolish banking . From that conclusion there IS no escape , and we had better look It squarely in the face .
