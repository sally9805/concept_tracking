A favorite Wall Street notion is that traders in odd lots ( less than 100 shares of stock ) are always wrong-when they buy , the market goes down ; when they sell , it goes up . Last week the first comprehensive survey of odd-lot trading-made by the Brookings Institution under the direction of Dr. Charles 0 . Hardy-found that odd-lotters are generally smart enough to buy on declines and sell on advances , but not smart enough to wait for a marked decline or a substantial advance . By buying and selling too soon , they miss the boat on long-term price trends . Other findings : &gt; Since 1920 the average odd-lot trader has bought 106 shares , sold 100 , thus accumulated six shares . <P> &gt; Since 1920 the average odd-lotter on monthly balances has sold his stocks about 14% under the price he paid for them . <P> &gt; In 1929 the big three dealers* who do 97% of the New York Stock Exchange odd-lot business bought 140,000,000 odd-lot shares , sold 156,000,000 . In 1938 they bought 49,000,000 , sold 50,000,000-16.1% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mellick &; Co. , DeCoppet &; Doremus and Jacquelin &; DeCoppet , all doing about the same amount of business .
