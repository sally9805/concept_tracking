The surrealistic sight of a Parisian racing through his native streets with his head thrust through a cane chair-seat , a pair of garters streaming from his back and a license plate and a pot of vegetables in either hand , is not a sign of galloping national debility due to continental complications . Frenchmen know , and others soon learn , that the galloper is merely out to win the 200-franc ( $5.30 ) prize , offered each afternoon by the private radio station Paste Parisien in its Course au Trsor , a radio scavenger hunt patterned after one which Paris loved in the droll U. S. cinema My Man Godfrey . <P> Master of these hunts , which last week wound up a riotous year of keeping Paris in daily stitches , has been self-styled Le Roi des Loufoques ( King of the Nuts ) , Pierre Dae , a baldish , crinkly-eyed comic . <P> Dac 's real name is Andr Isaac . He is a singer , an actor sometimes at the Deux Anes ( Two Asses ) theatre , author and editor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 13 h. 5 ( 1:05 p. m. ) for the last year he has sent Parisians by the hundreds rummaging high &; low for varying collections of oddments , to be produced within two hours at a designated rendezvous . An open street is usually necessary for the arriving candidates and their equipages . This was evident from the start , when the first after noon hundreds of participants piled into the old Paste Parisien building with brooms , stray cats and dogs etc. , put the wheezy , three-place elevator out of commission , utterly disrupted business . <P> Course au Trsor , an attempt to beguile the French with U. S. humor as the movies and radio report it , was a big success from the start , even eliciting a letter from a Ceylon fan asking for a handicap . The 200-franc prize goes to the first arrival with the required objects , usually ten . <P> One sample day the call went out for a scuttle of coke , a picture of soldiers , a bi cycle saddle attached to the back , twelve marbles on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five francs in 50-centime pieces , a piece of cloth tied around the leg , a mineral-water bottle label , one hand drawn on a piece of white paper and the ability to conjugate on arrival , while standing , the imperfect subjunctive of the verb s'asseoir ( to sit down ) . * It is interesting and profitable work for housewives , youths and the unemployed , who have the after noon to themselves . <P> For this year Dae , the livest radio character in France , is starting a variation of the treasure-hunt idea , in which he drops token coins in hiding places around Paris , directs listeners to them somewhat as Uncle Don tells U. S. youngsters where the family has hidden their birthday presents . <P> *The conjugation : je m'assisse , tu t'assisses , il s'asst , nous nous assissions , vous vous assis-siez , ils s'assissent.
