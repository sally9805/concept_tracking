Those who decorate an altar with flowers are particularly privileged , and in a special sense cooperators with Him . For the flowers are His own ; and all who come into His House feel so . The altar vases thus represent no casual " decoration . " They are a constant work of art , expressing the consecrated thought of the artist creating perpetual beauty in the worship of God . <P> Thus last week in The Churchman ( Episcopal ) wrote Rev. Dr. Donald Bradshaw Aldrich of Manhattan 's Church of the Ascension . His remarks were by way of foreword to an article " Flowers on the Altar " by Mrs. Eleanor H. Sloan , Connecticut horticulturist who long has been on the Church of the Ascension 's Altar Guild . Helpful to harassed ladies on altar guilds up &; down the land were Mrs. Sloan 's practical pointers . Excerpts : <P> " The altar flowers on a given Sunday can express the season-white for All Saints ' Day , red for Whitsunday-or they may be a memorial . . . . For instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ascension were given in memory of a warrior son lost on the field of battle . Glorious spears of gladiolus were selected in a vivid , singing red-a most triumphant note all through the worship , that day . <P> " One November Sunday no one gave flowers . Here was a problem . . . . It was met by bringing an armful of white pine branches from the country . In each vase of soft feathery green were inserted a few branches of brilliant autumn leaves . The effect was ' different , ' and caused much favorable comment . The symbolism was rather nice , too . . . . <P> " It is wise to connect with one good florist and do business all through him . He then gets to know the vases and how to make up his piece so that it fits . . . . Be sure to choose a florist who has fresh , first class merchandise . ' Seconds ' are noticeably inferior when placed on the altar , and they wilt rapidly . " <P> Mrs. Sloan comes out " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , texture and scale are all bad . " White roses , says she , " are never wholly successful . Even the best fade very rapidly , almost before they open . " The button chrysanthemum she finds one of the few small flowers which look well on the Lord 's table . " Once we used button chrysanthemums in yellow and deep bronze with dark red oak leaves at the base . Very Spanish , when seen at close range ; but the colors were massed in such a way that from a distance they looked like two lovely flames . " <P> For country churches Mrs. Sloan approves garden flowers and even such wild growths as " soft brown cattails ( shellacked to preserve their deep color ) , grasses and such delights as the brown cottony seed pods of the fireweed , the cloudy blue bayberry , or the brilliant scarlet berries of the black alder . . . . " <P> But , cautions Mrs. Sloan , garden blooms " must not be insignificant nor as someone expressed it , diddley. "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
