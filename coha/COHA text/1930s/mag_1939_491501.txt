SPEECH by the President at Shadow Lawn on Saturday closed his 1916 campaign for re election . When I awoke Sunday morning , I tried to picture to myself how , in this brief time since we were married  --  less than eleven months  --  my whole life had changed . Four years before , I had been blithefully touring abroad , catching , with in  --  different ears , only the faintest echo of the partisan struggle at home . I had never voted . and never expected to . I had never met a President , or ex  --  pected to . The election would be Tuesday . I had never felt that we could win the majority of the electoral votes , for while the masses seemed for my husband , there was so much money in the hands of the Republicans . In addition , the Mexican policy was still being at  --  tacked , and the war in Europe was bringing new and greater problems every hour . All this was summed up as I lay there that Sunday before any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would do when we should leave the White House , which I calculated would be in just four more mouths . It had been a wild night . A sudden downpour of rain , fol  --  lowed by such high winds , had made it impossible to sleep . While going over these ques  --  tions in my thoughts , the door gently opened and I saw my husband standing there , already dressed . Seeing me awake , he came in and said : " I was hoping you were awake , because I want to make the speech to you which I intended making yes  --  terday , but someway could not got it out . It was this . " He then brought out . clear as crystal , his program for the fu  --  ture . Alas , that I can not repeat it , for it was destined to be put aside on account of the war , and so forever lost . When he finished , I told him that . I had been mapping out what we would do after he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up and , looking down at me , said : " What a delightful pessimist you are . One must never court defeat . If it comes , accept it like a soldier . but do n't anticipate it , for that destroys your fighting spirit . " On Monday , November 6 , 1916 , I find recorded in my Line-a-day Book : At . 2:30 a delegation headed by Mr. Paderewski arrived to ask W. to set aside a day to help the Poles . I knelt in the hall above and heard all they said . Mr. P. ending with a beautiful tribute to my husband and expressing his utmost faith in him and his sincere desire to help these suffering people . I shall never forget Mr. Paderewski 's face as he stood pleading the cause of his country . It was so fine , so tragic , so earnest . His hair was like a nimbus around his head . To have seen together these two men who were making the world better and happier is a memory I shall always cherish . The Election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day , dawned radi ? an tly clear , and we had a very early breakfast to  --  gethEr and drove to Princeton to vote . By a strange trick of fate , this was the only time in my life I have voted in person for a presidential candidate . In 1920 we voted by mail and , following that , after Mr. Wil  --  son 's death , I lost my right to vote , being a resident of the District of Columbia . Late in the afternoon , Frank Sayre arrived . He and Doctor Grayson were the only guests at dinner , after which we all gathered in the upstairs sitting room to await the news of the election . The telegraph company had offered to run in a special wire , so we could get the returns , but my husband said he did not care for it , and we would get the news by tele  --  phone from the Executive Offices . We decided to play a game of Twenty Questions , but before we began Doctor Grayson said he thought he would run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Executive Offices , and would tele  --  phone us . An hour had passed without news , when , about ten o'clock , Margaret jumped up , saying : " Oh , there 's the phone . " A tactless friend in New York was calling to condole with her over " your father 's defeat . " Margaret was breathless with sur  --  prise and resentment. , and spluttered out at him : " Why , he is not defeated . What are you talking about. ? " This reply was amazing , for he had said : " The flashlight from the New York Times Build  --  ing  --  white for Wilson , red for Hughes  --  has already flashed req. , conceding the election to the Republi  --  cans . " But Margaret stood her ground and valiantly declined to accept this as final . " Impossible , " she said . " They can not know yet . In the West they are still at the polls . " As soon as the friend rang off , we called the Execu  --  tive Offices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond speech in his impenetrable gloom . A little later Doctor Grayson returned , - explaining that he had not phoned because the news was all against us . How did I feel ? Well , not so hopeful or so indig  --  nant. as Margaret , and not so encompassed by gloom as Tumulty . All along I had felt in my bones that the opposition was too rich and too strong for us . Hard and bitter as it was to see my husband torn from his work toward the great and liberal objectives he held for his country , and which he had so feel  --  ingly outlined to me at dawn on . Sunday morning , I had long been secretly preparing an armor against the sting of defeat . This armor met the test . I found real consolation in the thought that , at last , we should be alone together . My husband bad agreed with Margaret that it was too early to be assured of anything ; adding , however , that Republican claims of victory and Democratic concessions of defeat seemed soundly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later my hus  --  band told me what followed . He waited for them to open the subject of their visit . When nothing developed after an hour 's talk , he finally said : " Well , it is delightful to see you fel  --  lows , but what was it you especially wanted to see me about today ? " Whereupon they looked at each other , both visibly embarrassed . At last Dean Fine said : " I am sorry to say the real object of our visit can not he accomplished , for we thought , when we wrote , we would come over and congratulate you on your re-election , " Then the whole mournful story came out . They had arrived at the gate only five minutes late , and had sat there before coming in , trying to think of some reason for their visit that would sound plausible , for they hated to tell Um the truth . My husband said they were so tragic , and so embarrassed , that he laughed heartily and told them they were taking it much harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next day was our last at Shadow Lawn . I find this entry in my diary : THURBDAT , NovEmm:HO : Got up about 5 ; found no one knew a thing more than the night . before . Margaret had to go to New York , and we spent the morning receiving tel .. egrams and winding up things at Shadow Lawn . Played golf at Spring Lake , and when we were on the eighth tee , Doctor Grayson arrived with news from headquarters that they thought Cali  --  fornia was sate , and if so , that meant Democratic victory . The doctor and Altrude were leaving at 4:30 , and he was so ex  --  cited and nervous she said he could neither eat nor sleep . Victory At 8:30 that night we left. , still without more definite news , motoring to Sandy Hook , where dear Captain Berry was waiting for us with the launch . He was keyed to concert pitch over the election . On the Mayflower everything was filled with flowers . We sat on deck until 9:30 P.M. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of us walked around the deck . Pres  --  ently the marvelous lights of New York came into view . In the harbor we stopped to put off our old Chinaman , the cook , who was very ill . It seemed pitiful when the poor , thin old body was tenderly low  --  ered on a stretcher , and then his box of possessions after him . I suppose the suspense and strain were making my nerves queer , for I felt so weepy over the old Chinaman that I do n't know what would have happened had not an orderly come at that moment with a handful of wire  --  less messages . We went into the smok  --  ing room under the light to read them . They all told of new gains in the West , but the issue was still uncertain . The following is from my journal : Nov. 10 , 1916 : Up at 7:30 . Brooks brought wireless that seemed to make victory certain . All through these days Mr. Wilson has been calm and undis  --  turbed , but I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubly glad when it is settled . Wo had a happy little breakfast by our  --  selves in the main cabin ; then I rushed below to tell the girls Margaret and Helen the last news . There were great crowds both at the boat and the train , and one lady rushed forward and presented me with a cluster of violets , saying : ' ' These with all the happiest wishes for our next . Pres  --  ident and his wife . " This was really the first time I had felt certain that the people had stood by my husband . Back at the White House , Colonel House gave us a ludicrous account of Mr. Henry Morgenthates big dinner on the night of the election . It was planned as a. " victory dinner , " but the guests began to call for liquids to assist them to swallow the bitter news that the Republicans had won . He said Vance McCormick literally aged be  --  fore their eyes , but that he never gave up his fight and cheered them all with his optimism . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long talk about affairs in Europe be  --  tween Woodrow and Colonel House ; latter does not think things as serious as W. does . Mr. Wilson wrote his war message to Congress as he evolved nearly all his state papers , by first making a draft in shorthand , then typing a fair copy on his own typewriter . The message was finished on Sunday , April first , after we had returned from services at Mr. Wilson 's church . The President had asked Frank I. Cobb , editor of the New York World , to come down . He simply wanted a friend to talk to . Due to a delay in receiving the invi  --  tation , Mr. Cobb did not arrive until one in the morning . The President was waiting up . They talked for an hour or so . My diary states : Arum 2. 1917 : Momentous day . Con  --  congress convened at I2 noon ; called in special session to declare war . The 11 ou so did not organize in time for the message to be de  --  livered until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside was almost as dense as Inauguration Day . Troops were standing guard ' round the building , which stood out while and majestic in the indirect lighting , which was used for the first time this eventful night . When I reached the gallery , after leaving my husband in the room always reserved for him , I found every seat taken and people standing in every available place , both on the dour and in the galleries . My mother and Margaret and I sat in the first row , and I could hear people breath  --  ing. so still was this great throng . When my hus  --  band came in and every  --  one rose to his feet , my very heart seemed to stop its beating ... . The War Message After the first ap  --  plause there was utter silence as the President read , until he pro  --  nounced the words : " We will not choose the path of submission . " Whereupon Chief Jus  --  tice White , an ex-Confederate soldier , rose to his feet and cheered . The response from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading was over , my husband waited for me to ex  --  tricate myself from the gallery . Through cheer  --  ing multitudes we drove slowly home in silence . The step had been taken . We were both overwhelmed . While at lunch on April sixth , Mr. Forster , of the Executive Offices , brought in a printed copy of the War Resolution . We all left the table and went into the usher 's room for the President to sign . I asked him to use a gold pen lie had given me . Present also were Mr. I. H. Hoover , the head usher , and Mr. Starling , of the Secret Service . When my husband had written his name , Hoover pressed a button to notify the Navy Department , and Mr. Forster lifted the receiver of a tele  --  phone which he held in his hand , to give the news to the reporters waiting in the Executive Offices . I am told that the longest hours of work obserhked in the Army training camps were in those for young officers , where reveille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed at 9:00 P.M. This working day was criticized by some as too long , on the ground that men not driven to the point , or constant fatigue would be capable of better work . That is a sub  --  ject on which I am not competent to pass . But if such a schedule was , in  --  deed , too burdensome for healthy men in their twenties and thirties , I think the same observation would apply to the White House wartime routine . There the day began at five . Before six the President was at his desk , and often he was there at midnight . People descended upon the White House until their coming and going was like the rise and fall of the tides . To achieve anything amid such dis  --  tractions called for the most rigid rationing of time . Otherwise the re-suit would have been chaos . I know that the emotional drain and the work combined were too much for me , and after we had been in the war just eight days I had to take a day off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . He read me a paper he had prepared , appealing for the co  --  operation of American industry . When he had finished , I asked if he should not include the railroads . " I had for  --  gotten them , " he said gravely . " My brain is just too tired to act . " I called the girls  --  Margaret Wilson and Helen Bones  --  and told them they must make Woodrow go with them to the theater . They went , and on their return all three trooped into my room . My hus  --  band seemed a different person for the relaxation . After that experience I needed no one to tell me what my most important war work would be . Talking the matter over with Doctor tlrayson , he said the President should have some new form of exercise to supplement his golf . Naturally , the doctor , who was raised in a saddle , suggested riding . Accord  --  ingly , I said to my husband that I would like to take up horseback riding . Woodrow said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him pick a mount for me . Results tumbled upon me quicker than I had anticipated when , the next afternoon , I was bidden to be ready to ride at . five o'clock with Doctor Gray  --  son and my husband . By borrowing Margaret 's breeches , Nell McAdoo 's coat and Altrude Gordon 's boots , I was ready on time . Doing Our Bit Thereafter our rides became a reg  --  ular thing , and I think about the only piece of wearing apparel I bought that summer was a riding habit . This small self-denial was in keeping with a pledge duly signed . A few days after the decla  --  ration of war , the Cabinet ladies and I had subscribed to a pledge " to reduce living to its simplest form and to deny ourselves luxuries in order to free those who produce them for the cultivation or necessities . We have decided to omit the usual entertaining and to eliminate largely our social activities to enable us to give more time and money to con  --  structiveh preparedness and relief work . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy simple clothing and food and not de  --  mand out-of-season delicacies . We make an appeal to all women of Amer  --  ica to do everything in their power 44 along these lines , not only as individ  --  uals but as organizations , to hasten the end of the struggle and win the war . " When the former President. , Taft , called on my husband on Red Cross matters , Helen Bones , Edith Benham and I were upstairs doing our first stint of Red Cross work . Margaret had al  --  ready embarked on a concert tour , which she concluded in June , turning over the receipts , about 510.000 , to the Red Cross . The sewing machine I had brought to the White House after my marriage was moved into a small room next to Helen 's , which thereaf ter was the sewing room . We had goods and patterns , and began that day cutting out and basting pajamas . This little unit operated throughout the war , in  --  distinguishable from tens of thousands of others . Mother and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I re  --  member one evening when I had the rare pleasure of having four of my brothers to dinner . I persuaded Helen to take Woodrow to the theater while I sewed and the boys played billiards . Our occasional holidays on the May  --  flower ceased with the war . On one of our last week ends on the yacht we had seen a speck on the Chesapeake Bay chart marked Tangier Island and had asked if we could not put in and inspect it . Captain Berry said we should reach that part of the river very early next morning , and he would send the launch over to see what the conditions were . In the morning he reported the water about Tangier Is  --  land too shallow for the launch , but feasible for a rowboat . Accompanied by two of the officers and the Secret Service staff , we transshipped to the tiny boat , landed on a wooden dock and made our precarious way over a. single plank which led to dry land at one mid of the small street which com  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neat little one-story houses , each with a tiny front garden surrounded by a picket fence . The yards contained the family graves , marked by simple headstones . We walked the entire length of the village , and , at though by this time it was nearly DOOR , we saw only closed doors and drawn blinds ; not a person in sight . It truly seemed a city of the dead . Af ter returning to the dock , the Presi  --  dent . said : " Let 's go back again and see if we can find out what this means . " Deserted Village Comes to Life About the nearest houses we found no sign of life , as before , but , at the far end of the street , our return had taken the inhabitants by surprise . The people were all outside . But the moment they saw us they sped back into their houses and closed and locked the doors . Only one old man stood his ground , peering at us through his glasses . My husband lifted his cap . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope we are not disturbing your quiet homes hero . " The old fellow stood agape and , slowly removing his own hat , he said : " Is n't this the President ? " When Mr. Wilson replied , " Yes , I have that honor , sir , " the old man broke into a great laugh and said : " Well , sir , I want to shake your hand , for we all think a lot of you down here . " He continued to laugh , and then told us that early that morning they had seen a big ship anchor out  --  side in the river , then some men in uniform put out in small boats for their island . They decided that the officers were Germans coming to blow up the island . They had been greatly relieved , however , when the men did January 7. rladla not land , and thought they wore safe , until a second time a boat put out and headed for their abode . Then the peo  --  ple held hasty counsel and , decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had better shut . their doors and win  --  dows , and pray . The old fellow added : " Well , sir , when I saw your lady with you , I kinder felt she would n't be with Ger  --  mans ; so I thought I 'd just stay out here , and she would see there was no harm in me . " Then he begged to go and tell his friends . In a moment the street was filled , and everyone wanted to shake hands with the President . We often went back to see our friends after that , and bought crabs or fish For our Sunday luncheons . This little village is worth a visit , for I know of none other like it ; without a horse or motor on the island , it seems re  --  moved from the modern world . Wartime Washington no less so than a crowd of onlookers who tore the picketers ' banner down . A little later the suffragettes dis  --  played a banner so outrageous that the police arrested them . Imagine our sur  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed Collector of the Port of Now York , defended these women . Nevertheless , they were sentenced to sixty days . I was blazing with anger at ivlatono 's conduct , and my husband was deeply hurt . He sug  --  gested pardoning the women , though not because Mr. Malone had defended them . He said they must not be made martyrs of . Mr. Tumults , opposed the pardon , but the next day , after a round of golf with Doctor Grayson and me , the President signed the paper . The visit of the Russians raised hopes that at last the great resources of that country would make themselves felt against the enemy . My husband was not so sanguine about this . One afternoon my brother Randolph and were motoring with him when he re  --  marked that he did not like the news coining out of Russia . " I feel certain , " he said , " that they will soon be in a state of revolution . " Mr. Edward N. Hurley , chairman of the Shipping Board , asked me if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the Govern  --  ment had taken over . I requested a list of the original names and the tonnage of each vessel . I was seated in the study , where my husband was working under the old green-shaded lamp , when the list came . When I saw the tonnage of the Vaterland I exclaimed and read it aloud . He looked up . " Well , that one is easy , for it would have to be the Leviathan . " He also named the small  --  est one , which became the Minnow . When I found that five Lloyd 's regis  --  ters must be consulted to avoid dupli  --  cations , I ran into complications , never dreaming that there were so many ships in the world . I started to use the names of American cities , rivers , lakes , mountains , and so on , and was sur  --  prised to find that most of them had been previously used . So I fell back on Indian names , which had really been my first idea , but discarded because most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than the fact that I , myself , am of Indian descent , explains the use of the Indian names . With the first eighty-two out of the way , Mr. Hurley asked me to name the new ships that were coming off the ways . There were hundreds of them . I sent to the Library of Congress for Indian dictionaries and pressed my brother Randolph into service . We tried for short and pretty names , and exhausted the supply very soon . After struggling with the jaw-breakers , I would get up a list of a hundred names . Randolph would go to work with Lloyd 's and scratch out forty as al  --  ready used . Trivial as it may seem , as the war went on and other duties in  --  creased , this work of naming the ships became a genuine burden . I would finish one list , take a deep breath , send it in to Mr. Hurley and receive , with his note of thanks , a longer list of new and nameless ships . The more I think of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimism during those war days , the greater he seems to me . No matter what the burden was , he never complained . He was always ready to help , even in trifling matters on which I would ask his judgment , and always accessible to any who had a claim on his consideration . His expression , in one of his speeches , that he had " a one-track mind , " has been so often quoted that I mention it only to dem onstrate my point . He could get off the official " track " and run on his per  --  sonal " track " as completely as though the two were closely parallel . When he left his desk or office , he apparently closed that door in his mind and was ready to play ; then he would play with the abandon of a boy . Fre  --  quently , at night we would go to the Oval Room upstairs after dinner and he would put a. record on the phonograph and say : " Now show you how to do a jig step . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he envied Prim rose , the minstrel dancer , and wished he could exchange jobs with him . Mr. Wilson enjoyed vaudeville and was a regular patron of Keith 's The  --  ater . No matter how foolish the skit. be said it rested him because it took his mind off responsibilities and refreshed his spirit to see light-hearted people who " took on no more at their heads than they could kick off at their heels . " Returning from any recreation , my husband would go to his study for a look at . the Drawer  --  the special re  --  ceptacle in his desk where papers re  --  quiring immediate attention were placed . Though it . may have been bare when we departed , often he would find it filled again . Sitting down be  --  side his green-shaded lamp , he would take up one paper after another , and so work until the small hours , After a. long White House reception my husband loved to get upstairs and twist his face about as an actor does in playing character parts . His muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trol over them , he could make his ears move and elongate his face or broaden it at will in a perfectly ludicrous way . He said that after hours of polite greet  --  ings and " smirks , " commonly called " smiles , " his face needed resting , just as other muscles needed exercise . Editor'n Note  --  Thin in the fourth of , , series of article , by Mrs. Wilson . The fifth .11 appear next week ( Continued Iran% Page 11 ) rotting truck wheels on the slope against glittering emptiness of air . Like the end of the Machine Age , with , I swear it , a tiny eagle caught soaring down beyond . In that flick of an eye he had got it and crawled in again , grinning . Later , I saw it was the split-second , lightning accuracy of pure genius . The top at last seemed the utter up-fling of the stony world , as we waited for John to fill the steaming radiator from the water can and Henry went crawling along knife-edged shale for pictures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the void . I stared down into Montenegro , a welter of lower rocks and , far beyond , a tiny gleam of plain . There , after jarring hours of a lesser descent we ate hot mutton in a low white masonry house , among plush chairs and photographs of mustachioed Montenegrins , and I heard Henry Ger  --  rish ask our host , the Red Cross man in this Cetinje , if he knew for certain that Miss Edith Chandler was in Podgoritsa . " I 'll say she is , " he said . She came through here inspecting the other day . Gave me hell because she caught some of the people selling Red Cross relief clothing in the market place . But who cares if some of the poor beggars would rather eat than keep warm ? The idea was to get the stuff distributed . I swear I do n't see how they stand her at head  --  quarters . Able woman , of course , " he said with sudden politeness . " Friend of yours ? " " No , " said Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dusty plain was easier , and we rode drugged with high sun and fine , thin air and the increasing fatigue of jolting until Podgoritsa 's low houses rose around us after dark  --  yellow lights and American voices , a staircase in candlelight and a place to wash . I forgot all about Henry Gerrish . A girl in uniform walked me a few cob  --  bled blocks to lamplight over the long clean tables of our messroom , smells of coffee and bacon , and familiar friendly new faces . I was marched up and pre  --  sented , at the head of the first table , to Miss Chandler . There she was . Really . I hardly be  --  lieved it . She looked like any other chief nurse I had known  --  perhaps a little neater , in the same blue serge , her hat brim a little straighter across straight brows , a straight. , brown-eyed glance , a straighter nose , a straighter chin . Her very lapels were tighter over a neat rigid breast . I do n't know what extraordinary thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her mouth closed back in its firm cold line . I would n't have said she was a woman to like easily , or to remember long . ) And then I swear the skin up my spine stung with sudden excitement , for there was Henry Gerrish , looming in the doorway . I held my breath . His face hung there behind those masking glasses , and one hand was at that pocket at his breast . She looked at him , looked away . I saw that a corner of his mouth jerked once . Then he clumped forward with his head down . I said , because it seemed to me somebody had to say something , " Miss Chandler , you know  --  ah  --  this is Henry Gerrish . " There was no change in her face . She said , " How do you do ? " Ho hung there , ungainly , huge , faintly ridicu  --  lous , his knuckles whitening on a chair back . It seemed to me that I could not stand the tension . Then the elder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose with his hand out . " Gerrish , of all things ! What are you doing here ? Met you in Coblenz . Hero  --  sit down here ! Well , this is a pleasure ! " Miss Chandler raised inquiring eye  --  brows at me . There were really very well-shaped bones under the tanned firm skin of her face . But I was not warmed . I said , " My department , publicity , is most fortunate to have Mr. Gerrish join us here . Unquestionably the greatest American photographer we 've ever had . He came only because he wanted ? " What would happen to her firm face if I finished the sentence ? She murmured , hardly moving her lips , " I shall he glad to have some pho  --  tographs of the new operating room . " Seeing Henry G enish 's moony glasses turned steadily on her from the end of the table , I could not tell her that he did only what he chose , in his own way . My head was still full of them both , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my shutters at a shaking thud of boots in the street below . The starlight fell on a moving mass of men , a platoon of Serbs , goose-stepping  --  sur  --  prisingly enough  --  between the silent houses . They did not sing , and it was strange , suddenly , to find soldiers even here . Around the town the dusty plain lay , green-silvered by the moon , and the mountains raised their rocks . But it was people now , more than geography , that astonished me . Yet in the morning it was Montene  --  gro that must absorb me , in an attempt to see its relief problem fresh and pe  --  culiar to itself , at this time when in every country in the European patch  --  work , hunger , disease , exhaustion , wretchedness repeated the same worn-out , insane tale . Brushed and tidied as much as possible , therefore , I went to headquarters after breakfast , to present my papers to whoever was acting com  --  missioner . The commissioner was in Belgrade , struggling with Serb , Croat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief elothingand use medical supplies . It was not all charity on our part . The stuff would have cost too much to ship home and our unpaid workers were still interested and eager . I had liked , at breakfast , the morning snap and trimness of this small friendly unit . I liked headquarters , the few up  --  stairs rooms around the corner from the women 's house where I slept . The sunlight streamed through clean windows onto the scrubbed floor of the main room with the worn American magazines , old phonograph , tea things and fireplace of their simple communal life . From the front offices there was already the racket of a typewriter . The blonde clerical worker at the fil  --  ing case grinned at me as I stuck my head in the door . I said I wanted to present my letters . The brunette one , whom they called Reno , because she in  --  sisted she lived there and it was a swell town , said , " Doctor King is Acting , but he does n't come in much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you she 'd arranged for you to see the clothing warehouse this morning and the hospital this afternoon . Two clinics today . She is arranging a clothing dis  --  tribution for you in a day or two . She wants the photographer at the hospital at eight tomorrow for the operating-room pictures . She will see you in her office at four . Here are the reports which she thought would interest you . After you read them she will be glad to answer any questions . " When she stopped for breath , the blonde one , in the same brisk tone , said , " The Great Stone Face has spoken . " Then they both laughed , and Reno winked at me and went briskly on with her work . I saw the clothing warehouse . I went to the hospital . I did not tell Henry Gerrish he was to take operating-room interiors , partly because I did n't see him , and partly because I would n't have anyway . But everywhere I went I was conscious that when the com  --  missioner was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief nurse . I had never met this situation before , but it was a very good piece of work indeed , which was all that mattered . My only criticism might have been that there was too much clothing left in the warehouse . But Mr. Ryan , the warehouseman , told me that Miss Chandler did not approve of indis  --  criminate giving . I had nothing but
