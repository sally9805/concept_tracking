txt The long-submerged struggle between Secretary Ickes and Harry L. Hopkins , Works Progress Administrator , regarding the type of projects to be dominant in the vast workrelief program just getting under way flared into the open today and will be carried to President Roosevelt at Hyde Park tomorrow for a final showdown . The first indication that the dispute would be put up to President Roosevelt came when Secretary Ickes declared in his press conference today that the 1,908 PWA projects which were recommended to the Advisory Committee on Allotments for rejection by Mr. Hopkins were " all good projects . " He made it clear that he would ask the committee to overrule Mr. Hopkins 's recommendation . He will go to Hyde Park in the morning to pre-sent his side of the case accompanied by Charles West , Under-Secretary of Interior and until recently the Presidents contact man with Congress , and Horatio B. Hackett , assistant administrator . Mr. Hopkins will follow Thursday and Frank C. Walker , director of the Division of Applications and Information and third of the work relief " big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House . Heavy or Light Work Issue . The issue at stake is whether PWA heavy construction requiring a large material outlay and relatively high labor costs shall play a large part in the program as Secretary Ickes wishes or be virtually eclipsed by Mr. Hopkins 's light con- struction projects calling for minimum material costs and a maximum wage of $94 monthly . " The President called me last night and asked me to come up tomorrow , " Mr. Ickes remarked . " I thought I 'd go . " The open break , which was said to be the result of honest differences of opinion , came just two days before the Sept. 12 deadline set by President Roosevelt for the receipt of applications for work relief funds and after the government had virtually cleared the decks for the expenditure of $5,000,000,000 on the new program . Confidence was expressed in official circles that the President would be able to settle the difficulty as he-has similar differences between members of his staff in the past . The opinion was expressed in some other quarters , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cabinet casualty , if his views did not prevail . The Secretary , who is chairman of the Allotment Committee , said that he had not yet called a meeting of the committee to consider the final applications , although President Roosevelt has asked that one be called Sept. 17 , and that he did not know when he would call one . None Has Right of Veto . " When this tripartite organization to administer the work relief money was set up , no individual member was given the right to veto a project , " Mr. Ickes said . " All that was provided was that certain information could be annexed to each- project application for the benefit of the other members of the Allotment Committee . " The Secretary insisted that Mr. Hopkins had objected to the PWA projects for which rejection was counseled because of " too great cost , " whereas the estimated cost per man per year on these projects was , but $958 , well below the $1,143 average fixed by President Roosevelt .

Waxing sarcastic , Mr. Ickes remarked , " I never was very much good at figures . I do n't think I 'm the only one in the government anyway . I did n't know a yardstick could slide . " The Secretary made a second caustic reference to Mr. Hopkins when asked what he thought of the alleged action of a WPA official in writing a newspaper that the Sept. 12 deadline could be exceeded . Not Member of His Staff . " The gentleman is not a member of my staff , " Mr. Ickes said . " If he were , I 'd send him a wire that the President 's wishes must be . carried out . " Mr. Hopkins said laughingly that he would not attempt to " beat " Secretary Ickes to Hyde Park . " I have altogether too much work to do , " he said . " Mr. Ickes and I have no quarrel .

Below Earmarked Figure . The sum requested from new funds was far below the $900,000,000 earmarked by Congress for public works , but Secretary Ickes was obviously afraid that even this sum would be restricted . " What amount will be made available for PWA projects , I ca n't say today , " he remarked . He added that the volume of applications was " gratifying " and indicated that " the country is behind PWA . " Critics of PWA have said that too few men are put to work for the amount of money expended and that because of the PWA contract system the work has often lagged . Mr. Hopkins 's light construction program has been characterized by its critics as " too close to leafraking .
