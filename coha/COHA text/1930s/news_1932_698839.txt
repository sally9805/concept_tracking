txt THE BANKRUPTCY BILL . Measure Does Not Lack Support of Business Organizations . To the Editor of The New York Times : There was published in THE TIMES a letter from Max Isaac , secretarytreasurer of the Association of Federal Practitioners , with respect to the bankruptcy bill now pending in Congress . Mr. Isaac , who is the official spokesman for a group of commercial attorneys specializing in bankruptcy practice , gives the impression in his letter that the pending bill is an attempt by the " credit interests of the country " to impose their views with respect to reform of bankruptcy practice and procedure upon the country as a whole . The history of the bill is a conclusive answer to such contention . An investigation of the administration of the bankruptcy law was ordered by President Hoover on July 29 , 1930 . The investigation was undertaken by the Department of Justice under the direction of Solicitor General Thacher , and the results of the investigation are embodied in a voluminous report to Congress , printed as Senate Document No. 65 , Seventy-second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Solicitor General and introduced in the Senate by Senator Daniel 0 . Hastings of Delaware and in the House by Representative Earl C. Michener of Michigan . Witnesses who have appeared before the joint committees of the Senate and House in the course of the hearings on the bill , with the exception of certain commercial lawyers and representatives of groups of commercial lawyers . have been unanimous in praising the scholarly and analytical report of the Attorney General and commending the principles embodied in the bill . Committees appointed by the National Association of Manufacturers , the American Bankers ' Association , the National Retail Credit Men 's Association , the National Association of Credit Men , the Silk Association , the Musical Industries Chamber of Commerce and many other associations of business men throughout the United States have without exception stated their approval of the bill in principle . Individual business men representing important business and banking houses have voluntarily appeared before the committee and emphatically voiced the necessity for the changes proposed by the Solicitor General as evidenced by their personal experiences . The implication , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in the interest of any particular group is obviously unjustified . The organizations of business men which are supporting the bill represent in their membership practically the entire substantial business interests of the United States . Members of all of these organizations are actively engaged in the extension of credit and are the ones whose losses are represented by the $1,000,000,000 of liabilities reported in bankruptcy proceedings annually-in this country . There are honest differences of opinion , to be sure , with respect to the language employed in the bill , - and the assistance of the bar by constructive criticism is welcomed and such criticism is being given careful consideration not only by the business organizations but by the framers of the bill themselves . Some sections of the bill will have to be rewritten in the light of just criticism . and I understand that this will be done before Congress reconvenes in December . I have attended many sessions of the hearings before the Congressional committees and I am fully conversant with the testimony both of the proponents and the opponents of the bill . No testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the committee which has shaken the faith Of the business organizations in the soundness of the principles involved . The constitutionality of the proposals contained in the bill has been the subject of careful study by eminent lawyers , and so far as I am informed no competent legal authority who has studied the question has presented any authorities to the committee which throw any doubt upon the power of Congress to enact a bill substantially as proposed by the Solicitor General . It is the considered judgment of the business interests of the country , as expressed by their national and local organizations , that radica ' changes in the administration of the bankruptcy law and in many of its . important provisions , substantially as proposed by the Solicitor General , are essential to make the act con ? form with conditions under which business is transacted at the present time .
