Last spring Madam Secretary of Labor Perkins suggested that the automobile industry ( which now runs frantically night &; day for a few months and then coasts through the rest of the year ) , might well spread production more evenly throughout the twelvemonth . One good way to accomplish that , said she , was to turn the big national automobile shows over to dealers . Then the motormakers would not be so anxious to introduce almost all their models at the same time . <P> The big Manhattan automobile show will be run by dealers next January but it looks as if the industry would concentrate more model announcements around the year-end than ever before . Madam Perkins ' idea however was not wholly lost on the industry . <P> Last fortnight in extending the automobile code President Roosevelt revealed that the motormakers were seeking ways &; means of smoothing out the seasonal sales curve and declared that he , too , had ordered a study made . And last week General Motors became the first member of the industry to appropriate the Perkins plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late summer or early fall , " President Alfred Pritchard Sloan Jr . wrote his stockholders . " Normally approximately 60% of the industry 's yearly output is sold to consumers in the first six months . Consumer sales in November and December are approximately 7% of the total for the year , against 24% for April and May . . . . <P> " Additional workers are required for the peak season , with but limited opportunity for employment in the balance of the year . Longer hours are essential for the whole working force in the peak season to offset the short hours when merchandise can not be sold except in greatly reduced quantity . " <P> Consensus in the trade was that GM would offer its fast-selling , lower-priced Pontiacs , Chevrolets and Oldsmobiles around the year-end , save its Buicks , La Salles and Cadillacs for midseason . Since most of GM 's sales are in the lower-priced models , the stagger plan will still leave some pretty jagged jiggles in the GM production curve .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
