no . Look him straight in the eye : Listen , pipe down , I 'll take care of it . Or no . Look him straight in the eye , grin , nodding slightly , Rave on , rave on . Yowl What a shock ! His face dazed , his eyes popping out of his head , Carl gulped , looked around , stammering uneasily , " Now , see here . . . . " Yow ! Baby ! All at once he remembered his father telling him sternly to take it easy , and the memory cooled him off like a bucket of cold water poured over him . Tell Frankie to watch the heat ! I 'm a nut , he thought despondently . No wonder he thinks I 'm a nut . But immediately he jumped to his own defense again . Why not ? he thought . I 'm not cut out for this kind of work . It 's too heavy for me . He thought of straightening up and bowing down behind the rattling machine , piling the endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , every night for the rest of his life . The thought cut through him ; it hurt him like a cramp ; he could not think of anything else when he thought of it . Leaning over and straightening up , all night long , while his eyes burned and his back ached and the sweat ran down his face , every night for the rest of his life  --  his blood ran cold when he thought of it ; his mind went blank ; he had to think about something cheerful to drive it away . He sighed and put his hand against the press . Why was he always looking at the dark side of things ? he wondered . Why could n't he look at the bright side , just for a change ? Tell Frankie to watch the heat ! Suddenly he heard voices on the far side of the press . They were quite near . He leaped to attention , alert , inquisitive , creepingto the edge of the press so he could hear better . " He 's a damn liar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " Johnny waited , but there was no answer . Presently he called out , " Do you know where Frankie is ? " " What ? "  | " Do you know where Frankie is ? " There was a pause , heavy with no answer , until after a time a second voice commented vaguely , " He wants to know where Frankie is . " While Johnny waited , he relaxed against the steel wall of the press . He relaxed from weariness , although he did not know it was weariness , for he had as yet found no name for the curioushunger to lie down which attacked him at this hour every night . His hand slipped on the mushy steel surface of the press . Then he wiped his hand against his trousers , thinking that in the darkness this huge piece of machinery felt as though it were made of mashed potatoes . Something he had read once about three blind men and an elephant crossed his mind . He thought about the blind man grabbing the elephant 's trunk and saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some poor blind man got in the factory , what would he think it was like ? " Maybe he 's outside , " the voice said . " There 's a door over there . " Where ? Johnny asked soundlessly . What door ? He waded back through the darkness the way he had come , sneaking around until all at once he came to the secret door and a flight of steps leading down into the darkness . He stopped at the top of the steps . The fresh air tasted good . He breathed with a calisthenic regularity . Something was happening to the sky . While he watched , a red streak spurted over town and climbed toward the clouds , streaming up and up until it crashed suddenlyagainst the far edge of nothing , crashed in a silent explosionand shattered , sending out wonderful bubbles of yellow and blue and red light that sank slowly and went out , leaving the sky as cloudy and as vacant as before . A moment later there was a distant rush of noise , a series of muffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the clouds . He waited until he remembered that he was supposed to bep102delivering a message . A man was leaning against the building directly below him . Johnny cleared his voice and asked , " Do you know where Frankie is ? " The man did not answer , but from the darkness beyond him another voice said , " Here I am . What do you want ? " " Carl said to tell you to watch the heat . " " All right . " That was all . Did n't anybody know how hard it was to get from one end of the factory to the other ? Steaming and sweatingand bumping into things and barking his shins ? After all this , was Frankie only going to sit there without moving ? Anybodycould tell that it was too hot in the factory . But Frankie merely sat by the wall and continued to smoke a cigarette . " The son of a bitch , " Frankie said abruptly . There was no response , and no more talking . Another rocket lifted over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond came to life for an instant , the trees looking gray and mildewed . The boy dropped down the steps and found a place for himself , somewhat away from the others , on a pile of steel casks . The words kept swinging through his mind , Tell Frankie to watch the heat , like some nagging song he tried to forget and could n't . All that , the bawling out , running through the factory , barking his shins , all for nothing ! And now Frankie did n't move ; he sat there like a bump on a log ; and now Carl would think he had n't delivered the message , and would probably fire him . Yes , and then there would be hell to pay ! What 's the use ? he asked himself drearily ; the workingman has n't got a chance ; he works like a dog , and what good does it do him ? All right , let them fire me . All right , fire me , he thought , if you want to fire a man for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time a cold uneasiness crept over him as he thought of what the folks would say if he got fired , of his mother sighing and apologizing for him , sayingnot to worry about it . . . . Then another rocket sailed over town , and the dark gloomy thoughts flapped away , , scattering like crows frightened when a shot is fired . P103Johnny looked about him carefully to see if anyone was near before he lit a cigarette . He shielded the flame of the match with his hand , a trick he had learned after hours of secret practice . He had bought a package of cigarettes after his first night at work , but he was still shy about smoking them for fear people would think he was showing off . Also , it was difficult for him to light a cigarette . He could get it lighted most of the time , but he could not keep it lighted after it was lit . If he smoked he was able to keep the cigarette burning , but this meant that his lungs would fill up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel generally despondent , and it did not seem worth the trouble it caused him . He drew back behind the steel barrels and struck a match , jumping nervously because the light flared over a wide area and because he knew his features must be clearly outlined and visible even from the factory . In a momentary agitation , as he attempted to cover the flame , he burned the palm of his hand . He dropped the match at once and pressed his hand to his lips , sucking at the carbony residue of smoked flesh and rocking his head from side to side with the pain . And now what ? He hated to light another match . All the men sitting around , he thought , would know he had been unable to light his cigarette with one match . Even now , in his fancy , they were sitting back snickering and whispering to one another , " Look at that kid , he ca n't even light a cigarette . " But then , he thought , if he did n't try to light it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had given up because he did n't have nerve enough to try again . For a moment , in a helpless and harrowing nervousness , he pretended that his cigarette was actually lighted all the time , and pretended to be smoking it , but this ruse was obviously unsuccessful , and the dead taste of the unburning tobacco hurt his throat . In the darkness he took the cigarette from his lips with a gesture indicating extreme surprise . What ! he exclaimed soundlessly , not lighted after all ! and gave way to silent astonish-P104ment while he searched through his pockets for another match . Then he climbed down behind the barrels and hid himself as much as he could while the light flared and the tip of his cigarette began to glow . With his desperate manner , as well as his appearance of secrecy , he gave an impression of attempting to set fire to the factory . As he sat down again he heard someone scrambling across the barrels . He ditched his cigarette . " Say ! " this newcomer asked unexpectedly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , " he said . He was much surprised . " Why yes , " he repeated . " That is , yes , sure . " " I thought so ! I thought I recognized you ! Maybe you know me  --  Connor 's my name , Walt Connor . " Johnny jumped to his feet . This was something like it ! " Hagen 's mine , " he responded warmly , clasping Walt 's outstretchedhand , " John Hagen . Glad to know you . " This was more like it , he thought with pleasure , this was the way fellows introduced themselves to each other in college , or even in high school if they were smart and willing to get out in the world and learn how to meet people . So he shook hands warmly , pressing Walt 's palm with great vigor because he had frequentlyheard that there was no surer sign of a weak character than a flabby handshake . " Well , " Walt said , " I never thought I 'd see you here , Hagen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Johnny replied , somewhat off at a tangent . " I never thought I 'd see you here either . " " You just starting ? " " A week , " Johnny said . " This is the end of my first week . " " Where you work ? " " I 'm off-bearing behind the cut-off saw . " " Ah , " Walt said . " That was the first job I had when I came here . " " Was it ? " " Yeah . I worked there about three months , then I got putp105on the kiln and then I got put out in the stockroom and now I 'm breaking down presses . " He could see Walt 's large face and the expanse of his white shirt . A white shirt , he thought : How does he keep it from getting dirty ? He remembered him as the president of the Student Council and the president of his class and getting two letters in football the year they never won a game . He flicked the ashes off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walt asked . " Yeah . " " You going on ? " " Yeah . Well , " Johnny said , " that is , I do n't know . I want to go this fall , but my old man wo n't let me and I thought maybe I 'd save enough money by the time school started , but now I was supposed to be getting three and a half a day to start  --  when I started I heard that was the lowest they paid  --  but now I found out tonight I only get two and a quarter . I was supposed to get two and a half the timekeeper told me , but then they gave everybody a ten per cent cut . " Walt nodded . " How much did you get ? " " Well , I only worked three days on last pay day , so my check was only five dollars and twenty-five cents because they took out a dollar for insurance and fifty cents for the doctor or something and then they took off a lot for other things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you 'll go to college this fall , does it ? " He drew back at a note of satisfaction in Walt 's voice . Rubbingit in , he thought . " No , " he said . " Are you going back ? " Walt sat down . " How the hell can I ? " he said bitterly . " I 've been working here almost a year . I have n't saved a cent . My old man ca n't give me any money  --  I have to give him money . If I do n't we 'll lose our house . What chance have I got ? " Chilled , Johnny said , " That 's tough . " He sat down beside Walt on one of the oil cases . What a life ! He took a weakp106drag on his cigarette . Why look at the dark side of things ? he thought . Why not look at the bright side once in a while ? " I 'll go back , " Walt said grimly , " some way or other ; I wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't stay at this lousy job . I work like a dog now and I have to work harder all the time . The Polack I work with , he gives me the heavy end of every truck . He knows I 'm new on that job and he shoves off everything on me . . . . Hell , at first here I had it soft ; I was working with Winters and he was breaking me in , but now I work like a dog . You work with Winters ? " " Yeah . " " He 's a good guy to work with . He 's the only one here I like ; he 's the only one that do n't try to make it hard for you if you 're a new man . These God-damn Polacks , hell , they knife you every chance they get . " Johnny listened . He sat back and let his cigarette burn down and listened . Walt moved around restlessly , sometimes beatinghis fist impatiently against his open palm . " All they do is beef , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got a chance at a good job and they 're making a lot of trouble . . . . " Another skyrocket sailed over town . " If I was back in school ! " Walt said . " You do n't know what you miss . Now I 'd appreciate it . Now I 'd know what to get out of it . Before , all I did was run around and blow in the old man 's dough . After the football season I was drunk three nights every week . Girls used to come around begging for it . " Johnny sighed and tried to sit back more comfortably . " I 'm going to go , " he said . " Sooner or later . If the old man ca n't send me I 'll find some way . " Walt gave a skeptical grunt . He said nervously , " They all do it . Even Winters . They beef all the time . You ca n't depend on them . All these foreigners try to take advantage of you . If you do n't stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for . Like this Polack I work with . He knows I 'm a new man , so he thinks I ca n't tell when he 's shoving off all the work onp107me . . . . It reminds me , " Walt said , " of a story I read once in The Saturday Evening Post . It was in them lumber camps up in the Canadian woods ; a college man went up there , and the French Canadians , tough bastards , tried to raise hell with him . Put icicles in his bed , and stole his shoes and did every Goddamnthing . You know , they tried to break him ; if he was yellow , they 'd beat the hell out of him . Finally he beat some of them up , and they saw they could n't walk over him . " " I think I read that story , " Johnny said . " There was a big fight in the end where they jumped on each other with their calked shoes and tried to gouge each other 's eyes out , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tipped back , looking out across the tideflat , he seemed preoccupied and determined ; Johnny felt sort of sorry for the Polack . He wondered vaguely if they were trying to put anything over on him because he was a new man ; but the only person who could be doing it was Winters , or maybe Carl . " Gee , " he said , " it certainly seems funny  --  I never thought  --  what I mean is , everybody here ! Sort of hard to get along with ! " " Yes , " Walt agreed . He lit a cigarette . Inhaling thoughtfully , with his head thrown back , he flicked the match out on the tideflat . " A bunch of Polacks , " he said . " They 're all Polacks . The squarehead I work with drives me nuts . " Here Johnny felt a little chill . After all , his father worked in the factory , and he worked in it too , so it was hardly fair to go calling them all Polacks just because they worked in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course some of the fellows are all right , " he said . " Winters is all right . But most of these guys are hopeless . The goofy Polack I work with now , he always gives me the heavy end of every truck . Some day I 'm going to lam him one . He thinks he 's putting it over on me and that I do n't know what he 's doing . Some day I 'm not going to say a word , I 'm just going to haul off and paste him one . I do n't care if they fire me for it . "  |p108Somewhat  impressed by this determination , Johnny did not say anything . The spasms of the rockets followed one another at periodic intervals , and once an underslung tugboat , with its mast and stack tilted so it could pass under the bridges , floated by close to shore . The men stretched out in their varied attitudesof repose , crabbing to each other in low voices , or stirring to rest more comfortably or to light their cigarettes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry and longing . Supposehe could n't go to college ? For the last year , all during his senior year at high school , he had been worried about it ; all his friends were going ; everybody knew that ninety-nine per cent of the men in Who 's Who were college graduates . But how could he go ? He was beginning to see that unless somebody left him a lot of money , or he won a prize or something , he would n't have a chance ; his father would never earn enough to send him ; and now with all the family home . . . . As he listened to Walt he thought about something he had read , about dusk stealing over the campus and the late students hurrying from the ivy-covered buildings toward the lighted fraternity houses and the sound of young carefree voices rising from Fraternity Row . What could he do if he did n't go to college ? Work in the factory all his life ? The thought of it made his blood run cold . When Walt , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blunt , English pipe and said he guessed he would stoke up , Johnny was thinking about college with such intensity that he was almost in despair . Suppose he could not get to college ? Suppose he could not get enough money , ever ? Suppose his father never earned any more than he did now ? Suppose he had to work in the factory for the rest of his life ? Oh , he thought , why am I always looking on the dark side of things ? He sat back and listened to Walt , dreaming of the ivy-covered halls , the long slopes of green lawn , the beautiful coeds , each with her own sports roadster , giving herself so gaily and pas/sionately with a true F. Scott Fitzgerald abandon ; yes , and long canoe rides on the lake , with the water lapping the frail sides of the fragile craft , and long bull-fests , blue with tobacco smoke , before the open fire of the country-club fraternity house , and fellows smoking pipes sitting up all night chewing the fat about philosophy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard work too , cramming for exams in the spring , when the air was raw and the leaves off the trees , staying up all night drinking hot coffee and cramming for exams tomorrow morning . And the beautifulgirls , each lovely coed with streamlined hips and dainty breasts barely perceptible under a clinging pull-over sweater , pinned down and yielding on the secret davenports of a dark sorority house . " The Dekes are a good house , " Walt said . " We got some good men . " Johnny decided that soon he too would buy a pipe . A lot of questions began circling around in his mind . " I been wondering , " he said hesitantly , " what I mean is , I read an editorialonce , are fraternities a good thing ? This editorial , I remember , it said they made for an un-American snobbishness among the students , sort of , like Greece and Rome . " " Hah ! " Walt said . " What the hell . Some independent probably wrote it , some sorehead , son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he 's got a grudge against them . You run into that all the time . " " That 's what I thought . " They were silent for a time . " Then I was reading in College Days  --  there was an article  --  is too much emphasis placed on sport ? You know , it said there was too much emphasis on sport , and the moral standard was low and there was a lot of drinking and orgies going on all the time . " " It makes me smile , " Walt said , " to hear you refer to College Days . " " Why ? " " Well , for one thing , you never see a copy of that magazinewithin ten miles of the campus . Nobody at the house ever read it . "  | " I do n't read it , " Johnny said hastily . " I just happened to pick up a copy , and I saw this article , and I wondered . " Walt sat down , leaning forward with his elbows resting on his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From time to time , between his comments , his pipe gave off a choked , strangled , bubbling sound . " A lot of people , " he began , " think college students are alwaysrunning around and raising hell . " Here he stopped , and Johnny waited breathlessly . Were collegestudents always running around and raising hell ? Walt did not answer him at once . He puffed thoughtfully at his pipe before he said anything , and tamped the tobacco down in the bowl with great care . " As a matter of fact , " he said , " I doubt if you could find a more serious-minded bunch of fellows anywhere than the fellowsin the house . " At this point he stopped , waiting somewhat belligerently to be questioned . Johnny nodded . He had never doubted that the fellows in the house were among the most serious-minded you could find anyhere . " I mean it ! " Walt went on emphatically . " You do n't believe me when I tell you some of the fellows in the house never go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He paused again , and Johnny made a noncommittal uhm ! sound in his throat . " That 's why it 's such a laugh , " Walt went on , after a moment , " when all these people say the fellows never do anything but run around . They have n't time ! How can they ! Why good God ! " he cried with sudden vigor , " Some of these people who are always saying that college is a waste of time never saw the inside of a college ! That 's a fact ! They do n't know a damn thing about it ! " " That 's right , " Johnny said quickly , filled with contempt for all the people who gave snap judgments on things they knew nothing about . Walt removed his pipe from his mouth and spoke with ap111slow , deliberate intensity . " Listen , Hagen , " he said . " Ninety per cent of the fellows at the university are working their way through school . Ninety per cent ! I think it 's ninety per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flynn his name is  --  his folks never gave him a cent . Every summer he had to go to work as a forest ranger . You think that makes any difference ? Ha ! " he exclaimed scornfully . " And then people say it 's only a waste of time ! " They were silent while they considered the injustice of it . " The dirty bastards , " Walt said at last . Nodding , Johnny acknowledged the truth of these remarks . Of course , he thought , naturally the people who did n't know the first thing about colleges would be the first to criticize them . If they knew the facts they would n't be so critical . He was filled with a growing anger against these people who were always saying that college was a waste of time . " The crazy boobs , " he muttered . " Can you imagine it ? " Walt asked . " Can you imagine it ? " " Gosh , " Johnny replied . Then , as this seemed inadequate as an expression of his contempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Terrible ! " Walt roared . " Terrible 's no name for it ! " Johnny was thinking that it certainly was n't true that fraternitiesmade fellows snobbish ! As a matter of fact , he had never believed this , because he thought that it must be a good thing for a lot of congenial fellows to be living together in the same house , sort of sharing each other 's problems , besides the social advantages , such as learning how to meet people and making good contacts that would be useful in later life , for everybody knew that the friendships formed in college were among the most precious things in a man 's life . And from the way Walt Connor , who you 'd expect to be stuck on himself , was acting , coming up and introducing himself and shaking hands in the most natural way in the world , it certainly did n't look as if fraternities made fellows very snobbish !  |p112Checking  his mirth , Walt went on in an **37;2306;TOOLONG , " I wo n't say there are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise general hell and give the school a rotten reputation . I wo n't say there are n't . There are . But what can you expect ? You ca n't get any bunch of healthy young fellows together and expect them to just sit at home all the time . " At first Johnny was sobered to think that there were two sides to every question , but as soon as he saw what Walt was driving at he was reassured . Naturally there would always be some who would want to raise general hell because they were young , like himself ; he would n't expect himself just to sit around all the time , so why expect others ? When Walt was talking about how serious-minded everybody was at the house , Johnny had wondered uneasily if he would be serious-minded enough , but now he saw that there was a way out  --  you could be seriousmindedand still run around and raise hell once in a while if you wanted to . " Of course not , " he replied . Then he took a savage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fraternity men in particular . " What do they expect ? " he asked scornfully . But Walt went even further . " I wo n't say , " he said quietly , " that there are n't some fellows who are n't just looking for trouble and go to college for whatever they can get out of it . Some of them do . I admit it . In fact , I know of one case in particular . . . a fellow you may have heard of  --  fraternity man , too -- you may know him . . . . " Here his voice died away , and he sat back shaking his head while he tamped the tobacco down in his pipe , making quick jabs against the coals with his finger . Johnny waited to find out what the fellow had done . What could he have done ? Steal ? Cheat ? Get some girl in trouble ? Probably he was weak , Johnny thought , not vicious . But as the silence continued , he realized that Walt was not going to say any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he understood thatp113Walt was not going to repeat idle gossip or injure a fellow who was down . It was a real gentlemanly sporting attitude , and the first time Johnny had observed it at such close range . He was deeply stirred , and somewhat awed , but at the same time he racked his brains trying to figure out what the fellow could possibly have done . Suddenly there was a loud scream from the factory . After a moment there was another . Johnny jumped to his feet . What had happened ? He looked at Walt . Should they do anything ? Run back inside ? Was somebody hurt ? But Walt was only listening . There were no more screams . In a moment there was a shout from inside , nor far beyond the nearest wall . Let her up ! Ca n't you see she 's tired ? " They 're screwing in there , " Walt said quietly . Johnny said , " Ah , " in an involuntary expression of disbelief , before he corrected himself with " Are they ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I know . " Johnny turned to stare at the factory again , seeing it dimly outlined against the sky , a huge and shapeless heap of darkness more intense than the darkness surrounding it . His heart beganbeating more rapidly at the thought that people were actuallyscrewing inside , beyond the thin walls a few feet away , in the hot , oppressive silence . Where ? Right there ? He had suspected that the girls were all as hard as nails , but to think that right there , in the factory . . . . " Gosh , " he said . It was too much for him . There was a long silence as they both stared at the lascivious manufacturing plant standing there in the lonely tideflat like a car parked in the bushes beside a country road . Walt put his pipe away . He relaxed and drew a deep breath . " Bunch of chippies , " he said . His voice was a little strained . Johnny nodded . His heart was still pounding . How did Walt know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Probably , he thought . Yes . " God , " Johnny said.  |p114His  hands clenched and he walked a few steps from a restlessnessthat gripped him too suddenly for him to wonder whether it was right or not , whether it was what a fraternity man ought to do . Let her up ! Were they ? he wondered . Or was it merely ? Another burst of fireworks spilled out across the sky in all directions , but he did not look up , scarcely aware of them for the inner excitement that held him . All of them ? Or only a few ? He tried feverishly to remember how the girls looked , but he could not visualize them personally or distinctly ; in his memory they all seemed exactly alike . Walt stood up and stretched . He was a good deal taller than Johnny . He put his hands over his head , clutching at the air and yawning . " I 've got my car here , " he announced . " You have ? " , , yes .  --  A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing else happened . There was no more shouting , no more screaming , only a passionate silence . Johnny felt weak . His legs were beginning to tremble . " Jesus , " Walt said , after a time , " I hated to come to work tonight . I tried every way I could to get out of it . There 'll be a lot going on downtown even after work . I was thinking I might go home and change my clothes and go down to the Biltmore . It only ought to take me about half an hour to get a bath and slip into my tux and get back downtown . . . . " He yawned again , flexing his quarterback muscles . " What a life ! " he said . " Without a wife ! " He turned to Johnny abruptly . " By the way , " he said . " Do you know the two girlssisters  --  workon the table up at this end ? " " Where ? " " One 's tall , " Walt said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen them around town . " His voice was somewhatstiff . " Polacks . You know who I mean . " " Oh , " Johnny said . " The Turner girls . " Now he understood . Putting two and two together , Walt 's  |p115car  and the Turner girls , a cold chill went down his spine as he realized what Walt was suggesting . Now he understood why Walt made such a point of having his car at work . All his life he had known about the Turner girls . Their name was not really Turner . It was Dombroski , or something like that , but they had changed it to Turner when their mother married again . Even in grade school he had known about them . Once some big kids had put Johnny and some of the little kids up to asking the Turner girls if they would for a nail , on the supervisedplayground of the Benjamin Franklin school . Then in high school Marie Turner finally got expelled for doing it under the grandstand with the quarterback of Centralia 's tricky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , living as they did on the wrong side of the river and maintaining a low standard of living like all the foreigners because they sent all their money back home to their folks in the Old Country . When Johnny began to think of himself and the Turner girls in Walt 's car , he thought only I wonder and Suppose , with his mind floundering downstream among the possibilities . " You see I thought , " Walt was saying , " I wondered if you . What I mean is this . If you want to take the little one home , I 'll take her sister . You see ? You know them better than I do . You ask . " Here a quick flash of resistance crossed Johnny 's mind . Why me ? he asked silently . Then , a moment later , a dirty , disloyal thought , cynical and unworthy of him , set him to wondering if Walt had come to him with such complete fraternity-brother affability with this secret mission always at the back of his mind . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such morbidcunning to his new-found friend . " Me , " he said blankly . " Why do n't . . . I mean , why should I. . . . " " It 's my car , " Walt replied  |p116At  this an uncomfortable silence fell . There was no evading the truth of this remark , however depressing it might be . " Besides , " Walt went on , " you know them better than I do . " Here Johnny defended himself again . " I do n't know them . " He felt a twinge of resentment that Walt should think just because his father worked here he was friendly with the Turner girls , although at the same time he would have liked to pretend that he knew them very well . " No , but you 're . . . you 're more in contact with them than I am . " Johnny remained silent . " What the hell ! " Walt said . " What is there to it ? Just go ask them if they want a ride home  --  tell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard about that ? " " Yes , " Johnny said . " But . " Walt walked away . " Of course if you do n't want to . I just thought if you wanted to take the little one I 'd take her sister . But if you do n't want to , what the hell . It do n't mean anything to me . " " No , it ai n't that .... " Walt sat back down again . " Never mind , never mind . " They stared at the dissolute factory building . " Some of these Polacks , " Walt said , " are damn good nooky . " Johnny did not reply . " Come on , do n't be yellow . What the hell . What 's so hard about it ? Just go ask them if they want to ride home ; tell ' em your friend 's got his car here , and he 's perfectly willing to let them ride home  --  what the hell ? Is that so hard ? " " Why do n't you ask them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I alreadyasked Marie . She would n't . I just thought maybe if you was there to take her sister she would . I 'd ask her again only I thought maybe you wanted to take the little one home , and you know them better than I do . Besides , " Walt said , " these God-damn chippies , they sort of look down on a collegep117man . . . . But , Jesus , if you do n't want to , forget it ! It do n't mean anything to me . I just thought maybe you wanted to take the little one home , so I 'd be willing to take her sister . " He strolled off and pitched a few pebbles into the darkness . Johnny tried to think . What should he do ? How begin ? Should he be polite and say , " How do you do , Hagen 's my name , I was wondering if you girls wanted to ride home tonight ? " Or should he be breezy , informal and begin with a happy-go-lucky , carefree smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought but he kept getting cold feet because he could not imagine what they would say in reply . " Come on , " Walt said . " Ask them . What the hell . " And suppose they did agree , then what ? He tried to think of himself with Ellen Turner in the back seat of Walt 's car , in the dark back seat with that little chippie  --  what should he do first ? How begin ? For although he hoped for the best , he could not imagine Ellen Turner , like all the **31;2345;TOOLONG he read about , placing her smooth white arms around his neck and murmuring , You can have me if you want me , darling . You can have me . No . " Come on , " Walt said . " What are you afraid of ? " Listen , a voice said . Just say the word and I 'll walk out.  |p118IN  town too some of the houses were dark . Along the waterfront and in some of the residential districts there were great patches of shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed through them , and from the hill in back of the city these areas were like those parts of maps marked unknown , standing out all the more clearly because the street lights were still burning in the areas around them . In one of the large houses on the hill , Rose MacMahon stood looking down at the tangle of light and dark , attracted by the feverish unreal beauty of the night and repelled by the quarrel that her parents had been having in the house , turning her back on them and trying to close her mind to what they were saying . Upstairs her father was moving around on some mysterioustask . Below the MacMahon house the lawn sloped to the driveway where the car was parked . Beyond the drivewaythere were a few scattered houses and then the hill leveled off to the crowded streets of town , the first widely separated lights growing more dense and frequent until they merged in an indistinguishable glow at the main streets and the lighted tower of the Past Bay National Bank . Over the harbor beyond town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid and firm in the smoky air . The girl looked down at all this , seeing its strangeness for the first time and unconsciously responding , still shaken and exposed after the fury of the quarrel her parents had had , still sick at heart at their crudeness , at the savagery with whichp119they had turned on each other . An hour before she had been composed and waiting ; the house had been quiet . Her mother had been dressing , the girl had been finishing her work in the kitchen and the faint sounds of her movements , the rattle of the dishes and the sound of water being drawn and drained off , had been quiet and familiar and comfortable , and then the peace had been broken when her father came home and she had been drawn into a quarrel before she even knew what it was about . Anything could start it , a word spoken in the wrong tone of voice or a glance of contempt , and in an instant her parents would be at each other 's throats and the abyss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them when her father first came in , their voices graduallygrowing more bitter and more loud as the restraints dropped away , and the quarrel , like some untrustworthy animal , had got out of control . She heard the familiar warnings they wasted on each other and the insults and loud cries of anger , before they started accusing each other of extravagance and deceit . In the kitchen , she knew , the maid would be listeningin excitement , and the next time they passed the girl would give her a poisoned , embarrassed , understanding glance , a kind of gloating hidden in the uncertain expression on her face . She could not stand it . It was nothing new but she could not harden herself to expect it , and her shame for them and her fear of the ridicule or amusement she thought she saw in the eyes of her friends was too much for her . When she sensed the danger of these outbreaks she tried to get away and to see to it that none of her friends visited the house , for she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when other people were around . A long time ago when they had lived in another part of town she had learned how these quarrelsgrew , how they would begin with a single word or a glance , how that drew an answer and then another , until at last she thought of her parents as periodically being caught up in somep120huge mechanical device that carried them through the same cycle of screaming at each other , the same tense and broken cries of humiliation , the same slamming of doors , tears , her father leaving the house and her mother coming to her , holding her in her arms and sobbing her vindictive endearments .... She knew all this by heart . Once in her childhood one of the girls she played with had said , " Your mother and father do n't get along . " Even then she had known that this was an echo of something someone else had said , and that if she heard this much , it meant there was a great deal that she did not hear . She learned to protect herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common mystery of her family ; then she learned to be casual and indifferentand to make fun of their squabbling . But even so her girlhood was marked in her memory by these gross landmarks : a period when her father had disappeared for a week and had come back morose and unyielding ; a time when something had been delivered at the house and there was not enough money to pay for it and her mother , in a rage , had thrown the package out into the yard . She remembered the yellow grass , the box breaking open , and countless scenes of torment stretching back into her memory like ugly monuments , such as are put up after battles , to commemorate shamefulhappenings . She looked down at the city , tasting the smoky air , still weak and shaken after flying at them both , hoping that the boy who was coming for her would get there before the brief peace was broken . She had not known why they fought , except that she was sure it was about money and about her father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something her mother had said and then about all their quarrels , one after another , to the beginning . She heard their voices growing more urgent and upset while she finished dressing , and she went downstairs , calmly at first , to call her boy andtell him that she would meet him somewhere else . They stopped while she phoned . Her mother had been saying mysteriously , " It will be a long time before you 'll have a chance to humiliate me again ! " and her father had been sitting on the davenport , his face flushed and coarse , when she came into the room . From the expression on her face , from some look of contempt , her mother had guessed that she was going to let them see how she felt ; she had turned on Rose suspiciously and she had looked hurt when Rose answeredher question by saying that she was going to call Roger and tell him she would meet him at his house . She had thought briefly of the girl listening in the kitchen , storing up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloat over in secret . They had been silenced for a moment , not too far gone to see the reproach in her phoning , until she called Roger and learned that he was out . Then she thought she saw a dull malicious triumph on their features , and when her mother said innocently , " I thought you said he was coming here , " she slammed the receiver back on its hook . " It does n't matter , " she replied . " I just thought I 'd save him coming here . " She started out to the front of the house , and her father said for her benefit , after a period of silence , " I got the garage bill . It was a hundred and twenty dollars . " She knew why he had said it , for if her mother was triumphantabout his thoughtlessness or unreliability , he could answer her by charging her with extravagance , so that when he lost and she had succeeded in making him feel his guilt he would try to force the argument back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother saw it too and flared up , " And is that why you 've kept me waiting ! " Then as she went outside , to watch the first skyrockets bombarding the sky , she heard them beginning again as heatedly as if they had not been interrupted . It was his story that his debts and the moneyP122they spent and his overwork excused whatever he did , and hers that he begrudged her the simplest necessities . She heard him saying monotonously , " I do n't know about that . But I do know we 've got to cut down and we 've got to retrench and we 've got to stop throwing money right and left and I ca n't put out a hundred and twenty dollars every few weeks on that car . They 're doing it at the mill and we 've got to do it here . " She was stirred at the dull conviction in his voice . She walked out into the yard where the lawn sprinkler was beating lightly on the grass and though she could no longer hear them she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her mother moving heavily back and forth , the beads on her dress making a faint gravel sound when she moved , straightening a rug by moving it with her foot , pausing to move an ashtray back where there would be no danger of its falling , and her father watching her sternly , the flush on his cheeks emphasizing the gray decaying pouches under his eyes . She could no longer hear them but the knowledge that they were still fighting made her restless , and Roger 's being late wore on her nerves . When she went back her mother said bitterly , " You 've reminded me of it enough ! " and she knew that they had reached the stage when they were going back over the old fights , digging up the sore points in them . She sat down quietly , paying no attention to either of them , sitting down and waiting nervously until her mother asked , " Is n't Roger coming for you ? " She said " Yes , " and the three of them eyed one another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , closing the back door softly , and walked down the lighted driveway , her head turned away from the house . Her father said abruptly , " And if you knew how things stood there would n't be any more talk of going to the mountains . " They raged at each other for a few minutes , until she looked up and tried to make the distaste clear on her features : " I ca n't blame him for not wanting to get here early . " P123He turned on her . " By God , Rose , I 'm telling you the truth ! I 've got a letter from Digby right here ! " He waved the piece of paper , conscious of the effect Digby 's name had on them . " I mean what I say ! " he cried . " I 'm borrowed up on everything I own . The mill wo n't be running this winter if things do n't pick up . " Then he began reciting details to them , mentioning interest and stock he had put up with the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them and knowing that it increased his stature in their eyes to rattle them off so fluently . " We 're running on export orders now , " he said . " And we lose on every foot of stock we ship . We 've got to cut down and we got to begin doing it and I 'm in earnest ! I 'm in earnest ! If we shut down this winter and the bank calls in my loan I wo n't own a share of stock in that plant . Now you think that over . " She said impatiently , " I know it and have I said anything ? Have I complained ? But you do n't have to tell the neighbors and you could at least wait till Roger and I leave . " " You keep out of this , " he said . " You just told me you wanted me to listen ! " " If I ca n't talk over business affairs with my own wife in my own house , " he said , " without having to wait on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name . . . . " Her mother said , " Charles , you 've no reason to take that attitude . " He warned them , " I 'm fed up with it . " " I 'm fed up with it too . " She started to speak but he turned to her again . " You keep out of this . This does n't concern you . " Her mother said sharply , " Charles ! There 's no excuse . . . " " Ah , Christ , " he said in disgust . He lit his cigar , his hand trembling with irritation . " If you only knew , " he began , and she knew that he was going to say again if they only knew what he really thought . " You 've no right to talk to us that way , " her mother said , P124and she looked at her mother , at the large features now frozen into what her mother thought was calm dignity , the headed dress that draped on her elegantly and made her look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him alone , " she said impatiently . " You know when he 's like this . . . . " Now I 've said it , she thought . " Rose , I 've given you everything you ever asked for , " he said . The skyrockets began to rise toward the smoke , one after the other , mounting from some hidden pit behind a rise on the hill and climbing toward the sky in a rush of fire . The hills turned gray and green and the unearthly light revealed the roofs of the houses . There was a faint hush ! prolonged after the silent explosion , and then the noise of the explosion . I should n't have said that , she thought , remembering her outraged fury when he said I 've given you everything you ever asked for , and the discomfortand guilt she felt as she did not reply . Oh , have you ? she had thought , bitter and remorseful , thinking , Everything but what I wanted , while he spoke of ingratitude and having his own daughter ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes lifting his voice in anger against her . Then he had gone upstairs , but there was no end to it , for when she had gone outside to get away from them her mother had waited sorrowfully in the front room , large , poised , noble , never conscious of how ridiculous her pose of noble suffering made her seem . She waited . Roger was half an hour late but there was not enough life left in her to be angry ; she listened to the rustle of the water from the sprinkler on the grass and watched the stray skyrockets dart like huge , lighted insects across the sky , her eyes dilated from crying . When they first began , when the first colored bubbles had begun to float down to earth , she had called to her mother to come watch them , mostly to show that she was sorry for the way she had acted and now wanted to make up . But her mother had moved around with her intolerable sweet/suffering dignity , getting up slowly from the heavy chair and crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint gravel sound as she moved . Large , silent and poised , she had stood in the doorway for a few moments , smiling mistily at the broad darkness below the hill , until Rose had thought , Be a companion to your daughter , and her mother had said , with a quiet , **35;2378;TOOLONG inflection in her voice , " Have they started ? " Was it any wonder ? The wonderful ginger-ale bubbles had risen and faded ; the hills had mildewed green , disappeared , and she had suffered with her mother 's affectations . " Is n't it pretty ? " her mother had said , and she had answered silently , Is n't it ? Out on the harbor the searchlights from the destroyers crossed the sky , focused on the yellow clouds of smoke . Another rocket lifted ; another , another . She looked at her mother , wanting to make up , but her mother looked so sad and so spiritual she could not say it . I 'll never learn , she had thought . I always fall for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and look . " Beautiful , " her mother had said softly . Was it any wonder ? She bared her teeth at the darkness . " Has he shut up ? " she had asked . She remembered her mother stiffening at her tone , glancing at her reproachfully , deciding not to speak , while her features melted slowly to suffering womanhood . " No , " she had confessed , and the beads on her dress had jingled musically as she sighed . He had yelled down from upstairs , " I said I did n't know ! I told you before I did n't know ! " the words floating off into the windless dark . " Oh , dear , " her mother had murmured , and touched her hand lightly to her forehead . Slowly she turned toward the interior of the house and stepped inside with heavy grace . " Charles ? " she called gently . A slobber of questions trickled downstairs from behind the closed doors.  |p126Patient  womanhood , her mother called back , " Did you call me , Charles ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness . Oh , God , I ca n't stand this . She heard the dim rumble of his words and saw her mother , self-sacrificing patience , standing in the middle of the room under the light , her head tipped sideways to catch his words , her hand pressing over her heart , the sparkles glinting from her long black beaded dress and her face almost as round , almost as bright , almost as expressionless as an electric-light bulb . " If I 'd known I would have told you ! " he had shouted . " I simply did n't know ! " " All right , Charles " her mother had said wearily , " let 's do n't say any more about it . " " What ? " " Let 's do n't say any more about it . " " 1 did n't say anything about it ! That 's a lie . " She had winced at his voice , rasping like a file on her nerves . " I did n't say anything about it and I do n't intend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know I had to go ! " Her mother had cried out , " I said , let 's do n't say any more about it ! " In the front room her mother had smiled mournfullyand nervously and put her hand with an aspirin gesture to her forehead , saying , " Very well , Charles , very well , " and then she could not stand it any more . " Let him alone , " she had cried . " Ca n't you see ? Have n't you any sense ? " Her mother had looked at her blindly and turned on her you-too ! expression , mouth twisting at life 's bitter irony , until she had stammered , " You do n't have to look so stepped-on . " Then she had wanted to say , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry I said it , you do n't have to tell me , but her mother had looked at her with her eyes hurt . " I think I 've been humiliated enough , Rose , " she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had tried to say , I 'm sorry , but no words came . Then they heard him stamping around upstairs , and all at once her mother was no longer affected and annoying , but only a fat and ugly oldp127woman , bewildered and disappointed and lost , and she had cried out without knowing what she was saying , " Oh , you make me sick ! You mope and yell at each other and I sit here and think I 'll go crazy and you go on and on and on and on and I ca n't stand it ! Nobody can stand it ! I do n't see why I have to listen  --  why you ca n't let up on it  --  why you ca n't . " She had felt the tears begin pumping up through her and her mother 's figure suddenly began dissolving , rain on chalk , and the room ran together in the candlelight . " Now , Rose , " her mother had said in her mv-poor-little-girl , **27;2415;TOOLONG and the fat arm went around her and she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulb face . " Rose ! " her father had called . " See what your mother wants ! " and " There , " her mother had said . " My poor baby . " She had pulled herself free and stepped back out on the porch , composing herself in the semi-darkness . She had heard her mother coming after her and had gone down the steps to the lawn . The sprinkler was still turned on and she had heard the needle streams and the wash of water on the grass . " Rose ! " her mother had said anxiously , and controlling her tears she had thought , Tell the neighbors . Then he had yelled down again and her mother had started upstairs . Now she 'll tell him , she had thought . Now she 'll give him hell . It was a few moments before Roger came up the walk , his white shirt front shining in the reflected light , his flat straw hat thrust far back on his head . At the far edge of the light he stooped down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fly to see if his pants were buttoned , pulled down his coat smartly , touched his hat , and stepped up on the sidewalk . " Here I am , " she said . He turned quickly , a smile on his face , and walked across the lawn toward her , removing his hat and transferring it from hisp128right hand to his left as he came near . " Well , sweetheart ! " he said lightly . " What are you doing out here ? " " If you want to know , " she said , " I was moving the sprink-ler . " " Ha , ha ! " he said . " Moving the sprinkler ! " " Well , I was . " He threw back his head and laughed . " You moving the sprinkler ! " he cried . She stared at him . " You have to , " she said . " If it stays in one place it washes up the grass . " " No ! " he cried playfully . " You do n't mean it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What a joke ! His head went back , the dental smile spread , the straw hat waved . " Well , " she said , after a moment , " you broke your neck to get here . " " What a mob ! " he replied obliquely . " You ought to see it . All over the streets . And the sailors . " " What are you trying to do ? " she asked . " Teach me a lesson ? " " What do you mean ? I 'm not late . You did n't say . " " Oh , did n't I ? I 'm sorry , " she said . " I thought I did . " " Well , you did n't . " You liar , she said silently . They looked toward the house . The orange light from the front windows spread out over the lawn . She could see the shadow as her mother moved inside , and she thought wearily : Now I hope they stay quiet . Now if they 'll only stay quiet . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . It must be . He was worried ; he swung his straw hat in a nervous embarrassed manner , the smile staying on his face like somethingleft over from some other mood , and ran his free hand over the shining lapels of his dinner jacket . " Well ? " he asked . She looked away , hiding the expression on her face by lookinghard at the lighted tower of the Past Bay National , where your money works for you.  | " Well , what ? " " Well , " he said , " did you ? " " No . " The smile stayed on his face . Like a scar . The life went out of it and it stayed on the front of his face . She pulled off a piece of the cedar hedge and chewed on it . " No , " she repeated . " But why 'd you ask ? " " Nothing , " he smiled . " Just neighborly . " " It 's nice of you , " she said . " Nice of you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't worry . You 'll be all right . " The dumb smile never moved . Over town , the skyrockets . She watched his face while he followed one in its rise . " No , " she said . Then she added , " Worry 's the worst thing you could do . " He winced . The smile began to sag a little . I 'll get it , she said to the hedge . She could feel her lip drawing back from her teeth . " The very worst , " she repeated in a my-goodness voice . " Did you talk to Madge ? " " Yes . " " What did she say ? " " She said not to worry . " " Ah , Kit , " he said . " Listen . " A car came up the drive . They watched it swing around the hairpin curve and slide past with a low steady hum on the far side of the hedge . He looked at her helplessly and she weakened , but then she could see him beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind his nice teeth and his dumb smile and No , she thought , I wo n't help you . " I 'm listening , " she said . " Why you sore ? Because I 'm late ? I did n't think . You did n't say . I thought it was all right . When you phoned . It just makes it worse when you act like this . "  |p130He  stood before her , begging for peace of mind , a word of relief , a crumb of comfort . Helpless without his smile . He must love it , she thought , and she thought of his smile as a toy she had taken away from him , and he would cry until he got it back . " You knew so much , " she murmured . " You knew so much . And then you said Madge knew so much . I even know more than she does . I at least know what ergot is . " " What did she say ? " She felt a rising disgust . " She was tickled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all over town by now . " He said , miserably , " No . What did she really say ? " " She was . I could see . She could n't wait . She asked me and asked me and asked me . Then I drove her on home and she said she 'd find out this woman 's name and ask Madie and try to think what that girl who was staying with the Murphys did . " He sighed again . " What about Harry ? " he asked . " What 'd she say ? " The smile was all gone now and he was not asking for it back . He stood looking miserably at the house , at the water from the sprinkler glinting faintly , his face humble and relaxed . " She said Harry took care of it . " Then she weakened and moved over toward him . " You know something , " she said . " They must not do very much because when I said , when I asked her what they did she looked so dumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dumb because she did n't want to tell me what they did , but I asked her and she really is dumb . So I said , Well does he ? and she looked so bewildered I knew she never heard of it and her eyes popped out of her head . What can they do ? " He looked absorbed and puzzled , glancing at her with a faint awakening interest crowding out his worry . " She did ? " Then he said , " That 's funny . " " How could he ? "  |p131He  grinned . " I guess you could , if you had lots of self-control . " She thought about it for a few moments , thinking what he did and wondering how anybody . " Golly , " she said . " I do n't see how that could be very much fun . " " Neither do I. " She took his arm and pressed it . " Something else she said , " she began . He said in a low voice , " Jesus , you know something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No wonder he looks so all in . " " Would it be ? " " It 'd kill me . " She was awed . " Because when you , " she said . " Yeah . " They walked slowly toward the graveled driveway . She held his arm and watched the grass to keep her slippers out of any place where the water from the sprinkler had drained . She laughed abruptly and squeezed his arm . " You know something ? " she whispered . " I 've been thinking all afternoon . What will he think when she asks him ? Because I know she will . And what will he tell her ? Because he 'll feel like a perfect fool unless he 's as dumb as she is . " They stepped into the light from the porch . His eyes glistened ; there was an amused superior smile on his lips ; he held himself proudly conscious of her hand on his arm . " Hah ! " he exclaimed . She motioned toward the house . " Let 's go . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Mad ? " " No . " She whispered hurriedly , " He was supposed to take mother some place for dinner and he did n't come and did n't come and she got hysterical and then he came home drunk  --  he said he had to go out with the officers from the destroyers  --  he 's on a welcoming committee and then they started to fight and I 'm a fool , I got mixed up in it . "  |p132He  kissed her . " I love you , " she said . " It 's wrong for you to make me stay here when you know it 's such hell . " He kissedher again and caressed her for a few moments before he replied . " I did n't know . You did n't tell me when I phoned . " They stepped into the shadows at the edge of the driveway and he kissed her more ardently . She heard the faint rustle ofthe lawn sprinkler and when she opened her eyes she saw astar suddenly burst overhead , swell into a blue globe as largeas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt alive andhot as she closed her eyes while the blue and yellow lightsfloated softly through the air . She pushed his hand away . " Come on , " she said briskly . " Let 's go . " Her father came out on the porch . " Rose , " he said . " Rose . " " What ? " " Rose . " His large figure blocked the doorway , sending out a wide and wavering shadow over the lawn . His evening clothes looked wrinkled . " What is it , papa ? " " Have you gone ? " " No , we 're still here . " He peered nearsightedly into the shadow below the porch . " I wanted to tell you , " he began . They moved into the light . Oh , Lord , she thought . Now all this over again . " Oh , hello , Claude ! " he said . " This is Roger , Papa . " " Oh , yes ! Excuse me , Roger . I thought for a minute you were Claude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Mr. MacMahon ? " His dental smile was fast asleep on his face . " Fine weather , is n't it ? " " I 'm fine , thank you , Roger . As well as I can expect , I guess . " His voice was sad ; now he 's going to be sorry , shep133thought unhappily , and looked at him ; he had been crying ; the pouches under his eyes were gray-colored and decayed . " Do n't let me keep you . I just wanted to say .... " She said coldly , " We were just leaving . We 're late now . " He heard the coldness in her voice and glanced toward her , a fixed , glassy , appealing smile on his face . I 'm sorry , his body said . Ca n't you see that ? He swayed slightly in the doorway , and once his large body gave a sudden jerk as he belched inaudibly . There were huge beads of sweat on his forehead . " Kitten , I 've got to take the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes . " " Where are you going ? " " Well , I 've got to run down to the plant for a while , they 're having a little trouble down there . I 've got to run down and see what 's wrong . I do n't expect I 'll be gone more than a minute ; they called me up a few minutes ago ; the lights went off and they 're having trouble generally , so I thought I 'd better take a run down there and see if I ca n't get things straightened out . " There was another silence . Her father made no move to leave . " You promised me the car , " she said . " Well , I know , Kitty , and you can have it the minute I get back . I wo n't be but half an hour , I do n't imagine , if that long  --  probably not that long , certainly no longer . And the minute I get back you can have it , I 'll be through with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rose repeated bitterly . " But Kitten , " he said . He stomped over to her and put his hand on her head . " How could I know this was coming up ? Now how could I ? " He smiled at her and then glanced up and smiled at Roger , shaking his head as if they had some secret understanding between them . Roger smiled . " Oh , I do n't suppose it matters , " she said . " Nothing I want to do matters . If it was n't this it would be something else . " He looked appealingly at Roger . " Now , Rose . I told youp134you could have the car when I got back . Ca n't you take a cab if you 're in a hurry ? I 'll be back in a few minutes . " " Why do you have to go ? You never have to go . Ca n't somebody else go ? " " There 's nobody in town , Kitten . Walker 's on his vacation and everybody else is away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ca n't we just drive you down and leave you ? " " How would I get back ? " " Could n't one of the men bring you back ? " " They 're busy . They would n't be working at all tonight if they were n't busy . " Her mother came out on the porch . " What is it , dear ? " she asked before she reached the door , moving with loud and stately poise as her beaded dress rattled when she walked . " Is something the matter ? Oh , hello , Roger ! How are you ? " " Fine , Mrs. MacMahon , thank you . I 'm fine ! " he replied , the smile spreading like a bruise . He leaned forward with a salesman 's joviality when she held out her hand . " Sit down ! " her mother cried . " Why are we all standing here ? Sit down ! Is n't it lovely ? " she asked Roger . " Is n't it ! " he cried in turn . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 've been watching them all evening ! " " Have you ? " he cried in delight . " Oh , I love them , " her mother said . " I 've always loved fireworks . I 've always been crazy about them . When Mr. MacMahonand I were in San Francisco one Chinese New Year . " She heard it , watching to see if they were going to be nice , afraid of something happening . She said , " We 'll go down and wait for you . There 's no need to wait here . " Her mother looked at her . " Come on , Roger . " " Where are you going , Rose ? " " We 've got to take papa to the mill . " " I thought you were going to wait till he gets back . "  | " No , maybe he 'll be a long time and if he finds out he 'll bea long time we 'll leave him and come back for him . " " Oh , very well . " Alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacMahon ! Good-night ! " " Good-night , Roger . " So sweet ! She walked ahead of them to the car . Her father 's heavy steps on the walk . Hell , she said silently , hell . I never get to do what I want . She jerked the door open viciously , hearing him . I suppose you run into trouble like this all the time . Well , yes , in a way , yes . In another way , no . I will say in the main we 've got a smooth organization , seldom any trouble . Even tonight it only happens that Walker , my superintendent , he 's away , or I would n't be bothered . Oh , God , she thought . How can he keep it up ? She drove up beside the office and switched off the lights . Two men approached them from the shadows . In the weak , indirect lighting of the dash she saw one of them looking like a detective , carrying a flashlight in his hand . The other moved about uneasily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacMahon began . " Been having trouble ? " Carl came up and leaned on the door of the car . " Nothing very serious , Charlie , " he said . " The lights went out , and I thought I better let you know about it . I would have called Walker , but I remembered he was out of town , so I figured I better call you . . . . It 's nothing very serious , but what I was wondering is , I wondered if it would n't be better to blow the whistle and send them home . You see , somebody broke in the office  --  I have n't found anything was taken , but they been raising hell in there ever since the lights went out , running around and yelling , you know . They did n't want to work tonight , so they been raising the devil . " There was a glow of red light from one building , barely visible , but the huge factory itself was dark and silent . The hot smell reached even here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking as if it were balanced there ; a network of tubes and pipes rising above one end of the factory ; vague plumes of steam . " How long have they been off ? " " Ten , fifteen minutes  --  just before I called you . " " You found out what 's wrong ? " " Well , yes , " Carl said . " That is , in a way . I 'll tell you what I did  --  I had Hagen check through the factory , to see where the trouble was , and it ai n't in the factory . Of that we 're sure . Then you see I had to send somebody to watch the heat  --  I had to take care of that , too , so the sprinklers would n't blow . That 's all taken care of . " She moved restlessly . " Oh , excuse me ! " MacMahon said . " You know my daughter , Carl . Rose , this is Mr. Belcher . " She smiled at him . " And this is Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust his hand in front of MacMahon . " Glad to know you , Hanson ! " he said cordially . As they shook hands , Roger murmured , " Schwartz . " " What was that ? " " I say Schwartz . " Carl nodded , looking somewhat puzzled . " Yes , " he said . There was a slight , embarrassed silence . " Well , let 's get down to business ! " MacMahon said . " They been out now , fifteen , twenty minutes , you say ? Is that right ? You do n't know what the trouble is . " " No . We know it ai n't in the factory . " " Did you call the power house ? " " Well , yes , in a way , that is . I had Morley call the power house ; you see , I had to hurry around in there before I found a light , and I nearly broke my leg  --  I tripped over some stuff in there and cut a terrible gash in my leg , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . I was going to call the power house as a matter of fact when I found they had broken into the office , so I thought I better call you . "  | " Did they take anything ? " " Well , no , not so far as I could tell . I only had this one flashlightand I had to get some iodine for my leg . I was afraid it would fester . " " Hum , " her father said , " what do you know about that . " " I thought you ought to know . " " That 's the limit . " " They 're worked up about the cut . I hear them complain . " " Hum , " her father said , " that 's the limit . " " I thought I ought to tell you before I decided . " They waited . She stared at the dashboard , thinking over the disappointments that had piled up uncontrollably and the slow steady drain of everything she ever looked forward to , and looked up to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impotence on his pear-shaped face , and really saw him for the first time , stocky and stupid-looking , a kind of brutalitymarked on his heavy jaws and a kind of animal cunning in his eyes . She was quickened with a moment of vague fear , remembering what her father had said earlier in the night and other warnings he had made before , remembering all the excitementwhen Carl had first come to the factory and remembering that he came from the Eastern office where Digby sent out his orders . Roger sat back , bored and polite , and her father looked troubled , as though he were making an effort to remembersomething . The little man moved in and out of the shadow . Beyond them the dormant factory sent out its waves of heat and she looked up at it , trying to read through the technical phrases they used . " There was that export to finish , " Carl said softly . " You said to get it out if we worked all night . " She heard the antagonism in his voice , and knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said vaguely . Then he sighed . " More trouble . You never know when it 's going to get you , do you , Carl ? "  | " No , you sure do n't , Charlie , not in this business you do n't , " his voice smooth and friendly . She said , " Hurry , papa . We do n't want to be here all night . " " Now , just a minute , Kitten . Just a minute . " He turned to Carl again . " You do n't know how long they 'll be off ? " No , we do n't . " " Hum , I suppose the thing to do is send them home . But I hate to send them home , and then have the lights come on five minutes later . " " That 's what I thought . " " Yes , I hate to do that . . . . You 're sure it 's not in the factory ? " " No . " She could see the contempt he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . As though conscious of his sharpness , Carl went on , " We checked it through  --  I told Hagen to check it through . You ca n't depend on him but it 's all I could do . " Her father eased himself out of the car . " I guess I better look things over before I decide , " he said . " I 'll only be gone a minute . " As he walked away with Carl and Morley she slumped back in the seat . Beside her Roger stared after them with a childlike inquisitiveness , impressed , she could see , with the way they had consulted her father . She too felt a little pride , but she only said , " They bore me stiff when they get started that way . They never stop . " They lit cigarettes and looked out over the town where things were happening , where people were dancing in the hotels and where the drunken sailors would be staggering through the streets , the firecrackersclattering and the skyrockets rushing toward the clouds . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadly . " Jabber , jabber , jabber , it 's all they do . " He nodded , running his finger gently under his stiff collar where it pressed against the tender flesh of his neck.  | IT happened almost as soon as they went into the factory , and it was over in an instant ; there was a moment of confusion , a brief struggle , and then someone hit him and then he was standing alone in the singing darkness wondering what had happened and who had hit him . He had been telling MacMahonabout having Frankie Dwyer watch the sprinklers , and Morley had been tagging along behind , when all at once he heard them shouting , There he is ! There he is ! and from all parts of the darkness they bore down on him . " My God , " he heard MacMahon say , and then there was a wild stirring in the , darkness and before he could lift the light a man came running up to him , almost colliding with them before he stopped . In a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man 's face ; he could see the sweat and dirt on his cheeks , his eyes wide open and almost protruding from their sockets . He was panting so hard that the words broke from him between gasps for breath . Carl backed away in alarm and the man crowded up to him . " Hurt ! " the man shouted . " We need the light ! " He backed away , holding his arm up to ward the man off  --  Wait ! he said , wait ! " The hoist man ! " the man said . " He 's hurt ! " Then he shouted rapidly and the men crowded around . " What 's the trouble here , " MacMahon said , " what 's the trouble ? " But the man grabbed the flashlight and Carl pulled it free . Let go of that ! There was a brief , confused struggle . Carl turned sideways and the man tugged at his arm . " He 's hurt , " the man said . Carl pulled away , swinging his elbow back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of breath . The man dropped back . Then he grabbed the light again . They stood rigid , the light directed against the floor , a round yellow pool covering their shoes and making a little circle around them . Then it began to waver across the floor , darting like a fish under water . Carl felt the flashlight slipping from his hands . He cut back again with his elbow . Then he got up slowly and watched the light go bouncing across the factory . It bounced like a tennis ball , touching the floor and then the piles of doors , leapingup to the roof and dropping back to the floor again . Then it disappeared . His mouth was bleeding . He could taste the blood and feel it drying on the back of his hand . He groped through his pockets for a handkerchief , pressing it softly against his tender mouth . His mouth felt swollen . Standing there with the darknesssinging around him , he wanted to wash his face . He could think of the clean white enamel basin with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine dipping a wash rag into the water and pressing it against his mouth . He could think of all the details of filling the basin , down to turningthe tap and putting the stopper in place , and hearing the changing sounds the water made as it grew deeper . In a dim incredulity he heard Morley asking , " What did you want me to do ? " What ? " You said for me to do something . " He took the handkerchief away from his mouth and shook his head . His head was clearing . He found the pile of doors behind him , and sagged against it . The muscles in his back relaxed . " Yes , " he said . He felt Morley 's hand tugging at his upper arm . " I guess you 're right , " MacMahon was saying . " Things seem to be upset . I suppose you better let them go home . " The darkness was intense . He could hear Morley 's breathingand MacMahon 's vague mumbling a short distance away.  |p141A  voice asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better ? " Yes , he said silently . I feel all right . " Yes , " MacMahon was saying . " I imagine it 's the only sensible thing to do . Send them home . No use making a lot of trouble . " His head was clearing . He tried to think over what had happened . This fellow had come running up to him . Give me that flashlight . Why ? Never mind why . Then the man swung on him . Grabbed the flashlight and hit him in the face with it . Before he had a chance . He asked Morley , " Who was that ? " " What ? " " That fellow , " Carl said . " Fellow I gave the light to . Was here a minute ago . " He was surprised to find that he spoke in a low mumble and that his mouth hurt when he talked . Morley replied surprisingly . " He said the hoist man , " Morley said . " He said the hoist man was hurt . " MacMahon began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the piles of doors . He cleared his throat , making a hack , hack sound , several times in succession . " Warm in here , " MacMahon announced . Leaning against a pile of doors , Carl felt that his head was clearing . I made a pass at him , he said silently . If it had connected . Then this other fellow came up behind me . Grabbed me from behind . I made a quick swing . " About ten-thirty , " Morley said . " That is , I ca n't say exactly , but I judge it must be about ten-thirty . Maybe not that late . Maybe a little later . " I did n't have a chance , he said silently . No sooner had I swung . Then he brought the flashlight down . Hit below the belt . I ducked . Wonder it did n't kill me . MacMahon moved over closer to him . " What was that ? " Carl said painfully , " I say he outweighed me . " There was a long silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl 's shoulder ; he released it when Carl straightened up . " Well , " MacMahon said , " everything seems to be settled down . You might as well blow the whistle and send them home , I expect . . . . No use having a lot of trouble . " No one answered him . " Well , " MacMahon said , " I guess I 'll be running along , everything seems to be settling down now . I 've got my daughter out in the car out there , and I hate to keep her ; she 's going somewhere , due there now , I expect . I guess you can take care of it all right now , Carl  --  everything seems to be straightened out , and you blow the whistle and send them home and I do n't expect you 'll have any more trouble . " " Blow the whistle , " Carl said . " Yes , it 's the sensible thing to do , I imagine . Everybody seems to be sort of upset , might as well send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements along the pile of doors . " About that fellow , " he began . " You ought to look into that . If anybody 's hurt . Morley , you better come with me . I ca n't remember how we came in . " Carl said heavily , " I was thinking it might be better for Morley to go tell Mike to blow the whistle . " " Yes , " MacMahon replied . " Come on , Morley . " They moved a little . His head cleared . " Wait , " he said . " I might just as well go with you . No use separating . I probablyca n't find him anyway . " There was another silence . MacMahon was edging slowly away . " We can get out all right , Carl , " MacMahon said . " Well , wait , Mac , " Carl said . " Wait . Listen . " " What good does that do ? " " Wait . Listen . " MacMahon was getting accustomed to moving through the darkness . He spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All right , all right ! I can find my way ! Everythingp143seems to be straightened out now ! You two ought to be able to take care of it ! " " Mac , " Carl said . They listened while MacMahon shuffled down the alley . They could hear him panting and blowing as he edged along the pile of doors . Carl ran his fingers over his bruised face . You son of a bitch , he kept thinking . You God-damned yellow bastard . As he touched his swollen lip a hot rise of anger curdled through him , but at the same time he felt a kind of uneasiness that was all mixed up with the thought of himself lying on the floor and watching the light go bouncing across the factory . " You might at least have seen who it was , " he whispered bitterly . " I ca n't do everything . " " He wanted you to blow the whistle , " Morley suggested . " A lot of good it did , getting him down here . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stockroom was very quiet ; they could no longer hear MacMahon . " If I was running this place , " Carl said thickly , " things would be different . . . . I 'm going back to the office , " he said painfully . " I got to call the power house . I should have called them before . Go around and tell them to punch out . Tell Mike to blow the whistle . " Morley moved about indecisively . " Tell Mike , " he said . " Tell them to punch out . " " You heard him , did n't you ? You heard what he said , did n't you ? Ca n't you hear ? " Morley said hastily , " Oh , yes , yes , " but Carl 's outburst died away immediately . " Made us come out tonight , " he said bitterly . " Then look . He did n't know what we were working on . " He thought with a sort of weary pleasure of getting back to the office and of going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , " he said shortly . " Get after them . " His brusque , executive voice pleased him a little , and did something to restorehim . He began shuffling down the alley between the pilesp144of doors . He could feel them on both sides of him , and held his hands out before him like a sleepwalker so he would not run into them . Almost immediately Morley disappeared . He had a dim feeling that Morley was glad to get away . Then he stopped shuffling his feet , hearing a little commotion near him . Someone chattered away restlessly . " Oh , what a sock ! Oh , what a blow , what a blow ! Jesus , you should have seen him . He swung like an old woman . Then sock ! Sock ! Sock ! Sock ! " Someone else said , " Shut up . The Old Man 's here . " " I do n't give a damn . What the hell . I did n't do it . " " No , shut up . The old man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the  --  out of the poor old bastard . " There was a brief silence . Then someone jumped up and began dancing around in the darkness , singing with a kind of whispered exultation : " Oh , what a sock , what a sock , what a sock ! Oh , what a sock , what a sock , what a sock ! " Someone started to laugh . " Come on , Nuts , " a voice said . " Let him alone , he 's nuts . " Another voice said sharply , " Shut up ! You want to get booted out of here ? Your card will be gone if you ai n't careful . " They quieted down and he could no longer hear what they were saying . For a moment he had a wild idea of calling to them . But even while he listened he felt tired and almost sick ; when he put his hand on his face he was surprised to find that his lip was thrust out so far from the rest of his face . He thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he thought that in a moment the whistle would blow and there would be no need to tell them . Besides , he wanted to get to the office where he could rest and be alone for a while . He shuffled away silently . By this time , he felt , MacMahon must have left , and there was no chance of running into him . He reached out for the pile of doors , intending to lean againstp145it and get his breath , when he discovered that it had disappeared . He moved slowly toward the place where it should be , but it continued to evade him , and when he turned around , to find the pile on the opposite side , he discovered that this pile had moved too . He gave a sigh of exasperation . For a time he stood motionless , attempting to get his bearings , trying to think back over the way he had come , but there was nothing anywherethat would help him to locate himself . Presently his foot touched a heap of refuse . He sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and small pieces of wood . He sighed with relief . He was very tired ; when he sat down his legs began to tremble in a sort of independentdance that did not disturb the rest of his body at all . It was getting hotter in the stockroom ; the sweat was again streaming down his forehead . Then he became conscious of the extreme stillness ; there was no more shouting and laughing ; everyone must have gone outside . It was so quiet that he could hear the faint hiss of the steam pipes far across the stockroomin the factory . After he had rested for a while he got up slowly and painfullyand continued on his way . He kept sliding his feet and waving his arms before him in circular , side-stroke fashion , partly to avoid running headlong into the piles of doors , or into the posts that held up the roof , and partly because he did not want to miss the wall that would guide him to an outside door . I lc discovered that walking had grown extremely painful . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent up its colors like visible manifestations of the pain he felt . He was moving slowly ahead , waving his arms , when the floor abruptly opened and he dropped , landing on his feet and pitching forward on his knees , five feet below where he had been . For a few moments he was stunned . His hands felt the coarse grains of sawdust and the hard scraps of wood . When he pushed his feet backward they encountered a steel surface . Thep146wind was knocked out of him , and breathing hurt him for a time . One of his arms was skinned  --  he could feel the stinging pain crawling slowly up to his elbow , as if someone were moving a lighted match up his arm . I must have fallen , he thought . At least he knew where he was . The conveyor ran diagonally under the factory , picking up the scraps from the saws and finishingmachines . The scraps were carried to the hog , which ground them into the small chips that were used as fuel . Insteadof going out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned around and had gone back into the factory . It explained why the piles of doors had disappeared . It also explainedwhy he had thought the stockroom was getting hotter . He realized this immediately after he fell , while he was still gasping for breath . As his head cleared , he checked over his bruises . He was still too badly shaken to feel much pain , or to attach much importance to it . He felt of his arms and legs methodically , as though he were someone else who had fallen . Aside from the place where the skin was scraped off his arms , and a shattered feeling that he was badly hurt , he felt no acute pain . But he had grown very tired , and he could imagine no greater comfortthan to lie quietly in the rubbish until the light came on again . The refuse conveyor sloped upward , and was quite deep where he had fallen , so that it would still be beneath the level of the floor at the far end of the factory . Walking up the conveyor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some point where it was only two or three feet beneath the floor . But this would have put him back in the very heart of the factory , and he did not want to go back . He had a dull conviction that if he ever got lost in the middle of the factory he would never get out . He was still lying on his stomach , with his head resting on his good arm . He raised himself stiffly and looked around.  |p147He  had fallen quite near the lower end of the conveyor . He could see a faint glaze of light that he knew must come from under the factory . The factory was built on wooden pilings that supported it several feet above the ground , and the light from the tideflat was reflected under the factory . He got to his feet , feeling sick and dizzy , supporting himself by leaning against the steel wall on the conveyor . A steel shield had been put on the conveyor here , for when the pieces of wood were thrown into the conveyor the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and piled up . He began to move cautiously toward the dim glaze of light . He had a confused feeling that if he could get under the factory he could reach the tideflat and so walk smoothly to the office . He had never been under the factory , but the thought of walkingcarelessly over the broad tideflat , being able to see all around him and not having to shuffle his feet or risk running into anything , was almost overpowering . He lowered himself cautiouslyover the drum at the end of the conveyor , lying flat on his stomach with his hands clutching the conveyor chain . It was still pitch-dark under the factory . He was still holding to the wooden supports of the conveyor , smelling the salt , moist air , so different from the dry heat in the factory , when he felt a curious tickling sensation in his shoes ; it took him a long time to realize that he was standing in water that reached almost to his knees . He moved away as quickly as he could . The heavy , seaweed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk with his legs far apart , balancing himself by swinging his arms widely . It was like trying to run through soft sand . He bumped against a piling and held to it for a moment in relief . Then he moved to drier ground and rested , for wading through the grass had winded him again . It was quiet under the factory except for the splash of water that drained from the kiln . There were complex smells , raw and heavy , like the smells in a swamp : the smell of the heavyp148grass , and the hot water on the mud , the acid smell of the chemicals that had spilled from the place where the doors were glued together . But it was cooler under the factory , and an occasional breath of fresh air came in from the tideflat , washingthe smells away . There was a sudden tremendously loud splashing in the darkness . Startled , Carl made an involuntary run away from it . He thought that something had fallen . But the splashing went on ; there was a powerful thrashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then another loud splash before the silence settled . A voice said in disgust , " Son of a bitch . " Carl did not move . He could hear the man grunting and muttering to himself as he moved about . He breathed loudly ; there was a little wheezing sound when he breathed . A few muttered exclamations broke from him , scraps and syllables of words that seemed to be forced out by his exertions . " Who is it ? " Carl asked . His own voice made him jump . The splashing and wheezing stopped . " How do you get out of here ? " the voice asked . " This God-damned muck . " " Mac ? " Carl said . " Is it you ? " " Yes . Carl ? " " Yes . " " How do I get out of here ? I nearly broke my neck . I must have fell twenty feet . I 'm soaked through . In that crap . Did you fall ? " For a moment Carl hesitated . Then he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the office and I did n't want to go back through the factory . " " Where are you ? " MacMahon called . " Here . " " Where ? Where is that ? " " Here , " Carl repeated . " This way . " " Is it dry there ? I 'm in water up to my knes . God-damnp149filthy stinking stuff it is . . . I been trying to get out of here for an hour . I fell through back over there  --  hit right on my side  --  I think I broke a rib  --  I yelled , nobody heard me . " His voice lifted suddenly , almost in a panic . " Where are you ? " " Here , " Carl said . MacMahon splashed along more rapidly . " Well , wait , " he said irritably . " Wait a minute . " He saved his breath , only grunting and muttering as he worked his way through the water and the weeds . Carl waited , too surprised to say anythingand too bewildered to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bitch , " MacMahon gasped . " Dirty , filthy , stinking water . Got it all over my clothes . " " Did you fall ? " Carl asked . " Fall ? I fell twenty feet . Nearly killed myself . . . I yelled , nobody heard me , I been under here since I left you . Could n't get out , I bumped into things , fell down , son of a bitch , I went around that way , hit a wall , came back around this way , got in water up to my neck , what the hell , why do n't you close up those places in the floor ? I laid there  --  wonder I did n't drown , somebody get killed some day , God-damned carelessness . Wonder I did n't get killed myself , son of a bitch , I was over there , over there , back and forth , half a dozen times . " His voice died away in a sigh of weariness and relief . He was now quite close to Carl ; Carl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wait a minute , " MacMahon said . " Let me get my breath . " He was still dazed , but to hear MacMahon stumbling and panting made him feel less helpless and more composed than he had felt before . MacMahon breathed more easily . He asked , in a subdued voice , " Have they quieted down ? " Carl did not understand him . " Upstairs , " MacMahon repeated . " Have they quieted down ? "  |p150Carl  said painfully , " We got them quiet , yes , they quieted down . " " Somebody pushed me . Just after I left you . . . . Did n't hurt me any . " They became silent again , listening for some stir in the factory . But there was nothing unusual , and they could hear nothing but the dim splash of the water draining from the kiln . " Getting serious , " MacMahon said , " when they act like that . " Carl replied vaguely , " Hagen . He 's back of it . He 's got it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hagen ? " " He 's made trouble before . " " Hagen , " MacMahon repeated . " Good God . " Presently he sighed , " I ca n't believe it . " Carl did not answer him . He remembered Hagen screaming at him , pull my card , if you want to , hysterical , his fat face getting tense , his eyes wild . If you do n't like the way I work , go pull my card . He remembered Hagen screaming at him , hysterical as a woman , in front of the whole crew . It had made Carl nervous ; when he had any trouble he liked to talk things over quietly ; it was no use getting excited , yelling , making a lot of trouble . " Hagen never liked me , " he said slowly . " When I first came here he tried to make trouble . I do n't know why . I did everything I could . He knows more than he lets on ... . God knows I tried to make up with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . Would n't talk to me . " " Yes , " MacMahon said mysteriously . " You 're probably upset . " Then he went on , " Let 's get out of here ; I 'm wet to the skin . How do we get out of here ? " " We may have trouble . I came this way because I thought it was easier than going back through the factory . If we once get to the tideflat , it 's easy . " MacMahon accepted the warning humbly . They started off through the grass and the water . Now and then Carl stumbled in one of the shallow drainage ditches that scarred the ground.  |p151After  he had stumbled , and thrashed about for a time , he would warn MacMahon of the ditch , and a few moments later MacMahonwould stumble in it in turn . The air grew increasingly foul as they approached the place where chemicals had spilled from beneath the glue room . The glue had drained through the floor and down the foundations , covering the ground in a moist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl became agitated for fear that he was heading back under the center of the factory , for the glue room was approximately in the center of the building . Now and then he thought he could catch a faint gleam of light vaguely ahead of him , but it appearedand disappeared so unsteadily he could not tell whether it was light or merely his eyes deceiving him . His arm had begun to sting , and his leg was still bothering him . Behind him MacMahon puffed and groaned , occasionally grunting some brief question , such as , " How far is it ? " or " Why do n't you have this drained under here ? " Sometimes they fell or got tangled in some complex network of the pilings where they were close together to support a heavier piece of machinery . Their arms swinging out before them got tangled in the weeds and sunken crossbeams . But Carl did not hesitate . He did not want MacMahon to think that he did not know where he was going , or to lose confidence in him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's easier than going through the factory . " Brushing aside the damp growth and plowing through the mud and weeds , MacMahon was beginning to have his doubts . " Wait a minute , " MacMahon said . " Let me get my wind . " They stopped . Abruptly Carl discovered that he was standing on dry land . At the same time he thought that the darknesshad grown less intense ; he could see patches of darkness alternating with lighter spaces ; he could see the dim outlines of heavy objects near him . He said , " We 're almost out . I 'm on dry land . " MacMahon floundered through the weeds to join him.  | " Son of a bitch , " MacMahon said . " I 'll never get under here again . " They went into a thick tangle of heavy brush . As the branches slapped back in MacMahon 's face , Carl said , " Must be almost out . The brush only grows around the outside . " MacMahon put his arms over his face , took a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud crashing and stamping . Carl drew back and let him pass . Evidently MacMahonbelieved that he could make a final charge and come out in the open . But the crashing became less and less violent , and MacMahon 's breathing became louder , until at last he sank down in exhaustion . " I 'm played out , " he gasped , almost in relief . " I ca n't go any farther . " Carl worked his way forward more cautiously . When he reached MacMahon he too sank down in a kind of relief . The ground was dry and almost warn . There were a few small trees , alders or willows , in the brush , but they were trapped principally by some kind of spreading bush that grew into a tangle almost as tight as a wire net . The leaves had a bitter , acid smell . The cobwebs struck their faces and felt like the annoying brush of insects . Carl was lying on his side . Suddenly the leaves of a bush a few inches away from his eyes turned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The leaf seemed to come out of the darkness , shine with a gray light until its outlines were plain , and then disappear . " It 's getting lighter , " MacMahon observed . Presently another soft and mysterious glow spread over the bush . While it lasted Carl could see MacMahon lying beside him . " Fireworks , " Carl said . " What ? " " Fireworks . " Carl got to his feet . When he started to walk the water pumped up out of his shoes . MacMahon did not move.  | " You better come on , Charlie , " Carl said unsteadily . " We must be about out now , I guess . " MacMahon mumbled inaudibly in reply . " Come on , Mac . You 'll only catch cold laying here on the ground . " " To hell with it , " MacMahon replied . " I 'm all in . " Carl pushed on by himself . " I 'll see how far it is , " he said . " You come on when you get rested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hear Carl very well and could not make out what he was saying . Carl moved forward slowly . He saved his energy by trying to find the spaces in the brush that gave way most easily . He could not tell exactly when the darkness grew less intense and clear spaces began to show ; he became conscious of fresher air and discovered that it was easier to move forward . When the bushes lighted up he looked overhead and saw that the sky had grown light ; he could even see the interlaced branches over him ; he realized that they had come out from underneath the factory and were lost in the tangle of brush that grew to the edge of the harbor . A moment later he pushed aside a screen of vines and got a glimpse of the water , seeing a single channel light a long way from shore . When he stopped breaking through the brush he could hear the faint wash of the waves against the driftwood that was piled up all along the edges of the bay . He was completelybewildered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light in a curious and baffled hope that he was mistaken , and that it would move or turn out to be the headlight of an automobile coming toward the factory . Then he tried to figure out how they could have got so far from the factory , and tried to remember where the brush grew so high around the foundations . But when he looked back he could see nothing at all ; and when he let the screen of brush drop , the channel light disappeared . Behind him MacMahon began thrashing around and cursing.  |p154Carl  could not hear what he was saying , as the brush crackled too loudly . When he grew quiet Carl called to him . " Mosquitoes , " MacMahon said in reply . " Oh , God damn it , " he said . Carl felt his way back slowly , hunting for the easiest way through the brush . A dreary bewilderment pulled at the musclesin his legs . When a bush slapped him , or a cobweb got in his mouth , he was too disheartened to curse about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm all turned around , " he confessed . " I should judge the factory ought to be over in that direction . " " What direction ? " " That way . I got all turned around somehow . I do n't know . . . I ca n't see , I ca n't figure out which way we came . " MacMahon had pulled his coat up over his head to protect himself from the insects . His voice was indistinct . " We ought to have some sort of an emergency light system , " he murmured . " Be here all night . " Carl did not reply . He was too weary and too confused to do anything but stretch out beside MacMahon and listen to the ringing in his ears . It went on and on , steadier than the shrill scream of the insects that swarmed through the brush . He watched for the occasional skyrockets that lighted the sky to a dull and fading gray . When they flared up the brush becamewatery and translucent . All at once Carl felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start breaking through the brush again . As long as he was lying down he did not have to think about it , and as he rested he closed his mind to the thought that eventually he would have to try again . Stray worries tried to break through this momentary peace like the insects that tried to reach him , but he brushed them off and they flew back as the insects swarmed away when he moved his hand over his face . The whole evening dissolved into a kind of nightmare unreality , with only the sprains and bruisesp155to remind him that it had really happened . He thought of falling over the pile of scrap iron , of trying to put life into the electrician 's son , of pounding some sense into the foreigner , of Hagen screaming at him like a hysterical woman , of watchingthe light go bouncing like a tennis ball across the factory  --  he thought of everything that had happened in a kind of awe at all he had had to do , and with a sort of surprise that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He had been through so much he felt free to lie back and take it easy . " You know that fleet , " MacMahon said suddenly . " That 's a wonderful organization . " His voice was startlingly loud . His words were so far from Carl 's train of thought that Carl merely repeated , " Fleet . " " A wonderful organization . " MacMahon rolled over on his back and put his arms under his head . " I was thinking about it tonight , " he went on dreamily . " It 's a wonderful organization . Those fellows , now , they 've got things down to a system . " Carl propped himself up on his elbow to listen , and brushed the twigs off his face with his free hand . " I had dinner with Captain Nichols , " MacMahon said dreamily . " He was telling me about what they do . Like Captain Nichols , now , he has a launch all to himself and those fellows  --  that run it , I mean  --  they wait right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait till daylight . As soon as they see him , they salute . " " A fine bunch of men , " Carl observed . " A splendid body of men . Finest body of men in the world . . . . " MacMahon suddenly began churning around and slapping at a mosquito that was bothering him . The bushes crackled when he moved . When he grew quiet he went on , " They pay those fellows a dollar a day . Never a murmur . If they kick , they lock them up . " " System . " " Wonderful organization . Nothing like it . " MacMahon'sp156voice lifted with enthusiasm . " When you stop to think , there 's a thousand men in the harbor right this minute . Like Captain Nichols said , if they wanted them , those thousand men would be in their places in half an hour 's time . No excuses ... . That 's the way things ought to be . You say , Do this , ' and by Jesus Christ , they do it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking back , no quitting , not a God-damned thing . " Carl sensed that MacMahon was criticizing him indirectly and that he was comparing the way the men had been acting in the factory and the way they saluted and jumped briskly to their duties in the fleet . This awakened a dormant antagonism in him , for at the very mention of the fleet he had a picture of all the excitement going on in town while he had been tied down in the factory , and when he thought of MacMahon having dinner with the captain he thought again how unfair it was that MacMahon could take things easy while he was breaking his neck running around in the darkness . He stretched out again and looked up through the screen of bushes at the less intense darkness of the sky . Now he could barely see the gaps where the leaves were less thick , and beyond them the faint discolorations of the low clouds . " A dollar a day , " MacMahon was murmuring tranquilly . " Less than that , now , I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls hang around , they get a piece of tail and then they 're satisfied to go back to sea again . . . . Like that salute , now . They show their officers they respect them . Whenever they see them , they salute . " " My wife 's brother was in the Navy , " Carl said . " He was on one of them destroyers in that wreck in California . You know , there was a dozen of them run into a big rock at Honda Point five-six years ago . " " Was he in the wreck ? " " He was drowned . " MacMahon was silent . Presently he sighed , " Accidents hap/pen . Nobody 's perfect . You have to take the good with the bad . . . . Anyway , it was seven . " " I thought it was twelve . " " Seven . " " Jesus , " Carl said . " My wife . . . her brother . " MacMahon was lifted out of his tranquillity . " I do n't give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Captain Nichols tonight  --  he ought to know ! Or maybe you think he do n't know . Maybe you think you know more than he does . " Carl backed down . " I do n't know . I just thought . . . . It seemed to me I remember reading . . . . " " Seven , " MacMahon repeated stubbornly . " Well , seven , then , it do n't make any difference to me . Only like I told my wife at the time , I said , one thing it shows , you have to give them credit , they followed orders . When the first ship went ashore then every God-damned one of them stuck right in line and piled up one on top of the other one . Like I told Grace : it 's an awful tragedy , I said , it 's a real tragedy such as the world has never before seen , but if that is n't proof of wonderful discipline . . . you got to give them credit . Like one of my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from , he said they were going so fast when they began piling up , them destroyers looked like they were trying to screw each other . Like he told me , I remember , afterwards , he said if only the Old Man had run into the coast a few miles north , the way everybody hoped , there would n't have been any drowning , they would have come up on dry land ; they were going so fast , he said , they would have climbed half way up the Sierra Nevada Mountains . " " The way I look at it , " MacMahon said , " nobody 's perfect . " He flattened out and moved his bruised legs in an effort to find a more comfortable place . " I guess you 're right , " Carl replied . The taller bushes made a sort of screen that blotted out the dull sky . When MacMahon moved , then Carl noted that morep158light was let down into the tangle in which they were trapped . The fireworks had become less and less frequent . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some of the stalks over them seemed almost phosphorescent . As Carl listened to MacMahon 's regular breathing the last weak promptings of his worry disappeared . If he does n't care , he thought , why should I ? This was connected in his mind with the picture of MacMahon having dinner with the officers of the fleet while he was bumping into things in the dark factory . He wondered why Morley had not blown the whistle and how he was going to find out who had hit him ; he wondered what was going on in the factory , and if Morley was having any more trouble . But all of these questions were far away , like things he read about in the papers , and they seemed so difficult that he only wanted to free his mind of them . He could hear MacMahon preparing to say something . BeforeMacMahon opened his mouth he shifted his position slightly , straightened his legs , moved his large belly and cleared his throat , and the sounds , usually unnoticeable , now seemed loud and significant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " MacMahon said at last , " we never used to have any trouble like this . " Carl did not reply . " I ca n't remember , " MacMahon went on , " when we ever had as much trouble as we do now . " Presently Carl said stiffly , " You ca n't depend on that light company . " MacMahon twitched and tossed about as his words rose to the surface . " What I was thinking about was that fellah pushed me . Fellah broke in the office . We ca n't have that . Wonder I did n't get killed . Hit right on my side . Gets started , you ca n't tell when it will stop . " " You always have that , " Carl replied , " whenever you got a monply. "  | " What ? " " A monply . " There was another silence . MacMahon asked suspiciously , " What about a monply ? " " The light company . They got a monply . " " What 's that got to do with it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They got you . So they do n't give a damn whether your lights go off or not . Like a monoply , they do n't co-operate . " MacMahon brushed it aside . " I do n't care about that ... . What I was thinking was this fellah . Run right into me . You ought to get people like that out of here . " " I was thinking , " Carl explained painfully , " if they 'd turned on the lights we would n't have had any trouble . But they never give you any satisfaction . I remember last year I had to call them . I could n't get any satisfaction . Maybe if there was competition , maybe they 'd want your business . " All at once MacMahon lurched up on his elbow . He thrashed about unsteadily . Then he cried out in a terrible voice . " What ruined the railroads ? " " What ? " Carl said in surprise . " What . What . " " What ruined the oil business ? What ruined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! What ! " " Well , " Carl began . " Man , " MacMahon said , " you 're crazy . " " Jesus Christ . I ... " " I happen to know ! " MacMahon cried . " God Almighty ! Do n't you think I know ! Do you think the National City Bank is crazy ? " Carl began in a slightly aggrieved voice , " Jesus , all I said wasBut MacMahon interrupted him , " Wait . Do n't say anything . Wait a minute now . " He waited obediently . He heard MacMahon draw a deep breath . A twig worked its way through his clothes andp160scratched his thigh . He moved his toes nervously , feeling the water pumping around inside his shoes . MacMahon asked in a soft voice , almost a whisper , " Do you think the National City Bank is crazy ? Do you think J. P. Morgan 's crazy ? " " No , " Carl replied honestly . " Ha ! All right ! I happen to know the National City has had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's here for ? All right , what for ? I 'll tell you what he 's here for ! " Here MacMahon pounded on the damp soil with his fist . " He 's here because them sons of bitches will not get together ! That 's what he 's here for ! Every time Bassett and Monahan , Superior and John Grigsby Manufacturing , every time they get together what happens ? I 'll tell you what happens ! Some little son of a bitch like the Peabody cuts their throat , or that Jew son of a bitch what 's his name  --  South River L. and S. All right . Now what do you say ? " Carl thought for a time . Then he said , " I do n't see .... " MacMahon broke out in disgust , " You do n't know the first God-damned thing about economics . What ruined the rail-roads ? " " The way I look at it , " Carl replied , " the buses ruined the railroads . " " Ha ! Now we 're getting some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Listen . " Here MacMahon 's voice dropped again , and he became intent and earnest , " What ruined the oil business ? " He did not give Carl an opportunity to reply . The independents , Carl said silently , but MacMahon talked so rapidly he did not have a chance to say it aloud . " I know , " MacMahon was saying . " I was talking to Phipps just the other day . Then there was a piece in the paper . Then some people want that God-damn municipal light and power ! Like I said to Charlie Harris . Who pays the taxes ? He did n't know what to say . Cheaper power ! I said . What in the name of Jesus Christ are you talking about ! You want higher taxes ? youp161God-damn fool , I said ; look , I said , you want a bunch of thievingpoliticians , I said , ca n't even clean the streets ? " Carl could not quite follow this and it made him a little uncomfortable . But he was impressed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked politely . " Say ? What could he say ? He did n't know what to say . " MacMahon seemed to savor the memory of this triumph for some time . He gave a few guttural chuckles and muttered a few indistinguishable words of contempt , even of pity , for his beaten antagonist . But the memory of this triumph led him to speak of other successes and to go into detail about other arguments he had won , and he forgot about his argument with Carl . He began by remembering some of the things he had said to people during the elections , and as he lived back over the ready replies he had made to the stupid questions that had been asked him , his voice grew rich and warm , and his good humor led him to interrupt himself frequently with outbursts of hearty laughter . He relaxed ; he lay on his side again in as comfortable a position as he could find , and when he laughed the shaking of his body made the leaves around him tremble . Carl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confused bitterness prevented his enjoying MacMahon 's reminiscences . MacMahon rumbled on with his warm good humor : " All right , I said . You 're so God-damned broad-minded . How would you like to have your sister marry a nigger ? His face got as red as a God-damned beet . You 're dragging in the race issue , he said . Screw the race issue , I said , I asked you a question . Finally I said , Man , I said , you 're crazy . You Goddamnedfool , I said , if there was n't a tariff on shingles , I said , there would n't be a shingle mill in this state . They can make shingles in British Columbia for less than you pay for your logs . Shingle weavers here have got the industry right by the balls , I said ; they got rates jacked up so high the American manufacturer has n't got the chance of a snowball in hell . Like them Hindus in British Columbia , I said , what do they get ,  |p162five-six  dollars a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it now a thousand ?  --  five-six hours ' work . Look at it this way , I said . Supposing you got a store where you sell your goods for twice as much as you have to pay for them . All right . That 's a favorable balance of trade . Now wait , I said . Supposingyou keep on buying and you do n't sell a damn thing . Think it over , I said . Where the hell would you be ? The worst thing that could have happened to this country , I said , was when Coolidge decided not to run , and anybody with any sense can see it . But be that as it may , I said , it 's no use crying over spilt milk , I said ; no good can come out of choosing as his successor a man committed to I know not what reckless policy of government interference in private business . " MacMahon 's voice trailed away gently , and there were long mumbling sentences that Carl could not hear . Only once in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some argument his adversary had advanced , and these interjections lifted high and clear over the peaceful rumble of his report . What ? he would cry in exaggerated surprise . My God , man , think what you 're saying ! Then the drone of his words would begin again , a familiar and dozing sound , with these notes of excitement growing less and less frequent . Carl listened . He lay flat on his back with his hands under his head . The sweat had dried on his face and the twigs in his hair made his head itch . Occasionally he touched the tips of his fingers very gently to his swollen lip , but the real pain of it had gone away , and now it was not so much pain that he felt as humiliation that his lip stuck out so far from the rest of his face . The brush had a rank , bitter , seaweed smell , cleaner and purer than the smell under the factory , and moist and cool compared with the dust he had breathed inside . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his trouser legs made him feel sloppy and uncomfortable , and even that was not so bad as it had been when he first decided to rest . He relaxed . His eyes closed . He heard MacMahon mutter/ing dreamily . " What this country needs is men with vision . Like nobody wants to go into politics ; we do n't pay our politiciansenough to attract the big men away from business ; like who wants to give up a good income , a good job , to work like a dog , no thanks , nothing but trouble ? Like I read a piece the other day  --  We Kill Our Presidents ' was the name of it  --  this fellah showed how they have to shake hands , you know , talk to Boy Scouts . Take Harding . When I first met him was when we drove through Marion in 1920 ; there he was ; healthiest looking man ; public life . When I saw him again it was when he went to Alaska , just before ; there he was , no better ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former self . Digby knew him well , I met him through Digby , I remember , and Digby told me , I remember , he said he knew of no man who took more seriously his obligations to the public . Like it said in this piece , I remember , a few days before the illness which proved to be fatal , Harding had to get out , even though he was feeling like the morning after the night before , sort of , poor son of a bitch , and greet a delegation of Eskimos came down from Alaska to welcome him to Alaska . Any other man in those circumstances would have said , Screw the Eskimos , but Hardingfelt it was his duty and nothing could deter him , even if he was shaking so he could hardly stand on his own two feet . Inside a month , he was dead . " Here MacMahon 's voice died away entirely . Carl was now breathing rhythmically , and MacMahon was merely talking as he exhaled , and the long snoring sentences did not disturb either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark thicket . The insectsbuzzing around them were almost as loud as MacMahon 's voice . The tide had come in , and the sound of the water washingagainst the driftwood reached them clearly . Now and then a twig snapped , or the dry leaves hissed under an imperceptible breeze . " Dead ! " MacMahon repeated in a mournful voice . " Poor fellah , he never knew what hit him . There he was , still ap164young man , in the prime of his life , you might say , just getting to the point where he could take things easy , it makes a man wonder . Fellah works hard all his life , tries to make both ends meet , gets a little ahead , where does it get him ? Like I told my wife , I said , man 's only got one life to live here on earth , I said , what good does it do him if all he does is work and worry ? No rest , no chance to take things easy , always something ; like I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life to live ; what 's the use ? Sometimes I wonder . Like I read a piece the other day  --  We Kill Our Presidents '  --  fellah said in there . Then I remember once when I was in Chicago some years back there was a fellah . I remember once when my wife and I was in Hot Springs , fellah jumped out the window . Like I remembernot long ago there was a piece in the paper ; I rememberyoung girl ; came out not long ago ; seventeen years old , said in the paper . Like I told her at the time , nobody knows . Nobody knows what we 're here for and we 're here for only a brief span , and puff we go out like a rotten candle and nobody knows where we go . I remember once years ago , I remember . Once I remember fellah came in the office ; he was a Shriner . Who knows ? Then there was this woman , leaned out the window to see if it was raining ; fell forty-five stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than your fingernail . When I was a boy there was a woman living not far from where we lived on South Nickleby Street and I remember all that time once when I was a boy  --  that whole winter  --  there was a man came running up this woman all that time my father came running up I remember , sort of . Tiny particle of steel no bigger . Ah God ! I said , like I told her , what 's the use ? What good does it do the first thing you know , like I told her , I said , what the hell ? What are we here for ? What does it get us ? There was that fellah in Hot Springs , there he was , jumped . Insurance salesman married man nobody knows why . Nobody knows , we were there , several years back I rememberp165there was this fellah came over to us there he was there was this place he was dead . " Carl opened his eyes . He heard MacMahon sigh , and then all at once what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangle of brush ; the darkness became a pattern of light spaces crossed with intricate planes and nets of darkness ; and directly before his eyes leaves and stalks came to life , still shadowed and wavering , but real and substantial , hard firm outlines , things that could be seen ! When he turned his head he could see MacMahon 's large ghostly face not more than a foot from his own . For a few moments MacMahon did not move . What do you suppose ? he murmured , what do you suppose ? Then his whole body gave a startled jerk . He mumbled something indistinguishable and turned to stare at Carl . They both got to their feet , Carl moving more rapidly than MacMahon . MacMahon lost his balance and went down again , thrashing about wildly before he fell , and breaking a great area of the brush as he tried to grab something substantial . " Ah , God ! " MacMahon cried aloud . " How I hate this Goddamnbrush ! " Looking over the tops of the bushes , Carl could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way off . They were almost on the far side of the tideflat away from it . All the time they had been pushing through the brush they had been going in the wrong direction , and now the factory seemed to have jumped all the way across the tideflat . The light streamed out through the ventilators and doors and the small windows under the roof . It looked strange and unfamiliar ; it looked like a ship lighted up and moving along close to shore . But Carl put his hand to his bruised face and let the waves of sickness and despair rush over him ; he thought of what MacMahon was going to say , of sneaking back to the factory through the brush , of explaining , apologizing , covering up . . . . Even while he was going down he grabbed wildly at excuses : I got turned around , he kept thinking , I must have got turned around . Hep166drew himself up , almost shrinking from what MacMahon was going to say , waiting for it as he might have waited for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knife between his shoulder blades . But a long time passed before MacMahon caught on . He looked at the factory in a dull and shrunken surprise . " Look , " he said . " Look . " Carl did not answer him ; his mind was still trapped and darting ; he did not know what to say.  | HE tossed the light down to someone standing on the track . Around him the men began dropping off the deck down into the narrow canyon between the vats and the log deck . The man who received the light darted under the factory . The log had not been moved . It rested in a pit between the foundations of the deck and the track , the side toward the factory brightly lighted now with the two flashlights and the other side shadowed and steaming . Here , someone said . Give it here . He could see where they had tried to build up a support for the jacks to be set against , and where the supports had given way . Timbers had been set against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jack had buried itself in the soft bark and the wood . Now they were building up another supportagainst the pilings under the factory . Loose timbers were being passed underneath and arranged in place . He heard the men call to one another in sharp , absorbed cries . Give me a hand , someone said . Here . He dropped to the track . Gil Ahab passed him , carrying one end of a weather-beaten timber . The light from under the factory caught Gil Ahab for an instant and he could see his face twisted with the weight he was carrying and the effort he made to keep his balance . The timber was dropped and moved under the factory . There was a cramped stirring about as the men adjusted it in place.  |p168The  group around the log suddenly split , and Hagen crawled out of the cramped space under the factory . He could see the hoist man still lying pressed into the ground in the narrow tunnel of light , lying on his side with his shoulder jammed up hard against his cheek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Someone pushed him violently . Get out of the way ! Another timber slid under the factory . He stepped back . Gil Ahab stopped beside him , breathing heavily , watching the timber being slid under the factory by the men kneeling beside the foundations . When it disappeared he called out , " How many more ? " Someone close to the log crowded forward . " How many more ? " The answer from under the factory was strained and muffled . " Five  --  six more . " He started off after the men who were carrying the timbers . Passing along the doors of the vats , he felt the heat that escaped around the doors and smelled the hot wood inside , a kind of medicinal smell that came from the steaming bark and sap . When they were out of the light he staggered over the rough track . He could hardly see his companions , but he could hear the rustle of their clothes and their heavy breathing . He glanced back . The kneeling figures around the log were screened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vats . The timbers were being taken from a pile of refuse at the end of the row of vats . Here the darkness was complete , and as Winters felt over the pile of rubbish , searching for a piece that was substantial and that could be taken away , he heard the other men stumbling over the pile , tugging at some timber that seemed the right size , or moving the heavier pieces to free one that was caught . There was no talking . Now and then someonecursed briefly when he hurt himself or wasted his strength tugging on some piece that could not be worked free . He groped forward unsteadily until his hands touched a timber that seemed suitable . He felt along it to find out if itp169was too long to go under the factory . One end was buried in a pile of heavier timbers . For a few moments he pulled at it senselessly , until a kind of red glow spread over the darkness and his hands burned from the splinters in the wood . He gave up , and leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Someone said , " Here 's one . Give me a hand . " He started toward the voice , but someone else said , " I got it , " and he heard the men cautioning each other as they carried it away . Easy now , they said . Easy . All right . Watch out . Someone shouted , Do n't bring any more ! Hagen ! Do n't monkey with that ! Get twenty-thirty men and lift one end and block it up . Then roll it back . He heard Frankie Dwyer yelling , Use your heads ! Some of you guys go look in them cars and sec if you can dig up another light ! They ran around the head end of the mill toward the office and the parking space . In the intense dark he stumbled and fell . He could hear the others running through the tall grass and the stray curses as they stumbled . The ground was cut with drainage ditches and was still damp with the seepage from the factory . As soon as he got away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ditches and the heaps of scrap metal becamegreat pits of shadow . A car was drawn up before the office . As he approached and his footsteps sounded on the driveway there was a stir of movement in the car ; two figures separated with a violent , explosive movement . He called out , " Have you people got a flashlight ? " There was no answer . The lights went on . In the indirect light of the dash he saw a girl sitting behind the steering wheel , looking ruffled and indignant , her head lifted up and her large chin thrust forward . On the opposite side of the seat a boy was watching him , looking scared and uncertain . " A man 's hurt , " he said . " We need a flashlight . " They looked at each other . The girl made a little convulsive movement and smoothed her dress around her legs . Her dressp170had been pulled up around her waist . He repeated that a man was hurt , but they only stared at him blankly . The boy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come on ! " he said sharply . " A man 's hurt . You hear ? We need a light . " The girl straightened up obediently and the boy lifted the scat cushion . They searched among the tools and in the pockets on the doors , silently but hurriedly , occasionally glancing up to see if he was watching them . They were afraid of him . The knowledge of it surprised him . Then he saw some of the men looking into the other cars , and called to them . " Never mind ! It 'll take too long ! We 'll drive this one up and use the headlights ! " They came back , gathering around the car . The ambulance was coming up the road ; some of the men ran out to hail it . It drew up in the parking space and two men , their white uniforms conspicuous in the dark , stepped out on the gravel . Here ! someone said . This way ! He said to the girl , " Drive on around the office . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get stuck we 'll lift you out . " She looked at him , her large face empty and dazed . The boy said , " See here . " " Come on ! " he said impatiently . " We 'll use your headlights . See ? We 'll push you out if you get stuck . " She looked at him and then at the men crowding around the car . " We have n't got a flashlight , " she said . He stepped on the running-board and held the side of the car . She drew back , looking in bewilderment at the mud on his hands . " All right , " he said . " We 're set . Go ahead . " Walt Connor pushed his way through the men . " What 's wrong ? What 's wrong , Winters ? What 's the trouble ? " The girl said , " Walt ! What 's the matter ? Who 's hurt ? "  |p171Walt  pulled at his shoulder . " Come on , Winters , what the hell 's the matter with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll push you out if you get stuck . You wo n't have to go far . Just so your headlights reach them . " He turned to Walt . " Let go ! They got to have light , you dumb bastard . " " The ambulance is here ! " " That do n't give them any light ! " " They got two flashlights up there now . " " Who 's hurt ? " the girl said . " Walt ! Who is it ? " " Look here , " the boy said weakly . " Listen . " " For Christ 's sake ! " Winters opened the door and pushed the girl over on the seat . The headlights spread over the waste of bunch grass . " Push me if I get stuck , " he said . The car lurched off the gravel and into the first shallow ditch . The rear wheels spun in the mud for an instant . Then they went out into open ground , and as he shifted into second he saw the men running beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car with both hands . His dinner jacket was pulled awkwardly around him , his high collar sank into the soft flesh under his chin . Except when he glanced at Winters , he watched the ground that opened up under the headlights , his mouth sagging open , his features frozen into an expression of alarm . He had a high forehead and a great mass of light curly hair . Whenever they approached a deeper gash in the field tense lines of anticipa-t ion crossed his forehead , his lips drew back from his teeth and his hands tightened on the side of the car . Winters thought : they 're afraid I 'll wreck it . They do n't believe I can handle it . He whipped the car around a heap of scrap iron , feeling a little thrill of pleasure that the car responded so easily , everything tight and tuned up , the control perfect , a light touch on the wheel moving at once through the whole machine . To reassure them he said , out of the side of his mouth , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . "  |p172His  words made them jump . They think I 'm crazy , he thought , and grinned as he bore down on the gas . The girl too was extremely nervous . She sat far forward in the seat , awkwardly , bracing herself with her hand against the dashboard when the car lurched . As the front wheels approached a drop her whole body rose and a grimace of pain and fright , almost of anguish , shot convulsively over her round features ; her eyes tightened shut . When they got around the corner of the building the lights opened up a cleared space to the head end of the factory . The lights were reflected , dimly , against the log vats . When the car dropped into one of the ditches the lights danced up to the roof or toward the sky or straight at the tangled grass . A drainage ditch opened up at the far reach of the light and he stepped on it , bearing down on the gas while the girl began to scream . The drop almost threw him out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and forth , the rear wheels singing against the grass and mud , until the men crowded around it , heaving until it pulled free . When he could see the men working in the space between the vats and the log deck , he stopped and switched off the motor . " Leave it here , " he said . He got out and sprinted toward the vats . The light was still too far away but the track and the log were clearer ; the men were standing back to let the light fall full on the log . They were jacking it up slowly when he got there , thrusting the blocks under the log to save each grudging inch that it lifted . Frankie Dwyer heaved at the jack and as the head of the jack pressed against the log the sap squirted out and ran down the threaded metal . The men were silent . Winters could hear the doors of the vats tremble under the pressure of the steam inside , the scrape of the jack , the heavy breathing of the men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was better . Under the factory one of the men from the ambulance said , " Easy . Do n't try to pull on him . "  |p173The  log lifted slowly . The crew stood by , jamming the timbersunder it to save the lift if the jack gave way . Dwyer stood up suddenly . " That 's all , " he said . " That 's all the higher it will go . " They crowded around . " Heave on it , " somebody said . They stood packed close together , each with one hand on the log . " All set ? " Dwyer asked . There was an answering murmur from under the factory . " Heave ! " he said . " Heave ! " The log lifted slightly . Winters could feel the man beside him tremble . The damp ground sank under his feet ; the soft bark of the log cut his hand . He could feel the flesh on his face tighten and draw away from his mouth and eyes before the red light began to spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reflected light from the car . " All right , " a voice said . " Let it drop . " They stepped back . The hoist man was lying on the stretcher and they were moving him out from under the factory . Both his legs were crushed and covered with mud where they had been buried under the log . Easy , the men said . Easy . They brought him out ; the men from the ambulance straightened and lifted the stretcher ; someone grabbed a flashlight and held it on the ground before them . Then they went off toward the ambulance , the crowd moving slowly behind them . Hagen said wearily , " Somebody help me put away these jacks . " Winters watched the stretcher until it disappeared around the building . All at once he let down , crumpling up inside with the weight of misery he was carrying ; only the effort he had been making had held him up . Unconsciously he moved toward the vats and leaned against them for support . He was sick . He breathed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top part of his lungs , not to get down to the depths where the pressure was aching and intense . A hundred men were crowded into the narrow space between the vats and the platform . A dull murmur arose from them asp174the hoist man was carried away . The brutal images forced themselves on Winters ' memory as he waited , the full abyss of his plight opened up ; in anguish he thought of them all sitting in the factory , complaining about Carl , while the hoist man had lain crushed and broken under the log , the bones of his legs slowly emerging from their sheath of flesh . In anguish he knew what was going to happen , and as surely as he knew that there was no hope for the hoist man he knew that Ann was dying , and understood what it was going to mean to him , and saw that he could not lie to himself any more . He saw her again lying in the hopeless room of the hospital , her hands clenching as the spasms of pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think about that ; but now his memorywould give him nothing but images of misery and terror , until it seemed he had lived all his life on the scene of some vast wreck that had strewn the world with its victims ; now he remembered the " accidents " in the logging camps and in the mills where he had worked , the ruined bodies of cripples , the loggers whose intestines were ruptured and torn from the weights they pulled and the mad pace of their labors , the old men who had worked in the mills and now had no hands on their arms or no fingers on their hands ; he remembered the times in his childhood when , in the little lumber camp in the mountains , the heart of the town stopped beating while the accident siren screamed at the mill . From the time of his childhood these memories had been mounting up within him , but he had never been so conscious of their weight before ; he had never gotten so close to the edge of horror . He could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Around him the men murmured dully and bitterly , blaming themselves for not having moved more swiftly , complaining because men had to do work that was so hazardousand could so easily be made safe . Some of them were moving back into the dark factory , silent , sickened at the accident and exhausted by the strain they had been under ,  |p175by  the minutes of helplessness before they could get the hoist man free . Suddenly Hagen said , in answer to some inaudible question , " I 've seen twenty men killed since I 've been here , " and at the sound of his voice Winters pulled himself together ; he tried to grope his way back to life . I 'm finished , he thought ; this is my last night here , wondering dully why Carl had not already found him and told him to get his time . He tried to make himself think of leaving , of looking for a new job , of going from one place to another while Ann was dying  --  how would they treat her if he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no answers to those questions . As he waked up he saw that some of the men had gathered around him and in a dim way he thought they were waiting for him to tell them something , to answer the questions they had not learned to ask , but he was too sick and disheartened to speak . They waited patiently and silently and when he did not say anything they were not conscious of any disappointment ; they were sorry that he would be fired ; they wanted to know what to do . Someone asked , " Who 's got a cigarette ? " Dwyer handed them around , and they smoked , standing in the steaming dark and waiting . " I heard you konked him , " Dwyer said . " Yeah . " " What was the matter ? " " He would n't give me the flashlight . " " Did he see who you were ? " " Yeah . " He hesitated . " MacMahon too . He was there too . " " What do you figure on doing ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to get a job on that road crew working in the mountains . If I ca n't connect there I do n't know what I 'll do . " A voice said , " They 're hiring men up there . They fire two and hire one . "  | " You konked him , " Dwyer said . " Jesus . " " Yeah . " " Come on , " Hagen said . " Somebody give me a hand with this stuff . " They moved reluctantly . Dwyer stepped on his cigarette . " I wish I 'd seen it . I only wish I 'd seen it . " They picked up the jacks and started to carry them back to the fireroom . " Somebody bring the peavey , " Hagen said . " It wo n't be here if you do n't . " Somebody asked suddenly , " Who was that guy ? " " Who ? " " The guy who was hurt . " " The hoist man . " " Yeah , but what was his name ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hagen called , " what 's the hoist man 's name ? " " I do n't know . All I know is they called him Little Rock because he was born in Little Rock . " " Little Rock , " Hagen said to the man who asked him . " Little Rock . "  |p177IT  WAS shadowed where he came out of the brush , and no one could see him . He took a deep breath in relief . Then he saw a group of men standing about twenty feet away from him . He did not hesitate . He hurried toward them and slapped his hands briskly . " All right , men ! " he called out . As they turned toward him he said cheerfully , " We 've got them back on ! Let 's get back inside now ! " For a moment they did not move . They gaped at him . One of the men was sitting down , and he got to his feet slowly , watching Carl as he did so . " The whistle has n't blown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a sickly smile and the group stirred ; in the dim light he saw one of the men in back looking over his companion 's shoulder , his mouth hangingopen in an idiot surprise . But Carl felt no rancor . He only wanted to get something accomplished . " We 've had a long rest ! " he reminded them . " Whistle has n't blown ! " The tideflat was littered with them . There were hundreds of them in the cleared space between the office and the head end of the mill . They were clustered in small groups and he hurried from one group to another , holding his arms extended and herding them back into the factory . " All right , men ! " he kept crying . " Back inside ! They 're back on now ! Let 's get back inside ! " He was dimly aware that they were watching him , that they moved slowly , that they stopped after they had moved a few feet . He did not care . He was glad to be busy again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He came up to one young fellow standing off by himself , staring toward the office , and slapped him amiably on the shoulder . " All right , Jack ! " he said . " Let 's hit the ball ! " The boy turned around and started . He gaped at Carl . Then he stepped back awkwardly and fell down . A grotesque spasm of panic crossed his features as he fell . Carl grinned as he watched him scramble to his feet again . " That 's the stuff ! " he called heartily , and hurried on to meet another group . But someone began tugging on his arm . " I wanted to ask you , " Morley said abruptly . " I called the power house . " Carl turned around . Morley was standing behind him , holding a sheaf of papers in his hand . " Morley ! " Carl cried . " Where have you been ? " " I called the power house , " Morley replied nervously . " They said they 'd be on in a minute . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until I asked you . " Carl nodded . But he felt tired , all at once ; his enthusiasm for sending the men back into the factory drained away . " Fine , " he said , with a mechanical cheerfulness . " Fine , Morley . " Morley ruffled the papers nervously and stared at his feet . " I did n't want to have to blow the whistle , " he explained , " until I saw you , after I found out they were coming back on . " " That 's right ! " Carl cried . " That was right ! " " I figured you did n't know they were coming right back on . So I thought I better wait till I asked you before I told him to blow the whistle . " Carl nodded . They were silent for a few moments . " Mr. MacMahon wants to see you , " Morley said . " He told me if I saw you to tell you that he wants to see you . " Carl sighed , " What does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me where you were , and I said Ip179did n't know so he told me to go find you and tell you he wanted to see you . " A crowd had gathered around them . Carl waved his arms . " Back inside ! " he said . " All inside ! All right , men ! " No one moved . They gawked at him . He turned to Morley . " Listen , Morley , " he whispered . " What 's the matter ? " Morley whispered back , " Somebody was hurt . I guess that 's what 's the matter . " " Hurt ? " " Yes . A man was hurt . " " Who ? " " I do n't know . They took him away in an ambulance . " " Tonight ? " " Yes . " " My God , " he said . " Hurt . Who was it ? " " I do n't know . " " You sure ? " " Yes . The ambulance came and took him away . " " Ambulance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Carl said . " Poor fellah , " he said blankly . When he put his hand to his face he felt his bruised lip and the sweat and dirt on his face . " I hate to have that happen . How did that happen ? Who was it ? " " I do n't know , " Morley said . " You see , I had to call the power house and then when I found they would be on any minute I wanted to ask you if you still wanted Mike to blow the whistle so I had to look for you and I never had a chance to find out . " " How was he hurt ? Bad ? Was it bad ? " Morley ruffled his papers and half turned in embarrassment . " I do n't know , I .... " Carl gave a great sigh of despair . " Ah , God , " he said sadly . " To think .... " He put his hand over his eyes.  |p180Morley  was surprised at this turn of affairs . He had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much about the man who was hurt . Also , he thought he had been very daring in calling the power house instead of telling Mike to blow the whistle , and he had been excited and stimulated with wonder about how Carl would react to it . Since Carl had told MacMahon that Morley had called the power house , and since he had not done it , he was afraid he might be blamed if the lights remained off . First , making a decision cost him a great deal of nervous energy , and afterwards , feeling his way through the dark and dodging the men as he looked for Carl gave him no time to think of anything else . He also felt a stricken shame at Carl 's emotion because he had felt so little . He had not realized how tender-hearted Carl was . He felt guilty and shallow that he had not been similarly moved . Now a sad look came on his face . His mouth drooped and he shook his head in a melancholy fashion . " Poor fellow , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulders and looked the whole world in the face . But there was a sad expression around his mouth . " It 's hard , " he said simply . " That 's the way it goes . " He spoke to Morley , and although he looked directly at Morley there was a far-away look in his eyes , as if he were seeing something beyond . " Too bad , " Morley replied . " Certainly is too bad , all right . " " Why do such things have to happen ? " Carl asked the uncaringnight , repeating man 's age-old question as he reached down and scratched a mosquito bite on his leg . " No matter what you do . . . . It gets you in the end . Never know . " Morley said haltingly . " It certainly seems like a shame , all right . " Carl sighed again . He pulled himself together once more and looked around . Not all of the crowd had followed the stretcher . Some of the men were watching him . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ andp181whispering among themselves . Carl was somewhat confused . He did not know what to do . It seemed somewhat out of keepingto order them briskly to get back inside . He had a vague desire to let them see that he was profoundly stirred by the accident . So he said to Morley , but in a slightly louder voice , " One of my own men . . . I do n't know . . . . It 's hard . " After a decent pause , Morley replied , " Mr. MacMahon wants to see you . " " Tell him I 'll see him in a minute . I 've got to see if everything'sall right . " " Tell him  --  " Morley began . " Tell him I 'll be busy for a while , " Carl said soberly . " Explain . A man 's hurt . He 's got to be taken care of . " " Then you 'll come up ? " Carl nodded . Morley hesitated for a moment . " He 's up there , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes . " Carl nodded thoughtfully . " I 'll come up as soon as I finish . " He walked over to one of the workers . " Is everything all right , " he asked gravely . " What ? " The man gawked at him . " Is everything all right ? Is he taken care of ? " Carl noted that the man , as well as others who gathered behind him , were staring at his legs . He looked down . His overalls were covered with the white pulpy chemicals from his wading under the factory . One trouser leg was torn to ribbons . Large gobs of mud were plastered on his clothes . He looked up at the man again , this time sternly . " Well , " he said , " what about it ? " His voice was a little sharp . The cat got your tongue ? he asked silently . " Is it all settled ? " The worker said , " Yeah . I guess so . "  |p182From  the crowd a voice said distinctly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl flashed a dirty look in the direction of the voice . The faces that he could see were expressionless . It surprised him to note how few individuals were required to make a crowd . A hundred workers seemed to cover the whole tideflat . Carl 's sad feelings had disappeared . The man he had questioned was looking up toward the clouds and absently caressing his neck . Carl watched him for a moment with intense hostility . " All right , " he said . " Let 's get back to work then . " He spoke in a low voice . He intended to speak loudly but somehow he got started wrong , the words thinned out in his throat , and no one could hear him except the people near by . No one moved . Carl hesitated and then turned and walked back in the direction in which Morley had disappeared . He walked with a self-consciousdignity , frowning at the rubbish and at the clumps of weeds he could barely see . He could hear the men following him at a distance . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the factory . But then he decided it would be useless just to send in a few at a time ; they would n't be able to do anything ; it would be better to round up the whole crew and send them in together . Yes , he decided , that was more sensible , and immediately he felt relieved and glad that he had thought of such a sensible plan so he would n't have to turn around and tell them to go back to work . He walked slowly , with his head slightly bowed . A large crowd followed him . " He 's all right , " he mumbled , while he was still some distance away . He did not want to give MacMahon a chance to say anything to him about the time they had spent in the brush . As he came near the car he decided he would start to talk before MacMahon had a chance . In order to accomplish this , he wished to give an impression of great business ; he wanted to bark out orders , hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all the things he had to do.  | " Who ? " MacMahon asked suspiciously . " Fe11ah was hurt . We got him in the ambulance . " " Hurt ? " " Yes . " " Who was hurt ? " " A fellah . . . . We got him in an ambulance  --  sent him to the hospital . Only thing to do . " Here Carl sighed and shook his head . He was standing quite near the car , and he looked at MacMahon somberly , his eyes dark and shadowed , his bruised lips pressed shut . " Who ? Who was it ? Was it bad ? " " Bad , pretty bad . Had to go to the hospital , " Carl sighed again . " Carelessness , carelessness , " he murmured . MacMahon stared rather helplessly at the crowd drawn up around the car . He looked as if he were awakening in some strange place , and could not determine where he was , or as if he were unable to decide whether or not some involved practicaljoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent and inquisitive . The faces were dimly revealed by the lights from the factory and from the car . Now Carl shook off his despondency in the way that a man takes off his coat before plunging into a fight . After he had murmured , " Carelessness , carelessness , " he stared at the ground for a moment in a silent tribute to the injured man . Hail and farewell ! He filled his lungs and exhaled audibly . Then he leaped into action . First he shook his head violently as a swimmer does when he rises above the water after a long dive . Next he gave a swift , searching , disapproving glance at the crowd gathered around . " Morley ! " he said . Morley started . " Get them back to work , " Carl said , speaking loudly so that the men would hear him . A few of them edged a short way back into the shadows . Most of them continued to watch Carl and MacMahon with a fascinated incredulity . Carl saw Hagen walking back toward the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same sharp voice , " Hagen ! Comep184here a minute . " Hagen looked up , and as he did so Carl called again , adding , " Come here a minute , will you ? " a little more gently , thinking perhaps his first order had sounded somewhat too abrupt . Hagen responded with a sort of sluggish patience . " Well , Hagen , " Carl said briskly . " Have you got them fixed ? Are they on for good ? " Hagen realized that this was for MacMahon 's benefit . He nodded . But he could not keep from smiling at Carl 's appearance , and at MacMahon 's dirty tuxedo . He looked at the glue on their pants and at the mud smeared over them , and wondereddimly what they had been doing under the factory . " All right then , " Carl went on . " Let 's get back to work . No use hanging around here . " Hagen nodded again . He thought of explaining that he wanted to get a small crew to clean up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much trouble ; he knew that Carl would not be able to understand what he wanted to do ; that he would show off because MacMahon was standing beside him ; that he would ask a lot of fool questions ; and that he would believe that Hagen was merely stalling . Hagen felt too tired to go through all the explanations that Carl would require ; it would be easier to scrape up a crew somehow and get it done with no talking . When Carl saw the faint grin on Hagen 's face he was conscious of a tense rise of excitement . He took it for granted that Hagen was grinning because of the tricks that had been played on him . He watched Hagen 's expression while he put his fingers to his bruised lips , and when Hagen looked away with a kind of forced indifference , Carl 's suspicions became stronger . " What was the trouble ? " he asked ominously . " What ? " " Did you find out what the trouble was ? " " What trouble ? "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out what happened . What was it ? " Hagen glanced at MacMahon , who was listening to this conversation with a deaf expression , as though hoping to be able to understand something later on . Now MacMahon looked at Hagen with an obvious accusation on his features . Hagen expected this sort of underhanded evasion of responsibility from Carl ; nevertheless he was always indignant when it happened and when Carl hinted that he was to blame for whatever went wrong . " Nothing was wrong here , " he said . " Whatever happened was at the power house . I thought you were going to call them . I been working with the hoist man . I have n't had any time . " Now MacMahon , who began , after a few moments , to comprehendthe general drift of the conversation , said , " Look here , Hagen ; I want to ask you a question . " " What ? " " I want to ask you a question , Hagen , " MacMahon repeated . " Look here a minute . I want to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm toward the factory . " What made all that trouble now , what made the lights go out ? We ca n't have that all the time . " " It was n't here , " Hagen replied . " It was at the power house . " " Power house ? " " Yes , the power house . Something happened at the power house . The power went off . So the lights went out . " " Then we ought to get after them . The minute it happened . Ca n't have things like that . . . I nearly killed myself in there . Fell right on my side . " MacMahon prodded his side gently . " Wonder I was n't hurt worse . " Hagen said nothing for a moment while he watched MacMahonprobe at his bruises . Then he said , " Another guy was hurt , too . " " Yes . You see ? We ca n't have things like that , Hagen . No excuse for it . You want to watch that . "  |p186Meanwhile  Morley was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , murmuring apologetically and almost inaudibly , " All right , men . Might as well get back inside now , I guess . " Most of the men paid no attention to him . Some of them pretended that they did not hear , and a few moved a short distance and stopped ; Morley hurried through the crowd because he did not want to pause long enough to see whether his orders were being obeyed . One man said , " No use , Molly . There ai n't any steam . Mike pulled his fires , " but this created so many disturbing thoughts that Morley rushed on without waiting to find out if it was true . Carl finally said , " No use crying over spilt milk , I guess . We better get back to work . " He gave MacMahon what he felt was a meaning look . Then he shouted impatiently , " All right , fellows ! No use hanging around here ! Get on inside ! The whistle has n't blown ! " The men began to break up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfy Carl . " We have n't got all night ! " he shouted . " Let 's get a move on ! " He saw a man lagging behind , watching him steadily . The man barely moved . He shuffled along , making a pretense of walking , just beyond the circle of light from the car . Carl did not hesitate . He took a few steps toward the man . " You ! " he snapped . " Ca n't you hear ? " Winters was waiting for Hagen . He thought at first that Carl recognized him . " Yes . " " Then what are you hanging around for ? I said get on inside . " Carl drew a deep breath and raised his voice so it could reach MacMahon . " God dammit , the minute anything happens here you guys think it gives you an excuse to take it easy  --  you 've had an hour to take it easy , now what are you fellows hanging around for ? " " I have n't been taking it easy , " Winters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he felt a weak clutch of memory and recognition . Something , he did not knowp187what , made him remember the man who had knocked him down ; he remembered lying on the floor and watching the light go dancing off across the factory , and Morley tugging at his arm ; he remembered himself holding his mouth and listening to Morley , and thinking of washing his face , the whole experiencemixed up into a confused and humiliating and miserable sequence of thoughts and events . When he looked questioninglyat Winters , expecting some support for his memory , or some sign as to why it reoccurred , he saw Winters merely waitingimpassively , his dark features expressionless , but with a generalattitude of distaste and impatience suggested by the way in which he waited . Now Carl looked doubtful , and turned mechanically to appeal to Morley , but Morley was nowhere in sight . On his part , Winters saw the half-recognition that was reflectedon Carl 's face . As soon as Carl turned away he became excited ; his indifference disappeared ; he started at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there , " he said , " helpingget the hoist man loose . I surer than hell have n't been loafing . I told Hagen I 'd help him pick up some stuff  --  them jacks and some stuff . " Winters said this somewhat sharply , with a faint desire to lead Carl off the subject and to make him forget that he had been knocked down . But Carl was irritated by his tone . " Are you working for him now ? " Winters flushed . He said , " Hell , I just wanted to find out where the stuff belonged . " " Well , get a move on . Get a move on ! The minute the lights go out you fellows think . . . . It do n't do any good to tell you . " Winters flared up a little . He spread his hands before Carl indignantly . " Look at that , " he said . " You think I been loafing ? " Carl did not hear him . He was merely aware that Winters was arguing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being knocked down in the factory ; he saw that the crowdp188was gathering again , drawn by the argument , and he lost his temper . But this time his anger did not explode in accusations or insults ; he looked at Winters tranquilly , noting the dark flush on his features , his air of resentment and uncertainty . He said , without passion , with a kind of surprise that he said it , " Go punch your card . " Carl had fired a great many men in his life . Most of them he never saw , for they merely found their notices when they came to get their pay . There were only a few ways in which those who were fired on the job responded . Usually they shrugged with an affectation of indifference and walked away . Sometimes they became angry and tried to argue , and on these occasions it was Carl who shrugged and walked away . Sometimes , though less frequently , a man who was fired tried to explain or apologize , and on a few occasions Carl had got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have Wintersfollow any of these courses . His own emotions were not disturbed . On the contrary , he felt relieved and at peace as soon as he told Winters to punch his card ; it was like getting over some painful operation , and as soon as it was past there was no further reason for worry . Winters too shrugged his shoulders and glanced around with a slightly uncertain and embarrassed smile . " All right , " he said . He was surprised to see the crowd that had gathered around . As he walked away Sorenson grabbed him by the arm and spoke to him in a low voice . " What happened ? " " I got the can . " " What for ? " " Nothing . . . . Son of a bitch is off his nut . " Winters looked back at Carl . He saw the crowd gathering , the men looking at him questioningly . He felt slightly embarrassed , even through his anger , at being in the center of the crowd . Sorenson said under his breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice in a querulous protest , " Hey , Carl ! What 's the sense of firing the kid ? He was n't doing anything . What the hell ? " Someone else said , " Jesus , what do you pick on him for ? " Carl was undisturbed by these voices . " Never mind , " he said . " Let 's get back to work . " Hagen pushed his way through the crowd . " I asked him , " he said hotly . " It ai n't his fault . I asked him to give me a hand with that junk . Jesus Christ . For a thing like that . " They were standing about fifty feet away from the car . The light here was ragged and dim , and Carl could barely see Hagen 's large , pulpy face , thick and fat and streaked with sweat and grease , before a wave of physical loathing blinded him . He could not say anything for a moment ; the words kept going through him  --  Butting in , butting in  --  until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He lifted his hands in a curious interrupted gesture , holding his hands clenched as he brought them up beside his waist . " Then why do n't he do it ? Why do n't he do it ? " His voice sounded mad and almost exultant in its fury ; some of the workers automatically stepped away from him . He turned to Winters . " Go on ! " he shouted . " Go punch your card ! " Hagen said , " If you fire him you can pull my card too . It ai n't his fault . " This time Carl did not hesitate . His voice was trembling with excitement . He said , " Go punch your card , then , " and waved his arm in a jerky , interrupted gesture toward the factory . " Punch it , get out of here , stop butting in  --  God , stop making trouble ! " He walked toward the factory for a little way , stumbling in the rough ground , before he turned and headed back to the car . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head down and his features were distorted with an expression of impotence ; he looked suddenly helpless and blind.  |p190Hagen  did not lose control of himself . He watched Carl contemptuously , with relief that he could express his contempt . He said to the men , " Are you going to stand for it ? " Winters had grown extremely excited . He rushed up beside Hagen and began talking incoherently to the men . " Let him fire me . I do n't give a damn . But are you going to let him get away with it ? What for ? So he can shoot off his mouth  --  for nothing  --  so he can go punch your card  --  a little tin god . Are you going to let him get away with it ? " Carl had stopped and lifted his head to stare at Winters . " Why jump on me ? " Winters asked him . " What was I doing ? I been doing my work . I been doing what I was supposed to do . You know God-damn well I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only want to shoot off your mouth . You only want to raise hell with somebody . " Sorenson pushed his way between Winters and Carl . " Wait , " he kept saying . " Wait a minute . Do n't fly off the handle . " He turned to Carl , " What 's the idea ? " he asked . " Why jump on the kid ? Everybody else . Why jump on him ? Why jump on Hagen ? " He began to argue , keeping his face close to Carl 's and starting when Carl tried to interrupt him . " You ca n't settle everything in a minute . Listen to reason  --  it just makes trouble ; listen , Carl , listen . Now wait . What was he doing ? " From time to time Sorenson would turn to warn Winters and the men around him . " Pipe down , " he would say . " Take it easy . " Winters said , " I do n't give a damn . Let him fire me . But you guys . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mean anything to me . I 'm out of here . But you ought to kick  --  he can pull anything he wants if you do n't kick  --  he can do anything he wants to . " Five or six men began talking at once . Some of them pressed in , asking what had happened , and some of them joined in with Sorenson as he questioned Carl . Carl looked around uncertainly . The voices were loud and confused , some of themp191angry and most of them only excited , but they wore on his nerves like the sound of files on steel . Still his uncertainty increasedhis anger , for as he glanced at the faces around him , and drew back from the repeated cries , the sharp Wait a second . Listen , wait a second , he held to his anger in the way that a man holds to a rope that prevents him from drowning . He tried to brush Sorenson aside . " Morley ! " he shouted . Morley said , " Yes ? " and appeared mysteriously beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! What the hell 's the matter with you ? " Morley nodded apologetically , but before he could answer Sorenson pushed him away . " No sense sending them inside , Carl . There ai n't any steam  --  Mike pulled his fires . Listen . " Then he turned hotly toward the men . " Let me finish , will you ? " Carl grabbed Morley by the arm . " Go tell Mike to blow the whistle . And do it . You hear . " He stared at Morley with a hatred so shameless and abandoned that Morley instinctively drew back . Then Carl pushed him slightly , a weak , contemptuousshove . " I told you , " he said , " an hour ago . " The crowd gave way around them , and the men became silent . Only a few could hear what Carl said , but they saw Morley move away a few feet and turn back on Carl with a bruised and shocked resentment , and they saw the fury on Carl 's face . When the blur of voices stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden deafness that comes as one drops down in an elevator . Morley had grown pale ; his eyes darted indecisively around the circle of men . But Carl had turned on him too suddenlyand too brutally for him to accept it ; and the number of men watching him , and the sudden silence , prevented him from leaving . He began to protest and explain , his indignation becomingclearer as he spoke , his sense of injury and humiliation making his voice tremble . He said that he had intended to tell Mike to blow the whistle when he found out that the lights were coming back on , and that afterwards he had looked forp192Carl and had not been able to find him . Then Carl had told him that he had been right in not having Mike blow the whistle , and since the lights had come on he had been too busy to do it . After he started to talk he could not stop , for every time he paused he became conscious of the crowd again , and stricken with the novelty of talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his indignation by going on . But in the half darkness he looked wizened and afraid , like some small trapped animal turning in its flight and facing its pursuer with a desperateand gasping bravery . The men were silent , as they were always silent before an outburst of emotion . " What could I do ? " Morley kept saying . " I looked for you . I went all over . I went out in the stockroom . I went back to the office  --  I thought maybe you were hurt . I told them to get inside ; what else could I do ? " Carl glanced at Morley . " All right , " he said . " Go tell him now . " Then he said to the men , " Get on inside , " his voice cold and dead , and nodded to Winters and Hagen , " Go on , " he said , " get out of here . " Winters grinned . " Go to hell , " he said . " Will you ? "  | HE had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive the car over the tideflat and that Winters was making a fool of himself ordering Rose around , and he had tried to stop him , to bring him back to earth . It was senseless because anyone could see there was no help for the man who was hurt . He had been up there . The talk with Hagen 's boy had left him with a dull self-disgust that was partly a fear that he had put himself too much in Johnny 's hands or that the girls would make fun of him , and partly revulsion at talking down to Johnny . He had walked around the tideflat until he found the accident ; it sickened him , and there seemed to be nothing he could do to help , so he wandered away again until he saw MacMahon 's car and saw Winters , evidently out of his head , yelling madly and finally getting in and driving across the tideflat . He ran over the uneven ground after the car , conscious of the growing crowd around the head end of the mill in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he kept thinking . He ca n't say I did n't tell him . When he caught up , he found Rose pressed back against the corner of the seat , her eyes darting at the men who ran past toward the head end of the mill , her mouth twitching nervously , and he felt sorry for her , suddenly , thinking how strange and bewildering it all must seem to her . Her features lighted up with relief when she saw him . " Walt , " she asked , " who is it ? "  |p194He  had known her in school , but then she had been only a quiet girl with few friends and he had paid no attention to her , and now the thought of all that had happened since then crossed his mind with a memory of how ordinary she had seemed then and how indifferent he had felt toward her . " I do n't know . " " Was it ? " " No . It was one of the men . " She smiled shakily and sighed . The people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the car and the vats shouting , " Keep out of the light ! " whenever anyonepassed in front of the car . He was stirred again to think how much she must have been worried about her father . . . . " What do you suppose happened to him ? " she whispered . " He 's been gone an awful long time . " " He 's probably trying to get that poor devil free , " he said . " A log rolled on him . " She looked up toward the men moving rapidly around the vats , her eyes widening . She had changed since he had seen her , he decided , the sullenness had gone out of her face and she looked older . The long white evening dress made her look slim and cool . He did not know the boy sittingbeside her , and after he had glanced up and seen the boy staring at him inquisitively he ignored him , suddenly aware of his working clothes , his dirty hands and the grease and dirt he knew must mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was frightened too . He saw it and responded , feeling himself at ease in this place that was lost and strange to them , cursing Winters for making a fool of himself and being sure to get in trouble now . " I wish he 'd come , " Rose said helplessly . " I 've never been so nervous . " " He 'll be all right . " She whispered , " Walt , who was that man ? " " Oh . . . . " He hesitated briefly before he answered , " One of the men from the stockroom . I never heard his name . "  | " He nearly wrecked us . " The boy kept watching him , occasionally turning around to stare into the darkness when someone passed by the car . " I know . " He felt a dull oppression at the memory of Winters ' turning on him . " He , " he said , and then stopped ; he did not want to get Winters in trouble . " You have to make allowances , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hurt . You see ? His nerves are all shot . His wife is sick , maybe , or something like that . " Rose looked at him questioningly . " You understand ? " he asked . " You ca n't just say . . . . His nerves are all shot . " She did not understand him , and he felt a rise of irritation with Winters for exposing himself to trouble ; I ca n't protect him , he thought , when she said , " I do n't see what difference ... .  --  " No , I know it do n't , " he said gloomily . " He 's getting the big head ; he thinks he owns the place . " They were silent . Presently he smiled , " Well , Rose , how have you been ? " She smiled back . " Fine . And you ? " " How does it look ? " " You look fine , " she smiled . " Why do n't you ever come to see me ? " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I 'm not here I 'm in bed getting strength enough to come back . " " He told me you were working here . " " Tell him I think he must have it in for me . " " Why ? Do you really have to work hard ? " " Hard ? Good God , " he said . " Look at my hands . I do ten men 's work . " She smiled , " Poor you . " She turned to the boy beside her . " This is Roger Schwartz , Walt , " she said . " This is Walt Connor , Roger . "  |p196They  shook hands . " Glad to know you , Schwartz , " he said . " Glad to know you . " He felt uncomfortably that the people who passed were watching them , and he hesitated when she asked him to sit down , moving over in the seat to make room for him . For a moment he thought of saying that he had to go up with the others , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking him for some workman Rose happened to know and wondering at their intimacy , and he got in the car abruptly out of an involved desire to show him who he was . They were still busy at the far end of the mill ; the figures appeared and disappeared in the weak light , but the factory seemed deserted and most of the people had crossed the tideflat . Roger looked straight ahead after they shook hands , an odd set expression on his empty features , his hands pressing against his waistcoat as if he nursed some pain deep in his abdomen . Rose tried to make up for his unfriendliness , chattering steadily , partly , he thought , to smother her own worry . " What do you suppose happened to papa ? I 've never seen so much excitement . And how am I going to get back out of here ? " He nodded , grateful for her friendliness . " What 's the trouble , Walt ? " " The lights went out . " She smiled at him with a cheerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she exclaimed . " Do you always have so much trouble when the lights go out ? " He felt a twinge of embarrassment and annoyance , recognizing this bewildered impracticalwomanhood , terrified and bewildered by the complex world of machinery ; he felt a dull shame for her for having adopted this pose . " It 's tough , " he said . They were silent for a time . " Poor me , " Rose sighed . " It 's all over my head ! " Someone passing the car overheard and gave a startled glance toward them . He flushed . When hep197looked at her she was smiling at him with her head half tipped to one side and a friendly , affected smile on her face , and for the first time he saw the rich folds of flesh on her neck and her large chin  --  She 'll look like hell in a few years , he thought , and then he thought nervously , Why 'd I think that ? The boy with her looked off toward the factory , a blank indifference settling on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conscious of his overallsand his sweaty face , trying to tell himself that the boy 's clothes did n't fit him , that something spoiled the bored superiorair . He said suddenly , " I 'm going to try to get back to school next year , Rose . I may go back . Some of the fellows from the house were down last week . . . . " He paused , aware of how strange the words sounded , " If I do go back I 'll be in fine condition . That 's one reason why I wanted to work . I wanted to keep in condition , in case I decided to go back next fall . " Rose nodded and the boy glanced at him . " So you see it 's not so bad , " he said nervously . " I see , " Rose said . " If you do go back you 'll be in fine con-dition . " Why 'd I start that ? he asked silently , and answered himself , trying to let him know . He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he plunged on desperately , " I do n't care much . I figure the first two years are all a man really needs . After that .... " The boy interrupted him . " Say , " he said . " How long do you suppose we 'll have to stay here ? " Rose looked at her boy and then gave Walt a glance of understanding and apology . He got out of the car as MacMahon approached , shocked at the old man 's appearance , at his feeble walk and sagging features , his clothes torn and smeared with mud and some white pulpy chemical ; twigs , dried leaves and other debris clingingp198to his shirt and hair . As he staggered up to the car Walt stepped forward to help him , but the old man waved him aside . " Papa , " Rose said in a watery voice . MacMahon grasped the door of the car . " Do n't papa me , " he said . Suddenly he shook the door of the car as though trying to tear it off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criedRose backed away from him . " What 's the matter ? Papa ! What 's the matter ? " " Driving up here , " he said sadly . " Of all the fool tricks . You know better , Rose . It 's not as if you were a ten-year-old child . " " Papa , " Rose begged . " I 'm ashamed of you , " MacMahon said . They stared at each other . " It would be different if you did n't know better , " MacMahon said . Rose cried desperately , " Papa , I had to ! I did n't want to ! I had to . A man made me ! " MacMahon replied in a voice which was both aggrieved and accusing , but one in which the note of anger had grown a little uncertain . " You think I 'm made out of automobiles , " he said . " I had to , papa ! A man was hurt ! " For a moment MacMahon looked lost and stricken . He turned his head rapidly to stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in confusion . " What ? " Rose noted his bewilderment and took advantage of it at once . She said , " A man came down and said we had to drive up here , a man was hurt , he said they did n't have any light , first they wanted a flashlight but we could n't find it so what could I do ? I did n't want to . Did n't he , Walt ? " " Yes , Mr. MacMahon . A man was hurt up in the head end . A log rolled on him . " " Hurt ? "  | " Yes . " " Who was it ? " " One of the men . " " Tonight ? " MacMahon asked . " You mean tonight ? " " Yes . When the lights were off . " " Where is he ? " " The ambulance took him to the hospital . " " Ambulance , " MacMahon said . The crowd was gathering . He looked around nervously , ashamed for MacMahon , trying to keep him from making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's bewilderment . He 's too old , he kept thinking , it 's too hard for him . MacMahon got in the car . " It do n't make any difference , " he mumbled . " She always drives too reckless . " Carl came into the light . His face was swollen and there were streaks of dried blood on his chin . " He 's all right , " he said . MacMahon looked up . " Who ? " " Fellah was hurt . We got him in the ambulance . " " Hurt ? " " Yes . " " Who was hurt ? " " A fellah . . . . We got him in an ambulance  --  sent him to the hospital . Only thing to do . " Carl sighed wearily , his featuresexpressing only despondency and regret , his eyes somber . " Who ? Who was it ? Was it bad ? " Carl nodded . " Pretty bad . " He waited a moment , moving his hand over his forehead . Then he said quietly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked directly at Walt and Walt nodded , starting back toward the factory . The wan light from the buildings spread over the pitted ground . Somebody ought to drive that car back , he thought . Somebody ought to help . He thought of going back to help but then he thought , No , Rose would think he was trying to get himself noticed , remembering the snottyp200blond kid and his dumb superiority . He ran into one of the sawyers standing alone on the tideflat , looking back toward the car . " What 's the matter ? " the sawyer asked . " Nothing . They sent us back in . " The sawyer started back toward the car . Walt looked around . Some kind of quarrel was going on ; he could see the men pressing together and hear the excited voices . He raced back to the car . The men were standing in a tight knot a few feet away from the car ; he could see Hagen 's head above the crowd and hear Carl 's strained and bitter voice . MacMahon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few men standing near him . " You , Connor ! " MacMahon said . " Come here . " He went to the car . He glanced back at the crowd , hearing the broken and passionate cries and seeing the circle of men tightening around Carl and Hagen . Sometimes there was a solid ring of backs and then the crowd would shift and break as the men pressed closer . He could see the dark figures hurryingback across the tideflat , appearing and disappearing in the dim light from the factory . " Who is that ? " MacMahon asked . " Making all the trouble ? " " Hagen . " MacMahon had changed . The weariness and bewilderment had disappeared . He shook his head impatiently . " No . The other one . " Someone edged up beside him . " Winters , " Jug Bullett said . " Tell him to quiet down . Tell him I said if he 's got any complaint let him come see me in the morning . " Someone said , " We wo n't be working tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Saturday , then . Tell him to come see me Saturday . " Walt asked uncertainly , " What do you want us to do ? " MacMahon frowned . " Bullett , " he said , " go tell him . " Hegestured toward the rest of the men . " You fellows go along.  |p201This  is no place for that . If they want to fight they can do it somewhere else . " Walt raced up to Winters . " Listen , " he said . " MacMahon said to pipe down . He 's sore as hell . " " Tell him to go screw himself . " " No , listen , you 'll get in trouble . I 'm telling you . " Winters said to the men , " He wo n't do anything . But you ought to kick . " He saw Carl standing a short distance away , watching one of the men who was jabbering to him excitedly . " Good God ! Do you want to make trouble ? " Winters looked around at him in perplexity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't give a damn what he said . I ai n't working here any more . " Bullett came up . " It 's what he said . Come see him Saturday if you got a kick . " " To hell with him . " Walt grabbed Winters again . " I 'm telling you , let up on it . He 'll smooth it over . You can get back on . " " Let go , Walt . Do you swallow that stuff ? " He felt himself go cold , drawing back from Winters ' distortedface . " All right , " he said . " Cut your own throat . " Winters looked at him steadily , in surprise , seeing him for the first time , the bitterness in Walt 's voice breaking through his excitement . Walt had been irritated at Winters ' unreasonableness ; now he was angry with himself for pleading with Winters , for plucking at his sleeve and begging him to quiet down while the men were watching . He could sense them putting up with him ; he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the flush mounted on his cheeks . But even through his embarrassment , as he saw Winters looking at him appraisingly , a deeper and more confused emotion stirred in him , a memory of the times when he first came into the factory , when he had notp202known what to do or how much was expected of him , and the Indian had helped him , patiently , even holding up his own work to make it easy for him and taking the blame when Carl kicked . Now , when Winters asked , " Who are you trying to help ? " he felt a puzzled , probing note in Winters ' voice ; he thought that Winters was ashamed of him , and for the first time he saw the coldness and arrogance in Winters ' manner . Beyond Winters he could see MacMahon standing beside his car . Rose was half-standing , trying to see what was going on , supporting herself by holding the windshield . A group had gathered around Carl ; he could hear their rushed voices . " I 'm trying to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the words . Winters tried to quiet him . He knew it . He could tell by the patient way Winters nodded before he spoke , by the way he gently touched Walt 's shoulder . Me , he thought incredulously , you conceited bastard . " Listen , Walt , " Winters began gravely , but Walt pushed his arm away . " You damn fool , " he said . " You God-damned half-breed . " Someone pushed him . Someone said , " You 're nuts . Lay off . " Winters held his arms . " Cut it out , " Winters said . " I wo n't fight with you . " He began harping on the same thing again ; nothing could get him off that subject . He said to the men , " I 'm out of here . It do n't mean anything to me any more . But do n't let him get away with it . Do n't take it . You 've got to get that guy out of here . This is only the start . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three cuts since he 's been here . Fifty-sixty men have been dropped . And this is only the start ! You got to drive that guy out of here . You ca n't work as long as he 's here . You got to fight him off . " Someone pushed between them . Walt was shoved aside as the men moved down toward MacMahon 's car . Someone bumped him and he lost his balance ; they passed him as he stumbled in the uneven ground . When he caught up with them they werep203already around the car . Someone was talking to MacMahon , trying to smooth things over . MacMahon smiled with a ghastly forced movement of his lips . " I do n't like to interfere in these things , " he said . " It 's up to you fellows to settle this among yourselves . " " But I just told you ! How can we settle it if they both been canned ? What good does it do to settle it if they ai n't working here any more ? " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men looked at one another . MacMahon saw them hesitate , a rising impatience and irritation on the faces close to the car . " Come talk to me Saturday , " he said . " We 're all tired now . No use trying to settle anything now . " There was a long silence . " Well , " Sorenson said hesitantly , " do they come back to work or not ? " " We 're all tired now , " MacMahon replied obliquely . Again there was a long silence . Rose glanced at the faces surrounding the car and then studied the dashboard ; she felt silly and conspicuous in her white dress ; she tried to make herselflittle as she shrank down in the seat . Hagen pushed his way through the crowd . " Well , am I working here or not ? " he asked harshly . " I do n't give a damn . But I want to know . " MacMahon gave a final look of appeal to Carl before he gave in . " All right , all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to work ! I ca n't bother about all these things ! I ca n't stay here all night . " Hagen gestured toward Winters . " Is he working here ? " " Yes , yes , let it go , forget about it ! Now let 's forget about this , fellows , let 's forget about it , everybody 's tired , everybody 's upset .... " You see ? Walt thought bitterly . I told you he 'd give you a chance . The whistle blew , a weak , steam-saving blast . The crowd broke up . The young guys raced for the clock . The oldp204hands lagged behind , talking it over . They were proud ; they were excited ; some of the kids began yelling as they ran toward the factory . They had their first sure knowledge of their strength.  |p207HE  ran out to the car where Walt was waiting . " Will they ? " Walt asked . " Yes . . . . They can only ride as far as the bus line . Somebody'sgoing to meet them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , hell , " Walt said . He was standing beside the car and he gave the door a sudden hard slam . He walked a little way nervously and came back . " Why did n't you  --  " he began bitterly , but then he stopped . A car pulled out of the parking space and headed for town . " Tell them to come on , " Walt said . " We might as well . ' It 's what I get . " He went back to where Marie and Ellen were standing in the shadow of the loading platform . The crew was coming out of the factory , down the low steps , the voices rising steadily and coming back scattered as the men headed across the tideflator started down the road . He came up to Ellen , trembling inside with eagerness , and saw her watching him as he approached , looking small and frail beside Marie . " It 's over here , " he said politely . She nodded and started beside him , glancing up at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her neat little figure in her tight overalls and white shirt and of the sister walking on the far side of Ellen , silent , dim , stepping with care over the rough ground ; he thought the crew coming downp208from the time clock looked after them . " Do you know who was hurt ? " Ellen asked . He was warmed by her friendly voice and he could tell that she was only making conversation . " No , I did n't hear . " " Even Old Man MacMahon came down , " she said . " I saw him . He had some trouble , I guess . " She glanced at him . " I heard he fired your old man . . . . I heard he fired Winters and your old man and then took them back again . " He was conscious of her light walk and the rustle of her clothing . In the light from the cars and from the factory he could see the outline of her breasts under the shirt she wore . Beyond her Marie , larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to them or to what they were saying . " Yes , " Ellen said , " I 've known your old man ever since I came to work . The first day I came here I was so scared , I remember , I was working so hard and he came up and watched me  --  ' You trying to do it all ? ' he said . You think nobody else works here ? ' I felt like a little fool . " Walt was already in his car . " Here we are ! " Johnny said brightly . Then as he saw them looking at Walt he added , " We 're here because we 're here . " " Hello , girls , " Walt said with composure . " How 's every little thing ? " They hesitated . " This is Walt Connor , " he began nervously . " Maybe you heard of him . This is Ellen and Marie Turner . " He saw them glance at each other and wondered if he had it wrong , the girl 's name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . The car was an old Maxwell four-leaf clover ; the front seat folded down and to get in the back seat , the front seat had to be held out of the way . Ellen got in back and Johnny sat beside her . As Marie sat down beside Walt , Ellen explained , " We can only go as far as the highway . " " Now why ? " " Somebody 's going to meet us there . "  | " Who ? " " Somebody we know . " Walt turned around . " Oh , yeah ! " he said brightly . " Oh , yeah ! " He put his hand on Marie 's knee . " That 's what you think ! " he yelled . Marie drew away and pushed his hand off her knee , " Hi yah ! Hi yah ! " Walt yelled . " Let 's go ! " Johnny glanced at Ellen . Her face was impassive . He felt that he ought to enter into the spirit of the occasion . " Ha , ha ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great scream . " Wowie ! " They passed some of the workers walking beside the road . As they stepped off the gravel when the car passed , Walt stuck his head out the door . " Whoopee ! " he said to them . Marie sat in the corner of the seat , staring straight ahead . Ellen was watching Walt ; Johnny could see that she was frowningat him distrustfully . The ribbon tied around her head gave her a high forehead , and somehow made her seem severe ; Johnny tried to think of her the way he had when they had waited on the tideflat , but he could not do it . He felt chilled and ill at ease , and he wished that he could holler and yell cheerfullythe way Walt did . But now Walt became conscious of the lack of response in the car . He reached over and grabbed Marie around the shoulder , pulled her to him violently and kissed her . He pulled her so hard that her feet flew up and she nearly fell off the seat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What are you so gloomy about ? " Marie pushed at his face . He had to straighten up to get the car back on the road . Marie continued to push him away , with her hands under his chin . He pulled her forcibly to him . " You like that ? " he asked . But Ellen sat up in the seat and leaned forward . " Let her alone , " she said . " Pipe down in the back seat ! " Walt struggled with Marie forp210a moment . " What 's the matter , Johnny ? Ca n't you keep her busy ? " Marie braced herself and gave Walt a terrible shove . His head snapped back . He said , " Oh ! " and put his hand to his neck . For a moment , he seemed about to hit her . Then he controlled himself . " Come on , " he said . " Do n't get so hot . " Marie seemed exhausted after she freed herself . She sank back in the far corner of the seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ellen said distinctly . " Take care of your girl , Hagen ! " Walt said . " Do I have to take care of them both ? " They were silent as they rode on toward the highway . Johnny and Ellen were sitting close to each other in the narrow back seat . Their legs were touching . Ellen seemed to be satisfied that Walt was leaving Marie alone ; she sank back in the seat , and when she did so her shoulder also pressed against Johnny 's . Now Johnny wanted to start a conversation , but he did not know how to begin . He tried to think of something dirty to say , so he could get the conversation started on the right track , but he could not think of anything that seemed fitting . Besides , when he had winked at her and said that some people had a good time when the lights went out , she had not paid much attention and had not even replied . Presently he asked , " How do you like working ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you like working out there ? " Ellen looked at him " It 's wonderful , " she said . " Good God . How do you ? " Johnny felt that she was making fun of him , but he was glad to be talking anyway , " Oh , it ai n't so bad . It gets tiresome sometimes . . . I do n't mind . " He wondered if he ought to feel her up . If it had been some girl he had gone out with in high school he would have known how to act , but Ellen seemed so hard-boiled he hesitated ; he was afraid she would laugh at him . They rode the rest of thep211way to the main highway in silence . In the front seat Walt whispered to Marie and made a few ineffectual passes at her . She pushed him aside wearily , and did not answer his whisperingsexcept to say , " This is where we get out . Let us out here . " Walt stopped the car and began to argue . " Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , what 's the idea ? " " We 're going to meet somebody here , " Ellen said . She was already crowding forward past Johnny . " Who ? " " Her boy friend . " " Where is he ? He ai n't here . He wo n't show up ... . Come on . " " He 's working  --  he do n't get off till twelve . " Ellen reached past Marie and opened the door . But before Marie could get out , Walt grabbed her again and pulled her to him . He started to whisper something to her , but she pushed herself away and Ellen pulled at Walt 's shoulder , saying , " Let her alone  --  have n't you got any sense ? Grow up , will you ? " " Lay off , will you ? " Walt turned on Ellen . " Whose party is this ? Lay off before I smack you one . " Nevertheless he releasedMarie , and she climbed out of the car . As she did so she said to Ellen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got out . She slammed the door . " Thanks , Fathead , " she said . The two girls walked off toward the highway . Anothercar from the factory drew up to a stop at the edge of the pavement , hesitated while the driver looked to see what was coming , and moved out on the pavement . As Walt followed it , Johnny got a glimpse of the two girls standing beside the road , swinging their lunch pails while they waited , staring toward town for the lights of a car . Then Walt swung out on the pavement . He jammed the gear-shift lever hard as he shifted into second ; the scrape of the gears seemed to give him some satisfaction . " Little bitch , " he said forcibly . Johnnyp212climbed into the front seat . " You , " Walt said . " Why did n't you do something ? " " Me ? " " Oh , you 're nuts . Why did n't you do something . You did n't do a damn thing . You just set there . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had kept her mouth shut . " " I do n't see , " Johnny replied . " You do n't know how to handle these chippies . You got to grab them . You see how I did ? That 's the way you got to handle them . " Then Walt forgot about blaming Johnny ; he stared straight at the road , frowning restlessly , his large face twisted with disappointment . " Bitches , " he burst out . " Bitches , bitches ! " Suddenly he stopped the car at the side of the road . " Nothing passed us , " he said . Johnny did not understand . He was too humiliated by Walt 's criticism to keep up with what he said . He had been accusing himself for not having grabbed Ellen and done it to her right there in the back seat , and trying to make himself believe that the next time he would know what to do . " That was a stall , " Walt said . " Nobody 's coming for them . They just wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're smart . " Johnny still did not understand , except that he gathered that the girls had put something over on them . " Bitches , " Walt said . " Nothing 's coming . Look . " He pointed down the road . There were no headlights approaching them . " Let 's go back . But listen , Hagen . You got to do your part . Make a play for her . She 's hot for it . Anybody can see that . She 's burning up . All you have to do is get her started . She 'll come across . You see ? Use both hands . Like my girl .. . she just as good as told me she would if it was n't for her sister . " Johnny sighed . " What do you say ? " Johnny tried to picture himself grabbing Ellen and getting her worked up . He did not believe there was any sense in going back . If the girls had wanted to ride with them , he figured ,  |p213they  would n't have got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Walt 's scorn if he did not show some enthusiasm . " It 's all right with me , " he said . Walt was determined . He swung the car around in the road and stepped on it going back . " Now do something this time , " he kept saying . " Let me do the talking . Watch me . And do something . " The girls were still waiting where the road from the factory joined the highway . Most of the workers walked home across the tideflat to the poor sections near the waterfront , and only those who had cars drove to the highway . Walt slowed down so that the headlights focused on the girls for a few moments . They looked into the light ; it was obvious that they were expectingthe car ; they moved a little toward the pavement . All at once , while he watched her from the darkness of the car , Johnny thought what a good-looking girl Ellen was ; he had never realized it before . The band tied around her hair made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small and delicate ; she was frowning a little at the headlights , and her lips were partly opened as she tried to see who was in the car . Her dark blue overalls were fitted tightly around her waist and the upper part of her legs , flaring out at the cuffs to concealher shoes . She wore a red sash around her waist , and a white shirt open at the throat . The shirt fitted her loosely ; a slight breeze ruffled the cloth over her breasts . As Walt swung the car around , and the light moved away from the girls , Johnny felt himself tremble with a different kind of excitement from that he had felt before ; he felt uneasy and troubled , and when he breathed there was an empty feeling in his chest , as though he could not breathe deeply enough . " Let me do the talking , " Walt whispered . He stopped the car . The girls came over to it , unfriendly and distrustful , trying to see who was behind the windshield . " We thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walt said loudly.  |p214Neither  of them replied ; they stopped and looked disappointed . " Maybe he broke down , " Walt said . " Come on , we 'll take you on home . " " We 'll wait , " Ellen said . " Thanks . " " Come on ! Do n't be sore . I was only playing . . . have n't you got a sense of humor ? " " No . " Walt opened the door . " Get out , " he whispered . " Talk her into it . " Johnny walked uneasily over to Ellen . He could see her watching him as he approached with a frank suspicion and contempt , and a slight tremor of pain passed through him ; he wanted to tell her that he was really friendly ; he did not ever want her to look like that when she saw him . " What do you want ? " Ellen said . " Nothing ! . . . I just wanted to say . . . you know , if you want to ride home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell , you do n't want to wait here all night , do you ? " " We wo n't have to . We 'll take a chance . " Johnny agreed at once . " All right , all right ! I just wanted to say  --  you know  --  if you wanted . . . . " His voice trailed off until he was only mumbling to himself . He was vaguely aware that Walt had eased the car slowly down the pavement , and that he was talking to the other girl . Now all at once Ellen 's face became distorted and she shouted something wildly . Johnny looked around . The other girl had been standing beside the car , and Walt had dragged her across the front seat . Now she was lying sprawled out on the front seat , with one knee on the floor of the car and one foot on the running-board . Then her feet kicked in the air as Walt dragged her on inside . The car started to move . Ellen ran after it . The door remained open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the running-board as it went out of sight . A crazy thought kept going through his mind ; he thought that Marie 's feet looked surprised . Then , a long time afterwards ,  |p215he  heard the door of the car slam . In a few moments the red tail light was out of sight around a curve in the road . Ellen was standing in the middle of the road . " You bastard , " she kept saying . " Oh , you bastard , you bastard . " She turned on Johnny furiously as he approached . " Leave me alone . I 'll kill you , you hear ? I 'll kill you . " Johnny backed away . He tried to reassure himself by thinkingthat Walt would drive back to pick them up in a few minutes . But the darkness seemed intense as soon as the headlightsof the car disappeared . There were no houses or lights along the road . The brush of the tideflat grew in a solid mass on both sides of the highway , and the new pavement shone with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction , and there was no sound except a faint stirring from the brush . " I did n't do anything , " he stammered . " I swear . . . I did n't have anything to do with it . " He tried to think that Walt would not leave him out in the middle of the tideflat like this , that he would soon be back for them , that it was only a trick . . . . But he was deeply shocked ; he felt sick to think of what Ellen must think of him ; and he was ashamed for Walt , in a curious way ; he wanted Walt to do something to make it seem less bad . " I did n't ! " he repeated . " I swear to God I did n't ! " Ellen seemed to believe him . She calmed down and came back to the edge of the road . " I 'll kill him , " she whispered . " Fred will kill him . " She spoke with such venom that Johnny could imagine a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , God ! " Ellen said . " Then why do you hang around a guy like that ? " She picked up her lunch pail . She had thrown it down when she ran after the car . Very slowly Johnny realized that she was crying . The lunch pail had opened when it was dropped , and as Ellen looked for the spoon and for the cup that she carried fruit in , she kept drawing her free hand across her eyes andp216face . Johnny listened to her crying and watched her in a tighteningspasm of misery . Did n't Walt have any sense ? he wondered . Doing a thing like that ? How could he do a thing like that ? He struck a match and tried to help her . " I 'll help you , " he said , and crawled on his hands and knees holding the match close to the ground . She said brokenly , " You do n't have to . " Her voice was so bitter that Johnny closed his ears ; he was shaken and thoroughlymiserable . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a small jar with a lid , and as Johnny picked it up he noted automatically that Ellen had had raspberriesfor her lunch  --  there were a few left in the jar " Here , " he said . " Is there anything else ? " " No . That 's all . " She put the things back in her lunch bucket . She was still crying , though not so hard as she had been before ; only at times she would draw in a deep and trembling breath , and at other times Johnny could see her whole body draw up in a brief spasm of nervousness and fatigue . Her hands were trembling so much it was hard for her to fasten her lunch bucket . " They ought to shoot people like that , " she said at last . Johnny was relieved that she had controlled herself . " The damn fool , " he said . He was surprised at the anger in his own voice . They were silent for a long time . Ellen sat down , and after hesitating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside her . The dark mass of brush towered over the road . The faint , dry , summer crackling came from it as the twigs snapped and the leaves stirred . Ellen leaned forward and put her hands over her eyes and forehead . He did not dare sit very close to her , and he could not see her very clearly , he could see only the white blur of her shirt and of her arms and face . But he was moved because she seemed so distressed , and he tried to think of something to say to comfort her . He watched the road , hoping to see the headlights of Walt 's car and Walt comingp217back . The stream of pavement disappeared a short way ahead . He could see it for a little way , before the brush made a wall of shadow , and beyond it he could only see the tops of the taller bushes outlined against the sky . He shivered . It was hard to believe that town was only a few miles beyond the wall of brush . Ellen straightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " What ? " " You want a sandwich ? " After a moment , she explained , in a tired voice , " I got one left over from my lunch . I do n't want it . You can have it if you want it . " Johnny hesitated . He did not know what to say , but he was touched that she should offer him a sandwich . It was true that she had offered it indifferently , in a voice that was worn out by her crying . " Do n't you want it ? " he asked . " No . I 'm not hungry . . . . If you want it . Otherwise I 'll throw it away . " " Then I 'll eat it . " She watched him mournfully while he unwrapped the sandwichand bit into it . " How far do you live ? " " On the other side of the flat . About four miles , I guess . " Then he thought . " But it 's only about two miles to the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She sighed . " Something must have happened to Fred . But you never can depend on him . I do n't see why Marie runs around with him . He never does do what he says he will . He goes out and gets drunk and then he tells Marie he could n't get his car started . And she believes him . " " How far do you live ? " " Way on the other side of town . " They relaxed into another silence . It was growing a little cold . Johnny awakened to the fact that no cars had passed and that they had a long walk ahead of them into town , unlessp218Walt came back , and he was beginning to believe that Walt was not coming back . Even if he did ... . Ellen stood up . " We might as well get started . " They walked slowly down the deserted road . Now Johnny felt let-down and tired ; every time his feet came down on the pavement he felt it all the way up his spine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had played on them . All sorts of confused memories kept crowding into his mind ; it seemed that days had passed since he had gone running through the factory , and days since Walt had come up to him and greeted him like a fraternity brother  --  a fine fraternity brother he turned out to be !  --  and the girl in the white dress and the boy in evening clothes had nestled down in the big car while they watched the accident , and his father had been in some sort of fuss . It was too much ; Johnny could not grasp it all . No cars passed them . The great banks of brush on both sides of the road rustled in the darkness , and when they spoke their voices sounded loud and unearthly . Johnny felt a tugging despondencythe longer they walked  --  how could anybody do such a thing ? How could anybody be so mean ? " If he hurts her , " Ellen said , " I 'll kill him . " She was stumbling a little . Her white shirt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's sick , " she went on . " She just got out of the hospital . " " Oh ! " Johnny said . " Yes . " Hospital , he repeated silently . " Nobody could ever treat me the way Fred treats her . He says he 'll come after her and then half the time he do n't show up . He 's always got some good excuse . . . . If anybody ever did to me , " she said threateningly , " what he did to her , I 'd kill him . " The threat in her voice was so live and real that he thought it was intended for him.  | " What did he do to her ? " " First he knocked her up , " Ellen said . " Then after he raised fifty dollars for an abortion he lost thirty-five dollars on a punch board trying to win a twenty-dollar gold piece so he 'd have the rest of it . So she had to raise the money from a guy she used to work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was supposed to because she was afraid Carl would fire her if she did n't . That 's why I despise him , " Ellen said . " Do you blame me ? " " No . " " If you ever tell anybody , " she said abruptly , " if you ever tell anybody I told you , I 'll kill you . ' " I wo n't tell anybody . " " If you ever do . " They walked along m silence . " God Almighty ! " Johnny cried . " Now what do you think ? " " God . " " Now , " Ellen said , " why do you hang around a rat like that ? " " I do n't know . " The lights of a car opened in the road ahead of them . She stepped out into the light . The car stopped ; he heard the voices and the sliding brakes . The car turned around heavily , backingacross the wide pavement , starting and stopping before it headed the way they were going and drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , a seven-passenger Chandler , and the motor knocked so loudly that Ellen had to shout to be heard . Great waves of brown smoke poured out of the hood when it stopped . " Where 's Marie ? " a voice called down . " You ! " Ellen shouted back . " What happened to you ! " " I could n't get it started ! Where 's Marie ? " " Get on in back , " Ellen told him . Ellen got in the front seat . Two young fellows sitting in back moved over to make room for him . He could feel themp220watching him inquisitively . There were two more in the front seat , a tall fellow sitting behind the steering wheel , and a boy who stood up so Ellen could slide in between them . He heard Ellen explaining what had happened . The tall driver began to curse . He turned around and spoke to the two in the back . " You hear that ? " he demanded incredulously . " Some son of a bitch ran off with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who was it ? " Ellen asked Johnny , " What 's his name ? " " Walt Connor . " One of the voices said , " I know him . I know who he is . Football player . Remember ? " There was a moment of silence . The driver said , almost in awe , " I 'll kill the son of a bitch . I 'll murder him . " He turned to Johnny again . " Who the hell is that ? " " Nobody . He came out with me . " " What 's he doing here ? " " You want him to walk home ? It ai n't his fault . It 's your fault . It 's your fault . If your car wo n't run you ought to start earlier . " " Which way did he go ? " " Toward town . " They started out , the car lurching heavily and the gears grinding as they got under way . He sank back against the torn upholstery . One of the men in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's a side road down here a ways ! Maybe he turned in there ! " He sat back beside Johnny . " What a rat , " he said . " What a rat that guy must be . You want a drink ? " " What ? " The man handed him a flask . He took a small sip out of it and handed it back . The man leaned over and tapped Ellen on the shoulder . " What ? "  | " Here 's a drink . " Ellen took the bottle and threw it out into the brush . It broke . " Why you why you , " the man said . " You little devil . " The car turned off the pavement and dove into a dirt road . The brush slapped against the side of the car . " Fred ! " the manshouted . " She threw away my bottle . " " I have n't got any time to pay attention to you , " the drivershouted back . " I 'm looking for the guy that run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to beat the Jesus out of him . " From the far side of the car a voice said , " Where 's Marie ? " " A guy run off with her . " " Run off with her ? " " Yeah . " " Where are we ? " the voice said . " I have n't got any time to monkey with any bottle , " the driver called back . " I 'm going to find the son of a bitch that run off with my girl and beat him up . " " This is a private road , " somebody said . " I saw a sign back there . " The man beside Johnny sank back in the seat . " Did you see that ? " he asked . " That little devil threw out that whole big bottle . " The car bounced over the private road . " When I catch him , " the driver called back , " I 'll tear off his arms and beat him with the bloody stumps . " " Oh , shut up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , why 'd you throw away my bottle ? " They stopped . The road ended . In a cleared space they saw a house brightly lighted and a crowd of people dressed in eveningclothes on the lawn . There was a little group standing togethersome distance from the front porch , and as they stopped the group scattered , the people ran back toward the house and there was a loud shouting . Sparks began to fly at the place where they had been . They heard a loud whish like a sound of a safety valve popping off ; a broad stream of fire climbedp222into the sky , mounted straight up , dropped and exploded and great globes of colored light dotted the air . " I told you this was a private road , " a voice said . " I read it on a sign back there . " " Turn around , " Ellen said dully . " Go on home and wait there . He 'll have to take her home . Anyway . "  |p223HE  bore down as hard as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he drew her up on the seat . He reached over her and pulled the door shut , sensing the car edging off the road , jerking it back wildly with one hand while he closed the door against the wind . The steering wheel was firm and responsive and as the car gained speed he whipped it back and forth for no reason , only to feel it under his control . The girl pushed at him . He heard her saying , " What do you think you are ? " in a dull weak voice . He put his arm around her and pressed her so tightly that she could not speak . His hand went under her arm and closed over her full breast . He was consciousof her kicking awkwardly at his feet and pulling at his hand on her breast with her free hand . This is a good old car , he thought feverishly . This is a good old car . " You know how fast we 're going ? " he asked her . Her mouth was pressed against his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free her head . The pavement opened up ahead , wide and free and safe . At the turns he swung it around lightly , proud of the feeling of power as the car responded with his one hand on the wheel . She stopped struggling but her body was still tense and watchful . " You 're not fooling me , " he said . He felt himself grinningat the pavement that opened up before the headlights . They 're not fooling me , he told the pavement . They 're not putting anything over on me . Under his hand her breast was soft and pliant and he molded it tenderly . Her legs werep224awkwardly spread , and he glanced down , smiling at their funny position , one knee clamped around the gear shift and the emergency brake and one leg half drawn up on the seat ; he could and her hips swelled against where the cloth pressed tightly . Do n't worry , he thought tenderly . I 'll work you up . I would n't hurt you . The road branched and he turned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I have to shift , I 'll have to let her go . Now she was lying tense and flexible , ready to free herself if his hold weakened . You are n't fooling me , he said silently . Do n't think you are . He said to Winters and all the men , you 're not putting anything over on me , and , to the goofy Polack , I know what you 're up to . The car climbed the first hills and shot out on the level ground of the first suburbs . There were lights in some of the houses and there were a few scattered street lights , so he turned still higher , giving it all it would take , skidding in the loose gravel so he would not have to shift . Here . He turned off the road and switched off the motor and the lights . His hands were sweaty . For a moment he sat motionless while the motor creaked into silence . She made an ineffectual struggle . " I wo n't hurt you , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Still pressing her firmly against his shoulder he bent his head over hers , smelling her rich hair , barely moving his lips as he whispered , " I 've been watching you for a long time . Ever since I came to work . Do n't be afraid of me . I would n't hurt you . I would n't hurt you for anything . " She made a brief convulsive struggle . He began to caress her gently , gently , barely letting his hand move over her breast and her thigh while he murmured , " I did n't mean to be rough . But I did n't want those kids along . And I did n't want to argue . Do you understand ?  |p225Can  you hear me ? " She relaxed ; he could feel her growing lax and waiting under his hand and his murmuring voice , and he tried to move slightly toward her while his hand fumbled with the belt of her overalls . " You 're a God-damn fool , " she said distinctly . He tried to kiss her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how hard he pressed her they stayed clamped shut and she pulled her head away . Her feet kicked at his legs and her free hand beat on his side , tried to reach his face unless he warded it off with his upper arm . " I 'm sorry I was rough , " he said . " I did n't mean to hurt you . You understand ? I would n't hurt you for anything . Do you think I would ? Why should I ? " She gasped , " Well let me breathe then . Let me get my breath . You 're choking me . " He released her . She breathed deeply and put her hand on her mouth . " You nut , " she said shakily . " Of all the nuts . " " I 'm sorry , Marie . I did n't mean to hurt you . But I did n't . " " What 's the matter with you ? What do you want , anyway ? " He put his arm around her again and tried to draw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , " Oh , of all the nuts , of all the nuts . " He kissed her unyielding mouth but when he put his hand on her she began to scream , over and over , while he tried to kiss her to stop her and she kept on screaming , the crazy sound splitting his ears . I 'll stop ! he yelled , I 'll stop ! She kept on screaming and he looked around in terror at the dark road and started the car to drown out the sound . Then he drove away , imagining the people running from the scattered houses on the hill , shouting I 've stopped ! I 'll leave you alone ! until at last she stopped screaming and began to cry , rocking back and forth on the seat with her hands over her face . He drove up and down the hills for a long time until she calmed down . Then she sat back in the corner of the seat with her eyes closed and her face pale and exhausted .  |p226Gradually  he calmed down . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own shaken breathing . " I 'm sorry , " he said at last . " I did n't think . " She did not open her eyes . " Take me home , " she said . " I 'm sick . " " Where do you live ? " " On Hume . At the corner of Nestle . " He turned back obediently . " I 'm sorry , " he repeated desperately . " You hear me ? I did n't mean . But I get sick of it . I been there a year now . I do n't know a soul . If they get it in for you . . . and they never give me a chance . They never give me a chance . I been there a year now and I do n't know a soul . I 've seen you there ever since I been there and I thought . I did n't mean . I did n't want to hurt you . " " Yes , " she said . She looked at him . " You got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life had gone out of him ; he felt her watching him and he turned the car toward town .  | THEY drove through the main streets to the shadowed districtnear the waterfront . There were still the remnants of the crowds downtown , left like the burnt-out firecrackers that littered the streets ; there were a few groups clustered before the all-night restaurants and in front of the hotels ; there were a few drunks sitting on the curb tossing firecrackers out into the street , and an irregular crackling came from all parts of town . There was a strong smell of burnt explosives in the air . A few cars darted through the empty streets . They looked small and lost , like insects racing across a tile floor . Out in the dark neighborhood where Ellen lived there were bands of sailors scattered along the sidewalks , and when the car stopped , out of the light of a street lamp on the corner , Johnny could see the whore houses on the waterfront lighted up and hear the occasionalracket from them . This was where Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , between a store building on the corner and a whore house on the other side . The windows of the store were boarded over and there were large advertisements for cigarettes pasted on the boards . Behind the Turner house the gas tanks were outlined against the reflected light from the main part of town . Most of the time they waited in silence . Occasionally one of the men stirred to light a cigarette . The car creaked mysteriouslyfrom time to time as the engine cooled . Johnny could see Ellen 's head outlined against the street lamp . The othersp228were lying back relaxed and waiting , but she sat stiffly upright , watching for the lights of a car to appear on the darkened street . Johnny came to life again , and felt excited and alert . Whenever a car passed the house his heart began to pound and he found himself hoping feverishly that Walt would have sense enough to drive right away . . . . People passed on the sidewalk beside the car , so close that he could reach out and touch them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without knowing that there were people sitting in it who could hear every word they said . A man dressed in a bright pink suit , with green trimmings on the sleeves and green stripes down the trousers , stopped under the street light and looked all around , trying to get his bearings . He carried a large fat horn coiled around his arm like a snake , and when he stopped he took off his hat  --  it was a tall fuzzy hat shaped like a watermelon  --  andran a handkerchief over his bald head . Then he sighed and walked unsteadily toward the center of town . " He 's taking his time , " the driver said . No one answered him . " Let me take care of him , " the driver said . " I 'll take care of him . Only watch he do n't try to swing a jack or anything . I 'll handle him . " " You 'll do wonders , " Ellen said . " You think I wo n't ? " " Well do n't brag so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out and got us there would n't be any trouble . " " I told you I could n't get it started . " " You never can get it started . . . . Why do n't you start trying earlier if you know it wo n't start ? " " Shut up , " someone said . A car approached . Johnny waited , in an almost unbearable tension ; he could imagine the men rushing for Walt , pulling him out of the car and pounding his face in ; he could imagine Walt struggling as the four of them jumped on him . And maybe Walt had just turned around and gone back and wasp229still looking for them . . . . The car passed . The men sank back , and Johnny drew a deep breath of relief . Then he saw another car , coming in close behind the first , hidden behind it , stop before the house . Before he knew it he was out of the car and racing down the street . " Do n't stop ! " he yelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the running-board of Walt 's car ; he saw Walt stare at him with his face stiff with surprise ; and then , as the others began to climb out of the car and to run down the street toward them , Walt 's car lurched ahead , speeded up in second , and sailed over the uneven pavement . He fumbled at the door and climbed inside . Walt was looking back to see what was coming . He looked frightened and bewildered ; he kept looking from the road ahead , to Johnny , and then back through the rear window . Marie was slouched down in the front seat between them . Johnny had to push her over to make room for himself . " What is it ? " Walt said . " Four of them . . . they 'll beat you up . They been waiting for you . " Johnny could not get his breath to explain any more . He leaned back , breathing hard and trembling . Walt bore down on the accelerator and the car jerked ahead . Then Marie raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . Walt did not answer her . Looking back , Johnny could see the dim , flickering headlights of the car . He felt reassured . It could never catch them . He felt a thrill of pride that Walt 's car could make such time . " They came a little while after you left , " he said , breathlessly . " They been waiting . " " How many of them ? " " Four of them . " Marie pushed weakly at Johnny . " I 'm sick , " she said . " Let me out . " " Are they in sight ? "  |p230Johnny  looked back . He could still see the headlights , but now they were dim , and looked like only one light . " Just barely in sight , " he said . Walt swung the car to miss a hole in the pavement . " They 'll never catch us ! " he shouted . " This old hack can make time ! " " Let me out , " Marie said . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning against Johnny and reaching over him . Walt slowed down and glanced back . Then he swung the car to the side of the road . They were beside a mill yard ; there was a high board fence running beside the road for two blocks . Walt said sharply , " All right . Let her out . " He stopped the car . Johnny fumbled nervously with the door handle . His hand slipped from it as he pressed on it . " Pull up ! you God-damn fool ! " Walt shoved him viciously and opened the door . Johnny tried to stand on the running-board as Marie got out , but she fell forward and he stepped down to grab her . He saw Walt lookingback through the rear window as he stepped down . Then all at once , as he held Marie , the light disappeared and Walt 's car went sailing down the road . He started to run after it . He ran a hundred feet before he heard the door slam shut and understood that Walt was leaving him there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He thought of running away from the road , but the darknesstripped him and he fell down as soon as he left the pavement . In an agony of fear he tried to hide in the brush beside the road , but he could feel that the bushes were not high enough to conceal him . For a few moments he scrambled through the brush , sometimes half running and sometimes crawling on his hands and knees . Then his head cleared . He got back on the pavement and walked back to Marie . She was sick ; he could see her vaguely against the wall and hear the terrible gasping sounds as she vomited . The car bore down on them . He waited for them to jump on him . He saw them climbing out of thep231car , and saw Ellen brush past him to run to Marie . He heard their confused shouts , and thought of how much noise the car made ; it shook all over as the motor idled , and the smoke and steam floated up around the hood . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he go ? " somebody shouted at him . " Where 'd he go . " He was conscious of pointing down the road and of thinking what a foolish question . Then , somehow , he was back in the car , and it was racing down the road again . For a long time no one said anything . The wind beating on his face revived him . As his heart slowed down he leaned forward , his hands clenched and his feet bearing down hard against the floor boards , trying to make the car go faster . He thought of what he would do when they caught Walt . He pictured Walt lying on the ground and himself running at him and jumping on him with both feet . In the darkness one of the men slapped him hard across the face . Johnny swung back blindly . " You little bastard ! " the man said . " What 'd you do it for ? Why 'd you tell him ? " His voice sounded baffled and disapproving , as though he were disappointed in Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another voice said , " Left you there ! What a rat ! " Johnny was too choked to answer . He felt impotent because the car moved so slowly . It shook and rattled ; the top flopped in the wind , and it made a lot of noise , but gradually he realized that it was not going very fast . " We 'll never catch him ! " he shouted . The words burst from him . He was almost crying . " We 'll never catch him ! We 'll never catch him ! " The car stopped . The driver turned back to Johnny . " Where does he live ? " Ellen and Marie were in the front seat . Ellen said , " Take her home . You can find him afterwards . " " Where does he live ? " " I do n't know . " " Fred , " Ellen said , " use some sense . Take her home . She has to go home . "  | " Do n't lie . You do know . I 'll knock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell you if I knew ! You think I would n't tell you ! I wish to God I did know . I wish to God I could get ahold of him . " " Shut up ! " Ellen said . " Take us home ! You hear me ! " " Well , why did you tell him then ? We would have had him if you had n't told him ! " " I , " Johnny said . But he could not defend himself . " I 'll never do that again . The bastard . " " You should n't have done it the first time . " Ellen said , " Fred . " She jerked at his arm . " You listen to me . You hear ? Take us home . Who are you thinking about ? She 's got to get home ! You can take care of him ! Some other time ! " They drove back to the house . When they got there Fred turned on Johnny again . He got out of the car and stood besideJohnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Anyway . " But Ellen said wearily , " Oh , let him alone . He 's harmless . He 's just dumb ! " Johnny stood uncertainly on the sidewalk , watching Marie get out of the car . Fred and Ellen walked with her as they went on toward the house . One of the men came over beside him and lit a cigarette . " You better beat it , kid , " he said . " He 's liable to beat the Jesus out of you if he has to see you much longer . " Johnny nodded dully and started off in the general direction of home . All sorts of dizzy ideas flashed through his mind . He was tired ; he was almost trembling with his weariness . Ellen 's indifferent defense of him . Let him alone . He 's harmless . He 's just dumb ! Oh , how bitterly it shamed him ! He could not rest , he could not put it out of his mind , he could not forget it any more than he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not dismiss it , for whenever he thought to console himself , She 's just a little chippy , she 's just a little Polack , he remembered her crying by the roadside and the wayp233she looked under the light of the car , and he remembered Walt driving away like a bat out of hell and the blindness of his own terror and bewilderment . When he thought of his betrayal it was not hatred for Walt that moved him , but revulsion , a deep and sickened shame for mankind , an emotion more powerfulthan any he had ever known . Some day I 'll tell him , he thought . Some day I 'll pay him back , and he stumbled on home through the littered streets . They let me off easy , he thought . They should have beat me up . He awakened painfully , hearing voices inside the house and the fitful cries of the children in the yard , his body heavy with sleep and his head thick with the dreams that had tormented him all night . The shade on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom ; the window was up and the light came in hot and unsparing , lighting up the torn and spotted wall paper , the door frame that did not fit tightly into the wall , the little cloudy balls of dust under the other bed . He opened his eyes and brooded on these marks that lay like the wounds of poverty on the room , turning his eyes slowly from the sagging ceiling to the disordered covers on the other bed , where his younger brother slept ; he closed his eyes again and tried to go back to sleep . He could feel the glaze of sweat on his cheeks . Noon . Outside he heard the sunlight drying the world , the sounds weighed down in the heat and going only a little way in the thick and windless air . One of the children cried out in the house . There was a fervent hushing sound , and he could imagine his mother or his sister whispering fiercely , " Be quiet ! Johnny 's asleep ! " and the children drawing in their breaths in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shame at having spoken loudly by warning the others as they crept outside . Misery . The house was crowded . For a month his sisterp234and her husband and their two children had been there , doubling up the beds in the small rooms , his brother coming into his room , the two children upstairs , his sister and her husband sleeping on the cot in the front room . There were always beds that had not been made and somebody was always sleeping in the house . When he came in at night he had to creep past the bed where his sister and her husband slept . Sometimes they were awake and spoke to him , and he answered them briefly , in embarrassment , as he sidled quickly to his door and closed it behind him . When they were not awake when he got in from work he also felt uncomfortable at going through their room , seeing the two figures beneath the covers , feeling that he had intruded on them while they slept ; sometimes , before he went to sleep , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them getting up and moving secretly through the dark house and returning , more passionate whispers and a dim stirring in the darkness before the silence settled again . For a time he kept thinking it was Sunday because of the stillness , and then he remembered that it was the Fourth , remembering the rockets swarming through the sky last night , the memory bringing all the nightmare rushing back upon him . He turned toward the wall and closed his eyes , trying to make it dark , whispering to himself , It 's night , it 's dark outside , and trying to make himself sleep . Down the street , somewhere , a few firecrackers rattled , somebody setting off the last of a package , and he pictured the kids gathering in little groups all through the district , hoarding each cracker , their hearts sinking at the ones that did n't explode , saving each one that did n't explode to break it and make a sizzler out of it later on when all the good ones were gone . In the kitchen his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound of her voice when she spoke to his sister . Mildred was always washing the kids ' clothes , usually on the back porch , or going out into the back yard to hang them on the network of lines ,  |p235|pinning  the damp garments up with strong sure movements , calling out , " Johnny , help me carry this ! " when there was a tub to be emptied , or " Johnny , will you see what 's the matter with Little Mildred ? " when she was busy and the children were complaining . He listened ; he could hear the steady mechanicalsounds as she bore down on the clothes , the pauses when she dipped them into the soapy water , the casual words she called out to her mother or her husband in the house . Sometimes he heard his father 's heavy voice and the smooth salesman 's voice of his brother-in-law , the rustle of newspapers , the sound of heavier footsteps inside . Once in a while a car passed the house . For an instant he thought of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking it easy , listening to the hum of the waves , in the sand at the beach or lying out in some cool place in the mountains  --  I wish we had a car , he thought , and he tried to make himself think of all the places he wanted to go . It was no use . His arms and legs were stiff and tired . Even if he did not move a dull ache spread over his shoulders . The flies moved heavily around his head ; he could hear them drawingnear , lighting somewhere on the bedclothes , waiting to light on his face and hands , flying away when he stirred or breathed deeply . When he opened his eyes he saw one on the pillow only a few inches from his face , drawing itself together ready to fly if frightened . It moved in little spasmodic jerks across the pillow , hesitating before lighting on his open palm , and he whispered silently , You have n't got nerve enough , while it paused , turned around and around , and leaped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door of the car and drivingoff , and twisted in sudden anguish . Do you know what I 'd do if I had a car ? he asked himself . He tried to think of all the good places he could remember , the stretch of wide beach just this side of Point No Point , thewidest and smoothest beach in the world where at low tidep236the wet sand was harder than pavement and you could hold a car wide open for an hour without having to steer it , the opening in the mountains near the Indian reservation where the river came out black and silent , and all the good places up near the headwaters of the Humptulips and the resorts in the mountains where the neat little houses were built right down to the water with the rowboats and canoes tied to their front porches . But it was no use , and more and more he rememberedwhat had happened , until at last he was wide awake , thinking back over the whole night , remembering all the things he should n't have said and should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself or trying to make excuses . He remembered from the beginning when the lights went out until the time he stumbled across town home , bruised and shamed and sick as a dog over the way it had turned out . And what would they think of him ? What would Ellen think of him ? He remembered her standing under the lights of the car when they drove back , just before Walt drove off with Marie ; he remembered the waiting , questioning look on her face and the disappointment when she saw who it was , and then her voice when she said Let him alone . He 's harmless . He 's just dumb . Now he would have to go back to work and see them all again , and he tried to think of how they would act , how Walt would face him and what he would say . He imagined himself going into the factory , listening silently while Walt tried to explain , listening with a scorn too deep for words , and that was nice to think about , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weeds after Walt drove off , running around in circles as blindly and madly as he might have run if someone had thrown acid into his eyes . Ah , how could anybody ? They ought to shoot people like that , Ellen had said . They should n't let them live . Now he thought of the shock he had got when he first talked to Ellen and had seen , without thinking about it , that she was tired , and worried as much as his mother or Mildred or any/body else he knew , and in all that he had heard about Ellen and Marie he had never thought about their being tired or worried or anything like it ; he had only thought about their running around all over hell and getting drunk all the time and being screwed by everybody and his brother . Let him alone , he 's just dumb  --  that 's what she meant , he thought , and she 's right . Suddenly his brother-in-law 's voice came clearly from beyond the door , " It 's the richest community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still asleep . " " What ? " He heard them murmuring . " I 'm awake , " he called . His voice was thick ; his tongue felt dry and swollen . His sister opened the door and looked at him . " What happened to you ? " she asked . Her hair was pushed back from her forehead and her face was flushed because she had been working ; she looked at him , friendly and malicious , hesitating about saying anything about the time he came in . He could see that she was going to tease him about it , as she sometimes teased him , amused at his discomfort , when he came home and they were still awake ; she would lie beside her husband and ask him one stupid question after another , merely to keep him in the room when she knew he was embarrassed and wanted to get away . One of these times , after he had escaped , he heard her giggling to Gerald , " He 's so funny . He must think we do it all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him alone . " Now some look on his face , some look of expectancy or shame stopped her . She looked ill at ease , suddenly , as she said , " You 'd better get up if you want anything to eat . " The voices rose stronger in the other room now that they knew he was awake . He dressed and went out into the kitchen for his breakfast , stupid with having slept in the hot room , waiting for them to torment him . At the window in the corner his father sat staring intently at the bills grouped on the table before him . His spectacles and his stiff Sunday clothes madep238him look unfamiliar , like a postmaster or a druggist , and as he read he tipped his head back and looked out through the bottom of his glasses . Gerald , sitting in the open window , cool and shaved , nodded to him brightly when he came in . He could see them waiting to ask him what had happened and where he had been , why he had got home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first moment passed and no one said anything he saw that they were going to leave him alone . Mildred was out on the back porch again . When he came out of the bathroom his mother had put out his breakfast , two pieces of toast and his coffee , glancing at him apologetically when he sat down . Still they had said nothing and he had not spoken to them . " As I was saying , " Gerald said to his father , " You got no conception of the wealth of Santa Barbara . You have to see it to realize it . A million dollars there do n't mean a thing . I forget who it was said lately there were more multimillionaires to the square mile in Santa Barbara than for any similiar area on the face of the globe . Arthur Brisbane , I expect . " Gerald leaned over and ran his finger around the edge of his oxford . His golf socks sagged somewhat around his legs and the creases bulged out above his shoes . He tugged at his golf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the window , leaning back while he pulled at the socks until the checks were even and the lines were straight on his legs . His legs in the bright checked socks looked funny ; they bulged oddly at the calves and looked like tenpins set upside down . Mildred stopped at the door . " Pop looks funny in his glasses , " she said . He looked up . " You look funny in your glasses , " she told him . In reply he waved the light bill . " Two-eighty , " he said . " You know we use a hell of a lot of light around here . " Johnny picked up a folder that came with the light hill . It was a large pamphlet , printed in three colors on smooth paper ,  |p238and  was filled with pictures and a story of the history of light . " Primitive man , " he read , " lighted his cave with the fitful glow from an open fire . " There was a picture of a group of cave men gathered around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whale-oil lamps and kerosene and gas lights until he came to modern lighting , feeling a little rise of satisfaction that everything had turned out all right , and people no longer had the trouble lighting their houses that primitive man had . Inside the pamphlet was another folder that opened out like a map , and inside it were printed cards reading Do n't strain your eyes ! Use more light ! He read them carefully . Are your children cross and fretful ? Do you suffer from headaches ? One picture showed a group of puny , undersized childrentrying to read in a dark room , their foreheads wrinkled with eyestrain and looks of anguish on their features . Mumsie , my head hurts so ! In the next picture the room was well lighted and the children were smiling happily . They had put on weight , too , and their clothes were better . Use more light , he read . It pays in the long run . That 's true , he thought . People should n't try to read if they have n't got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being interrupted , " That 's why it 's such a good place for a decent agency . All the swell dress shops from Paris and London and New York  --  they 've all got branches there . We got inside information about two months ago . All the old buildings are going out . The real-estate men got their own council now and there 's going to be standardized specifications , minimum requirements for residences and shops or commercial buildings and uniform , California-Spanish style architecture that 's going to make it the most beautiful city in the world  --  there wo n't be a place that can come up to it as far as ordinary beauty is concerned . The earthquake is the best thing that could have happened to Santa Barbara , " Gerald said earnestly . Hagen nodded politely , looking at Gerald and then at hisp240son before he turned back to the bills . Gerald was absorbed in his thoughts , staring at the floor and frowning as he thought of the wealth in Santa Barbara . " Two-eighty , " his father repeated . " Whew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he saw her frown at his father , moving her head toward the porch where Mildred was with a swift , warning gesture , a look that had become familiar in the past month  --  he understood that she was warning his father not to complain about the bills because it made Mildred feel bad when he did . He drank his coffee , trying to turn his mind away from their troubles , away from all the hurt feelings and the memory of the times when Mildred and Gerald quarreled , when Mildred said he could get work if he only would . His mother always moved in swiftly , seeing some unpleasantness coming up beforeanyone else sensed it , warning anyone who spoke carelesslyof the discomforts of being all cramped together , trying to keep Gerald and Mildred from feeling unwelcome . He looked at the folders again , at the stupefied faces of the people in the last picture , when they finally had enough light , but he could not free his mind of family troubles , for his memories of the times when Mildred had cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , at that , " his father said loudly , " it 's less than it was last month . " " We certainly do n't waste it , " his mother said . " I do n't see how they get it , " Hagen said . " They 've got them college kids reading meters and I do n't think they can even read . " Gerald waited until they had finished . " When I think of everything opening up there I think maybe I was foolish not to stay on on a commission basis , " he said . " Erickson wanted me to . I may be a damn fool , I told him , but I 'm not that kind of a fool . I know what happens when a man tries to play that game . " He paused and looked at them defiantly . " What happens ? Well , a man gets over-anxious and he drives a clientp241away ; he starts economizing on little things , you know , he wears a shirt another day , he do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigars and he begins to figure he ca n't spare the money for lunch so he gets out of touch with the other men . . . . " A look of pain crossed his smooth face . Johnny listened , moved by the decay that Gerald pictured , wondering dully at the sad figure of the man who went down and down , economizing more and more , his shoes growing less polished , his shirts dirtier and his suits more ragged , until at last the very thought of him trying to sell real estate was a horrible mockery . And Gerald too was moved as he spoke , his voice rising faintly with the pain his words gave him ; " I know that game ! " he cried , " I know how a man feels ! He gets so he do n't want to take a prospect out to some property he 's sure the prospect do n't want , and the prospect thinks he 's trying to put somethingover on him and he gets suspicious and then it 's the same old story all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out passionately . " I told him , I said , I 'm too good a salesman myself to take that old gold brick off your hands ! " But then in a moment he had quieted again , and shook his head doubtfully , making a nervous salesman motion when he talked . " What did I stand to lose ? When a man 's starting out it 's different . But when so much is opening up , why take a chance ? Erickson knows it . He knows there 's nobody in California knows that Santa Barbara real-estate field the way I know it . And I told him : By fall , I said , you 'll see the biggest building program Santa Barbara 's ever known . You 'll see five buyers for every vacant lot . You 'll see real-estate values surpassing your wildest dreams within two blocks of this office . I 'll stake my life on it . If I had ten thousand dollars I 'd grab every lease I could lay my hands on . It would pay you to hold every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect a penny of rent for a year . " Johnny looked up , stirred and impressed at the passionate voice and the surge of conviction behind it . Gerald waved hisp242hand in an abrupt gesture at the close of every sentence . He clamped his lips shut and frowned . Suddenly he got up and walked out on the back porch and down into the yard . His mother watched him , a little apprehensively , as he walked out . She said to his father , " You ought to listen to him . " " I do . " " No . . . . You ought to listen . " " By God , " his father said . " You know a light bill of twoeighty . . . . A dollar for water . " " He 'll be here tomorrow . " " Who ? " " The light man . " " How much did we pay in June ? " " A dollar . It was two-ten and I paid a dollar . " " Three-ninety , " his father said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's a hell of a lot of money to pay for lights . " He looked at Johnny sharply from behind his glasses , and as Johnny looked away , after his first fear that something was going to be said about his getting in so late , he understood that in some dim way his father was bringing up the quarrel with Carl the night before , trying to see if he understood how serious it was and how close he was to not having a job . The thought tightened him . He glanced back at his father , seeing the heavy , expressionless features , the round head under the thinning fringe of hair , the eyes hard and questioning behind the thick glasses . Almost to his own surprise he asked softly , " How is that man ? The one who was hurt ? " not understanding that he wanted to let his father know what was in his mind until his father answered him quietly , saying that he had not heard . He drank the rest of his coffee , his mouth puckering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to all that had happened the night before , paying no attention as they talked over the bills and the little money to pay them . He heard his mother 's plaintive voice , and answered her , No , when she asked if he was still hungry ,  |p243but  the emotions that had begun to stir in him were too powerfulto let him think about their troubles and he wanted to get out of the house where he could think about his own . Now he was afraid of his father 's questioning him any more , howeverindirectly , about his fight with Carl and the danger of his being fired , for he did not know how to answer and the thought was too troubling to be faced . At one moment he felt a cold resentment at his father for getting into trouble when they were so hard up , and he felt hard and contemptuous because his father could not provide for them after all this time he had worked , but at the next moment he was stirred because his father talked back to Carl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many bills they had , and at these moments he felt in on something intense and adult and mysterious , ready for anything for the few moments before his excitement cooled . These were the moments when he thought of getting back at Walt in some way , doing something , making Walt see how much he despised him , yes , and maybe Ellen somewhere around seeing it  --  the thought made him glow inside , until he checked himself : You 're dumb , you 'll never do anything , and the misery held him again . He would not have gone outside , or downtown under the pretext of watching the parade , if the kids had not come runningthrough the house and interrupted him whenever he tried to think back on what had happened and to decide what he ought to do . He would have stayed in the house , in spite of the heat , in spite of his heavy head , if they had only left him alone , if Mildred and Gerald had not started quarreling , if Mildred had not started tormenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn in the outside world that had grown inexplicableand dangerous . But they gave him no peace . Little Mildred came running into the room , screaming " Make him stop ! Make him stop ! " and Mildred answered from upstairs , " Little Gerald ! Stop teasing Little Mildred ! " though Little Gerald was not even around . He sat back , holding a paper outp244in front of him , watching his niece with intense hostility while she shouted to her mother upstairs and then to her brother in the yard . Mildred had dressed her daughter in a stiff dress that stuck out all around her like a bell , and had fixed her hair in artificial-looking curls so that everybody said she looked like a little doll , and now , as she called to her mother in her piercing voice , whirling around and around as she pretended to be hurt , he watched her with a smothered loathing and told himself that little kids were vicious . She knew that he hated her ; she knew that she got on his nerves ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slyly and triumphantly and prepare to scream again . When Gerald and Mildred first moved into the house she had pestered him once until he put her out of the room . That was the first sign of what it would mean to have them there . When he closed the door she had dropped over backwards and screamed that he had pushed her , lying on the floor and kicking and screaming until his mother and Mildred both bore down on him in fury . Now Little Gerald came in , shouting over and over , " I was n't teasingher ! Mama ! I was n't ! " " Well , stop it ! " He went out on the back porch . The air was dull with smoke from the fires . He stayed on the porch for a while , but there too there was no escape , for in the kitchen Mildred turned on Gerald while he was talking , saying , " Give Santa Barbara a rest . " " What did I say ? " " Well , we heard all that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said bitterly , " I ca n't even carry on a conversation . " " I do n't care . But you do n't have to keep harping on it . You know you could n't make a living there . " " I made a good living there for seven years . " " But you ca n't now ! You ca n't any more ! So why wo n't you admit it ? "  |p245He  waited uncomfortably , sorry for Gerald and thinking that Mildred ought to leave him alone . But Gerald said abruptly , " The Jews ruined Santa Barbara . It takes a Jew to beat a Jew . If I was a Jew I 'd be making a good living now . " " Why ? " " Because I would . Because they stick up for each other ... . Did you ever see a poor Jew ? " " Yes . " " Where ? " " Oh , Lord , " Mildred said . " You do n't know what you 're talking about . " " I know the Jews ruined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did ! " Gerald cried . " They came in and they grabbed off all the high-income property and nobody else can close a lease ! Do you think I 've got eyes ? They got control of all the banks and they got control of all the newspapers and I hope you wo n't tell me they have n't got control of all the movies ! You wo n't deny that , will you ? You wo n't deny they got control of all the movies , will you ? " His voice rose passionately . " You ca n't beat them ! They 've got their fingers in everything ! I know ! I 've done business with them ! To me there 's nothing lower than a Jew unless it 's a Filipino or a Jap or a nigger , and I 've done business with all of them ! " " You do n't have to yell ! " " You 'd yell if you knew what I know about the Jews . " " Oh , Mother of God , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Condon say ? " " That old faker , " she said . " He 's a Catholic priest ! " " I do n't care if he is ! He 's crazy and everybody knows it ! " Gerald said in disgust , " It 's no use arguing with you . " He heard Gerald starting for the porch , and slipped downaround the corner of the house . Now he did not know wherep246to go . In front of the house the kids were planting their firecrackersin the dust , their shouts of excitement rising more loudly than the small explosions , and as he watched them he tried to think of somebody he could talk to , somebody to whom he could tell everything that had happened without leaving out the important things and without being asked a lot of questions , but as he went over the names of everybody he knew , checking them off one after another , he knew there was nobody , nobody he could trust . Already he had found that the kids he went to school with did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or about how much skill his job demandedat that critical moment when the trucks were changed , and he told himself that they were all growing different and getting dumb ; it was no fun running around with them any more . One after another he checked off their names in his mind , leaning against the shady side of the house and treasuringthe little moment of privacy there . He tried to imagine himself telling them , " Do you remember Walt Connor ? You know what he did ? " In his heart he knew they would not believe him , or they would think that Walt was smart and he was a damn fool for getting out of the car and not making Ellen come across too . . . . Then all at once he heard Mildred 's irritable voice , right at his elbow , " Mamma , make Johnny do something ! He moons around here ; he gives me the creeps ! " He turned on her , startled and offended . She was standing behind him on the porch , appealing to his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? " " Come look at him . " His mother stepped behind Mildred , peering over her shoulder , her round face a little troubled and impatient , as though she resented this interruption in her work . She gave him a swift scrutiny , concentrating the way she did when she thought one of the children was sick . He cried out indignantly , " What 's the matter with me ? " " What 's the matter , son ? "  | " Nothing ! She just snoops around . . . . What does she have to pick on me for ? Let her mind her own business ! " " Look at him , Mamma ! He looks so dopey ! Mamma , he did n't get in last night till three o'clock . I heard him and I looked to see what time it was . It was after three ! Look at his eyes . For a moment he was too outraged to answer . Then he said bitterly , " You sneak around . . . . You have to sneak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Now Mildred . " Mildred was alarmed at the bitterness she had aroused in him . Her voice softened . " No , Johnny . But you have to take care of yourself . Do n't he , Mamma ? And you look like the devil . Have you got a headache ? " She began to win him back , speaking softly and good-naturedly , until at last he was calmed . " I 've got a kind of a headache , " he admitted . " Why do n't you go for a walk ? " " I guess I will . " His mother went back inside , after saying , " Now , do n't tormenthim , Mildred . " Mildred stirred about on the porch , alwaysworking tensely , as if only a few moments were left before she had to catch a train or get the children to bed . As he thought about it he decided uneasily that he did have a headache and probably he did look sick , no wonder , while she worked back around to the questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , Johnny ? " " Just downtown . " " What girl ? " " What ? " " Which one was it ? " " What ? . . . Oh . " " Was she pretty ? " " Sort of . . . She works at the factory . " " What was her name ? "  |p248He  looked at her with a sudden suspicion . " What do you want to know for ? " " Come on , tell me . I wo n't tell anybody . " . Peggy. , " Peggy what ? " " I do n't know her last name . " He could sense her studying him and he felt a little secret pleasure at deceiving her . She continued to move briskly around the porch , but now he knew that she was not thinking of what she was doing , only trying to cover up her interest in where he had been and what he had been doing . She was separating the colored clothes from the white among the things that were to be washed , dividing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a dress that would fade among the sheets and pillow cases and recapturing it without changingthe rushed pace of her movements . " Did you like her ? " Did I like her , he thought . Why did n't she say do you like her ? " Oh . . . she 's all right , I guess . " She looked up at him . Their eyes met . He could see her trying to see into his mind , her eyes candidly inquisitive and searching . " Where 'd you go ? " " I just took her home . . . . I guess I 'll go for a walk , " he said . He did not turn his eyes away from her until she looked down . " I 've got a kind of a headache . I guess I 'll go downtown . " As he walked out to the street , past the open windows of the front room , he heard Gerald talking in his nervous salesmanvoice . " The French ca n't fly , " Gerald said . " Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out if I did anything , he thought wisely . Let her worry . Inside him the thought was warm and pleasing . Let her worry , he repeated . That 's one thing she 'll never find out .  |p249The  houses were all alike . The district where the people from the mills lived was larger than all the rest of town put together , acres of close packed wooden dwellings crowded between the hills and the waterfront . It was quiet now ; a few children were playing in the dusty streets and here and there a few firecrackers snapped , but most of the people had gone to town or out on the harbor where it was cool . He walked down the narrow sidewalk , sick of the smoky air and the heat and the racket at home , disturbed at Mildred 's questioning and wondering why she turned on him , until his mind began to go back once more to his dim plans for getting out of there , buying an old car , maybe , and heading for the mountains , findingsome old deserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the middle of the woods , or getting a bunch of money together and starting to college before he was too old to enjoy it  --  no , to hell with that , he thought , thinking of Walt coming up to him like a fraternity brother , saying All right , Shake on it , when he finally promised to try to get Ellen and Marie to go home with them . The bastard . The air was thick and dead . Sometimes the heavy flakes of ash floated down in the still air , wavering , settling like leaves . The sight of them made him think of the men out fighting the fire in this heat , and he whispered to himself , Poor devils , his brief pity an echo of thousands of comments he heard at home , the first natural response of people whose lives were so bound up with working that they could scarcely see a train without being conscious of the men who ran it , and whose first thought when they watched an exhibition of fireworks was of the rushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set them off . So a bit of ash or a sudden taste of burning fir called up to him a picture of the men burned sweatless in the woods , starting their back fires and driving themselves to clear a space too wide for the fire to leap . Someone called to him and he answered . The sound of the bands in town reached him faintly , and with a little rise of amusement he remembered thep250forlorn man who had stopped under the street lamp the night before , the huge horn coiled around him , the odd colors of his uniform . But then he began thinking about Ellen again , tormentinghimself with the picture of himself that he thought must be built up in her eyes ... . Too much ! There was too much to think about , too many mysteries , too many worries and surprises ! You could not tell what people were going to do . You could not depend on anybodybecause a man might come up and shake hands with you and the next minute desert you in a moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like something tossed to the wolves to worry and delay them for a while . I 'm going to get out of this town , he thought . I 'll be damned if I 'll live in a crazy place like this . He remembered with a rise of pain the warm excitement that had held him as he sat beside Ellen in the back seat of Walt 's car , remembering her serious little face and the neat fit of her overalls and her shirt unbuttoned way down her neck ; he remembered sitting beside her while they waited on the road , her troubled voice , soft and controlled even when she was mad ... . Beside him a voice said quietly , " Watch out you do n't knock her up . " Frankie Dwyer leaned over the fence in front of his house . When Johnny turned to him Frankie looked at him steadily , his expression unchanging , his eyes narrow and cryptic . His eyes were always narrowed because of the heat where he worked and his face was so burned that his eyebrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I can always see it ! I can always recognizethat old tail light . . . . Where 's your Old Man ? " He replied swiftly , hiding behind the words , " I do n't know . I think he 's still home . He was going down to Winters ' . " Frankie Dwyer came out into the street . " I want to see him . I just heard something . Carl 's going to fire your old man anyway . I was going down to your place when I seen you coming . . . . You do n't want to walk that way when you don'tp251look where you 're going . Somebody 's liable to trip you . Down where I was raised , down west Texas , a man could n't walk ten feet thataway ' thowt some son of a bitch tripping him . That 's a fact ! It 's the God-damnedest country for trippingyou ever saw .... " He asked in a low voice , " How 'd you know . . . . How 'd you hear ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife 's people  --  niece , I guess  --  she takes care of the Addisons ' kids and the Addisons live right next door to the Belchers . . . . I would n't pay no attention . Carl 's just talking . He 'd a fired your Old Man last year if he could have . " Johnny was not reassured , and he did not believe Dwyer intendedhim to be . He looked at the wooden sidewalk as the pulse began to pound behind his ears . He saw the torn planks that were marked with a thousand little dents , like worm holes , from the corked shoes of the loggers , his eyes searching for something substantial and motionless . The sidewalk sagged in places and some of the planks were broken ; at the edges the thistles and other weeds grew high as his knees over the level of the walk , their green hidden under the coating of powdered dust . He forced himself to look hard at the ground until his anxiety subsided . " I do n't take much stock in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's always a lot of it going around . " They turned in at Winters ' house and walked to the back yard where Winters was working on his car . It was a battered old Chevrolet , and Winters spent most of his spare time working on it . He had taken off the hood and the engine head and now he was getting ready to grind the valves , smearing the compound on and setting the grinder in place . He nodded briefly as they came in . Dwyer asked , " How 's Ann ? " " Better . She 's a good deal better . " They were silent for a few minutes . The formalities were over . Winters worked on the valve . His fingers darted withp252feverish adroitness , grasping the tools and holding them with no waste motions or loss of purpose . There was a faint shine of sweat on his dark Indian features . " I do n't know why I 'm doing this , " he said . " I guess it 's because I have n't got anything else to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimless marks in the ground beside his feet . " The hoist man died , " he announced abruptly . " I heard . " " Poor son of a bitch . " " He never came to . " " Good thing . " Dwyer looked hard at Johnny . He began to speak in an unvaried voice . " Made me think of something happened once when I was working up at Maloney 's Camp Number Twelve , way hell-and-gone up in the Olympics . That God-damned National City outfit , the worst highball camp I ever worked in  --  they kill a man up there every week . " " Bassett kills a man every week , " Winters said . " For that matter so does the Oberstaller Logging Corporation . So do them Chase camps . But this was different . These guys made a science of it . We logged with the equipment Oberstaller threw away . Once I seen the head rig come down and when the main block hit the cold deck them logs  --  big bastards ; it was fine timber  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whipped around like snakes . That same morning the engineer would n't go to work  --  said the whole rigging was coming down . But this was different . There was a kid working on the loading crew , just a kid , see , eighteen or nineteen years old  --  they could n't get old hands up into that slaughter-house . Well , they was highballing it so hard they had the whole train always waiting and the minute they pulled the last hook off the last log they pulled out  --  twelve miles to the main line and they raced their God-damn shay back and forth so fast they finally burnt it up . Anyway , before the kid got out of the way they pulled out and he slipped  --  it was raining , it was gettingp253dark  --  and he went right in under the wheels , got both his legs right here . " He drew his hand swiftly across his thighs . He paused and Johnny looked away , sickened at the picture his words called up , turning to look at Winters who continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying . " The train went on . No way to stop it . We had to wait till it got back . Nobody wanted to go down where the kid was . The guys all stood around out of the way . Finally I went down . Both legs were practically off . But the funny thing was that the weight of them logs sort of clamped the flesh together and he was n't losing much blood . And he was conscious . Some goofy bastard yelled to me . Is it bad ? What 'll we do ? ' I was down by the kid , I was n't sure if he could hear me , but I said , One leg is mashed , not so bad , only stop that God-damn shay ! ' It was getting dark ; it was raining like hell ; I did n't think he could tell . But he said here Dwyer 's voice grew heavy with contempt You 're a God-damned liar ! ' Jesus , I did n't know what to say . I stood there . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a green crew ; they could n't get old hands up there with a gun  --  and that kid yelled back at them : He 's a God-damned liar . They 're both of ' , right at the ass ' . " Johnny drew a deep breath . Dwyer ground his cigarette into the damp ground . At the house next door the woman stepped out on the porch and shook out a tablecloth , glancing at them briefly before she went inside . " Ah , " Johnny said . " Tough kid , " Winters said . " Yeah , " Dwyer replied . " He was tough . " But Johnny drew up inside , racked at the brutal picture and the hard words , trying to put them out of his mind and hoping something better happened . . . . " What happened ? " he managed to ask . " What ? " " What happened to him ? "  | " Nothing . He died . You think a man lives when he 's cut in two ? " In the oppressive silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly and sat down on the wooden walk that led to the shed in the rear . Presently he asked Dwyer , " What 'd you hear ? " " The same thing . He 's going to can you anyway . " " The Perkins girl ? " " Yeah . " Johnny looked up in surprise , recognizing the reference to the way they got their news and wondering that they took it for granted . Hagen asked , " What 'd she say ? " " Nothing . She just heard him beefing . He said you 'd spent your last night there . " Dwyer grinned slightly . " When I think about it , " he said , " it 's a wonder to me you fellows did n't get the can last night . " Hagen nodded and asked Winters about his wife . " Better , " Winters said . He put down the valve grinder . " I do n't know why I go on working on this old bastard , " he said . " Sometimes I think it ai n't worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hear him say anything about me ? " " She did n't say . " " I figure I might just as well be looking for a job . Ever since I popped him . " " He do n't know you popped him . " " Somebody 'll tell him . " Hagen disagreed cautiously . " You ca n't tell . A man do n't like to go around asking people who it was smacked him one . Besides , a lot of people are glad you popped him . More'n you 'd think . " Sorenson came into the yard . " I figured I 'd find you men here , " he said . " I just had an idea . I had to take my kids down to see the parade , and when I got home the thought just came to me  --  it 's two to one they 'll be over at Winters ' . I figuredp255they would n't be at your place , " he said to Hagen , " because of all your people being there . So that left only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody at Frank 's place . There 's going to be trouble tomorrow , " he announced . Johnny thought he heard a slight note of satisfaction , a rubbing-it-in tone , in Sorenson 's voice . " Carl 's been all over the district . He was down at Bullett 's place by ten o'clock and as soon as he left , Bullett went and got Prent Fisher and they waited till Carl got back . Then Carl drove up on the hill to the Old Man 's house and got Morley and him and Morley went out to the plant . " " How you know ? " " My wife seen him go into Bullett 's and Molly told Gil Ahab about going up to MacMahon 's . Old Mike seen them out in the factory . " " Son of a bitch gets around , " Dwyer said . " I never saw a fat man get around the way he does . " " He works hard at his job . You got to give him credit , " Sorenson said . " He never rests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting bears some place , but Belcher , he never lets up . You have to give a man like that credit . " They sat back and waited again , hovering uncertainly before saying the questions that were in their minds , waiting for someoneelse to start talking . Winters continued to work on his car . They watched him as intently as if he were carrying on some unique experiment or as if he were performing a major operation and they were a group of students studying his methods . " The way I look at it , " Sorenson announced abruptly , " There 's a good chance he 'll fire all of us . " " I was just thinking .... " " What do you figure on doing ? " Winters put down his tools . " Figure it out , " he said . " Why do we have to take it ? How many we got ? How many we sure of ? Sooner or later he 's going after you guys because            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
