txt An agreement that is expected to permit the tearing down of the entire Sixth Avenue elevated line within a few months has been reached between the city and the controlling financial interests of the elevated lines after nearly twenty years of intermittent negotiations , it was announced at Mayor La Guardia 's office in City Hall yesterday . The plan calls for the acquisition by the city of the Sixth Avenue line for $12,500,000 . From this sum will be deducted $7,190,724 in back taxes and $1,434,800 in interest owed to the city by the Manhattan Railway Corporation , owner of the line . The price to be paid in cash is $3,874,475 . The value of the real estate affected is now estimated by city experts to be $509,000,000 . These same experts have informed the Mayor that the value may be expected to increase by $275,000,000 within ten years after the noisy and dirty elevated structure is torn down . Plan Filed With Court The plan by which the city may acquire the flni V &A; i ; olitainecl in apetition filed before Federal Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's main elevated lines , and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company , which operates them , are both in receivership , their affairs now being adjudicated in Federal court . The petition was filed by a protective committee of Manhattan bondholders which requested the court to approve the proposed agreement . At 1 P. M. yesterday Judge Patterson received in his chambers a group of the interested attorneys and informed them that he would hold hearings on the proposal Friday , May 6 , at 4 P. M. , in Federal court . The attorneys were Boykin C. Wright , representing the Manhattan consolidated mortgage bonds ; Van S. Merle-Smith , chairman of the committee of these bonds ; Joseph L. Weiner , counsel for the Board of Transportation of New York City , and William G. Mulligan Jr. , Assistant Corporation Counsel in charge of the transit division . Boards Must Approve A stipulation providing for the transfer of the elevated properties will be entered into after these hearings . It must be approved by the Transit Commission and the Board of Estimate . Transit experts representing all factions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason why the plan should not go through . After outlining the financial necessity of reaching terms withthe city , the petition states : " Your petiponerr , through their chairman , have been carrying on . negotiations with the Mayor of the City of New York and officials designated by him , and as a result thereof the Mayor and your petitioners have agreed to recommend to the Board of Estimate and to the Interborough parties , respec- .. tively , the acquisition by the city of the Sixth Avenue elevated lines for the sum of $12,500,000 upon the terms and conditions set forth in a proposed stipulation attached hereto . " The court is asked in the petition to approve of the transfer of the Sixth Avenue line to the city and to authorize Thomas E. Murray Jr. , I. R. T. receiver , and William Roberts , the Manhattan receiver ; the Central Hanover Bank and Trust Company , as trustees of the consolidated mortgage ; the Chase National Bank as trustee of the second mortgage and deed of trust of the Manhattan , and the Guaranty Trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refunding mortgage of the I. R. T. to enter into the stipulation . Protection Is Provided The six sections of the stipulation offer protection both to the city and to the pr iVate financial interests involved . In 1925 the Transit Commission declined to approve a somewhat similar plan offered by Samuel Seabury and Adolf A. Berle Jr . for the acquisition of the ' lines . The commission expressed the fear that the acquisition of the elevated ' lines piecemeal by the city might prejudice the city 's rights in an action brought by the I. R. T. to get rid of its contract to operate the Manhattan lines . The stipulation made public yesterday contains a clause stating that it " shall not diminish or in anywise affect ? ? ? any obligations or duties owed to the City of New York or the riding public by any of the parties hereto arising by reason of the terms of the elevated extension certificates or any related document to which the City of New York is a party ' ? " . " At the time the petition was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by long distance telephone at Wichita Falls , Texas He said : " I am glad to hear that the petition is being filed . I have been working on this job for some time . The agreement on it was reached just a short time before I left my office . I am sure that we will get some real ? speedy action on this matter . " Asks to Reorganize Shortly before the petition was filed the Manhattan Railway Company filed a ' voluntary petition for authority to reorganize under Section 77-B of . the Bankruptcy Act . The company listed its assets at $130,617,778 and liabilities at $53,822,342 . This move was considered to have little bearing on the situation , since the company is already in an equity receivership . It was pointed out , however , that under a 77-B procedure , as opposed to equity proceedings , the company might hope for greater protection against two threats which now confront it . One of these threats was the city 's ac ' tion to recover taxes , a situation resolved by the purchase petition move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortgage trustee , the Central Hanover- , Bank , which is about tell 0114 vigorously pressed , according to bank 's attorneys . The 77-B petition was filed Charles Franklin , attorney for than L. Amster , president of Manhattan Railway Company . ther Mr. Franklin , Mr. Amster indeed , the Manhattan Rail Company itself was a party to petition , which was filed by a neys for the interests having fi cial control . In some circles it said that the Manhattan Rail Company might oppose the peti and the plan contained in the ulation . If such opposition is fered the court will decide whe or not it is warranted . Properties Are Listed The 77-B petition notes that Manhattan company includes so-called Second , Third , Sixth Ninth Avenue lines as well as City Hall extension , with a to nal for the Third Avenue lin City Hall as well as stations , stations , power houses and rail equipment . The principal indebtedness of Manhattan Railway Company listed in the petition includes ' 676,4 ) 00 under outstanding fir per cent bond issues , and $4,5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For taxes there is a total of $7,188,524 with in amounting to more than $1,400 There are outstanding 500,000 sh of capital stock , with a par v of $100 a share . An inkling of an unusual si tion in transit matters was gained by transit advisors in Federal court yesterday morning after Judge Patterson had summoned before him all attorneys interested in the action by the I. R. T. to disaffirm the 999-year lease under which it operates the Manhattan properties . ? Asks Attorneys ' Views Judge Patterson told the attorneys he wished to be more fully informed of their views on the joint traffic agreement entered into between the I. R. T. and the city . Specifically , the judge wished to hear their opinions on the question of whether the I. R. T. will be obliged to operate the Bronx and Queens extensions after 1962 , when the I. R. T. 's subway contract with the city will expire . Charles Evans Hughes Jr. , . representing the Manhattan equity reerShip , and Mr. Mulligan of the oration Counsel 's office coned in the opinion before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate the lines under terms of the trackage agreet .
