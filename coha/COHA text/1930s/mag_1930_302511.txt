Great was the suspense in a Manhattan concert hall last week . After each burst of applause an expectant silence fell in the audience . Many thought , particularly after the sweeping finale of the Liszt Preludes , that Conductor Willem Mengelberg would speak . He had been presented with a floral wreath . They knew that it was his last performance of the season with the Philharmonic-Symphony. * Their programs told them so . Many suspected , moreover , that it was his final farewell to the Philharmonic and to Manhattan . The rumor had spread that he had criticized the condition in which Conductor Arturo Toscanini had left the orchestra , that Toscanini had heard and resented it ; that he ( Mengelberg ) resented not having been invited to conduct the Philharmonic in any of its European concerts this spring ( TIME , July 15 ) . Mengelberg performances this season have suffered sadly in comparison with Toscanini 's . Critics have flayed them unhesitatingly . Mengelberg , who for 35 years has been undisputed musical lord of Amsterdam , is unlikely to be willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he will go to San Francisco next year to succeed Conductor Alfred Hertz . Other possible Hertz successors : Bruno Walter and Leo Blech , both Germans . <P> <P> *The Italian Bernardino Molinari will conduct the Philharmonic for the next five weeks . In February Toscanini will return to conduct the season 's last eight weeks ; on April 23 he will take the orchestra to Europe .
