txt On the greatest activity in more than two weeks , the Dow-Jones industrial and railroad averages Thursday advanced out of the " line " in which they had been fluctuating since their April 29 lows . Turnover was more than double that of any of the preceding three clays of the week , and the close found the industrials at 151.49 and the rails at 44.99 . In the preceding two weeks , the industrials had not sold below 145.67 nor above 149.73. and the rails had not sold below 43,28 nor above 44.58 . Under the Dow theory such a period of narrow fluctuations is regarded as reflecting either accumulation or distribution , and the direction taken by the averages in quitting the line gives the answer as to whether the buying or the selling is stronger . It is a little early to conclude that the intermediate downtrend from the 161.99 peak in the industrials and the 51.27 peak in the rails Is definitely ended . Not only was the decline to the April 29 lows of 143.65 anci.42.30 somewhat less , in the industrials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upturn as they had had in the preceding 13 months , but the subsequent recovery from the April 29 lows was even at last night 's close no more than the usual technical rebound . Ten years ago , after a top not unlike that seen this Spring , the industrials declined from 162.31 to 144.44 , then rallied to 153.13 , only to relapse once more to 135.20 before resuming the great bull market in earnest . A possibly significant difference this time is that volume seems to be showing a tendency to Increase on the rally , whereas in 1926 it dwindled steadily on the rise and increased again on the decline . Another noteworthy difference is that the rally this time has been comparatively slow , having taken already nearly twice as much time as the 1926 rebound . In uptrends " corrections " are commonly comparatively short and sharp , followed by gradual resumption of the rise , whereas , sharp recoveries followed by dullness and gradually increasing selling pressure are frequently observed in prolonged downtrends . The minor trend , in any event . is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the persistence of the nearly four-year old primary uptrend . The way the market takes the selling it is bound to encounter as those who failed to get out before the last break seize their new opportunities to do so should reveal whether the intermediate trend , too , favors the bulls .
