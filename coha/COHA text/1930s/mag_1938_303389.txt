WHAT ARE WE TO Do ? - John Strachey - Random House ( $3 ) . <P> To the accusation that Marxist theoreticians are as dour as they are unintelligible , the favorite Red comeback is the case of John Strachey . Cousin of the late Lytton Strachey , heir to an English baronetcy , former M.P . who in 1931 quit the Mac-Donald coalition government to join the Reds , John Strachey is a softly athletic six-footer who lectures in tails . Smoothtongued , witty , he has made himself a favorite with middle-class lecture audiences , while his Coming Struggle for Power ( 1933 ) , the first and only " Party line " bestseller , made him a reputation as the nearest thing to a popularizer of the nearly unpopularizable Karl Marx . <P> What Are We to Do ? , a study of the " rise and fall " of the British labor movement , is an urbane , inquisitional chronicle of missed opportunities , compromises , retreats , timidities , defeats . These all are traced to one original sin : The adoption by British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " socialism taught by the Fabians under Sydney Webb and George Bernard Shaw , instead of the " scientific socialism " of Karl Marx . The Fabians were not consciously malicious or cowardly , says Strachey , they were merely ignorant , got their socialist wires crossed because they did not know what a capitalist State was all about . They said the State was " a great league of consumers , " hence worked with the Government when they thought its politicians " good , " sulked when they considered them " bad . " Marxists said the State was a purely class instrument- " good " politicians were only capitalist politicians wearing democratic rouge . The State , says Strachey , is like a revolver-bad in the hands of a robber , good in the hands of those repelling the robber . <P> It is this thought which must , says Strachey , animate " The New Model " Labor Party of England and the U. S. At present , he confesses , The New Model is mostly in rough pencil sketch . But he is immensely confident in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U. S. , all that is now needed is to create a Labor Party , enroll a couple of hundred thousand more Communists to start the Labor Party off on the Left foot .
