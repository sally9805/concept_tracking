Experience shows that Russia 's new Five-Year Plan factories can be made to produce , if given sufficient time for tuning up . But last week famed Molotov , largest motor car &; tractor factory in Europe , had got into a state of " shocking unfulfillment of the plan . " <P> Opened Jan. 1 and named after the Premier of the Soviet Union , mammoth Molotov was given until April 1 to tune up . When the tuning progressed slowly Dictator Josef Stalin sent black-eyed Grigoriy Ordzhonikidze , Minister of Heavy Industry , rushing out to Molotov with what amounted to powers of life &; death ( TIME , April 11 ) . By April 15 , Moscow ordered , Molotov must be tuned up and producing . <P> A whole month after this deadline Molotov was not producing either complete cars or trucks last week . By heroic efforts 301 motors had been produced , instead of the scheduled 1,075 , and only 143 front axles instead of 750 . Rear axles , with their gears , are harder to make . Molotov has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear axles . " On this job , representing maximum effort by Dictator Stalin and the best Soviet technicians , worked also several score U. S. and German mechanics . <P> Moscow papers spoke of Molotov last week by its other name , Autostroy , sparing the Premier 's name from odium . Explaining the drastic drop behind schedule Pravda ( " Truth " ) listed three major causes : 1 ) failure of Soviet metallurgical plants to supply steel on schedule ; 2 ) bad food for the workers ; 3 ) uncomfortable living conditions . <P> Since Stalin &; staff have put so much heart and effort directly into Molotov , last week 's official breakdown might be called the first major blow to the prestige of the Five-Year Plan . Much larger than Molotov is Cheliabinsk , the newly-opened " world 's largest tractor plant . " When it was announced last week that Cheliabinsk " has produced nothing except experimental machines , " knowing Russians merely shrugged . At Cheliabinsk such a breakdown was to be expected , at Molotov it was not . <P> Officially the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) said of Cheliabinsk : <P> " Faulty construction of various departments has resulted in extremely unsatisfactory conditions . . . enormous losses from waste and breakage in construction ... the conveyor branch is not working due to the fact that several departments have been only partly completed . " <P> At Stalingrad , the star new Soviet tractor plant , 150 tractors are now produced daily . Almost two years passed in tuning up Stalingrad .
