Folks in Red River County , Texas , where John Nance Garner was born , have never forgiven Uvalde , where he now lives , for getting the jump on them in starting a Garner-for-President boom in 1931 . Last week they repaid Uvalde in full . Six miles southwest of Detroit , Texas , around the cabin where John Garner 's mother was born in 1851 , they assembled to " direct the attention of our fellow citizens to his outstanding qualifications for President of the United States . " <P> Bigwig Texas Democrats who are nursing the Garner embryo would rather have waited awhile . But when Red River County invited them to its party , they could do nothing but accept . <P> Out in front for Garner is snow-topped , dandyish Roy Miller of Corpus Christi , a well-paid lobbyist for Texas Gulf Sulphur Co . Roy Miller was of course the principal speaker at Red River 's send-off last week . Perched on the rear stoop of the weather-blackened Garner shanty , he addressed the gathering of country folk from Possum Trot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Garner-for-President : that he is too old ( 70 now ; 72 by inauguration day in 1941 ) ; that he is reactionary by New Deal standards , that he is knifing Franklin Roosevelt or Franklin Roosevelt 's man for 1940 . Said Keynoter Miller : <P> " Today he is at the peak of his mental and physical vitality . . . . The only thing old about John Garner is his philosophy . He still believes in the old-fashioned virtues of economy , thrift and self-reliance . . . . We do , however , plant our feet firmly upon Democratic and American tradition in respect to terms of service . " <P> This at least summarized John Nance Garner 's chief strength as a 1940 candidate , his potentialities as a Third Term blocker . <P> Meantime , remote and mum , the Vice President hunted deer and superintended the digging of two new wells on his 23,000-acre ranch in Webb Countv.
