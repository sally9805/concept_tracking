This was the third non-stop flight from continental United States to the canal , but the others started from Miami . Captain Ammel already has announced that he will attempt a nonstop flight to Chicago after he has rested here for three or four days . When it was first sighted from France Field today , the Blue Flash , with its broad , bright yellow wings and deep blue body , wsa cruising easily over Limon Bay and looked like a huge flamingo .

Miami was blazing with lights when he pushed Into the dark seaward toward Cuba . Cuba slept while the Blue Flash soared over the island from Matanzas to the Isle of Pines , where , Captain Ammel said , he was glad to see the sun again .

Finally I lifted the seat until my head stuck above the windshield and after an hour in a 145-mile gale my head cleared and I began to try to see where I was . " My eyes seemed to go back on me , but I finally got down to where I could see the tops of palm trees outlined on the coast . " " 1 Fighting a head wind most of the distance , Captain Ammel descended from an altitude of 4,000 feet to skim just over the tops of the palm trees .

The American airmen made his flight to Panama with but few sightings . He circled over Candler Field , Atlanta , Ga. , last night , but his markings could not be seen , The Associated Press reported . The Tropical Radio Station reported that the steamship Tivives had sighted him off the northeast coast of Honduras at 9:35 o'clock yesterday morning . From that time until his arrival at France Field no direct word was heard of him . Captain Ammel made his first solo flight after less than four hours ' instruction . On his next solo he began looping his plane , but army discipline intervened and for two weeks he was kept busy peeling onions and potatoes . p , " I must have been a little wild then , " he admitted , " because they later made me instructor of aerial acrobatics .

He won from the War Department permission to take off in a flying boat from Colon , Panama , to New York . In Bluefields , Nicaragua , a town 400 miles from the starting point , the water jacket cracked and he made a forced landing . A new engine was installed and he was about to resume the flight when a curt order was received from headquarters which closed for a time any hope of flying across the country . He had more than 8,000 flying hours to his credit when he gained his discharge from service and in 1919 went to Peru to develop that government 's air corps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juan Leguia , son of the former President of Peru . Tried Business Here . Late in 1920 Captain Ammel returned to New York and went into the import and export , business . He built up a sizabie fortune , only to lose it In 1923 . Then he went to Allentown , Pa. , to assume the management of a branch of the Mortgage Finance Company . He left this post in 1924 and went to Chicago , where he became a broker in building materials . During these years he maintained his interest in flying , had two weeks of practice yearly as a captain in the reserve corps and went - aloft whenever he had an opportunity . Eventually he bought a plane of his own . It was at this time that his ideas of transoceanic flights assumed definite shape . Twice he started preparations , once in 1925 and again in 1928 , but each time the venture failed . Then he began thinking of the type plane which now is known as the " Explorer .
