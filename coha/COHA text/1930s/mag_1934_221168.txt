Last week Pullman Inc. reported a third quarter profit of $2,100,000-best figure for any quarter in four years . Pullman lost money last year and the year before but as late as 1930 it rolled up earnings of $16,000,000 . Well-buttressed with cash ( $36,000,000 at the end of September ) , with no bonds , no preferred stock , it paid a $3 dividend through the blackest years of Depression . <P> Pullman is a holding company controlling two distinct organizations . One is The Pullman Co. , which has a practical monopoly on railroad comfort. * The other is Pullman Car &; Manufacturing Corp. , which is one of the biggest U. S. makers of railroad rolling stock . Lately Pullman 's equipment business has fattened on railroad orders financed with PWA loans . It built Union Pacific 's two streamlined , high-speed trains , has orders booked for two more . From Pullman , Illinois Central also wants an experimental five-car train . <P> Air-conditioning , as the latest wrinkle in U. S. transportation comfort , has helped keep Pullman 's great shops open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and another 1,000 will be finished by the end of 1935 . The company has developed its own air-conditioning machinery but a few railroads prefer to install other types . The 141 Pullmans used in Baltimore &; Ohio 's crack trains are all fitted with York machinery . Atchison , Topeka &; Santa Fe has 30 Pullmans equipped by Carrier Corp . However , Pullman has outfitted about one-half of the 1,400 air-conditioned diners , club and lounge cars owned by the railroads . Such special work accounted for no small part of the profits announced last week . <P> Pullman owns 8,500 cars with names ranging from Abbakon to Zurich . Of these only 4,900 are now in use . The company has not built a Pullman car since 1930 . <P> In the eyes of the Interstate Commerce Commission if not of the traveling public , The Pullman Co. is a common carrier . In the first nine months of 1934 it reported to I. C. C. gross passenger revenues of $33,000,000 which was $4,500,000 better than in the same period of 1933 . Average passengers per Pullman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Most cars will seat or sleep 28 persons . ) Last year 9,000,000 people bought berths , 4,000,000 bought seats , a total of 13,000,000 Pullman passengers ; in 1929 there were 33,000,000 . <P> Yet Pullman fares have not been cut 1 to meet present price levels . Western and Southern roads have voluntarily dropped the notorious 50% surcharge on Pullman space which many a passenger wrongly held against the Pullman Co. instead of the railroads . Eastern roads with heavier passenger traffic have neither dropped the surcharge nor reduced the basic fare . <P> If Pullman has not cut its own prices it has at least made a lively bid for business with three types of bargains : <P> 1 ) Every Pullman conductor now tries to sell a section for the price of a lower berth plus one-half the price of the unused upper . <P> 2 ) Special round-trip excursions to " historic " points like Niagara Falls are sold at only a fraction more than the one-way Pullman charge . With 3,400 cars in that service last year Pullman reported the amazing average of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges for round-trips are liberally offered to vacation spots and resorts .
