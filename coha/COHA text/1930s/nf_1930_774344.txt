txt  | The original bill of complaint was brought by the Interstate Coin merce Commission , created by virtue of an act of Congress , entitled " An act to regulate commerce , " approved February 4 , 1887 , c. 101 , 24 Stat. 379 , as amended by an act approved February 10 , 1891 , c. 128 , 26 Stat. 743 , against the Texas and Pacific Railway Company , a corporation chartered and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the United States , having its principal office at New York City . The object of the bill was to compel the defendant company to obey an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission , made on January 29 , 1891 , whereby the said defendant was ordered to " forthwith cease and desist from carrying any article of imported traffic shipped from any foreign port through any port of entry of the United States , or any port of entry in a foreign country adjacent to the United States , up ( in through bills of lading destined to any place within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inland tariff covering other freight from such port of entry to such place of destination , or any other than the same rates established in such inland tariff for the carriage of other like kind of freight , in the elements of bulk , weight , value and expense of carriage " ; and which order the said defendant was alleged to have wholly disregarded and set at naught . It appears by the bill that on March 23 , 1889 , the Commission , of its own motion and without a hearing of the parties to be affected , had made a certain order wherein , among other things , it was provided as follows : " Imported traffic transported to any place in the United States from a port of entry or place of reception , whether in this country or in an adjacent foreign country , is required to be taken on the inland tariff governing other freights.

The companies first warned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company , the Pittsburgh , Ft .

The several defendant companies filed answers . The answer of the Texas and Pacific Railway Company , admitting that both before and since March 23 , 1889 , it had carried imported traffic at lower rates than it contemporaneously charged for like traffic originating in the United States , justified by claiming that through shipments from a foreign country to the interior of the United States differ in circumstances and conclitions from shipments originating at the American seaboard bound for the same interior points , and that defendant company has a legal right to accept for its share of the through rate a lower sum than it receives for domestic shipment to the same destination from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | The result of the hearing before the Interstate Commerce Commis lion was , so far as the present case is concerned , that the Commissions held that the Texas and Pacific Railway Company was not " justified in accepting , as its share of a through rate on imported traffic , a loss charge or sum than it charged and received for inland traffic between the port of reception and the point of delivery , and the said order of January 29 , 1891 , commanding that said company desist from distinguishing in its charges between foreign and inland traffic , was made . 4 Interstate Corn . Coln . Rep. 447 . As the Texas and Pacific Railway Company declined to observe said order , the Commission filed its present bill against said company in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York . The railway company filed a plea in abatement , denying that its principal office was in the Southern District of New York , and deny ing that it had violated or disobeyed the order of the Commission within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court . Certain affidavits were filed , upon a stipulation , as to the facts , and , after hearing , the plea was overruled , and also a motion to dismiss the proceedings for want of jurisdiction was denied ? and to these rulings exceptions were taken and allowed . The defendant company answered , alleging that the Interstate Commerce Commission was not a corporation , person or body politic capable of bringing or maintaining this suit ? that the petition or hill failed to allege or show any facts constituting a violation by the defendant of the order of January 29 , 1891 , and did not show or allege any specific act or acts by the defendant in violation of the act of Congress ? that the Southern Pacific Company , as participant with the defendant in the making and division of the through rates , was a necessary party , and that the bill should be dismissed for want of such necessary party . The answer , admitting that the company had charged and received , since January 29 , 1891 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , England , via New Orleans and the Texas and Pacific Railway and the Southern Pacific Company to San Francisco , California , different from the rates charged and received for the transportation of inland commodities from New Orleans by the same route to San Francisco , asserted that it had a legal right so to do and that such action was not in violation of the act of Congress regulating commerce , or of any valid order of the Interstate Commerce  | Commission . The answer set up a number of facts which it alleged sustained its defense . The cause was heard upon the petition , answer and sundry exhibits , and resulted in a decree declaring that the order of January 29 , 1891 , was lawful , and that the same had been disobeyed by the defendant , and enjoining the defendant from further continuing such disobedience of said order . An appeal , with errors assigned , was taken from this decree to the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit , by which , on June 3 , 1893 , the decree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ App. 1 ) . An appeal was then taken , on errors assigned , from said decree to this court ... . MR . JUSTICE SHIRAS , after stating the case , delivered the opinion of the court ... . We come now to the main question of the case , and that is whether the Commission erred , when making the order of January 29 , 1891 , in not taking into consideration the ocean competition as constituting a dissimilar condition , and in holding that no circumstances and conditions which exist beyond the seaboard in the United States could be legitimately regarded by them for the purpose of justifying a difference in rates between import and domestic traffic . The answer of the Texas and Pacific Railway Company to the petit ion of the New York Board of Trade and Transportation before the Interstate Commerce Commission , and the answer of said company to the petition of the Commission filed in the Circuit Court , allege that rates for the transportation of commodities from Liverpool and London , England , to San Francisco , California , are in effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire distance ; by steamships and sailing vessels in connection with railroads across the Isthmus of Panama ; by steamships and sailing vessels from Europe to New Orleans , connecting these under through arrangements with the Southern Pacific Company to San Francisco : That unless the defendant company charges substantially the rates specified in its answer , it would be prevented , by reason of the competition aforesaid , from engaging in the carrying and transportation of property and . import traffic from Liverpool and London to San Francisco , and would lose the revenue derived by it therefrom , which is considerable , and important and valuable to said company : That the rates charged by it are not to the prejudice or disadvantage of New Orleans , and work no injury to that community , because , if said company is prevented from participating in said traffic , such traffic would move via  | the other routes and lines aforesaid without benefit to New Orleans , but , on the contrary , to its disadvantage : That the foreign or imp i t traffic is upon orders by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicinity buying direct of first hands in London , Liverpool , and other European markets ; and if the order of the Commission should be carried into effect it would not result in discontinuance of that practice or in inducing them to buy in New Orleans in any event : That the result of the order would be to injuriously affect the defendant company in the carriage of articles of foreign imports to Mein phis , St. Louis , Kansas City and other Missouri River points : And that by such order the defendant company would be prevented front competing for freight to important points in the state of Texas with the railroad system of that state , having Galveston as a receiving port , and which railroad system is not subject to the control of th Interstate Commerce Commission . These allegations of the answ were not traversed or denied by the Commission , but are confirm by the findings of the Commission attached as an exhibit to the pelf tion in the case ; and by said findings it further appears that the pr portion the Texas and Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preponderance of its empty cars go nor during eight months of the year , and if something can be obtained load , it is that much found , and anything is regarded as remunerativ that can be obtained to put in its cars to pay mileage ? that the corn petition which controls the making of rates to the Pacific coast steamship by way of the Isthmus and in cheap heavy goods aroun Cape Horn ? that the competition to interior points , such as Mi souri River points and Denver , is from the trunk lines direct from t he Atlantic seaboard ? that the ships engaged in carrying to San Francisco around Cape Horn are almost wholly British bottoms ? that the through bill of lading furnishes a collateral for the transaction of business , takes from the shipper and consignee both the care as to intermediate charges , elevators , wharves and cost of handling , and puts it on the carrier ; it reduces the intermediate charges , very much facilitates the transaction of business , and helps to swell its volume - and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obstacles between the producer and consumer , and it has done much in that direction . These and other uncontroverted facts that appear in this record would seem to constitute " circumstances and conditions " worthy of consideration , when carriers are charged with being guilty of unjust  | incrimination or of giving unreasonable and undue preference or vantage to any person or locality . But we understand the view of the Commission to have been that t was not competent for the Commission to consider such facts ? at it was shut up by the terms of the act of Congress , to consider ly such " circumstances and conditions " as pertained to the articles I traffic after they had reached and been delivered at a port of the nited States or Canada . It is proper that we should give the views of the Commission in its wn words : The statute has provided for the regulation of interstate traffic by interstate carriers , partly by rail and partly by water , or all rail , shipped from one point in the United States to another destination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipment in the United States to a port of entry within the United States or an adjacent foreign country , or from a port of entry either within the United States or in an adjacent foreign country , on import traffic rought to such port of entry from a foreign port of shipment and destined to a place within the United States . In providing for this regulation the tatute has also provided for the methods of such regulation by publication of tariffs of rates and charges at points where the freight is received and at which it is delivered , and also for taking into consideration the circumstances rid conditions surrounding the transportation of the property . The statute has undertaken no such regulation from foreign ports of shipment to ports of entry either within the United States or to ports of entry in an adjacent foreign country , and as between these ports has provided for no publication of tariffs of rates and charges , but has left it to the unrestrained competition of ocean carriers and all the circumstances and conditions surrounding it . These circumstances and conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conditions surrounding the carriage of domestic Interstate traffic between the states of the American Union by rail carriers ; but as the regulation provided for by the act to regulate commerce does not undertake to regulate or govern them , they can not be held to constitute reasons in themselves why imported freight brought to a port of entry of the United States or a port of entry of an adjacent foreign country destined to a place within the United States should be carried at a lower rate than domestic traffic from such ports of entry respectively to the places of destination in the United States over the same line and in the same direction . To hold otherwise would be for the Commission to create exceptions to the operation of the Statute not found in the statute ; and no other power but Congress can create such exception in the exercise of legislative authority . In the one case the freight is transported from a point of origin in the United States to a destination within the United States , or port of transshipment , if it be intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reasonable and just , not unjustly preferential to one kind of traffic over another , and  | relatively fair and just as between localities ; and the circumstances and coil . ditions surrounding and involved in the transportation of the freight are in u very high degree material . In the other case the freight originates in a foreign country , its carriage is commenced from a foreign port , it is carried upon rites that are not open and published , but are secret , and in making these rates it is wholly immaterial to the parties making them whether they are reasonable and ' just or not , so they take the freight and beat a rival , and it is equally immaterial to them whether they unjustly discriminate against surrounding or rival localities in such foreign country or not . Imported foreign merchandice has all the benefit and advantage of rates thus made in the foreign ports ; it also has all the benefit and advantage of the low rates made in the ocean carriage arising from the peculiar circumstances and conditions under which that is done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , or it port of entry of a foreign country adjacent to the United States , in either event upon a through bill of lading destined to a place in the United States , then its carriage from such port of entry to its place of destination in the United States under the operation of the act to regulate commerce must be under the inland tariff from such port of entry to such place of destination , covering other like kind of traffic in the elements of bulk , weight , value and of carriage ; and no unjust preference must be given to it in carriage or facilities of carriage over other freight . In such case all the circumstances and conditions that have surrounded its rates and carriage from the foreign port to the port of entry have had their full weight and operation , and in its carriage from the port of entry to the place of its destination in the United States , the mere fact that it is foreign merchandise thus brought from a foreign port is not a circumstance or condition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which entitles it to lower rates or any other preference in facilities and carriage over home merchandise , or other traffic of a like kind carried by the inland carrier from the port of entry to the place of destination in the United States for the same distance and over the same line . . . . The act to regulate commerce will be examined in vain to find any intima. tion that there shall be any difference made in the tolls , rates or charges for , or any difference in the treatment of home and foreign merchandise in respect to the same or similar service rendered in the transportation , when this trans. portation is done under the operation of this statute . Certainly it would require a proviso or exception plainly ingrafted upon the face of the act to regulate commerce , before any tribunal charged with its administration would lx authorized to decide or hold that foreign merchandise was entitled to any preference in tolls , rates or charges made for , or any difference in its treatment for , the same or similar service as against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the operation of this statute , when handled and transported by interstate carriers , engaged in carriage in t he United States , stand exactly upon the same basis of equality as to tolls , rates , charges and treatment for similar services rendered . The business complained of in this proceeding is done in the shipment of foreign merchandise from foreign ports through ports of entry of the United  | States , or through ports of entry in a foreign country adjacent to the United States , to points of destination in the United States , upon through bills of lading . 4 Interstate Corn . Corn . Rep. 512-516 . It is obvious , therefore , that the Commission , in formulating the order of January 29 , 1891 , acted upon that view of the meaning of the statute which is expressed in the foregoing passages . We have , therefore , to deal only with a question of law , and that is , what is the true construction , in respect to the matters involved in the present controversy , of the act to regulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commission was right , then the order was lawful ; otherwise it was not ... . After an investigation made by the Commission on a complaint against the Texas and Pacific Railway Company and other companies by the boards of trade above mentioned , the result reached was the order of the Commission made on January 29 , 1891 , a disregard of which was complained of by the Commission in its bill or petition filed in the Circuit Court of the United States . The Texas and Pacific Railway Company , a corporation created by laws of the United States , and also possessed of certain grants from the state of Texas , owns a railroad extending from the city of New Orleans , through the state of Texas , to El Paso , where it connects with the railroad of the Southern Pacific Company , the two roads forming a through route to San Francisco . The Texas and Pacific Railway Company has likewise connections with the other railroads and steamers , forming through freight lines to Memphis , St. Louis and other points on the Missouri River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a scheme or mode of obtaining foreign traffic , it had agencies by which , and by the use of through bills of lading , it secured shipments of merchandise from Liverpool and London , and other European ports , to San Francisco and to the other inland points named . It alleged that , in order to get this traffic , it was necessary to give through rates from the places of shipment to the places of final destination , and that , in fixing said rates , it was controlled by an ocean competition by sailing and steam vessels by way of the Isthmus and around the Horn , and also , to some extent , by a competition through the Canada route to the Pacific coast . These rates , so fixed and controlled , left to the defendant company and to the Southern Pacific Company , as their share of the charges made and collected , less than the local charges of said companies in transporting similar merchandise from New Orleans to San Francisco , and so , too ,  | as to foreign merchandise carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless it used said means to get such traffic the merchandise to the Pacific coast would , none of it , reach New Orleans , but would go by the other means of transportation ; that neither the community of New Orleans nor any merchant or shipper thereof was injured or made complaint ? that the traffic thus secured was remunerative to the railway company and was obviously beneficial to the consumers at the places of destination , who were thus enabled to get their goods at lower rates than would prevail if this custom of through rates was destroyed . As we have already stated , the Commission did not charge or find that the local rates charged by the defendant company were unreasonable , nor did they find that any complaint was made by the city of New Orleans , or by any person or organization there doing business . Much less did they find that any complaint was made by the localities to which this traffic was carried , or that any cause for such complaint existed . The Commission justified its action wholly upon the construction put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbidding the Commission to consider the " circumstances and conditions " attendant upon the foreign traffic as such " circumstances and conditions " as they are directed in the act to consider . The Commission thought it was constrained by the act to regard foreign and domestic traffic as like kinds of traffic under substantially similar circumstances and conditions , and that the action of the defendant company in procuring through traffic that would , except for the through rates , not reach the port of New Orleans , and in taking its pro-rata share of such rates , was an act of " unjust discrimination , " within the meaning of the act . In so construing the act we think the Commission erred . As we have already said , it could not be supposed that Congress , in regulating commerce , would intend to forbid or destroy an existing branch of commerce , of value to the common carriers and to the consumers within the United States . Clearly , express language must be used in the act to justify such a supposition . So far from finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct the Commission , when asked to find a common carrier guilty of a disregard of the act , to take into consideration all the facts of the given case ? among which are to be considered the welfare and advantage of the common carrier , and of the great body of the citizens of the United States who constitute the consumers and recipients of the mer- chandise carried ; and that the attention of the Commission is not to be confined to the advantage of shippers and merchants who deal at or near the ports of the United States , in articles of domestic production . Undoubtedly the latter are likewise entitled to be considered ; but we can not concede that the Commission is shut up by the terms of this act to solely regard the complaints of one class of the community . We think that Congress has here pointed out that , in considering questions of this sort , the Commission is not only to consider the wishes and interests of the shippers and merchants of large cities , but to consider also the desire and advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the interest of the public that the carriers should secure that traffic , rather than abandon it , or not attempt to secure it . It is self-evident that many cases may and do arise where , although the object of the carriers is to secure the traffic for their own purposes and upon their own lines , yet , nevertheless , the very fact that they seek , by the charges they make , to secure it , operates in the interests of the public . Moreover , it must not be overlooked that this legislation is experimental . Even in construing the terms of a statute , courts must take notice of the history of legislation , and , out of different possible constructions , select and apply the one that best comports with the genius of our institutions and , therefore , most likely to have been the construction intended by the lawmaking power . Commerce , in its largest sense , must be deemed to be one of the most important subjects of legislation , and an intention to promote and facilitate it , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributed to Congress . The very terms of the statute , that charges must be reasonable , that discrimination must not be unjust , and that preference or advantage to any particular person , firm , corporation or locality must not be undue or unreasonable , necessarily imply that strict uniformity is not to be enforced ; but that all circumstances and conditions which reasonable men would regard as affecting the welfare of the carrying companies , and of the producers , shippers and consumers , should be considered by a tribunal appointed to carry into effect and enforce the provisions of the act . The principal purpose of the second section is to prevent unjust discrimination between shippers . It implies that , in deciding whether differences in charges , in given cases , were or were not unjust , there must be a consideration of the several questions whether the services rendered were " like and contemporaneous , " whether the kinds of  | traffic were " like , " whether the transportation was effected under " substantially similar circumstances and conditions . " To answer such questions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation into the facts ; and we think that Congress must have intended that whatever would be regarded by common carriers , apart from the operation of the statute , as matters which warranted differences in charges , ought to be considered in forming a judgment whether such differences were or were not " unjust . " Some charges might be unjust to shippers ? others might be unjust to the carriers . The rights and interests of both must , under the terms of the act , be regarded by the Commission . The third section forbids any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage in favor of any person , company , firm , corporation or locality ; and as there is nothing in the act which defines what shall be held to be due or undue , reasonable or unreasonable , such questions are questions not of law , but of fact . The mere circumstance that there is , in a given case , a preference or an advantage does not of itself show that such preference or advantage is undue or unreasonable within the meaning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjudge a common carrier to have acted unlawfully , it must ascertain the facts ; and here again we think it evident that those facts and matters which carriers , apart from any question arising under the statute , would treat as calling , in given cases , for a preference or advantage , are facts and matters which must be considered by the Commission in forming its judgment whether such preference or ad vantage is undue or unreasonable . When the section says that no locality shall be subjected to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever , it does not mean that the Commission is to regard only the welfare of the locality or community where the traffic originates , or where the goods are shipped on the cars . The welfare of the locality to which the goods are sent is also , under the terms and spirit of the act , to enter into the question ... . The conclusion that we draw from the history and language of the act , and from the decisions of our own and the English courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act is to promote and facilitate commerce by the adoption of regulations to make charges for transportation just and reasonable , and to forbid undue and unreasonable preferences or discriminations : That , in passing upon questions arising under the act , the tribunal appointed to enforce its provisions , whether the Commission or the courts , is empowered to fully consider all the  | circumstances and conditions that reasonably apply to the situation , and that , in the exercise of its jurisdiction , the tribunal may and should consider the legitimate interests as well of the carrying companies as of the traders and shippers , and in considering whether any particular locality is subjected to an undue preference or disadvantage the welfare of the communities occupying the localities where the goods are delivered is to be considered as well as that of the communities which are in the locality of the place of shipment : That among the circumstances and conditions to be considered , as well in the case of traffic originating in foreign ports as in the case of traffic originating within the limits of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in deciding whether rates and charges made at a low rate to secure foreign freights which would otherwise go by other competitive routes are or are not undue and unjust , the fair interests of the carrier companies and the welfare of the community which is to receive and consume the commodities are to be considered : That if the Commission , instead of confining its action to redressing , on complaint made by some particular person , firm , corporation or locality , some specific disregard by common carriers of provisions of the act , proposes to promulgate general orders , which thereby become rules of action to the carrying companies , the spirit and letter of the act require that such orders should have in view the purpose of promoting and facilitating commerce , and the welfare of all to be affected , as well the carriers as the traders and consumers of the country ... . The circuit court did not discuss the case at length , either as to its law or facts , but , in effect , approved the order of January 29 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from disregarding it . The decree of the circuit court of appeals is reversed ; the decree of the circuit court is also reversed ; and the cause is remanded to that court , with directions to dismiss the bill ... . MR . JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the court . These cases , brought to set aside orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission , were argued together , and present , in the main , the same questions of law . In each , carriers who were found to have unjustly  | discriminated against shippers of lumber located on an independent short line were ordered by the Commission to cease and desist from charging them higher through rates than were contemporaneously charged for like services from other points within what is called blanket territory . ... In No. 40 the Federal court for southern Mississippi perpetually enjoined the enforcement of the order issued by the Commission in Swift Lumber Co. v. Fernwood &; Gulf R. R. Co. , 61 I. C. C. 485 . In No. 38 the Federal court for Wyoming dismissed the bill ; thus sustaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ v. Director General , 64 I. C. C. 485 . Each case is here on direct appeal under the act of October 22 , 1913 , c. 32 , 38 Stat. 208 , 220 . The facts in No. 40 present most of the questions of law requiring discussion . The so-called blanket territory , which extends south from Jackson , Mississippi , to the Gulf of Mexico ( about 200 miles ) , and from the Mississippi River into Alabama , produces yellow pine lumber in quantity . Through this territory , the Illinois Central Railroad extends from New Orleans to Jackson and thence to the Ohio River crossings and leading lumber markets of the North . Partly by its main line , partly , also , by branches , and partly by connections with independent lines , it serves a large percentage of the lumber mills in the territory . From all these points on the Illinois Central main line , from all on its branches , from all on three independent short lines which connect indirectly with it , and from all on the Mississippi Central ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) the carriers have established the same through lumber rates to the northern markets , regardless of the varying distances within the blanket territory . At Fernwood , Mississippi , a little south of its Monticello branch , the Illinois Central connects with the Fernwood &; Gulf , an independent short line , on which the Swift Lumber Company has a mill at Knoxo . The distance from Knoxo to the junction is 27 miles . The joint through rate from Knoxo via Fernwood to northern points , voluntarily established by these carriers , is 2 cents per 100 pounds higher than the rate from Fernwood or any other point within the so-called blanket territory on the Illinois Central main or branch lines or on the connection mentioned above . The distance to the northern markets from many of the points on these lines is much greater than the distance from Knoxo , which lies near the center of the so-called blanket territory .  | The Swift Lumber Company instituted proceedings before the Commission against the Illinois Central , the Fernwood &; Gulf , and connecting carriers in which it attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Section 1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce , and as unjustly discriminatory , under Section 3 . The Commission found that the rates from Knoxo were not unreasonable ; but that they subject the lumber company to undue prejudice , in view of the lower rates so given competing points within the so-called blanket territory . The order directed the carriers " according as they participate in the transportation . . . to cease and desist " from the discrimination found . All the carriers except the Illinois Central and the Fernwood &; Gulf acquiesced in the order . These two joined as plaintiffs in this suit , and urge on several grounds that the order is void . First . It is contended that the order exceeds the powers of the Commission . The argument is that a carrier can not be held to have participated in an unjust discrimination unless it is a party both to the rate by which a preference has been given to others and to the higher rate which is given to the complainant ; that the Fernwood &; Gulf did not participate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lower rates from other points by which the Swift Lumber Company claims to be prejudiced ; and hence , that it can not be required to cooperate with the Illinois Central in reducing rates from Knoxo which have been found to be inherently reasonable . That , on the other hand , the Illinois Central can not be held to have subjected the Swift Lumber Company to undue prejudice , since Knoxo is not on its own lines and it is not in a position to remove , by its own act , the discrimination complained of . Neither proposition is sound . Proceedings to remove unjust discrimination are aimed directly only at the relation of rates . By joining with the Illinois Central in establishing the prejudicial through rate from Knoxo , the Fernwood &; Gulf became as much a party to the discrimination practiced as if it had joined also in the lower rates to other points which are alleged to be unduly preferential . Compare St. Louis Southwestern Ry . Co. v. United States , 245 U.S. 136 , 144 . If such were not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be had against preferential rates given by a great railway system to points on its own lines which result in undue prejudice to shippers on short lines connecting with it . Moreover , it is not true that the Illinois Central can not remove the discrimination without the cooperation of the Fernwood &; Gulf . The order leaves the carriers free to remove the discrimination  | either by making the Knoxo rate as low as that from Fernwood , or by raising the rate from Fernwood , or by giving both an intermediate rate . American Express Co. v. Caldwell , 244 U.S. 617 , 624 . The Illinois Central , acting alone , is in a position to raise the rate from Fernwood . For its main line extends from there to the Ohio River crossings , the rate-breaking point . Second . It is contended that the order of the Commission is unsustained by proof . That there is discrimination against Knoxo is not denied . The rates charged from that station are higher than those charged from competing points within the so-called blanket territory for transportation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same or longer distances , mainly over the same route ; some of these competing points being located on the Illinois Central main line , some on its branch lines , and some on independent lines . But mere discrimination does not render a rate illegal under Section 3 . Only such rates as involve unjust discrimination are obnoxious to that section . Manufacturers Ry . Co. v. United States , 246 U.S. 457 , 481 . There is no claim that any one of the evidential facts found by the Commission and relied upon to show that the discrimination was unjust , is without adequate supporting evidence . The argument is that these facts , even when supplemented by others appearing in the evidence , do not warrant the finding of the ultimate fact , that the higher rates from Knoxo are unduly prejudicial to the Swift Lumber Company to the extent that they exceed the blanket basis of rates from Fernwood ( the junction with the Illinois Central ) and other points . A carrier is entitled to initiate rates and , in this connection , to adopt such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . In the exercise of this right , the Illinois Central adopted the policy of establishing blanket , or group , rates on its main and branch lines , by which the remoter lumber-producing points were granted , regardless of distances within the territory , the same rates to northern markets as points located nearer . In the exercise of the same right to initiate rates , the Illinois Central adopted , also , the policy of granting to connecting independent short lines , and to longer connecting carriers , an allowance ( called shrinkage or absorption ) by reason of which the Illinois Central 's division of the through rate on traffic originating on connections is reduced , by the amount of the allowance , to lessen its rate for freight originating on its own line at the junction point . The Illinois Central insists that its general policy is not to grant to points on connecting lines the blanket , or junction-point rate ; and that it departs from this  | policy only when it is compelled by competition to do so . Where the through rate is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is from the junction , the share or division of the connecting carrier consists wholly of this absorption . Where the through rate from points on the connection is higher than the junction-point rate , the connecting line receives as its share an additional amount consisting of the difference between these rates . This additional amount is called the arbitrary or differential . Thus , the Fernwood &; Gulf receives a division of 4 cents per 100 pounds , consisting of a 2-cent absorption and a 2-cent arbitrary . The Illinois Central argues that the discrimination in charging a higher rate from Knoxo can not be deemed unjust since the preferential rate to other points was granted solely for the purpose of increasing its own business , and that the lower rate from Knoxo was denied solely in order to preserve its own revenues . In other words , it granted the blanket rate to all points on its own lines in order to develop business originating thereon . It declined to grant the blanket rate ( and to increase the absorption ) where the connecting line was wholly dependent upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of the higher rate . It granted the blanket rate to points on connecting lines ( and increased their absorptions ) where this was deemed necessary in order to secure traffic which might otherwise go to competitors . The effort of a carrier to obtain more business and to retain that which it had secured , proceeds from the motive of self-interest , which is recognized as legitimate ; and the fact that preferential rates were given only for this purpose relieves the carrier from any charge of favoritism or malice . But preferences may inflict undue prejudice t hough the carrier 's motives in granting them are honest . Interstate Commerce Commission v. Chicago Great Western Ry . Co. , 209 U.S. 108 , 122 . Self-interest of the carrier may not override the requirement of equality in rates . It is true that the law does not attempt to equalize opportunities among localities ( Interstate Commerce Commission v. I ) iffenbaugh , 222 U.S. 42 , 46 ) ; and that the advantage which comes to a shipper merely as a result of the position of his plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission , 237 U.S. 434 , 445 ) . To bring a difference in rates within the prohibition of Section 3 , it must be shown that the discrimination practiced is unjust when measured by the transportation standard . In other words , the difference in rates can not be held illegal , unless it is shown that it is not justified by the cost of the respective services , by their values , or  | by other transportation conditions . But the mere fact that the Knox() rate is inherently reasonable , and that the rate from competing points is not shown to be unreasonably low , does not establish that the discrimination is just . Both rates may lie within the zone of reasonablness and yet result in undue prejudice . American Express Co. v. Caldwell , 244 U.S. 617 , 624 . Every factor urged by the carrier as justifying the higher rate from Knoxo appears to have been considered by the Commission . How much weight shall be given to each must necessarily be left to it . The Commission found , among other things , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the cost of transportation from many other points which enjoy the lower rate ; that the value of the service was the same ; and that other traffic conditions incident to shipment from Knoxo were so similar to those of shipments from other points enjoying a lower rate that the prejudice to which the Swift Lumber Company had been subjected was undue and unreasonable . The innocent character of the discrimination practiced by the Illinois Central was not established , as a matter of law , by showing that the preferential rate was given to others for the purpose of developing traffic on the carrier 's own lines or for securing competitive traffic . These were factors to be considered by the Commission ; but they did not preclude a finding that the discrimination practiced is unjust . Such was the law even before Transportation Act 1920 . . . . In view of the policy and provisions of that statute , the Commission may properly have concluded that the carrier 's desire to originate traffic on its own lines , or to take traffic from a competitor , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a discrimination against a locality as theretofore . For now , the interests of the individual carrier must yield in many respects to the public need ( Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago , Burlington &; Quincy R. R. Co. , 257 U.S. 563 ; New England Divisions Case , 261 U.S. 184 ) ; and the newly conferred power to grant relief against rates unreasonably low may afford protection against injurious rate-policies of a competitor , which were theretofore uncontrollable . The order of the Commission was not an attempt to establish its own policy of rate-making . . . . It merely expressed the judgment of the Commission that existing rates subjected shippers from Knoxo to undue prejudice . The judgment so exercised , being supported by ample evidence , is conclusive . Third . The Fernwood &; Gulf contends that the order is obnoxious to the due-process clause . The argument is that even its present divi- sion of 4 cents per 100 pounds is unremunerative ; and that a smaller return would be confiscatory . To this argument there are several answers . The order does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be complied with by raising the rate from Fernwood and other points now being preferred . Moreover , a reduction of the through rate would not necessarily result in decreasing the amount of the short line 's division . The Commission may , upon application , accord to the Fernwood &; Gulf the appropriate division . New England Divisions Case , 261 U.S. 184 . There is no suggestion that the resulting reduction of the Illinois Central 's division would result in rendering the rate confiscatory as to it ... . In No. 38 , where the short line alone seeks to set aside the Commission 's order , this additional fact requires mention . The rate to the short-line points is not a joint rate , but a combination of the trunk-line rate to the junction and the short-line local rate . The distinction is without legal significance in this connection . A through route was established ; and the transportation is performed as the result of this arrangement between the carriers , expressed or implied . Undue prejudice may be inflicted as effectively by a through rate which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through rate . The power of the Commission to remove the unjust discrimination exists in both classes of cases .  | On July 25 , 1922 , the Interstate Commerce Commission , acting under Section 1 , paragraph 15 , of the Interstate Commerce Act , issued Service Order No. 23 declaring there was an emergency upon the railroad lines east of the Mississippi River and directing that coal cars should be furnished to coal mines according to a certain order of purposes numbered in classes 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 , and that no coal embraced in classes 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 should be reconsigned or diverted except for some purpose in the same class or a superior one . Hospitals were in class 2 ; automobile factories , in a lower class . The Koenig Coal Company was indicted , in a Federal district court , under Section 1 of the Elkins Act , for knowingly receiving concessions from a carrier in respect of transportation of property in interstate commerce , obtained by deceitful representation . The court sustained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MR . CHIEF JUSTICE TAFT delivered the opinion of the court : ... The first count of the indictment charged that the defendant intending to obtain a preference and priority in transportation , which it was not then lawfully entitled to receive , and to procure the coal for the use of Dodge &; Company engaged in the manufacture of automobiles and parts thereof , sent a telegraphic order to the Monitor Coal &; Coke Company of Huntington , West Virginia , asking the shipment of carloads of coal to the Koenig Coal Company at Detroit for the use of the Samaritan Hospital , that it thereby secured the furnishing by the C. &; O. Company on August 5 , 1922 , at the request of the Monitor Company , of one car suitable for the loading and transportation of coal on its line in West Virginia , which was billed and consigned in accordance with the telegraphic order ; that when it reached Detroit , the defendant diverted the car to Dodge Brothers who used the coal ,  | device of which the carriers had no knowledge .

The other grounds , dealing with the validity of Service Order No. 23 , are omitted. demurrer solely upon the same ground upon which the district court sustained it , namely , that the offense under which the indictment is drawn can not be committed without guilty knowledge and collusion of both the shipper and the carrier . . . . The court here quotes the relevant part of Section 1 of the Elkins Act. spect of transportation of any property in interstate commerce by a common carrier whereby any advantage is given or any discrimination is practiced . The facts charged bring what was done exactly within this description . It was a priority or preference in securing the transportation of coal in an emergent congestion of the traffic , It was certainly a concession , and one of value to one who under the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure that priority . The words advantage , concession , and discrimination in the statute must be construed to mean unlawful concession , unlawful advantage , unlawful discrimination . It certainly was not the intention of Congress to punish the granting or receiving of a lawful concession , a lawful advantage or a lawful discrimination . It is asked , If this was a concession , by whom was it conceded ? The answer is , By the carrier . He granted the priority and therefore he made the concession and gave the advantage and practiced the discrimination . But it was unlawful and he did not know the facts which made it so , The shipper knew them because he had secured it by his deceit and received it . What is there in the statute that releases him from guilt , because the carrier who yielded to him the concession and gave him the advantage and made the discrimination thought it was lawful this court to show that in the minds of the legislators in enacting the the Samaritan Hospital not needing or requiring the coal , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that the concession and discrimination was thus obtained by a deceit fill The demurrer challenged the indictment on various grounds , first , Counsel for the defendant in his brief and argument supports the This makes it unlawful for anyone to receive any concession in reReference is made to the debates in Congress and to decisions of  | Elkins Act , the discrimination and inequality they sought to prevent had in the past arisen chiefly from collusion between the carrier and the shipper . As practical men of course they knew that this was the way in which violations of the law were most likely to occur . But this does not at all justify the conclusion that Congress in enacting the Elkins Law intended to limit the offenses described in it to cases of collusion , if otherwise the acts charged came within the words of the statute . We have often declared that the purpose of Congress in the Elkins Law was to cut up by the roots every form of discrimination , favoritism , and inequality . . . . The citation of cases is omitted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent of the law to restrain the effect of the language used so as not to include acts exactly described when they clearly effect discrimination and inequality . Certainly no one would say that a shipper might not be convicted under the act of soliciting an unlawful concession or advantage or discrimination even though the carrier refused to extend it to him . So , too , if a carrier offers an unlawful advantage to a shipper who declines it , clearly the carrier may be indicted and punished . Collusion is not necessary in such a case . Why in this ? The act is plainly not confined to joint crimes . The general rule that criminal statutes are to be strictly construed has no application when the general purpose of the legislature is manifest and is subserved by giving the words used in the statute their ordinary meaning and thus covering the acts charged ... .  | SECTION 4 .

Statement by MR . JUSTICE SHIRAS : On the 27th day of June , 1892 , the Board of Trade of Troy , Alabama , filed a complaint before the Interstate Commerce Commission at Washington , District of Columbia , against the Alabama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their connections , claiming that in the rates charged for transportation of property by the railroad companies mentioned and their connecting lines there is a discrimination against the town of Troy , in violation of the terms and provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act of Congress of 1887.  | The general ground of complaint is , that Troy being in active competition for business with Montgomery , the defendant lines of railway unjustly discriminate in their rates against the former , and give the latter an undue preference or advantage in respect to certain commodities and classes of traffic . The specific charges insisted on at the hearing , and to which the testimony relates , are : 1 . That the Alabama Midland Railway and the defendant roads forming lines with it from Baltimore , New York , and the east to Troy and Montgomery charge and collect a higher rate on shipments of class goods from those cities to Troy than on such shipments through Troy to Montgomery ; the latter being the longer distance point by fifty-two miles . 2 . That the Alabama Midland Railway and Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of Montgomery in charging and collecting $3.22 per ton to Troy on phosphate rock shipped from the South Carolina and Florida fields and only $3 per ton on such shipments to Montgomery , the longer distant point by both of said roads : and that all phosphate rock carried from said fields to Montgomery over the road of the Alabama Midland has to be hauled through Troy . 3 . That the rates on cotton , as established by said two roads and their connections , on shipments to the Atlantic seaports , Brunswick , Savannah , and Charleston , unjustly discriminate against Troy and in favor of Montgomery , in that the rate per hundred pounds from Troy is 47 cents , and that from Montgomery , the longer distance point , is only 40 cents , and that such shipments from Montgomery over the road of the Alabama Midland have to pass through Troy ... . The Commission , having heard this complaint on the evidence theretofore taken , ordered , on the 15th day of August , 1893 , the roads participating in the traffic involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charging , demanding , collecting , or receiving any greater compensation in the aggregate for services rendered in such transportation than is specified , as follows , to wit : .. . 3 . On shipments of cotton from Troy aforesaid for export through the Atlantic seaports , to wit , Brunswick , Savannah , Charleston , West Point , or Norfolk , no higher rate of charge to these ports than is charged and collected on such shipments from Montgomery aforesaid ... . 5 . On shipments of class goods from New York , Baltimore , or other northeastern points to Troy aforesaid , no higher rate of charge than  | is charged and collected on such shipments through Troy to Montgomery aforesaid. 6 . On shipments of phosphate rock from South Carolina and Florida fields to Troy aforesaid , no higher rate of charge than is charged and collected on such shipments through Troy to Montgomery aforesaid . The defendants having failed to heed these orders , the Commission thereupon filed this bill of complaint in the circuit court of the United States for the middle district of Alabama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the hearing in said court the bill of complaint was dismissed , and complainant , the Interstate Commerce Commission , appealed the cause to the United States circuit court of appeals for the fifth judicial circuit , at New Orleans , Louisiana . And , thereupon , in said last-named court , on the second day of June , 1896 , the decree of the said circuit court of the United States for the middle district of Alabama was in all things duly affirmed ; and from this judgment and decree the appellant has appealed to this court ... . MR . JUSTICE SHIRAS delivered the opinion of the court : .. . Errors are assigned to the action of the court in having failed and refused to affirm and enforce the report and opinion of the Commission , wherein it was found and decided , among other things , that the defendant common carriers which participate in the transportation of class goods to Troy from Louisville , St. Louis , and Cincinnati , and from New York , Baltimore , and other northeastern points , and the defendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from South Carolina and Florida to Troy , and the defendant common carriers which participate in the transportation of cotton from Troy to the ports of New Orleans , Brunswick , Savannah , Charleston , West Point , or Norfolk , as local shipments or for export , have made greater charges under substantially similar circumstances and conditions , for the shorter distance to or from Troy than for longer distances over the same lines in the same direction , and have unjustly discriminated in rates against Troy , and subjected said place and dealers and shippers therein to undue and unreasonable prejudice and disadvantage in favor of Montgomery , Eufaula , Columbus , and other places and localities and dealers and shippers therein , in violation of the provisions of the Act to Regulate Commerce . Whether competition between lines of transportation to Mont gomery , Eufaula , and Columbus justifies the giving to those cities a preference or advantage in rates over Troy , and , if so , whether such a state of facts justifies a departure from equality of rates without  | authority from the Interstate Commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act , are questions of construction of the statute , and are to be determined before we reach the question of fact in this case . It is contended , in the briefs filed on behalf of the Interstate Commerce Commission , that the existence of rival lines of transportation , and , consequently , of competition for the traffic , are not facts to be considered by the Commission , or by the courts , when determining whether property transported over the same line is carried under " substantially similar circumstances and conditions , " as that phrase is found in the 4th section of the act . Such , evidently , was not the construction put upon this provision of the statute by the Commission itself in the present case , for the record discloses that the Commission made some allowance for the alleged dissimilarity of circumstances and conditions , arising out of competition and situation , as affecting transportation to Montgomery and Troy respectively , and that , among the errors assigned , is one complaining that the court erred in not holding that the rates prescribed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissimilarity . So , too , in case Re Louisville &; Nashville R.R. Co. , 1 I. C. C. 77 , in discussing the long and short haul clause , it was said by the Commission , per Judge Cooley , that " it is impossible to resist the conclusion that in finally rejecting the long and short haul clause ' of the House bill , which prescribed an inflexible rule , not to be departed from in any case , and retaining in substance the 4th section as it had passed the Senate , both Houses understood that they were not adopting a measure of strict prohibition in respect to charging more for the shorter than for the longer distance ; but that they were , instead , leaving the door open for exceptions in certain cases , and among others in cases where the circumstances and conditions of the traffic were affected by the element of competition , and where exceptions might be a necessity if the competition was to continue . And water competition was beyond doubt especially in view . " It is , no doubt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia v. Clyde Steamship Co. et al. , 5 I. C. C. Rep. 327 , the Commission somewhat modified their holding in the Louisville &; Nashville Railroad Company Case , just cited , by attempting to restrict the competition that it is allowable to consider to the cases of competition with water carriers , competition with foreign railroads , competition  | with railroad lines wholly in a single state ; but the principle that competition in such cases is to be considered is affirmed . That competition is one of the most obvious and effective circumstances that make the conditions under which a long and short haul is performed , substantially dissimilar , and as such must have been in the contemplation of Congress in the passage of the Act to Regulate Commerce , has been held by many of the circuit courts ... . But the question whether competition as affecting rates is an element for the Commission and the courts to consider in applying the provisions of the Act to Regulate Commerce is not an open question in this court . In Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baltimore &; O. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , approving observations made by Jackson , circuit judge ( 43 Fed . 37 ) , that the Act to Regulate Commerce was " not designed , . . . to prevent competition between different roads , or to interfere with the customary arrangements made by railway companies for reduced fares in consideration of increased mileage , where such reduction did not operate as an unjust discrimination against other persons traveling over the road ; . . . ( that ) it was not intended to ignore the principle that one can sell at wholesale cheaper than at retail ; ( that ) it is not all discriminations or preferences that fall within the inhibition of the statute ; only such as are unjust or unreasonable " ; and accordingly , it was held that the issue by a railway company , engaged in interstate commerce , of a " party-rate ticket " for the transportation of ten or more persons from a place situated in one state or territory to a place situated in another state or territory , at a rate less than that charged to a single individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not thereby make " an unjust or unreasonable charge " against such individual within the meaning of the first section of the Act to Regulate Commerce ; nor make " an unjust discrimination " against him within the meaning of the second section ; not give " an undue or unreasonable preference or advantage " to the purchasers of the party-rate ticket within the meaning of the third section . In Texas &; Pac . Railway v. Interstate Commerce Commission , 162 U.S. 197 , it was held that " in passing upon questions arising under the act , the tribunal appointed to enforce its provisions , whether the Commission or the courts , is empowered to fully consider all the circumstances and conditions that reasonably apply to the situation , and that , in the exercise of its jurisdiction , the tribunal may and should consider the legitimate interests as well of the carrying companies as  | of the traders and shippers , and in considering whether any particular locality is subjected to an undue preference or disadvantage the welfare of the communities occupying the localities where the goods are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the communities which are in the locality of the place of shipment . That among the circumstances and conditions to be considered , as well in the case of traffic originating in foreign ports as in the case of traffic originating within the limits of the United States , competition that affects rates should be considered , and in deciding whether rates and charges made at a low rate to secure foreign freights which would otherwise go by other competitive routes are or are not undue and unjust , the fair interests of the carrier companies and the welfare of the community which is to receive and consume the commodities are to be considered . " .. . In order further to guard against any misapprehension of the scope of our decision it may be well to observe that we do not hold that the mere fact of competition , no matter what its character or extent , necessarily relieves the carrier from the restraint of the third and fourth sections , but only that these sections are not so stringent and imperative as to exclude in all cases the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undue or unreasonable preference or advantage , " or what are " substantially similar circumstances and conditions . " The competition may in some cases be such as , having due regard to the interests of the public and of the carrier , ought justly to have effect upon the rates , and in such cases there is no absolute rule which prevents the Commission or the courts from taking that matter into consideration . It is further contended , on behalf of the appellant , that the courts below erred in holding , in effect , that competition of carrier with carrier , both subject to the Act to Regulate Commerce , will justify a departure from the rule of the fourth section of the act without authority from the Interstate Commerce Commission , under the proviso to that section . In view of the conclusion hereinbefore reached , the proposition comes to this , that , when circumstances and conditions are substantially dissimilar , the railway companies can only avail themselves of such a situation by an application to the Commission ... . The claim now made for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relieve railroad companies from the operation of the long and short haul clause on the account of the existence of competition , or any other similar element which would make its application  | unfair , is the Commission itself , which is bound to consider the question , upon application by the railroad company , but whose decision is discretionary and unreviewable ... . This view of the scope of the proviso to the fourth section does not appear to have ever been acted upon or enforced by the Commission . On the contrary , in the case of Re Louisville &; Nashville R.R. Company v. Interstate Commerce Commission , 1 I. C. C. 57 , the Commission , through Judge Cooley , said , in speaking of the effect of the introduction into the fourth section of the words " under substantially similar circumstances and conditions , " and of the meaning of the proviso : " that which the act does not declare unlawful must remain lawful if it was so before ; and that which it fails to forbid the carrier is left at liberty to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater compensation for the shorter than for the longer haul is seen to be forbidden only when both are under substantially similar circumstances and conditions ; and , therefore , if in any case the carrier , without first obtaining an order of relief , shall depart from the general rule , its doing so will not alone convict it of illegality , since if the circumstances and conditions of the two hauls are dissimilar the statute is not violated . . . . Beyond question the carrier must judge for itself what are the substantially similar circumstances and conditions ' which preclude the special rate , rebate , or drawback , which is made unlawful by the second section , since no tribunal is empowered to judge for it until after the carrier has acted , and then only for the purpose of determining whether its action constitutes a violation of law . The carrier judges on peril of the consequences ; but the special rate , rebate , or drawback which it grants is not illegal when it turns out that the circumstances and conditions were not such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must also , when using the same words in the fourth section , have intended that the carrier whose privilege was in the same way limited by them should in the same way act upon its judgment of the limiting circumstances and conditions . " The view thus expressed has been adopted in several of the circuit courts ; . . . and we do not think the courts below erred in following it in the present case . We are unable to suppose that Congress intended , by the fourth section and the proviso thereto , to forbid the common carriers , in cases where the circumstances and conditions are substantially dissimilar , from making different rates until and unless the Commission shall authorize them so to do , much less do we think that it was the intention of Congress that the decision of the Commission ,  | if applied to , could not be reviewed by the courts . The provisions of Section 16 of the act , which authorizes the court to " proceed to hear and determine the matter speedily as a court of equity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary suits in equity , but in such manner as to do justice in the premises , and to this end , such court shall have power , if it think fit , to direct and prosecute in such mode and by such persons as it may appoint , all such inquiries as the court may think needful to enable it to form a just judgment in the matter of such petition , " extend as well to an inquiry or proceeding under the fourth section as to those arising under the other sections of the act . Upon these conclusions , that competition between rival routes is one of the matters which may lawfully be considered in making rates , and that substantial dissimilarity of circumstances and conditions may justify common carriers in charging greater compensation for the transportation of like kinds of property for a shorter than for a longer distance over the same line , we are brought to consider whether , upon the evidence in the present case , the courts below erred in dismissing the Interstate Commerce Commission 's complaint . As the third section of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person or locality , does not define what , under that section , shall constitute a preference or advantage to be undue or unreasonable , and as the fourth section , which forbids the charging or receiving greater compensation in the aggregate for the transportation of like kinds of property for a shorter than for a longer distance over the same line , under substantially similar circumstances and conditions , does not define or describe in what the similarity or dissimilarity of circumstances and conditions shall consist , it can not be doubted that whether , in particular instances , there has been an undue or unreasonable prejudice or preference , or whether the circumstances and conditions of the carriage have been substantially similar or otherwise , are questions of fact depending on the matters proved in each case ... . Coming at last to the questions of fact in this case , we encounter a large amount of conflicting evidence . It seems undeniable as the effect of the evidence on both sides , that an actual dissimilarity of circumstances and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the volume of their respective trade and the competition , affecting rates , occasioned by rival routes by land and water . Indeed , the Commission itself recognized such a state of facts by making an  | allowance in the rates prescribed , for dissimilarity resulting from . competition , and it was contended on behalf of the Commission , both in the courts below and in this court , that the competition did not justify the discriminations against Troy to the extent shown , and that the allowance made therefor by the Commission was a due allowance . The issue is thus restricted to the question of the preponderance of the evidence on the respective sides of the controversy . We have read the evidence disclosed by the record , and have endeavored to weigh it with the aid of able and elaborate discussions by the respective counsel . No useful purpose would be served by an attempt to formally state and analyze the evidence , but the result is that we are not convinced that the courts below erred in their estimate of the evidence , and that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they proceeded in the application of the evidence . The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is accordingly affirmed . MR . JUSTICE HARLAN dissenting : I dissent from the opinion and judgment in this case . Taken in connection with other decisions defining the powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission , the present decision , it seems to me , goes far to make that Commission a useless body for all practical purposes , and to defeat many of the important objects designed to be accomplished by the various enactments of Congress relating to intersting commerce . The Commission was established to protect the public against the improper practices of transportation companies engaged in commerce among the several states . It has been left , it is true , with power to make reports , and to issue protests . But it has been shorn , by judicial interpretation , of authority to do anything of an effective character . It is denied many of the powers which , in my judgment , were intended to be conferred upon it . Besides , the acts of Congress are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interstate commerce at the mercy of competing railroad companies engaged in such commerce . The judgment in this case , if I do not misapprehend its scope and effect , proceeds upon the ground that railroad companies , when competitors for interstate business at certain points , may , in order to secure traffic for and at those points , establish rates that will enable them to accomplish that result , although such rates may discriminate against intermediate points , Under such an interpretation of the statutes in question , they may  | well be regarded as recognizing the authority of competing railroad companies engaged in interstate commerce ? when their interests will be subserved thereby ? to build up favored centers of population at the expense of the business of the country at large . I can not believe that Congress intended any such result , nor do I think that its enactments , properly interpreted , would lead to such a result .  | SECTION 4 . That it shall be unlawful for any common carrier subject to the provisions of this Act to charge or receive any greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of like kind of property , for a shorter than for a longer distance over the same line or route in the same direction , the shorter being included within the longer distance , or to charge any greater compensation as a through route than the aggregate of the intermediate rates subject to the provisions of this Act ; but this shall not be construed as authorizing any common carrier within the terms of this Act to charge or receive as great compensation for a shorter as for a longer distance : Provided , however , That upon application to the Interstate Commerce Commission , such common carrier may in special cases , after investigation , be authorized by the Commission to charge less for longer than for shorter distances for the transportation of passengers or property ; and the Commission may from time to time prescribe the extent to which such designated common carrier may be relieved from the operation of this section . Provided , further , That no rates or charges lawfully existing at the time of the passage of this amendatory Act shall be required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to the expiration of six months after the passage of this Act , nor in any case where application shall have been filed before the Commission , in accordance with the provisions of this section , until a determination of such application by the Commission . Whenever a carrier by railroad shall in competition with a water route or routes reduce the rates on the carriage of any species of freight to or from competitive points , it shall not be permitted to increase such rates unless after hearing by the Interstate Commerce Commission it shall be found that such proposed increase rests upon changed conditions other than the elimination of water competition.I  | MR . CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the court : We shall seek to confine our statement to matters which are essential to the decision of the case . The provisions of section four of the Act to Regulate Commerce dealing with what is known as the long and short haul clause , the power of carriers because of dissimilarity of circumstances and conditions to deviate from the exactions of such clause , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such subjects , were materially amended by the act of June 18 , 1910 . Following the form prescribed by the Commission after the amendment in question , the seventeen carriers who are appellees on this record made to the Interstate Commerce Commission their " application for relief from provisions of fourth section of amended commerce act in connection with the following tariffs . " The tariffs annexed to the applications covered the whole territory from the Atlantic seaboard to the Pacific coast and the Gulf of Mexico , including all interior points , and embracing practically the entire country , and the petition asked the Interstate Commerce Commission for authority to continue all rates shown on the tariffs from the Atlantic seaboard to the Pacific coast , and from the Pacific coast to the Atlantic seaboard , and to and from interior points lower than rates concurrently in effect from and to intermediate points . It was stated in the petition : This application is based upon the desire of the interested carriers to continue the present method of making rates lower at the more distant points than at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of competition of various water carriers and of carriers partly by water and partly by rail operating from Pacific coast ports to Atlantic seaboard ports ; competition of various water carriers operating to foreign countries from Pacific coast ports ; and competition of the products of foreign countries with the products of the Pacific coast ; competition of the products of Pacific coast territory with the products of other sections of the country ; competition of Canadian rail carriers not subject to the Interstate Commerce Act ; competition of the products of Canada moving by Canadian carriers with the products of the United States ; rates established via the shorter or more direct routes , but applied also via the longer or more circuitous routes .  | After full hearing the Commission refused to grant unqualifiedly the prayer of the petition , but entered an order permitting in some respects a charge of a lower rate for the longer haul to the Pacific coast than was asked for intermediate points provided a proportionate relation was maintained between the lower rate for the longer haul to the Pacific coast and the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the basis of percentages which were fixed . For the purposes of the order in question the Commission in substance adopted a division of the entire territory into separate zones , which division had been resorted to by the carriers for the purposes of the establishment of the rates in relation to which the petition was filed . Refusing to comply with this order the carriers commenced proceedings in the commerce court praying a decree enjoining the enforcement of the fourth section as amended on the ground of its repugnancy to the Constitution of the United States , and of the order as being in any event violative of the amended section as properly construed . An interlocutory injunction was ordered . The defendants moved to dismiss , and , on the overruling of the motions , appealed from the interlocutory order , the case being No. 136 . Subsequently , upon the election of the defendants to plead no further , a final decree was entered and appealed from , that appeal being No. 162 . It suffices at this moment to say that all the contentions which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such contentions , including every argument urged to uphold , on the one hand , or to overthrow on the other , the action of the Commission , as well as every reason relied upon to challenge the action of the court or to sustain its judgment , are all reducible to the follow ing propositions : ( a ) The absolute want of power of the court below to deal with the subject involved in the complaint because controversies concerning the fourth section of the Act to Regulate Commerce of the nature here presented were , by an express statutory provision , excluded from the cognizance of the court below . ( b ) That even if this be not the case , the action of the Commission which was complained of was purely negative , and therefore not within the cognizance of the court , be cause not inherently justiciable. ( c ) That , correctly interpreting the fourth section , the order made by the Commission was absolutely void because wholly beyond the scope of any power conferred by the fourth section as amended . ( d ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Commission was within the reach of its statutory power ,  | t here was intermingled in the order such an exertion of authority not delegated as to cause the whole order to be void . ( e ) That the order of the Commission was void even if the fourth section be interpreted as conferring the authority which the Commission exerted , since , under that assumption , the fourth section as amended was repugnant lo the Constitution . All the propositions , even including the jurisdictional ones , are concerned with and depend upon the construction of the fourth section as amended , and we proceed to consider and pass upon that subject and every other question in the case under four separate headings : ( 1 ) the meaning of the statute ; ( 2 ) its constitutionality ; ( 3 ) the jurisdiction of the court ; ( 4 ) the validity of the order in the light of the statute as interpreted . 1 . The meaning of the statute ... . Before considering the amended text we state briefly some of the more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of private right , of public duty and policy which it embodies , because to do so will go a long way to remove any doubt as to the amended text , and will moreover serve to demonstrate t he intent of the legislative mind in enacting the amendment . Almost immediately after the adoption of the Act to Regulate Commerce in 1887 the Interstate Commerce Commission , in considering t lie meaning of the law and the scope of the duties imposed on the Commission in enforcing it , reached the conclusion that the words " under substantially similar circumstances and conditions " of the fourth section dominated the long and short haul clause and empowered carriers to primarily determine the existence of the required dissimilarity of circumstances and conditions , and consequently to exact in the event of such difference a lesser charge for the longer than was exacted for the shorter haul , and that competition which materially affected the rate of carriage to a particular point was a dissimilar circumstance and condition within the meaning of the act . We say primarily , because of course it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end just stated was subject to t he supervision and control of the Interstate Commerce Commission the exertion of the powers conferred upon it by the statute , and especially in view of the authority stated in the fourth section . In considering the act comprehensively it was pointed out that the generic provisions against preference and discrimination expressed in the second and third sections of the act were all-embracing , and were  | therefore operative upon the fourth section as well as upon all other provisions of the act . But it was pointed out that where , within the purview of the fourth section , it had lawfully resulted that the lesser rate was charged for a longer than was exacted for a shorter haul , such exaction , being authorized , could not be a preference or discrimination and therefore illegal . Re Louisville &; N. R. Co. , 1 I. C. C. Rep. 31 . These comprehensive views announced at the inception as a matter of administrative construction were subsequently sustained by many decisions of this court . . . . We observe , moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive conditions authorized carriers to lower their rates to a particular place , the right to meet the competition by lowering rates to such place was not confined to shipments made from the point of origin of the competition , but empowered all carriers , in the interest of freedom of commerce and to afford enlarged opportunity to shippers , to accept , if they chose to do so , shipments to such competitive points at lower rates than their general tariff rates : a right which came aptly to be described as " market competition " because the practice served to enlarge markets and develop the freedom of traffic and intercourse . It is to be observed , however , that the right thus conceded was not absolute , because its exercise was only permitted provided the rates were not so lowered as to be nonremunerative , and thereby cast an unnecessary burden upon other shippers . East Tennessee , V. &; G. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission , 181 U.S. 1 . As the statute as thus construed imposed no obligation to carry to the competitive point at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is obvious that the statute regarded the rights of private ownership , and sought to impose no duty conflicting therewith . It is also equally clear that in permitting the carrier to judge primarily of the competitive conditions , and to meet them at election , the statute lodged in the carrier the right to exercise a primary judgment concerning a matter of public concern broader than the mere question of the duty of a carrier to carry for a reasonable rate on the one hand , and of the right of the shipper , on the other , to compel carriage at such rate , since the power of primary judgment which the statute conferred concerned in a broad sense the general public interest with reference to both persons and places , ? considerations all of which , therefore , in their ultimate aspects , came within the competency of legislative regulation . It was apparent that the power thus conferred was primary , not absolute , since its exertion by the carrier was made by the statute the sub- ject both of administrative control and ultimate judicial review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself serves to make manifest the public nature of the attributes conferred upon the carrier by the original fourth section . Indeed , that in so far as the statute empowered the carrier to judge as to the dissimilarity of circumstances and conditions for the purpose of relief from the long and short haul clause , it but gave the carrier the power to exert a judgment as to things public , was long since pointed out by this court . Texas &; P. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission , 162 U.S. 197 , 218 . With the light afforded by the statements just made we come to consider the amendment . It is certain that the fundamental change which it makes is the omission of the substantially similar circumstances and conditions clause , thereby leaving the long and short haul clause in a sense unqualified except in so far as the section gives the right to the carrier to apply to the Commission for authority " to charge less for longer than for shorter distances for the transportation of persons or property , " and gives the Commission authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which such designated common carrier may be relieved from the operation of this section . " From the failure to insert any word in the amendment tending to exclude the operation of competition as adequate under proper circumstances to justify the awarding of relief from the long and short haul clause , and there being nothing which minimizes or changes the application of the preference and discrimination clauses of the second and third sections , it follows that in substance the amendment intrinsically states no new rule or principle , but simply shifts the powers conferred by the section as it originally stood ; that is , it takes from the carriers the deposit of public power previously lodged in them and vests it in the Commission as a primary instead of a reviewing function . In other words , the elements of judgment , or , so to speak , the system of law by which judgment is to be controlled , remains unchanged , but a different tribunal is created for the enforcement of the existing law . This being true , as we think it plainly is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carrier primarily to meet competitive conditions in any point of view by charging a lesser rate for a longer than for a shorter haul has ceased to exist , because to do so , in the absence of some authority , would not only be inimical to the provision of the fourth section , but would be in conflict with the preference and discrimination clauses of the second and third sections . But while the public power , so to speak , previously lodged in the carrier , is thus withdrawn and reposed in the Commis- sion , the right of carriers to seek and obtain under authorized circumstances the sanction of the Commission to charge a lower rate for a longer than for a shorter haul because of competition or for other adequate reasons is expressly preserved , and , if not , is , in any event , by necessary implication , granted . And as a correlative the authority of the Commission to grant on request the right sought is made by the statute to depend upon the facts established and the judgment of that body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whether the request should be granted compatibly with a due consideration of the private and public interests concerned , and in view of the preference and discrimination clauses of the second and third sections . 2 . The alleged repugnancy of the section as amended to the Constitution . But if the amendment has this meaning , it is insisted that it is repugnant to the Constitution for various reasons which , superficially considered , seem to be distinct , but which really are all so interwoven that we consider and dispose of them as one . The argument is that the statute , as correctly construed , is but a delegation to the Commission of legislative power which Congress was incompetent to make . But the contention is without merit ... . The mere statement of the contention , in the light of its environment , suffices to destroy it . How can it otherwise be since the argument as applied to the case before us is this : that the authority in question was validly delegated so long as it was lodged in carriers , but ceased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carriers for the purpose of being lodged in a public administrative body ? Indeed , when it is considered that , in last analysis , the argument is advanced to sustain the right of carriers to exert the public power which it is insisted is not susceptible of delegation , it is apparent that the contention is self-contradictory , since it reduces itself to an effort to sustain the right to delegate a power by contending that the power is not capable of being delegated ... . Accurately testing this final result of the argument it is clear that it exclusively rests upon convictions concerning the impolicy of having taken from carriers , intimately and practically acquainted as they are with the complex factors entering into rate making and moreover impelled to equality of treatment as they must be by the law of selfinterest operating upon them as a necessary result of the economic forces to which they are subjected , and having lodged the power in an official administrative body which , in the nature of things , must act , however conscientiously , from conceptions based upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this does not involve a grievance based upon this construction of application of the fourth section as amended , but upon the wisdom of the legislative judgment which was brought into play in adopting the amendment , ? a subject with which we have nothing in the world to do . It is said in the argument on behalf of one of the carriers that as in substance and effect the duty is imposed upon the Commission in a proper case to refuse an application , therefore the law is void because in such a contingency the statute would amount to an imperative enforcement of the long and short haul clause and would be repugnant to the Constitution ... . The contention by necessary implication assails the numerous cases which , from the enactment of the Act to Regulate Commerce down to the present time , have involved the adequacy of the conditions advanced by carriers for justifying their departure from the long and short haul clause ... . 3 . The jurisdiction of the court .... The court in the portion of the text that follows affirms the jurisdiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject under consideration. 4 . The validity of the order in the light of the statute as interpreted ... . The main insistence is that there was no power after recognizing the existence of competition and the right to charge a lesser rate to the competitive point than to intermediate points to do more than fix a reasonable rate to the intermediate points ; that is to say , that under the power transferred to it by the section as amended , the Commission was limited to ascertaining the existence of competition , and to authorizing the carrier to meet it , without any authority to do more than exercise its general powers concerning the reasonableness of rates at all points . But this proposition is directly in conflict with the statute as we have construed it , and with the plain purpose and intent manifested by its enactment . To uphold the proposition it would be necessary to say that the powers which were essential to the vivification and beneficial realization of the authority transferred had evaporated in the process of transfer , and hence that the power perished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferred . As the prime object of the transfer was to vest the Commission , within the scope of the discretion imposed , and subject , in the nature of things , to the limitations arising from the character of the duty exacted and flowing from the other provisions of the act , with authority to consider competitive condi- Lions and their relation to persons and places , necessarily there went with the power the right to do that by which alone it could be exerted , and therefore a consideration of the one and the other , and the establishment of the basis by percentages was within the power granted ... As we have pointed out , though somewhat modified , the zones .. . selected by the Commission were in substance the same as those previously fixed by the carriers as the basis of the rate-making which was included in the tariffs which were under investigation , and therefore we may put that subject out of view . Indeed , except as to questions of power , there is no contention in the argument as to the inequality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preference or discrimination resulting from the action taken . But be this as it may , in view of the findings of the Commission as to the system of rates prevailing in the tariffs which were before it , of the inequalities and burdens engendered by such system of the possible aggrandizement unnaturally beyond the limits produced by competition in favor of the competitive points and against other points by the tariff in question , ? facts which we accept , and which indeed are unchallenged , ? we see no ground for saying that the order was not sustained by the facts upon which it was based , or that it exceeded the powers which the statute conferred , or transcended the limits of the sound legal discretion which it lodged in the Commission when acting upon the subject before it . It results that the Commerce Court , in enjoining the order of the Commission , was wrong , and its decree to that end must therefore be reversed , and the case be remanded to the proper district court , with directions to dismiss the bill for want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These proceedings comprise fourth-section applications of the transcontinental lines proposing to establish from and to the Pacific-coast terminals lower rates than are in effect to and from intermediate points on traffic having origin or destination in the so-called defined territories lying , roughly speaking , east of the Rocky Mountains . The Pacific-coast terminals in question are ports of call in California , Oregon , Washington , and British Columbia for steamships plying between those ports , on the one hand , and Atlantic and Gulf ports , on the other , through the Panama Canal . The intermediate territory , hereinafter referred to as intermountain territory , embraces such typical points as Spokane ( Washington ) , Reno ( Nevada ) , Salt Lake City ( Utah ) , and Ph0enix ( Arizona ) . On many commodities the intermediate territory extends east of Helena ( Montana ) , Denver ( Colorado ) , Albuquerque ( New Mexico ) , and El Paso ( Texas ) . The proposed reduced rates are grounded on the low rates by steamship lines between the Atlantic and Gulf ports and the Pacific ports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereunder . Except as otherwise noted , the rates of the applicant carriers are the same over all routes , and apply not only all rail , but , so far as New York City is concerned , also in connection with the Southern Pacific Company 's steamship line operating between that point and New Orleans ( Louisiana ) , and Galveston ( Texas ) . For convenience , the rates of the applicant carriers will be referred to as the rail rates and the applicants as the rail lines . The steamship companies will be re ferred to as the water lines , and their rates or those applying in con nection therewith , plus the incidental charges hereinafter explained , will be referred to as the water charges . All rates and charges are stated in cents per 100 pounds , except as otherwise noted . They do not include the general reductions of 1922.  | This application proposes the establishment of reduced rates to the Pacific-coast terminals on various commodities from all points in the defined territories . Applications covering this same general traffic have been made at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower rates to the terminals than to intermediate points was generally permitted until March 15 , 1918 . Railroad Commission of Nevada v. S. P. Co. , 21 I. C. C. 329 ; City of Spokane v. N. P. Ry . Co. , 21 I. C. C. 400 ; Commodity Rates to Pacific Coast Terminals , 32 I. C. C. 611 ; 34 I. C. C. 13 , and other cases . On the above date all departures from the long and short haul rule in west-bound transcontinental rates were removed under the decisions in Reopening Fourth Section Applications , 4O I. C. C. 35 , and Transcontinental Rates , 46 I. C. C. 236 . It was there found that due to the withdrawal of ships for use in the transatlantic service water competition between the Atlantic and Pacific ports was no longer a compelling force ; and we found that the maintenance of lower rates to the coast than to intermediate points unduly preferred the coast . We denied relief from the long and short haul rule , and expressed the view that the commodity rates in certain instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been ; that is , made lower to the intermediate points than to the terminals . The rates on certain high-grade traffic , including such articles as pianos and rubber tires , were graded ; but , generally speaking , the rates to the terminals were increased to the extent necessary to put the terminals on a parity with the intermediate points , resulting in a blanket extending several hundred miles inland from the Pacific coast . This adjustment was approved in Transcontinental Commodity Rates , 48 I. C. C. 79 . It was subjected to the general increases of 1918 and 1920 , and the general reduction of 1922 , but otherwise has remained substantially unchanged up to this time . The failure of the carriers to grade more of their rates brought forth a complaint for intermountain territory which alleged that the rates to these points were unreasonable , and unduly prejudicial as compared with the rates to the terminals . We found that the rates , in general , were not unreasonable or unduly prejudicial and dismissed the complaint . Intermediate Rate Asso. v. Director General , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We held that there was some water competition  | and expressed the view that strong water competition was likely to be resumed within a short time . A few months later , in August , 1921 , this application was filed . Iearings were had at various points throughout the country during November , December , and January following . The record shows that for some time previous to the hearings traffic destined to the Pacific coast had been moving by water in heavy volume . Competition was keener and the water service more efficient than at any time before the war . The rail lines and the water lines , respectively , upon request furnished statements of the tonnage moved from the defined territories to the Pacific coast during June , July , and August , 1921 . These statements show that considerably more than half the traffic in most all of the commodities involved was shipped by water . As to some commodi - ties the movement was nearly all by water . All but a small portion of the water-borne traffic originated in and east of Buffalo-Pittsburgh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchases in that part of the East which is tributary to the water lines and from which they can secure low rates . The movement by water may be relatively greater now than it was during the period of the hearings , for the water service was then only beginning to develop on a large scale ... . The lines operated in this service over seventy-five steamships , and the number of steamships was increasing . Most of them plied from the North Atlantic ports . Several of the stronger lines maintained regular sailing schedules , the ships departing whether fully loaded or not . Sailings from the North Atlantic ports were at least , three or four per week . Two of the lines , the Luckenbach and the Pacific Caribbean Gulf Line , maintained service from the Gulf ports . They had a total of about a dozen ships in this latter service . The sailings were not as regular as from the North Atlantic ports , the ships staying in port until they obtained full cargoes . Sailings averaged about three per month . Most of the ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and afforded efficient service . Many of them were designed especially for handling coast-to-coast business . The sailing time of the best ships between New York and San Francisco , California , ranged from about eighteen to twenty-one days . However , from and to the northern ports , for instance , from Boston , Massachusetts , to Vancouver , British Columbia , the sailing time was longer , as stops of several days were made at other ports en route .  | Comparatively little of this water-borne traffic originated at the ports . It generally moved via the North Atlantic ports . The small portion which moved from the points west of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh district went either to the North Atlantic ports or to the Gulf ports for transshipment . The traffic via the Gulf was not heavy . The Gulf lines depended mainly on iron and steel from the Birmingham , Alabama , district and on commodities produced near the Gulf , such as rosin and turpentine . They drew comparatively little traffic from the North and Middle West . Some of that traffic moved by rail to St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thence by the barges of the Mississippi-Warrior Service , operated by the War Department , to New Orleans . This line operated excellent steel barges , and , on the southbound movement particularly , drifting with the current , made fairly good time , averaging about nine days to New Orleans . Sailings from Cairo , the winter port , were at the rate of about two per week , each consisting of a fleet of six barges . This line is used mainly for heavy commodities . Its traffic destined to the Pacific coast has been rather light . During the fifteen months ' period from October , 1920 , to December , 1921 , inclusive , there were only about 100 carloads , principally canned goods , starch , and iron and steel from Illinois points and St. Louis . At the time the application was filed all traffic from interior points that was shipped by the water lines was charged local rates to the ports . Effective February 15 , 1922 , the lines from Chicago , Illinois , and related points , principally in Illinois , proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destined to the Pacific coast through the Panama Canal , equal to the local rates from Chicago to New York City . The obvious purpose was to put the Gulf ports on a rate parity with the North Atlantic ports as to traffic to the Pacific coast . These rates were originally suspended by us , but were permitted to become effective April 1 , 1922 . The Mississippi-Warrior Service maintains lower rates than the all-rail lines to the Gulf , the differential from all points being 20 per cent of the St. Louis-New Orleans rail rate . This line also publishes joint through all-water rates from St. Louis and Memphis , Tennessee , to the Pacific coast via New Orleans and the steamship lines . Rates from Chicago and points in the Middle West over this route generally are made on the basis of rail rates to St. Louis and the water charges beyond , or on the basis of the proportionals to New Orleans plus the water charges beyond ....  | The rail lines contend that the proposed rates are no lower than are necessary to yield them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business seems to be regarded as such an amount thereof as can be secured under equality of opportunity . Equality of opportunity may be defined as such an adjustment of rates as would cause a busi ness man , under ordinary circumstances , to reach the conclusion after considering service and rates that he would ordinarily be as willing to send traffic by water as by rail , or vice versa . The commodities here considered are not the only ones as to which there is substantial competition with the water lines . It was the declared purpose of the carriers to be conservative , and not to meet water competition except where it is a matter of serious concern , and then only within reasonable limits . If the competition further di velops , the rail lines plan from time to time to seek relief on additional commodities . The present application covers only carload traffic , but later applications may be filed to include some that is less than carload . It was said that if the steamship lines reduce their rates , as in fact they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet the situation thus created . None of the proposed rates meet even approximately the coast-tocoast rates of the water lines . They are not generally intended or expected to draw or to hold any large amount of the port-to-port traffic to the rail lines . They did , however , at the time of the hearing , approximate the charges available from certain interior points to the Pacific-coast terminals by rail to the Atlantic and Gulf ports and hence by water , plus such incidental charges as marine insurance and unloading and transfer charges at Pacific-coast terminals . In determining the rate to be applied on each commodity the carriers generally selected the interior point or points at which the competitive traffic originates in largest volume , and from which the local rate to the Atlantic seaboard was , in their opinion , high enough when taken in connection with the port-to-port water rate and incidental charges , to constitute the basis for arriving at a reasonably compensatory all rail rate . For instance , the rate proposed from all points on iron and steel approximated the rate from Pittsburgh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maryland , rail and water , plus a few cents to represent the superiority of the rail service . It was not intended to meet the competitive situation at the North Atlantic ports , as the port-to-port water rate was so low as to make that impossible . In determining the rate on each of the commodities considered there were  | added generally a few cents to the basic figure . The rate arrived at , according to the above method , was , as a rule , proposed from all points in the defined territories to the Pacific-coast terminals . It was blanketed to apply from all points east of the rate-fixing point in order to accommodate those who , for some special or emergency reason , preferred to pay a substantially higher all-rail rate than is available in connection with the water lines . It was blanketed to apply from points west of the rate-fixing point in order to keep all parties in position to do business in competition with those who could use the water routes to advantage . Ordinarily a given commodity is produced at many points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific coast is not likely to purchase in the Middle West if he can get the same article in the East at about the same price and at a much lower freight rate . The blanketing of points of origin , it was hoped , would induce the movement of traffic from the Middle West and afford the carriers the same kind of traffic , with the same gross revenues for the shorter haul , as they would receive for the longer haul from the points farther east . In other words , the lines west of Chicago would rather move traffic from Chicago than from Pittsburgh , for they would thus avoid a division of the rate with their Eastern connections . If they should publish a higher rate from Chicago than from Pittsburgh because the rail-andocean rate from Chicago was higher than from Pittsburgh , not much of the traffic would originate at Chicago . The Eastern points would presumably do the lion 's share of the business , shipping either by the water lines or all rail , the former route depriving the Western lines of the traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail haul than if the traffic moves all rail from Chicago . In a few instances it is attempted to justify this blanketing arrangement by the fact that traffic can be shipped from Chicago , Birmingham , Alabama , and the Middle West in general , via the Gulf ports , at through rates to the Pacific coast that approximate the rates via Atlantic ports from producing points father east , such as Pittsburgh and Cincinnati , Ohio . Keeping the Middle West on a rate parity with the East is alleged to he wholesome in its economic effects , in that it tends to distribute manufacturing industry and avoid its concentration in the East . Stated otherwise , it tends to prevent the exclusive development of the country within range of the seaboard to the disadvantage of the interior . The lines west of Chicago might be inclined to provide lower rates from the Middle West than from seaboard territory , in order to develop points of origin on their own lines , but they might thus lose  | traffic from points east . Moreover , it seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamship line reaching New York City , to keep that point on a parity with the Middle West . This his tended to blanket points of origin . It may be noted that subsequent to the hearings the Southern Pacific published on a number of commodities reduced rates from its New York piers to Pacific-coast terminals , which conform to the long and short haul rule . They are now under suspension in Investigation and Suspension Docket No. 1511 , Reduced Rates from New York Piers . Five of these commodities , namely , canned goods , linoleum , coffee , paints , and cordage , are included in this application , which asks authority to establish over all routes still lower rates to the terminals only . The carriers are not disposed to blanket their rates to points of destination , and therefore make application for relief from the long and short haul rule . They state that to blanket the proposed rates to destinations might mean for them loss of net revenue greater than the profit that would be obtained from the proposed rates to the terminals . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so much opportunity for shortening the haul as there is with refer ence to points of origin . The position of the carriers seems to be that Chicago and points in that part of the country can produce all the manufactured articles that the Pacific coast and intermountain territory consume , and that the movement from the Middle West as well as from the seaboard should be encouraged because it is in the interest of the carriers , while on the other hand the intermountain ' territory can not consume , or its jobbers reasonably or economically distribute , all the traffic that now goes to the Pacific coast . In other words , the carriers seemingly feel that comparatively little could be accomplishes I in the way of shortening the haul by affording interior points such as Spokane , Reno , and Phoenix the same rates as the coast , because the capacity of these points for consumption and distribution is limited . The territory tributary to them is rather sparsely settled . Apparently , the carriers ' view is that it is not possible by freight rates materially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as distributing points ; and that no such adjustment of rates will make Spokane , Reno , and Phoenix the distributing centers for the more densely populated territory along the Pacific coast . While on traffic to the Pacific coast it is proposed to keep the Middle West on a parity with seaboard territory , the latter would be required to pay more than the Middle West on traffic to intermountain  | territory . In other words the present rates both to the terminals and to intermountain territory are graded as to territories of origin . For instance , the rates on structural steel to both regions of destination at the time of the hearing were $1.175 from Colorado common points , $1.255 from Missouri River , $1.42 from Mississippi River , $1.50 from Chicago , $1.585 from Cincinnati , $1.665 from Pittsburgh , and $1.835 from the Atlantic seaboard . This grading arrangement would be left unchanged on traffic destined to intermountain territory , although on traffic destined to the terminals , as previously explained , it is proposed to blanket the rates over the whole territory of origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afforded the intermediate points . The intermountain interests in order to draw traffic from the Atlantic seaboard must surmount an obstacle in the form of higher rates than from Chicago . To reduce the rates from the Middle West to the Pacific coast on account of the water rates from seaboard territory to the Pacific coast is in the interest of Western rail lines , but a reduction from seaboard territory to intermountain territory to meet the existing rail rates from the Middle West to intermountain territory would lengthen the haul on such traffic as moved from the seaboard region and not benefit the Western rail lines . In fact the applicants represent that if the rail lines should insist on hauling traffic from seaboard territory rather than from Chicago at an equality of rates they might lay themselves open to a charge of inefficient operation . As to intermountain territory , there is , it is alleged , no compelling reason for such a policy of rate-making ... . Where water competition is involved , the applicants contend that they demonstrate the propriety of relief from the long and short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is actual and compelling ; that the rates proposed to meet the water competition , while less than they might otherwise be , are necessary if applicants are to secure an equitable share of the traffic ; that the proposed rates yield some margin over the extra expense involved in taking on the additional traffic moving thereunder ; and that the rates maintained to intermediate points are not unreasonable in themselves . Each of these positions , they contend , is demonstrated on the present record , taken in connection with our finding in Intermediate Rate Asso. v. Director General , supra , that the rates to intermediate points are not unreason- rejudicial . This showing , they aver , brings them squarely within the rules under which we administered the fourth section prior to the amendments of 1920 . They further contend that the present wording of the fourth section , prohibiting us from granting relief where the charge to or from the more distant point is not reasonably compensatory for the service performed , does not in any wise invalidate the sufficiency of the showing which they here make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed terminal rates are all they can get , and yield something in the way of net revenue , they are perforce reasonably compensatory . This requirement of the amended fourth section that " in exercising the authority conferred upon it in this proviso the Commission shall not permit the establishment of any charge to or from the more distant point that is not reasonably compensatory for the service performed " has proved to be the crux of the issue presented as to meaning of the amended fourth section . For the intermountain interests it is argued that a rate to be reasonably compensatory to the more distant terminal point must bear its full share of operating expenses , interest on funded debt , equipment and joint facility rents , taxes , and the percentage return fixed by us pursuant to Section 15a of the Interstate Commerce Act . In support of this interpretation various court decisions are cited defining the words " reasonably compensatory , " or words that are said to be tantamount thereto . We are unable to accept this interpretation of the phrase " reasonably compensatory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fourth section must become absolute or rigid from the very nature of the case . According to this version of " reasonably compensatory , " the rate to the farther-distant point must yield its full share of the expense of utilizing the additional track mileage covered , as well as its full share of the additional expenses incident to the longer use of equipment required for the longer haul . There may be difficulty in discovering to a nicety the exact legislative intent in the amended fourth section . But the rejection of an absolute long and short haul clause by both Houses of Congress is inconsistent with any construction of the phrase in question which would be equivalent in effect to an absolute clause . A similar but less extreme interpretation of the words " reasonably compensatory " is urged on behalf of various state commissions in the intermountain territory . It is pointed out that there is a margin  | between a rate which barely escapes being confiscatory and the highest rate which a regulating body may lawfully allow . To the intermediate Point a rate might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant point might conceivably be less and yet not so low as to be confiscatory . Seemingly , the rate to the more distant point may contribute something less than a full proportionate share of return upon investment and thus theoretically be less than a greater rate to an intermediate point . This version of " reasonably compensatory " seems to agree with the former interpretation in that both require that the rate to the more distant point must pay its full share of all operating expenses , but is more elastic in not requiring that it must contribute its full share to the return designated as profit . Both interpretations appear to hold in common that a " reasonably compensatory " rate can not be less than a rate which , if imposed by a regulatory tribunal , would be adjudged nonconfiscatory . We are unable to accept this interpretation of the words " reasonably compensatory " as used in the amended fourth section . Where a rate imposed by a regulatory body is under judicial review upon the allegation that the rate fixed is confiscatory , it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fixed by such tribunal which is based alone on the out-of-pocket costs ascribable to that particular traffic , but that to be lawful the rate must be sufficient to cover it ratable proportion of the average cost of freight traffic generally , including a return on the property devoted to public service . To hold otherwise would compel the performance of a certain specified kind of service by the carrier at less than average cost . The extension of this principle to other classes of traffic , if pursued far enough , would bankrupt the road . Where , however , carriers voluntarily propose to reduce certain rates to an out-of-pocket plus basis in order to augment the total traffic carried , a wholly different situation is presented . The menace of confiscation is absent , for volenti non fit injuria ; and the additional traffic , if secured with a resulting augmentation of net revenue instead of laying a burden upon other traffic , affords the possibility of lightening the burden thereon by bringing a greater tonnage under contribution to net revenue . The criteria of a reasonably compensatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the criteria of a reasonably compensatory rate where carriers volunteer a reduction on certain rates to an out-of-pocket plus basis . In the first set of cases the carrier  | has presumably been charged with seeking to extract from the public which is served more than the services are reasonably worth ; in t I w second set of cases the carrier is accused by protestants , not primarily , of seeking to extort more than the service is reasonably worth to those " .. who receive the service but of working undue discrimination as between those who can and those who can not avail themselves of the lower rates voluntarily proposed . The criterion of a reasonably compensatory rate suggested by the carriers has been indicated above . It is summarized in the formtila " **39;230006;TOOLONG . " Just as we have rejected the two interpretations of " reasonably compensatory , " suggested by the protestants as too narrow , so we are disposed to reject the single criterion suggested by the carriers in the above formula as insufficient , standing alone . It is probably true that this formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications prior to the amendments of the fourth section in the Transportation Act , 1920 , Fourth Section Violations in the Southeast , 30 I. C. C. 153 . We do not agree with the carriers that the fourth section has not been changed in substance . The amendment has made mandatory what theretofore rested in our sound discretion as to compensation for the service performed to the more distant point , as to circuity , and as to potential water competition . Moreover , in Section 500 of the Transportation Act , 1920 , is expressly declared the policy of Congress to foster and preserve in full vigor both rail and water transportation . We think the amendment was the Congress 's way of saying that we should follow a less liberal policy in dealing with departures from the long and short haul rule than had been followed in former years . Our administrative power at this time is in some respects narrower than before the amendment . The fourth section , as amended , requires the observance by us of certain administrative rules which we were enforcing prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our sound discretion to modify or change . We are also required now to accord due observance to Section 500 of the Transport , , tion Act , 1920 , which indicates the purpose of Congress " to promote , encourage , and develop water transportation , service , and facilities in connection with the commerce of the United States , and to foster and preserve in full vigor both rail and water transportation . " Moreover , the requirements of Section 15a may not be defeated or jeopardized by the action of particular rail carriers seeking to augment their own net earnings , irrespective of the effect of rate changes  | adverse to the carriers of the country generally , or of a large territorial group . Trunk Line and Ex-Lake Iron Ore Rates , 69 I. C. C. 589 . It clearly would defeat the intent of Congress to foster transportation by rail and water in full vigor if the rail carriers were permitted , at practically little or no profit to themselves , to operate so as to deprive water carriers of traffic which the water carriers would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that where the out-ofpocket theory is used as a rate basis , there is inevitably thrown upon the rest of the traffic the task of providing the bulk of the net return contemplated in Section 15a . Too wide an extension of the out-ofpocket theory would transpose the entire burden of producing dividends and interest and meeting other fixed charges upon only a part of the traffic carried . In the light of these and similar considerations , we are of opinion and find that in the administration of the fourth section the words " reasonably compensatory " imply that a rate properly so described must ( 1 ) cover and more than cover the extra or additional expenses incurred in handling the traffic to which it applies ; ( 2 ) be no lower than necessary to meet existing competition ; ( 3 ) not be so low as to threaten the extinction of legitimate competition by water carriers ; and ( 4 ) not impose an undue burden on other traffic or jeopardize the appropriate return on the value of carrier property generally , as contemplated in Section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates of this character ought , wherever possible , to bear some relation to the value of the commodity carried and the value of the service rendered in connection therewith . We also find that where carriers apply for relief from the long and short haul clause of the fourth section and propose the application of rates which they designate as " reasonably compensatory , " they should affirmatively show that the rates proposed conform to the criteria indicated above . It goes without saying that carriers should not propose rates or rate structures for approval in a fourth-section application which create infractions of other provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act , and particularly of Section 3 . Statistical data were offered by the carriers to prove that the proposed rates to the terminals would be sufficient to pay something over and above the out-of-pocket costs . On the basis of actual operating expenses of all Class I roads in the  | United States for the year 1920 , adjusted to the present wage scale , the carriers estimate the total operating expenses for 1921 , and then take 75.22 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to freight traffic . On the basis of 1920 freight traffic statistics , taken from our preliminary abstract , they then estimate the operating expense , or transportation cost , per car-mile for revenue freight in 1921 to be 27.113 cents . They estimate the cost of moving carload freight in the United States in 1921 , per car and per 100 pounds , to have been as follows : These figures assume that it costs the same per car-mile to haul a car a long distance as it does a short distance . The average haul in 192 was 326 miles , and since the cost of moving long-haul traffic is generally less per car than that of short-haul traffic the figures shown for the distances in the above table are believed by the carriers to be very liberal . Since part of the traffic to be taken at the proposed rates is now moving by water and any business that would be drawn away from the water lines would therefore be added traffic for the rail lines , the i carriers proceed to eliminate from the above estimated costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added traffic . In other words , added traffic is regarded as not logically participating in all expenses . The determination of the cost chargeable to the added traffic is undertaken on two bases after assigning 33 per cent of the expense of maintenance of way and structures and 80 per cent of the expense of maintenance of equipment to the movement of traffic , the balance of the maintenance expenses being chargeable , according to experts , to the action of the elements . Basis I proceeds on the theory that the added traffic would all be carried on trains not now running full and would therefore not entail added train-miles , while Basis II assumes that the added traffic would require pro rata added train-miles . Under Basis I the carriers arbitrarily assign to the cost of handling the added traffic certain percentage proportions of various items of expense and compute the ratio that  | these proportions represent to the total transportation expenses . For instance , it is assumed that the expense of station employees is affected to the extent of 10 per cent by the added traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total transportation expense is 1.444 per cent . It is assumed that expenditures for train-locomotive fuel would be increased 50 per cent because of the additional loads , but nothing is charged for train enginemen , because the additional traffic , if handled in trains already moving , would not require additional train employees . The ratio that all of these items of expense bear to the total transportation expense is found to be 18.561 per cent ... . Rate Basis II proceeds along the same lines as rate Basis I , except that it includes expenses which are not included in rate Basis I. For instance , it assumes that the expense both of train-locomotive fuel and train enginemen would be increased by the added traffic to the extent of 100 per cent , and that the expense of yard conductors and brakemen would be affected by the added traffic to the extent of 50 per cent , this figure rather than 100 per cent being used on the theory that the long-haul traffic here involved requires much less switching at terminals than does traffic generally . The three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 3.483 per cent , respectively , of the total transportation expenses . All the expenses shown as assignable to the added traffic under Basis II are 64.883 per cent of the total transportation expenses . The carriers do not claim that either the figures arrived at under rate Basis I or under rate Basis II should be taken as reflecting the exact situation , but that the correct figure lies somewhere between the 18.561 per cent under Basis I and the 64.883 per cent under Basis II . It is stated that authorities on the subject regard about 50 per cent as the usual ratio for added traffic generally . Where the added traffic involves especially long hauls the ratio should be less . It is admitted by the carriers that additional train-miles will probably be necessary In some instances , but they claim that they will not have to add trainmiles in the exact ratio to added traffic .. In this connection there is some testimony from intermountain witnesses to the effect that it is the practice of carriers generally not to run trains without full load ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic to fill them . If this testimony be accepted as correct , it excludes Basis I from consideration . The carriers contend , however , that the proposed rates are still safely within costs , and that this is indicated by the final figures arrived at under Basis II .  | The percentages arrived at under Bases I and II are each used to determine the proportion of the total operating expenses of all Class I roads for 1920 which could be chargeable to the added traffic . Based on statistics as to car-loading and tare weights the costs per car and per 100 pounds for handling the additional traffic are computed for the four distances above shown , ( a ) assuming a 25 per cent empty haul for cars of the kind necessary for this business , which percentage , they say , has been found through experience to be about correct ; and ( b ) assuming no empty haul . These computations are made under both Bases I and II ; that is , both on the theory that the added traffic would require additional train-miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures are for the average car ; they are then used to determine the costs for carloads of different weights , namely , 40,000 , 50,000 , 60,000 , and 80,000 pounds ... . As above indicated , these figures are based on 1920 returns , adjusted to 1921 . A study was made by the carriers of the actual expenses during the first six months of 1921 and also for July , 1921 , with but slightly different results . The highest cost figures obtained are in almost every instance considerably below the earnings that would accrue from the proposed rates . Incidentally attention is called to the fact that the costs per car arrived at are much greater for a heavy carload than for a light carload , although it is usually contended that the costs of transporting a heavy carload do not greatly exceed the costs of transporting a light carload . It will be seen , for instance , that for a 3300-mile haul t he cost under Basis I , assuming the 25 per cent empty movement , would be $264.32 on a 40,000-pound carload , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are not prepared to accept this quantitative difference in costs . While the heavier load will entail somewhat heavier costs , we are not convinced that the variation in costs is as great as indicated in the carriers ' showing above . When it is recalled that the revenue per car is the product of the load multiplied by the rate per 100 pounds , it will he readily seen that a 20,000-pound load will yield only cnn quarter of the revenue yielded by an 80,000-pound load where the rate per 100 pounds is the same . Even where the rate on the lighter load is double that on the heavier , the revenue yield of the lightloading car is but half of the heavier loaded car , whereas in the example cited the cost of the heavier car would be only about 40 per cent greater .  | If we accept provisionally the carriers ' estimate that the average cost per car for a 3000-mile haul is $813.38 and the assumption that for added carloads of traffic the cost would be approximately half as much per car , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield per car for a haul of 3000 miles that falls appreciably short of $400 , no matter how light the carload minimum , can yield much , if anything , over out-of-pocket cost . In studying the minima in connection with the proposed blanketed rate to Pacific terminals , we can not fail to pay close attention to the minimum as well as to the rate . Thus on iron and steel articles , with minima frequently as high as 80,000 pounds , the typical earnings from Pittsburgh to the Pacific would be over $800 . We are not prepared to say that this will not cover the extra costs involved in taking on extra traffic of this kind . In some cases the proposed rate on iron and steel articles is as high as $1.40 , as , for instance , on stovepipe iron ( item 73 ) . Where different minima are proposed , the rates vary in accordance generally with the minima . In few cases is the rate on steel and iron less than 90 cents . On pianos , to take an extreme example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 14,000 pounds , although the rate is $3 . This would yield a minimum car revenue of $520 for a haul to the Pacific coast of perhaps 2500 miles , approximately . If the proposed rates were considered in and of themselves , it would be difficult to find that the revenue they return per car would not be reasonably compensatory when per-car revenue under the proposed rates is compared with per-car revenue on both domestic and export traffic under the rates in effect subsequent to July 1 , 1922 . For example , from New York to Pacific-coast ports for export the rate on structural iron and steel , in carloads , with a minimum of 80,000 pounds , is 72 cents . This implies a minimum yield of $576 per car . Similarly , from Chicago on the same articles to Pacific-coast ports for export , the rate is 50 cents , which implies a minimum revenue per car of $400 . Other rates , such as those on lumber and sash from the Pacific coast to Eastern destinations , might be cited for comparative purposes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire list of articles embraced in the general west-bound application . So far as revenue is concerned we are satisfied that , taking the additional business by itself , the proposed rates generally and easily cover the extra out-of-pocket expenses involved . In certain instances the rates proposed ? as , for example , on articles such as sewing machines , drugs , medicines , chemicals , chewing gum , rubber tires , carpets , and  | leather ? apparently would cover not only the extra costs but the average of all costs and would contribute to the net return on carrier property . Were the rate level alone to be considered , it would be difficult to condemn the proposed terminal rates in the general westbound application . Moreover , the going water rates shown upon these articles , item by item , are ? or at least at the time of the hearing were ? such as not seriously to invalidate the proposed terminal rates is lower than presumably necessary to meet water competition ... . It seems clear that the lines east of Chicago have little if any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed rates . The probabilities are that they would suffer substantial losses ... . We are not prepared to say that we could base upon the foregoing estimates of collateral losses of net revenue a necessary denial of t he applications . But we are of opinion that before we grant the affirmative relief asked , we are entitled to be shown by the carriers the probable extent of such collateral losses of net revenue , if any , and the way in which such losses would be divided as between various carriers and territorial groups . If the carriers are of opinion that no collateral loss in net revenue would result , the obligation to make such showing is upon the carriers . Should they concede the probability of a net loss in revenue to the carriers as a whole , we should have to consider whether such a shrinkage would adversely affect the return at which we are required to aim under Section 15a ; and if , reasonably assured on th point , we are prepared to allow the carriers to assume voluntarily a shrinkage in their net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to focus the whole gain resulting to the shipping public upon those shippers mainly located in a particular section or sections , or whether the relief might not more appropriately be applied throughout a wider extent of territory and among a greater number of shippers , We find that the carriers have failed to make the necessary affirmative showing as to the collateral losses of revenue which would result front the proposed terminal rates . There is another aspect of this general west-bound application which requires careful scrutiny . This is the way in which the rate structures resulting from its approval would comport with other sections of the act , particularly Section 3 . It is strongly contended that the resulting rate structure would unduly and unlawfully prejudice the Atlantic seaboard region , and would unduly and unlawfully prefer large sections of the central region from Pittsburgh to beyond the Missouri River , in respect of their traffic to  | the intermountain country and to the Pacific coast , respectively . The same rate structure , it is averred , would unduly and unlawfully prefer the Pacific terminals , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respective roles as customers or purchasers in markets east of the Colorado common points . The carriers are not expecting , by reason of the low terminal rates , to meet in any large measure water competition from points on the Atlantic or the Gulf . They are interested primarily in securing certain traffic which originates inland , such as iron and steel at Pittsburgh , which now moves largely by rail to Baltimore and thence by water to the Pacific . Accordingly the carriers name an all-rail rate from Pittsburgh to the Pacific slightly in excess of the going rail-and-water rates , rail to Baltimore and water thence to the Pacific . If they did no more than this , and did it on a similar basis for each inland iron and steel producing group , they might well be within their rights and within the law , provided the rates conformed to the other criteria named herein . But having thus fixed a rate from Pittsburgh to the Pacific , they proceed to blanket this rate from all points of origin from the Atlantic to the Missouri River or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to keep in effect rates from all Eastern origins in the same territory to intermountain destinations graded roughly according to the respective lengths of the hauls . For example , Pittsburgh is accorded a rate of $1 on item No. 10 , iron and steel , to Pacific terminals because Pittsburgh can move the freight to Baltimore for 35 cents , and thence by water for approximately 60 cents or less . Pittsburgh , in other words , is given ? perhaps appropriately given ? a $1 rate , in place of its present $1.665 rate because of its advantage of location in respect of the Atlantic seaboard . But the same reason can not justly be given for applying this same rate to iron and steel originating , let us say , at Chicago or the Missouri River . The all-rail rate , Chicago to Baltimore , is 60 cents , thence by water to the Pacific , 60 cents or less , making a through rail-and-water rate of $1.20 measure approximately Chicago 's relative advantage of location via rail and the Atlantic seaboard . Wholly with the avowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River to the Pacific , the region west of Pittsburgh is accorded a preferential rate structure , which is based on " market competition . " But if Pittsburgh and Chicago and Omaha will ship to Reno or Spokane , Pittsburgh is still to be compelled to pay a higher rate than Chicago , and Chicago a higher rate than Omaha  | and thus the more distant points suffer the disability of the longer hauls required . The route , rail and water , is available to Pittsburgh at 35 cents ( rail plus 60 cents ( water ) , a total of 95 cents . If , therefore , iron and steel are to move from Pittsburgh , all rail , west to the Pacific , it must have a rate not much over 95 cents . Chicago , however , if it moves its iron and steel via Baltimore , must pay 60 cents ( rail ) plus 60 cents ( water ) , or $1.20 . Whether Chicago moves its iron and steel all rail , or rail and water via the Atlantic , Pittsburgh has available a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore is at a distance disadvantage , from the Pacific , of 600 miles , or in this case , of 20 cents per 100 pounds . The carriers seek to justify this proposed rate structure on the ground that otherwise manufacturing will tend to be further concentrated on the congested Atlantic seaboard . They represent that their proposed rate structure will beneficially distribute manufacturing throughout the Middle West and Central West . But this they may not do , unless it can be done without creating undue rate preferences . Sloss-Sheffield Steel &; Iron Co. v. L. &; N. R. R. Co. , 46 I. C. C. 558 , 562 , 563 . The fact is well urged by the intermountain interests that the proposal to blanket all-rail rates from the Atlantic seaboard to the Missouri River , or even to the Colorado common points , will enable Pacific-coast purchasers to buy in any market in this vast domain under an equality of freight rates , and thus to profit by the widest competition . The intermountain country will continue under the handicap that in purchasing in the same region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in Chicago and more on articles purchased in Chicago than in Kansas City . In other words , their markets are restricted , whereas the Pacific-slope purchasers may disregard distance in their choice of an Eastern market . We find that the general west-bound application of these transcontinental carriers for authority to depart from the long and short haul provision of the fourth section of the Interstate Commerce Act on this record should be denied  | CAMPBELL , Commissioner : By schedules filed to become effective May 20 , 1926 , the carriers forming the circuitous routes from points in the Scranton and Williamsport , Pennsylvania , groups to Central and Western trunk-line territories proposed to increase their class and commodity rates from points in these groups to points in the destination territories to the basis of the rates in effect from higher-rated intermediate groups . Upon protest of numerous shippers and shipping associations located in the origin groups , the operation of the schedules was suspended until September 17 , 1926 . There was also set for hearing in connection with tins case fourth-section application No. 12846 , whereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commodity rates from points in the Scranton and Williamsport groups to points in central and western trunk-line territories without observance of the long and short haul provision of the Interstate Commerce Act . At the hearing the respondents offered no testimony in justification of the proposed increased rates , but devoted all of their evidence to justifying the present group adjustment and to the maintenance by the carriers forming the circuitous routes of rates at intermediate points which contravene the long and short haul provision of the fourth section . Accordingly , this report will be confined to a consideration of the evidence submitted in support of the fourth-section application . Rates are stated in cents per 100 pounds . The Scranton group lies west of the New York group and north of the Philadelphia group . The Williamsport group lies west of the Scranton group and north of the Baltimore group . The Scranton and Williamsport groups were established in 1911 at the instance of shippers located at points in these groups ; formerly they were a part of the New York and Philadelphia groups , respectively . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these groups and which the carriers had heretofore thought protected , arise in connection with the movement of traffic over lines comprising the circuitous routes . Thus , taking Scranton as a representative origin  | point and Chicago , Illinois , as a representative destination point , the direct route is by way of the Delaware , Lackawanna &; Western to Black Rock , New York , and the Wabash beyond , a distance of 7 ( i8 miles . Over this route there are no fourth-section departures . However , should a shipment be delivered to the Central Railroad of New Jersey or the Delaware &; Hudson or the New York , Ontario &; Western at Scranton fourth-section departures will occur by reason of the fact that the routes formed by these carriers and their connections pass through groups taking higher rates . The following table , taken from applicants ' exhibits , shows the direct route of the Lackawanna in connection with the Wabash and various departure routes formed by the Central Railroad of New Jersey and its connections from Scranton to Chicago , the distances over these routes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago , the sixthclass rates from these points , together with the ton-mile , car , and carmile earnings hereon , based on a minimum carload of 36,000 pounds :  | from points of origin in the two groups named to points in the destination territories ... . Numerous shippers and shippers ' organizations located in the lowerrated groups appeared in support of the fourth-section relief . The testimony of these witnesses indicates that it is highly desirable to have all available routes open , and while denial of fourth-section relief to the carriers forming the indirect routes might not be unduly burdensome during ordinary transportation conditions , it would cause delay in times of car shortage and embargoes by the direct routes . These witnesses were unanimous in their opinion that a denial of the relief sought would result in loss of business to shippers in the Scranton and Williamsport groups , and that granting of the relief would be in the public interest . No one appeared at the hearing in behalf of shippers located at any of the higher-rated intermediate points . The applicant carriers ask for relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such request attempt to differentiate the basis of the application from that of circuity of routes . In answer to a direct question as to whether the basis of the application is circuity of routes rather than market competition their witness stated that it is not a matter of market competition but is a matter of circuitous routes and indirect lines passing through higher-rated territory . The law is plain that regardless of the basis upon which relief is granted we must not permit the establishment of a rate to a more distant point that is not reasonably compensatory for the service performed . In a territory such as that here considered , where the rates in general via the direct hauls have been passed upon by us and where there is such a maze of possible routes , making it practically impossible to check and enumerate each route available in published tariffs , we must place some general limitations upon the relief granted , so that rates via direct routes will not be less than reasonably compensatory when applied via the circuitous hauls . The evidence is clear that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking relief to meet the rates of direct lines and routes between competitive points , although passing through higher-rated territory or groups , and any relief granted will also be made subject to the limitation prescribed in the equidistant provision of the fourth section . We find that respondents have not justified the proposed increased schedules . An order directing their cancellation and discontinuing the suspension proceeding will be entered . The carriers parties to the fourth-section application here considered  | will be granted authority to meet via their circuitous lines or routes the class and commodity rates contemporaneously maintained via the direct lines or routes from points in the Scranton and Williamsport groups to points in central and western trunk-line territories and to maintain higher rates at intermediate points , provided that the authority herein granted shall not include intermediate points as to which the haul of the petitioning line or route is not longer than that of the direct line or route from and to the competitive points , and provided further , that the present rates at the said intermediate points shall not be increased except as may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case exceed the lowest combination ; and provided further , that the relief herein granted shall not apply 1 . Where the short line or route is 150 miles or less in length and the longer line or route is more than 70 per cent circuitous . 2 . Where the direct line or route exceeds 150 miles but does not exceed 1000 miles in length and the longer line or route is more than 50 per cent circuitous , except that in instances where the short line or route exceeds 150 miles and the longer line or route does not exceed 255 miles relief will apply to such longer line or route even though the said longer line or route is more than 50 per cent circuitous . 3 . Where the direct line or route exceeds 1000 miles in length and the longer line or route is more than 333 per cent circuitous , except that in instances where the short line or route exceeds 1000 miles and the longer line or route does not exceed 1500 miles in length , relief will apply to such longer line or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 333 per cent circuitous . An appropriate order will be entered . WOODLOCK , Commissioner , concurring : Relief under the fourth section is justifiable only upon the theory that the traffic concerned partakes of the nature of a by-product . As a by product , and only as a by-product , does such traffic qualify itself for this relief under Sections 1 and 3 of the act . In my opinion the traffic hen concerned is of that nature , and is entitled to relief . To that extent I con cur in the report . I do not , however , agree that on the facts there is war rant for limiting the circuity under such relief to the extent prescribed in the report . There is no reason for supposing that , for instance , on route No. 3 as shown in the report 11 cents per car-mile is not fully compensatory on by-product traffic between Scranton and Chicago . I see no reason for departing from our not unusual practice of permitting up to 70 per cent circuity on all the routes here concerned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( already discussed in this section under G ) applies , as has been seen , to rates .

Upon complaint from the freight bureau of the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce and from the freight bureau of Chicago that the rates charged on different classes of freight by defendant railroads between Chicago and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reasonable , the Interstate Commerce Commission conducted an investigation and hearing . It found that the rates in question were  | unreasonable and unjust , and ordered the carriers to cease and desist from charging , after July 10 , 1894 , more than certain rates set forth in a schedule prescribed by the Commission . The railroads failed to comply , and the Interstate Commerce Commission instituted a suit in a Federal court asking for a mandamus to compel obedience to its order . The circuit court of appeals submitted the following question to the Supreme Court for an opinion : Had the Interstate Commerce Commission jurisdictional power to make the order hereinbefore set forth ? all proceedings preceding said order being due and regular , so far as procedure is concerned ? " MR . JusTICE BREWER delivered the opinion of the court : ... Before the passage of the act it was generally believed that there were great abuses in railroad management and railroad transportation , and the grave question which Congress had to consider was how those abuses should be corrected and what control should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry is limited to the question as to what it determined should be done with reference to the matter of rates . There were three obvious and dissimilar courses open for consideration . Congress might itself prescribe the rates ; or it might commit to some subordinate tribunal this duty ; or it might leave with the companies the right to fix rates , subject to regulations and restrictions , as well as to that rule which is as old as the existence of common carriers , to wit , that rates must be reasonable . There is nothing in the act fixing rates . Congress did not attempt to exercise that power , and if we examine the legislative and public history of the day it is apparent that there was no serious thought of doing so . The question debated is whether it vested in the Commission the lower and the duty to fix rates ; and the fact that this is a debatable question , and has been most strenuously and earnestly debated , is very persuasive that it did not . The grant of such a power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so vast and comprehensive , so largely affecting the rights of carrier and shipper , as well as indirectly all commercial transactions , the language by which the power is given had been so often used and was so familiar to the legislative mind and , is capable of such definite and exact statement , that no just rule of construction would tolerate a grant of such power by mere implication . Administrative control over railroads through boards or commissions was no new thing . It had been resorted to in England and in many of the states of this Union . In England while control had been  | given in respect to discrimination and undue preferences , no power had been given to prescribe a tariff of rates . In this country the prac tice had been varying . It will be interesting to notice the provisions in the legislation of different states . We quote the exact language f ollowing some of the quotations with citations of cases in which the statute has been construed : The quotations from state statutes are omitted . .. : The legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Report of the Interstate Commerce Commission , Appendix E , pages 243 and following . It is true that some of these statutes were passed after the Interstate Commerce Act , but most were before , and they all show what phraseology has been deemed necessary whenever the intent has been to give to the commissioners the legislative power of fixing rates . It is one thing to inquire whether the rates which have been charged and collected are reasonable , ? that is a judicial act ; but an entirely different thing to prescribe rates which shall be charged in the future ,  - -  that is a legislative act ... . It will be perceived that in this case the Interstate Commerce Commission assumed the right to prescribe rates which should control in the future , and their application to the court was for a mandamus to compel the companies to comply with their decision ; that is , to abide by their legislative determination as to the maximum rates to be observed in the future . Now , nowhere in the Interstate Commerce Act do we find words similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission power to " increase or reduce any of the rates " ; " to establish rates of charges " ; " to make and fix reasonable and just rates of freight and passenger tariffs " ; " to make a schedule of reasonable maximum rates of charges " ; " to fix tables of maximum charges " ; to compel the carrier " to adopt such rate , charge , or classification as said commissioners shall declare to be equitable and reasonable . " The power , therefore , is not expressly given . Whence then is it deduced ? In the first section it is provided that " all charges . . . shall be reasonable and just ; and every unjust and unreasonable charge for such service is prohibited and declared to be unlawful . " Then follow sections prohibiting discrimination , undue preferences , higher charges for a short than for a long haul , and pooling , and also making provision for the preparation by the companies of schedules of rates , and requiring their publication . Section 11 creates the Inter- state Commerce Commission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 Stat. at L. 858 ) , gives it authority to inquire into the management of the business of all common carriers , to demand full and complete information from them , and adds , " and the Commission is hereby authorized to execute and enforce the provisions of this act . " And the argument is that in enforcing and executing the provisions of the act it is to execute and enforce the law as stated in the first section , which is that all charges snall be reasonable and just , and that every unjust and unreasonable charge is prohibited ; that it can not enforce this mandate of the law without a determination of what are reasonable and just charges ; and as no other tribunal is created for such determination , therefore it must be implied that it is authorized to make the determination , and , having made it , apply to the courts for a mandamus to compel the enforcement of such determination . In other words , that though Congress has not in terms given the Commission the power to determine what are just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other tribunal has been provided , it must have intended that the Commission should exercise the power . We do not think this argument can be sustained . If there were nothing else in the act than the first section commanding reasonable rates , and the twelfth empowering the Commission to execute and enforce the provisions of the act , we should be of the opinion that Congress did not intend to give to the Commission the power to prescribe any tariff and determine what for t he future should be reasonable and just rates . The power given is the power to execute and enforce , not to legislate . The power given is partly judicial , partly executive and administrative , but not legislative . Pertinent in this respect are these observations of counsel for the appellees : Article 2 , Section 3 , of the Constitution of the United States , ordains that the President " shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed . " The Act to Regulate Commerce is one of those laws . But it will not be argued that the Iresident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriers engaged in interstate commerce ... . The 1st section simply enacted the common-law requirement that all charges shall be reasonable and just . For more than a hundred years it has been the affirmative duty of the courts " to execute and enforce " the commonlaw requirement that " all charges shall be reasonable and just " ; and yet it ins never been claimed that the courts , by implication , possessed the power to make rates for carriers . But the power of fixing rates under the Interstate Commerce Act is not to be determined by any mere considerations of omission or  | implication . The act contemplates the fixing of rates and recognizes the authority in which the power exists . The court quotes Section 6 of the Interstate Commerce Act . ... Now , but for this act , it would be unquestioned that the carrier had the right to prescribe its tariff of rates and charges , subject to the limitation that such rates and charges should be reasonable . This Section 6 recognizes that right , and provides for its continuance . I t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common carrier " has established and which are in force . " It does not say that the schedules thus prepared , and which are to be submitted to the Commission , are subject , in any way , to the latter 's approval . Filing with the Commission and publication by posting in the various stations are all that is required , and are the only limitations placed on the carrier in respect to the fixing of its tariff . Not only is it thus plainly stated that the rates are those which the carrier shall establish , but the prohibitions upon change are limited in the case of an advance by ten days ' public notice , and on reduction by three days . Nothing is said about the concurrence or approval of the Commission , but they are to be made at the will of the carrier . Not only are there these provisions in reference to the tariff upon its own line ; but further when two carriers shall unite in a joint tariff ( and such union is nowhere made obligatory , but is simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariff shall be filed with the Commission , and nothing but the kind and extent of publication thereof is left to the discretion of the Commission . It will be perceived that the section contemplates a change in rates either by increase or reduction , and provides the conditions therefor ; but of what significance is the grant of this privilege to the carrier if the future rate has been prescribed by an order of the Commission , and compliance with that order enforced by a judgment of the court in mandamus ? The very idea of an order prescribing rates for the future , and a judgment of the court directing compliance with that order , is one of permanence . Could anything be more absurd than to ask a judgment of the court in mandamus proceedings that the defendant comply with a certain order unless it elects not to do so ? The fact that the carrier is given the power to establish in the first instance , and the right to change , and the conditions of such change specified , is irresistible evidence that this action on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent upon the judgment of the Commission .  | We have , therefore , these considerations presented : First . The power to prescribe a tariff of rates for carriage by a common carrier is a legislative and not an administrative or judicial function , and , having respect to the large amount of property invested in railroads , the various companies engaged therein , the thousands of miles of road , and the millions of tons of freight carried , the varying and diverse conditions attaching to such carriage , is a power of supreme delicacy and importance . Second . That Congress has transferred such a power to any administrative body is not to be presumed or implied from any doubtful and uncertain language . The words and phrases efficacious to make such a delegation of power are well understood and have been frequently used , and if Congress had intended to grant such a power to the Interstate Commerce Commission it can not be doubted that it would have used language open to no misconstruction , but clear and direct . Third . Incorporating into a statute the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges reasonable and just , and directing the Commission to execute and enforce the provisions of the act , does not by implication carry to the Commission or invest it with the power to exercise the legislative function of prescribing rates which shall control in the future . Fourth . Beyond the inference which irresistibly follows from the omission to grant in express terms to the Commission this power of fixing rates , is the clear language of Section 6 , recognizing the right of the carrier to establish rates , to increase or reduce them , and prescribing the conditions upon which such increase or reduction may be made , and requiring , as the only conditions of its action , first , publication , and , second , the filing of the tariff with the Commission . The grant to the Commission of the power to prescribe the form of the schedules , and to direct the place and manner of publication of joint rates , thus specifying the scope and limit of its functions in this respect , strengthens the conclusion that the power to prescribe rates or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers granted to the Commission . These considerations convince us that under the Interstate Commerce Act the Commission has no power to prescribe the tariff of rates which shall control in the future , and , therefore , can not invoke a judgment in mandamus from the courts to enforce any such tariff by it prescribed . But has the Commission no functions to perform in respect to the matter of rates ; no power to make any inquiry in respect thereto ? Unquestionably it has , and most important duties in respect to this  | matter . It is charged with the general duty of inquiring as to the management of the business of railroad companies , and to keep itself informed as to the manner in which the same is conducted , and has the right to compel complete and full information as to the manner in which such carriers are transacting their business . And with this knowledge it is charged with the duty of seeing that there is no viola tion of the long and short haul clause ; that there is no discrimination between individual shippers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other device to give preference to one as against another ; that no undue preferences are given to one place or places or individual or class of individuals , but that in all things that equality of right , which is the great purpose of the Interstate Commerce Act , shall be secured to all shippers . It must also see that that publicity , which is required by Section 6 , is observed by the railroad companies . Holding the rail road companies to strict compliance with all these statutory provisions and enforcing obedience to all these provisions tends , as observed by Commissioner Cooley in Re Chicago , St. P. &; K. C. R. Co. , 2 I. C. C. Rep. 231 , 261 , to both reasonableness and equality of rate as contemplated by the Interstate Commerce Act ... . Our conclusion , then , is that Congress has not conferred upon the Commission the legislative power of prescribing rates either maximum or minimum or absolute . As it did not give the express power to the Commission it did not intend to secure the same result indirectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past was reasonable and just , whether as maximum , minimum , or absolute , and then enable it to obtain from the courts a peremptory order that in the future the railroad company should follow the rates thus deter mined to have been in the past reasonable and just . The question certified must be answered in the negative , and it is so ordered . Mr. JUSTICE . HARLAN dissented.  | The Illinois Central Railroad advanced the rate on pine lumber from the Gulf states to points on the Ohio River two cents per hundred pounds . The Central Yellow Pine Association complained to the Interstate Commerce Commission ; and the latter , after a hearing , found the increase not reasonable and ordered the railroad to desist from enforcing it . The railroad refused to obey , and the Commission asked for a mandamus , which was granted in the circuit court . The railroad appealed . MR . JUSTICE MCKENNA delivered the opinion of the court : Counsel for appellants in his oral argument made the declaration that it would not be necessary for this court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and says in his supplemental brief : I do not insist that this court shall read the voluminous testimony contained in these records , but I do most respectfully ask it to lay down the rules or principles of transportation law which are fairly involved in the just determination of these cases , and to remand them to the Commission , to be reexamined upon the testimony in conformity with the principles of transportation law to be announced by this court . To what , then , shall we resort ? How shall we determine what " principles of transportation law " were involved ? How determine  | whether they were recognized and applied , or denied and rejected , by the Commission , and , necessarily , by the circuit court ? An examination of the testimony , by concession of counsel , is out of the question . And the findings of the Commission are made by law prima facie true . This court has ascribed to them the strength due to the judgments of a tribunal appointed by law and informed by experience . Louisville &; N. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee , V. &; G. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission , 181 U.S. 1 . And , in any special case of conflicting evidence , a probative force must be attributed to the findings of the Commission , which , in addition to " knowledge of conditions , of environment , and of transportation relations , " has had the witnesses before it and has been able to judge of them and their manner of testifying . In the case at bar these considerations are reenforced by a concurrent judgment of the circuit court . The question is one of the reasonableness of a rate , and such a question was said to be one of fact in Texas &; P. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission , 162 U.S. 197 ; Cincinnati , N. O. &; T. P. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission , 162 U.S. 184 . In these cases , however , it was declared that the conclusions of the Commission are subject to review if it excluded " facts and circumstances that ought to have been considered . " Upon this declaration appellants rely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles of transportation which , they contend , the Commission disregarded ; and appellants venture the observation that unless this 1w done " there will be no settled principles of law for the guidance of either the Commission or of the courts , " and that " the interstate railroad companies will be the only persons in this country who will not be able to obtain the opinion of the courts upon questions of law which vitally affect their interest . " We think the apprehension is groundless and is demonstrated to be groundless by the cases cited . In all of them legal propositions were reviewed as elements in the inquiry of the reasonableness of a rate . Those cases , however , are in marked contrast to the pending case . It will be observed that in them the instances were very simple . There was a salient circumstance in each of them about which there was no uncertainty . In other words , it was unconfused by dispute and was not put to question by a conflict of testimony . A definite legal proposition unmixed with fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Commission was to reject it . . . . In all these cases , therefore , there was a single , distinct , and domi- nant proposition of law which the Commission had rejected , and the exact influence of which , in its decisions , could be estimated . Indeed , they were mere constructions of the statute , the delegation of the Commission 's duties and power ... . The concession of counsel with which we have commenced this opinion is a frank recognition of the effect which this court has given t o the decisions of the Interstate Commerce Commission on questions of fact . And we have said very recently : " The statute gives prima facie effect to the findings of the Commission , and , when those findings are concurred in by the circuit court , we think they should not be interfered with unless the record establishes that clear and unmistakable error has been committed . " Cincinnati , H. &; D. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission , 206 U.S. 142 ... . The questions submitted to the Commission , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one which turned on matters of fact . In that question , of course , there were elements of law , but we can not see that any one of these or any circumstances probative of the conclusion was overlooked or disregarded . The testimony was voluminous . It is not denied that it was conflicting , and , by concession of counsel , it included a large amount of testimony taken on behalf of appellants in support of the propositions contended for by them . Whether the Commission gave too much weight to some parts of it and too little weight to other parts of it is a question of fact , and not of law . It seems from the findings , report , and conclusions of the Commission that it considered every circumstance pertinent to the problem before it . Further testimony was taken by the circuit court and its judgment confirmed that of the Commission and approved its order . Decree affirmed . MR . JUSTICE MOODY took no part in the decision of this case . MR . JUSTICE BREWER dissented.  | The statement so frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult one , means no more than that there is no definite scientific rule by which it can , with certainty , be determined just what is a reasonable rate . The " tribunal appointed by law and informed by experience " has evolved and is evolving principles which will furnish sufficient data to justify generalizations broad enough to authorize the deduction of scientific principles . In making these deductions , the first consideration is the agency which performs the service . This agency performs a public service , devotes its property to a public use and must , therefore , submit to public regulation ; but the capital of this agency is private capital entitled to protection as such . To these facts the law applied the principle that those who furnish such private capital so devoted to a public use are entitled to receive a fair return from such investment . What is a " fair return " involves economic considerations such as the risks involved in the investment , the security of the investment because it is a practical monopoly , returns which capital may secure from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be devoted to this special use . " Fair return " necessarily involves the question of the value of the property so devoted to the public use . In determining this value there must be considered the  | investment , that made originally and that added in permanent improvements , the present market value of the stocks and bonds , which are but symbols of the investment , the question of the cost of the property , its reproduction cost and the methods of making the investment , that is , was the investment made wisely and honestly or otherwise . The character of the territory served by the carrier is not infrequently a fact which must not be lost sight of . The extent and regularity of the whole movement is determined by the character of the inhabitants and the kinds of business conducted by them . The physical situation of the agency as to grades , curves , etc. , may materially affect the cost of the service and thereby determine the amount of the return which should be received . The attitude of the agency to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been solved by the agency in a long course of dealing would indicate that such agency has found a solution not unfair to itself . The thing transported must be considered . Is it heavy as compared with the space it occupies ? Does it require any special equipment ? Is it subject to loss or injury in transporting ? Is there much or little of it ? The answers to these questions furnish facts which must be considered in classifying commodities so as to fix rates or charges for their transportation . The places from and to which the commodities move are factors in the problem . The distance a thing is hauled must be considered , as the greater the distance the less ordinarily is the cost for each mile of the haul , and the service of loading and unloading applies the same to a short as to a long haul . The situation of the man who owns the thing moved and the purpose of the movement frequently affects the question of the rate . This does not mean that rates must be determined by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a producer of a commodity which is also produced by others in the same general territory , the market for all the producers being the same , can not ship otherwise than upon rates not greatly higher than his competitors . This principle is similar to the one that justifies a rate basis made to meet market competition . A thing may grow or be mined in widely different localities , and the sale of the thing may be in the same market . Obviously that this market may have the benefit of competition and that producing localities may have the benefit of a market , distance can not be made an absolute measure for the rates .  | So the public interest must not be disregarded in determining what this public agency shall receive for performing the duties which societ y has farmed out to it . Rates must not be so adjusted as to deprive the public of the service , commodities must be moved and they can not be moved if the charge therefor exceeds the value to be derived from the movement . One producer must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That charges may not exceed the value of the sere - ice is an economic law depending upon neither court nor commission for its enforcement . Carriers may with propriety and for the good of the general public make rates barely more than the cost of the particular movement , iii order to develop industries , create and maintain competition and serve those who because of their location distant from the point of production can not be otherwise served . Rate-making tribunals may not make rates so low as to deprive private capital of a substantial return on the fair value of the property devoted to the public use . While long existing wrongs do not become rights and no one can have a vested interest in a wrong , the fact that in the slow evolution toward a science of rate-making there have grown up rate situations inconsistent with the principles which must exist when there is such a science , does not justify an abrupt and radical alteration of these situations . Existing conditions are facts which must be recognized in the application of all abstract economic principles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may be inapplicable to the particular situation . To determine what is a reasonable rate , the law must be applied , economics considered and ethics invoked , and while the facts to be weighed are multitudinous and the scientific principles few , we may say that it is not fanciful to anticipate that a system of rate-making will be evolved which will approach justice . Shippers and carriers contending each with the other , sometimes selfishly , but not infrequently with an earnest desire for a right solution , presenting their theories to a disinterested and unbiased tribunal , " appointed by law and informed by experience , " may furnish data which , being sifted , studied and classified in its reports , will enable that tribunal to solve the problem . A more detailed consideration of many of the points mentioned above will be found in J , infra , " Economic Bases of Rate Fixing . "  | 3 .

Is this valid under the Interstate Commerce Act ? The pertinent statutory provisions are found in the Interstate Commerce Act , Section 6 , paragraphs 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ( first part ) , 9 1 " ( I. C. Act , pp. 22-26 ) . The requirement that schedules of rates should be printed and kept for public inspection was a part of the act . of 1887 , but it was enlarged and completely rewritten in 1906 . Sections 9-12 were added in 1910 , and certain formal changes were made by the Transportation Act of 1920.  | The pertinent statutory provisions are found in the Interstate Commerce Act , Section 6 , paragraph 7 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proviso only ) and paragraphs 2 and 3 , and in the Elkins Act , Section 1 ( the second sentence in the first paragraph and all the second paragraph ) ( I. C. Act , pp. 24-25 , 30-31 , 88-89 ) . The act of 1887 forbade any departure from the published rates , but the present form of the last part of paragraph 7 in Section 6 dates from 1906 . The portions of Section 10 referred to were added to the act in 1889 ; but the words " or the transmission of intelligence " were placed in the proviso by the Transportation Act of 1920 . Paragraph 3 was considerably amplified in 1910 ; to facilitate comparison it is printed below as it appeared before the amendment of 1910 . The words " or shipper " in the second paragraph of Section 1 of the Elkins Act were inserted in 1906 . It should be remembered that departure from the lawful rates is a form of discrimination and consequently is subject to the penalties for die ? crimination already cited under IV , G , 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elkins Act given in that section . Reference should also be made to Section 16 , paragraphs 8-10 , of the Interstate Commerce Act ( see IV , E , 2 ) and to Section 23 ( see IV , E , 3 ) . SECTION 10. ( 3 ) Before the amendment of 1910 . Any person , and any officer or agent of any corporation or company who shall deliver  | property for transportation to any common carrier subject to the provisions of this act , or for whom , as consignor or consignee , any such carrier shall transport property , who shall knowingly and willfully , by false billing , false classification , false weighing , false representation of the contents of the package , false report of weight , or by any other device or means , whether with or without the consent or connivance of the carrier , its agent , or agents , obtain transportation for such property at less than the regular rates then established and in force on the line of transportation ; shall be deemed guilty of fraud , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon conviction thereof in any court of the United States of competent jurisdiction within the district in which such offense was committed , be subject for each offense to a fine of not exceeding five thousand dollars or imprisonment in the penitentiary for a term of not exceeding two years , or both , in the discretion of the court .  | We recommend that each of the four subdivisions of Section 10 of the Interstate Commerce Act be amended by providing therein a minimum fine of not less than $500 for each offense . That section carries a maximum penalty of $5000 but no minimum ... . The purpose of the section , and especially subdivisions ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , and ( 4 ) , obviously is to maintain the integrity of published tariff rates , and to prevent and punish unjust discrimination and favors granted or received by means of false billing , false weights , claims , or other device . Experience shows that this section is violated by shippers more frequently than any other section of the act . Such violations are profitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by defeating the applicable rates , but also because of the advantage thus obtained by the violator over his competitor . The railroads themselves maintain a force to police billing and weights , but a great many violations go undetected despite their efforts . We feel certain that the establishment of a minimum as recommended would result in greater harmony than exists now between the fines imposed by courts in different jurisdictions and practically eliminate violations of law which involve only comparatively small amounts of money . Verdicts or pleas of guilty have been obtained in 64 prosecutions brought under this section since 1920 . In 7 of these the fines imposed were substantial . The average fine in the remaining 57 cases , involving 478 counts , was only $151 per count . In 165 , or 34.5 per cent of those 478 counts , the highest fine imposed was $50 per count , and several were as low as $10 per count . Two defendants were sentenced to prison . Although the specific transactions punishable under Section 10 are different from those reached through the Elkins Act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ namely , preventing discrimination and maintaining the integrity of published rates . The  | Elkins Act carries a minimum penalty of $1000 , the maximum being $20,000 for each offense ... . Section 10 is vitally important in maintaining the regular tariff rates by compelling accurate and truthful description and classification by shippers of their property . Providing a minimum penalty of not less than $500 for each violation thereof , will render far more effective the efforts of the Commission to enforce that section . Section 15 of the act of 1887 only gave the Commission power to determine whether there had been a violation of the act and to order carriers to cease and desist from such violation . The power to prescribe maximum rates was given by the Hepburn Act of 1906 , and the power to prescribe reasonable classifications was given in 1910 . The present control of the Commission over rates and classifications as defined by the Transportation Act of 1920 will be considered in IV , I , 9 , infra ; but to make the historical development of that control clearer , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the act are given here as they stood before 1920 . The text is substantially derived from the Hepburn Act , but the words in parentheses were deleted and those underlined were added by the amending act of 1910 . SECTION 15. ( 1 ) That whenever , after full hearing upon a complaint made as provided in section thirteen of this act , ( or upon complaint of any common carrier ) , or after full hearing under an order for investigation and hearing made by the Commission on its own initiative ( either in extension of any pending complaint or without any complaint whatever ) , the Commission shall be of opinion that any individual or joint rates or charges whatsoever demanded , charged , or collected by any common carrier or carriers subject to the provisions of this act for the transportation of persons or property or for the transmission of messages by telegraph or telephone as defined in the first section of this act , or that any individual or joint classifications , regulations , or practices whatsoever of such carrier or carriers ( affecting such rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory , or unduly preferential or prejudicial or otherwise in violation of any of the provisions of this act , the Commission  | is hereby authorized and empowered ( and it shall be its duty ) to determine and prescribe what will be the just and reasonable individual or joint rate or rates , charge or charges , to be thereafter observed in such case as the maximum to be charged , and what individual or joint classification , regulation , or practice ( in respect to such transportation ) is just , fair , and reasonable , to be thereafter followed , and to make an order that the carrier or carriers shall cease and desist from such violation to the extent to which the Commission finds the same to exist , and shall not thereafter publish , demand , or collect any rate or charge for such transportation or transmission in excess of the maximum rate or charge so prescribed , and shall adopt the classification and shall conform to and observe the regulation or practice so prescribed . All orders of the Commission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect within such reasonable time , not less than thirty days , and shall continue in force for such period of time , not exceeding two years , as shall be prescribed in the order of the Commission , unless the same shall be suspended or modified or set aside by the Commission , or be suspended or set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction .

JUSTICE SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the court : This is a suit to annul , and enjoin the enforcement of , an order of the Interstate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereinafter designated as rail-andwater rates ) on cotton from points in Oklahoma , via Galveston and certain steamship lines , to New England destinations . The complaint before the Commission was brought by the Houston Cotton Exchange &; Board of Trade and other similar organizations against appellants and a number of other carriers , to have prescribed and established just and reasonable joint through rates on cotton from Oklahoma points through Texas ports to various points of destination in the northeastern part of the United States and Canada , including New England territory . The modified final order of the Commission required appellants to establish and maintain for the transportation of cotton from Oklahoma points , via Galveston and the lines of the Mallory Steamship Company and the Southern Pacific Company ? Atlantic Steamship Lines , to destinations in New England territory , joint rail-and-water rates not exceeding " rates 4 cents per 100 pounds lower than the present all-rail rates from and to the same points , " ? not , however , lower than $1.50 per 100 pounds . Prior to the Commission 's order , no joint rail-and-water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rate to New York consisted of the local rail rate to Galveston plus the water rate therefrom and a loading charge . To New England points , the rate was made by adding the rail rate beyond New York . The all-rail routes from Oklahoma to the New England territory points are through St. Louis , Memphis , and other Mississippi crossings ; and the joint all-rail rates were lower to New England destinations than the combination of local rail-and-water rates . On commodities other than cotton , joint rail-and-water rates were in effect , and these were lower than the all-rail rates . The Commission found that the establishment of joint rail-and-water rates on cotton between the points in question was desirable in the public interest , and that the existing rates for such transportation were unreasonable to the extent that they exceeded or may exceed rates constructed by  | the deduction of 4 cents from the present all-rail rates . 87 Inters . Com . Rep. 392 ; 93 Inters . Corn . Rep. 268 . The court below , consisting of three judges , after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of equity . 6 F. ( 2d ) 888 . Appellants assign twenty-one specifications of error ; but the objections to the Commission 's order , so far as necessary to be considered here , may be summarized as follows : ( 1 ) The Commission undertook to equalize rail-and-water rates with the all-rail rates , a power which it does not possess ; ( 2 ) if the order be treated as made under the power to fix reasonable rates , it is arbitrary and without supporting evidence ; ( 3 ) the result of the order is to short-haul appellants ' lines contrary t paragraph 4 , Section 15 , of the Interstate Commerce Act as amended by Section 418 of the Transportation Act ; and ( 4 ) the order is based upon paragraph ( 13 ) of Section 6 , added to the Interstate Commerce Act by the Panama Canal Act of August 24 , 1912 , chap . 390 , 37 Stat. at L. 560 , 568 , U. S. C. title 49 , Section 6 , and is , therefore , void because the authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First . Appellants ' argument under this head seems to be predicated upon the contention that the order of the Commission established an exact relationship between the rail-and-water rates and the present all-rail rates , the differential of 4 cents being , it is said , the amount charged by insurance companies as a premium for insurance to cover the risk of water transportation ; and that an analysis of the Cone mission 's order and report shows that the Commission itself recognized that it was undertaking to make such an equalization . The complaint before the Commission plainly sought the establishment of reasonable rates , and the order of the Commission directed the carriers to discontinue the then existing rates made up of combinations of local rates and substitute the maximum joint rates which were prescribed in the words already stated . The Commission found that rates were and would be unreasonable to the extent they exceeded or might exceed those prescribed . In form , the action of the Commission was responsive to the case made by the complaint , and to hold that , in fact , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equalizing rates would be to put undue stress upon certain recitals contained in the report , to which our attention is called but which need not be detailed . If these recitals stood alone , they might give plausibility to the contention ; but from a consideration of the entire record we think it quite unfair to conclude that the Commission undertook to exercise  | an authority entirely different and distinct from that which the complaint specifically invoked ... . It is true , the order fixes the rail-and-water rate by relating it in terms to the all-rail rate ; but , since we accept the view that the former was , in fact , established as a just and reasonable rate , there can be no objection to the form of words adopted as a method of short and convenient description of that rate . The power of the Commission to equalize rates , if its authority to that end should be invoked , is not involved . Second .... Nothing is to be gained by a review of the evidence . It is enough to say that both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justify the order , and , upon a consideration of the entire record , we find no reason to differ with them in that conclusion . Third . Does the order of the Commission result in short-hauling appellants ' lines contrary to the provisions of paragraph 4 of Sect ion 15 of the Interstate Commerce Act , as amended by the Transport at ion Act , 1920 ? The pertinent provision of that paragraph is that the Commission , in establishing a through route , shall not , " except where one of the carriers is a water line , " require any railroad carrier to embrace in such route substantially less than the entire length of its railroad lying between the termini of the proposed through route . That the through routes here established by the Commission 's order do embrace substantially less than the entire length of appellants ' railroads , etc. , is not denied . And appellants ' contention is that the exception , " where one of the carriers is a water line , " has reference only to such a carrier as comes within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides , among other things , that the provisions of the act shall apply to common carriers engaged in " ( a ) the transportation of passengers or property wholly by railroad , or partly by railroad and partly by water when both are used under a common control , management , or arrangement for a continuous carriage or shipment ; ... " chap . 91 , 41 Stat .. at L. 456 , 474 , U. S. C. title 49 , Section 1 . Appellees insist that the rail and water lines here involved come within the italicized portion of this provision . But it is unnecessary to pass upon that question , since clearly the order in this respect can be sustained under the later and broader provisions of paragraph ( 13 ) of Section 6 , added to the Interstate Commerce Act by the Panama Canal Act , supra ....   This addition to the Interstate Commerce Act materially extends the jurisdiction of the Commission in respect of land and water transportation and the carriers engaged in it , whenever property may be or is transported in interstate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriers ; and the obvious intention of Congress would be substantially limited in effect if the . . . provisions were held to be subject to the restriction that both rail and water must be used under a common control , etc . The phrase , " except where one of the carriers is a water line , " was introduced in an amendment made to the Interstate Commerce Act by the Transportation Act , 1920 , and it is not unreasonable to include within the scope of its reference , the then existing paragraph ( 13 ) of Section 6 . And this view is strengthened by the consideration that the Transportation Act , 1920 , as a part of the new policy which it introduced in respect of the regulation of interstate transportation ( Railroad Commission v. Chicago , B. &; Q. R. Co. , 257 U. S. 563 , 585 ; New England Divisions Case ( Akron , C. &; Y. R. Co. v. United States ) , 261 U. S. 184 , 189 , directed the Commission to establish through routes , joint classifications , etc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever deemed by it to be necessary or desirable in the public interest , " etc. 41 Stat. at L. 485 , chap . 91 , U. S. C. title 49 , Section 15 . And the same act declares it to be " the policy of Congress to promote , encourage , and develop water transportation , service , and facilities in connection with the commerce of the United States , and to foster and preserve in full vigor both rail and water transportation . " Section 500 , 41 Stat. at L. 499 , chap . 91 , U. S. C. title 49 , Section 142 . These and other provisions emphasize the intention of Congress to broaden the control of the Interstate Commerce Commission over rail-and-water transportation and , generally , to extend the regulatory power of that body over all such transportation in the public interest . It would be quite inconsistent with that broad purpose to adopt the narrow construction of the statutory provisions under review which is advanced by appellants . On the whole , and especially in the light of the definite congressional policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejecting the construction thus advanced and adopting that which we have indicated , without , at the same time , doing violence to the fair meaning of the language actually employed . Fourth . In disposing of the final objection , little need be said . The contention is that the Commission was without power to predicate its order on paragraph ( 13 ) of Section 6 of the act , because there is no   formal reference in the complaint to that paragraph nor an order for an investigation under it on the Commission 's own motion . But the allegations of the complaint in matters of fact were sufficient to authorize the Commission to consider the case under that provision as well as others ; and this is enough . To plead the law relied on , is no more necessary in a proceeding before the Commission than it is in a judicial proceeding . Decree affirmed . The pertinent statutory provisions are found in the Interstate Commerce Act , Section 15 , paragraphs 1-7 , 13 , and 14 ( I. C. Act , pp. 37-40 , 44 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act of 1920 . The text of paragraphs 1 , 2 , 3 , and 6 before 1920 is found in IV , I , 6 , supra . The substance of paragraph 4 was enacted in the Commerce Court Act of 1910 ; but the Transportation Act introduced the parenthetic exception in the first clause and added the  | proviso , besides making several minor changes . Paragraph 5 is entirely new ; paragraph 7 in its present form has been considered in IV , I , 7 , supra ; paragraph 13 is old paragraph 8 ( see IV , G , 6 , supra ) ; paragraph 14 was introduced by the Hepburn Act of 1906 . Upon application of the New England railways ( except the Boston and Albany and branches of Canadian railways ) the Interstate Commerce Commission , acting under paragraph 6 of Section 15 , on January 30 , 1922 , ordered an increase of 15 per cent in the divisions , or shares , of the New England carriers in the joint through class rates on freight moving between that section and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Akron , Canton , and Youngstown Railway Company and other carriers operating west of New England petitioned a Federal district court to enjoin the enforcement of the order and asked to have it set aside as void . The injunction was denied , and the plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court.  | MR . JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the court : ... Plaintiffs urge six reasons why the order of the Commission should be held void . First . It is contended that the order is void , because its purpose was not to establish divisions just , reasonable and equitable , as between connecting carriers , but , in the public interest , to relieve the financial needs of the New England lines , so as to keep them in effective operation . The argument is that Congress did not authorize the Commission to exercise its power to accomplish that purpose . An order , regular on its face , may , of course , be set aside if made to accomplish a purpose not authorized . Compare Southern P. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here assailed is not subject to that infirmity . Transportation Act 1920 introduced into the Federal legislation a new railroad policy . Railroad Commission v. Chicago , B. &; Q. R. Co. , 257 U. S. 563 , 585 . Theretofore , the effort of Congress had been directed mainly to the prevention of abuses ; particularly , those arising from excessive or discriminatory rates . The 1920 Act sought to insure , also , adequate transportation service . That such was its purpose , Congress did not leave to inference . The new purpose was expressed in unequivocal language . . . . And to attain it , new rights , new obligations , new machinery , were created . The new provisions took in a wide range . . . . Prominent among them are those specially designed to secure a fair return on capital devoted to the transportation service . . . . Upon the Commission new powers were conferred and new duties were imposed . The credit of the carriers , as a whole , had been seriously impaired . To preserve for the nation substantially the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds were needed , not only for improvement and expansion of facilities , but for adequate maintenance . On some , continued operation would be impossible unless additional revenues were procured . A general rate increase alone would not meet the situation . There was a limit to what the traffic would bear . A 5 per cent increase had been granted in 1914 ( Five Per Cent Case , 31 Inters . Corn . Rep. 351 ; 32 Inters . Coln . Rep. 325 ) ; 15 per cent in 1917 ( Fifteen Per Cent Case , 45 Inters . Corn . Rep. 303 ) ; 25 per cent in 1918 ( General Order of Director General , No. 28 ) . Moreover , it was not clear that the people would tolerate greatly increased rates ( although no higher than necessary to produce the required revenues of weak lines ) if thereby prosperous competitors p 300 earned an unreasonably large return upon the value of their properties . The existence of the varying needs of the several lines and of their widely varying earning power was fully realized . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure revenues adequate to satisfy the needs of the weak carriers . To accomplish this two new devices were adopted ; the group system of rate-making and the division of joint rates in the public interest . Through the former , weak roads were to be helped by recapture from prosperous competitors of surplus revenues . Through the latter , the weak were to be helped by preventing needed revenue from passing to prosperous connections . Thus , by marshaling the revenues , partly through capital account , it was planned to distribute augmented earnings , largely in proportion to the carrier 's needs . This , it was hoped , would enable the whole transportation system to be maintained , without raising unduly any rate on any line . The provision concerning divisions was , therefore , an integral part of the machinery for distributing the funds expected to be raised by the new rate-fixing sections . It was , indeed , indispensable . Raising joint rates for the benefit of the weak carriers might be the only feasible method of obtaining currently the needed revenues . Local rates might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local traffic . The through joint rates might be so low that they could be raised without proving burdensome . On the other hand , the revenues of connecting carriers might be ample ; so that any increase of their earnings from joint rates would be unjustifiable . Where the through traffic would , under those circumstances , bear an increase of the joint rates , it might be proper to raise them , and give to the weak line the whole of the resulting increase in revenue . That , to some extent , may have been the situation in New England , when , in 1920 , the Commission was confronted with the duty , under the new section 15a , of raising rates so as to yield a return of substantially 6 per cent on the value of the property used in the transportation service . Ex parte 74 , Increased Rates , 1920 , 58 Inters . Com . Rep. 220 ... . The deficiency in income of the New England lines in 1920 was so great that ( even before the raise in wages ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenues of 47.40 per cent was estimated to be necessary to secure to them a fair return . On a like estimate , the increased revenues required to give the same return to carriers in Trunk Line territory was only 29.76 per cent , and to carriers in Central Freight Association territory 24.31 per cent . . . . To have  | raised the additional revenues needed by the New England lines wholly by raising the rates within New England ? particularly when rates west of the Hudson were raised much less ? might have killed New England traffic . Rates there had already been subjected ( besides the three general increases mentioned above ) to a special increase , applicable only to New England , of about 10 per cent in 1918 . Re Proposed Increases in New England , 49 Inters . Corn . Rep. 421 . A further large increase in rates local to New England would , doubtless , have provoked more serious competition from auto-trucks and water carriers . For hauls are short and the ocean is near . Instead of erecting New England into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other two subdivisions of Official Classification territory , into the Eastern group ; and ordered that freight rates in that group be raised 40 per cent . At that rate level the revenues of the carriers in Trunk Line and Central Freight Association territories would , it was asserted , exceed by 1.48 per cent what they would have received if they had been a separate group . It was estimated that the excess would be about $25,000,000.1 Substantially that amount ( besides the additional revenue to be raised otherwise ) was said to be necessary to meet the needs of the New England lines . Plaintiffs insist that Transportation Act 1920 did not , by its amend- . ment of Section 15 ( 6 ) , change , or add to , the factors to be considered by the Commission in passing upon divisions ; that it had theretofore been the Commission 's practice to consider all the factors enumerated in Section 15 ( 6 ) ; . . . that this enumeration merely put into statutory form the interpretation theretofore adopted ; that the only new feature was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divisions on the Commission 's initiative ; that this authority was conferred in order to protect the short lines , which , because of their weakness , might refrain from making complaint , for fear of giving offense ; .. . and that the power conferred upon the Commission is coextensive only with the duty imposed on the carriers by Section 400 of Transportation Act 1920 , which declares that they shall establish " in case of joint rates . . . just , reasonable , and equitable divisions thereof as between the carriers subject to this act participating therein which shall not unduly prefer or prejudice any of such participating carriers . " It is true that Section 12 of the act of June ' 18 , 1910 , chap . 309 , 36 Stat. at L. 539 , 551 , 552 , which first conferred upon the Commission authority  | to establish or adjust divisions , ... did not , in terms , confer upon the Commission power to act on its own initiative . The language of the act seemed to indicate that the authority was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and only in supplement to some order fixing the rates . . . . The extent of the Commission 's power was a subject of doubt ; and Transportation Act 1920 undertook , by Section 15 ( 6 ) , to remove doubts which had arisen . But Congress had , also , the broader purpose explained above . This is indicated , among other things , by expressions used in dealing with joint rates . By new Section 15 ( 6 ) , p. 486 , the Commission is directed to give due consideration , in determining divisions , to " the importance to the public of the transportation services of such carrier " ; . . just as , by new Section 15 ( 3 ) , p. 485 , the Commission is authorized , upon its own initiative , when " desirable in the public interest , " to establish joint rates and " the divisions of such rates . " Second . It is contended that if the act be construed as authorizing such apportionment of a joint rate on the basis of the greater needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no claim that the apportionment results in confiscatory rates , nor is there in this record any basis for such a contention . The argument is that the division of a joint rate is essentially a partition of property ; that the rate must be divided on the basis of the services rendered by the several carriers ; that there is no difference between taking part of one 's just share of a joint rate , and taking from a carrier part of the cash in its treasury ; and , thus , that apportionment according to needs is a taking of property without due process . But the argument begs the question . What is its just share ? It is the amount properly apportioned out of the joint rate . That amount is to be determined not by an agreement of the parties or by mileage . It is to be fixed by the Commission , ? fixed at what that board finds to be just , reasonable , and equitable . Cost of the service is one of the elements in rate-making . It may be just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate than of the original rate . Whether the rate is reasonable may depend largely upon the disposition which is to be made of the revenues derived therefrom . What the Commission did was to raise the additional revenues needed by the New England lines , in part directly , through increase of all rates 40 per cent , and , in part indirectly , through increasing their divisions on joint rates . In other words , the additional revenues needed were raised partly by a direct , partly by an indirect , tax . It is  | not true , as argued , that the order compels the strong railroads to support the weak . No part of the revenues needed by the New England lines is paid by the Western carriers . All is paid by the community , pursuant to the single rate increase ordered in Ex parte 74 . If , by a single order , the Commission had raised joint rates throughout the Eastern group 40 per cent , and , in the same order , had declared that 90 per cent of the whole increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines ( in addition to what they would receive under existing divisions ) , clearly nothing would have been taken from the Trunk Line and Central Freight Association carriers , in so ordering . The order entered in Ex parte 74 was at all times subject to change . The special needs of the New England lines were at all times before the Commission . That these needs were met by two orders instead of one is not of legal significance . The order here in question may properly be deemed a supplement to , or modification of , that entered in Ex parte 74 . Third . It is asserted that the order is necessarily based upon the theory that , under Section 15 ( 6 ) , the Commission has authority to fix divisions as between groups of carriers without considering the carriers individually ; that Congress did not confer such authority ; and that , hence , the order is void . Whether Congress did confer that authority we have no occasion to consider ; for it is clear that the Commission did not base its order upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent increase in the divisions to the several New England lines . It is comprehensive . But it is based upon evidence which the Commission assumed was typical in character and ample in quantity to justify the finding be discussed later . Here we are to consider merely , whether Congress authorized the methods of proof and of adjudication pursued , and whether it could authorize it , consistently with the Constitution . Obviously , Congress intended that a method should be pursued by which the task , which it imposed upon the Commission , could be performed . The number of carriers which might be affected by an order of the Commission , if the power granted were to be exercised fully , might far exceed six hundred ; the number of rates involved , many millions . The weak roads were many . The need to be met was urgent . To require specific evidence and separate adjudication , in respect to each division of each rate of each carrier , would be tantamount to denying the possibility of granting relief . We must assume that  | Congress knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been confronted with similar situations in the past , and how it had dealt with them . For many years before the enactment of Transportation Act 1920 it had been necessary , from time to time , to adjudicate comprehensively upon substantially all rates in a large territory . When such rate changes were applied for , the Commission made them by a single order ; and , in large part , on evidence deemed typical of the whole rate structure .... This remained a common practice after the burden of proof to show that a proposed increase of any rate was reasonable had been declared , by act of June 18 , 1910 , chap . 309 , Section 12 , 36 Stat. at L. 539 , 551 , 552 , to be upon the carrier . Many cases are cited . Thus , the practice did not have its origin in the group system of rate-making provided for in 1920 by the new Section 15a . It was the actual necessities of procedure and administration which had led to the adoption of that method , in passing upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopting a similar course when multitudes of divisions were to be passed upon was obvious . The method was equally appropriate in such inquiries ; . . . and we must assume that Congress intended to confer upon the Commission power to pursue it ... . That there is no constitutional obstacle to the adoption of the method pursued is clear . Congress may , consistently with the dueprocess clause , create rebuttable presumptions ( Mobile , J. &; K. C. R. Co. v. Turnipseed , 219 U.S. 35 ; Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co. , 220 U.S. 61 ) , and shift the burden of proof ( Minneapolis &; St. L. R. Co. v. Minnesota , 193 U.S. 53 ) . It might , therefore , have declared in terms , that if the Commission finds that evidence introduced is typical of traffic and operating conditions , and of the joint rates and divisions of the carriers of a group , it may be accepted as prima facie evidence bearing upon the proper divisions of each joint rate of every carrier in that group . Congress did so provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duty of determining the divisions . For only in that way could the task be performed . As pointed out in Railroad Commission v. Chicago , B. &; Q. R. Co. , 257 U.S. 563 , 579 , serious injustice to any carrier could be avoided by availing of the saving clause which allows anyone to except itself from the order , in whole or in part , on proper showing . Fourth . It is asserted that the order directs a transfer of revenues of the Western carrier to the New England carriers , pending a decision  | in the matter of divisions ; that Congress has not granted authority to take such provisional action ; and that , hence , the order is void . The argument is , that under Section 15 ( 6 ) , the Commission may prescribe divisions only when , upon full hearing , it is of opinion that those existing are , or will be , unjust , unreasonable , or inequitable ; that in such event it shall prescribe divisions which are just , reasonable , and equitable ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been a full one . Whet her a hearing was full must be determined by the character of the hearing , not by that of the order entered thereon . A full hearing is one in which ample opportunity is afforded to all parties to make , by evidence and argument , a showing fairly adequate to establish the propriety or impropriety , from the standpoint of justice and law , of the step asked to be taken . The Commission recognized , and observed , these essentials of a full hearing ... . A hearing may be a full one , although the evidence introduced does not enable the tribunal to dispose of the issues completely or permanently ; and although the tribunal is convinced , when entering the order thereon , that , upon further investigation , some changes in it will have to be made . To grant , under such circumstances , immediate relief , subject to later readjustments , was no more a transfer of revenues pending a decision than was the like action , in cases involving general increases in rates , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treasury of the carriers . That the order is not obnoxious to the due-process clause , because provisional , is clear . If this were not so , most temporary injunctions would violate the Constitution . Fifth . It is contended that the order is void because it confines itself to dealing with the main , or primary , divisions of the joint rates at the Hudson River , and fails to prescribe the subdivisions of that part of the rate which goes to the several carriers . . . . There was , thus , on the part of the Commission , neither usurpation of power nor neglect of duty , in limiting its definite decision to the primary divisions at the Hudson River gateways , and leaving the interested parties to deal , in the first instance , with the subdivisions among the carriers in their respective territories . . . . Sixth . It is contended that the order is void , because it is unsupported by evidence . . . . That the evidence was ample to support the order made is shown in the opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 308 , 309 ) , and in the reports of the Commission ... .  | EASTMAN , Commissioner : ...

We are asked to establish and put in force the desired through routes and joint rates , including such rules , regulations , and practices as may be necessary , with reasonable and fair divisions to the barge line . The through routes described cover practically the entire country , and are sought in all cases where there are now through all-rail routes made up in part of a rail line between ports served by the barge line . Joint rates made differentially lower than the corresponding all-rail rates are desired , and divisions upon the plan proposed by the barge line in No. 11893 .. . That portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the complaints related to demurrage , switching , and other terminal charges . For at least twenty years prior to the operation of the barge line there was no common carriage of consequence on the lower Mississippi . Investment in boat lines was no doubt deterred to some extent by the readiness with which competing rail lines cut rates to meet even potential water competition . The recurring periods of rail congestion and shortage of equipment , however , gradually stimulated interest in the development of inland waterways , including the Mississippi River . During the acute traffic conditions in the Mississippi Valley in the winter of 1917 the commercial interests of New Orleans , Louisiana , and St. Louis , Missouri , undertook the formation and financing of a corporation to build a number of towboats and barges for operation between St. Louis and New Orleans . Due to war conditions they were unable to secure the steel necessary for the purpose . After the passage of the Federal Control Act in 1918 an appeal was made under the provisions of Section 6 , which authorized the president to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or desirable for the utilization and operation of canals , or for the purchase , construction , or utilization and operation of boats , barges , tugs , and other transportation facilities on the inland , canal , and coastwise waterways . . . . " A committee appointed by the Director General of Railroads to investigate and report recommended the utilization of the lower Mis- sissippi River and the so-called Warrior River waterway . The utilization of the latter was to provide service between the Alabama coal and ore districts and the ports of Mobile , Alabama , and New Orleans . Both projects were authorized in modified form in June , 1918 . In the following month a Federal manager was appointed and instructed to commandeer and put in operation as soon as possible all available equipment on both waterways capable of being used for the transportation of freight , and also to proceed with the construction of a new fleet authorized by the Director General . The Transportation Act , 1920 , transferred the barge line from the railroad administration to the Secretary of War , and provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operated such transport at ion facilities so that the lines of inland water transportation established by or through the President during Federal control shall be continued .... " It also made the barge line subject to the Interstate Commerce Act to the same extent as if privately owned and operated . The Mississippi River service is between St. Louis and New Orleans and the barges also touch at East St. Louis and Cairo , Illinois , Memphis , Tennessee , and Vicksburg , Mississippi . The barge line makes no attempt to serve the smaller river landings . The Warrior River service is between Cordova and Birmingport , Alabama , on the Black Warrior River , and New Orleans , Mobile , and the intermediate river ports of Demopolis and Tuscaloosa , Alabama ... . Port-to-port rates were established by the railroad administration upon the inauguration of water service and in all instances were made 80 per cent of the corresponding all-rail rates , except that on coal from points on the Warrior the differential was made 20 cents per ton , or substantially less than 20 per cent . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barge line , and they were apparently based , not so much upon estimated economy in operation compared with rail service , as upon the difference in the value of the service to the shipper , the barge service being less convenient and much slower than the rail service . The barge-line management thinks experience has shown that the differentials could not without loss of traffic be made any less . . . . The record contains many comparisons with differentials maintained by other water lines . There is no uniformity in these differentials ; some are relatively smaller and some relatively greater than the differentials of the barge line . It is also evident that the service afforded by the barge line is in no way comparable with the service afforded by ocean or lake steamships .  | Roughly speaking , joint rates with rail carriers now apply as follows : The territory covered by the joint rates in Kentucky and Tennessee is limited , and only a few points in Kansas , Nebraska , and Georgia are reached . . With one exception , all of the joint rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the amount of the port-to-port differential ... . The barge line lays stress upon the fact that the practical elimination for many years of service by water has created conditions which make joint rates with connecting rail carriers of unusual importance to the maintenance of its service ... . In dividing the original joint rail-and-barge rates which became effective via the St. Louis gateway in March , 1919 , the railroad administration adopted the principle that the rail lines should receive the same revenue as they would receive if the traffic moved all rail via the same gateway . It was felt that the barge line should bear the whole burden of the differential between the rail-and-barge and the all-rail rates . . . . On December 15 , 1919 , after the extension of the rail-and-barge  | service , the barge line was advised by the director of the division of inland waterways of a proposed new basis of divisions in connection not only with the new joint rates but with those previously authorized , as follows : .. ( a ) Where the water-and-rail route is not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its local rate . The expense of transfer , over and above that which would occur as between rail carriers , to be assumed by the water line . ( b ) If joint rates are established in connection with the water lines via junctions where divisions of the all-rail rates are effective , the rail carrier shall receive its proportion of the all-rail rates as arrived at by such division . The expense of transfer , over and above that which would occur as between rail carriers , to be assumed by the water line . ( c ) Where all-rail rates are in effect between the points to be served by the water-and-rail routes , and the all-rail rates do not divide at t he junction with the water line , the revenue of the rail line shall be determined as follows : ( 1 ) The rail lines shall receive beyond the nearest prorating point their established proportions of the all-rail rates . ( 2 ) From the point at which freight is delivered to , or received from , the water line up to or from such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a division of the remainder of the all-rail rate worked out on the short rail route between the points , and , for this purpose , these short-line mileages shall be divided on forty-mile blocks with an additional forty miles for terminal . The rail portion of the rail-and-water route shall receive the number of blocks represented by the distance to and from the water carrier , plus the forty-mile terminal . ( 3 ) Before determining divisions , as outlined above , where it is customary to deduct arbitraries , before prorating in the division of the all-rail rate , such arbitraries are to be deducted and added to the proportions of the all-rail lines . ( 4 ) In figuring percentages on block basis , above outlined , a minimum of 25 per cent shall accrue to either line . ( 5 ) The expense of transfer , over and above that which would occur as between rail carriers , to be assumed by the water line . The barge line on February 5 , 1920 , protested against this basis of divisions , but it became effective on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force . . . . Every paragraph of the foregoing basis is criticized by the barge line . . . . The details of this criticism are omitted for lack of space.  | In lieu of the present plan , the barge line asks that we establish the following basis for dividing the joint rail-and-barge and rail-barge-andrail rates which are now in effect and which it seeks to have established , and for apportioning the expense at transfer points : ... The text of the plan is omitted , but the essence of that portion which deals with the determination of divisions is given in the following paragraph . The foregoing plan contemplates the establishment of divisions on what is known as the mileage-prorate basis , using actual distances of the rail lines from and to the points of interchange and certain constructive distances for the barge line . The constructive mileages were arrived at by taking 80 per cent of the average distances by rail over several practicable routes , in each case , between the various ports and stating the results thus obtained in the nearest multiple of 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual distances traversed by the barges from port to port . Thus , the constructive mileage between St. Louis and New Orleans is 600 miles , while the minimum distance by water is 1153.6 miles . Between Birmingport and New Orleans the constructive mileage is 325 miles , while the minimum water distance is 584 miles . From the use of these constructive mileages some misunderstanding has arisen as to the purpose which they are intended to serve . It has been rather generally assumed that they represent an attempt to equate the cost of service by barge with the cost of service by rail , upon the theory that the cost of rail transportation for the constructive distance is equal to the cost of barge service for the actual distance . It does not appear that they have been based upon such a theory . On the contrary , study of the barge line 's proposal leads to the conclusion that it is really founded upon a modification of the theory which underlies the division basis of the railroad administration . Under that plan the rail carriers were to receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traffic moved all rail . The effect of the barge line 's proposal is to give the rail lines what it deems would be fair and reasonable divisions if the traffic moved all rail . Stating the matter differently , the essence of the barge line 's position is that it does not . believe that the divisions which the rail lines are now receiving in many cases are fair and reasonable divisions all rail . The basis for this belief has already been indicated . It relates particularly to the ports which are not now favored points  | of interchange between rail carriers and where the divisions are frequently the local rates , and sometimes exceed such rates . Confronted by such divisions , which it regards as extortionate , the barge line has attempted to devise a method , simple and easily applied , for determining divisions fair to the rail lines either on all-rail or on rail-and-barge traffic . In devising this method , the barge line seems to have started with the fact that divisions between rail lines are often based on mileage . The central-territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Louis and Cairo . Applying the same principle to the of her gateways , the barge line assumes that fair all-rail divisions would he determined by mileage ; but to figure rail divisions in this way and t lien deduct them from the differentially lower rail-and-barge rates to determine the barge line 's divisions would be an awkward process . In order that the mileage method may be applied directly to the differentially lower rate , therefore , the barge line uses for the factor between the ports approximately 80 per cent of the average all-rail distance , corresponding to the 80 per cent port-to-port rate which the barge line maintains in comparison with the rail rate between the ports ... . ... It is the barge line 's position that it can not live on port-to-port traffic alone , and that the economical form of transportation which it provides ought for the good of the country to be opened to public use as widely as possible by the extension of the system of joint rates . The complaint in No. 13290 practically covers the entire country and asks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up in part of a rail line between ports served by the barge line .... The defendant rail carriers , with one accord , protest that they are not hostile to the barge line , and that their attitude since its inception has been one of proper cooperation . They feel strongly , however , that it is but just and fair that the barge line should undertake to be successful on its merits and not at the expense of its rail connections , and that the " waterway ought to be used where it constitutes a real contribution to the national economy , but ought not to be used where the contrary is the case . " The cardinal principle which they urge  | with respect to the divisions in question is that which the railroad administration attempted to follow , namely , that the rail carriers shall accept the same divisions on traffic interchanged with the barge line as they receive on similar traffic interchanged with rail connections , the additional expense , if any , of interchange with the barge line to be borne by the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing divisions are fair and reasonable , but they also contend that the burden of proof to show the contrary is upon the barge line and that it has wholly failed to sustain this burden ... . All of the defendants stress the advantages which the barge line has in cost of operation . Terminals , both as a matter of capital and of operating expense , are a great and continually increasing burden upon the rail lines of the country . The barge line has no like expense , its terminals and warehouses being principally owned by the port cities , which charge nominal rent . Moreover , the river is its roadbed , the expense of keeping it navigable is borne by the government , and it has no taxes to pay . We are asked to note that no cost data have been submitted which would enable us to compare the cost of hauling freight per unit by barge with the similar cost by rail . The rail carriers not only defend existing divisions at the St. Louis and Cairo gateways , but they also , with certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exaction of local rates as divisions at the other Mississippi or Warrior ports . It is a matter of indifference , they point out , to the lines operating in central and western trunk-line territories , whether the haul south of the gateway is by barge or by rail ; but between points in southern territory the situation is quite different . Much of the latter traffic in which the barge line seeks to participate could move between origin and destination over a single rail line . When part of the haul is by barge there is a distinct and positive loss to the Southern rail carriers and an additional terminal expense which would not otherwise be incurred . While the law now permits us to compel the establishment of through routes between rail and water carriers which short-haul the rail carriers , it does not require us , defendants claim , to establish such routes unless we deem them in the public interest ; nor are we estopped , when they are established , from taking the sacrifice on the part of the rail carriers into consideration in the fixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , defendants say that many of the rail lines reaching such ports as Memphis , Vicksburg , and  | more particularly the ports on the Warrior are branch lines , built as pioneer projects , operating under unfavorable conditions , and designed to feed the main rail lines . Why , they ask , when such lines are diverted from their original purpose and converted into feeders of the barge line , should this fact not weigh in the fixing of divisions ? And why should the high cost of operation over such lines be ignored ? The haul to the port for delivery to the barge line is in fact , they claim , no less expensive than the haul to which their local rate applies ... . The barge line 's proposed new basis of divisions would result , defendants feel , in great injustice to them . The constructive mileages used between the ports are , in one or two cases , greater than the short-line rail distance , but aside from this fact they contend that the proposal is a scheme for prorating divisions on the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic , or other factors which must be considered if justice is to be done . They illustrate this by the fact that while density of traffic is normally greater on the east side than on the west side of the Mississippi River , and still greater in central and western trunk-line territories , yet under the barge line 's proposal mileage is in every case to be given the same weight in the fixing of divisions ... . Voluminous exhibits were submitted by defendants to show the effect of the barge line 's proposal . In many cases it would afford the rail lines lower ton-mile earnings for the short hauls to the ports than if they carried the traffic all rail to destination . This is especially true in cases , which they say are frequent on the Warrior route , where the rail-and-barge haul is particularly circuitous in comparison with the all-rail haul . In some cases the barge line 's division , under its proposal , would be greater than its local rate between the ports . In many more cases its proposal would reduce the existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rail-and-barge rate . This , defendants say , is proof that the barge line is asking the rail carriers to bear the burden of the differential ... . ... Elaborate analyses of the proposed through routes and joint rates were submitted , showing that in many cases rail-barge-and-rail routes are proposed , and in some cases rail-and-barge routes , where the rail portion of the joint haul would be longer than the short-line allrail route . Such through routes , they contend , particularly if a joint  | rate lower than the all-rail rate is to be applied , are plainly wasteful of transportation and economically unsound . They further show , by these analyses , that in many cases the proposed joint rates , constructed on the differential basis , would result in violations of the fourth section . In other words , the joint railand-barge rate would be lower than the rail rate between the interior point and the port of interchange . Another most serious result , they claim , would be the disruption of long-standing and delicate rate relationships ... . Another curious result , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed , would be that they would be higher in some instances for shorter than for longer hauls ... . These complaints are vast in their scope , covering as they do the divisions of thousands of existing joint rates , the establishment of thousands of proposed through routes and joint rates , the complicated switching movements and charges at several large ports , and various incidental but nevertheless troublesome questions . To a large extent they raise questions which in many of their aspects are novel , involving the relations between rail carriers and an experimental form of water service . In our judgment the best disposition of these complaints for the present is to state our conclusions as to the general principles which should control the decision of the issues . The application of these principles through specific orders to the multitudinous situations which are covered by the complaints is a task which we ought not to be compelled , in the first instance at least , to undertake . The rail carriers and this new enterprise which is owned and operated by the government ought to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way , to compose their differences in friendly negotiation , and we have faith that they will be able to do so . The proceedings before us , however , will not be closed , but will be kept open for further and more specific action , if that proves necessary . . . . The Mississippi-Warrior service is owned and operated by the government , as we understand the situation , not necessarily as a permanent governmental undertaking , but to test the possibilities of transportation by barge upon these great inland waterways . In view of the experience that the country has had with recurrent rail congestion and car shortages and with increased rates , the possibilities which  | these waterways offer as a means of adding to the sum total of transportation facilities and of providing a cheaper form of carriage are plainly of prime public importance . Clearly everything that can be done ought to be done to give this experiment a fair opportunity to demonstrate its worth , and in this endeavor the project should be viewed in the light of the service which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the difficulties and embarrassments which surround every new enterprise and particularly one which has been compelled to start life with a heritage of worn-out and inadequate facilities . On the other hand , it is equally clear that the experiment will not be fairly conducted if the barge line is permitted to tap the resources of the rail lines by depriving them in any way of just compensation for the services which they perform in connection with its operation . Turning first to divisions , no formula has yet been devised , so far as we are aware , which can be uniformly and justly applied under all circumstances to determine the fair divisions between rail lines of joint rates , and still less when one of the participating carriers is a barge line . We are unable to approve the formula which has been suggested in No. 11893 by the barge line . Although based on rail mileages between ports rather than on barge mileages , it is essentially a plan for dividing rates by using distance proportions and without giving adequate consideration to terminal expense , varying densities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar factors which affect a just division . Nor have we evidence which would enable us to apportion rates , either singly or by ports or by territorial groups , in accordance with the relative costs of rail and of barge transportation . As the barge line suggests , its own costs per unit of freight handled are largely dependent upon the amount of traffic handled . Obviously the only feasible approach to the determination of fair divisions , under the circumstances , is the one which was used by the railroad administration . As a basic proposition , we accept in the main the principle that the rail lines should receive the same revenue as they would receive if the traffic moved all rail via the same gateway . However , the attempt to apply this principle has , we believe , shown that it is subject to certain important qualifications . It goes without saying that , if the division  | received by a rail carrier on traffic moved all rail by the same gateway c n be shown to be excessive , it will ordinarily be excessive when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does not necessarily follow that if the all-rail division is fair , it is under all circumstances a fair division for rail-and-barge traffic ... While the law does not permit us to require rail carriers to establish through routes which result in the short-hauling of one carrier which has a reasonably direct route of its own , it is , perhaps , not a necessary conclusion , when such routes and joint rates are established , that local rates are fair divisions for the carrier which is short-hauled . However , the law now authorizes us to require the establishment of through rail-and-water routes and joint rates which short-haul a rail carrier , and the reasons are evident . If a water route were dependent for feeders upon rail lines which can deliver traffic to it without short-hauling themselves , it would draw little traffic from the interior except at ports , like St. Louis , which happen to be a meeting point of rail lines serving different territories . Carrying this thought to its logical conclusion , if the rail lines of the country were owned by a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal supply of feeders ; but if the rail lines were all one consolidated system , it would be wholly deprived of feeders , Yet its status as a useful and economical means of transportation would be the same in the one event as in the other . Clearly the usefulness of water routes to interior points ought not to be dependent upon the extent to which rail lines are consolidated , and Congress has wisely recognized this in the law . It follows , whatever may be the case as between rail lines , that joint rates over rail-and-water routes ought to be divided without regard to the extent to which rail carriers may be short-hauled , and not upon a plan designed to discourage or render impracticable the use of such joint rates . The record shows that the exaction by rail lines of their local rates as divisions under such circumstances has for its admitted purpose the protection of the long haul . In other words , it is a means of accomplishing indirectly what Congress , in the law respecting the establishment of through routes and joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that the rail lines will in the long run suffer in such situations from more liberal divisions to water carriers . . . . And this leads to consideration of the character and purpose of joint rates . A line participating in a joint rate does not prove that it is entitled to a division equal to its local rate by showing that the service which it performs in connection with the joint haul is no less expensive  | than its local service . That may be a reason why a joint rate lower than the combination of locals should not have been established , but it does not demonstrate that the carrier should have an amount equal to its local as its fair share of the joint rate which has been established . Nor does it prove , necessarily , that the joint rate should not have been established . As was said in Chattanooga Packet Co. v. I. C. R. R. Co. 133 I. C. C. 384 , at page 392 : " It is a generally accepted principle of rate-making , which has frequently found expression in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than the sum of the intermediate rates . " This is a principle which , like other principles of rate-making , is not wholly dependent upon immediate costs of service . It looks also to the future and recognizes that such joint rates stimulate commerce and business and induce a flow of traffic which in itself has a tendency to lessen the cost of service . This thought has particular force in the situation here presented . The barge line is a new and experimental project . It is attempting to induce a flow of traffic through gateways some of which have heretofore been little used for corresponding rail movements . If it is successful in this experiment , the rail lines feeding into these gateways will gain an importance and a strength which they do not now have , and the cost of service will be reduced . This is especially true of the new gateways on the Warrior River . We are therefore not persuaded , in the instances where the present rail divisions of the rail-and-barge rates are equal to or exceed the local rail rates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , that it is being fairly treated in all other situations . How the divisions should be changed in such cases is a more difficult question , but we are impressed by the offer of the Alabama &; Vicksburg and the Vicksburg , Shreveport &; Pacific . These lines are viewing the problem as feeders rather than as competitors of the barge line .... They are willing to divide on a rate-prorate basis , using the rail class rates between the interior point and the port of interchange and the rail class rates between the port of interchange and the port of origin or destination as factors . The record also shows that in many cases where the present rail divisions are divisions upon which traffic really moves they are lower than a rate-prorate plan would fix ... . It is our judgment upon the facts presented that such a rate-prorate basis may properly be used as a rough test of fair divisions . It will not always operate fairly , for one factor or the other may be out of line . Thus the rate between the interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrier on traffic moved all rail by the same gateway can be shown to be excessive , it will ordinarily be excessive when applied to rail-and-barge traffic . But aside from this , it does not necessarily follow that if the all-rail division is fair , it is under all circumstances a fair division for rail-and-barge traffic .... While the law does not permit us to require rail carriers to establish through routes which result in the short-hauling of one carrier which has a reasonably direct route of its own , it is , perhaps , not a necessary conclusion , when such routes and joint rates are established , that local rates are fair divisions for the carrier which is short-hauled . However , the law now authorizes us to require the establishment of through rail-and-water routes and joint rates which short-haul a rail carrier , and the reasons are evident . If a water route were dependent for feeders upon rail lines which can deliver traffic to it without short-hauling themselves , it would draw little traffic from the interior except at ports , like St. Louis , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different territories . Carrying this thought to its logical conclusion , if the rail lines of the country were owned by a great many independent companies , the water route would have a liberal supply of feeders ; but if the rail lines were all one consolidated system , it would be wholly deprived of feeders . Yet its status as a useful and economical means of transportation would be the same in the one event as in the other . Clearly the usefulness of water routes to interior points ought not to be dependent upon the extent to which rail lines are consolidated , and Congress has wisely recognized this in the law . It follows , whatever may be the case as between rail lines , that joint rates over rail-and-water routes ought to be divided without regard to the extent to which rail carriers may be short-hauled , and not upon a plan designed to discourage or render impracticable the use of such joint rates . The record shows that the exaction by rail lines of their local rates as divisions under such circumstances has for its admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , it is a means of accomplishing indirectly what Congress , in the law respecting the establishment of through routes and joint rates , has sought to prevent . Nor do we believe that the rail lines will in the long run suffer in such situations from more liberal divisions to water carriers . . . . And this leads to consideration of the character and purpose of joint rates .
