At the end of August , U. S. recovery seemed in full marching order . The stockmarket , after a healthy reaction from the whopping June and July rise , appeared on the verge of breaking into new high ground . Factory employment gained 4.9% ( 1.5% is the normal August increase ) . And commercial loans , having sagged all through Depression II , completed in New York City three weeks of solid rise . Since then , however , European militarism has gradually got into full marching order . By last week , instead of marching , U. S. business was generally marking time , with only a few industries pushing ahead like scouts reconnoitring in enemy territory . <P> The timidity of business as a whole appeared best in two broad indices , the stockmarket and the volume of commercial loans . Last week the market rebounded vigorously on the news that Czechoslovakia would give in to Hitler . In two days the Dow-Jones industrial averages jumped from 134.1 to 139.2 . Then came the breakdown in negotiations , and traders pulled in their necks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumping hit the San Francisco Exchange with a rush . <P> Federal Reserve member banks outside of New York City reported the trend of commercial loans was still up . But in New York , where Big Business does most of its borrowing , they dropped for the fourth week in succession , a $33,000,000 decline erasing all but $4,000,000 of the August rise . <P> But in some directions business continued its recovery march . Best example was the greatly depressed automotive industry . With the Automobile Show only a month away , automobile production for the first time this year passed the 1937 level-25,554 units last week , compared to 23,222 year ago . Power output stood at a new high since November , only 2.9% under a year ago . Lumber output rose contra-seasonally and commodity prices , whose break in March 1937 first heralded Depression II , continued a rise that has been steady since early August . <P> Meanwhile there was but little slackening in the flight of gold to the U. S. , leading the New York Times to express a prime worry of monetary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible , of course , to sterilize the presence of gold , to keep it from forcing prices upward . . . . But nobody ever has found a way to sterilize the absence of gold . When a country i. e. , in Europe has too little of the metal , its prices fall , bringing depression . <P> To relieve the depression it lowers the gold value of its currency . In its own currency , its prices may seem higher , but in gold , the international currency , they drop , exerting pressure on the international price structure . . . . The world has seen it happen again and again . "
