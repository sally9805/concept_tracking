" Because of the tremendous crops , nothing can stop business improvement this fall . " When famed Economist Roger Babson spoke thus before the Boston Chamber of Commerce last week , he enunciated what is currently the No. 1 bullish hope of the country . In theory bumper crops sold at fair prices provide the huge farming class with such extensive buying power that all commerce benefits . How bumper are crops was last week summarized by revised estimates of the Department of Agriculture , indicating that total value for three major crops of corn , wheat and cotton will be $4,500,000,000 , largest since 1930 . Total farm income from the sale of all crops plus payments by the Agricultural Adjustment Administration will total up to nearly $9,000,000,000. largest since 1929 's $10,479,000,000 , and more than a billion greater than last year . Though bears suggested that most of this fat income had already been spent in anticipatory or installment buying , leaving only a wrung-out remnant for fall business , joy reigned in most rural hearts as the nine billion dollar harvest moon approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's corn crop is 2,549,000,000 bu. - 109,000,000 bu. less than estimated a month ago but a billion more than last year . At present prices of 63 a bushel for December corn in Chicago , the crop is worth about $1,606,000,000 . Last week , with this huge harvest due to begin pouring on the market about Oct. 1 , by a freak of commerce the corn futures market on the Chicago Board of Trade was threatened by the tightest " natural squeeze " or corn shortage in years . This was due to the fact that last year 's short crop left the smallest carryover of this century . As a result , corn brokers anticipated trouble fulfilling their contracts for September futures which come due on Sept. 30 , before the new crop reaches market . There were only some 4,000,000 bu. of visible supply for September delivery . Prices soared as high as $1.16 a bushel , longs grinned , shorts hunted frenziedly for stray kernels . <P> A similar situation occurred last July when potent Cargill Grain Co. held the long interest , and potent Farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute Farmers suddenly pulled 500,000 bu. of previously invisible corn out of the hat , gave Cargill a severe drubbing as the price fell 27 . Last week brokers suspected that Cargill was out to get even . However , there was little chance that a serious squeeze would materialize , for the Secretary of Agriculture has power to extend trading to prevent such things . Last week the Commodity Exchange Administration was visibly disturbed , uttered warnings about manipulation and presently the Chicago Board of Trade Clearing House Association doubled the margins on September corn ( from 4 to 8 ) to discourage new speculation . At week 's end longs reluctantly liquidated enough corn to ease the squeeze materially .
