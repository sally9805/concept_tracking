Last week Franklin Roosevelt cleared his desk by vetoing the last four bills , all minor , left behind by the 74th Congress , * set off on a month of travels . First lap was a jaunt through Virginia , ending in Washington this week . Later in the week the President planned to turn north , help dedicate New York City 's great Triborough Bridge , continue on to Hyde Park for a few days ' rest and the annual celebration of the Roosevelt Home Club . <P> Thence he would put to sea , repeating the lucky pattern of 1932 , and cruise up the coast to Campobello Island on a 45-ft. schooner named Sewanna , lately rented by Son James . On July 31 the President planned to have his long-delayed visit with Canada 's Governor General , Lord Tweedsmuir , in Quebec . <P> Washington was grey with rain one morning last week as the Presidential party , including Mrs. Roosevelt , Postmaster General Farley and Secretary Ickes , rolled south by automobile over the magnificent Skyline Drive which skirts Blue Ridge hilltops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skies had cleared . <P> The tourists stopped on a ridge overlooking Civil War battlegrounds , opened picnic hampers , munched while the President , with a cold chicken drumstick for a pointer , discoursed on the tactics of Stonewall Jackson and Phil Sheridan . After lunch he moved on to Big Meadows . Va . and the first chore of his trip , a speech dedicating Shenandoah National Park . <P> Planned by Secretary of the Interior Hubert Work in 1924 , approved by Congress in 1926. created last December by Virginia 's gift of 176,000 acres of scenic woodland , and provided with roads , paths and clearings by the Civilian Conservation Corps , Shenandoah will eventually be linked by a 500-mile national parkway to Big Smokies National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee . <P> Last week , standing before 5,000 auditors on a grassy plateau , his amplified voice echoing down through the valley . President Roosevelt rang the changes on one of his favorite themes- Conservation-and issued a stout defense of one of his favorite New Deal agencies- the CCC . <P> " The creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one part of our great program of husbandry- the joint husbandry of our human resources and our national resources . . The product of the labor of the men of the Civilian Conservation Corps ... is as significant as though instead of working for the Government they had worked in a mill or factory . . . . Our country will need many other young men as they come to manhood for work like this-for other Shenandoahs . <P> " Is it a dream-will I perhaps be accused of an exaggerated passion for planning if I paint for you a picture ? ... In almost every other part of the country there is a similar need for recreational areas . . . roadside camps . . . smell of the woods . . . wind in the trees . . . men and women who every morning and every night can lift up their eyes to Mother Nature . ... " Next day was Independence Day and the President had appropriately chosen as his second goal the home of the Declaration 's author . Disappointed were those who expected Franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he did in unmistakable terms at Washington 's Jackson Day dinner last winter ( TIME . Jan. 20 ) .
