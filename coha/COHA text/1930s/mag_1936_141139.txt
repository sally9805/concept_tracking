Three eminent Democrats held a premature political convention of their own last week in the letters columns of the New York Times , where they were certain of getting a wider audience than they could enjoy at Philadelphia week after next . Naming no slate , they nevertheless drew up an epistolary platform which contained , among other originalities , the declaration that the " national policy followed by this Administration ... is profoundly reactionary . " The signatories to these sentiments were Woodrow Wilson 's Wartime Secretary of War Newton Diehl Baker , Franklin Roosevelt 's first Budget Director Lewis William Douglas and Leo Wolman , who served on Wilson 's War Industries Board and on Roosevelt 's first National Labor Board . <P> " We believe , " continued this talented trio of ex-public servants , " that the time has come to challenge the policies which , under the twelve years of Republican rule , fostered the growth of private monopolies and subsidized them by exclusive privileges of tariff protection . We challenge those policies which under three years of Democratic rule aimed to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to create new private monopolies based on more legal privileges and subsidies . . . . <P> " We can not subscribe to the view that the monopolistic tendencies which had official sanction from 1920 to 1932 were conducive to prosperity , and we can not subscribe to the view of those New Dealers who claim that their experiments in monopoly , restriction and centralized political power are in the interests of an abundant life . . . . <P> " The evils of bureaucracy , centralization and extravagant expenditures are a popular reaction to the evils of private privilege . They are defensive and complementary . They are fire used to fight fire , they are abuses of public power resulting from abuses of private power , and only those who are prepared to deal with the causes can hope to deal with the consequences . " <P> As remedy , four policies were proposed : 1 ) " step by step " withdrawal of all special privileges in order to restore free competition ; 2 ) removal of legislative power from administrators to Congress , from Congress to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " making taxes direct and visible ; 4 ) forcing the Government as well as citizens to obey the law . <P> Though Messrs . Baker , Douglas &; Wolman had chosen the burden of their platform from the current and historic tenets of both major parties , it was soon evident they had pleased neither . No Republican leader spoke up to praise them . On behalf of the Administration , Senator Minton of Indiana sneered : " My idea of a platform would be one to repudiate Newton Baker rather than the New Deal . "
