THE " Collected Poems " of Mark Van Doren show j that the poet 's manner was formed as soon as he had found his material . The manner is remarkable in that , almost alone among his contemporaries in this country , Mr. Van Doren shows no trace of French influence . He is in the English tradition ; his master , we can hardly doubt it , Dryden . He has the ease of Dryden , as he has the sanity ; though he has always clarity he does not have a comparable radiance . He has his own grace , but does not give that sense of inexhaustible strength which , more than anything else in Dryden , contributes to the impression of manly nobility . Mr Van Doren is more easily resigned . He has come late to the English tradition , as he is rather belated in coming to his particular New English material . The style he has made for it is properly autumnal and dry . But if we should by any chance be about to complain that it has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover , under the dry rustle of the long leaves , the authentic golden grain . Mark Van Doren is extremely prolific ; and yet his poetry is presented , amid his verse , with a sparse hand . Nevertheless it is always there . The enormous influence of the French poets of the nineteenth century on contemporary American poetry is easily accounted for if we remember that these poets were the first December 23 , 1939 to explore the effects on the sensibility of a civilization in which , with each decade , industry played more and more the predominant part . It can not be too often said that what the Symbolist poets sought was not an escape from the life of their times . What they sought was life ; they could only report where it failed . The poetic means which they created to that end corresponded to the exasperation of nerves which accompanied the hunt , the distraction of the mind , the extremity of the heart that came with its failure . There was not one of the great Symbolist poets who might not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his aim was to write of his race and of reality . That , it is true , is also Mr. Van Doren 's intention . It is significant that in adhering to the English tradition , which he has adapted to the uses of a modern sensibility with no small skill , he has been constrained to take as his peculiar province a place where industrialism has not apparently penetrated . It has , of course ; only in that portion of Connecticut that is Mr. Van Doren 's poetic property , it does not look like industrialism . It looks like death . And yet , having made his choice , how honestly Mark Van Doren has held by it ! He is a completely integrated person in an age when all we have known disintegrates . He seems while young to have become accustomed to the fact that.his own particular world was already lost . And these things make him not altogether of our time . He is not solitary , but remote . The region into which he takes us is one where " Time smiles at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the New England air and like it is both harsh and delicate . And like that atmosphere it lends itself continually to fine perceptions ; it has its own clarity , which may perhaps conceal , as the district it celebrates , how intricate its thought really is . Mr. Van Doren 's corner of Connecticut may now appear old , harmless , and mad . It was not always so . For New England is more than a section of the country ; it is a peculiar spiritual climate . And it may well be that they will weather it best who , like Mr. Van Doren , were born and nurtured in the Middle West . The native New Englander , if he happens to be a poet , will probably revolt like Cummings against Concord , Cambridge , and all their works . He will escape as rapidly as possible and yet continue to breathe , with full lungs , upon its furthest confines of air . The Middle West was settled by New Englanders who sought less inclement elements and hoped to find an earth not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spiritual culture , and the Middle West has no other . It is a soulless region . The Middle Westerner must either be content to get along without a soul and record , as Hemingway has done , all the circumstance of living without an inner life , or he must look elsewhere . It may be that he will return , as Mark Van Doren has done , to New England . The old landscape is still there . Much in Connecticut is permanent . And yet it is a land that men have abandoned . The poet looks at what was once a farm to see a fallen barn whose timbers the rain will soon sink into sod . Nothing remains Of what it was that made these beams a barn . This country around West Cornwall was where a man once could say : 715 I can go home . I can be my own master . I 've got a house now , a little patch of corn , A plow , and a shed , and a one-eyed mule ; As ignorant and poor as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own pauper and I 'm my own fool . That was the self-reliance of the sixties . But that was long ago . Now , where there were such men , is No corn upon an aged trembling hand . To look for the genius of the place is to find , in a poem appropriately called " Spirit , " A straight old woman , tall and very pale , Moving from room to room of a musty house No voice is ever heard in . It is a land , not only abandoned by its men , but of men abandoned by their gods . ( Mr. Van Doren 's " American Mythology " is not about gods , but about folkways , which he calls by the names of gods . ) It is .. a land of death and resignation to the approach of death by way of a dragged-out living , which is no longer desperate and scarcely tragic , which is , in fact , no longer much of anything . That Mr. Van Doren loves this land almost every page of his bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he finds in these hills somehow his proper surroundings . He makes them the landscape of his spirit . It is the land of his poetry . Out of it he has made much , for it is his by choice . He comes there to write his " Winter Diary , " and it is a charming account , in most skilful couplets , of a cold season spent there with his family , playing at being snowbOund . For it is play . The snow that falls is real . But the 716 Van Dorens , not being farmers , not being cut off whenever they like from escape , only pretend to be confined by the long cold . But it is for them , as for the reader , a pleasant pretense . When so much has been given of New England , it seems ungrateful to ask for more . But what is lacking here is something that went out of the region long ago and whose loss was set down with incomparable intensity by another poet who was completely aware of what had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If nothing larger than a World 's Departure from a hinge , ) Or Sun 's extinction be observed ' T was not so large that I Could lift my forehead from my work For curiosity . That is the authentic New England note , not self-reliance , which before and after Emerson could be carried away , but the soul sufficient to itself . That is the note . But we can scarcely blame Mr. Van Doren that he has come too late into the country to hear it . For none since Emily Dickinson has heard it . It is no longer there . The capacity for tragic action , which is continually present in Emily Dickinson 's verse , is gone . And the strain of loss is over . What is left has assured Mark Van Doren a singular tranquillity and enabled him to write his elegies of New England . JOHN PEALE BISHOP Handbook for Boat-Owners SEAMANSHIP BELOW ' DECK . By Ruth Brindze . Harcourt , Brace and Company . $2.50 . I N THE past two years yachtbuilders by force of neces- sity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexpensive cruising boats to meet the pocket of the sea-minded moderate-income group . The success of these boats in the past season , from the Chesapeake Bay to Maine , has resulted in substantial additions to the sailing fraternity . To the many newcomers in this group , both captains and first mates , I suggest Miss Brindze 's book as a Christmas present ; it will be an excellent starting-point for discussion on winter evenings , when the boat is up on dry-dock but not far from the captain 's mind . The author has evidently done more than her share of sailing , and writes with authority on the inner functionings of a ship . The care of galley and cabin while at sea and the choice of articles to be carried are excellently handled . The problems of lighting a small ship adequately are well stated and solved . Notes on winter care are exceptionally timely and correct . The book is also a mine of information on dothing for on and off watch , time-tables , weather-bureau reports , cooking suggestions  --  all thoroughly indexed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictaphone handy for quite a few years , and stirred up many a discussion with old salts . To those who know the joys of the sea , here is a book to be read with much pleasure . For the neophyte , it furnishes a large-scale chart of the numerous rocks and reefs that threaten the comfort , if not the safety , of life on the water . HUGH H. DARBY The NATION
