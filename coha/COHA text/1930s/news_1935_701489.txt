txt Non-Reflecting Shop Windows . The non-reflecting window for shop fronts , a curved glass , described in THE TIMES , is not an entire novelty , for the principle was first applied in this city many years ago . It was tried by a department store then in Twenty-third Street , but not permanently adopted . It appears fully to answer its purpose , nonreflection of the window shopper and a clear view of the goods . The new window should promptly displace the white and other light-colored backgrounds which the shops were induced to substitute a few years ago in place of the handsome and effective backgrounds of mahogany , rosewood and walnut . Against these backgrounds the goods displayed stood out with distinction , while against the light background they melt and disappear , the eye distracted by the glare and not focusing to advantage on the display . FREDERICK PHILLIPS . New York , Sept. 30 , 1935.
