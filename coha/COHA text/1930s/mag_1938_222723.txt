I 'm the toast of Vienna , And most of Vienna Can boast It 's been host To the toast of Vienna . <P> This little ditty , sung in At Home Abroad by Beatrice Lillie in 1935 , might well have been sung in earnest by Countess Vera Fugger von Babenhausen any time before the Nazification of Austria . Besides having Kurt von Schuschnigg as fiance , she had as fancy a pair of slanting eyes and as sensitive a pair of musical ears as any blonde in the city . She was 33 , a moderately gay divorcee , an intelligent conversationalist-and consequently popular . <P> But since the Nazi coup , the Countess has had only one quiet amusement-chatting with the former Chancellor while he was " honorably detained " in the Belvedere Palace . One of the things they talked about was getting married . They had been thinking about it for some time , but Chancellor Schuschnigg , a devout Roman Catholic , could not marry a divorced woman . Last December , the Vatican came to their aid by annulling the Countess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church asked the Chancellor not to marry as long as he was in power . With Anschluss , the Nazis opened up the hymenal way but shut up the former Chancellor . <P> Last week , day before the bride 's birthday , the couple were married . Kurt Schuschnigg was unable to attend his own wedding , for though he had been escorted away from Belvedere , he was being held for questioning in Vienna 's former Hotel Metropole , now Nazi secret political police headquarters . By special mandate his brother , Dr. Arthur Schuschnigg , former director of the Austrian Federal Broadcasting Co. , went in for him at the altar . The Countess , holding a bouquet of yellow roses sent by her absentee groom , was solemnly married to the proxy , then broke open a note from the real thing : By this time we should be man and wife . This makes me extremely happy . A thousand kisses . Kurt . <P> After the ceremony , Countess Schuschnigg told friends that the days of toasts were over . She and her husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks , she had moved her trunks and household chattels in a taxi to their new , modest , downtown apartment . When she would be joined there by her husband , only the Gestapo knew .
