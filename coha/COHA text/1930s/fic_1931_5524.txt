Illustration : I looked into the face of a girl about to be bled . The Heads of Apex By Francis Flagg * * * * * Sidenote : Far under the sea-floor Solino 's submarine carries two American soldiers of fortune to startling adventure among the Vampire Heads of Apex . Justus Miles was sitting on a bench in the park , down at the heels , hungry , desperate , when a gust of wind whirled a paper to his feet . It was the advertising section of the New York Times . Apathetically , he picked it up , knowing from the past weeks ' experience that few or no jobs were being advertised . Then with a start he sat up , for in the center of the page , encased in a small box and printed in slightly larger type than the ordinary advertisement , he read the following words : " Wanted : Soldier of Fortune , young , healthy ; must have good credentials . Apply 222 Reuter Place , between two and four . " It was to-day 's advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Reuter Place was some distance away , he knew , a good hour 's walk on hard pavement and through considerable heat . But he had made forced marches in Sonora as badly shod and on even an emptier stomach . For Justus Miles , though he might not have looked it , was a bona fide soldier of fortune , stranded in New York . Five feet eight in height , he was , loose and rangy in build , and with deceptively mild blue eyes . He had fought through the World War , served under Kemal Pasha in Turkey , helped the Riffs in Morocco , filibustered in South America and handled a machine-gun for revolutionary forces in Mexico . Surely , he thought grimly , if anyone could fill the bill for a soldier of fortune it was himself . 222 Reuter Place proved to be a large residence in a shabby neighborhood . On the sidewalk , a queue of men was being held in line by a burly cop . The door of the house opened , and an individual , broad-shouldered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instantly Justus Miles let out a yell , " Rusty ! By God , Rusty ! " and waved his hands . " Hey , feller , who do you think you 're shovin ' ? " growled a hard-looking fellow at the head of the line , but Justus Miles paid no attention to him . The man in the doorway also let out an excited yell . " Well , well , if it is n't the Kid ! Hey , Officer , let that fellow through : I want to speak to him . " * * * * * With the door shut on the blasphemous mob , the two men wrung each other 's hands . Ex-Sergeant Harry Ward , known to his intimates as " Rusty , " led Justus Miles into a large office and shoved him into a chair . " I did n't know you were in New York , kid . The last I saw of you was when we quit Sandino . " " And I never suspected that 222 Reuter Place would be you , Rusty . What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to connect ? " " You bet your life there 's a chance . Three hundred a month and found . But the boss has the final say-so , though I 'm sure he 'll take you on my recommendation . " He opened a door , led Justus Miles through an inner room , knocked at a far door and ushered him into the presence of a man who sat behind a roll-topped desk . There was something odd about this old man , and after a moment 's inspection Justus Miles saw what it was . He was evidently a cripple , propped up in a strange wheelchair . He had an abnormally large and hairless head , and his body was muffled to the throat in a voluminous cloak , the folds of which fell over and enveloped most of the wheelchair itself . The face of this old gentleman -- though the features were finely molded -- was swarthy : its color was almost that of a negro -- or an Egyptian . He regarded the two men with large and peculiarly colored eyes -- eyes that probed them sharply . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you advertised for , Mr. Solino. " * * * * * Solino regarded Justus Miles critically . " You have been a soldier of fortune ? " he asked . He spoke English with the preciseness of an educated foreigner . " Yes , sir . Rusty -- that is , Mr. Ward knows my record . " " I was his sergeant in France , sir ; saw fighting with him in Morocco , Turkey , Nicaragua --  " " You can vouch for him , then ; his character , courage --  " " You could n't get a better man , sir . If I had known he was in town I would have sent for him . " " Very well ; that is sufficient . But Mr. -- Miles did you say ?  - -  understands he is embarking on a dangerous adventure with grave chances of losing his life ? " " I have faced danger and risked my life before this , " said Justus Miles quietly . The other nodded . " Then that is all I am prepared to tell you at this time . " Justus Miles accompanied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a change of clothing . It was luxurious to splash in warm water and bath-salts after the enforced griminess of weeks . The clothes fitted him fairly well , the two men being of a size . Lounging in his friend 's room after a substantial meal , and smoking a Turkish cigarette , he questioned Ward more closely . " Who is the old fellow ? " " I do n't know . He hired me through an advertisement and then set me to employing others . " " But surely you know where we are going ? " " Hardly more than you do . Solino did say there was a country , a city to be invaded . Whereabouts is a secret . I ca n't say I care for going it blind , but neither do I like starving to death . I was in about the same shape you were when you applied . Desperate . " Justus Miles stretched himself comfortably . " A spiggoty by the looks of him , " he said ; " negro blood , no doubt . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting than sit on a park bench . I suppose the old boy will tell us more in good time , and until then we 're sitting pretty , with good eats to be had ; so why worry ? " And yet if Justus Miles had been able to look ahead he might not have talked so blithely. * * * * * During the week that followed his employment , he saw nothing of Solino , though Ward met the old man for a few moments every day to receive his instructions . " It puzzles me , " he confessed to Miles , " how the old chap lives . There 's a private exit to the street from his rooms , but I could swear he never goes out . How could he in that wheelchair -- no attendant . And yet he must . How would he get food ? " Justus Miles smiled lazily . " No mystery at all , Rusty . We 're gone for hours at a time . What 's to prevent him from phoning to have his meals brought in ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say --  " " Good Lord !  - -  is there only one restaurant in Manhattan ? " Yet Justus Miles himself could not help feeling there was something mysterious about Solino , but just how mysterious he did not realize -- until , one evening , he stood with a half dozen of his fellow adventurers in a lonely spot on the Long Island coast and watched the darkness deepen around them . " We shall wait , " said Solino presently , " until the moon comes up . " The moon rose at about nine o'clock , flooding the beach and the heaving expanse of water with a ghostly light . From the folds of Solino 's cloak , close about his muffled throat , a peculiar ray of green light flashed out over the water . In answer , a green light flashed back , and presently , something low and black , like the body of a whale half submerged , stole towards the beach . Scarcely a ripple marked its progress , and the nose of it slid up on the sand . " Good Lord ! " whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a submarine ! " But the craft on which the surprised soldiers of fortune gazed was not an ordinary submarine . In the first place , there was no conning tower ; and , in the second , from the blunt nose projected a narrow gangway bridging the few feet of water between the mysterious craft and the dry beach . But the men had little time to indulge in amazement . " Quick , " said Solino ; " load those boxes onto the gangway . No need to carry them further . " He himself wheeled his chair into the interior of the submarine , calling back , " Hurry , hurry ! " * * * * * The adventurers accomplished the loading in a few minutes . " Now , " came the voice of their employer , " stand on the gangway yourselves . Steady ; do n't move . " Under their feet they felt the gangway vibrate and withdraw from the land . For a moment they were in utter darkness ; then a light flashed up and revealed a long , box-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed , leaving no sign of its existence . In the center of the room stood a mechanism like a huge gyroscope , and a plunging piston , smooth and black , went up and down with frictionless ease . In front of what was evidently a control board sat a swarthy man with a large hairless head and peculiarly colored eyes . The adventurers stared in surprise , for this man , too , sat in a wheelchair , seemingly a cripple ; but unlike Mr. Solino he wore no cloak , his body from the neck down being enclosed in a tubular metal container . The body must have been very small , and the legs amputated at the hips , since the container was not large and terminated on the seat of the peculiar wheel chair to which it seemed firmly attached . Solino did not offer to introduce them to the man at the control board , who , aside from a quick look , paid them no attention . He ushered them ahead into another , though smaller cabin , and after indicating certain arrangements made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the floor under their feet and the perceptible vibration of the craft , the adventurers knew they were under way . " Well , this is a rum affair and no mistake about it , " said one of them . " A freak -- a bloomin ' freak , " remarked another whose cockney accent proclaimed the Englishman . " Yuh 're shore right , " said a lean Texan . " That hombre out there had no legs . " " Nor hands either . " Miles and Ward glanced at one another . The same thought was in both minds . Neither of them had ever seen Mr. Solino 's hands . A rum affair all right ! * * * * * Hours passed . Some of the men fell to gambling . At intervals they ate . Twice they turned in and slept . Then , after what seemed an interminable time , Solino summoned Miles and Ward to his presence in the control room . " It is time , " he said , " that you should know more of the enterprise on which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other men . A year 's salary for all of you lies to your credit at the Chase Bank of New York . And this money will not be your sole reward if you survive and serve faithfully . " " Thank you , sir , " said Ward ; " but now that we are well on our way to our destination , could you not tell us more about it ? You have said something of a city , a country . Where is that country ? " " Down , " was the astounding answer . " Down ? " echoed both men . " Yes , " said Solino slowly , " down . The gateway to that land is at the bottom of the ocean . " As the two men gaped at him , incredulous , an awful thing happened . With an appalling roar and a rending of steel and iron , the submarine halted abruptly in its headlong flight , reared upward at an acute angle and then fell forward with a tremendous crash . The adventurers were thrown violently against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * * * How long they lay there insensible they never knew . Justus Miles was the first to come to , and he found himself in Stygian blackness . " Rusty ! " he called , feeling terribly sick and giddy . Only silence answered him . " Good God ! " he thought , " what has happened ? " His hand went out and recoiled from something soft and sticky . Gingerly he sat up . There was a lump on his head . His body felt bruised and sore but it was evidently sound . He recollected the small but powerful flashlight in his pocket , and drew it forth and pressed the button . A reassuring pencil of light pierced through the gloom . Even as it did so , someone groaned , and Ward 's voice uttered his name . " Is that you , Kid ? " " It 's me , all right . " " You ai n't hurt ? " " Nothing to speak of . How about you ? " " O. K. , I guess . An awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . " Ward 's face appeared in the ray of light , pale and blood-streaked . " I wonder what happened . " " It sounded like a collision . " They stared at one another with fearful eyes . A collision while underseas in a submarine is a serious matter . " Where 's Solino ? " Justus Miles ran the beam of his torch this way and that , and saw that the room was in a fearful confusion . The gyroscopic mechanism had broken from its fastenings and rolled forward . Somewhere beneath its crushing weight lay the control board and the swarthy operator . Then they saw Solino , still in his overturned wheelchair , the cloak drawn tightly about himself and it ; but the top of his head was crushed in like an eggshell . Justus Miles had touched that head when he stretched out his hand in the darkness . He and Ward had been saved from death as by a miracle . Over their heads the great piston had hurtled , killing Solino and tearing through the steel partition into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One hasty examination of that place was enough . The men in there were dead . * * * * * Sick with horror , the two survivors faced the stark reality of their terrible plight . Trapped in an underwater craft , they saw themselves doomed to perish even more miserably than their companions . As the horrible thought sank home , a cool breath of air , suggesting the smell of stagnant salt water , blew through an opening created by the crushing of the plates in the vessel 's hull -- an opening larger than the body of a man . Miles and Ward stared at it with puzzled eyes . With such a hole in her hull , the boat should have been admitting water and not air . However , they approached the gap and examined it with their torches . " Here goes , " Ward said after a moment 's hesitation , and clambered through the opening , followed by his friend . When they were able to make out their surroundings , they saw that they were in a vast tunnel or cavern , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submarine had left the ocean and penetrated to this cavern it was impossible to say ; but evidently it had come so far over a shining rail , a break in which had caused the disaster . The cavern or tunnel was paved with disjointed blocks of stone which once might have been smooth and even , but which now were disarranged by time and slimy with dampness and seagrowths . In the clammy air Miles involuntarily shuddered . " Good Lord , Rusty , we 're certainly up against it ! The only fellow who could tell us our whereabouts is dead ! " Ward 's jaw tightened . " That rail leads somewhere : it 's our only hope . But first let us get our guns and some food . " * * * * * They were fortunate enough to discover several thermos bottles unbroken . Hot coffee revived their fainting spirits . Treating their bruises and cuts as well as they could , they left the submarine or car -- it seemed to have been convertible for use either in water or on rail -- and trudged ahead . Beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched away into illimitable blackness . Over rough stones , stumbling into shallow pools of water , the light of their torches serving but faintly to show the depressing surroundings , the two men plunged . Neither of them was without fear , but both possessed the enduring courage of men habituated to facing danger and sudden death without losing control of their faculties . Time passed , but they had no means of telling how much , since their wrist watches no longer functioned . But after a while they noticed that the grade was upward and the going easier . At the same moment , Ward called attention to the fact that , even without electric torches , it was possible to see . All around the two Americans grew a strange light -- a weird , phosphorescent glow , revealing far walls and massive pillars . Now they could see that they were in a vast chamber , undoubtedly the work of human hands ; a room awe-inspiring to behold , and even more than awe-inspiring in the reflections it forced upon their minds . Passages radiated on either hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectral light . Justus Miles gave a low cry of amazement when a closer investigation revealed those bulks to be the wrecks of mighty and intricate machines , the use of which it was vain to conjecture . He looked at Ward . " Solino spoke of a city down in the ocean . Can this be it ? " Ward shook his head . " Everything here is old , abandoned . Look -- what is that ? " * * * * * The figure of a giant creature , carved either from stone or marble and encrusted with phosphorous , stood lowering in their path . It was that of a winged beast with a human head . Its features were negroid in character ; and so malignant was the expression of the staring face , so lifelike the execution of the whole statue , that a chill of fear ran through their veins . It was in Ward 's mind that this gigantic carving was akin to the ones he had seen in Egypt , and as old , if not older . Beyond the statue the rail curved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were amazed to come upon a sort of " yard " where the rail stopped . In that enclosure , on several sidings , were submarine cars similar to the wrecked one they had abandoned . But that was not the sight which brought them to a breathless halt . Beyond the sidings stood what appeared to be a small building of gleaming crystal . After a moment of breathless wonder they cautiously approached the bizarre structure . No dampness or phosphorus impaired the clarity of its walls . The material composing them felt vibrantly warm to the touch . It was not glass , yet it was possible to look without difficulty into the interior of the building , which appeared to be one large room containing nothing but a central device not unlike the filaments of an electric bulb . In fact , the whole building , viewed from the outside , reminded the two adventurers of a giant light globe . The filaments radiated a steady and somehow exhilarating light . The door -- they knew it was a door because an edging of dark metal outlined its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " questioned Miles ; and Ward answered doubtfully , " I do n't know . Perhaps .... " But at last they turned the golden knob , felt the door give to their pressure , and stepped through the entrance into the soft radiance of the interior . Unthinkingly , Ward released his hold on the knob and the door swung shut behind them . Instantly there was a flash of light , and they were oppressed by a feeling of nausea : and then , out of a momentary pit of blackness , they emerged to find that the room of crystal had oddly changed its proportions and opaqueness . " Quick ! " cried Ward ; " let us get out of this place . " Both men found the door and staggered forth . Then , at sight of what they saw , they stood rooted to the spot in sheer amazement . The gloomy tunnel and the sidings of submarine cars had vanished , and they were standing in a vast hall , an utterly strange and magnificent hall , staring up into the face of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * The green man was almost of heroic proportions ; he was clad in but a breech-clout , and was so broad as to appear squat in stature . He carried a short club , and appeared almost as dumbfounded as the two Americans . A moment he regarded them , then , with a ferocious snarl of rage , he hurled himself upon the startled Ward and half clubbed , half pushed him to the floor . Recovering from his momentary inaction and realizing the danger in which his friend stood , Miles shouted and leaped upon the green man 's back , fastening his sinewy fingers about the giant 's throat . But the latter was possessed of incredible strength , and , straightening up , he shook off Miles as a bear might shake off an attacking dog , and threw him heavily to the floor . Then the green giant whirled up his club , and it would have gone hardly with Miles if Ward had not remembered his automatic and fired in the nick of time . As if poleaxed , the green man fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look out ! " shouted Ward . Through a wide entrance came charging a dozen greenish giants . Miles fired both his pistols . The leader of the greenish men paused in mid-leap , clawing at his stomach . " This way , Kid ! " yelled Ward ; " this way ! " Taking advantage of the confusion in the ranks of the attackers , the two sprang to where an exit in the far wall promised an avenue of escape . Down a broad passage they rushed . Seemingly the passage ended in a cul-de-sac , for a wall of blank whiteness barred further progress . Behind them came charging the greenish giants uttering appalling cries . Desperately the two Americans turned , resolved to sell their lives as dearly as possible ; but at that moment happened a sheer miracle . The blank wall divided , revealing a narrow crevice through which they sprang . Noiselessly the crevice closed behind them , shutting out the green pursuers , and a voice said -- a voice in precise but strangely accented English : " We have been expecting you , gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Never would Miles and Ward forget the amazement of that moment . They were in a place which looked not unlike a huge laboratory . Then they saw it was a lofty room containing a variety of strange mechanisms . But it was not on these their eyes focussed . Confronting them in odd wheelchairs , with hairless heads projecting from tubular containers like the one they had seen encasing the man at the control board of the submarines , were all of half a hundred crippled men ! " Good Lord ! " exclaimed Miles , " I must be seeing things ! " " Where is Solino ? " demanded the voice in strangely accented English . Ward saw that the question came from an individual in a wheelchair a few feet in front of them . " Solino is dead , " he answered . " Dead ? " A ripple of sound came from the oddly seated men . " Yes , the submarine car was wrecked in the tunnel , and everyone aboard was killed save us two . " The hairless men looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said one of them , still in English ; and another said , " Yes , Spiro has done this . " Miles and Ward were recovering somewhat from their initial astonishment . " What place is this ? " asked the former . " This is Apex -- or , rather , the Palace of the Heads in Apex . " The Palace of the Heads ! The two Americans tried to control their bewilderment . " Pardon us if we do n't understand . Everything is so strange . First the submarine was wrecked . Then we entered the crystal room and the tunnel vanished . We ca n't understand how this place can be at the bottom of the Atlantic . " " It is n't at the bottom of the Atlantic . " " Not at the bottom ? Then where ? " " It is n't , " said the voice slowly , " in your world at all . " The import of what was said did not at first penetrate the minds of the Americans . " Not in our world ? " they echoed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling inscrutably , " you are tired and hungry . Later I shall explain more . " His strangely colored eyes bored into their own . " Sleep , " said his voice softly , imperatively ; and though they fought against the command with all the strength of their wills , heaviness weighted down their eyelids and they slept . * * * * * From dreamless sleep they awakened to find that fatigue had miraculously vanished , that their wounds were healed and their bodies and clothes were free of slime and filth . All but one of the crippled men -- for so in their own minds they termed the odd individuals -- had gone away . That one was the man who had first addressed them . " Do not be alarmed , " he said . " In our own fashion we have given you food and rest and attended to your comfort . " Ward smiled , though a trifle uncertainly . " We are not easily frightened , " he replied . " So ! That is good . But now listen : my name is Zoro and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago we Heads lived on a continent of your Earth now known to scholars as Atlantis . When Atlantis sank below the waves -- in your sacred book that tragedy is known as the Flood -- all but a scattered few of its people perished . I and my companions were among the survivors . " The Americans stared at him unbelievingly . " But that was a hundred thousand years ago ! " exclaimed Ward . " Three hundred thousand , " corrected Zoro . They stared at him dumbly . " Yes , " said Zoro ; " it sounds incredible to your ears , but it is true . Mighty as is the industrial civilization of your day , that of Atlantis was mightier . Of course , the country was n't then called Atlantis ; its real name was A-zooma . A-zooma ruled the world . Its ships with sails of copper and engines of brass covered the many seas which now are lands . Its airships clove the air with a safety and speed your own have still to attain . The wealth of the world poured into A-zooma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the enslaved masses of A-zooma and of conquered countries rose in great rebellions . Then against them marched the " iron baylas " breathing death and destruction , and from the air mighty ships poured down the yellow fog .... " Zoro paused , but presently went on : " So we ruled -- for ten thousand years ; until the scientists who begot those engines of destruction became afraid , because the serfs themselves began to build secret laboratories . We of the priesthood of science saw the inevitable disaster . Long ago we had put off our bodies --  " * * * * * Zoro smiled at the Americans ' amazement . " No , " he said , " I am not a cripple in a wheelchair . This tubular container holds no fleshly body . Inside of it is a mechanical heart which pumps artificial blood -- blood purified by a process I will not describe -- through my head . It also contains certain inner devices under my mental control , devices that take the place of human hands and feet . Only by accident or through lack of certain essentials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in awe . " You mean , " faltered Miles , " that save for your head you are all -- machine ? " " Practically , yes . We priest-scientists of the Inner Mystery prolonged life in such fashion . I was three thousand years old when -- But enough ! I will not weary you with a recital of how the slaves burrowed the bowels of A-zooma and of how the masters loosed against them the forces of the atom . Suffice it to say that on an island we built our vast system of buildings -- or tunnel as you choose to call it -- and sealed them away from the outside world , entrance being made by submarines through automatically controlled locks . " At about this time our experiments opened up another realm of existence , manifesting at a vibratory rate above that of earth . To this new realm we brought workers who built the City of Apex and the palace you are in . But , unfortunately , we brought with us no weapons of offense , and in the new world we had neither the material nor the delicate mechanisms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no rebellion on the part of the workers who , even in A-zooma , had worshipped us as gods . They were born , grew old and died , but we abode forever . Besides , in the City of Apex they were freer than they had ever been before , merely having to furnish our laboratories with certain raw materials and the wherewithal to sustain the blood supply on which our lives depend . But , of late , they have made common cause with the original inhabitants of this plane , the green men --  " * * * * * The green men ! As if the words were a signal , a dreadful thing happened . Out of a far shadow leaped a lean and hideous monster . To Miles ' startled eyes it seemed to grow as it leaped . Thin , unbelievably thin it was , yet swelling at the head . From between two goggle-eyes writhed a rope-like trunk . Twelve feet in the air its head towered over Zoro . " Look out ! " screamed the American . Zoro 's chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ container wrapped the snake-like trunk , plucking the wheelchair and its occupant from the floor and dangling them high in air . " Shoot ! " cried Zoro . Miles shot . His bullet ploughed through the unbelievably thin body and ricochetted from a pillar beyond . Ward fired with better effect . One of the goggle eyes spattered like glass . Under a fusillade of bullets the monster wilted , giving expression to a weird , shrill cry . Zoro dangled head downwards . To drop from such a height on his skull would probably be fatal . But the monster did not drop him . Instead , in its death agony , its grip tightened , and the Americans witnessed an incredible sight . Before their very eyes the monster began rapidly to shrink . Its tenuous body telescoped together , becoming thinner and thinner in the process , until on the floor there lay the lifeless body of a snake-like creature not more than six inches in length ! " Good Lord ! " breathed Miles . Zoro who had escaped unscathed from his perilous plight , regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * * " It is a tah-a-la , " he said , " and must have entered the room at the same time you did . The green men often capture and train them for hunting . When about to seize their prey their bodies have the power of enormously stretching . " Outwardly he seemed unaffected by the danger safely passed and waved away several of his fellows who had wheeled to the spot attracted by the noise of the pistols . The Americans were more shaken . " Perhaps , " said Ward , " there is danger of --  " " None , " replied Zoro . " I know there are no other tah-a-las inside these rooms , since it is the nature of these beasts to rush to each other 's aid when they scream . And as for outside attacks , the laboratories are insulated against any the insurgent workers can make . Their weapons are poor -- the green men use but clubs . No , it is not their attacks we fear but their refusal to furnish us with supplies . They worshipped us as gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rite . But now they doubt our divinity , and , since they no longer listen to or obey our decrees , we have no means of punishing them . Spiro is responsible for this . " " Spiro ? " questioned the two men . " He whom we raised to the dignity of godhead on the accidental death of Bah-koo , causing a deep sleep to fall upon him in the temple and grafting his head upon the mechanical body left by the latter . Twice before we had done this with citizens of Apex , and how were we to know that Spiro would resent it ? True , he was in love with Ah-eeda , but the physical passions of men die with the organisms that give them birth . For three years he dwelt with us in the laboratories , learning the wisdom of the Heads , and then , "  - -  Zoro 's face became forbidding --  " he denounced us to the people . Though there was more or less discontent , they would never have dared defy us save for him . He told them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were merely the heads of men like himself and would die if they refused to give us the wherewithal to renew blood . * * * * * " But this refusal of theirs is an evil thing , " he cried , looking at the Americans with his strangely colored eyes . " It violates the custom of ages , and strikes at the very roots of our existence . So we held council and sent two of our number to Earth after men and weapons to enforce our demands . For years we had watched Earth , seen its myriad civilizations rise and fall , studied the coming of America to power and importance . So it was to America that Solino went , by way of the tunnel that still exists under the Atlantic --  " " And hired us , " interrupted Ward , " and brought us to the tunnel in the submarine-car where we --  " " Stepped into the crystal chamber , " finished Zoro . " That chamber is a re-vibrating device of certain rays and chemicals . The shutting of the door closed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this plane integrated them again . " So they were not at the bottom of the ocean . They were -- stupendous thought -- living in a new world of matter ! " Spiro suspected our plans , " continued Zoro . " He isolated us in our laboratories , and , by means of a crystal tube , went through to the tunnel , tore up a section of track , and wrecked the submarine-car . But his act was only partially successful . You two escaped death ; you are here ; you are ready to keep faith and fight in our service . " " We are ready to fight , " assented Miles and Ward . The situation was certainly an unusual one , and one they did not clearly understand ; but theirs was the simple code of the mercenary soldier -- they would fight for whoever hired them , and be loyal as long as their wages were paid . " Then there is no time to lose , " exclaimed Zoro . " Already our blood grows thin . You must go back to the wrecked submarine and retrieve your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sending tube in the next compartment . " * * * * * They followed Zoro through lofty rooms filled with amber light until they came to one wherein were assembled the rest of the Heads . Zoro spoke to them swiftly in a strange , flowing tongue . Then he conducted the two Americans to a crystal chamber at the end of the room and bade them enter it . The vibrant light caressed their limbs . " When I close this door , " he said , " you will find yourselves back in the tunnel . Board one of the submarine-cars on the siding and proceed to the wreck . " He gave them detailed instructions how to operate the car . " Then get your weapons and return . Do you understand ? " They nodded . " The workers possess no arms the equal of machine-guns and bombs . They will be at your mercy . Remember that you are fighting for our lives and that , if you save them , your reward will be great . Fear nothing . " The door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a moment of swooning darkness , and then they were staring through transparent walls into the phosphorescent gloom of the underseas crypt . Suddenly , what they had recently undergone seemed the product of an illusion , a dream . Ward shook himself vigorously . " I guess it was real enough , " he said . " Let us see if the car works . " They ran out to the wreck and returned without trouble . The machine-gun was mounted for action and the gas-bombs slung over their shoulders in convenient bags . " All right , " said Miles tensely , " let us go . " Again they entered the crystal chamber ; again there was the flash of light and the sensation of falling into darkest space . Then , in a moment it seemed , they were stepping into the hall from which they had fled pursued by the green men -- only for the second time , to be confronted by a crowd of hostile giants . " Do n't fire , Kid ! " yelled Ward . " It 's no use to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the attack of tear-gas , the green men broke and fled . " After them , " panted Ward : " we 've got them on the run ! " * * * * * Thrilling to the lust of battle , the two Americans emerged into an open square . They had little time to note the odd buildings and strange statues . Coming towards them with leveled weapons , the nature of which they did not know , was a band of short men -- that is , short in comparison with the greenish giants . Behind this company appeared still another , and another . Tear-gas was useless to stop their onward rush . " All right , " yelled Miles , " it 's lead they want ! " The machine-gun spat a hail of bullets . Before the first withering blast the swarthy men recoiled in confusion . Then a second volley scattered them like chaff . Miles and Ward were conscious of no pity for the dead and wounded lying on the pavement of yellow stone . This was their profession , the stern business of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse sights , and in Nicaragua and Mexico . They swept destructively out of the square and into a long tree-lined avenue . This might be another world or dimension but its trees looked not unlike those of tropical America . In a short while the radiating streets were cleared of crowds and the cries of the mob died away . Miles and Ward paused in the shadow of an overhanging wall and wiped their faces . " That was quick work , all right , " said Ward ; and , even as he said it , the wall seemed to fall upon their unprotected heads and crush them into unconsciousness .... * * * * * Out of a sick darkness they came . At first they thought they were confronting Zoro . Then , as the mists of unconsciousness cleared from aching heads , they perceived that they were in a vast hall crowded with swarthy men in short tunics , and with greenish giants wearing nothing but breech-clouts and swinging short clubs . The fierce eyes of the greenish giants were upon them , and the vengeful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both to rend and tear was held in check by the dominant head emerging from a tubular container mounted upon a wheelchair . The Americans stared . This was not the head of Zoro . No ! " The head of Spiro , " thought Miles and Ward with sinking hearts . They had fallen into the power of the leader of the insurgent workers ! Spiro -- for it was indeed he -- regarded them with pitiless eyes . His English was slower and not as fluent as that of Zoro , and his words harder to understand . " You Americans , beings of another world , have come here at the bidding of the Heads to slay and kill for gold . " He paused . " I who for three years studied your country , learned its language , history , did not believe men of your race could be so vile . " He paused again , and Ward broke out hotly , " It is true that we came here to fight for gold , but who are you to speak of vileness ? Have you not turned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who raised you to their height ? Are you not leading a revolt of the workers which would deny them the means of sustaining life ? Are you not seeking to perpetrate -- murder ? " Spiro regarded him slowly . " Is it possible you are in ignorance of what those means are ? Listen , then , while I tell you the hideous truth . Since the dawn of our history , until the present moment , the Heads have maintained their lives by draining blood from the veins of thousands of Apexans yearly ! " The Americans ' faces whitened . " What do you mean ? " breathed Ward . " I mean that the artificial blood pumped by mechanical hearts through the brains of the Heads -- yes , and that is now being pumped through my own ! " cried Spiro bitterly --  " is manufactured from human blood . Human blood is the basis of it . And to get that blood every Apexan must yield his quota in the temple . Slowly but surely this practice is sapping the vitality of the race . But though the Apexans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the Heads were worshipped as gods ; and when the gods spoke , blasphemers died -- horribly. " * * * * * Miles and Ward shuddered . " Even I , " went on Spiro , " denounced blasphemers and thought it holy that each should yield a little of his blood to the Almighty Ones . Then I woke from darkness to find myself -- a Head . At first I could not understand , for I was in love with Ah-eeda -- and can a machine mate ? But it is true that love is largely desire , and desire of the body . With the death of the body , desire died ; and it may be that pride and ambition took its place . But , for all that , there were moments when I remembered my lost manhood and dreamed of Ah-eeda . Yes , though the laboratory of the Heads revealed wonders of which I had never dreamed , though I looked into your world and studied its languages and history , though I was worshipped as a god and endless life stretched ahead of me -- nevertheless , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sapped , its virility lost ! " His voice broke . " In the face of such knowledge what were immortality and power ? Could they compensate for one hour of life and love as humanity lived it ? So I brooded . Then one day in the temple I looked into the face of a girl about to be bled and recognized Ah-eeda . In that moment , hatred of the fiends posing as gods and draining the vitality of deluded worshippers , crystallized and drove me to action . So it was I who denounced the Heads , aroused the people ! " Spiro 's voice broke ; died . Miles and Ward stared at him , horrified ; and after a while Miles exclaimed , " We never suspected ! We would never have fought to maintain such a thing had we known ! " " Nonetheless , " said Spiro inflexibly , " you fought for it , and many people died and more are afraid . Superstition is a hard thing to kill . Already there are those who murmur that truly the Heads are gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they threatened they would , to smite them with thunder until once more they yield blood in the temple . But I know that without blood the Heads must die miserably and the people be freed from their vampire existence . It is true that I too shall die , but that is nothing . I die gladly . Therefore , to keep the people from sacrificing blood , to show them that you are mortal and the Heads powerless to save the demons they have raised , you must be slain in front of the great palace . " Yes ; you , too , must die for the people ! " * * * * * Bound and helpless , lying on their backs and staring into the gloom of the small chamber into which they had been thrown , Miles and Ward had time to ponder their desperate situation . Spiro was delaying their death until the workers of Apex would have time to gather and witness it . At first they had struggled to loosen their bonds , but such efforts served only to tighten them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the fingers of one might endeavor to undo the knots securing the other . On a memorable occasion in Turkey they had freed themselves in this manner . But the attempts proved fruitless now . The floor of the chamber was smooth , nor could they find any rough projection on which to saw the cords . Exhausted , they finally desisted . The same thought was in both minds : Were they doomed to die in this strange world , fated never to see Earth again ? Well , a soldier of fortune must expect to meet with reverses . Still , it was a tough break . After a long silence Ward said , " How were we to know that the heads lived on the blood of the people ? " " Would it have made any difference if we had known ? " asked Miles . " Perhaps not . " Ward tried to shrug his shoulders . " After all , we have fought to maintain systems not much better . There is little difference , save in degree , between draining the life-blood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor . " " But sometimes we fought to liberate people , " protested Miles . " Yes , I like to think of that . It 's good to have something to our credit when we cash in . And it looks , " he said pessimistically , " as if our time to do so has come . " * * * * * They ceased talking . Time passed cheerlessly . Finally both of them fell into a heavy slumber from which they were aroused by the sudden flashing in their eyes of a bright light , bright only in comparison with the former intense darkness . " What 's that ! " cried Ward , startled . " S-sh , " said a soft voice warningly , and when their eyes became accustomed to the illumination , they were amazed to perceive the slender form of a young girl carrying a torch . She was marvelously lovely to look at , with her blue-black hair brushed straight back from a low , broad forehead and her smooth skin as dark as that of an Egyptian . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ancient Egypt . The embroidered plates covering the small breasts shone and glittered ; bracelets and bangles flashed on bare arms and shapely ankles ; while from the waist to below the knees was a skirt of rich material . On the small feet were sandals of intricate design . Besides the torch , the girl carried a slim , gleaming knife , and for a moment the adventurers were guilty of imagining she had come to slay them where they lay . But her manner quickly dispelled their fear . Sinking on her knees beside them , she said , " Do not be afraid ; Ah-eeda will not harm you . " * * * * * So this was Ah-eeda , the girl of whom Spiro had spoken . Miles and Ward devoured her loveliness with their eyes ; her coming flooded their bosoms with renewed hope . She continued speaking . Her English was not at all fluent , and she was often compelled to make it clear with expressions in her own tongue and with explanatory gestures . But to Miles and Ward , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all was a miracle . " Is it true that you are men from another world ? " " Yes . " " And you came to make the people give their blood to the Heads ? " " No , that is not true . We were in ignorance of what it was we fought for . Had we known the truth we would have refused to fight for the Heads . " " Then , if I were to set you free , you would go back to your own world and not fight my people any more ? " They nodded vigorously . " Oh , I am so glad , " exclaimed the girl ; " I did not want to see you die ! " She looked at Miles as she spoke . " I saw you before Spiro this afternoon . Poor Spiro ! " she murmured as she cut their bonds . It was some time before circulation was restored to their limbs . Miles asked anxiously , " How many guards are there at the door ? " " Twelve , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room outside and drinking soola . " She pantomimed her meaning . " I came here through a secret passage beyond , " she indicated by a wave of her hand . " Now that you can walk , let us hurry . " Shyly she took Miles ' hand . The warm clasp of her fingers made the blood course faster in his veins . Through a long passage they glided to another room . There were several confusing turns and dark hallways , and twice they had to cower in shadowy corners while Ah-eeda boldly advanced and held converse with occasional persons encountered , though for the most part the way was silent and deserted . At last they came to a low door opening on a narrow street and the girl put out her torch . " To return to our own world we must first reach the Palace of the Heads , " said Ward . The girl nodded . " I will guide you there . But we must hurry : the workers will soon be gathered . " * * * * * Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girl led them through narrow and devious byways over which dark buildings leaned , evidently avoiding the more direct and open thoroughfares . It seemed as if they were to escape without hindrance when , suddenly , out of a dimly lighted doorway , lurched the gigantic figure of a green man carrying a flare . This flare threw the figures of the fugitives into relief . " Ho ! " roared the green man , and came at them like a furious bull . It seemed characteristic of his kind to attack without parley . The torch dropped as he came . There was no resisting that mighty bulk . Unarmed , and with scant room to move backward , the two Americans went down ; and that would have been the end of the battle if Ah-eeda , who had shrunk to one side out of the way of the combatants , had not snatched up the still flaming torch and held it against the naked back of the greenish giant . With a scream of anguish the latter ceased throttling the Americans , clapped his hands to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they staggered to their feet and fled down the roadway after the light-footed Ah-eeda . Behind them the screams of the green man made the night hideous . " Damn him ! " panted Ward ; " he 'll have the whole town on our heels ! " Providentially , at that moment the road debouched into the great square . This they crossed at a run , and so , for the last time , entered the Palace of the Heads . Its wide halls and chambers were practically deserted . Past the crystal chamber where they had first materialized into this strange world they dashed , and through the far door and down the corridor to the blank wall . Already in the rear could be heard the sound of pursuit , the rising clamor of the mob . Ward hammered on the wall with both fists . " Zoro ! Zoro ! let us in ! " Now the first of the mob had entered the corridor . " Zoro ! Zoro ! " Noiselessly , and just in time , the wall parted and they sprang through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wall closed behind them , obliterating the fierce cries and footbeats of their pursuers . * * * * * In front of them was Zoro , his hairless head projecting from the tubular container . Ah-eeda shrank fearfully into Miles ' embrace . All the other Heads were ranged back of Zoro , but there was something odd about them . The massive craniums lolled loosely to one side or another and the curiously colored eyes were glazed or filmed . Zoro held his head erect , but only with an effort , and his features were drawn and ghastly looking . " Yes , " he said in a feeble voice , " the Heads are dying . You need not tell me that you have failed . In the end force always fails . No longer will the veins of the people yield their blood to us , and without their blood we can not live . Soon three hundred thousand years of intelligence will be no more . " His voice faltered . Miles and Ward had learned to feel nothing but horror and detestation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragic end , hearing the dying words of Zoro , awe and sympathy struggled with other emotions in their hearts . These mighty intellects had lived before the days of the flood ; their eyes filming now in death had seen the ancient empires of Earth rise and fall .... Sumeria , Babylon .... Stupendous thought ; and yet in the face of death a hundred thousand years of life was of no more importance than that of a day . Suddenly Ward sprang forward and shook the fainting Head . " Zoro ! Zoro ! what of us ? We served you faithfully and would now return to Earth . " * * * * * Visibly Zoro made a great effort to reply . " Go to the crystal tube in the laboratory beyond , " he said at last . " It still works . I have told you how to run the car . Mend the tracks . The locks open automatically and let the car into the ocean when it strikes the switch . Your reward is in .... " The words died away . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head straightened , the strangely colored eyes cleared , and in a loud voice Zoro called out something in an unknown tongue and then collapsed . Out of that chamber of death the Americans fled , suddenly afraid of its weird occupants . In time the workers of Apex would break into that strange laboratory and find the vampires of the ages dead . And in a very short time Spiro himself would die -- Spiro the avenger . At the crystal tube Miles paused . " Ah-eeda , " he said softly , " we return to Earth , but I shall never forget you , never ! " A moment he hesitated , and then bent and kissed her swiftly . Instantly she was in his arms , clinging to him passionately . " I too , " she cried ; " I too ! " " She means , " said Ward , " that she wants to go back with us . What do you say ? " " God knows I am tempted to take her , " said Miles ; " but would it be right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Ward ; " but I believe she loves you . And have you thought that after helping us to escape she may not be safe among her own people ? " Miles bowed his head . " Very well , " he said ; " so be it . I swear to make her happy . " So there were three of them who entered the crystal tube . * * * * *
