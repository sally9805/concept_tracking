txt Competitive bidding by underwriters for new corporate security issues came out into the open as an issue before the Temporary National Economic Committee investigation of investment banking yesterday . The committee staff 's critical approach to the present method of negotiated agreements between issuers and underwriters brought up compulsory public bidding as a possible alternative despite the obvious intention of SEC experts iu charge of the study to keep that question in the background for the time being . Harold Stanley . president of Morgan Stanley &; Co .. taking advantage of questions from ( Text of ** Stairlet 's discussion on competitive bidding is on Page 6. ) committee Chairman GMahoney , brought this issue to the fore and , in a brief handed to committee members , warned that compulsory bidding in the handling of corporate securities would not be a cure-all for ills which may be present in current practices . Leon Henderson . SEC representative on the committee , anxious to keep the competitive bidding issue under wraps until the SEC 's handlers of the hearings bring it out . heatedly protested when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to committee members , although it will not be made a part of the record . Henderson Cites Reason Mr. Henderson said he was objecting because the SEC staff is studying the competitive bidding question and would submit information to the committee at a later date . Also , he said , this question is involved in cases before the SEC. and that since the commission is a quasijudicial body he wanted the record of the hearing to show he took no part in the discussion . Further . he protested , interests having " opposing views " on this issue have been pressing the SEC for a hearing and have been advised that the subject will not be taken up at this time . Mr. Henderson charged that Senator O'Mahoney 's approval of the submission of a brief by Mr. Stanley to committee members was in " disregardance of orderly presentation of information " and that it was a " backdoor method " of bringing the issue up . Senator O'Mahoney , in irritated and sarcastic manner , retorted that he regretted having asked the questions which brought the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then told Mr. Stanley he saw no reason why the brief should not be given committee members In his brief . Mr. Stanley listed five specific objections to compulsory competitive bidding and cautioned that the institution of such a system would be " destructive " to the aims of investment banking , which he said should be toward greater responsibility and higher professional standards . The five objections follow : 1 . A compulsory competitive bidding system would minimize the investment bankers sense of responsibility and destroy his professional relations with his client . 2 There would be a strong tendency toward over-pricing of securities and high-pressure salesmanship 3 . Competitive bidding would encourage - shoddy goods " since investment bankers competing against each other for issues would be in no position to make sure that the terms of the security would protect the investor . 4 The joint study and cooperation in the preparation of documents required by the Securities Act " would be largely eliminated . " 5 Competitive bidding would tend to eliminate the small dealer throughout the country . The Securities normally sold by competitive bidding those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment trust certificates , are , under normal conditions . more or less standardized and simple in form , Mr. Stanley pointed out in his brief . Favors Competition In criticizing competitive bidding for corporate securities , a proposal which had come in for much discussion during the past year or so . Mr. Stanley told the committee he did not mean to imply that " there should not be competition among investment bankers. - Such competition , he said , exists today and should continue to exist . Mr. Stanley said his belief " as to the unsoundness of the ( competitive bidding- ) practice from the point of view of both the investor and the issuing corporation ends confirmation in the fact it has never been voluntarily adopted as a general practice by issuing corporations or requested by investors in this country or . as far as 1 know , in any other country . " Under the present system of negotiating underwriting arrangements , Mr. Stanley said the issuing corporations obtain professional advice on the type of security to be issued and also on the terms , probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , he continued would not stop new corporate financing . " but it would have far-reaching and in my opinion undesirable effects upon the method by which that financing is acomplished . " Senator O'Mahoney Raises Subject This subject was brought up by Senator O'Mahoney , who said that the " public interest " in Morgan Stanley &; Co. arises from the comparative merits of selling securities by negotiations and by public bidding . He pointed out the railroads are required by the Interstate Commerce Commission to sell equipment trust securities by public bidding , while the American Telephone &; Telegraph Co .. one of the largest and strongest corporations in the world . sells its securities by negotiations . Mr. Stanley said public bidding might tend to overprice securities and encourage low-grade issues . . Also , he said , public bidding would tend to " eliminate the small dealer , " although groups would continue to function . Earlier in his testimony . when Mr. Nehemkis was comparing J. P. Morgan &; Co. profits from A .. T. &; T. business from 1920 to 1930 with profits by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserted that it is two or three or ten times as hard to do business today as it was in the 20 's . He said this was due to regulations and that while he favored the principle of the SEC , it had raised the cost of doing business " considerably . " Illinois Bell Refunding When Mr. Stanley took the witness stand at the outset of the day 's hearing , Mr. Nehemkis , committee counsel , questioned him about the handling of the $43,700,000 Illinois Bell refunding issue in 1935 . Mr. Nehemkis sought to show that after J. P. Morgan &; Co. divorced itself of its investment banking business , Morgan Stanley &; Co. took over and handled the telephone business . Last week and Monday , Mr. Nehemkis attempted to show that from 1920 to 1930 J. P Morgan &; Co. handled all telephone issues , under an agreement fixing the percentage of participation of each of the underwriters . Mr. Nehemkis placed in the record a letter dated September 26 , 1935 , from Charles E. Mitchell , head of Blyth &; Co. , Inc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Stanley had told him that the Myth company would not handle any of the Illinois Bell Telephone refunding issue . Mr. Mitchell said in his letter that Morgan Stanley &; Co. " are bound " by past relations in handling the telephone issues and that if Blyth do Co. should be brobight'in on the refunding issue four or five other firms would have to be included . Mr. Stanley said he did not tell Mr. Mitchell that Morgan Stanley &; Co was " bound " by past business relations of J. P. Morgan &; Co. and that the Mitchell letter did not , in this respect , correctly reflect his attitude . While asserting that he " accepted " Mr. Stanley 's statement . Mr. Nehemkis said 21 " seems rather difficult that a responsible member of the financial community would sc thoroughly misunderstanding an old friend . " In discussing handling of the Illinois Bell refunding issue . Mr. Stanley told the committee that the A. T. &; T. ' ' looked to us for a responsible group of underwriters " and made Morgan-Stanley guarantee performance on the Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a big underwriting syndicate , since a large number of underwriters might " make the issue look weak . " In selecting underwriters to participate in handling this issue , Mr. Stanley said he had considered the past connections of Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. and Kidder . Peabody &; Co in handling the telephone business . He listed the underwriters on the Illinois Bell issue as Morgan Stanley , Kuhn Loeb . Kidder Peabody , Lee Rigginson &; Co .. First Boston Corp .. Brown , Harriman &; Co. , E. B. Smith &; Co . Mellon Securities Co. and Bonbright &; Co . Mr. Nehemkis placed in the record a September 27 , 1935 memorandum from the files of Lee . Higginson &; Co in which E. N. Jessup said Mr. Stanley had emphasized that " these interests were for this piece of business only and they were not at the moment forming a telephone group . " Mr. Jessup gave it as his guess " that they do not want to be committed to this group in these amounts for future telephone business owing to the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future . " Committee counsel Nehemkis yesterday recalled George Whitney , partner in J. P. Morgan &; Co. , to the witness stand and questioned him , along with Arthur M. Anderson , Morgan company partner , and Joseph R. Swan of Smith Barney &; Co. , about the part played by the Morgan company in railroad financing since the 1933 banking act , which required banks of deposit to divorce their investment banking business , became effective in June , 1934 . Mr. Whitney readily told the committee that railroads , some or them old clients of the Morgan company , had come to him for advice on refunding . He said he gave them advice and even suggested underwriters to handle refunding issues , but insisted he did not " determine " which houses would handle the business . " Our clients came to us for advice , " Mr. Whitney said . " The investment banking business had faced a serious readjustment . They came to us because they had always sought our advice . We still give our clients advice and unless the law is changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
