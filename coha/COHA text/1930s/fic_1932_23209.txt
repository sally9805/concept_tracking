TOWN GIRL A STORY BY ELAINE STERNE CARRINGTON S HE was prettier than his sister , Janet . She was prettier than any of Janet 's friends ; than Doris Franklin , for instance , sitting there across the table from him talking brightly first to his father then to his mother , smiling at him , when he caught her eye , with perhaps just a touch of pity because he so obviously was incapable of appreciating her good looks . Good looks ! Why , beside Hilda 's glowing beauty , Doris , poor child , was plain , colorless , and dull . His father 's voice cut across his thoughts . " Richard , " he was saying , " will drive you to the show . We may drop in later . " " He will , " said Janet , " if he can manage to sandwich in a movie among his many other engagements . " There was a moment 's complete silence in which , without so much as raising his eyes , Richard could see his father frowning at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently , saw nothing . She said innocently , " I should n't think anybody 'd have a date on a night when Clark Gable 's showing . " " You 'd be surprised , " said Janet . Damn Janet ! He thought again of that meeting at the Post Office with Hilda , felt the agony of embarrassment because , being with Janet , he dared not stop and speak to her , could only mutter " Hello " under his breath , as if hewere ashamed of knowing her . That was it  --  ashamed . Janet had stopped in to buy some stamps . She passed Hilda by without a glance , but Richard , his heart pounding , his face a fiery red , bung back and stared at her . She wore a blue sweater suit , and under it her body , softly , deliciously curved , was half revealed . He could see the outline of her little , rounded breasts , the curve of her hip line , the small fiat waist . She had milk-white skin and the ash-blond hair that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But hers was the real thing ; at the roots , where the new hairs were coming in , they were like fine white floss . She wore it short , and it fluffed out around her small head like a bright halo . Strangely enough , her eyes were dark with tremendous black pupils , and she had a delicious nose , straight and narrow . She was talking to Tony de Petrus but when she saw Richard she nodded and smiled . Richard did not return the smile . He felt a cold , unreasoning fury at seeing her chatting unconcernedly to a wop like de Petrus , who delivered bulky parcels to your hack door ; who admitted the boys and the town girls to a back room of his ugly , squalid little house on Railroad Avenue that reeked of stale beer and cheap wine . Why should Hilda have to stand there talking to swine like Tony , when the boys she entertained , the boys who fought for her favor after nightfall slipped past her sheepishly or raced in and out of the Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the station wagon , said , " I see your girl friend has a beau ? ' He turned to pour out his wrath upon her , then stopped . That was exactly what she wanted : to prod him to anger , to get him to give himself away in a hot rush of words . She cast an oblique glance at him . " Too bad she ca n't get somebody better than the town bootlegger . " He bit his lip . He would n't . She could n't make him , no matter what she said . " Still , I suppose a girl with a reputation like hers is lucky to get anybody to talk to her  --  in broad daylight . " Something within him snapped . " You 're jealous of her . All of you are jealous of her . You know you are . " Janet laughed , a high , brittle laugh . " Jealous ! Of Hilda Olsen ? Oh , my God ! I must remember to tell that to the girls . Jealous ! Oh , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . He was surprised to find himself shaking as if with a chill . " Tell everybody ! There 's not one of you who can hold a candle to her ! " " Well , it 's true that none of us uses the , well , the same technic to attract men , any men , all men . " " The difference between her and you , " he said in a frenzy of rage ( he wished he could kill Janet , sitting there at the wheel , so calm , so confident of herself and of her position ) , " is that she does n't have to do anything toto  --  attract men , as you call it . All she has to do is to be herself . " " Mother Earth personified , " said Janet , softly . " The Great Female of the Species . Woman Incarnate . " " Yes , " said Richard . Suddenly he was no longer angry . He felt almost kindly towards Janet for having , inadvertently , put her finger on the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him sharply . " Do n't be a fool ! " she said . " Nobody minds your pawing the town girls if you have to , but for Pete 's sake , do n't get sentimental about any of them . They do n't breathe the same air we breathe . They do n't even speak the same language . " Richard did not reply . He was saying over and over to himself , " Mother Earth . Woman Incarnate . " After dinner he slipped out the back door , got his car and drove to town . The excuse he gave himself  --  and he needed one as he flew by the open living room window and heard Doris 's tinkle of laughter  --  was that he owed Hilda an apology for himself and his family . She must certainly have been hurt by Janet 's rudeness , by her presumption that because , by some gracious stroke of Providence , she lived on the Hill near the Club it gave her an inalienable right to ignore Hilda , with whom , by the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this , he knew in his secret heart of hearts , was not his real reason for going to see her . The real reason was that he wanted , more than anything else on earth , to be near her , to hear her voice , see her smile perhaps , even touch her hand . Tenaciously , however , his mind clung to the letter of his errand . It was childish of Janet to pretend not to know Hilda , particularly as Hilda clerked in Bennett 's Dry Goods Store , where everyone stopped in to buy a yard of this or that . It was like pretending not to know Mr. Schultz , the grocer , or Mr. Saybrook , the butcher , or Mr. Bissell , the druggist . But all the while his feelings , rather than his thoughts , were tangled up with Hilda herself . What would she be wearing ? What would she say when she saw him ? Could he get her away from the inevitable crowd and have her to himself for a few minutes ? Outside her house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came the tinny screech of an old Victor ; laughter , the sound of young voices . Richard got out slowly . He did not quite know what he was going to say about Janet . He wished he need say nothing . He wished he need not feel ashamed for himself , and his family ; need not feel that a rank injustice was being done Hilda by them all , by society as a whole . She apparently felt nothing of the sort . She made the boys who came there welcome . She served them drinks , she danced with them , she hobnobbed with them , she went on long moonlight rides with them . He had never been able to discover a single trace of resentment in anything she said or did . Several girls and half a dozen boys were crowded into the small , cramped living room and were having a glorious time . You always had a glorious time at Hilda 's . The lid was off . You danced if you felt like it . You sang if you felt like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out to the narrow side porch , with its sagging swing , and told a girl all about yourself ; you climbed into your car and sped off with her alone . And that , come to think of it , was the one big difference between the town girls and Janet 's friends . Here the men did the deciding . Girls were merely pleasant passive partners . They did as they were told . The men did the telling  --  or made a show of telling . Hilda was glad to see him . She was glad to see everyone . Standing beneath the light 's bright rays , her hair was a cloud of burnished gold round her face . She wore a pale pink dress and out of it emerged the incredibly white column of her throat ; and her arms , like alabaster , exquisitely molded . She was , he thought , like some lovely statue come to life . For a moment she was busy with her guests but presently she came over to where he stood . " Hello , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing . " He was sulky . He hated the rest of them , gaping at her , snatching at her as she passed , catching her to them , kissing her bare shoulder . " Oh , come on , have a little drink . You 'll feel better . " She was smiling her beautiful , her irresistible smile ; and behind it he sensed her real kindness , her real desire to help if help be needed . " No , thanks . I 've got to get back . Got to take the girls to the movies . I only ran down for a second . " " What 's the matter ? " She had to raise her voice to drown out a quartet , heads together , bent on harmonizing the Something-or-other Blues . " Ca n't we get out of here ? " he demanded irritably . " Sure . " She slipped her arm through his . " Ca n't we take a spin ? " " Well , I do n't know ? " " Just a little ways . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He helped her into the car . He wished suddenly , unreasonably , that she had refused to go ; that she had forced him to make his apology for Janet and himself first . " Is n't it a grand night ? " She flung back her head and drank in the warm , earthy sweetness of the air . " Is it ? " He started the engine , the car glided forward . " Now then , tell mother all about it . " Mother . Mother Earth . Woman Incarnate . " Hilda , I want to say something to you . I do n't know how to begin . " " Then do n't begin . " " I 've got to . " " What is it ? " " I- " How the devil ! " I  --  well , look here . I 'm sore at Janet . Say , she 's got no business cutting you that way . " " Janet ? " Her voice held surprise . " You mean at the Post Office ? Why , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be that dumb ; or if she was , he 'd crucify himself anyhow . " Sure she saw you , and you know she saw you . It makes me sore . Damn sore . " " Why ? I do n't belong to her crowd . " " You 're as good as they are . You 're a whole Iot better . " She laughed gaily . " Oh , Dick , you did n't tell her that , did you ? " " Oh , did n't I ? I told her that and a whole lot more . I told her where she got off . " She squeezed his arm . " You 're an awful peach , Dick , but do n't do it again . It wo n't do any good . " He knew she was right . The very knowledge was like the flick of a whip . " Well , she made me sore , anyhow , just because you happen to be a town girl . " " But I do n't mind being a town girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They drove along , in silence . Then he remembered something else he had to say to her . " See here , you do n't mind my talking to you like a Dutch uncle , do you ? " " No , of course not . " " It 's  --  it 's  --  well , it 's none of my business , of course , only , if I were you , I would n't  --  you see , Tony de Petrus is ? well ? what I mean to say , you know , talking to him there at the Post Office , that way , with everybody coming in and out ? " Her laughter disconcerted him . " You mean I should n't talk to Tony ? " " Yes . He 's just a wop bootlegger . " " But I like Tony . " " You like ? " He stopped the car abruptly . " Say , Hilda , you do n't understand . Tony 's not in your class ? he 's not good enough  --  he ? " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Always calling him that . Nice kid . Cute kid . Funny kid . " Hilda , " he blurted out ; " The reason I 'm saying all this is because I 'm ? I 'm nuts about you . Oh , not like the others . I mean , I like you better than anyone else . I mean I ca n't think of anything but you . I mean I ca n't even sleep without dreaming about you , that 's why  --  that 's why ? " he stopped , choked by his emotion . Her face , a pale moon , swam closer to his . " I like you too , Dick . " " No . I do n't mean like . I mean love . I mean ? " She moved closer still and , at the touch of her , a flame shot through him , his words tumbled out in a torrent . " I mean I ca n't stand having people say things about you . I do n't care who they are . I do n't care if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister . I love you , Hilda . I love you . " He had his arms around her now . He found her mouth and felt the passionate pressure of her lips . He could not think . He could merely stammer little broken sentences . " You 're so beautiful . . . . I 've always loved you . . . . You 're so sweet . . . You 're not like anybody else . . . . I want everybody to know . . . . I want everybody to hear about it . " Suddenly he thrust her away from him . " Do you love me ? You have n't said it . You 've never said it . Say it . " " Of course I do . " " Say it . " " I love you . " She laughed as she spoke . " Do n't say it that way . " She sat up , swept the hair out of her eyes . " Come on , we 've got to get back . You 'll be late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're waiting for you . " " Let them wait . " When they drew up at her house , she jumped out and ran up the steps . " Hey , " he called , " what about tomorrow night ? " She turned , nodded . " Sure . Tomorrow night . O.K. " Then she went indoors . To-morrow night . . Janet and Doris were on the porch . " Well , " said Janet coldly , " we certainly appreciate your condescending to come hack for us . " " You ought to . " They got into the car , crowding onto the front seat , with Doris in the center . Doris smelled faintly of some disturbingly sweet perfume She said , " It looks as if it 's going to be a grand night to-morrow for the party . " Party . To-morrow night . At the Hunt Club . He had forgotten it completely . " I wo n't be there , " he said shortly , " I 've got a date . " Janet cried , " A date ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party for ages . You 're just saying that to sound important . " " Maybe he wants to be coaxed , " said Doris softly . " Do you ? " He smiled to himself . Doris and her perfume and her shoulder pressed insistently against his . Nothing she could say , nothing she could do , could touch him . It was as if she did not exist . As if no one existed but Hilda . " Maybe , " he said . His father called him into the library after breakfast . He said , " Sit down , Richard , " pleasantly enough , but there was an undercurrent of irritation in his voice . When they were seated , both of them feeling awkward and ill at case , he said , still in the even , conversational tone he had apparently determined to adopt for the interview , " Well , what 's all this I hear about your being tied up to-night ? " Richard looked down at his hands . " Yes , sir . That 's right . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes , sir . " " And knowing it , how did you happen to make another engagement ? " " I do n't care much about dances . I 'd  --  I 'd rather do something elsp . " " For example ? " Richard looked up , quickly , then returned to a close scrutiny of his hands . " I do n't know . Go out with the fellows or do something . " " Do what , for instance ? " " Oh . go around . " There was a pause during which Richard knew that his father was deciding whether to press the point or to fence a little longer . Fencing won out . " It 's pretty hard on your sister , your running off this way . " Richard 's head came up with a jerk . " Hard on Janet ? What 's it to do with her ? " " Well , after all , she has Doris visiting her and she rather expected you 'd take her around , you know . " " I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His father said , " That 's no way to speak about your sister . " " I mean it . She 's been rotten to my friends , so why should n't 1 ? " " Friends ? " " Yes , friends . " " What friends ? " The color flamed into Richard 's face . Trapped . No escape . if he lied Janet was sure to tell the truth , with embellishments . " Well , then , Hilda Olsen . " His father wrinkled his forehead . " Hilda Olsen ? I do n't seem to ? " " Oh , yes you do . You know her . Her old man ran a paint shop in the village . " " You mean a town girl ? " " Yes , sir . " " But I ca n't see what Janet had to do with this  --  this --  --  " " She .. . Oh , you would n't understand . You would n't get it . But it is n't fair just because a girl happens to be born outside your circle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . Cut her . That 's what I said . " " But it does n't sound like Janet . Perhaps ? " " I saw it . What do you take me for ? I saw Janet walk past her as if  --  as if she was scum under her feet . And she 's as good as she is . And a hell of a lot better . " " Wait a minute . Wait a minute . Easy there . " " You 'd agree with me too , if you knew her . " " And is the date you have to-night , by any possible chance , with Miss Olsen ? " Pause . " Yes . " " I see . Well , in that case I 'm afraid I 'll have to ask you to break it . " " Break it ? Why should I break it ? You 're pretty much of a stickler when it comes to what I should do and what I should n't do , but you think it 's all right for me to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stop ! " said his father , " You ca n't say I 've ever objected to anything you did . I 've encouraged it . But if it 's come to a point where you ca n't differentiate between a girl like Doris Franklin and this Hilda Olsen , I can see it 's high time I stepped in . By all means have your fun . No one objects to that . But keep the two spheres apart . Do anything you like only do n't get your lines crossed and do n't fool around with local talent . That 's all I ask . " Richard rose , slowly . " Keep them apart , keep the girl in town away frommy sister and my sister 's friends , is that it ? " " That 's it . " " Well , I 'm sorry but I do n't see the difference in them , except that Hilda 's got it all over the girls Janet knows for good looks and good manners and good taste . And I would n't break a date with her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't do a thing like that because I like her too much , for one thing , and because I respect her and because I 'd rather be with her than with anybody else in the whole world . " His father rose , too . " I 'll see you at the Club to-night , Richard , " he said , pleasantly . " That 's all . " " It 's not all at all . I wo n't be there . I wo n't he within five miles of the Club . " His father held open the library door . " You 'll be there because I tell you to and because your own good sense will tell you to . There are two kinds of girls , the girls you grow up with and marry and the girls you grow up with and do not marry . They do n't mix . Each has her place in the scheme of things . I merely ask you to use your head and act like a man , instead of a moon-struck I-don't-know-what . " He smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy ! " Richard said , wanting to pound something , smash it to bits . " I 'll show you and the rest of them I mean what I say when I say Hilda 's as good as they are . I mean it , do you hear me ? I mean it . You do n't think so , because you 're a snob like the rest ; but I do . show you . I 'll . . . " His father laid a kindly hand on his shoulder . " Nothing to get excited about , Sonny ; merely remember that there 's a place for everything and everything has its place . " Hilda was waiting for him on the porch . For a wonder she was alone . He could see the swing moving slowly back and forth , back and forth ; he could hear its rusty creak , He called out , " Hilda , come here . " She got up , came slowly down the steps towards him . " Get in , " he said ; " I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She got in . " You sound excited . " " I am excited . Terribly excited . Never so excited in my life . " The car jerked forward . " Hilda , " he said abruptly , " will you go up to the Hunt Club dance with me to-night ? Now ? " " The Hunt Club dance ! " " Yes . " She was silent , so silent that he turned swiftly , to see her face , for once , stripped of laughter . Then she said , " No . " " Why not ? " " Well  --  my dress  --  I have n't got on the right dress . " " We 'll go back and you can change . " " No . But what made you ask me , Dick ? " " What made me ? Why should n't I ask you ? " She said , after a pause , " Maybe I will , sometime . I 'd kind of like to . But not to-night . " " Oh , come on . Just this once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what do you say ? Let 's show them ? " " No . Honest . I 'd rather not . " " Wo n't you please ? Just for me ? " " No . But ? " " But what ? " " If you just drive up around the Club and do n't stop , I 'd love that . " " Drive up around it ? What for ? " " I 'd like to . " " Once I get you up there I 'll make you come in . See if I do n't . " " No . Just drive around slow , I mean , and maybe park for a second . " Music floated out to them across the black , uneven ground . Richard swung the car up the driveway , parked it , snapped off the lights . From where they sat they could see , through the open windows , the couples revolving , disappearing , heads and shoulders , an endless procession . Richard hummed the tune they were playing ; his heart was heating rapidly . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the edge of icy water . " Come on . " He caught hold of her hand . " Let 's go in . " He half pulled her to her feet . And at that instant the music stopped , and they collapsed laughing on the seat . " Well , " he said , " That 's that . " They could hear the faint patter of applause , an instant 's silence , then the shrill chatter of voices , and the couples surged out on the porch , gathered in little vivid knots , the girls ' bright dresses , the boys ' black dinner coats plainly visible under the string of colored lights . One of the girls spun around with her partner like a dervish , stopped , laughing and giddy . It was Doris . She looked ravishing with her cheeks flushed , her short hair swirled around her eyes . She brushed it back , caught her partner 's arm , and ran him down the steps . They came across the grass towards the car . " Look , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Instead of answering , instead of calling out to her , Richard shrank back . The very gesture , pressing his shoulder tight against the cushions of the car , waiting , rigid , tense , breathless for her to pass , was new and startling to him . They moved away . He could see her dress , a flutter of white , merge into the surrounding darkness . He thought desperately , I ought n't to have done that . I ought to have called her over and introduced Hilda . And at the same time he thought , I ca n't . Suppose she 's snooty to her . Suppose she 's high hat . Suppose she gets off a wisecrack . I ought to save Hilda from this . I ought n't to let her lay herself open to insult . I 've got to protect her . I never should have brought her here at all . God ! Suppose when I take her inside they ask her to leave . . . The very thought brought out a cold sweat on his forehead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a flash , it was not for her . It was for himself . He was afraid . Of Doris . Of Janet . Of his mother . Of his father . Of his multitude of friends . How would he feel when they stopped , stared , whispered ? Theirs was one world , definite and apart . Hilda 's was another . Sitting there beside her in the chill darkness , an overwhelming sense of sadness stabbed at his heart like a knife . He felt as if he too were an alien ; as if a wall too high to scale were flung up between himself and the gay , thoughtless crowd , lingering on the steps , shouting across darkness , moving back towards the clubhouse . The music began with a flourish of trumpets . The boys and girls scampered up the steps . " Come on . " " Hey , wait a minute , ca n't you ? " " Where 's Betty ? " " Why ask me ? " A trickle of perspiration ran down his cheek . His hands were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Talk about something . About . anything . " Hilda . " " Yes ? " " Did you  --  did you notice the old boathouse site as we drove up ? " " What ? " " The old boathouse site . On K Street . You know , the one that burned down last year . That 's  --  that 's where they 're going to put up a swell yacht club . Remember the old boathouse ? It was a fire trap all right , but I kind of liked it . Theyhad ping-pong tables for us kids and quoits and we 'd go down there on rainy afternoons ? " No answer . What was she thinking behind her silence ? What was she feeling ? The orchestra leader was singing . His voice , husky , low , came out to them : " Just a little love nest for two , Just a place to bill and to coo , Just a little love nest For my best And me . " He was conscious of a movement on Hilda 's part . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a cool little voice , " I 've changed my mind . I 'll go in with you . I 'd like to , " and sprang out . He caught her arm . " Hilda . Wait . Wait a minute . Hold on . Hilda . Maybe  --  maybe  --  we 'd better not tonight ? " He thought , desperately , why am I doing this ? Why am I a coward ? Why ? Why ? She turned slowly , brushed off his hand , and said in a voice which held a note of amusement , " But that 's what you brought me here for , is n't it ? " " Yes , of course , only -- - " " Only what ? " " Only I forgot . I mean , I forgot it 's a kind of  --  of private dance . I mean , one of the girls is having a special party given for her . I mean , it 's different with just our own crowd here . " He stammered , faltered , stopped . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , , She got into the car again , quietly . She said , after a minute , " All right , then , let 's go . " " You are n't  --  you are n't sore , are you ? " " No . " " Some other night , when it is n't a special party ? " She broke in quickly , " Let 's go now . " He turned the car . He felt he could never speak to her again . Never look into her eyes . On the way home she said , " I want to tell you something , Dick , " and when he did not speak , she went on , " I 'm going to marry Tony . " " Tony ! " This brought him up with a start . " What ! " " This winter . Before Christmas , I guess . " " Tony ! " he felt actually ill . Hilda and Tony . " But you do n't  --  you ca n't love him . " " No , perhaps not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Oh , because I want to get married , I guess . I do n't know . " He thought suddenly , Janet 's right . We do n't breathe the same air . We do n't speak the same language . He said stiffly , " I did n't know about it or I would n't have spoken last night as I did . " " I had n't quite made up my mind then , " she said , " but I have now . " She added , after a minute , " He 's a nice fellow , when you get to know him , and he 's got a good business . He makes his own stuff and after we 're married he 's going to build a little room onto his house for dancing , you know , and I hope you 'll come over often . It ought to be nice I think . " Come over . You must come over and see Hilda and Tony together . Know that after you leave they 'll clean up , turn out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , suddenly , " Hilda , why are you doing this thing ? What 's the matter with you ? " She shrugged , laughed , " I do n't know . " At her house he helped her out . By the light of the rising moon she looked indescribably lovely . She held out her hand . " See you soon . " He caught it and swept her to him in a fierce embrace , and because she yielded passively , because she did not resent his lips crushing her own , his arms wrapped around her like steel bands , he let her go , with a faint feeling of revulsion . Any girl should have resented a kiss like that , or responded to it . But she stood there smiling , her beautiful mouth curved over her white teeth . " Good night . Sleep tight . " Oh , God ! Oh , God ! Why was n't she born my equal . . .. What do you mean , equal ? Getting high hat , eh ? Think you 're better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president instead of a house painter ? " ' Night , Hilda . " He drove off . Looking back , he saw her standing there , bathed in the white light of the moon . Like a statue . Her face turned towards him .
