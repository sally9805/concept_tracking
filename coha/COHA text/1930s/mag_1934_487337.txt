In the Driftway E 4 VERY so often the front page of the metropolitan press is agitated by the story of another youthful genius . The latest one , an unnamed hero of seven whose intelligence quotient reaches the dizzy heights of 230 ? making Einstein look like a nincompoop with a mere 200 or so  --  is now pursuing his way through school in Brooklyn . When the Drifter reads , however , that the lad is kept in association with children of his own age  --  in spite of the fact that he taught himself to read at two and has demonstrated an astonishing skill at mathematical calculation  --  he reflects that the life of the child prodigy is changing , and one can not doubt for the better . The Brooklyn unknown is being treated at every possible point like any other child . If he insists on being a genius , it will be evidently without any help from his elders  --  and on his own account it is encouraging to note that when he began school he exhibited a tendency to burst into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . ONTRAST this modern prodigy with one of the most famous and most pathetic of all child wonders ? John Stuart Mill . Mill described his own education and did not seem to deplore it , which is very likely the most deplorable thing about it . He recounted , in his " Autobiography , " how he learned Greek at three , how at the same tender age his task for the evenings was arithmetic and for the mornings , in walks before breakfast with his father , he was obliged to relate the substance of the books he had read the day before . When he was as old as four he was reading Hume and Gibbon ; by seven he had read the first six Dialogues of Plato , in Greek of course ; in his eighth year he commenced Latin , not only learning it himself but teaching it to a younger sister ; and by the time he was twelve he had finished a good part of Vergil , much of Livy , Sallust , Ovid , Terence , Lucretius , Cicero , the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of Sophocles , Euripedes , and Aristophanes , and he had even embraced Aristotle 's " Rhetoric , " in addition , of course , to innumerable works of history  --  so that when he was ten or eleven he began writing a " History of the Roman Government " ? not to mention elementary geometry and algebra , and had made more or less unsuccessful stabs at calculus and other portions of higher mathematics . It is not recorded that the little boy burst into tears when he was beaten in a game , for the simple reason that he had no time for games . He was permitted no vacations , he learned no sports , he had no boy companions . His father , the mentor and disciplinarian of this stern regimen , would brook no nonsense about relaxation , although for his son 's lighter moments he did borrow  --  not owning them himself  --  the " Arabian Nights , " " Don Quixote , " and the " Popular Tales " of Maria Edgeworth. a result of this welter of learning at an early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books which nobody now reads , although one or two of them are worth reading , and to complete an eminently serious , although perhaps not too unhappy , life . He was not , in short , a genius , or even one of the great English writers . Indeed , the Drifter can not remember any of the great writers who was a child wonder , with the possible exception of Pope . This genius is a mysterious thing , compounded of natural talents , extraordinary curiosity , and great variety of experience . Nowadays educators with a prodigy on their hands are endeavoring to provide a well-rounded training instead of stuffing a young brain with more than it can digest . The Drifter has often suspected , indeed , that we have gone too far in this direction , and that we provide too many games and too little intellectual discipline , not only for our geniuses but for our ordinary children . But for little John Mill one 's heart is wrung . There must have been about two million parents who , reading of the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at their offspring and remarked more or less pugnaciously : " He may not be a genius but he 'll probably have a better time if he is n't . " To which statistics merely add that he has about as much chance as the child wonder of being a genius after all . THE DRIFTER
