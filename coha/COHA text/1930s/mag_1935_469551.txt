is a story which everyone in Europe and nearly everyone outside of Europe has heard at least once , and it is not a particularly funny story . To prove that its laughter is not Olympian I shall repeat it : A citizen , walking by the riverside , heard a desperate cry for help . A man was drowning . The citizen jumped in and dragged the man safely to shore . The dripping stranger assumed as Napoleonic a pose as he could under the circumstances and announced , " I am Mussolini ! " Then he added , " You have saved my life and shall be rewarded . Ask anything you wish and it shall be yours ! " The frightened hero did not hesitate . He knew exactly what he wanted . " I ask only one thing , " he said . " Do n't tell anyone it was I who saved you . " That is how it is told in Italy . The identical story appears in Bolshevik garb , with Stalin 's name in place of Mussolini 's , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drenching . But it remains a minor jest . Yet there are men and women to-day in Siberian exile , in German concentration camps , and on Italian penal islands because they could not resist the temptation of telling this story to someone who had probably heard it before , and within earshot of a patriotic informer . Hundreds of others are constantly risking their careers and their freedom for the mad joy oftelling it ? of thumbing their noses in parable at the keepers of their straitjacketed countries . Dangerous sport it is , and perhaps for that very reason more alluring . But wagging a finger of ridicule at the head men is definitely unhealthy . In Italy , Germany , and Russia alike l ? semaiestd ( which is called " counter-revolution " ) is a crime that brings swift punishment . Another tepid anecdote , which for the thrill of telling people seem willing to stake their liberty , is current with negligible variations under all three dictatorships . It recounts an occasion when the great leader ( Mussolini , Hitler , or Stalin , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the course of a newsreel his own image appeared on the screen . Instantly the audience launched an ovation . Everybody rose and cheered . Only the dictator himself remained seated . His neighbor thereupon poked him in the ribs . " You better stand up , my friend , " he said under his breath . " We all feel the way you do about it , but it 's not safe to show it . " That , too , has produced its quota of exiles in all dictated lands , though to an outsider its humor seems scarcely worth a major sacrifice . These are typical favorites in the repertory of jokes aimed at the exalted rulers , a sort of safety valve for the doubts and resentments and envies of otherwise meek subjects . Less exalted leaders also come in for their share of such spoofing . Every important event , every new policy or change in general conditions produces its complement of illicit , politically off-color jokes . Indeed , one of the curious bittersweet by-products of dictatorship in Europe to-day is the bootlegged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that flourishes in the shadows of secrecy and is watered by its own tears . Wherever democratic forms have been entirely destroyed the contraband stuff is passed from mouth to mouth , often in fear , always with misgivings . It is spread by the obedient disciples of dictated Causes no less than by their enemies and victims . For all of them it is the only intellectual escape under conditions of absolute suppression of free speech and press . Some of the humor is bold mockery of those in power , their foibles , and their pretensions . Much of it is subtle allegory , rich in overtones and multiple meanings . And all this stifled laughter is significant . Every story carries a hint of emotional and economic rebellion smoldering under the surface of appearances . The stories are usually a direct reflection of the harsh circumstances in which they were invented and disseminated . Social criticism which can not possibly be attempted outright finds an outlet in these anecdotes . Some are , in fact , so intimately related to local policies or events that only those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likewise prolific in such humor , and a considerable collection is said to be in existence in book form . An analogous collection for present-day Germany , Italy , or Russia would be a fascinating document . It would mirror aspects of life and sentiment beneath the statistics , slogans , and neat apologies of the various propaganda departments . Unfortunately the only extensive collections are in the possession of the Secret Service organizations , which show no desire to put them at the disposal of journalists . In Moscow the G.P.U . ( now the Commissariat for Internal Affairs ) has a special department to gather and record all sub-rasa jokes . An exhaustive treatise on current political humor must , therefore , be postponed . Here we can merely sample the raw materials out of which that treatise may be fashioned . I shall draw primarily on Germany and Russia , since these countries represent the two principal types of dictatorship , and because I am more familiar with their desperate , choked-up laughter than with the Italian and Austrian brands . The interest in this underground humor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I visited often while stationed in Moscow , I met Russians of all political shadings , from Communists on official missions to embittered emigres . Regardless of their political complexion , when they realized that I was fresh from the land of Soviets they sooner or later asked me the same question : " What are the latest anecdotes ? " And after the advent of Hitler I was confronted with the identical query by German emigres in places like Moscow , Vienna , or Paris . Germans and Russians alike betrayed a strange eagerness in their thirst for the political humor of de . hour , as though the stories conveyed to them , more effectively than mere facts and figures , a little of the authentic moods of their homelands . It was in a sense a manifestation of their nostalgia . Invariably I was able to contribute a few new ones to their happiness . They listened not alone with their winds but with their souls . The most recent anecdote seemed to them news from home more intimate in quality than anything else I could tell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impudent joke sticking a pin into the dictatorship is no less urgent . The telling , however , is far more circumspect and pleasantly suffused with the tang of forbidden fruit . At critical moments the charge of disseminating i'coun ter-revolutionary humor " may be brought against anyone who runs afoul of the new masters . Despite the risks there are people who collect these anecdotes as enthusiastically as others collect postage stamps or first editions . Like those other collectors , they are always willing to swap . They will give a dozen frayed and dog-eared jokes for a new one , or without any return at all , for the sheer pleasure of displaying their wealth . Like those other collectors , they are endlessly searching , burrowing , begging for additions to the stock . " Did you hear the one about .. . ? " is a conventional form of greeting for thousands who live their cramped lives under dictatorships . Nine times out of ten you have heard that one . The speed with which a new story sweeps through a nation is phenomenal . II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Union , or so similar that one wonders where they originated or whether they sprang into being independently and simultaneously in both countries . In both countries for instance it is now a common saying that the Jews have decided to disown Moses . " But why ? " the innocent bystander inquires , and is informed : " Because if Moses had not led them out of Egypt they would now be enjoying the protection of British passports . " In both countries likewise there are analogous anecdotes ridiculing the intense propaganda carried on by their press . The Soviet version runs approximately as follows : President Kalinin was making an impassioned speech in Moscow about the great economic progress of the Soviet land . With particular emphasis he described the brand new twenty-storey skyscrapers on Karl Marx Street in Kharkov . " Comrade Kalinin , " a worker in the audience rose na ? vely to correct the speaker . " I live in Kharkov . Every day almost I take a long walk on Karl Marx Street but I have never seen such skyscrapers ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kalinin shouted angrily . " You waste your time in promenading the streets instead of reading the newspapers and learning what is going on in your country . " The German variation on this theme is normally represented as a dialogue between Karl , the enthusiast for Nazi notions , and Otto , the skeptic . They are overheard as they walk along the waterfront in Hamburg : Karl : Is n't it marvelous what our Fiihrer has done in such a short time ! Look at the harbor , Otto , crowded with ships , and the docks crowded with goods . . . . Look at the thousands of happy sailors . Only yesterday , it seems , most of them were unemployed and hopeless . Now listen to them singing as they work . . . Is n't it wonderful ! Otto ( perplexed ) : But everything is deserted here . I ca n't see any ships or sailors and ca n't hear any singing . Karl : The trouble with you and other men of limited vision is that you do n't read the Nazi papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the first anecdotes I heard on arriving in Moscow in 1928 struck me as particularly sharp . It suggested forcibly the discontent and bitterness bottled up in the population by fear . In the following years I was obliged to listen to the story innumerable times , until it lost its satirical edge . But in 1934 it was proffered to me in a scared undertone in Berlin , with German rather than Soviet characters , and the transplantation somehow restored its cutting edge . Five ordinary Germans , I was told , were sitting in a crowded caf ? , each thinking his private thoughts about his private sorrows . One of them sighed lugubriously , another groaned aloud , a third shook his head in despair , a fourth choked down tears . The fifth , in a frightened voice , whispered : " But my friends , be careful ! How often have I told you not to discuss politics in public ! " The Soviet precursor of this sad joke usually places its protagonists in a crowded street car instead of a caf ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cud of their troubles in silence . The husband can not repress his feelings . " Oi .. . oi , .. oi .. . " he sighs aloud . The wife , nearly scared out of her wits , nudges him vigorously . " Ivan Petrovich , " she chides him , " how many times must I warn you not to talk counter-revolution in public ! " Another set of anecdotes roughly parallel in the two countries runs as follows : In Germany : A citizen is brought before the special court charged with having insulted the Hitler government . He denies all the allegations firmly . The Nazi prosecutor is enraged and addresses the Nazi judges : " Your Excellencies , witnesses have testified that this fellow used the expression ' scoundrels , incendiaries , and murderers . ' The accused himself does not deny having used these words . I ask you , Your Excellencies , whom else could he have referred to but our glorious Nazi re-gime ? " In Russia : Two men are engaged in conversation on a Moscow street corner . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This government , " he shouts , " consists of rascals and fools . It is starving the population and enslaving the peasants , and everything is going to rack and ruin ! " At that point a G.P.U . agent who overhears this outburst seizes the offender and begins to drag him off to headquarters . The man 's friend , wishing to save him , begins to argue with the agent . " But comrade , " he pleads , " do n't take this fellow so seriously . The man is crazy and not responsible for what he says . " The agent , however , is not to be caught by such a ruse . " Huh , " he snorts , " you want me to believe he 's crazy . do you ? But if he 's crazy how does it happen he understands the true political situation so perfectly ? " Corresponding conditions elsewhere produce similar ironic stories . Doubtless the Italians have some to match ? and in none of these countries is there the slightest awareness that similar anecdotes are being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontiers . But the great mass of this humor is profoundly local , mirroring situations and personalities and states of mind native to the spot . An outsider may understand them in the abstract and even enjoy their satire . But only those immersed in the realities that nurture this contraband humor , those who laugh at their own sorrows and deride their own taskmasters , can appreciate it in full measure . A story which may sound feeble to anyone unfamiliar with its setting acquires a poignant humor and pathos when the conditions under which the story arose are understood . Perhaps the most widely known and whispered piece of verbal contraband in Germany is the one which at one stroke deflates a batch of Nazi chieftains . It is recounted in many variations , one of which runs as follows : While digging for archaeological secrets , scientists discovered an interesting skeleton . It was blond like Hitler , slender like Goering , tall like Goebbels , virile like Schleicher . Nearby lay a collection box . The scientists instantly understood that they had unearthed a great treasure : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slender , tall , virile Aryan . ( Perspicacious readers will deduce , even if they did not know it , that Hitler is the opposite of blond , Goering the opposite of slender , etc . ) A runner-up in popularity , and probably the most dangerous one to air within the German borders , strikes out most unkindly at Hitler himself : A young Nazi , cocky in his brown uniform , thought he would have some fun with the Jewish delicatessen shopkeeper on his street . He entered the shop and demanded a Hitler herring . The proprietor was scared and astonished . He was very sorry , he apologized , but he had no such herring . " What ) No Hitler herring ! " the Nazi stormed . " This is an insult to the leader . I shall return this evening . If by that time you have no Hitler herrings for sale I 'll have your shop wrecked ! " He departed , chuckling . A few hours later , when he had quite forgotten his practical joke , he passed that shop again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have the Hitler herring for you , " he announced proudly . " You have ? But there is no such thing , " the Nazi said . " Yes , there is , " the delicatessen man insisted . " I made it myself . I simplytook a Bismarck herring , removed the brains and the backbone , and presto ! it became a Hitler herring ! " The opponents of Hitler at the outset of his triumph accused him of lacking a definite program of action . That circumstance provides the explanation for the following anecdote : Hitler entered a theater . In the darkness the usher did not recognize him . Hitler having been seated , the usher asked him in a whisper : " Have you got a program , sir ? " Whereat the Fiihrer shouted , " To the concentration camp with the impudent fellow ! " Another time , again according to humorous lore , Hitler was inspecting a State asylum for the insane . " Who is the funny little fellow with the Chaplin mustache ? " one of the inmates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know me ? " he asked , offended . " I am Adolf Hitler , the leader of the whole German race . " " Aha ! " the inmate said , " that 's how it started with me too . " Nor is Hitler the only target of these ironical shafts . The physical and psychological idiosyncrasies of his associates in power arc the focal points for cycles of jokes . Herr Goering 's notorious partiality for various and gaudy uniforms , Dr. Goebbels ' embarrassingly Semitic looks , the late President von Hindenburg 's supposed absentmindedness are all pegs on which to hang stories . The small , dark , sharp-featured Dr. Goebbels , arch enemy of Jews and director of Nazi propaganda , is referred to as " Wotan 's Mickey Mouse " and " Mahatma Propa-Gandhi . " His unAryan visage and physique stimulate stories like the following : An old Polish Jew appears before Hitler to present a petition . The Fiihrer is astonished by this visit and demands to know how the old man , Hebraic ear-curls and all , managed to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the end is obliged to confess : " I simply told the guards that I am the father of Herr Dr. Goebbels . " The same Goebbels was reporting on some subject to the aged President von Hindenburg . As he talked , the old general dozed off . Shaking himself out of the doze , a minute later , he looked at Goebbels and could not quite recall what it was all about . But nonchalantly he covered up his embarrassment . " I am sorry , my dear man , " he said . " Personally I feel very sympathetic , but I can do nothing , absolutely nothing , for your persecuted fellow-Jews . " Of General Goering and his love of uniforms it is told that his housekeeper once rushed to him excitedly with the news that a water-pipe had burst in the cellar and the house was being flooded . " Do come down and do something , Herr Goering , " the woman sobbed . Goering wrung his hands in despair . " I ca n't go down ! There is nothing I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " On another occasion , the stories have it , Hitler sat in the imperial box at the opera during a performance of " Lakengrin . " Wagner 's glorious knight , in the extravagant stage costume , went to the box between acts to pay his respects to the Fiihrer . He paused behind Hitler , getting up courage to address the great man . From the corner of his eye , however , Hitler caught a glimpse of the gaudily costumed person behind him in the half-darkness . " But , Goering , " Hitler whispered reprovingly , " this is really too much . . . " A more elaborate variation on this theme shows Goering , gorgeously uniformed and covered with orders andmedals , inspecting the fleet . Going through the flagship , he enters one of the cabins and sticks his head through a porthole . Sailors on another ship are discussing the number and variety of orders worn by Admiral Goering . Just then they see his head emerge through the porthole of the flagship . " Well , this is the limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's hung a battleship round his neck . " The supposed absentmindedness and servility of von Hindenburg in relation to his Nazi advisers are commemorated in a vast number of stories . There is the one for example in which a minor official comes to call on the President . Knowing that he will have to wait for hours , he brings along a sandwich wrapped in brown paper . After an hour or two he gets hungry , unpacks the sandwich , and begins munching it . At that moment von Hindenburg 's secretary comes out , looks round , and notices the brown wrapping paper on the table . He rushes excitedly to the waiting official . " Man alive , remove that paper , quick , " he yells . " His Excellency the President will he passing here in a moment and if he sees a paper on the table he 's sure to sign it . " The aged President 's dependence upon his advisers , especially upon Herr Meissner , was a godsend for political jokcsmiths . They told of Hindenburg 's arrival at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in surprise . " But Herr Field Marshal , " he said , " what are you doing here ? You have n't died yet . " " Really not ? " Hindenburg replies , peeved . " In that case that rascal Meissner misinformed me again . " Before his death Hindenburg is supposed by popular humor to have demanded to be taken for a tour through the concentration camps . " Before I depart , " he said , " I want to look once more upon the people who elected me President . " The richest supply of contraband humor , however , arises in Germany from the persecution of Jews by Nazi decrees , especially the unprecedented anti-Semitic policy of considering Germans with a single Jewish grandparent as non-Aryans . " Who is the best-beloved ancestor in Nazi Germany ? " a current riddle asks . The appropriate answer is : " A Jewish great-grandmother . She does n't spoil your Aryan status and brought money into the family . " On an anniversary of the Armistice Hitler is making a passionate speech about the War . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat . In the front row sits a man of unmistakably Semitic origin . He nods his head so vigorously in agreement with the speaker , that Hitler is pleased . " There , " he exclaims triumphantly , " even a Jew must agree with what I am saying . " Then , his curiosity aroused , he addresses the man . " Tell us , in what way was your race responsible for the German defeat ? " " Simple ! " the Jew answers . " There were too many Jewish officers . " " But you are mistaken , " says Hitler . " There were no Jewish officers in the German army . " " Aber nein ? I meant too many Jewish officers in the French and American armies , " the man corrects him . One day Hitler , wishing to probe the state of mind of the country , called a group of representative people before him . Among them was a learned rabbi . Those called vied with one another in eulogizing the Nazi system and its leader . Only the rabbi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you quiet ? What are you doing ? " the exasperated Hitler shouted at him . " Just thinking , " the rabbi replied quietly . " What are you thinking about ? " the F rth rer demanded . At first the rabbi refused to reveal his thoughts , but under pressure he spoke . " Well , Your Excellency , I was considering a weighty and interesting problem . Pharaoh was a terrible antiSemite . We Jews outlived him and his government , in remembrance of which we now eat unleavened bread , matzoth , on the Passover . Haman was also a terrible Jew-hater . He was hung , and in remembrance of it we Jews now eat a special Purim cake called hamantash . And now I am thinking what we shall eat in remembrance of you , Your Excellency . " The manner in which every new event produces its own crop of witticisms may be judged from the humorous reaction to the occurrences of June 30th , when the Hitler government killed a large number of recalcitrant Nazis . It happens that a tobacco company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarettes . These pictures are collected by boys , who play various games with them . After June 30th , it was said , a new game was devised . It was called " Living or dead ? " A card was laid face down on the table and the players guessed whether the man pictured on the card was still living or dead , the one guessing most being the winner . Growing economic distress netted this one : An unemployed worker , hungry and anxmic looking , pauses on a street corner and takes in another notch in his belt . A Nazi militiaman barks at him : " What are you doing ? " The worker looks at him sadly and answers : " Nothing , I 'm just having my breakfast . " While President of the Reichsbank , Herr Schacht is represented as conferring with American creditors , " You have nothing to fear , " he assures them . " Germany can meet all its obligations eventually . It is richer than you suppose , because it possesses two great treasures . It has coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above ground . " " The picture would be a lot more favorable , " an American is supposed to say , if the location of these treasures were reversed . " Hitler in the life to come is the subject of the following anecdote . Shortly after entering the gates of pearl he happens to meet Moses and accosts the patriarch of Israel with a shrewd smile : " Now tell me , just between ourselves . Did that burning bush really set itself on fire , or did you start it ? " IV The dressed-up revolution of the Soviet propaganda books is laid wide open to doubt by the multiplicity and sardonic bitterness of the political anecdotes which thrive under its , egis . The crop of jokes is the only crop that never fails . The anecdotes carry some suggestion of the hard , chaotic reality and , therefore , merit more than casual attention . At the same time they are not a transcript from life but at most a reflection of it in the distorted looking-glasses of popular satire and natural resentment against the hardships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionary leader until he settled down to comfortable orthodoxy , is generally credited with fathering scores of the political stories . Indeed , once by way of experiment I concocted a story myself . I told it to only three or four people to test whether and howfast it would circulate . In a few days my own story was being whispered to me , with embellishments , as " Radek 's latest . " That was sufficient proof that most of the other humorous tales attributed to his acrobatic mind did not originate there . But one at least I can vouch for as authentically Radek . I not only witnessed its birth but invested in a cable to transmit it to the American press . A day or two before the Soviet delegation was to leave for a Geneva disarmament conference , Radek , who was a delegate , appeared at an official party . He created a sensation by appearing minus his usual but very unusual fringe of beard . The facial alteration was the chief topic of conversation . " What 's the idea of removing your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he replied , " I am the only man who has made any real sacrifice for the cause of disarmament . " The shining mark for arrows of humor , naturally , is Joseph Stalin . A touch of arithmetical subtlety may be detected in this : " How many members are there on the Politburo ? " someone asks . ( The Politburo is the highest organ of power in the ruling Communist Party , headed by Stalin . ) " Ten , " the literal stooge replies . " All wrong , " comes the correction . " There are one billion members on the Politburo . " " What do you mean , a billion ? " " Quite simple : one ? and nine zeros . " A more elaborate story does double service . It not only stigmatizes Stalin 's immense authority but impugns the intelligence of some of his lieutenants . As told by good Soviet citizens the names of certain Commissars arc actually mentioned , but for purposes of this article fictitious names will serve equally well : A foreign delegation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after another . They find Commissar Semionov altogether charming and his answers quite satisfactory . Only one strange fact bothers them ? a huge spittoon stands right on the official desk . " Comrade Semionov , " a delegate inquires timidly , " I hope you will pardon my asking , but why do you keep that object on your desk ? " The question sends the commissar into a towering rage . " It 's my spittoon , " he yells , " and I put it where I please ! " In the offices of Commissar Rabinovich the visitors have a similar experience . Everything is in tip-top shape , but a chair is suspended from the ceiling . Before leaving a delegate ventures to ask about the strange location of the chair . But Commissar Rabinovich , too , blows up . " It 's my chair , " he storms , " and I put it where I please ! " Finally the delegation reaches Stalin himself . Everything proceeds excellently . The foreigners are convinced of the nobility of the experiment and the genius of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a delegate alludes to the strange behavior in certain commissariats ? a spittoon on the desk , a chair in the air . " Oh , just disregard them , " Stalin smiles . " Those men are idiots . " " But if they are idiots , " the delegate persists , " why are they at the head of commissariats ? " This sends Stalin into a fierce rage . " They 're my idiots , " he shouts , " and I put them where I please ! " The deep popular skepticism about the renowned Five Year Plans found voice ( though in discreet undertones ) in a steady flow of anecdote . Most of ? them had their day and faded out , but a few have remained in the permanent repertory . Of these the most widely circulated tells of a gentleman who boarded a train stark naked . With the utmost unconcern he sat down and unfolded a newspaper . His amazed fellow-passengers surrounded him and demanded to know the reason for his nudity . For a long minute the naked citizen could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light : " Oh , you are astonished by my costume ? " he said , innocently . " But there is nothing strange about it . I come from Tobolsk , comrades , where we have already finished our Five Year Plan . " The same theme , the acute shortage of clothes as the Plan gathered speed , serves for a no less celebrated item of contraband humor . Michael Kalinin , whose peasant quality makes him a suitable character for many of the stories , was discussing the Soviet situation with a group of peasants . They listened to his praise of the new system for a while , then began complaining about the lack of clothes . " You peasants put altogether too much importance on the matter of clothes , " Kalinin consoled them . " It really is n't as important as you think . Take the Hottentots for instance . They go entirely naked , or at most wear loin cloths , but they are no less happy for it , and they do n't complain . " " I suppose , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a Soviet government much longer than we . " A take-off on the vaunted " tempo " or rate of speed of the Plans , recounted in a dozen variations , runs thus : A Soviet agitator was having a hard time explaining the meaning of the word " tempo " to a visiting peasant delegation . He resorted to homely illustrations from the everyday life around him . " I 'll tell you what tempo is , " he said . " Let 's look out of the window . See that street car ? Well , before the revolution only one car passed here every hour , now there is one every five minutes . That 's tempo . " The peasants understood . Back in their village , one of them was reporting to a circle of his neighbors . He tried to explain " tempo " to them . " Let 's look out of the window , " he said . A funeral was passing at that moment . " See that ? ? a funeral ! " the peasant declaimed . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , we have one every hour . That 's Soviet tempo , my friends . " The revered Lenin is dragged from his granite mausoleum on Red Square , metaphorically speaking , to give point to another shaft at the famous Plan . The story recounts that Lenin left his tomb one night and sneaked into the Kremlin for a visit to his successor . " Well , friend Joseph , " Lenin said , " how are things going ? " Stalin was moved to boastfulness . " Oh , everything is perfectly lovely , " said he . " We have just finished the Five Year Plan and the people are with me . . . " " Another such Five Year Plan , " Lenin interrupted , " and all the people will be with me . " As progress in technical things began to pile up under the Plan , and goods , especially food , became ever scarcer , the two facts were translated in folk humor into a hyperbolic story . Looking into the future , the story foresaw the roads filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people chronically hungry . Two airplanes pause in their flight and the pilots exchange greetings . " Hello ! " Ivanov says , " where are you going ? " " I 'm rushing to Kiev , " Stepanov replies . " They say there are some herrings for sale there . . . . And where are you going ? " " I 'm on my way to Tashkent . I heard bread is only three rubles a loaf there . " The food shortage indeed was the most prolific breeder of political humor . The tale was told of a meeting to discuss the fight against prostitution . Everybody agreed that it must be stamped out . The sole remaining question was as to which was the proper government agency to undertake the job . Some suggested the Commissariat of Health , others of Education . No agreement could be reached on this matter until a wiser delegate arose . " Comrades , " he said , " I suggest that prostitution be turned over to the Commissariat of Supplies . Then it is sure to disappear . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everything else the Commissariat of Supplies controls . " At the moment when shortage was most acute and shop shelves most bare , it began to be whispered that the world 's largest department store was going up in Moscow . More remarkable than its size , however , was the fact that it would be operated by one man . " One man ? Extraordinary ! How will that he done ? " " Quite easily . He will stand at the entrance and shout at the top of his voice , ' There is nothing in this store , citizens , no use going inl ' " The quintessence of this mockery of the Plans , however , was a saying common at the launching of the Second Five Year Plan " At least , " it went , " there will be no third Five Year Plan . " The innocent who inquired why not was swiftly enlightened : " Because ten years is the longest term of punishment allowed under the Soviet laws . " The place occupied by the Jew in Germany , as special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union by the so-called " Nepman " ? a term used for private traders under the late New Economic Policy ( Nep ) . Outwardly these Nepmen conformed to the new regime and its ways , but under the surface they despised the Soviet order , which paid back in kind . One such Nepman passes Red Square with his young son . The boy sees Lenin 's tomb and wishes to know what it is . " That , my son , is the mausoleum of Lenin . " " Lenin ? Who is Lenin , daddy ? " " What ! You do n't know who Lenin is ? Why , he 's the man who freed us from our chains . You remember , mother 's nice gold chain and my thick watch chain . " Another of that clan was asked how he feels . " Well , " he says , " I feel exactly like street car number 17 . It runs up and back , up and back , between Liubianka Square where the G.P.U . headquarters is located and the Butirka prison for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he threw back the question . " I ? Why , I feel on board ship in the middle of the ocean . " " What do you mean by that ? " " I mean that everything nauseates me and there is no way out . " The third of these Nepmen explained that he , for one , feels like a moth . Asked why , he said : " I mean that I have already eaten up my winter coat and that I am now living on my wife 's sable collar . " The dreaded tax collector arrived at the home of a Nepman . A child received him . " Mother , " the child shouted toward an adjoining room , " the comrade tax collector is here . " " I 'll be right out , darling , " mother shouts back . " Give the comrade a chair . " " But mother , " the child informs her , " the comrade wants all the furniture . " From the endless stream of humor , I select a final sample . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet frontier into Poland . The surprised Polish officials stopped a rabbit leader and asked for an explanation of this panicky escape . " Did n't you know , " the rabbit said , " that the Soviets have passed a law that all camels must be caught and killed ? " " But you 're not camels , " the Polish officials said . " Yes , " the rabbit sneered , " a fine chance we would have proving that to the G.P.U . "
