NO TRAVELLER RETURNS-Joseph Auslander-Harper ( $2.50 ) . <P> Last week Joseph Auslander 's chief claim to newspaper fame was his wife . Audrey Wurdemann , who had just won the 1934 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry . The Pulitzer Prize has never come his way , but Poet Auslander has been poeticizing for years , is much better known than his newcomer wife . To some readers of his verse , it may even seem that he has been writing poetry since before he was born . His facile images and garrulous lines show versifying talent often , poetic mastery never . <P> Poet Auslander 's chief admiration is John Masefield , whom he calls " The Master Poet . . . . This High Priest of the Commonplace , " but unlike Masefield he himself is a lyric , not to say a complaining , poet : <P> Yet do you mark how much I go alone ? <P> And can you know how like a heavy stone <P> My heart is and how little I delight <P> In man or woman : and is this thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human irritations : <P> I know what I know- <P> People are not everything- <P> God , how the willows glow <P> This spring ! <P> In lines only vaguely reminiscent of the late James Elroy Flecker he pours his scorn on effete modern poets , no better than sissies : <P> We who were prophets and priest-men <P> For the Kings of the East and the East-men , <P> The bugles of God to the beast-men , <P> His terrible seal on our brow- <P> Physicians of music and makers <P> Of language and law and the breakers <P> Of battle , strength-lifters , heart-shakers- <P> We are nice poets now . <P> Readers of Poet Auslander and his kind will heartily agree .
