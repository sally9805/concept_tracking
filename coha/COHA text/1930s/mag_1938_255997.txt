" As a last resort in a desperate situation , " Wendell Willkie , president of vast Commonwealth &; Southern Corp . and sometime spokesman for the utility industry , five months ago proposed to Franklin Roosevelt that the Government buy up his utilities in TVA territory . What makes the utility situation seem desperate to such men as Wendell Willkie are two New Deal policies : 1 ) direct competition with the utilities through such projects as TVA and Bonneville Dam ; 2 ) abolition of all except geographically integrated utility pyramids , which is a main feature of the Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 . Result has been the bitterest of all the battles between Franklin Roosevelt and Big Business and the loser has been the nation : instead of spending their normal $700,000,000 a year in expansion and replacement , the utilities have been getting along on $130,000,000 . When renewed Depression jabbed this point home to the President last fall there was a sudden splash of headlines about a utility truce . It failed to come off . Last week there was another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settling both major differences . <P> Offer . In 1934 Tennessee Public Service Co. , a $20,000,000 utility in Knoxville , decided to sell out to TVA . Bickerings have gone on ever since with no results . Last week TVA and the city of Knoxville joined in offering $7,500,000 for most of the electrical properties of the company , a million and a quarter more than the previous offer . Simultaneously , TVA Director David Lilienthal let it be known that TVA may limit sales of its power to a definite area , that it was considering buying up Commonwealth &; Southern 's private lineage in this territory . Apparently all that remained was for Wendell Willkie and David Lilienthal , who call each other by their first names , to work out terms . <P> Note . Broker Paul Shields , pleased with his success in being " the man behind " the reform of the New York Stock Exchange ( see p. 51 ) , several weeks ago set out to do as much for the utilities . He invited Wendell Willkie , Chairman C. E. Groesbeck of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North American Co. to lunch , proposed that a neutral board of tycoons act as umpires in the battle against the Holding Company Act . Wendell Willkie objected and there was something of a row . The utility magnates wound up by having a conference with SEC Chairman William Douglas , then writing him a cordial note to say they had appointed a committee of five " to cooperate with the Commission in endeavoring to bring about sound and constructive solutions of the problems . ... " <P> President Roosevelt promptly remarked that he was glad to hear of this olive branch and Bill Douglas , making his first comment since the Supreme Court upheld the registration provision of the Holding Company Act last month , declared in Electrical World : " We do not expect every utility system to present us immediately with a revised map showing revamped , integrated systems . Nor do we propose to draw such a map . ... the statute is not a ' death sentence . ' On the contrary it holds the promise of a long life and a happy one . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing at all times to advise and help the industry in working out its problems and to conduct ourselves reasonably and practically . . . . "
