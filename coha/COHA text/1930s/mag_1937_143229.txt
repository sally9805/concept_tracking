Divo Doubted <P> Sirs : <P> We think TIME was right in doubting the story of Mr. Miguel Divo which was reported in TIME , Oct. 11 under Transport . <P> This Gentleman turned up in Barranquilla in late July 1936 with his then Model T Sedan , and two pals . We learned that he had crossed Colombia , from Ecuador on excellent highways as far as the upper Magdalena River , from where his conveyance floated down the River on a very comfortable steamer for approximately 900 kilometers , landing him in Barranquilla , where he covered several of his kilometers on concrete city streets . <P> The photos attached , show him with us in Barranquilla . Mr. Divo is on the right side of the picture with the writer and a donkey , which may be the one we refer to later on . <P> Mr. Divo left here according to official customs information on Aug. 3 for Panama . <P> The ' ' 300 ' impenetrable ' miles " from Barranquilla to Panama were covered by compass only-true-and he " hacked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford ( in pieces ? ) on the very sizable " mule " Lloyd 's registered S. S. Venezuela of the Royal Netherlands Steamship Co . <P> The second companion " under a small wooden cross " must have jumped overboard before reaching Panama in order to have his funeral in the woods of Darien . <P> We hope this letter clears up some of your doubts . . . . <P> HENRY E. METRAL Barranquilla , Colombia <P> Sirs : <P> Seor Divo was in Panama City during the month of September 1936 and at that time arrangements were made for his continued use of Essolube Motor Oil for the Northern lap of his trip from Buenos Aires to New York . From this point contact was made with our representatives in San Jose , Managua , Tegucigalpa , San Salvador and Guatemala City requesting that the proper courtesies be extended upon his arrival . The Huasteca Petroleum Co. of Mexico was also notified with the request that they in turn contact associate companies across the U. S. border . We , therefore , were most interested in reading of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in TIME . <P> We realize that you will undoubtedly receive numerous letters expressing both amazement and doubt as to the overland trip from Colombia to Panama through this comparatively unexplored and almost impenetrable jungle . We , therefore , take this opportunity to reassure all such scribes . We have records to show that the pack train was serviced all the way with axle grease and the latest in horse shoes by our service stations , which same extend in an unbroken chain all the way from the Colombian border to Panama City ( ? ) . No doubt but that the trail blazed by Seor Divo is the forerunner of the Pan-American Highway through this jungle and we wish to announce that our Service Stations have gained a decided jump on the engineers by moving in prior to the survey of the road ( ? ) . . . . <P> E. H. ARRINGTON S. J. ALFORO D. W. RAMSEY C. I. LANGDON West India Oil Co . Panama , R. P. <P> Leering <P> Sirs : <P> In catching up on my TIME reading , I came across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of Helen Wills Moody . <P> Besides being a " relentless careerist , " Mrs. Moody was one of those rare persons in the sports world who never permitted the newspapers to make a fool of her .
