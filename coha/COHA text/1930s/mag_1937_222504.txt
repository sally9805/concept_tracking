While the Cinema has been growing up as industry and art , the movie press has signally failed to keep pace with it . That the Cinema deserved , and the literate portion of its U. S. public would welcome , something more than tradepapers , highbrow snippets and vulgar fan magazines , has long seemed obvious . This week on U. S. newsstands appeared 52,000 copies of the first substantial effort to supply this demand . It was Cinema Arts , a FORTUNE-sized , 50 , slick-paper magazine , published by Albert Griffith-Grey , younger brother of the oldtime cinema director , David Wark Griffith . <P> Cinema , Arts will " attempt to do for the Cinema what FORTUNE has done for Industry . " Its credo is " That . . . more than any other form of art expression , the Cinema reflects and interprets the changing moods , fashions and philosophies of the times . " Its hope is " to ' freeze ' on paper something of the fleeting beauty of the films . . . . " That Cinema Arts ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was debatable . Much of what it had frozen on its 90 pages , well-cushioned with advertising at both ends , was routine press agent photography . But the textual interpretations of current U. S. moods , fashions and philosophies as seen in the Cinema , were impressive . Critic Richard Watts Jr. , Director Rouben Mamoulian , Author Jim Tully , Singer Mary Garden , Scenarist Homer Croy contributed . <P> Cinema-Arts ' editor is Paul Husserl , onetime script editor for the cine-MARCH OF TIME . Following the current vogue , Editor Husserl packed his first issue with many more pictures than paragraphs , hired four artists , most notably Jaro Fabry , to illuminate what interstices were left between photographs and text . Best shots : a full page of Henry Armetta titled " Portrait of Expostulation " and " Double Feature , " a photograph of a Manhattan theatre marquee advertising Romeo &; Juliet and Mama Steps Out . <P> The future of Cinema Arts will depend heavily on how its backers fare with an issue of 170,000 shares of stock at $2 a share , subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William J. Mericka &; Co. this week . Publisher Griffith-Grey - who enlarged his name in 1915 to avoid being confused with his famed brother , for whom he used to distribute pictures like Broken Blossoms , Intolerance , The Birth of a Nation-determined 18 months ago to get out Cinema Arts . Last autumn he startled the magazine world with the biggest dummy ever seen in the U. S. , a book 14 by 17 in. , of which 12,000 copies were distributed in the U. S. and England . Despite enthusiastic response from advertisers , who welcomed its display opportunities , the magazine was whittled down before publication to 11 by 14 in. , to make it manageable on newsstands . The first issue represented an investment of about $100.000 . Best augury for its success last week was news of two competitors . Stage advertised a July issue completely devoted to the Cinema . Forthcoming is another high-class cinemagazine , Cinema Preview , to be published in San Francisco .                    @
