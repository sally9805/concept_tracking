txt Sir George Julius , engineer and inventor , at present chairman of the Commonwealth Bureau of Scientific and Industrial Research , and president of the Sydney Rotary Club , has constructed a Model Mechanical Township in the grounds of his home on the shore of Sydney Harbor . It has taken Sir George 12 years to build the Model City , with the aid of his sons and for the purpose of training his boys for an engineering career . It is Sir George 's pet hobby and periodically the City is thrown open to public , inspection , the proceeds going to the aid of some charity . The Model City Is a perfect miniature township with railways , parks , a lake , a windmill , a coal mine , mountains , grottoes , gardens and farms on the outskirts . There are electric railway lines over which the regular electric trains run  --  third rail system  --  and a danger signal automatically ) stops any train which attempts to over-run it The Dahl service covers the whole area from the lower front up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it climbs the mountain . From the lake on the right in which a motorboat runs , , water is pumped by an electrically driven rotary pump to the reservoir on the high pound above for the general service of the township . The water may be seen pouring into the reservoir and there is a gauge at the side to indicate the amount of water contained therein The whole village is illuminated electrically , at night , by street lamps of modern design . Houses and station buildings are similarly lit , and there is a revolving light in the lighthouse by the lake side . In the foreground are seen cattle , horses , pigs , sheep dogs , a plowman turning a furrow , a blaclvnith 's shop , and a milkmaid . There are motorcycles on the road , hay wagons and farmers ' carts and all kinds of wild animals on the hills which are patrolled by the guard on either side of the village .
