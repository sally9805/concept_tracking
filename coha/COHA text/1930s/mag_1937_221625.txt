When Composer Henri Rabaud made an opera out of the 959th of the 1,001 Arabian Nights , he clothed it in music gay , elaborate and Oriental . The fact that parts of it recall Rimsky-Korsakov never seemed to matter . A good-natured plot and attractive sets helped make Marouf popular at the Paris Opera-Comique . The opera had eleven performances at the New York Metropolitan between 1917 and 1920 . Though Composer Rabaud meant his lead to be a tenor , Baritone Giuseppe de Luca always sang the role at the Metropolitan . Last week the spring company resurrected Marouf and put it on in English . As lead , they had not only a tenor but the tenor whom Rabaud considers made for the part . <P> Mario Chamlee ( Archer Ragland Cholmondeley ) has given almost 100 impersonations of Marouf , the cobbler who runs away from his nagging wife , pretends to be a rich merchant , makes a monkey of the Sultan of Khaitan and marries the Sultan 's daughter . Chamlee first took the part nine years ago at Ravinia Park ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lille and Brussels . When he arrived to sing his first Marouf in Paris , Composer Rabaud kept him up till 3 a.m. going over the score , called him a " delicious interpreter . " <P> At last week 's Marouf Tenor Chamlee showed the agreeable voice and the discreet musicianship people expect of him . Norman Cordon was comical as the suspicious , crack-voiced vizier . Pretty Nancy McCord , who used to sing in Broadway shows , made her Metropolitan debut as Princess Saamcheddine . She hit the proper notes , but acted woodenly and could not hide the fact that she has a pale , uninteresting voice . Listeners felt that the Metropolitan 's Marouf was well worth repeating , but could not come up to last season 's smash hit in English , The Bartered Bride .
