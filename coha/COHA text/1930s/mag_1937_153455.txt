From Haifa to Jerusalem one day last week , pious Jews of all degrees turned out in a heavy rain to welcome to the Holy Land a sharp-eyed , black-bearded man just arrived from Europe . He was Dr. Isaac Herzog , 48 , elected by a modern Sanhedrin or council of 70 Jewish elders to be Chief Rabbi of the Ashkenazic community of Palestine succeeding the late Dr. Abraham Kook . <P> Unlike U. S. Jews , some European congregations elect a man of learning , not necessarily a native , to head their national community . Because Judaism is congregational rather than hierarchical , he lays down no law , chiefly presides over religious courts and ceremonials . Son of a rabbi who used to head the Russian-Polish Jewish community in Paris , Isaac Herzog went to London University , became a rabbi in 1910 . First the Jews of Belfast , then those of Dublin , chose him their leader . In 1925 he became Chief Rabbi of the 3,686 Jews of the Irish Free State , liked the post well enough to decline the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Erudite not only in Hebrew , but in modern tongues and mathematics , Rabbi Herzog is at work on a five-volume work , The Main Institutions of Jewish Law . To Palestine his arrival signalized perhaps smoother relations with the Mandatory Power . He is an old friend of the British High Commissioner , General Sir Arthur Grenfell Wauchope . In a statement which made good reading for Jews and could not possibly irritate goyim he declared : <P> " The wonderful preservation of the ' people of the Book ' is a great , living proof of Divine Providence in this world , and , prophetically interpreted , the rebuilding of the Jewish national home after many centuries of desolation means that a people that has already given so much to civilization is now called on to rekindle the light of God in the Holy Land , link the East and West and send forth new waves of light-religious , ethical and cultural- to all mankind .
