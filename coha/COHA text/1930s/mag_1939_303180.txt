THE HORSE THAT COULD WHISTLE " DIXIE " - Jerome Weidman-Simon &; Schuster ( $2.50 ) . <P> Few months ago a report went around that Jerome Weidman 's two novels , I Can Get It For You Wholesale and What 's In It For Me ? , were being withdrawn from circulation . The circumstances were unusual . Reviewers had praised them , ranked Weidman with such sourball writers as John O'Hara , James M. Cain , Hemingway . But Weidman 's Semitic hero was such a heel that he roused antiSemitism . Author Weidman , and many a reader , regarded his villainous Harry Bogen as a deliberately horrible example . Publishers Simon &; Schuster denied the report , announced that they were selling 100 copies a month of the books . <P> Last week they brought out a big collection of Author Weidman 's short stories , The Horse That Could Whistle " Dixie . " Published in a wide variety of magazines over the past five years , these 28 stories will not add much to Author Weidman 's strong reputation with friendly readers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-appointed censors . The majority deal with the Manhattan East Siders he grew up with , including a few embryo Harry Bogens , but a good number show that Author Weidman 's range , human and geographical , goes well beyond the East Side , that his sympathies can be as warm as his satire is cold .
