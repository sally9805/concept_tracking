From Los Angeles to Bakersfield , Calif , stretches the Ridge Route , a treacherous ribbon of curves and grades famed both for its scenery and its danger . After 51 motorists had been killed on Ridge Route in 15 months , Chief E. Raymond Cato of the California Highway Patrol decided on an ingenious method to cancel the carnage , put it into effect last week on a 62-mile section of the Ridge Route from Castaic Junction to Arvin Road . <P> As automobiles ( about 180 per hour on weekdays ) reach this section , they are halted by police for a rigorous inspection of tires , brakes , lights , windshield wipers , mirrors , signal devices , loads . The driver is inspected for sobriety . Those who are let through are given a card stamped with the time of discharge and stating that the speed limit is 45 m. p. h . At the other end of the section another officer collects the ticket , notes by the elapsed time whether the driver has been speeding . If so , he is given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his license . ( By law police can not arrest the driver for an offense so detected . ) <P> First week 's results : average driving speed reduced 10 m. p. h. , only one minor accident .
