Angry Arizona lost its big and probably ' final chance to block construction of Hoover ( Boulder ) Dam last week . The Supreme Court dismissed Arizona 's suit to enjoin California , Utah , Nevada , New Mexico , Colorado , Wyoming and the Federal Government from undertaking this enterprise as a trespass on its sovereign rights ( TIME , Oct. 27 ) . Ruling that Arizona 's rights were not injured by the project , Mr. Justice Brandeis declared : ' ' As the Colorado River is navigable and the means which the act provides are not unrelated to the control of navigation , the erection and maintenance of such a dam and reservoir are clearly within the powers conferred upon Congress . Whether the particular structures proposed are reasonably necessary is not for this court to determine . ... It is clear we can not question the motives of Congress . "
