At Moscow occurred last week an extraordinary change in Government . It was as if in Washington Attorney General Homer S. Cummings had abruptly been created " Cabinet-Minister-General , " with six bureau chiefs of the Department of Justice becoming " **30;7164;TOOLONG Rank . " Such a change in Washington would mean that U. S. citizens were being handed over to be governed by G-men . <P> In Russia the Soviet secret service has had a long and fascinating history , increasing in respectability with the years . Members of the dread Tsarist Okhrana were remarkably successful in insinuating themselves into the Cheka of Lenin which conducted the original so-called " Red Terror . " So odious did the Cheka become that it was finally supposed to have been purged of its baser elements and was renamed the Ogpu . Under the late great Felix Dzerzhinsky , an extremely able and somewhat sadistic Pole , the Ogpu became internationally odious but in Russia it saved the Bolshevik Dictatorship from being overthrown by popular and democratic elements . That Arch-Terrorist Dzerzhinsky had deserved well of Bolshevism was signalized after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leningrad and London was named the S. S. Felix Dzerzhinsky.
