txt // extent , beyond the tactical radius of aircraft . Modern bombers require expensive and elaborate bases , which are not everywhere available and can not readily be improvised . The employment of bombing aircraft is therefore much affected by the peacetime location of bases vis-a-vis suitable targets ; and the national air strategy of any power is further affected by the location of the enemy bases vis-a-vis targets in its own domains . For example , in a Russo-Japanese war , a tremendous advantage would inhere to the Russians , because so many of the vital centers of Japan can be reached by Russian aircraft based in the Maritime Province , whereas the really vital centers of Russia itself are far away in Europe , well out of reach of Japanese aviation . The centers of the Far Eastern region are proportionately of infinitesimal importance to Russia , compared to the importance of Tokyo and Osaka to Japan .

The speed of aircraft has , as with warships , both tactical and strategical aspects . In contests between opposing groups of pursuit aviation , superior speed and maneuverability give great advantages to their possessors . But the principal tactical interest in aircraft speed is the contest between pursuit plane and bomber . During the World War , the former had an overwhelming advantage in this respect . Today the gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its first effort is not likely to get a second chance . In maneuverability , // however , the pursuit plane still retains first place . Strategically , the speed of aircraft is of principal importance as being , in the words of Liddell Hart , " the handmaid of surprise . " " An air force , " observes Air Commodore Charlton , " is always ready , like a bent bow , " and the speed with which it can strike enables its initial strokes to come literally as bolts from the blue . Ever since . the coming of conscript armies , the " nation-in-arms " conception , it had been impossible to effect strategical surprise on land in Europe , because of the immensity of effort and the great length of time required to mobilize the huge forces of continental powers . Air power has restored strategical surprise to the list of possibilities . Speed also conduces to flexibility , by enabling the same forces to strike blows in rapid succession at a variety of targets . The limitations of air power are numerous . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this has of late been greatly reduced ) , the vulnerability of the individual airplane , the great and growing // need of an elaborate ground organization ( requiring ground defenses ) , and inability to defend itself save when in flight . But certainly the chief limitation of air power is the limitation of time of flight , which , accompanied by limitations of range and carrying power , makes difficult any continuity of action and deprives air power of the ability to take and hold ground , or to maintain continual dominance of land or sea areas at any great distance from its bases . Unless , therefore , decisive success may be achieved by bombing a civilian population into surrender , the successes achieved by air power must be confirmed and exploited by surface forces ; and it is this which causes some authorities to contend that air power is really only an auxiliary to surface forces . This contention is perfectly sound as long as one considers only the older forms of war . Air power may be a powerful component of , and aid to surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a struggle between armies or navies . It must remain a part of the team , to be coordinated with the other fighting ele1-4 BOMBS BURSTING IN AIR ments under the command of a single leader . In land warfare , while the destruction of the enemy 's armed forces is the primary object , the taking and holding of positions is generally essential to successful operations , and this aircraft can not do alone , though they can greatly aid other arms to do so . Sea warfare is a matter of the control of sea-communications , which aircraft can do only intermittently , and in particularly favorable locations ; though again they may be a powerful aid to naval forces . These facts have their effect upon organization , since the army and the navy will always require a certain number of aircraft assigned to them for purposes of direct cooperation ; without such an air force , either would be fatally handicapped . But there trust also be an air force available for strategical missions , for the independent air operations appropriate to the peculiar qualities of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force will vary in proportion to the opportunities which the geographical conditions of each country and its neighbors appear to afford for its employment . What is quite clear from these considerations // is that air power can be decisive in war , if at all , only by its own special means , by that direct attack upon the civil population or vital centers of an enemy which it is able to achieve by reason of its peculiar qualities . Whether it can actually gain a decision in this manner or not , is a question as yet undetermined . Whether any great power would actually so employ it or not , is also undetermined . Its use in this manner will certainly be limited by the defensive means available against it . There are three forms which defense against direct air attack may take , aside from reprisal in kind : ( I ) Ground defenses , i.e. , anti-aircraft artillery and machine guns , searchlights , rockets , balloon barrages , detector apparatus . ( 1 ) Air defenses , i.e. , pursuit aviation . ( 3 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection of the civil population from air bombardment , including shelters , firefighting preparations , air-raid discipline , evacuation measures , and the like . As to any given point or area to be protected , // ground defenses are usually coordinated under a single command , which may or may not also include the control of pursuit aviation allotted to that area . Anti-aircraft weapons have very greatly improved since the World War , especially in the methods of detection and fire-control ; and while aircraft speeds have also increased , adding to the difficulties of the anti-aircraft gunner , the vulnerability of individual aircraft to the effect of artillery fire has not been greatly altered . It has not proved practicable to add the weight of armor to the wing-load even of the largest bombers ; a single anti-aircraft shell , even a small one , can disable the largest plane today , just as it could in 1918 . Anti-aircraft fire will be effective , however , directly in proportion to the depth of the defense . Anti-aircraft defense , like all other forms of defense , requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where there is little or no warning of approaching bombers , as in a seacoast position , anti-aircraft fire is seriously handicapped . Similar considerations apply to the use of // pursuit aviation ? there must be a warning period , to enable the alarm to be sent to the squadrons , the personnel to get their orders and run to their planes , even if these are already out on the field ready to take off , and to get into the air , locate the enemy , and attack him . Air raid precautions , if properly organized and equipped , can do a great deal toward saving lives and preventing panic among civilian populations . Effective service of this sort requires plenty of trained personnel , a complete organization in time of peace , and a thorough study of the precise measures to be taken as to each particular locality . In some cases evacuation is the only remedy ; in others , properly constructed shelters . Attention must be paid to the need for carrying on essential services , and for the continuous operation so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , industrial and political life of such a center as London , for example , can be brought to a stop by air raids , the attacker will have won his victory whether or not a single person is killed by his bombs . Paralysis resulting from forced inactivity , and // paralysis resulting from slaughter and destruction , are likely to be equally disastrous so far as losing the war is concerned . All this , however , is very largely speculation , based on the limited and partial experience now available to us . Indeed , one further limitation of air power not often dwelt upon is the lack of experience in its use . The idea of the strategical employment of air forces was in its infancy when the World War came to an end . Subsequent wars have been more helpful in tactical than in strategical lessons . In Ethiopia the Italians had little air opposition ; the same may be said of the Japanese in China . In Spain no great air forces have been employed , and the tendency has been to use the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in true air force strategical missions . There have been many air bombardments of cities ; Madrid and Barcelona , especially , have been subjected to this form of attack , and on the whole no very great results have been achieved . It is , however , true that the scale of attack which has been used is nothing like // that which might obtain in a war between first-class European powers ; hence , the experience of Spain must be accepted with some reserve . Perhaps its chief value is as a restraining influence both on the claims of air enthusiasts who conceived air power as having made all other means of warfare obsolete , and on the assertions of those who tended too greatly to discount its potentialities . The one instance in which there was true continuity of effort in air raiding ? the series of raids on Barcelona in March , 1938 ? presented certain very disquieting phenomena , which will hereinafter be examined in greater detail . Certain it is that the true measure of air power as a means of waging war lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can only strive to draw aside that veil a little , to apply such of the lessons of the past as seem pertinent , to reinforce them with technical data now available ; our forecasts can not be wholly accurate , much less complete . 3 : THE ELEMENTS OF AIR SUPERIORITY THE conditions and chances of modern warfare may not be weighed , so far as the air weapon is concerned , merely by adding up the airplanes and air personnel available to each of the prospective combatants . There are too many other considerations ? notably those of geography ? which enter into such assessments , for numbers alone to be determinative . There is , in fact , as between great powers , no such thing as " the command of the air , " a phrase which has been rather loosely used by some commentators on future warfare . The air is too great a battlefield for it to be " commanded " in any true sense by mere superiority of numbers of airplanes . Superior technique may count for something , but again , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a degree of superiority as to confer command . We may , however , speak of " air superiority , " or " preponderance of air power . " Such 31 // preponderance , in a war of any length , is likely to be only local and temporary . It may occur at the beginning of the war due to superior numbers of planes initially available to one combatant , and may be made up later by an increasing output by the weaker side . It may be achieved by fighting , reducing the numbers of the less successful side or impairing the morale of its flying personnel . An existing superiority may be swiftly reversed by the appearance of a superior type of plane on the other side , as was frequently the case during the World War ; or by tactical or technical changes , such as the development of the synchronizing device and of formation flying during the same conflict . A belligerent power may enjoy air superiority in one theater , and not in another ; as Germany , if engaged in a war with France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia on the other , might be able to produce air superiority on one front only at the cost of abandoning it on the other . The intangible factors of efficiency ? the human factors ? can hardly be measured at all in time of peace . At best they are matters of // opinion . A great deal depends on experience , the result of long practice in training and development which produces smooth administration , a well-rounded tactical doctrine , and the thousand little fibers which weave themselves into the fabric of that greatest military intangible of all , for which there is no English word but which the French call esprit de corps . In these matters , there can be no doubt that the new German air force , which began its official existence only in 1935 , is at a considerable disadvantage as regards the older air forces of the world . Technical efficiency ? the training of flying and ground personnel in their duties ? is another matter , not unconnected with the intangibles , but capable of attainment in a shorter time . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a great deal to choose in this respect ; though it must be pointed out that a rapidly expanding air force is likely to " cut corners " in matters of training in order to bring up its numbers to the standard desired within the shortest possible period of time . There is little doubt that the Germans and // British both have done this , the Germans perhaps to a greater extent than the British . The number of military airplanes available to the great powers of the world has been the subject of considerable discussion ? some of it in the realm of pure fantasy ? in the public prints of recent months . In order to arrive at any reasoned judgment , it is necessary first of all to know what sort of numbers one is talking about . When it is stated that such a country has , say , Io , 000 military planes , what is meant by that ? Does it mean that there are Io , 000 modern planes in operating squadrons , complete with all the necessary personnel and equipment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any foe ? Or does it mean that there are a total of Io , 000 modern planes available to that air force , partly in operating squadrons , partly in a reserve to make up losses ? Or does it include all the military planes , modern and obsolete , which could possibly be scraped together by counting everything that can fly ? Here again there will arise some discussion // as to what is a modern plane , and what an obsolete one . A plane may have a rather low standard of performance according to the criteria established by the latest model of its general type , and yet it may still be of considerable use for some purposes . Indeed , if the rate of loss among the newer types , in the early weeks of any war , is as high as some air staffs foresee , both sides may find themselves falling back on the " old crates , " and be thankful to have them . In order , therefore , to use numbers of planes as any criterion of air strength , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ( I ) First-line planes in operating squadrons . ( This is the air force which is immediately ready for use at the outbreak of war , and should include such reserve squadrons as may be maintained with full or partial quotas of planes and sufficient personnel ; although all of the latter may not be in full-time active service , as in the British Auxiliary Air Force , or our own National Guard observation squadrons. ) // ( z ) First-line reserve . ( This includes the reasonably modern planes immediately available to fill war losses in the first-line air force ; it is a replacement reserve , and its purpose is to take up the slack between the outbreak of hostilities and the time when the airplane industry of the country can be speeded up to war production levels. ) ( 3 ) Second-line reserve . ( These are older planes which would be used only in emergency , or for the accomplishment of special missions for which their age and inferior qualities would be little or no handicap . ) But this is not the last breakdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of types of airplanes . There are four general types ( exclusive of types pertaining solely to naval aviation ) : ( 1 ) Bombardment ( z ) Pursuit ( Fighter ) ( 3 ) Attack ( 4 ) Observation or Reconnaissance Bombardment aviation is the infantry of the air ; its mission is generally determinative of the whole air force mission , as far as strateTHE // gical objectives are concerned . It is the longrange striking arm , and it is of course the only air weapon which can act decisively in the sense of an attack on civilian centers . Pursuit aviation is the foe of bombardment . It exists for the single purpose of air combat . It is sometimes called " indirect aviation " because it alone does not act directly against ground objectives ( save in emergencies ) but has as its objective only enemy airplanes in flight . Attack aviation is specially designed for action against personnel targets and light material targets on the ground . It came into great prominence during the Spanish war as an arm of close support for attacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take place just as the artillery concentration lifted for the last time to permit the infantry to deliver its final assault . Such a use of attack aviation can hamper the enemy machine-gunners in coming out of their deep shelters to take up firing positions , and appears , on the experience of Spain , to have gone a long way toward solving the vexed problem // of close support . Marching columns , especially truck columns and artillery , are favorable targets for attack aviation , which may also be used in rear areas against concentration points , supply dumps , and similar objectives . Observation or reconnaissance aviation has a purpose fully explained by its title . It is usually attached to the units of ground troops which it serves ? armies , corps , sometimes even divisions . It may be employed on fighting missions in emergencies , and conversely any type of aviation may when necessary be employed on reconnaissance missions . Now it is clear that the proportion of the four types in any air force will affect the usefulness of that air force for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; thus Britain , with the defense of London as its primary problem , will require greater numbers of pursuit than Germany , which has a less acute defensive problem . It follows that if Britain is to carry out strategical ( bombardment ) missions to the same extent as Germany , she will need a considerably larger total air force to have equality in // bombing planes , plus her imperative super iority in pursuit . The following table shows the comparative air strengths of the principal European nations as of March 1 , 1939 . The figures have been compiled from sources considered reliable , and although they are not to be taken as absolutely accurate , they offer a reasonable approxima tion , at least , of the facts : The German first-line strength has a propor tion of bombers of approximately 65 per cent , // the Italian perhaps a little higher . The French have about 50 per cent , less rather than more ; the British formerly had about the same proportion as the Germans , but recent emphasis has been on pursuit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 55 per cent . A very high proportion of the Italian air force ( for geographical reasons ) consists of seaplanes or flying-boats . The Polish emphasis is heavily on pursuit ; the Russian , on bombers . It may be well here to add a few words about organization . The number of squadrons is sometimes used as an indication of air strength . This may be wholly misleading , as the number of planes in a squadron varies , according to type and according to national organization plans . Indeed , the English word " squadron " is variously translated by terms having different meanings in different countries . The general structure of air organization , however , follows fairly well-defined lines . The smallest flying organization is almost universally the number of planes which can be controlled by a single leader , varying from three to eight ; this in America and Britain is THE ELEMENTS OF AIR SUPERIORITY 4I called a ' flight . " Two or three flights compose what we call a squadron ; a squadron is the smallest administrative unit of the air force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel and equipment . From two to four squadrons , in our Army Air Corps , compose a group , and two or more groups form a wing , which is a general officer 's command and includes various administrative and maintenance elements . It is usual for a squadron to have two or three spare planes , known as " squadron reserve planes . " Squadrons always , and groups usually consist of the same general type of airplanes ? bombardment , pursuit , etc . A wing is usually composed of groups of varying types , just as a division includes infantry , artillery , engineers , and so on . The German organization is by threes , almost without exception ; three airplanes to a flight , three flights to a squadron , three squadrons to a group , three groups to a wing . The French organization is somewhat different and rather complicated ; the British is much like our own , save that the terms " wing " and " group " are transposed . Generally , save in Germany , the larger the // type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or squadron ; thus a squadron of heavy bombers in our Air Corps will have but eight planes , a pursuit squadron twenty-five . Even more than numbers , the industrial ability to produce planes is a factor of air strength . European air staffs consider it quite likely that the rate of loss in the first 30 days of a war would be from 6o per cent to 90 per cent of the planes employed . A hundred-per cent war reserve would therefore be used up in in from 66 to too days of fighting . Long before this happened , it would be necessary for industry to begin filling in the war losses , and if possible increasing the size of the air force . The shorter the war , the greater the importance of initial strength ; the longer the war , the greater the importance of replacement ability . Replacement ability depends on several factors : ( I ) Number and capacity of plants for manufacturing planes , engines and accessories . ( 2 ) Numbers and quality of skilled labor . // ( 3 ) Supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of designers . ( 5 ) Vulnerability , or otherwise , of main plants to hostile air action , or to capture by invading armies . In all of these except ( 3 ) , and possibly ( 4 ) , Germany holds first place in Europe ; her weakness is certainly in her lack of raw materials , and the possibility that in a future war she may again find herself blockaded by land and sea . The monthly airplane production capacity of the European nations is approximately as follows : // It will be noted that no attempt is being made to increase the normal production of Germany and Italy , which indicates that their air forces have reached their economical limit , beyond which there would be no point in increasing them in time of peace save to accumulate a great mass of obsolescing material ; unless , of course , these powers were building toward war at a prearranged date . On the other hand the most frantic efforts are being made to increase French and British production ; the former approximately doubled during the past year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coming year . One very important element of air power is a well-staffed and thoroughly efficient research organization . The value of this can not be overestimated . Aeronautical science is advancing by leaps and bounds . To fall behind , even temporarily , in the never-ceasing race for technical superiority may mean the difference between victory and defeat . The need is not only for improvement , but for foresight . As much as five years may elapse between the first design and the coming of a new type of airplane // into use in any numbers ; this period can be materially shortened , and has been in many instances , notably in Germany . But in any case the interval is a considerable one . Scientific foresight and military foresight must therefore march hand in hand ; the one determining the technical progress to be expected , the other forecasting the military needs which that progress will entail . Every dollar spent in research may save thousands of dollars in needless waste and obsolescence . Research is important to armies and navies ; to air forces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the principal elements of her present air superiority in Europe . Another element of air strength is ability to supply the needs of the air force in the way of fuel , lubricants , ammunition , spare parts , and stores . Here , especially as to fuel and lubricants , Germany is well behind Britain and France , to whom the sea-lanes would be open in war , and behind Russia , with her own supplies of petroleum . Next we must consider the matter of bases . // A modern air force requires many bases for the use of its planes ; a very different situation prevails today as compared with the World War , a difference which may be exemplified by comparing a cow-pasture with the thousand-yard concrete runway required by modern bombers . The larger and more complicated the airplane becomes , the greater the ground establishment it needs for its maintenance , and the less its strategical mobility . What is meant by the latter term may be understood by considering the ease with which a brigade of infantry may be dispatched from London to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for action as soon as it disembarked , and in default of barracks , could live under canvas for an indefinite period without injury to its efficiency ; whereas , to increase the air garrison of Egypt by a group of four bombardment squadrons , it would be necessary to send out an enormous quantity of machine-tools , equipment and supplies , and spend months in constructing a suitable base , hangars , machineshops , runways and all the rest of it . This is , of course , presuming that no base already constructed was available ; and it // indicates the need for constructing air bases in strategic locations , even though there may not be a full complement of airplanes stationed there in time of peace . The principle is the same as that which has led the British to build battleship docks at Singapore , though no British battleship has been on that station since the Singapore works were completed . Certainly a nation which possesses numerous and well-located bases within comfortable reach of its potential air objectives will have a great advantage over an enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underlining ? the necessity for their being adequately defended , both by anti-aircraft weapons against air attack , and by mobile troops and fortifications against surface attack . An air force can no more be required to defend its base without fatal restriction of its freedom of action , than a fleet can be required to do the same thing . Just as a naval base must have its coast batteries and the protection of a sufficient body of troops to guard it against landing forces , so must an air base be protected against all forms of attack which can reach it ; otherwise its value in war may be slight indeed . Worse , // it may be made a gift to an enemy who can turn it against its owner . The question of personnel is highly important . We have already considered efficiency ; the other two personnel factors in air strength are numbers and replacements . Numbers must include not only pilots , but pilots trained to fly the extremely complicated machines which are modern military airplanes , and proportionate to the types available in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curtiss pursuit job can not be transferred to the controls of a Boeing four-engine bomber . Other types of flying personnel , all highly trained for specialized tasks , must be provided ? navigators , observers , radionien , bombers , machine-gunners . The ground organization will require specialized mechanics in many lines , from machinists to carburetor repairmen , from electricians to sheet-metal workers . Engineer , medical , supply , armament and communications officers will be needed in large numbers . Above all , trained and experienced commanders and staff officers for squadrons , groups , wings and the higher echelons of command are of the first importance . // All these must be available in sufficient numbers for the first-line air force , and with a reserve to fill up the losses of war and to man any reserve formations that are intended to be mobilized . Behind this , as with the replacement of planes , must be a training reservoir capable of rapid expansion to maintain the air force at a level of full efficiency ; for if the losses in planes may be expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying personnel , while ground personnel will by no means have a claim on immortality . From all this , it will be readily perceived that it is by no means enough to say that Country A , possessing io , 000 planes , is ipso facto definitely superior in the air to Country B , which has only 7,500 . A great many other factors would have to be weighed in arriving at any such decision ; and even when that was done , a still more important factor would have to be taken into account ? geography . So definitely and decisively does geography bear upon the question of the employment of air power in modern war that it merits a chapter to itself . 4 : THE GEOGRAPHICAL FACTOR AND CONTINUITY OF EFFORT AIR power possesses in itself a very high power of concentration against any objective within its reach , and concurrently the ability ( due to its range , speed , and evasive qualities ) of effecting surprise . It is therefore a weapon peculiarly suited to offensive action , and imposes upon those who must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , a very considerable departure from the principle of economy of force , if security is to be achieved to any degree . Thus , the presence on the island of Majorca of a Nationalist air force rarely exceeding eight squadrons , able to strike at any point of the eastern coast line of Spain , required the Loyalists to maintain at every important military objective-point on that coast a considerable establishment of anti-aircraft artillery and pursuit aviation , and to divert to the s. // service of Air Raid Precautions great quantities of men , money and supplies . From this example , it will be clear how very largely the effective employment of air power is conditioned by geography . It is not , as yet , an effective weapon at very great ranges . The radius of action of average European bombing formations is approximately 500 ? 750 miles in war , with reasonably effective bomb loads . Increased range in general means increased size , cost , and maintenance charges , and as to individual planes increased vulnerability ? or to put it in another way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bombing force by a single anti-aircraft shell or a single well-handled pursuit plane . In a struggle between western European powers , the present ranges are adequate for all reasonable purposes ; but there are indications that increased range and speed are constantly being sought after . As has already been stated , defense against the air weapon , like all defense , requires depth . A seacoast position within reach of hostile aviation is seriously handicapped , for the // attack may come upon it without the least warning , as in the case of Barcelona and Valencia ; the nearer to the coast , the less the warning , the greater the exposure . London , for example , now can expect little more than ten minutes ' warning of German planes coming in from seaward over the East Anglian coast . Anti-aircraft defense is entirely based on the period of warning available , and the first element in a system of anti-aircraft defense is a net of reporting stations linked to a central control office by wire or radio . The very great advantage which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their seacoasts and their land frontiers is therefore quite clear ; for it will be a very different thing , for example , a very different quality of risk to be run , for German bombers to attack London , with but a ten minutes ' warning period , and for British bombers to attack Berlin ? for which purpose they must fly for an hour , more or less , over German soil , with anti-aircraft batteries banging away at them and pursuit squadrons hopping off from every ' drome , both to intercept them // before they reach their target and to cut off their retreat . Moreover , another very great advantage is possessed by a nation whose internal arrangements present a great dispersion of vital industries , of important commercial and shipping centers , and of population ; for dispersion is one of the best protections against air attack , offering as it does targets of smaller average intrinsic value to any given operation . This advantage also is possessed by Germany as against Great Britain , for there is no center in Germany anywhere nearly comparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Were Berlin erased completely from the map , Germany could carry on ; were London erased completely , the heart of the British Empire would have ceased to beat . Moreover there has been of late a tendency for British industry to gather round London , seeking the commercial advantages of nearness to the great Imperial center of all things ; this has been accentuated by the availability of electric power under the " grid " system of power distribution , which no longer makes it necessary I // for industry to remain near the iron and coal sources of the Midlands . Yet the Midlands themselves still include the vast preponderance of British heavy industry , to a proportionate extent unmatched by any comparable area in Germany , even the Rhineland . It may be said that such a thing as the complete destruction of London or any other great city by air power is an impossibility , as a practical thing . And quite truly , by reason of air power 's greatest limitation , that of time of flight . Major General Fuller has remarked that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liege to Paris in eight hours , given wholly favorable circumstances . Of course , he adds , an airplane could fly there in one hour , and do considerable damage on its arrival ; the difference being that it could not stay there and continue doing damage , while the armored force could . This is perhaps the most important limitation of air power to be remembered in considering the effect of bombing attacks ? that the bomber , having let go its deadly cargo , can do no more harm until it has got safely home // again and taken on another bomb-load . Thus , to obtain any measure of continuity of action , anything resembling a steady application of force similar to that which may , for example , be obtained from an artillery bombardment , the number of airplanes employed must be very large , and will increase in direct propor tion to the distance to be flown from base to target . But for decisive results , this continuity of effort must be obtained . Sporadic attacks , falling at different points upon so large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they can not hope to effect anything like complete destruction , even of a hart of the city . But what of the toll in lives ? What of the effects on civilian morale ? What , indeed , of the whole theory of " breaking the civil will. , " which has grown out of the persuasive writ ings of the late Italian General Douhet ? There is some evidence as to what can be done along that line , from the record of the air attacks on Barcelona , March 16-17-18 , 1938.1 // In a total period of V hours and II minutes , 13 raids were made on Barcelona , at intervals varying from i hour 2.9 minutes to 8 hours 18 minutes . The material damage was consider-able , but scattered . The effect on the civil morale was tremendous . Mr. John Langdon-Davies states that these thirteen raids , de-livered by half a dozen planes at a time , " de stroyed the whole mental life of a million and a half people for forty hours . " Other accounts tend to support this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raids were no new thing to Barcelona ; the city had been raided before , and often . It was the keeping it up , the con tinuity , which produced the results men tioned.2 Continuity of effort , then , is the deciding factor in effectiveness for bombing attacks on cities , whether the object be material or moral effect , whether the actual target be the city itself or the morale of its populace . THE GREAT GAMBLE ? GERMANY VS . BRITAIN CAN continuity of effort be obtained in air attacks upon European capitals or other great cities in case of a " full-dress " war ? As to Paris or Berlin , with their inland locations and their wide-flung defenses and reporting nets , one may regard the possibility as doubtful . The defense may not prevent the first raid or two from getting home , but anything like a continuous series of attacks would probably be broken up and eventually attended with ruinous losses . Half a dozen planes at a time would not suffice for such large targets , even if they could reach them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance of being completely wiped out by prowling pursuit squadrons . Larger numbers would have to be used , to ensure that some would get through ; and the toll of losses would mount very rapidly . 59 6o BOMBS BURSTING IN AIR As to London , however , the situation is rather different . Here the warning period will be short ; not so short as at Barcelona , which is directly on the coast , but short enough in all conscience ? though on the evidence of Major General Rowan-Robinson , the British have devised a means for dealing with " the Technique of Silent Approach . " The distance to be flown from the German North Sea airports to London is 330 miles ; from Majorca to Barcelona is but 115 . Assuming the time of flight from the German air bases to London to be I2 hours , allowing also 1 hour for maneuver , location of target , etc. , the total elapsed time from takeoff to return would be 4 hours . On the assumption that no one unit can perform such a mission more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor involved , and because of the necessity of overhaul of material , it is apparent that 6 units can within a given period of 48 hours deliver 11 attacks on London ( this , of course , discounting probable losses ) . In order to deliver attacks every hour , as Hitler is said to have threatened to do , 14 units would be required . THE GREAT GAMBLE 6i To attack so large and well-defended a target as London , it would hardly be worth while to send less than ZS planes in each bombing unit ; 50 would be much better . For the hourly attack , therefore , the required force would be from 600 to I2oo planes . But now the factor of loss must be considered . There are no percentage figures available which will enable us to set forth any precise estimate ; the first attack or two might be made with the full effect of surprise , with little if any loss . Thereafter , however , the toll of losses would mount ; and certainly there would be interceptions of homing bombers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserted that to attack London every hour for 48 hours , with So planes per mission , about z000 bombing planes would have to be assigned to the task , together with a suitable number of pursuit planes to provide some measure of escort , at least for the part of the journey within their range ; 400 pursuit planes might be sufficient for this mission . If the frequency of the attacks be reduced , the number of planes may likewise be cut ; on the other hand , if this is done , the number per // mission ought to be increased to get a greater effect . If the whole period of the bombing effort be prolonged for more than 48 hours continuously , more planes and more crews will be needed ; the toll of losses will mount , and crews can not keep on flying a bombing mission under such trying circumstances every day for a long period of time . All these calculations , which of course can not be exact but may serve as criteria on which to form some idea of the effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even for bombing attacks of decidedly limited nature , a very large force is necessary in order to obtain that continuity of effort which is the sine qua non of success . We must then ask ourselves , what success is hoped for ? From the German point of view , what is this air effort meant to do ? Obviously , it is not meant to destroy physically the entire city of London . It can not hope to do so . Then , it must be meant to attack the morale of the populace , and , by spreading panic and horror throughout the island of Great Britain , obtain victory by attacking // the civil will to fight and compelling it to submit rather than undergo further bombing ; or , in another sense , to paralyze the military effort of Britain , the striking arms of the body politic , by disruption and disorganization of the vital centers of moral strength from which that body gets its life and its spirit . But this is a bid for direct victory . This is a decisive effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be made with partial forces , or indeed with anything less than the whole power of the German air force ? every plane , every pilot , every bomb thrown into one terrific effort to overwhelm the British people at a stroke . Now , pursuing the German angle a little farther , Germany must , at the outset of any war , or in weighing the chances of victory if war should come , consider that at present she is far from supreme in the military sense on land or at sea . Her army , despite very great efforts , can not yet dispose of the trained reserves , the trained corps of officers and noncommissioned officers , and , in some categories , of the material which is at the command of the French army . Her western fortifications are by // no means the all-but-impenetrable barrier offered by the Maginot Line . Her ally , Italy , is uncertain as a military support ? at once the most vulnerable , and the weakest of the great powers , with an army of whose fighting qualities there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with an industrial effort obviously slackening under the strains of the past three years . The German navy , with its submarines and fast capital ships , could certainly offer a considerable menace to the British trade routes ? for a time , and if assured of bases outside the North Sea . But those bases must be in Spain , or in Africa . If in Spain , there is no assurance that they would continue to be available very long , since they would certainly be the object of very heavy attacks which might not only be successful in themselves , but might alter the mind of the Spanish leaders as to the advisability of continuing to support allies whose help could no longer reach them ; if in Africa , they would likewise be attacked , and , their communications being entirely by sea ( since Africa has no resources of its own adequate // for the support of a great naval or air base ) , they would be at the mercy of the tremendously superior British and French sea-power . Germany 's one great present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks the whole of that air force in a mighty attempt to overwhelm Britain by bombing , it will be the greatest gamble ever taken by a major power since Napoleon 's invasion of Russia . If it fails , Germany , or at any rate Nazi Germany , is doomed . And it may fail ? the powers of resistance of the British people can not be summarized and estimated with accuracy , nor can the outcome in the military sense be assured . The Air Defense of Great Britain may prove more formidable in the event than optimistic Germans or pessimistic Britons now suppose . Yet if Germany takes that gamble , she must not deal in half-measures . To make a partial effort , with such a stake as this on the board , would be sheer stupidity , and foredoomed to failure . If air attacks of a limited nature are to be made upon the British Isles , they would far better be directed against precise objectives : the naval dockyards , the // great docks of London ( by which from a quar ter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the switching stations of the great power " grid , " railway centers , munitions and air-craft factories , airdromes , and so on ? and against sea-borne commerce . Such attacks the German air force could carry out without vio lating the principle of strategic concentration , since a squadron one day employed in bombing Woolwich Arsenal might on the next , and from the same base , be directed against an objective in France or Belgium . So far , we have considered the German air effort from the point of view of concentration and offensive action . There is also security to be taken into account . Of what arm of the Anglo-French forces would Germany be most afraid at the beginning of any war in Western Europe ? Not , certainly , of the still inferior air forces of those powers . Not , certainly , of their greatly superior navies , which can threaten her only by blockade ? a long process . She would be most afraid of the magnificent French army , perhaps to be reinforced by British diTHE // visions . How , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force , be employed from the point of view of security ? Obviously , by attacking the mobilization and concentration centers of the French army , by checking the movement of French troops toward the frontier , and by impeding the crossing of the British expeditionary force to the Continent . Bombing attacks on British cities will not serve Germany very well if in the meanwhile French armies have forced the Siegfried Line and are marching into the heart of Germany , overrunning her air bases and aircraft factories . Whether they could do so successfully or not is of course a question which can be answered only in the event ; to prevent them from getting near enough to do so at all is a far better way of protecting Germany than to depend on the ability of the present German army to stop them ? an attempt which would be made under severe handicaps , as above mentioned . Thus it is apparent that ? despite Germany 's very great air superiority , resting not only on a superior strength of first-line planes but above all on greatly superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war in which she might become engaged with Great Britain and France is by no means assured by reason of her superior air strength . Such a war confronts her instantly with the alternative of throwing her whole air force into an attempt to overwhelm Britain , as the citadel of the Allied power ; or of adopting the more cautious tactics which may well lead her into a long war of attrition in which the superior resources and naval power of the Allies may in the end prove decisive . Indeed , most experts are agreed that Germany can not endure the strain of a long war , largely because of her lack of essential raw materials . Yet can she calmly envisage the gamble , either ? For if it fails , she must then prepare for a desperate resistance with the added handicaps of a crippled air force and of infuriated and vengeful enemies . If it fails , can she depend on the fidelity of Italy ? Can she be sure that Poland , Rumania , Yugoslavia , Soviet Russia will not seize upon the golden opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazi regime even be sure that its own people will continue to // support it in defeat as they have in victory ? To be sure , there is an arguable case for anticipating success . As we have shown , the position of London is a most vulnerable one and its defense presents many difficulties ; the Barcelona " experiment " has shown what may be done to civilian morale by continuous bombing attacks ; the Siegfried Line may hold ; the eastern powers may remain quiescent until they see how the cat is going to jump . There is a chance of victory . But ? it is a chance , and not a certainty ; not even a reasonable probability . Can Germany afford such a gamble , in which she throws on the gaming board all that her present rulers have gained , all the fruits of years of effort , in the hope of winning a military victory which even if won , may prove but fleeting and illusory in its benefits ? Not , one would say , unless there is no other way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven to bay , has no option but to fight or to surrender . The masters of modern Germany are not fools . Why should they take the risks of war , and // undergo the strains which it will impose upon their none-too-assured economic and social structure , while they have a better and safer method of achieving their objectives ? That better and safer method they have discovered , and are at this moment using with great success . And of that method , their air power is the foundation and the source of strength . The method may be very briefly described by a short and unpleasant word ? Blackmail . 6 : INTERNATIONAL BLACKMAIL THE conditions under which a war in Western Europe would have to be fought , as set forth in the preceding chapter , are quite as well understood in British and French military circles as in German . When , at the height of the Munich crisis , General Gamelin , chief of staff of the French Army , admitted French inferiority in the air but asserted that he would take his army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at present ) in four days , " like marmalade , " he was stating nothing less than the truth . Of course , he was reasoning that the bulk of the German army would be engaged with the thirty-four excellent Czechoslovak divisions ; today those divisions no longer exist , their equipment is in German hands . But when Germany took the apparent chance of confronting such a situation , she did not do so , on evidence now quite apparent , without a firm conviction in the 7L // mind of Hitler that there would be no war . Upon what did that conviction rest ? On knowledge of the characters of the British and French statesmen involved , or their previous commitment to a do-nothing policy ? In part , perhaps . But Britain and France are democracies , with parliamentary forms of government which permit very rapid popular dealing with cabinets which thwart the popular will . Whatever Hitler 's certainty as to how Messrs . Chamberlain and Bonnet , for example , might react to the situation with which he proposed to confront them , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and French peoples ? How could he be certain that a wave of popular indignation ( such as that which followed the exposure of the Hoare-Laval agreement ) would not sweep over Britain and France , driving Chamberlain and Bonnet from office , replacing them with men who would bluntly confront Hitler with the disastrous dilemma of instant retreat or instant war ? There is some evidence that the period of strain which preceded the " armistice of Munich " was deliberately , indeed artificially proINTERNATIONAL // longed while this question was receiving the careful consideration of the German authorities . The answer which they found may be read in any news correspondence from London and Paris during this period . Every reliable report from those capitals tells of the mounting fear that seized upon the population ; the fear of being bombed from the air . The measures of Air Raid Precautions undertaken by the French and particularly by the British authorities did little to assuage these fears . The sight of trenches being dug in the public parks , of anti-aircraft guns being mounted , the provision of sand-bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas masks , added to arrangements being made for the evacuation of the city populations , were hardly calculated to reduce the public tremors . Indeed , it is hard to escape the suspicion that certain of these measures , carried out as they were with what can only be described as an air of ghoulish ostentation , may have been intended as backfires against any possible flaring of public resistance to the policy upon // which the governments had determined . However necessary some of the precautions adopted may have been , and undoubtedly were , it hardly can have been essential to rouse people at three o'clock in the morning to receive their distribution of gas masks ( including one for the baby ) , nor can the mounting of an antiaircraft gun on Westminster Bridge be regarded as a valuable contribution to the defense of London , though the location is one ensuring the maximum of public notice . So far as the British people are concerned , moreover , they had been well " conditioned " for the situation which appeared to confront them . For years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pamphlets , magazine and newspaper articles describing with a full measure of the most revolting detail just what would happen to London in the event of an air attack . These descriptions , indeed , went far beyond the bounds even of the sufficiently disquieting facts of the case , describing London as utterly helpless , the bomber as " invincible , " and all measures of defense as worse than useless . // It is not therefore to be wondered at that there was fear in London during the suspense period of the Munich crisis . It is still less to be wondered at if there shall be fear in London again should another crisis occur ; for afterward it was shown that the Air Defense of Great Britain was very far from ready to do its job . Fighter aircraft were wanting , anti-aircraft guns too few in number and supplied with the wrong calibers of ammunition , Air Raid Precautions badly organized and inefficient . And Cassandra voices were heard prophesying : " No matter what you do , the bomber will always get through . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved since Munich , will be still more considerably improved in time to come ; but the public will remember what it was , and has little opportunity of knowing , and little ability to judge , how far it has been renovated . This is not to say , by any means , that the British people would not have supported their government had resistance to German demands been decided on last autumn , or will not if in some future crisis a like determination shall // be taken . What is contended is simply that they did not force the government to take a firmer stand , that Hitler could in fact pretty well count on there being no immediate public reaction against the government 's surrender : and that the fear of being bombed had a great deal to do with this quiescence . The British are not a nation of cowards ; neither are the French . But any old soldier will tell you that when he was under fire for the first time he had the impression that the enemy were shooting directly at him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual life ; each householder in a city which may be subjected at any moment to aerial bombardment can hardly escape the thought that it is his home , his family , which is destined for summary destruction . Tables of percentages and the law of probabilities are likely to leave people in such circumstances quite cold . Moreover , governments themselves , not only members of cabinets , but those lesser advisers and assistants whose influence goes so far in many cases , are but human beings when all is said and done . They , like the humINTERNATIONAL // bier citizens , hesitate long before setting their own lives and the lives of their dear ones upon the cast of the dice . A man does not acquire sublime courage and selfless hardihood by the simple process of being elected or appointed to public office . When the grave decisions of peace or war confronted a European cabinet of the last century , there was at least the knowledge in the heart of everyone who had to take part in making the decision , that he personally , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if fighting there had to be , would be done by soldiers and sailors on the frontier or the high seas . Or , to take a larger and more charitable view of the situation , those in a position of responsibility did not have to envisage the immediate ruin of their cities , the immediate slaughter of large numbers of their women and children , but only of fighting men whose duty it was to defend the state . Today all that has changed . In dealing with such people as now control the German government , the statesmen of other countries have to reckon not only upon such devastation 1 // and butchery , if they decide to fight , but even on the possibility of such an attack being suddenly launched upon them without an instant 's warning if they show too great a spirit of resistance , if they are not quick enough to do the bidding of the dictators , if they seem to be concerting measures which might afford the dictators cause for worry . And if it becomes plainly a question of fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chances of ultimate victory if they decide on fighting , but also the certainty of a horrible slaughter of the innocent whether or not the ultimate victory is gained . Moreover , their freedom of decision is seriously , and as to any given case perhaps fatally , impaired by the public fears above referred to . When all is said and done , it is not possible for any British or French cabinet to determine upon war unless it can count on popular support . That support , even though a decision to fight may be the one hope of salvation , may be increasingly difficult to obtain now that it means , or may mean , the bombing of the cities . // It may be contended that this situation is really a force for peace ; that in the end it will result in the realization of the pet dream of the pacifist ? war becoming too terrible for rational human beings any longer to endure the thought of it . But this is a shortsighted and tragically onesided view of the matter . Carried to its logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may enjoy peace only at the price Czechoslovakia has paid for it ? such peace as the dictators are willing to allow their serfs as the price of abject submission , such peace as was offered only yesterday to Rumania : abandon your industry , labor in field and mine for our advantage , and we will graciously permit you to keep a pretense of being an independent nation . Yet there is another side to the matter , and that lies in the fact that the strain may be too long continued . Human beings find it difficult to endure strains of this nature if over long , or too frequently recurrent . They arrive at last at a fatalistic belief that anything will be better than longer endurance of terror , and then they 8o BOMBS BURSTING IN AIR are likely to turn upon their tormentors and destroy them or perish in the attempt . An Englishman arrived at this point would put it that he was " fed up with those blighters . " The result may very well be a sudden stiffening of public opinion , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drastic action at an unfavorable moment . People under strains of the sort described do not stop to weigh chances or to select a suitable time for their reactions . They react like a suddenly loosened spring . There is at least some reason to believe that it is such a stiffening of public opinion in Great Britain which has brought about the present attitude of the British Government ; the ultimate results , at the present writing , are yet to be known . Meanwhile , to those who may say that air power and the threat of air power is a twoedged sword which cuts both ways , the reply is also plain : not while present conditions obtain in Europe . Not while Germany possesses her present very great advantage in air strength , and especially in the ability to replace . Not // while Britain , which must be the heart and soul of any alliance against her , is so terribly vulnerable . Not , above all , while Europe is divided ideologically between dictators and democracies , for dictators may threaten , dictators may blackmail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weapon in the international struggle , is one which may be wielded effectively only by a dictator whose purposes are obscure , whose intentions are shrouded in mystery , whose name is synonymous with ruthlessness and terrorism . What such a man may do , no one knows . And the fear of the unknown is ever more potent than the fear of a known thing which may be weighed and measured and resolutely faced . It is blackmail which rules Europe today , and nothing else : blackmail made possible only by the existence of air power . EUROPE ? UNDER THE SHADOW OF WINGS THAT the ability of air power to exercise so profound an influence on international relations is being deliberately exploited by the expansionist states of Europe , goes of course without saying . Spokesmen for these countries have not been backward in putting the matter in plain words , as recent utterances by such highly placed persons as Signor Mussolini and Field Marshal Goering bear witness . In applying the doctrine to great powers , there is of course a certain vagueness adopted in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would hardly be accomplished by such outright threats as might drive an enraged opponent into war . The threat is there , in the background ; Barcelona is there as the horrible example ; there is no need to say specifically : " Sign on the dotted line , or we bomb London . " 83 // In dealing with smaller powers , more direct methods can be employed . Agreement to the extension of the German " protectorate " over Bohemia and Moravia is said to have been wrung from the Czechs under threat of bombing Prague . The German occupation of Memel was accomplished without resistance by means of a threat to bomb Kaunas . It is however notable that such countries as Ethiopia , China and Albania , which do not present favorable or vulnerable targets for bombardment aviation , have had to be conquered " the hard way " : by the actual use of troops . Blackmail is effective only when this method does not have to be employed ; it is effective only against a people which must face tremendous losses if attacked from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important factor . Air power is the weapon of blackmail ; land power and sea power can not be , because their incidence upon the individual is remote in point of time and direct effect . Furthermore , as between combatants of anything like equal strength , or even as between a great power and a small one which may expect powerful support if it is attacked , threats // of invasion or blockade can not be effective because of the uncertainty of the outcome . Victory may incline either way , and both sides know it . War under these circumstances holds risks for both combatants . The threat of air power is of a different nature , and has little to do with expectations of ultimate victory . Whatever the outcome , the threatened power must face the immediate and certain destruction of thousands of innocent lives ; the smaller the threatened power , the greater proportionately will appear the impending disaster . Under such circumstances , those who are profiting by them will have little enough desire to put their " sharp sword " to the trial of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result . Indeed , weighing as carefully as possible every factor involved , the balance of probability inclines against the chance of victory by such methods . Since this is quite as well appreciated in Germany as elsewhere , the balance of probability also inclines against these methods ever being actually put into practice . If war broke out in Europe , Germany might // throw her whole air force into a desperate attempt to bomb the British into submission ; but the chances are that she would not . The chances are that such bombs as fell on British soil would be directed at particular military objectives , of sufficient size to insure a reasonable percentage of effective hits . Germany might , of course ? very likely would ? begin by exploiting her air superiority by a vigorous and well-directed attack against the British air force ; that is , by bombing airdromes , aircraft parks , aircraft and aero-engine factories , and the great docks by which air reinforcements might come from abroad . But very soon the attention of a great part of her air force would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French army . These considerations do not , however , enter into the calculations of the average British citizen , as previously emphasized . What is important to understand here is , that military probabilities do not in such cases matter very much as long as war does not actually arrive . As long as the expansionist powers are accomplishing their objectives by blackmail , the // thing that matters is the effectiveness of air power as a threat , and not what it might actually do if put to the test . In the physical field , it remains a weapon of uncertain value and untried possibilities . In the psychological field , it is dominant and all-important . Very likely , lacking the air weapon , there would have been either war or a German retreat at Munich ; but then , lacking the air weapon , Herr Hitler would never have allowed himself to get into such a position . The existence of the air weapon may be delaying war , and this has been hailed as an advantage for the western powers ; but this idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so widely held and asserted , can only be described as the great illusion of the moment . Consider the European military situation reduced to its elementals : ( I ) Armies . The French army is still the best and most formidable in Europe . It will become no stronger , nor much more efficient . It can not . The German army , on the contrary , now that it has the Czech equipment for its reserve divisions , has as its principal defect a // shortage of officers and trained reserves due to the abandonment of universal military training for the period 1919-1934 , under the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles . Obviously this is a defect which time will cure , and the most frantic efforts are now in progress in Germany to catch up . The British have rather halfheartedly introduced conscription , and they propose to increase their Territorial Army to the point where they can put 19 regular and Territorial divisions on the Continent . But do these make up for the 34 magnificent Czechoslovak divisions which were lost at Munich ? to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austria was absorbed ? Will even the adoption of conscription by Britain make up for the further loss , to be anticipated if Germany 's onward march continues under the protection of her air threat , of 30 to 6o Polish divisions , of 16 Yugoslav divisions , of Zz Rumanian divisions ? Will it make up for the changed status of Spain , by which German and Italian submarines and aircraft menace vital communications , and a warhardened army of half a million men threatens // France on a new front ? Or for the changed status of Ethiopia , by which Egypt and the Sudan are menaced by 6o,000 Italian troops ? ( i ) Navies . Germany is not building a navy to attempt to fight the British in line-of-battle . She learned the folly of attempting that in the last war , short of the impossible task of achieving actual superiority . Her navy is a commercedestroying navy , and with every passing month it is growing . Every unit which she adds , whether in submarines for attacking merchant vessels or in fast armored ships or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much added threat to Britain 's all-important maritime life-lines . The fact that the British fleet is also increasing is important , but the comparison to be made is not proportionate , rather it is one between present conditions and what they may be when Germany has ' co oceangoing submarines , 9 fast capital ships , 15 cruisers , and a firm grip on the Spanish and African bases from which these ships can menace British sea-communications . No proportionately larger increase in the British fleet will wholly offset this German advantage , for // even with great superiority of numbers it takes time to scour the seas clear of raiders ? and it does not take any great length of time for human beings to starve . As between France and Italy , the situation is different . Today the French are heavily superior to the Italians in battle-line strength ; in two years ' time they will be little better than equal . ( 3 ) Air Forces . In the matter of numbers and of productive capacity , the one proportionate improvement of the present situation possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no advance in these respects will do anything to alter the geographic disadvantages under which Britain , especially , labors in the matter of air strategy ; while the one factor now unfavorable to Germany , that of access to raw materials and fuel , will alter in favor of Germany the farther the " Drang nach Osten " proceeds . ( q . ) Economic and Strategical Factors . Indeed , it is in this matter of raw materials that the greatest German gains are to be anticipated . Once let the German grip close on the oil , timber and foodstuffs of Rumania and // Hungary ; once let the Germans stand on the shores of the Black Sea , with direct access to the Caucasus and to the Dardanelles ( perhaps assisted by an Italian move farther south ) and Germany becomes blockade-proof , invincible to the pressure of British sea-power , capable of indefinite resistance against any conceivable military attack . It is to the political disintegration and subsequent conquest of eastern and southeastern Europe that the Rome-Berlin Axis looks forward with hope and confidence . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire and the French Empire will be definitely declining toward the horizon . ( 5 ) Moral Factors . Here we are dealing with forces and elements less easily measured . Continued German and Italian advance without resistance by the western powers will very likely tend to cause the lesser nations to bow their heads before the approaching storm . Similarly it may tend toward the moral disintegration of the forces of resistance in larger nations . On the other hand is to be considered the possibility , before mentioned , that the long-continued strain may produce a violent 92 . BOMBS BURSTING IN AIR reaction in Britain and France , and perhaps elsewhere . Weighing all the foregoing facts , it is perfectly obvious that time does not march under the banner of democracy . Time is on the side of the expansionist states . And time is being gained by the threat of air bombardment which they hold over those who might otherwise oppose them . Such is the military situation of Europe . As I write these words , a new and seemingly thoroughly sincere effort is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together a new coalition to resist the further expansion of the Axis states . Poland , Rumania , Greece and Turkey have been included , though the attitude of Russia remains uncertain . Guarantees , implicit or otherwise , have been extended to Belgium , Switzerland and the Netherlands . Whether this effort will or will not be successful , remains to be seen . Whether it will or will not lead to immediate war , no man can foretell . The answers to these questions may or may not be known to every reader of these lines by the time they are in print . // But the circumstances which brought about this desperate , almost last-minute stand , which compelled it to be made under far less favorable conditions than those of 1933 , 1935 or 1936 , are ? so far as military factors are concerned ? bound up with the development of air power not as a weapon of war , but as an instrument of international blackmail . Whatever the immediate outcome of the European situation , one thing seems certain ? that Europe must continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but seemingly distant day when a formula for permanent peace amongst her clashing peoples can be discovered and applied . For the peoples of Europe , meanwhile , there is no escape from the threat of flying death . The changes in the military situation of the world brought about by this condition of affairs are of far-reaching consequence to the people of the United States ; for we are witnessing the beginning of the decline of British sea-power , as the energies and resources of Britain are compelled to turn to the urgent necessities of the defense of the British Isles // against a form of attack from which their navy can not protect them . British sea-power and British diplomacy find their freedom of action seriously compromised ; and the inheritor of the trident , the one great nation which still is free from air threat , which still retains that freedom of action which is indispensable for the effective employment of seapower , is the United States . What does this mean for the future of America ? How may air power affect us , not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What lessons must we draw , for our own military policies , from the unhappy history of the past three years of European turmoil ? Let us see . PART Two AMERICA 'S INTEREST IN AIR POWER 8 : AMERICA AND THE AIR WEAPON IN considering the effect of the development of air power on American strategy and national policy , we have two principal dangers to guard against : First , being attacked from the air . Second , being afraid of being attacked from the air . We must make ourselves safe from actual attack , and we must likewise make ourselves safe from being blackmailed . The primary necessity is for clear and careful thinking on the subject . We must neither be overconfident because of our ocean barriers , nor overtimid because of lurid scareheads and half-baked prophecies . The moment we compare the position of the United States with that of the other great powers , we come upon the factor of distance . If geography has a profound effect upon the use of air power in the Old World , favoring Ger-97 // many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan , how much more lavishly has geography favored our own country ! There is no great air power in the Western Hemisphere except the United States , nor does any other great power possess an air base in this part of the world . We are divided by two great oceans from the continents where such bases exist . These oceans are both too wide to be spanned by bomb-carrying airplanes . Therefore , to make an air attack of any consequence upon this country , or upon any country of the Americas , it is necessary for the attacker to begin by sending men and ships across the ocean to seize and fortify and equip a base for his air operations . Our security therefore begins with the control of sea-communications , and is primarily the responsibility of our navy . No other great power is so fortunately located , not even Japan . These are the underlying truths upon which our national strategy is based . These are the reasons , rooted in hard geographic facts , which will make our country the great seaAMERICA // power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The forces which have been working to that end have been in operation since the beginning of our history ; unrecog nized , perhaps , as what they were , or seen as in a glass , darkly , resented and resisted by some , acknowledged and welcomed by others .

Placed between two great oceans , command ing thc only short line of communications be tween them , freed of the menace of powerful neighbors , possessed of natural resources in such abundance and variety as to be unrivaled in economic self-sufficiency , possessed also of a vast industrial system and of standards of living and education higher than those of any other great nation , we have also the priceless boon of being immune from direct attack by I00 BOMBS BURSTING IN AIR the new weapons of the air under the shadow of whose wings so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and portents of the times indicated the rising star of a great people , it is today ? and the star is ours . It is a star of the sea ; for all our foreign contacts are by or over the sea . By the sea must danger come to us , if at all , and on the sea must it be met and destroyed before it reaches our shores . The control of sea-communications is the key to our national security ; while we hold that key , we are safe . No other great nation can say as much . But the control of sea-communications , while primarily a matter of fleets and naval bases , is no longer wholly so .. Air power , reaching out over the water , has its word to say here as well as over the land . Accepting , as we must , as the basis of our military policy , the maintenance of a fleet superior to that of any enemy or combination of enemies which we may have to face in either of our oceans , we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two oceans . It must be kept concentrated , or it may be defeated in AMERICA AND THE AIR WEAPON IOI detail . Hence we must always be prepared to offer a stout defense on that maritime frontier which is not at any given moment covered by the presence of the fleet . To such a defense , air power may make important contributions ; just as it may also be a powerful arm of the fleet itself . We must further realize that just as the fleet 's bases and the great by-pass of Panama must be protected by troops from direct attack , so also they must be protected by air forces . Neither fleet nor air force can long exist without the support of the land ; offensive action , in which role both find their greatest usefulness in war , must ever spring from a strong defensive base . Thus our strategy , advantaged as it is by a matchless position , must take account of the necessities imposed upon it by the nature of possible hostile weapons , by the contributions of science to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every form of attack which may come against us , ready also to deal out any form of attack against a foe which may challenge us in arms . Here again must be reiterated that the rise IO2 . BOMBS BURSTING IN AIR of the air weapon is not the least of those forces , before referred to , which mark out our destiny as a great sea-power . For our defense against air attack is obviously to keep hostile air bases out of this hemisphere , a matter of sea-command supported by a system of forward bases for our own fleet and air force , the com-munications of which bases must be largely by sea . Indeed , as the radius of action of air-planes increases , so must widen the scope of our military interest . It has ever been the policy of the predomi-nant sea-power to prevent the establishment of a possible enemy in a strategic location threatening to the sea-power 's interests . Air power emphasizes the necessity of this policy . A few years ago , we scarcely looked beyond the Caribbean and Hawaii . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the West African coast , and many if not most of the islands of the Pacific . This does not mean that we must acquire all these places ; it means that any change in tenure or military establishment there is a matter of con-cern to us , and may be a matter of forcible // action if diplomacy will not serve us to prevent unfavorable conditions from arising . It is well to point out that being islands , or isolated coastal footholds , all these positions are accessible only by or over the sea . Their possession is therefore retained at the price of remaining the friend of the predominant sea-power , which can there tolerate no enemy . As affecting such positions , this is a principle of practical international politics which has been pretty well recognized by all concerned during the past two hundred years ; the coming of air power has , it is true , shifted the ownership of the trident and given certain places a military importance which they did not heretofore possess , but has not altered the basic principle upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More than a hundred years ago , Nelson epitomized the underlying theory of sea-power in his remark : " The sea-frontiers of Britain are the coast lines of her enemies . " Today America , looking outward , may well consider that her sea-frontiers are the limits of operation of land-based aircraft from the Atlantic shores I04 BOMBS BURSTING IN AIR of Europe and the Pacific shores of Asia . With this statement of fundamentals , we may pass on to the consideration of details . The incidence of air power upon American strategy and military policy must be examined from several angles : ( I ) Defense against all possible forms of hostile air attack , by whatever means are available for such defense . ( z ) The part which our air power may play in defense against other forms of attack . ( 3 ) The part which our air power may play in conducting offensive operations against any conceivable enemy , when and if such operations become necessary . ( 4 ) The proportions of the air power which the preceding considerations indicate as necessary for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future developments so far as these may be foreseen . 9 . CAN AMERICA BE ATTACKED FROM THE AIR ? AIR attack upon the United States , upon the Panama Canal , or indeed upon any American nation or position , can theoretically be made in one of four ways : ( I ) By an American nation , either acting alone or in alliance with other nations . ( z ) By a non-American nation possessing a base in this hemisphere . ( 3 ) By a non-American nation flying airplanes directly across the ocean from its own bases . ( 4 ) By planes flown from floating bases aircraft carriers or catapult ships . Let us examine these various possibilities in turn . In all the Western Hemisphere , save for our own , the only military air force of any consequence is that of Canada , which has some 300 planes of all types , and a considerable and // increasing production . Argentina ( with some 15o planes ) has the largest South American air force ; but it has little production to back it up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which so far has produced only training planes . The same is to be said of Brazil 's single plant . In Peru there is a plant which , under contract with the Italian Caproni firm , is said to have a capacity of 50 aircraft per year . Mexico has one small plant , and is going to have another by arrangement with the Canadian Car and Foundry Company . No other American nation manufactures aircraft . No American nation , except ourselves , possesses a naval aircraft carrier . It may therefore be postulated that there does not now exist in the Western Hemisphere any serious air threat to this country , nor the means for the fabrication of such a threat , even assuming that any of these nations could become our enemy . Only Canada can produce aircraft in any quantity , and we need hardly consider the possibility of a hostile Canada . Therefore , any air attack on any point either in the United States or in the whole of the WestAMERICA // ern Hemisphere must come from across one or the other of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bases of all those powers which possess sufficient air strength to make them formidable . Certain European powers have possessions in this hemisphere . Fortunately , these are nations with which we are unlikely to be involved in conflict : Great Britain , France and the Netherlands . None of them maintains in their American possessions any sort of military air establishment , save insofar as Canada 's installations may be taken into account as British . Were any of them to become our enemy , or were any of them , as the result of defeat in war , to be compelled to transfer to a hostile power any of their American possessions , we would still ? while we possessed a superior navy ? be in a position to prevent the setting-up of any air base in these possessions , because the planes and material would have first to be brought there from across the sea . This same consideration , of course , applies to any attempt by a non-American power to seize an air base in the Western Hemisphere Io8 BOMBS BURSTING IN AIR by force ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to considering such an expedition is command of the intervening sea . Unless this can be had , there is little hope of success , and that factor is controlled by the power best armed and best placed to act in the sea areas across which the attacking force must move . Direct attack upon us by ocean-flying planes is not possible today . We are told that it may be so in the very near future ; but one may doubt it . The distance to be flown from European bases to the shores of the United States is in the vicinity of 3000 ? 35001 miles , more or less according to points of departure and landfall . The radius of action of European bombing planes being at present not more than 750 miles , which is amply sufficient for present European conditions , we have therefore to envisage the creation of an entirely new bomb ing force for this specific purpose , of sufficient range and in sufficient numbers to make such an attempt worth while . // The maximum range of any known bomber is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This range can be increased if the bomb-loads are decreased ? but to do that means that the results of the attack will hardly be worth the enormous effort and risk involved . A range of 3000 miles would seem to indicate a radius of action of 15oo , flying from base to target and return . In war , however , this must be again halved , because of the innumerable and unforeseeable exigencies of combat , weather , search and maneuvering . Perhaps in flying direct to a known and easily located target , given good fortune , the very largest types of American bombers might achieve a radius of action of I000 ? IZoo miles , though few commanders would care to count with certainty upon such a performance for the average mission . The larger the bomb-load ? i.e. , the greater the damage the planes can do on reaching their target ? the less the radius of action . Assuming I000 miles as a generous maximum for effective operations , we see that until aeronautical engineering has produced bombers capable IIO BOMBS BURSTING IN AIR of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be subject to direct bombing attacks . This puts the matter well into the future . But this is not all . As just remarked , such ranges are not necessary , indeed are pure waste from the point of view of European opera-tions . If a European power contemplates a direct attack upon this country , it will have to create a bombing force for that particular purpose . It will have to build very large and very expensive planes ? much larger and more expensive than would be needed for its ordi-nary use ? and it will have to build them in very great numbers . In a previous chapter we examined the num-ber of planes required by Germany for main-taining continuous attacks on London over a 33o-mile course . Continuity of effort being the sine qua non for success in bombing attacks on the vital centers of a great power ? either for demolition effect or for attack on the civil morale ? we must assume that no nation will waste its time , money and men in such an attempt unless it plans to obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since the distance to be flown is perhaps ten times that in the case of London , the force required for the same volume of fire-effect will be at least ten times as great for an attack on New York . The number of planes required for continuity of effort rises to astronomical figures when calculated on this basis . It can not too often be emphasized that all war , all contemplation of war is based on the weighing of risk , or cost , against advantage . The uncertainty of weather conditions , of the character of the resistance to be encountered , of the location of the chosen target , of the results of the bombing , of the percentage of loss both coming and going , would in sum total be amply sufficient to deter any sensible European air staff from trying such a thing , or even creating the air force necessary to carry it into execution . Bombing attacks against targets 3000 miles away are not operations upon which any dependence can be placed as to results . Direct attack of this sort can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planes capable of executing it do not exist , II2 BOMBS BURSTING IN AIR and are not likely to exist . It can be ruled out of future calculations , at least over the period for which we can now make plans , both because of this fact and because it does not seem likely to be worth while for any potential enemy to consider such a project . Another form of direct action might , however , be taken into account , and that is direct air support to a Latin American revolutionary party , or to a government of Latin America which has been brought into alliance with a non-American power . This would be more feasible from the technical viewpoint , because the planes flown to such a country would not have to return . It would require the preparation , in advance , of the necessary bases , the previous importation of bombs , fuel , stores , etc. , the setting up of the defenses for the bases , all of which could hardly be done unknown to us . It would further require the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies and reinforcements despatched to the base country in ships , since air transport could not serve such a purpose . We return , therefore , in such a calculation , to the matter // of sea-communications ; for unless these could be kept open , the operations of the expeditionary air force could not be long sustained . The greatest danger would be that the country in question might be one within striking distance of the Panama Canal ; but since all the Atlantic countries which can be so described lie within the Caribbean Sea and are much closer to our air bases than to any European or African base , we ought to be able to deal with such an attempt in its initial stages , before any serious attack on the Canal could be launched . The closest approach of the American continents to the Old World is in the South Atlantic , where the northeastern shoulder of Brazil juts out to within 1700 miles of Africa . Assuming that some expansionist power ? let us say , Germany ? were able to establish herself somewhere on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial airliners have been making regular flights to Brazil for some years , an attempt at a sudden flight by German bombing forces to Brazil might be feasible , again assuming arrangements with some revolutionary movement II4 BOMBS BURSTING IN AIR for their reception . This would not put the bombers within anything like striking distance of the Panama Canal ; the principal object of such a move must be to shut us out of the South Atlantic by the operations of twin bombing forces based respectively in Africa and Brazil , and thereafter gradually to extend German dominance in South America . But since the African as well as the Brazilian base must be dependent on sea-borne supplies ( Africa not being an industrial region , and there being no through railway connections to the part of the African coast in question ) it is difficult indeed to see how such a force could be supported while we maintain a superior navy in the Atlantic . Just as the coast of Africa and its adjacent islands form what may be called " steppingstone " approaches to South America , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greenland and Labrador or Newfoundland form such approaches to the northeastern part of the United States . The first three are possessions or , in a sense , dependencies of Denmark , which is one of the European states // most exposed to German domination . We have recently heard of German attempts to establish some sort of " commercial " air base in Iceland . This is a situation which will bear watching ; for the western end of this chain ? Newfoundland and Labrador ? is a defenseless and remote region . The Azores Islands do not afford satisfactory land air-dromes , but can be used by seaplanes . They lie about 2,400 miles from New York , and Z , 000 miles from Bermuda , which in turn is 770 miles from New York . What is here to be emphasized is our very great interest in any change in the political or military status of : ( I ) West Africa , especially that part nearest Brazil , and including the Canary and Cape Verde Islands . ( 2 . ) Iceland and Greenland . ( 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned , it is not too much to say that we should promptly employ our superior naval strength to prevent by force , if need be , any occupation of these islands by any expansionist power , or the es116 BOMBS BURSTING IN AIR tablishment there of the forces of such a power under any pretext . There is also affirmed the very great value to us of Newfoundland and Bermuda as advanced bases for the use of our own forces , both sea and air ; and of a base which would enable us to approach closer to the northeast corner of Brazil than we can at present from our West Indian bases . So far we have been considering only the Atlantic Ocean , because in the Pacific the distances are so great and our outlying positions so much better placed that we need not fear any of the forms of air attack that have heretofore been considered . In the Pacific as in the Atlantic , however , it will be possible for " tip-and-run " raids to be launched against our coastal cities from aircraft carriers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship , and is hardly likely to be risked for such a purpose , since the results to be expected can not be in any sense worth the loss of a unit so valuable in fleet operations . It is , however , easy enough to convert a merchant vessel into a makeshift // carrier capable of handling a few planes , and such ships might be used with the hope of producing so great a panic amongst our population as to upset , by political pressure , our military plans in other theaters . Against raids of this sort , the only defense is anti-aircraft artillery , pursuit aviation and , in the last analysis , the destruction of the ships launching the attack . Such raids can not be wholly prevented ; but their effect can be minimized by a well-conceived defense . Carrier attacks might be launched against the Panama Canal , which would in certain circumstances be a target whose destruction would be worth the loss of a couple of carriers with all their planes and complements . From the eastward , however , this would require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with considerable difficulty and risk ; from the westward , the distances are again very great , and the chances of unperceived approach are not high . When all is said and done , however , such attacks against the Canal will always remain within the range of possibility , as will air attacks on a small I18 BOMBS BURSTING IN AIR scale from secretly established bases in Latin America . The best that can be done is to take every conceivable defensive measure , to try to provide against every contingency and to make the chance of success as small as possible and the risk as great as possible . The doubling of the locks , as now proposed , will make transit far more difficult to interrupt . It is to be hoped , however , that at some future date we may come to the construction of an additional canal at Nicaragua . We can not afford to take any preventable chance of our fleet not being able to move freely from one ocean to the other . We have now considered the principal forms of air attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hemisphere ; and it will be quite clear to the reader that the defense of this country is indissolubly bound up with the defense of every part of that hemisphere , in which we can tolerate no intrusion by a potential enemy . The coming of air power infuses new meaning into the military implications of the Monroe Doctrine . At present we can not be subjected to air // blackmail , because our cities and vital industrial centers are out of reach of the air weapons of any possible foe . This situation will endure so long , and only so long , as we keep the whole Western Hemisphere and its approaches free of the air bases of such foes , in whatsoever guise these bases may be sought to be established . While we can do this , we retain our freedom of action . Freedom of action is necessary to a nation which , in any contingency which may arise , desires to be able to choose its course without being dictated to or threatened by any foreign power ; but above all , freedom of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maritime . I 0 AIR POWER IN AMERICAN DEFENSE PROBLEMS WE have seen that the air power of any nation divides itself naturally into two categories : ( 1 ) The cooperation air forces which work with and directly assist surface forces . These are usually divided between army and navy . ( 2 ) The air force which may be employed on strategical ( i.e. , independent ) missions . For American considerations , we will consider first the naval aviation . Of this , the principal elements are : ( I ) The tactical air force of the fleet , consisting of bombers , torpedo planes , fighters and scouts borne in aircraft carriers , and catapulted planes ? scouts carried in cruisers and spotting planes carried in battleships . ( z ) The patrol planes , large flying boats of considerable radius of action , operating partly from shore stations but with their strategical mobility increased enormously by the use of I2I // seaplane tenders , which are really floating storehouses and repair ships . The principal mission of these planes is strategical reconnaissance over water areas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . They are , however , quite capable of performing distant bombing missions and when so used form an important element of the striking power of the fleet . ( 3 ) Marine Corps aviation , which is the cooperation air component of the Fleet Marine Force . It includes bombardment , pursuit and observation squadrons . The Army Air Corps includes three main elements : ( 1 ) Units for service with elements of ground troops ( armies , corps , divisions , Coast Artillery commands ) which generally include only observation or reconnaissance squadrons , but may , according to the needs of particular situations , include attack , pursuit or even bombardment aviation . ( 2 ) The air forces assigned to the defense of outlying possessions ? Hawaii and Panama , at present , with Alaska and Puerto Rico to be // added . These include all classes of aviation , apportioned in accordance with local requirements . ( 3 ) The General Headquarters Air Force , the main striking force for strategical missions , stationed in the continental United States . In this force the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though it includes at present pursuit , attack and reconnaissance squadrons also . The employment of these various types of aviation in the strategical situations with which we may have to deal may be briefly described as follows : The navy patrol planes will be divided between the Atlantic and the Pacific ; regardless of the immediate location of the fleet , there will always be naval patrol aviation on both coasts . In the Pacific , one example of its employment might be to set up a patrol line covering the approaches to Hawaii , operating between the outlying islands ( such as Unalaska , Midway , Wake , Johnston , Palmyra , Canton , Samoa ) in such a manner that an enemy force not in sight at nightfall could not I14 BOMBS BURSTING IN AIR be through the patrol area and out of sight beyond it at daybreak when patrol is resumed . Any enemy force discovered might be attacked by the patrol planes themselves , by surface vessels which would cooperate with the air patrol , or might also be attacked by long-range Army aviation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is established there to cover the long northern leg of the patrol line between Unalaska and Midway . The Army bombers would be able to fly directly to their target with as heavy a load of bombs as the distance permitted , and return directly to their base . This would of course presume that the target was within their radius of action . The patrol planes actually engaged in reconnaissance missions are handicapped for bombing by the need for carrying maximum fuel loads , because of the great distances they must cover and the long periods they must remain in the air . Such a patrol system would be of the greatest advantage both defensively ( i.e. , in delaying or interfering with enemy forces in the absence of the fleet ) and offensively , i.e. , in // covering the main offensive movements of the fleet . In the Atlantic a patrol system similar in principle , but even more difficult to penetrate because of the shorter distances involved , might be set up covering the approaches to the Caribbean Sea from the Atlantic . It would operate from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from Puerto Rico . A third base at the southern end of the line in the vicinity of Trinidad would greatly facilitate such operations . An Army air base at Puerto Rico will provide a long-range striking element . In conjunction with submarines operating in the narrow passages between the islands , it is not too much to say that such a system could prevent the incursion of any large enemy naval forces into the Caribbean Sea for a considerable period of time , thus enabling our fleet to arrive through the Panama Canal , refuel at Guantanamo or Panama , and take such further dispositions as might be necessary , in comparative security . The covering of the approaches to our Atlantic coast would be a matter of greater 12.6 BOMBS BURSTING IN AIR difficulty , unless we were able to obtain the use of the necessary advanced bases at New foundland and Bermuda , which , in conjunc tion with Puerto Rico and a suitable scheme of offshore patrol , would answer all practical purposes . It must not be supposed that such a scheme of air patrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the case . It is intended princi pally as a reconnaissance system , to give warning of enemy movements in order to enable the fleet or other naval forces to deal with them , and to enable Army bombers to attack them when possible . But it is liable to interruption by weather conditions , it can not function satisfactorily at night , and on the open sea it can only hinder , not stop an enemy in considerable force . The bombing plane is not an effective weapon against capital ships , save under highly favorable conditions of range , visibility and navigation . ' The tactical air force of the fleet has duties to perform as part of the fleet itself , an essential element of its composition , which need not be // described in great detail . Bombing and torpedo planes will seek to attack enemy ships ; pursuit planes will seek to protect their own bombers , as escorts , or to deliver machine-gun and light bomb attacks against the bridges , anti-aircraft guns , fire-control stations , flight decks , etc. , of enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombing attacks . Scouting planes , in cooperation with cruisers and destroyers , will undertake the duties of tactical reconnaissance . Spotting planes will observe and adjust the fire of the battleships . The operations of the patrol planes in strategical reconnaissance will of course lift a great deal of this work from the shoulders of the cruiser divisions , and thus enable the very considerable fighting power of the cruisers to be kept more nearly concentrated under the hand of the commander-in-chief , instead of the cruisers being scattered out by ones and twos over half an ocean . The Army air forces allotted to outlying possessions will have a great variety of duties to perform . Hawaii , our great outlying naval base in the Pacific , must be defended if need be for a considerable period of time against an // attack in full force , until it can be relieved . Bombardment aviation , supported as necessary by pursuit , must attack approaching enemy ships , prevent the establishment of enemy bases on outlying islands of the archipelago and assist in repelling a possible landing . Attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pursuit will try to deal with enemy bombers . Panama , which is so remote from possible enemy bases as to be difficult to attack in force , must be protected above all things against surprise . Here the role of bombardment aviation is to seek out and destroy any enemy air base which may be established in the vicinity , whether it be a land base or an aircraft carrier ; pursuit must deal with enemy bombing attacks . The covering of the fleet moving from the Pacific to the Atlantic will probably be accomplished , as already described , in the eastern Caribbean . Moving in the reverse direction , it might be necessary for the naval patrol aviation based on Panama to set up a patrol line to cover the operation , supported by Army bombers if need be . In all offshore work , the closest cooperation // between Army and Navy aviation will be required . Generally speaking , Navy aviation is better adapted for over-the-sea missions , especially against floating targets , because it can alight on any smooth water surface , because its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels , and because of the essentially naval training of its personnel . On the other hand , its reconnaissance duties and the requirements of the fleet will frequently absorb the greater part of its strength , while Army aviation , though less suited for over-water reconnaissance , can admirably perform bombing missions against a target already located . In practise , the force available for a particular job , whether Army or Navy , will be sent to do it ; and both Army and Navy aviation ought to be trained in peace-time for all possible war requirements . The present artificial restrictions which prevent Army planes from flying more than Too miles offshore are , to say the least , ill-advised . Fortunately , our Army and Navy have always worked well and successfully together in war , and we may therefore anticipate that // they will do so again in the new element where both must work in common ? the air . In defending any outlying point against air attack , the closest cooperation between both air forces and the anti-aircraft artillery would be necessary . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly be reinforced from the United States . Panama and Puerto Rico can be reached without great difficulty ; Hawaii is a little farther away , but can be reached by bombers carrying fuel instead of bombs , which can be stored in excess in the magazines of the fortress . Indeed , the continental United States forms a sort of reserve and backstop for all these positions , and within it a system of air bases , of both services , should enable our air forces to be concentrated swiftly toward any point where their presence may be needed . With mobile ground units of the Army , observation aviation is needed for reconnaissance duties and for adjusting the fire of artillery , as well as for contact and liaison duties in battle . Pursuit aviation may also be // required to deal with hostile air attacks , and attack aviation as an element of the fighting team . Whether pursuit , and especially attack aviation should be directly allotted in any numbers to corps and armies , or kept under centralized control , is a subject on which opinions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be known unless as a result of the test of actual warfare . If ever we come to a major land operation , one of the most important roles of Army cooperation air forces would be the isolation of the battlefield , the impeding of the movements of enemy reserves and counter-attacks , in which all classes of aviation may participate . Attacks on enemy land communications are usually carried out by bombardment aviation acting against such targets as bridges , docks , railway junctions , and other solid targets , while attack aviation deals with enemy forces actually on the march . Pursuit may in a pinch be employed in the latter role , though its normal activity in such situations would be to protect the other types from interference by enemy pursuit . 132 . BOMBS BURSTING IN AIR Large scale land operations , however , are likely for the United States only on two assumptions : the sending of an expeditionary force to fight on some other continent , or the defeat of our Navy and the consequent necessity of dealing with an invasion of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our common sense , the second by a proper care to maintain control of the seas which wash our shores . It is in assisting the Navy in this latter and vital role that our Army air force can make its greatest contribution to the national security ; and for this purpose , its proper and indeed paramount weapon is the long-range , fourengine bombing plane ? a type which has been developed in our country to greater perfection and higher performance than anywhere else , as peculiarly suited to American requirements . It is the independent striking force of the Air Corps , the General Headquarters Air Force , which will perform these strategical missions ; missions which may or may not be in direct support of surface forces , but which in any case must be coordinated with their operations . // This force may operate against enemy naval forces , in cooperation with naval patrol planes , as already described ; but it is safe to assert that the principal mission in war of the General Headquarters Air Force will be to destroy , in its initial stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base within reach of our shores . This mission it may and very likely will have to perform in the ocean from which the fleet is temporarily absent , as no enemy would be so foolish as to attempt such an enterprise in face of our fleet . For this purpose , we require bombers of greater radius of action , as far as we can achieve this , than any possible enemy possesses . If we remain superior in this respect , we can hope to hit the enemy before he can hit us . The very great importance of advanced bases , especially in the Atlantic , is here once more to be seen . Newfoundland is of particular importance , perhaps in conjunction with a general understanding with Canada , as covering every position from which the vital northeastern section of our country could be reached by hostile bombers . It must be remembered that in the New England States , New York , // Pennsylvania , New Jersey , Delaware , Maryland , the District of Columbia and Ohio there is concentrated about two-thirds of our heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political power , and almost half of our urban population . A strong American bombardment force on Newfoundland could assure the safety of this part of the country from air attack as perhaps no other single element of armed force could do . Failing this , there should be a large Army bombing base in northern New England , in addition to the naval air station now proposed for Quonset Point , Rhode Island . Remember that advanced bases , like longer ranging bombing planes , enable us to attack the enemy before he can do any damage to our vital centers . Labrador , Newfoundland and Greenland are at present utterly defenseless , and Canada is militarily weak to a most disquieting degree . These are conditions which we must bear in mind , and against which we ought to provide as far as we can possibly do so Pursuit aviation may afford some local // defense against air attack , as also may antiaircraft artillery , but it is more than likely that a bombing mission once launched against a target within its reach will drive home with at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to protect ourselves against air bombing is to prevent the establishment of the bases from which such attempts may proceed , or to destroy them if they are established ? and to destroy them as quickly and completely as possible . Prevention is largely the function of the navy , but may have to be undertaken by the army air force on the " defensive flank , " so to speak . While it would hardly be a practicable operation to bring the equipment for a big base across the ocean until our fleet had been disposed of , even if it were far away at the time , serious damage might be done by planes operating from smaller bases which might be established by small , quick-moving forces , or in remote regions by stealth . Destruction of such bases either in course of establishment , or afterward , will almost always be the sole responsibility of our I // air power , since no other force can strike quickly enough . In the Caribbean Sea , the completion of the naval and air bases planned for the Puerto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as far as that sea itself , the West Indian islands , and the Atlantic approaches to the Panama Canal are concerned ; though our position would be still better had we the use of Trinidad to the southward . The South Atlantic is another story , the distances from our present bases being much greater . No European power is very likely to attempt the establishment of any military or air force in South America save after having disposed of our fleet ; for the communications of such an enterprise must still run by sea . Nevertheless the possession of Trinidad would much facilitate our operations in the crucial area between the western bulge of Africa and the northeastern shoulder of Brazil ; an agreement by which we might use Brazilian naval and air bases , and even aid in establishing suitable bases in that country , would be much // more satisfactory , provided we were able to assure ourselves that such bases would be stoutly defended ? for were they to fall into hostile hands , they would be a menace rather than a help . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our diplomatic influence , backed up by our possession of adequate naval strength , to prevent any position in Africa or its adjacent islands from which such an enterprise could be launched , falling into the hands of a possible enemy power . In considering the amount of air strength which we need , it must not be supposed that we should maintain in peace time at every possible point of operations the full air complement which might be concentrated there in a particular situation , any more than we keep a full-sized fleet operating from every naval base we own . The flexibility of air power enables us to hold it well concentrated , and largely in the Continental United States ; within which we can move it as required , and from which we can throw it forward to any outlying base where it may be needed . This , // indeed , is the underlying theory of the General Headquarters Air Force ; the concentration under a single command of the main striking elements of our Army Air Corps , so that their full force can be brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any given time . Detachments , being a violation of the principle of economy of force , should be kept to a minimum , as in all military dispositions . In the case of air power , the speed and range of the weapons at its command enable this principle to be more closely adhered to than with any surface force ; provided always that bases are available for its use at every essential point . As range increases , outlying forces may be decreased to the advantage of the concentrated central force ; though it is difficult to foresee a day when there will not be a necessity for maintaining detachments at Hawaii and Panama , at least , and probably also Alaska and Puerto Rico . In all these considerations there is underlined again and again the primary importance to the air defense of this country of long-range aircraft . While discussing this matter of advanced // bases , one point can not be too strongly emphasized . All such bases must be defended , that is , must be secure against every form of attack which is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval bombardment , anti-aircraft guns and pursuit aviation against air attack , garrisons of mobile ground troops against landing forces , must always be provided . The scale of such defenses will of course be proportionate to the scale and kind of attack which must be envisaged as possible . Thus a small Pacific island , such as Midway , a point of support for patrol aviation and light surface forces , needs only a few guns and men ? enough to beat off a raiding cruiser or the planes of a small carrier ; it is not important enough to attract a greater enemy effort , but it is quite important enough to be made secure against a small-scale raid . A great base like Hawaii must be defended against the heaviest possible attack by a great joint expedition ? it requires a complete infantry division , a brigade of coast artillery , powerful fortifications , as well as a strong air component .
