YOUR KING AND COUNTRY NEED YOU ! - was the most successful British recruiting slogan of the War . It was trotted out again last week . With brass-band parades , nation-wide publicity the War Ministry launched a grimly determined campaign to enlist 10,000 recruits . <P> With 2,000,000 Britons officially " unemployed " the objective looked easy , is actually almost insurmountable . Reason : an unemployed man loafing on the " dole " is paid more than a hard-drilling British soldier . <P> So desperate is the War Ministry that parents , wives , sweethearts of likely young men are being conducted on special tours through barracks . To these ladies " the advantages of a soldier 's life " are explained . They are told that son , husband or fiance will have an equal vote with the rest of his barrack comrades as to what they shall eat . A vote against prunes , for example , will banish that fruit from Tommy Atkins ' table .                  @ @ @
