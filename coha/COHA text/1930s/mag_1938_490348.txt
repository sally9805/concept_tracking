THERE is a martial tumult in the air that may be simply spring , but may on the other hand indicate that chivalry is coming back . James Cromwell has closed his house in Miami because he has to go to Cairo to pick out tiles for his house in Honolulu . We like that . The spirit of the Round Table can never die as long as a young man feels that he must voyage fifteen thousand miles , looking for the perfect tile . We also read that The Players have adopted a club tie . It is purple and gold and black , the colors the great Booth wore when he played Hamlet . We like to dream of two old Players boys meeting in some bloody alley in Bombay or Port Said , hard pressed by the murderous dacoits -- and then the tie , the hand , the oath of fellowship , the two strong men who fight as one We are even pleased to learn that John Masefield has revived the custom of reading poetry in British public houses , waking old songs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! If anyone calls , we 'll be at the Mermaid Tavern . DOWN from Madison Avenue , where a lady may he in trade without losing her sense of fun , comes a communication ( in red ink ) from the publicity offices of Miss Virginia Vol-land , a couturier . ? " In order to be a good designer of good clothes , " it says , " it would seem necessary to be aware of the times in which these clothes are being worn . Virginia Volland is very ' aware ' and in the clothes which she has designed for thespring of 1938 she has chosen to interpret the nature of the capitalist crisis in as easy and charming a way as possible . " Going on from there , it seems that Miss Volland is offering dresses called Left Wing ( " red silk-voile evening gown worn with a flowing cape " ) , Popular Front ( " sheer silk with little detachable bibs " ) , Closed Shop ( " gayly flowered linen beach dress " ) , Social Security ( " white silk evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , each good for a chuckle from capitalist and sharecropper alike . We offer Miss Volland our stunned respect . Not since Mrs. Evalyn Walsh McLean amused the Russians by wearing the Hope Diamond has anyone of her sex seemed so keenly aware of the spirit of the time , so well equipped to expound the nature of the capitalist crisis . HE " Goldwyn Follies , " a suffi- sufficiently pleasant movie , in the digestive-aid group , contains a drop of bitter thought , as sweetest perfumes have their horrid gout of civet or musk . The author , Ben Hecht , is revolted by Hollywood formulas for human behavior . His theme is the Triumph of Common Sense . In one scene he shows us a movie producer who says , " The girl finds out the fellow has a past , see ? So she wo n't have anything to do with him . " Then Ben Hecht 's girl , speaking for Common Sense , says , " But if she really loved him , she would n't care anything about his past . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphatically in the dark . But today , in the chill before lunch , we reflected that Mr. Hecht merely gives usone formula for another . His Miss Humanity is just Miss Ben Hecht . What does a girl really do if she finds out that her young man has a past ? You ca n't tell , unless you know what girl , what young man , what past . Even then you ca n't tell . The question has no answer . There is no formula . We then had lunch , creamed sweetbreads and two cups of tea , very nice . MHE other day , at the Museum of Modern Art , we saw a letter from Mark Twain to a Mr. Kester , who in 1900 asked permission to make a play out of " Tom Sawyer .

If you wish to add people , incidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so with a free hand . My literary vanities are dead and nothing I have written is sacred to me . Sincerely Yours , S'l Clemens . " We have no idea what happened to . Mr. Kester or his play , but we are framing a copy of the letter for prominent display in our reception room , where once an editor died like a dog for taking a comma out of a couplet . JOHN PowEits , who can supply beautiful models at a moment 's notice for any respectable purpose , has his own simple definition of the dramatic artist , " When a girl gets through running the gamut of advertising emotion , " Mr. Powers told a reporter for Variety , " glowing over silverware , registering delight with new clothes , or sorrow because she failed to read the Lux ads , she 's an actress . " There are other expressions in advertising art , notably the fierce contempt of the young lady whose escort ca n't dance like Arthur Murray , but we think that Mr. Powers has the right idea . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion that is unintelligible behind the sixth row . Dose was an enigma , Bernhardt a chameleon . Joy and sorrow are enough . The joy of a girl who has just promoted a set of dishes , the sorrow of a girl who Forgot to wash her stockings . ?

" Boom INspite of the fact that the Nation- al Broadcasting Company colors up and tries to change the subject if you mention the biggest drum in the world , we think the story of the drum is one that should be told . To begin at the beginning , then , Toscanini was leading the N.B.C . Symphony Orchestra in a rehearsal of Verdi 's Requiem a couple of weeks ago , in preparation for the benefit concert at Carnegie Hall . At one point in the piece the score calls for a single boom from the bass drum  --  a very loud , resonant boom . When the time came , the drummer whang-ed into it For all he was worth . Toscanini then signalled for silence and asked the fellow , in effect , if he was a man or a cream puff . " What kind of a boom is that ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was the loudest boom he could get out of that drum . Toscanini then tried the drum himself and said he guessed that was right . " We 'll need a bigger one , " he told the N.B.C . officials who were present . The officials thereupon conferred about finding the maestro a bigger drum . " Well , " one of them said , getting right clown to brass tacks , " the University of Chicago has the biggest drum in the world . Let 's borrow that . " This was no sooner said than dune . The University officials agreed to lend the drum to N.B.C . if N.B.C . would insure it . N.B.C . did , and the drum was dispatched to New York , the sole occupant of a special express car . The biggest drum in the world , it seems , is eight feet in diameter , made of the two biggest steer hides ever found in Texas . N.B.C . ' s publicity men , learning that the drum was on the way , went down to Penn Station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call there , planning to take . the noble instrument right hack to the studio with them . However , since the drum was shipped by Railway Express , the car had to be unloaded away out in Sunnyside . Altogether , it took two N.B.C . men five hours to go out to Sunnyside , get the drum , and bring it back with them to the R.C.A. Building , where Toscanini planned to rehearse with it the next clay . Special diplomatic arrangements had to be made before the truckmen would carry the thing through the picket line from the Electrical NVorkers union , the union finally permitting it as a special gesture of regard for Toscanini . Well , you 've probably guessed the rest of the story  --  they could n't get the drum up to the studio . The doors of the freight elevator were just too small to get the drum in . Dozens of N.B.C . people worked at it from seven in the evening until almost midnight . And anyway , as the elevator operator pointed out , if they had managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have unloaded it at the eighth floor because the eighth-floor door is about a foot narrower . " Vhy did n't you measure the damn door before you brought the damn drum all the hell from Chicago ? " one official was heard to scream . Nobody could think of an answer . They did measure the door at Carnegie Hall , and found that the drum was a couple of feet too big for that , too . There was nothing to do but put it back in the express car and ship it to Chicago . For the Carnegie Hall concert , Toscanini used a moderately large drum he borrowed from the American Legion post of Greenwich , Connecticut . The hi ; drum 's transportation charges each way were $19 , based 021 the usual double-rate figure of $7.60 for every hundred pounds of " bulky articles . " Naturally enough , since the drum was the only thing in the car , " Railway Express lost money on the deal , and they 're sore . Everybody 's sore . Be sure to tune in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side , you 'll see a red one , too . " The old lady seemed to he fascinated and all during the rest of the trip kept looking out one window and then the other . After they had landed she said , while the stewardess was helping her with her things , " The young man who drove the plane is really wonderful , my dear . He kept right between those lights all the way from Washington . " Recessional FRAGMENT of conversation with a hard-times angle , overheard in front of a Sixth Avenue employment agency : " I been up there a couple of times , but they did n't have no opencies . " Mrs. Spry IF you 're planning to go to the Flower Show this year , you really ought to know something about Mrs. Constance Spry . She 's here on a visit from England , where she 's prominent in floral circles ; after officiating as one of the judges of the Flower Show , she will be the principal speaker at the banquet . From one of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lady who invented a style of flower arranging which is getting to he more and more fashionable in London . When we talked with her , in her rooms at the Gladstone , she said that this was true , that she was head of a concern named Flower Decorations , Ltd. , which employs fifty people , and is principally concerned with handling flower arrangements for private clients . This is sometimes done on a monthly or yearly basis , a representative of Flower Decorations , Ltd. , dropping in every now and then to replenish the vases ; and of course there are the arrangements for weddings and big parties . Mrs. Spry supervised the decoration for such affairs as the party Mrs. Gilbert Miller gave after the London opening of " Victoria Regina " and almost any big wedding you could mention ; Duke and Duchess of Gloucester , Duke and Duchess of Kent , Duke and Duchess of Windsor , dozens of others . Mrs. Spry , a mild , mddle-aged lady Skill WE 'VE heard a WE'V about a dear , fuzzy old lady who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an evening trip between Washington and Newark . She was a little puzzled by the green light visible from her window and finally made inquiries of the stewardess . " It 's a navigation light , " the girl told her . " If you look with short black hair and bright eyes , speaks with a slight brogue , the result of a girlhood spent in Dublin . When the Irish Rebellion broke out , she volunteered for the Red Cross and saw a good deal of active service , actually being present at the surrender of De Valera . Then she married and settled down in Kent , fifteen miles out of London . Here she had a garden and did so well with it that her neighbors began asking her advice ; finally , about eight years ago , she decided to go into the thing professionally . Now , in addition to her decorating project , she runs a school of flower arranging , with about a hundred young-lady pupils . She has also written a couple of books on the subject . She has been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden-club ladies here and there . At almost every lecture she is asked if she is a real dirt gardener . " I do n't know what other kind of gardener you could be , so I guess I am , " she answers . Mrs. Spry has no set rules about arranging flowers and has been somewhat mystified by the ones she has encountered in the States . " Not mixing wild and tame flowers , and not having flowers more than one and a half times as high as the vase  --  all Greek to me , " she told us . She feels that flower arranging over here has been too much affected by the formal restraint of the Japanese art . Vegetables and weeds play a lively part in Mrs. Spry 's arrangements . " Rhubarb , artichoke blossoms , spinach , carrot leaves , blackberries , ripe wheat , cucumbers , asparagus , berries , green tomatoes , clematis seedsall have their place in flower decorating , " she says with conviction . Mrs. Spry ca n't say enough for kale as a decorative vegetable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen measures , old china , copper pans . Once , arranging flowers for Abraham &; Straus , she laid nut a candlewick bedspread for a tablecloth , to set off her centrepiece . A. &; S. sold it the next day as a tablecloth . Visitant ONE of our more matronly readers went to tea last week at a fine new house m Scarsdale and , she reports , discovered in a coiner of the library a little Hammond electric organ . " How nice ! " she exclaimed to the lady who lives in the house . " But I did n't know you played . " The hostess said she did n't play . Our friend said of course , the children must be learning to play , and was n't that nice . " No , the children do n't play , either , " the hostess said . Then she added , beaming , " But the Fuller Brush man comes in and plays quite often . " Lepers . A NT awful lot of things can happen to you in New York , but catching leprosy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreeing that leprosy is communicable only in extreme climates , and that people in the temperate zones are safe , if they stay there . We tell you this so you wo n't he tee startled to learn that there are thirty lepers living here in the city  --  if you did n't read the fact , as we did , in " An American Doctor 's Odyssey . " They are n't segregated , and , except for periodic checkups by the Department of Health , are free to lead normal lives . There arc twenty-three men , six women , and one boy of seventeen . Fourteen of the men and all six women arc married . One of the women works as a dressmaker , the seventeenyear-old boy has a job , and the men follow all sorts of callings  --  clerking , elevator-operating , mechanics . One is a musician and another a broker . None of them , of course , are allowed to work in a place where food is handled . If there were any leprous children , they would n't be allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tutors to their homes . The Department of Health is as reticent as it can he about the lepers under its care , because public opinion of the disease is just about where it was in the Middle Ages , when anybody who developed a rash was chased out of town and never allowed to come back . Leprosy is n't , as a matter of fact , such a spectacular disease as novelists have made it . There are two types : the nodular , which results in lesions , and the anesthetic , which affects only the nervesand nerve centres . Both are present in New York , the anesthetic type predominating . They are treated about once a week , with injections of chaulmoogra oil . Three dines a year they have to report at the Department of Health Building on Worth Street for a thorough examination . If there is any indication that the patient is getting worse , he 's sent to the Federal Hospital for Lepers , at Carville , Louisiana . The Department of Health says flatly that every case in its files is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an immigrant or of an American catching it in the tropics . In some places  --  the Philippines , Brazil , Colombia  --  leprosy is endemic ; i.e. , you stand a good chance of catching it just by living there . One case ( told to us without names ) was of a man who joined the army during the Spanish-American War and was sent to the Philippines . Years later , while his doctor was making a routine examination , he detected leprosy . The man lived for a long time with his wife and family , relatively well and happy , but now he 's in a hospital . The precautions that a leper has to take when living closely with others are about those required of tuberculous people : separate sleeping rooms and eating utensils , avoidance of too close daily contact with others in the Family . The disease is not congenital , and the children of lepers remain healthy if they are properly segregated . Slight Warning WE have just heard from a young student we know who last fall did the English countryside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's home , he was confronted by a fork in the road . One branch led across a plain , the other into an inviting wood . On the road to the wood , however , was a warning : " Motor traffic on this road is hardly practicable . " National Sanctuary THE lake in Central Park near Fifty-ninth Street and Fifth has had a duck population of as high as five hundred this winter , which is a considerable increase . All the ducks you see there are wild ducks ; there is no reason they have to stay there if they do n't want to , although , of course , the feeding problem is simpler there than most anywhere else . Every morning , Mr. Joseph Isoldi , acting on behalf of the Parks Department , appears with a wheelbarrow load of corn and hunks of bread and scatters it about , and during the entire day there is a constant , if limited , contribution of peanuts . Seven varieties of duck are in more or less constant residence : mallards , shovellers , widgeon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The shoveller and the widgeon are rare fowls and made their appearance for the first time this year , to the amazement of Mr. Isuldi and other people who know about ducks . He has been the duck man in Central Park for two years , having been elevated from cleaner in the Zoo 's bird and spends his full working time after the lake and its tenants . this month is done half of the ducks will have flown north to nest , and they or others like them will return in mid-November to spend a quiet winter in the shadow of the Plaza . The rest , rebuffing nature , will stay on the lake all summer long . The permanent residents raise families , nesting an the south side of the hill that juts into the lake , which has been fenced tiff . Small boys who climb the fence are the only deterrent to motherhood , and Mr. Isoldi takes care of them . " We raised two broods of wood ducks here , " Mr. Isoldi told us , " and they 're the wildest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conies up from Fulton Street afternoons  --  a jeweller , I think he is  --  who brings fifteen pounds of shelled peanuts and all he feeds is the wood ducks . He said , ' If you get those wood ducks to raise , it 'll be a feather in your cap . ' I did , all right . " We asked Mr. Isoldi if we would he safe in saying that the same ducks who left in March would be back in November , and that opened up a subject upon which there is still uncertainty . it is Mr. Isoldi 's opinion , and also that of Head Keeper John Galm , who was called into the discussion , that a good many of the ducks do return . This question will he settled , but it will take several years . This winter the duck lake became officially a national bird sanetuary , which means that the ducks there are trapped and tagged with U.S. Biological Survey bands , upon which is stamped a number and the year . Next winter the collection of statistics on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As to whether a duck migrates at all or nat , Mr. Isoldi and Mr. Galm think it 's purely a matter of personality : depends on whether the birds have a sedentary or adventurous attitude toward life  --  something , man or duck , you 're born with , apparently . Lagniappe A WHILE ago a lady up on River-1 I side Drive ( wc promised not to use her name ) sent an order to a store in Philadelphia for some extra-fancy canned goods . The case arrived the other day with everything she had ordered , and a little something in addition . Nestling in among the soup , olives , and caviar was a small wrapped parcel hearing cancelled stamps . The lady opened it and found four hundred and fifty passes admitting bearer to all the National League baseball parks during 1938 .
