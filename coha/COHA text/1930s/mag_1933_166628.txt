ENGLAND , THEIR ENGLAND - A. G. Macdonell-Macmillan ( $2 ) . <P> Though there is little love lost between the Irish and the English , between the Scots and their Sassenach cousins there is a friendlier feeling . The English regard the Scots with mixed admiration as a nation of sturdy but unconsciously humorous characters ; the Scots view the English with more or less kindly contempt . Scottish Author Macdonell , at home on both sides of the Tweed , has written the kind of hilarious , good-natured ( i.e. flattering ) satire on England which Englishmen love . U. S. readers may enjoy it too , unless they have Irish blood in them , in which case they may be annoyed at the way Author Macdonell pulls his punches . <P> When Davies , a Welshman , and Cameron , a Scotsman , were artillery officers in France they discussed the strange nature of the English . Davies was a publisher in civil life ; he suggested that Cameron do a Scot's-eye-view book on the subject . When they met again , in peacetime London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davies reminded Cameron of the idea and he began collecting material . The more he got , the more confused he became . He played in a wild cricket match with his brilliant literary acquaintances , made one of an incongruous crowd of guests at a country-house weekend , reviewed " good " and " bad " plays for a London newspaper , acted as private secretary for a Conservative M. P. called to Geneva to serve on some League of Nations committees , electioneered , went for a Christmas holiday on a freighter , and finally discovered the timeless heart of England in the slow-changing countryside . Occasionally , as when he is portraying the asinine and brutal vulgarity of the modern young bloods and contrasting it with the traditional wisdom and courtesy of the old generation , Author Macdonell 's good nature breaks down into invective or falters into sentimentality . But most of the time he is content to point a blunt and sudden finger , raise a hearty laugh .                  @ @ @
