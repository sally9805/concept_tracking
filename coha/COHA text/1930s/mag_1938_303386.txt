THE WORLD Is MINE-William Blake-Simon &; Schuster ( $3 ) . <P> This 741-page historical melodrama about " a modern Monte Cristo " is an unusual tale . Most extraordinary thing about it is its echoes of Christina Stead 's month-and-a-half-old House of All Nations ( TIME , June 13 ) . Both novels run to about the same length , both have the same satirical , tight-nerved , epigrammatic slant on their backgrounds of international high finance , war and revolution . The World Is Mine , with a more extravagant range , livelier plot , less diffuseness , is better than Author Stead 's brilliant book . <P> Curious parallels show in the two authors ' backgrounds as well . Son of a Midwest surgeon , pseudonymous William Blake , now in his 403 , has been a broker and financial editor in Wall Street and Europe , four years ago went into the grain business in Antwerp , where Christina <P> Stead also got her detailed background material on the machinations of international speculators . <P> Whether or not Author Blake 's hero is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be called an imitation . Cristobal Hernando Pinzon , handsome , precocious hero of the tale , lives for a revenge that is all his own . At 21 , on the eve of the World War , Cristobal is a director of a Jesuit bank , making a mere $50,000 a year . At War 's end , his daring speculations have made him the richest man in the world . Meanwhile , he has helped rig a Papal election , has picked up two shady stooges and has narrowly missed marrying a rich , broad-shouldered , English adventuress . His next four affairs are merely talismans for guiding his speculations . A Russian exile 's hard-luck tales , for example , prompt him to bet on Lenin , short-sell Russian bonds at a huge profit . <P> During the dull days of post-War recovery , Cristobal goes to work on four English bankers who stole his father 's copper mine , ruins them separately with deliberately prolonged , sadistic finesse . Tuning up for the last revenge , on capitalism , Cristobal begins by short-selling the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Vanzetti , utilities in honor of Tom Mooney , and so on through all the martyrs of radicalism . Meanwhile he has married a poor , tuberculous girl , returned to Spain to finance an uprising . A hero in the first days of the Spanish Civil War , Cristobal suggests buying off the Rebels , goes down because he has held his ten-billion-dollar ace too long . <P> Like House of All Nations , The World Is Mine is a novel with an unpredictable future . Safest bet is that a few readers will enjoy its spotty but brilliant literary coloring , while the rest get the effect of a faulty spectrum that whirls out of a bad shade of red .
