The curtain rises on the scraggly ruined garden of MAJOR OLIVER 'S old Southern mansion  --  a side view which does not show the dwelling . Entrances at upper and lower Right and upper and lower Left . At the Left front is a clump of boxwood shrubbery , and in the Right Center a weatherworn little summer house , with a few rose vines growing up it and roses in early bloom . An empty rocking chair and a garden seat are beside the summer house . Projecting diagonally in at the Right rear is the corner of an iron picket fence . Behind it the gray squat shapes of two or three tombstones are seen . FRED JONES , a muscular young man of twenty-five or-six , dressed in neat homespun farm clothes , is sitting on the sill of the summer house idly strumming a guitar which he holds in his lap . Presently his voice rises into accompanying song and then dies out . JONES In half-distinguished words I looked at my father , and my father he said , O stay at home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O stay at home and cease your fret to seek a fairer land &nbsp; Way out in Texas on the old Rio Grande . I looked at my mother and my mother she saidThe aching heart within my breast is weighted down like lead , The aching heart will break to know I 'll never touch your handWay out in Texas on the old Rio Grande . He stops and sits staring before him , then lays himself back against a post , gazing up at the rose vines overhead . A moment passes and CLARA OLIVER comes slowly in at the Right rear by the cemetery fence . She carries some wild flowers in her filmy wide-brimmed hat . Stopping by the fence , she picks a few scattered daisies , then stands and stares over at the tombstones . She is a rather tall , striking young woman with a clean-cut aristocratic face , a little pensive and sad perhaps , but beautiful . Her eyes are large and dark , and her thick dark hair , piled in a coil around her head , is fastened with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dressed in her Sunday best  --  the style of the Eighties  --  a greenish sort of crispy silk , set with a delicate lace collar . For a moment she gazes at the tombstones , then moves along the rear , breaking off a bloom here and there in the garden . Coming over to the summer house , she begins gathering roses , climbing up on the old garden seat to do so . The seat creaks and FRED JONES sits up quickly and moves his guitar with a bumping sound . CLARA looks down a bit startled p. 3 CLARA In a low level voice that betrays no shadow of surpriseAm I disturbing your rest ? JONES Springing upOh , no . Stretching himself a bit . The Sunday laziness got me  --  I been sitting here  --  oh , just picking the guitar and thinking . CLARA I hope they were pleasant thoughts . She goes on plucking the roses with businesslike movements of her deft hands . JONES Well  --  yes , depending on how you look at it . Can I help you gather the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather you 'd play something . I see you have the guitar . JONES After a momentWell  --  and then maybe I 'll want to ask you a question . He looks over at her , then stands turning the guitar in his hands . That 's a good guitar you 've got . I appreciate your letting me play it while I 've been here . CLARA After another pause I told you last night it was yours . I would n't know one chord from another now . You keep it . JONES With a smileThen I suppose I would be a real tramp . And I could stop in towns , play a bit and now and then take up a collection . Please , sir , Mister , just a copper . No , you 'd better keep it . Some day you might want to play it again . Where I 'm going to it 's muscle power and not music that 's needed . p. 4 CLARA Sitting down in the rocking chair and beginning to arrange the flowers from the hatYou have n't maybe  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night ? JONES Differently how ? CLARA I  --  I thought  --  Her voice fades out and then rises again . About going on to Texas  --  I thought maybe you 'd give up the idea . JONES Good gracious ! With an abrupt laugh . I suppose it does look like that . Here I 've been camped about your house for three days  --  only fifty miles from home  --  eating and  --  CLARA InterruptingBut look at the work you 've done ! Fixed the fences , mended the barn doors . With a gesture of her hand behind her . Mowed the weeds out of the garden , cut the grass on the lawn and already made everything look  --  look nicer , much nicer . JONES Pshaw , that 's nothing . I 'd like to do a thousand times more . Turning and looking at her . Yeh , it must seem mighty queer to you that a stranger like me should stop in from a thunderstorm for an hour and stay three days . This is the fourth . CLARA No , it does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I haven  --  have n't gone on any further , Miss Clara . You know that . He stops and looks at her . CLARA Without looking upTowards Texas ? JONES Yes , towards Texas . And I was to meet some other fellows at the railroad . They 've gone . I 'm still here . CLARA MurmuringLots of people are going to Texas now , are n't there ? JONES Lots and lots of them  --  going out , taking a new start , beginning all over again . Sweeping the guitar with his hand . I 've told you that already . CLARA Only once . JONES Yes , all going on , and I 'm not gone . Here 's my money in my pocket . It 's only twenty miles more to the railroad . You must have thought  --  Oh , of course  --  I do n't mean that you 've been specially thinking about it , but it must have crossed your mind that  --  well , that if I 've really got a piece of government land waiting out there , I ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wo n't want to settle on that land . Maybe you might stay on here . Hurriedly as he is about to speak . You 've said yourself that we need somebody mighty bad to work here , to take care of things . Her voice dies out again and she sits gripping the flowers in her hand. p. 6 JONES You need somebody , all right  --  everything 's going to wrack and ruin . CLARA We would n't have much to pay you with at first . But maybe  --  JONES A cold note suddenly in his voiceBut maybe I could get along  --  yes ? CLARA Yes . JONES VehementlyYes , as a hired man . That 's what I 'm leaving from , I tell you . Gesturing behind him . Back there I was a hireling . It was one day 's work after another , all for the other man . That 's why I 'm going to Texas , going , I tell you  --  where I can be something , a free man , a man with a future , with something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the burning summer , cutting the man 's timber in the freezing winter , driving , driving at the word of command  --  moving when he said move , stopping when his whistle blew  --  seemed like sometime my mind would break all to pieces . I were n't made for a slave . Something in my heart kept pushing me up and on  --  myself , me , on to freedom . Back there the name of Jones is common as gulley dirt , but some day in Texas it 'll have a meaning . CLARA Yes , I 'm sure of it  --  JONES Are you ? p. 7 CLARA Yes , you 'll do great things out there , Fred . JONES Almost sharplyThen why do you tell me to stay here ? CLARA Oh  --  then I should n't . I 'm sorry . JONES Fiercely , half to himself No , it 's the other way round . Why have I stayed here as long as I have ? What keeps me here ? He sits looking at CLARA but she never raises her eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soon , I tell you  --  maybe today . For a moment they sit in silence . FRED watches her hands working the flowers into little bouquets . They 're purty flowers . What are they for ? CLARA For the exercises . Looking up at the sun . It 's almost time for the folks to be here . JONES AbstractedlyWhat exercises ? CLARA It 's Memorial Day and we 're having a little ceremony there in the burial ground . We always do  --  every year . JONES Hum , like a poem I once read in a school book . p. 8 CLARA SoftlyHow sleep the brave who sink to rest  --  JONES Yes , that 's the one I learned . What sort of ceremony do you have ? CLARA Very simple . Father says a few words and I 'll lay these flowers down for remembrance . JONES Of the dead ? CLARA Of the dead  --  our people . JONES It sounds sad enough . CLARA We 're proud to do it . JONES Yes , that 's just it  --  CLARA What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CLARA With a little low laughThere 's Father and Uncle Kiah and myself . And Mr. David is coming . JONES Mr. David  --  yes , he said so the other night when he was here . CLARA Since we were children together he has never missed the day . JONES He 's got a good reason . CLARA Ignoring his remarkAnd you 're invited  --  that 'll make five . p. 9 JONES Thank you . CLARA You 're welcome . With an irritated movement FRED picks up the guitar and strums it , then begins singing . JONES I looked at my sister and my sister she said , O brother mine , you 'd leave your home , your fire-side and your bed , O brother mine , but not your love for any foreign strand  --  &nbsp; &nbsp; Way out in Texas on the old Rio Grande . I looked at my lover and my lover she saidThough bitter were the road we go , the suffering on ahead , Though bitter be the road to death with you I 'd take my stand &nbsp; &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLARA After a momentThat 's nice  --  the way you sing it . JONES And I had a question to ask . As she says nothing . Do you think a woman would do that ? CLARA makes no answer . Suppose there was someone , would she go with me  --  I mean with him  --  with the man ? CLARA What do you think ? JONES I 'm asking you , Miss Clara . CLARA After a moment , looking upMaybe she could n't go , Fred . p. 10 JONES FiercelyBut she would if she loved him . In sudden alarm as he stares at her hand . Look , your hand is bleeding . He fumbles in his pockets , finally pulls out a handkerchief and comes over towards her . CLARA Her hand going out and taking the handkerchief quicklyIt 's nothing  --  one of the thorns . She wraps up her finger . I 'm  --  I 'm ruining your handkerchief . JONES SpontaneouslyOh  --  Miss Clara  --  I  --  Helplessly . But I ca n't talk to you . Sitting here last night I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off  --  He turns and grips one of the posts with his two hands , making the little summer house shiver violently . CLARA You 'll shake it down if you do n't mind . JONES That 's what I feel like doing  --  tear it down  --  gesturing around himtear it all down  --  that 's the truth  --  save you from it all  --  this rot , this death . CLARA In deep agitationYou must n't talk like that any more . You promised . FRED drops his hands from the post and stands looking off . MAJOR JOHN OLIVER enters lower Left . He is a dilapidated raw-boned man of some sixty-five or more , with a tangle of iron gray hair , deep-set fox-red eyes , a high hooked aristocratic nose , and a clean-shaven face except for a short military moustache . He is dressed in a spotless white shirt , dark trousers , and carpet slippers . He walks with the aid of a cane and carries a little book in his hand . CLARA rises. p. 11 OLIVER In a quavery punctilious voiceIt 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan , Clara . CLARA As the MAJOR sinks wearily into the rocking chair I 'll get it . OLIVER Blowing out his breathAnother hot summer , another hot summer coming on . Please lay out my uniform too , Clara . CLARA And the sabre also ? OLIVER Staring at herAnd my arms as usual . And then I want you to come back and finish that chapter in my phrenology book . CLARA Yes , Father . She goes away at the lower Left and the MAJOR sits with the book open before him . FRED still stands looking off before him , holding the guitar by the neck . The MAJOR gives him a piercing look out of his deep-set eyes and then tremblingly puts on a pair of spectacles and stares at the book . OLIVER Now looking over at FRED againPhrenology is a great science , my friend . Know anything about it ? JONES No sir , Major Oliver , I do n't . OLIVER Through cranial markings the powers and constituents of both the character and the soul are known . Now feeling the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , between the bump of wisdom and the bump of unselfishness , lies another bump , largely developed . Do you know what that might be ? FRED shakes his head and stares around at the MAJOR . Why , the bump of survival . A virtue and a power long possessed by the race of Olivers . Now closing his book and slowly taking off his spectacles . I should like the privilege of a few words with you , sir . p. 12 JONES QuietlyAll right , sir . OLIVER Lifting a long clawlike hand in the airYou will indulge me  --  an old man  --  wheezingand a very sick one . FRED lowers his head . It might interest you to know that for more than a hundred years this mansion  --  with a slight gesture towards the Left  --  a mansion known in story and song as the birthplace of statesmen and gallant soldiers  --  this mansion has long been famous for its hospitality . That being true , you must know it has grieved me no little that you , our latest visitor , have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly call me a visitor , Major . I just stopped in out of the rain . OLIVER Almost gentlyAnd the rain has been over for three days , sir . His old desolate voice now filling with a sterner , harder note . However , though you claim to be nothing but a casual caller and a stranger , your behavior the last few days argues differently for the future . You understand me ? JONES No , sir , I do n't . OLIVER Then in plainer words , my hospitality is being put to quite a strain so far as you are concerned . Now quickly . Pardon my crudeness in expressing myself . Perhaps you could state it better because of your experience as a tramp on the roads . p. 13 JONES I 'm not a tramp on the roads . OLIVER We will not debate that subtle point . JONES I reckon I understand what you are driving at . OLIVER Then very good and there is no need to pursue the subject further . JONES Yes , but there is . I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't apologize , for  --  again to speak bluntly and with pain  --  we have n't begrudged you your food , young man . For like the Samaritan in the scriptures we have never turned anyone away from our door empty-handed , though now due to the irony told of in the briefs and chronicles of history which has allowed us to be plundered by our Northern enemies , our store of goods is sorely depleted . With sudden and harsh brutality . And now that we understand each other I bid you farewell and Godspeed . With biting sarcasm . The grass-grown plains of Texas are calling you to come and help build a new and mighty commonwealth . You a budding statesman . And so I bid you good-bye  --  not today , not tomorrow , nor next day , but now . JONES I take that to mean you are ordering me off your premises , as the lawyers say . p. 14 OLIVER You catch my intent perfectly . I am . JONES All right , I 'm going , but not before I talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using my daughter 's name familiarly I 'll be driven to the necessity of getting my horse pistol from its velvet case and shooting you down like a dog . JONES AngrilyNo , that you wo n't . OLIVER Yes , but I will . In defense of my daughter 's honor  --  no  --  white trash  --  JONES I 'm not afraid of you or your name , Major Oliver . Maybe I am what you call poor white trash . Maybe my folks never lived in a great mansion like yours . We never owned Negroes and fast horses and ate the fat of the land and walked in fancy silks and laces and wallowed in the lap of love the way you did . No , we did n't . But we fought the Civil War and died at Manassas and Gettysburg and Seven Pines just the same as you . My father was killed at Cold Harbor  --  and he did n't know what he died for either . OLIVER Lifting his caneNo more of your fine words , hear me ! I 've had enough these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at your daughter . She milks the cow , feeds the pigs , does the work of a Negro . Here in poverty you sit , grinding out her life . What chance is there for her here in this God-forsaken place ?  --  I tell you  --  He looks off at the Left , and suddenly stops as CLARA comes in with a palm leaf fan which she hands to the MAJOR . She also carries a book under her arm. p. 15 OLIVER With gentle dignityThank you , my child . Cocking his head and listening . I hear old Tom whinnying down at the barn . With a look up at the sun . Time to feed him . CLARA To FREDWill you please attend to him , Fred ? JONES Conscious of the tone of her voice I 'll tend to him , Miss Clara , this last time . CLARA In the same level voiceThank you . I pulled some grass for him . It 's in the harness room . Get it . As FRED starts away . He should have water too . JONES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clara . He goes quickly out at the lower Right . CLARA stands looking after him . The MAJOR observes her out of the corner of his eye for a moment . OLIVER Sit down , Clara . CLARA As if suddenly waking upHow 're you feeling today , Father ? Turning and then looking at him as he gazes back at her . Did you sleep well ? OLIVER Oh  --  yes  --  well . Changing his tone with an effort . I 've just got up . p. 16 CLARA Then you 've had a long rest . I tried to keep quiet and not wake you . OLIVER I was already awake at daybreak and heard you tiptoeing about the house  --  at daybreak and it Sunday , Clara . A testy querulous note in his voice . So you went to church this morning ? CLARA Her deep throaty voice as always gentle and unhurriedYes . OLIVER Did they all gather around you and pray for you and for my sinful soul ? CLARA No , Father . Turning towards the MAJOR . Can I fetch you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And who was there  --  at the church ? CLARA A lot of people . OLIVER Strange people ? CLARA Yes , to me they were . OLIVER Aye . Muttering . Every time you turn around there 's another poor white born . They breed like flies . Like the locusts of Egypt they swarm over the world . CLARA I hardly knew anybody  --  neither the young nor the old . OLIVER With a chuckleNow they 'll have something to tell their children  --  how the proud lady came down out of her ivory tower and went searching for  --  well , for what ? p. 17 CLARA Oh , I was out walking and stopped in . When the singing began I slipped off and came back home through the woods . I did n't stay . OLIVER You did n't ? CLARA No , Father . MusingEverything was so green and lovely . OLIVER At the church ? CLARA In the woods . OLIVER A light jeering note in his voiceGreen and beautiful and the birds were singing there . CLARA Yes . Simply . And two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I watched them . OLIVER Did you see Sir Galahad come riding through the forest  --  his heart full of poetry , his face  --  CLARA No , Father . OLIVER No , Father .  --  Yes , Father ! Gasping . Lord ha ' mercy , Clara ! CLARA I guess it was just a whim  --  my going . OLIVER People have whims when they are  --  hum !  --  Maybe that 's why I have my tantrums  --  just to keep myself company , eh , Clara ? There are a lot of queer dark things down inside of a human being , ai n't they ? p. 18 CLARA Lifting her dark eyes and studying her father 's faceMaybe , Father . OLIVER Maybe ! Loudly . You  --  yes , how should you know ? Staring at her and then as if suddenly reciting . Over there somewhere in the darkness things shape themselves and come to their appointed season . Striking the arm of the chair with his fist . But the proud shall keep their pride till the crack of doom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was Henry Tompkins at church ? CLARA Yes , he was there . OLIVER And I bet he fell out of his seat when he saw you . With a bitter laugh . A deacon and a holy man with money in the bank and  --  and a mortgage on all this . He sweeps his lean arm inclusively over the scene . Rot his soul ! He used to be sweet on you , Clara . When we 'd drive into town and buy something at his store he 'd fasten his eyes on you . And he 'd been a bound boy to my father ! But when I got through telling him where his place was , I reckon he took his eyes off you . Oh , yes he did , did n't he ? As CLARA says nothing . I say , did n't he ? CLARA SoftlyYes . Lifting her eyes . Is it true he 's rich now ? p. 19 OLIVER VehementlyAnd with a fat wife ! Ha-ha-ha . She revenges us on him . His face is suddenly caught in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leg . That leg seems like a piece of wood . Wish sometimes I could take my pocket knife and cut the thing off . CLARA Half-risingCan I get you a poultice OLIVER SharplyIt never does any good . After a moment . Go ahead and read me my book now . CLARA Sitting down and opening a thick volumeI thought you 'd maybe like this . OLIVER Looking over at herNot if it 's one of Scott 's novels  --  no , you need n't read it . CLARA Yes , but you 'd like it  --  you would this one . It tells about a lady and a  --  OLIVER No , I would n't like it . That 's one thing wrong with you , Clara , reading so much trash about romantic people that never lived . Quit it  --  hum !  --  Your grandfather went back to Scotland once to see the old castle that belonged to our family . A great party was given for him , and Walter Scott was there . CLARA Opening the phrenology bookYes , I know . It 's mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know what Scott told your grandfather . That 's not mentioned . CLARA With sudden interest . No , what was it ? OLIVER CacklingHe said , " Colonel Oliver , there never were such characters as those I write about . But people are full of dreams and strange fancies and so they like to think there were . " That story of the high-born lady and the low-born man ai n't true , you see . No , you need n't read it . CLARA With sudden directnessWhy are you talking to me like this , Father ? OLIVER Oh , just for some reason  --  no matter . Anyway I 've heard your grandfather tell it more than once . CLARA Lifting the book and suddenly beginning to read in a childlike half-literate way " Doctor Vermont thinks tha the space between **27;3360;TOOLONG and self-esteem includes two organs . " OLIVER GruntingGreed , he means  --  thievery ! CLARA Staring at him an instant and then continuing " The lower of these organs I found large in certain birds of prey  --  " p. 21 OLIVER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . CLARA " Using this as a basis , I compared my findings with certain human characteristics of the lower classes in the South , especially the poor whites  --  " OLIVER Who says that man do n't know what he 's talking about ? Leaning towards CLARA . These people think the hand that turns the great wheel  --  like the Greeks  --  it 's bearing them up  --  up  --  and us down .  --  Fools ! CLARA Reading , the pitch of her voice a bit higher " In boys this organ frequently indicates itself in attachment to dogs , horses , rabbits , birds and other animals . In girls it shows itself by affectionate embraces of the doll . " OLIVER Muttering in recitation againThere 's a dark army rising in the west . Yes , let the white and shining soldiers assemble on the plain with their lightning and their brimstone . They 'll be needed . CLARA SmilingYou sound like the book of Revelation , Father . OLIVER I , John , on the Isale of Patmos , I dream my dream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doodles singing under the sills , with their dry traps set for the unwary ants , and you and me two spits of white bait in the deadfall of death . That 's what they say  --  hah-hah-hah  --  but we 'll fool ' em , wo n't we , Clara ? Fool both the doodles and the white trash. p. 22 CLARA Turning and laying her hand gently on her father 's armFor goodness sakes , Father . OLIVER As she leans towards him I always like it  --  hum  --  that custom of putting lavender among folded clothes  --  it should never die out . CLARA No , it should n't . OLIVER And it wo n't as long as you live , I know it wo n't . Looking off at the Left . There comes David now . Half-gasping . Listen , Clara , I ca n't last much longer , you know that . Most any time now the doctor says . Most any time , and I 'll be gone . CLARA makes a gesture to interrupt him , but he hurries on . Tomorrow 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about David I want to talk with you . About David . CLARA In a low voicePlease , Father . OLIVER Ten years he 's been coming here  --  ten years . There 's nobody else for you , Clara .  --  Nobody but David . Through him our line will continue .  --  Listen , child , listen to me  --  you promised him  --  promised his father the General before he died  --  you 've promised me . Why do you keep waiting , waiting  --  why ? CLARA Please , Father . p. 23 OLIVER Trying to control his feelingsYes , please , please , please , Father . Something has come over you lately  --  Clara  --  I  --  DAVID HAYES comes in from the lower Left . He is an unimpressive young man of about thirty , somewhat slender and effeminate and dressed out in the neat but poor best of his times . His collar  --  high up under his chin  --  is set off with a thick black bow tie , and the lapel of his well-worn broadcloth coat is adorned with a dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands are thin and delicate as a woman 's .

You been keeping well , David ? HAYES Yes , sir ; same as usual . Fine day for the exercises . OLIVER Perfect . Heaven sends its benediction . HAYES It does . Feeling in his pocket . Here are the flags , Clara . CLARA What flags , David ? As DAVID gives her a perplexed glance . Oh , the memorial flags . Thank you . p. 24 HAYES Yes , the memorial flags . Would you think I 'd forget ? He pulls out a paper parcel and reveals a few tiny Confederate flags and hands them to her . OLIVER Helping himself up to a standing positionI 'll go in now and get dressed . CLARA Rising alsoI 'll help you , Father . OLIVER No , no , you children stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you , Clara . Moving away at the Left and beginning to quote oratorically towards his coming speech . In me you see the last syllable of recorded time . But still I can go under my own power . Murmuring . Strew on them roses , roses , and never a spray of yew  --  He goes on out . HAYES After a moment in a low voiceHe 's getting feeble , Clara . CLARA makes no reply but stands looking at the ground . CLARA Suddenly in an agitated voiceYes . I try not to notice it , but he is . She shakes her head as if warding off an unpleasant thought and then sinks down into the rocking chair . David takes his seat on the garden bench , holding his hat quietly in his hand. p. 25 HAYES PresentlyI want to talk to you , Clara . CLARA With a nervous start of her handsNot today  --  ah  --  later we 'll talk . HAYES Why , you do n't even know what I 'm going to say .

CLARA Please , David  --  HAYES His shyness and hesitating manner now revealing a doggedness of purpose we might not have suspectedNo , I 've got to say it . After a pause . Your father wrote me a letter yesterday . CLARA Gazing at the flags in her handsThat 's strange . HAYES It 's not strange , not now . And we 've got to settle something soon  --  Clara . p. 26 CLARA AgitatedPerhaps next week or the next  --  perhaps  --  HAYES Shaking his headWe 've been engaged a long time , Clara , and  --  CLARA Trying to control her voice I know how you feel , David  --  know how Father feels .

CLARA I mean I 'm beginning to see maybe how wrong we 've been . HAYES Always gentle and calmWrong about what , honey ? CLARA Our ideas  --  yours  --  mine  --  Father 's  --  all of us . Maybe we 've got the wrong point of view about life  --  She suddenly stops as old KIAH comes feeling his way into the yard at the lower Right , poking his stick out in little inquiring pecks as he walks . He is a wrinkled ebony-black little Negro of seventy or more in whom is concentrated all the dignity of speech and manner belonging to the ancient race of Olivers .

CLARA Yes , Uncle Kiah . KIAH Ole Missus used to like flowers  --  flowers  --  she was a flower herself . Like  --  like a jonquil by the river bank .

Sharply . Why do n't you go into town and get you a job ? Yes , become a clerk in the store , anything but do something to make a living ? p. 29 HAYES DefensivelyI guess I do n't beg from anybody . CLARA No , you do worse than that . You 've mortgaged away the last acre of the old General Hayes estate and lived on it for the last fifteen years . Just the way Father has . HAYES Staring at herWhat has come over you , Clara ? CLARA I told you I 'd been thinking . And I see we 've been going under in the fight . We have n't been facing the facts . HAYES What fight  --  what facts ? CLARA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fight . Did n't everything look hopeless when the carpet-baggers were down here ? But we run ' em out . Did n't the niggers try to cut up and did n't our Ku Klux put them in their places ? Yes , we 're not down and out , not by a long shot . And we 'll get the best of these poor whites yet  --  CLARA More quietly nowMaybe it 's the same with nations and states as it is with people . We talk of the old South . It 's dead , dead in its tracks and the Civil War killed it . But we 've never acknowledged it 's dead . And why ? Because we ca n't forget it 's past . We ca n't forget what it once did or was supposed to have done . And you and I will never amount to anything till we 've turned our backs on our history and set our faces to the future , to work and plan , to build things the way people out in  --  in Texas are doing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , David . That time I visited Cousin DuBose Hampton down there  --  p. 30 HAYES And what things are you talking about building ? CLARA Roads , schools , hospitals ,  --  cities  --  great farms  --  HAYES His voice cold and almost sharpYou must think my memory 's mighty short , Clara . Night before last I sat right here and heard that good-for-nothing Jones fellow dealing out the same sort of talk to the Major . Talk , talk , nothing but talk , and he 's still hanging around here , too trifling to go on wherever he 's supposed to go . Yes , such folks can run their tongues all right but nothing else . And if the South is dead now as you say it is , it 's because the kind of people like this Fred Jones and Henry Tompkins have got control of things . But it 's not dead , I tell you . CLARA That 's right , they 've got control , and you know why ? HAYES By crookedness and meanness and cunning , that 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  cutting down the forests , building cheap houses , gutting and slaughtering the land  --  money , money . CLARA Shaking her head firmlyNo , because of their belief in the future . We believe in the past . HAYES TriumphantlyBut you 'll never believe in their future  --  you and I wo n't  --  their future of ugliness and ignorance and low taste . Pleadingly . I love you , Clara . I 've always loved you , always will . It may be ten years I 've been coming here . All right , I 'll keep coming ten more . You say you 've been thinking . So have I. You 'd try to break me down with arguments , would n't you , but you ca n't . Now half-angrily . I can meet you , argument for argument , point for point . And I will go on and on being myself to the end , and so will you be , you and I , for we are alike . We are the old South . In us lives the heritage of grace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the last though we starve . And we belong to each other . We ca n't escape being what we are . And we ca n't escape our duty . Though it be a cross we still would have to bear it . p. 31 CLARA Staring out across the sceneSometimes I think you do n't really love me , David . No , maybe you 've never loved anybody . You love nothing but your  --  but your pride and what it stood for , your people , our people  --  their dead symbols  --  gesturing towards the Right  --  the way I 've loved  --  loved them out there in their graves . Her voice rising again . Why , you can read in the papers , see pictures in the papers , of old mansions all up and down the South , in Georgia , North Carolina , South Carolina , Virginia , everywhere , that are rotting away in decay . Negroes are living in some of them , and in others nothing but the bats and the owls . Gesturing to the Left . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will in your father 's house , and then some day a fire will burn it down , and then the axes of Henry Tompkins ' tenants will be laid to the trees . And the fields will take them in , and corn and cotton will grow where once they stood . That 's the truth , David . Her voice rising more vehemently . All these years I 've been working here , working and slaving to keep our heads above water . Day after day hearing Father pour out his hopeless bitter grieving and at night lying awake , lonely , lonely and everywhere around me feeling the slow rotting of life , the dull thud of the dead limbs falling out of the trees . Everything dissolving , failing , giving way . Her voice almost a cry . And I want to live  --  live  --  somewhere  --  somehow I do . p. 32 HAYES These are fine words and fancies from a beggar . Sadly . Well , it 's a cheap thing to do , Clara , and not like you at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's too proud to talk to you the way I 'm having to . It would kill him to hear you now .  --  Pride ? All right , I am proud . And I 'll keep my pride . I wo n't go around hobnobbing with riffraff and licking the shoes of people that come pushing their way up in the world . No , I wo n't . Let them swirl up around me . But I 'll keep my head above them and help you to keep yours . Smiling at her warmly . That 's how much I love you . CLARA PresentlySo together you and Father would keep your power over me ? HAYES Yes , if you put it that way . CLARA And I 'm a prisoner , as it were ? HAYES No , we are only protecting you , as all true men protect the women they love . CLARA Her voice almost a cryI ought to  --  if I only had the strength to go away ! Pleadingly . Help me , David . HAYES But you 'll never go away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Never . I know you , Clara , and you ca n't break away . Something holds you here as strong as life . p. 33 CLARA Strong as death . Almost whispering . It is death . Suddenly the air is rent by the MAJOR 'S voice in a sharp command off at the Left . OLIVER Attention ! CLARA Springing instinctively upThe flowers  --  HAYES See , that 's it  --  that 's it . You jumped to your feet  --  everything else forgot  --  in your duty . Ah , Clara , you ca n't fool yourself , a self that belongs with its every heartbeat to your past , our past and to our families . And that 's what you 'll do , Clara  --  remain true to them . Like your mother , my mother , and all the great and noble women who have stood untouched by defeat and despair  --  you will never shirk  --  you will never  --  FRED enters at the lower Right . CLARA In deep agitationStop  --  please stop it , I tell you ! I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards them . JONES Stopping in front of her and staring at DAVIDNo , she wo n't shirk anything .  --  Will you , Miss Clara ? HAYES With lofty and crushing coldnessYou are not concerned in this . p. 34 JONES She can decide that . HAYES You ca n't possibly understand what we  --  JONES SharplyI guess I do . But you ca n't  --  you with your eyes blinded and your pride high up to heaven . HAYES LoudlyWe excuse you , young man . Leave us alone . JONES BoldlyNot yet you wo n't excuse me . Turning to CLARA as DAVID looks on in amazement . And there 's no use waiting any longer to decide things . CLARA 'S hand goes out in a strange fumbling gesture and then drops to her side . You already know that . And all the things we 've talked about these few days  --  you know them  --  you remember . CLARA In almost indistinct voice I remember . HAYES Starting forwardClara  --  JONES Hurrying on vehementlyAnd it 's one against the other now  --  the old against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be  --  which it 's to be for you , not for me . Gesturing around the scene . Is it to be this  --  or out there  --  out there together where life will be hard , but where we will live , live ? p. 35 HAYES Taking CLARA by the armA beggar 's life .  --  Come , Clara . JONES RoughlyBut not a beggar 's death . And now the MAJOR 'S voice breaks across the scene , nearer at hand . OLIVER Attention ! HAYES They 're ready , Clara . He hands her the flowers which she takes abstractedly . JONES BitterlyYes , flowers  --  graves  --  exercises over the dead . Ah , Clara , but you 'll not give in to it . What is this empty duty they talk about , when I love you ? All these days you 've seen it in my eyes  --  felt it shaking in my voice . Hesitating an instant and then plunging on . Here looking at you now , I worship you . The day I came to the door and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so beautiful  --  so lonely and so beautiful . Yes , let him listen , I do n't care if he hears me , if the whole world hears me . HAYES You  --  you  --  JONES Ignoring himAnd I 've taken these few days of joy  --  of joy and wonder being near you  --  saying tomorrow I 'd go  --  tomorrow . But tomorrow passes and I 'm here . Then yesterday when you asked me to stay and work for you  --  yes , be a hired man  --  I felt ashamed  --  ashamed for you that you had asked me , ashamed that I had wanted to stay . And a moment ago you spoke to me like a hired man . Now I ca n't stay here any more ,  --  and you will have to decide for me or against me  --  yes , for yourself or against yourself . That 's what it means . DAVID suddenly releases CLARA 'S arm and turns around towards the rear . FRED moves to her , taking her hand in his , the flags falling unnoticed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman now , a woman I love . All the pride and glory that 's come down to you out of your history  --  all the honor and the names cut on them monuments and the flags and the flowers mean nothing to me . It 's you I love , and it 's you that will stand with me  --  out there in Texas the way the song says ? For a moment he gazes at her , his eyes searching her face. p. 36 CLARA Turning helplessly towards the LeftWe 're ready , Father . FRED looks at her , then turns angrily and despairingly away . The old MAJOR comes slowly into the scene from the lower Left , gripping his walking stick in one hand and a long sabre in the other . He is wearing the hat and full field coat of a Confederate Cavalry Major , below which show his jeans and carpet slippers . He stops and turning halfway around raises his sabre in a trembling salute . Old KIAH comes slowly in , his head lifted , the butt of a flagstaff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Confederate Stars and Bars flowing down almost to the ground . DAVID turns back and picks up the little Confederate flags , his thin face pallid and cold . OLIVER In a stern voiceClara ! CLARA turns quickly towards him , lifting her chin in the air . KIAH Us presents the colors , sir . OLIVER Sticking the point of his sabre sharply down into the groundThe Confederate flag  --  the Southern Cross ! KIAH stops in front of him . CLARA holds her flowers up and DAVID steps over and takes his place by her side , his hat in his hand . For a moment there is a pause . The MAJOR turns and looks at CLARA. p. 37 CLARA As if prompting him , her voice colorless and deadAt Gettysburg and Shiloh Field  --  OLIVER At Gettysburg and Shiloh Field in Pickett 's charge we followed  --  He stops . CLARA Now with a touch of feeling creeping into her voiceOn this day  --  OLIVER We lift this banner again over those who sleep in the hallowed earth , baptized in blood , the symbol of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty done . He begins to move along towards the Right . KIAH and the others follow him . He continues speaking . In the thunder of the battle , the bellow of the guns , the frightful carnage and the alarm of the war , thy bright colors were never dim . As the poet has so fitly said : " Long days and nights , long years have fledAnd grass grows green upon the gravesOf these immortal sacred deadWhere their proud banner waves . " He leads the way on out at the lower Right , opens a little gate , and enters the cemetery . Old KIAH follows close behind him and CLARA and DAVID in succession . The little cortege stops and stands before the graves . A moment passes and there is no sound as the men stand uncovered and CLARA bows her head . In the foreground FRED , as if unconsciously impressed by the scene , slowly removes his cap. p. 38 KIAH His voice breaking clearly over the sceneOnce more , Massa and Missus , here we is . OLIVER Quavering and oratoricalAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sunny South , furled midst blood and tears . KIAH In the deep earth , the bright sun shining round you , kin you hear us speaking to you ? FRED looks about him , suddenly realizes he has his cap off , pulls it quickly on and goes away at the Right . OLIVER Long , long is stilled the musket 's rattle and hushed is the beat of the warlike drum . KIAH Mumbling in responseAye , Lord , Lord Jesus . OLIVER But while life is to us the living , we shall never cease respect and honor to the dead . In a voice choked with emotion . And now we 'll place the flowers around and set the flags upon their graves . Once more there is a moment of silence as CLARA goes about dropping roses and DAVID sets up the flags . KIAH IntoningWith this flag and flowers we freshen up your poor graves . Strew ' em round about , honey , round and about . p. 39 OLIVER And on the Last Day before the Bar of God , Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause . KIAH In a voice sanctimonious and deepAye , Lord , plead they cause . OLIVER And death shall not be died in vain and broken hearts shall be eased and hopes that flourished green like the bay tree in a weary land shall stand exalted again . He leads the way farther into the burial ground , with KIAH and DAVID following , until they have all disappeared . CLARA remains behind bowed over her mother 's grave . And now her handkerchief goes up to her face and her shoulders shake with silent weeping . KIAH Floating back through the scene in a half-singing chantOut of these ashes , Lord , out of this dust , these that sleep gwine rise again . OLIVER And once more  --  fair like the day  --  DAVID suddenly comes back into the scene and stands by CLARA . KIAH The dead do n't suffer , they make no moan . These that sleep gwine rise again . HAYES Reading from the tombstones " Clara Hampton Oliver , Born February 3 , 1843 , Died April 10 , 1876 . Devotion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OLIVER Returning nearerNow to thy deep untroubled sleep we leave thee . He comes slowly back into the scene , his sabre trailing weakly on the ground . He stops by CLARA and his hand goes out and rests on her shoulder . Ah , my child , your mother 's happy there in yonder world where she abides  --  knowing that we never forget her  --  that our tears will forever keep her memory green . CLARA In a low convulsive moanFather . OLIVER His voice quiveringAnd she looks down upon us  --  blessing us  --  saying be of good cheer  --  be not faint-hearted  --  stand  --  He sways with weakness . DAVID takes him by the arm as he draws himself up more strongly . Stand firm  --  I  --  Help me into the house , David . DAVID with a long look at CLARA 'S bowed head , turns and helps the MAJOR across the scene . HAYES SoftlyShe 'll stay now . They go on out at the lower Left . A moment passes and FRED enters at the Right front carrying a strapped blanket roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over at CLARA 'S bowed figure . His face stern and determined. p. 41 JONES Presently calling to herClar  --  Miss Clara . She stirs slightly but remains with her head bowed . Ah  --  and maybe there 's no use talking , talking any more and begging and torturing you  --  is there ? I say , is there ? She makes no reply . A tremor of anger and bitterness rises in his voice as he goes on . Ah , cold and dead you stand there . And cold and dead was your hand when I held it . It had no life , no feeling for me . But there 's life out there  --  down the wide road that waits and calls for us . We would find it , Clara . For the last time I ask you . She is silent . Proud  --  proud . Well , I 've got my pride too and I wo n't keep begging like a dog for a morsel he 'll never get . No , that I wo n't . CLARA In a muffled voicePlease leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now it is . JONES Aye , and then I will . Nothing can keep me here  --  not even you . I wo n't stay here to be dragged down , sunk to the bottom to rot and die . Helplessly . But what joy will there be in my heart in the days to come  --  always remembering you here alone , you here by yourself walking among the shadows with the hunger of life upon you ? That 's how it will be . I know it . CLARA FeverishlyI do n't listen to him , Mother  --  I do n't listen . Forgive me , forgive . p. 42 JONES Then talk , talk to the hollow grave and let it answer . So they take you , these mighty all-powerful dead , and I am nothing before them . All the life beating in me and calling to you makes no difference . Loudly . Then I tear it all out of my heart . I trample upon these days and walk that road alone . I can do that . Good-bye . I say good-bye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He flings the blanket roll up across his shoulders and turns swiftly away . At the summer house he stops , hesitates , and then picks up the guitar . I 'll take this with me like you said . Yeh , I 'll play it to ease my heart when I remember . He goes out at the Right . CLARA continues standing bowed over her mother 's grave . After an instant of silence old KIAH comes back into the scene bearing the flag before him . KIAH That you , Little Missy ? I 'd better bring the flag in from the dews and damps . CLARA As if to herselfYes , that 's right . KIAH Everything was carried off fine , ma'am . It was a noble speech the Major made to the flag and to the blessed dead folks . CLARA Yes , yes . KIAH And they 'll rest better there knowing we remember . p. 43 CLARA Yes , that 's right . That 's right maybe . KIAH Now moving through the little gate and stoppingAh  --  standing there in the graveyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the drive , Missy , and the old Colonel was saying , " Light , folkses , and come right in . " Then I hear him say again  --  " Kiah , go hold the horses . " And I went and held ' em , and they chomping they bits and shaking they heads and pawing the ground . FRED is heard singing in the distance . CLARA Listen , Kiah , listen . You hear it  --  that song on the road ? KIAH Shaking his headNo 'm , I do n't hear it . But I can see  --  see old Missus , spry as a bird , come running out to meet the company . And the big fire would be jumping in the chimney upstairs , and the holly and the mistletoe hanging on the wall  --  yes 'm . Shaking his head . Ah  --  yes , Little Missy  --  joy and the light and the old days done gone . Music and the singing gone . CLARA Her voice wrung in a low cryAh , Kiah . KIAH Let grief and stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flag back into the house now . Put it by till another year , another year . Us got to be true to the end . Come on , Little Missy . CLARA turns and moves slowly out through the little gate and across the scene to the Left . Old KIAH follows after . DAVID enters to meet her . Without a word he places himself by her side , and they go on towards the house . Behind them goes old KIAH , with the Southern Cross held aloft and enfoldingly over them.
