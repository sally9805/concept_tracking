No voice protested at first , when the Pittman neutrality bill proposed to shackle U. S. citizens with 3,500 words that added up to " Stay home under penalty of the law . " But loud was the squawk from the shipping tycoons when they found that the bill would straitjacket U. S. shipping into immobility . While Washington wits called Nevada 's Key Pittman a Thalassaphobe , and hinted the next step would be to make offshore swimming illegal , ship lobbyists got busy on sympathetic Senator Josiah W. Bailey of North Carolina ( TIME , Oct. 23 ) . <P> Last week Bailey ( Commerce Committee chairman ) , Pittman and other Senate shipping buffs got together , unlaced the jacket . The U. S. merchant marine was to have been confined to the Western Hemisphere ; under the new amendment U. S. ships may carry nonwar supplies 1 ) to all ports in the Western Hemisphere south of 30 north latitude ; 2 ) to any port in the Pacific or Indian Oceans , including the China Sea , Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounds all North Atlantic shipping routes ( including that to Canada via the Gulf of St. Lawrence ) and may extend the prohibited areas wherever War II extends . <P> Off the Fence . This shipping compromise was Horse Trader Pittman 's second gift horse of the week . Gift Horse I was the abandonment of the 90-day credit clause for a policy of strict cash-on-the-barrelhead . Sly Mr. Pittman had timed his offerings nicely : wavering Senators popped off the fence in jigtime . Fence-perched Gillette of Iowa went over to the Administration side ; so did Kentucky 's new Junior Senator Chandler and Illinois ' Lucas . <P> Still the Isolationists struggled on , insisting on the closest inspection of the gift horses ' teeth . For four and a half hours West Virginia 's Rush Dew Holt bellowed opposition , drawing breath only to mimic stridently Franklin Roosevelt 's Groton-Harvard accent and inflection . North Carolina 's Reynolds charged that Stalin sank the Athenia . But only the stubbornest Senate orator could ignore the fact that the galleries lay almost empty day after day . Nobody came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flocked to see Fritz Kuhn before the Dies Committee . This week the Senate got ready to shift its burden to the House . Its own show was running out . <P> On the Cards . While the galleries were growing bored with the Great Debate , the public was also shifting in opinion . In its November issue FORTUNE 'S Survey found : 1 ) that U. S. sentiment favoring equal treatment of all belligerents had increased by from 54% in September to 67% in October ; 2 ) that approval of the President 's foreign policy had declined from 69.2 to 56.2% ; 3 ) that belief in Germany 's chances of winning the war had increased from 8.3 to 15.3% ; 4 ) that 84.3% of U. S. citizens want the Allies to win ( 83.1% in September ) . <P> The Gallup poll similarly reported : 1 ) sentiment that the U. S. should fight Germany , if the Allies appear to be losing , dropped from 44% in the first week in September to 29% last week ; 2 ) 84% in the U. S. want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. should do everything possible to aid the Allies " short of war " ; 4 ) 60% believe the arms embargo should be repealed .
