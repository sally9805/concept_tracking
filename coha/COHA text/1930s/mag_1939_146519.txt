Progressive architects regard the capital of the U. S. A. as a gleaming shirt front , dignified but stuffed . During its last great construction years the design of Government buildings was a monopoly of a few urbane neoclassicists , notably the late Cass Gilbert ( Supreme Court , U. S. Chamber of Commerce ) and the late John Russell Pope ( Archives Building , National Mellon Gallery ) . Last week an open architectural competition brought forth the first modern design ever chosen for a national building in Washington . Its subject : a new Smithsonian Gallery of Art . <P> Since 1906 the nationally owned Smithsonian Institution has had a Gallery of Art , but it is wedged into the massive , domed Natural History Building , the Institution 's principal monument . Function of the new gallery is primarily to house and exhibit art owned by the Government , including presumably the immense quantities lately accumulated by the Treasury and the Federal Art Project . <P> Congress last year named to the Smithsonian Gallery of Art Commission a number of political and artistic heavyweights headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairman of the National Capital Park &; Planning Commission . Appointed professional adviser was liberal Dean Joseph Hudnut of the Harvard School of Design . Granted an appropriation of $40,000 and all aglow with its opportunity , the Commission made no bones about what was required : a museum of modern art for Washington . <P> From 408 competing designs the jury first chose ten finalists , allowed them five weeks to refine their work , then last week sweated for three days to pick the winner . Not only architecturally but politically popular , it was a design submitted by debt-paying Finland 's clearheaded , apple-cheeked Eliel Saarinen , his broad-shouldered , brilliant son , Eero , and his son-in-law , Robert Swanson , all of Cranbrook Academy , Michigan . Professor Hudnut called the prize-($7,500)-winning design " well organized , logical and reasonable . . . yet with classical feeling . ... " <P> About 250 feet long , five stories high , with two main wings parallel to the main exhibition building and a glass and marble fagade , the proposed Gallery is without frills except for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its site will be a two-block plot of ground on the Mall directly-and dramatically-opposite Jack Pope 's National Gallery , now in construction-a $9,000,000 pantheon with marble wings . Cost of the functional Smithsonian Gallery of Art ( which Congress has not yet appropriated ) : $1,500,000 . <P> <P> *Harvard 's Walter Gropius , Chicago 's John Holabird , Boston 's Henry Shepley , Philadelphia 's George Howe , and Chairman Delano.
