txt When the Committee of Fourteen ras organized twenty-five years , go the notorious Raines law hotels sere in their heyday . The Bowery ras still the Bowery . The Flea tag , Scotty Lavelle 's and Big Jack ' orgie 's were catering unrestrained sailors . Chinatown was wide pen . Paddy Mullin 's , Nigger like 's , Tom Lee 's and Al Russell 's Dry Dock " were running full blast . OSIE HERTZ , " Queen of the Dive : eepers , " had managed to obtain an injunction to restrain the police front interfering with her . On the streets of the lower east side and the " Tenderloin " commercialized vice had hardly felt the restraining hand of law . Ten years later the committee was able to report a great change The Raines law hotels had been put out of business , the resorts of the lower east side had been cleaned up , ' Mayor GAYNOR 'S ? " outward order and decency " . prevailed even in the Tenderloin . Resort keepers and police alike were coming to realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although by 1915 vice had begun to show its head in new places , especially in tenements and cabarets , conditions . improved steadily until 1920 . With the coming of prohibition the oldtime saloon went out of business , and it was some time before the speakeasies came to take its place . After 1921 conditions began to grow worse . The old alliance between vice and liquor returned . Mr. WORTHINGTON , secretary of the committee , thinks the most evil influence of the present day is the " speakeasy club , " distinguished from the old cabaret and the more modern night club by the fact that it is organized for the purpose of engaging in illegal liquor traffic and that it employs " hostesses , " often minors , as " drink hustlers . " These places escape the safeguards of the old excise law , the State labor law and the regulations of the Health Department , and conditions in many of them are notoriously bad . By comparison the public cabaret and the after-theatre supper clubs are held " virtually innocuous . " The " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " honeycombed with private stalls , " screened from the public , is a breeder of vice . So is the public dance hall , about which the committee has much to say . It is discouraging to learn that in spite of the efforts of some decent proprietors the bad halls are in the " overwhelming majority . " The committee commends Commissioner WIIALEN for his efforts to suppress commercialized vice . Of 360 speakeasy clubs found in 1928 to be identified with prostitution , 213 have been put out of business , mostly by the police . The commissioner has helped to stop the trade . So have the newspapers , by refusing hostess ads . The committee sees a hopeful sign in the establishment of the Crime Prevention Bureau . To that particular activity it will devote special attention in the years to come . It is peculiarly fitted by experience to do so , knowing as it does at first hand some of the conditions that breed crime . It enters the second quarter century of its work with the good-will of all who appreciate how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has already accomplished .
