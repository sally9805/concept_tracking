To most Orientals as to most Europeans a chrysanthemum is only a chrysanthemum . But there are two outstanding exceptions . In Japan , it has been the " Sacred Flower " for more than 1,000 years . No Japanese except royalty may use the full or 16-petal chrysanthemum device , but with fewer petals the chrysanthemum figures in countless Japanese designs , supposedly lucky . In Italy , however , to present a living man with a chrysanthemum is to wish him bad luck , for chrysanthemums are considered ideal flowers for graves . <P> Last week , short-sighted Japanese Emperor Hirohito , the not-too-alert Son of Heaven , sent to his Fascist ally Premier Benito Mussolini the highest decoration in the gift of His Imperial Majesty . Italian papers proudly reported that Il Duce had received the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Japanese Empire , did not mention that it consisted of a decoration in the form of a flower , that its proper name was the " Order of the Chrysanthemum.
