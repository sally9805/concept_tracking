txt Water When the floods come in New England could not that water be saved as a public utility and piped West to the farmers when they have droughts ? If this were done could the New England farmers charge the Western farmers for the water ? If so , there would be no further farmers ' expense to the administration , and therefore no farmers ' tax on common citizens . We get good money from pipe lines for oil , why not from water ? At the rate we are going water will be worth more than oil out West very soon . We could get the pipes on bonds payable far ahead , and the New England farmers could let in only as much water as we deemed reasonable and right for the Western farmers to use without wasting it at their end. - ABIAL HIGGINSON , Boston .
