FAREWELL Miss JULIE LOGAN-J . M. Barrie-Scribner ( $1 ) . Not many authors and fewer poets know when to retire . Notable exception is Alfred Edward Housman who , at the age of 63 , published his Last Poems and has stuck by his announcement . Sir James Matthew Barrie has certainly done his bit for the world of letters ; readers , without actually thinking him dead , may well have thought him finished . But now , after nearly 30 years ( in which he has written 14 plays but no stories ) comes a little Scottish fairy tale as neat as a pin , bright as a button , sentimental as Tommy . Barrie lovers will hail it ; it should send readers who do not know him scuttling back to his early works . Adam Yestreen , who tells the tale , is pastor of a little hamlet among the hills , still visited ( say some ) by ghosts of Prince Charlie 's men-aye , and women too . Pastor Yestreen , though a simple soul , takes no stock in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' They make a complete sentence by saying of a friend , ' He is one who on a market day , ' and leaving the rest to the listener 's common sense . " When winter sets in in earnest , the manse is isolated from the rest of the village : sometimes the pastor has to preach at his flock from across the brook . He is lonely , but his one neighbor , old Mrs. Lindinnock , always waves goodnight to him by pulling her windowshade up &; down . When one fine night a young and beautiful stranger appears with old Mrs. Lindinnock at a sociable , and even calls on him at the manse , Pastor Yestreen 's simple soul is nearly swept from its moorings . Miss Julie Logan is a flirtatious chit , but her heart is kind . Parson Yestreen comes as near as nothing to marrying her outright . The fairy story has a sighing end , as a proper Barrie fairy story should .                @ @ @ @ @
