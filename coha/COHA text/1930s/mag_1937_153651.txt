Hawaii and Puerto Rico , although voteless , have long contended that they are entitled to equal consideration with Louisiana , Michigan , Colorado or any other State . Delegates from Honolulu are forever pointing out that Hawaii pays more income tax than any of 16 States . But last week U. S. citizens in those islands feared that the House of Representatives regarded them as mere colonies . Whereas New York or Georgia might refine all the sugar they could get their hands on , the House restricted Hawaiian refiners to 3% , Puerto Rico refiners to 16% of their own sugar which they produce for consumption on the mainland . This action Congressman Maury Maverick compared to declaring that " cotton grown in North Carolina could n't be made into towels there . " <P> The House had plenty of help in making up its mind . For seven months the most active lobby since the 1930 Smoot-Hawley tariff bill had buzzed about Capitol corridors . Chief Lobbyist Ellsworth Bunker , vice president &; treasurer of the National Sugar Refining Co. of New Jersey , gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Economist-Lobbyist John E. Dalton , ex-chief of sugar for AAA , wrote carefully prepared treatises and reference books demonstrating the need for protecting U. S. refiners and refinery workers ( of whom there are only 16,000 ) . Ex-Senator-Lobbyist Hubert D. Stephens of Mississippi and ex-Congressman-Lobbyist Loring Black of New York , both respected by their ex-colleagues , shouldered the contact work . A dozen lawyer-lobbyists and refiner-lobbyists , headed by General Counsel H. Beach Carpenter , stood ready at all times to see that the Congress did not lack for convincing information . Why , demanded the lobbyists , enlarge an industry off-shore when the same industry was at 62% capacity on the continent ? <P> In their lengthy battle the sugar refining lobbyists ran up against opposition as tough as Washington could provide : the Roosevelt Administration . Secretary of State Hull objected to the 1937 Sugar Bill because : 1 ) it cut down Good Neighbor Cuba 's raw sugar quota by 6% and Cuba 's refined sugar quota by one-fifth-something to make other Good Neighbors suspicious of Mr. Hull 's advances ; 2 ) the Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of the Interior Ickes ranted about lobbyists who would discriminate against his islands : " A form of protection not even suggested . . . in the days of Smoot and Grundy.
