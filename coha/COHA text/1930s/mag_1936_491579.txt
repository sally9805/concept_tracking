yOU hear on all sides these days that the million-dollar gate at the Baer-Louis fight is a sure sign the depression is over . I would n't know about that . I 've seen too many depressions to get brash about them . But I do know that that much money being paid in at the turnstiles for any boxing match would have been impossible without the contributions of two men of my generation . One was , the Marquis of Queensberry , father of the rules which took the undue brutality out of boxing . The other was Gentleman Jim Corbett , the pugilist who brought boxing out of the alley and into the royal suite . I was Corbett 's manager before and during his greatest glory , so I know something about how he did it . Fighters had been plenty popular before he arrived . Nobody was ever idolized the way the sporting public . particularly the Irish . idolized John L. Sullivan . But Corbett 's urbanity and lithe grace in the ring could appeal to a public for whom boxers had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a woman insisted on smuggling herself into the Corbett-Sullivan fight . in men 's clothes , when the heavyweight ? champion could sit down on equal terms with any financier or senator in the land , then there was some chance of repealing the various state laws which banned boxing along with drug peddling and horse stealing . Corbett , the new kind of fighter , came along just in time to finish the clean-up job which the Queensberry rules began . Jim and I were old acquaintances long before either of us had proved much . When we first met . I was the cocky , dandy peanut butcher on a crack train from San Francisco to Santa Cruz  --  the local Coney Island  --  cleaning up lots of money and courting a girl at the other end of the line . She had a sister almost as pretty as she was . And Pompadour Jim Corbett , the young bank it teller who was already king of local amateur boxing and the best-dressed youth in town , was courting the sister , who later became the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could ever resist the temptation to turn round and take another look at his long . straight back and the easy swing of his shoulders : if he 'd picked my girl , I 'd have been out of luck . But as it was , we got along fine , and every week end when he ran down to Santa Cruz on the train , I spent all the time I could spare from business chatting with him . His boxing at the Olympic Club  --  Frisco 's topnotch athletic organization  --  was only recreation , the kind of recreation a brisk young husky would naturally take to . No up from the gutter in his ease : pa was reasonably well off . being the best-thought-of undertaker in the respectable Irish eommtmity of Hayes Valley . Jim would have made his mark  --  and a big mark , too  --  if he 'd stayed in banking . That smart , clean , likable kind go a long way in whatever they do . But he had a natural aptitude for fighting , the finest physique the Almighty ever put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watson , the Olympic Club instructor  --  a combination that was always edging him nearer the professional ring . While I was barnstorming as a youthful actor . Corbett 's fighting fame was beginning to leak out of San Francisco into the sporting world at large . It made talk when he outpointed Jack Burke , the English middleweight champion , in an exhibition . There was a lot more talk about his three fights with Joe Choynski , the other great local heavyweight . Corbett told me once that his last bout with Choynski. thirty-odd rounds with only riding gloves  --  wickeder than bare fists in some ways  --  was the toughest he 'd ever been through . John L. 's Achilles ' Heel A ND when the great John L. came to town on one of his meet-all-corners tours , Corbett , turned pro in the meantime by becoming the Olympic instructor , was his logical opponent .. Sullivan would consent to only a three-round exhibition in full evening dress . at a charity benefit , attended by all the best people , men and women  --  Corbett was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to genteel applause . But it had a lot to do with Corbett 's becoming champion just the same . It taught him that Sullivan . the king of pugilism , the legendary man-killer , could be hit at will and kept away from at will . The way John L. would bite at a feint impressed . Jim , and he remembered it with murderous effect years later at New Orleans . All Sullivan or most of the old-timers knew was a straight left and a right-handed haymaker . Corbett was pioneering with fast footwork , uppercuts , hooks  --  the arsenal of the modern boxer . I 've seen them all since Sullivan , big and little , and Jim Corbett was the finest spa.rrer who ever stepped into a ring . Then Choynski 's friends , smarting under their man 's series of defeats at Corbett 's hands , imported Peter Jackson , the great Australian against whom Sullivan had drawn the color line , to whip Corbett . A good idea that did n't work . After thirty rounds of slashing fighting , neither man would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referee called it no contest , they waltzed around each other . Corbett saying to Jackson : " Come on , you ! You 're the famous fighter ! Come on in and finish me off ! " Overnight the papers all over the country were blazing with the name of the recent amateur who had stayed sixty rounds with Peter Jackson . At the moment I was just starting my sixteen-year fight with Augustin Daly over the rights to After Dark . Pending appeal on the case , I was touring the play over the old Bowery melodrama circuit . Business was good . but I wanted standing room only  --  and these sudden headlines in the papers gave me ideas . The printer 's ink was hardly dry when I was telegraphing Jim to come East and spar in the concert-hall scene in After Dark . Primrose and West , the minstrel kings , far bigger frogs than I in the theatrical puddle , had the same idea . But memories of summer evenings and nice girls in Santa Cruz must have won . I got the call . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never headed while it stayed together . The movies did n't invent the idea of exploiting boxers as actors . That 's an old gag , which had much more excuse fifty years ago . There was no boxing then outside of private clubs or bootlegged bouts on barges , with the sheriff 's posse likely to turn up any minute . The ordinary citizen had to be content with fourth-rate sparring exhibitions in cheap variety theaters , and , by the same token , even the best-known fighters could make very little money out of straight fighting . Out of that situation arose the custom of taking the top-notch heavyweights  --  the only fighters whose names were well enough known  --  on exhibition tours or theatrical tours , starring them in specially constructed plays . Sock and Buskin S ULLIVAN. for instance , went over big in a play entitled Honest Hearts and Willing Hands  --  which should give you a rough idea of what it was like . Peter Jackson , who , black or not , was a fine and intelligent fellow , played Uncle Torn as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the blacksmith from down under , exploited winning the championship in an affair called The Honest Blacksmith , which introduced a real forge on the stage and enabled Fitz to delight his audiences by making real . horseshoes before their very eyes . If he took a shine to you , he 'd make a horseshoe specially for you with your name written in the hot . iron . Acting ability cut little ice in these cases , of course . Plenty of people were going to pay money to see the champion , whether or not he could not a lick . But that made it pretty sweet for / Corbett , who could act and fight both . That was what made the pair of us such a natural . I wanted a heavyweight champion for a theatrical attraction . If , in order to get one , I had to make a champion out of a rising youngster , well and good . There was no more need for apologizing for Corbett as an actor than as an after-dinner speaker . In both jobs he was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd already glade a big hit as an amateur in San Francisco , playing Armand Duval in Camille . When he made his first Broadway stage appearance  --  singing Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay in a very pleasant baritone  --  he was as smooth as any old trouper horn in a prop box . After losing the championship , he made a good living off the stage for ten or fifteen years , coming a cropper only once , when he flew too high and tried playing the boxer hero of Shaw 's The Admirable Bashville . So it made a great deal of sense that , shortly after installing him as the crucial attraction of After Dark , I ordered a play written for him . And , as build-up for the play , I started after getting him a fight with Sullivan . That 's probably the world 's record for queer reasons for turning big-time fight . manager . But it would have sounded even queerer at the time , because the idea of toppling Sullivan from his throne was inconceivable to anybody in his senses . John L. was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Babe Ruth , with a dash of Paul Bunyan mixed in . But I suspected Sullivan had long been coasting on his reputation  --  he had n't fought in six years  --  and I knew in Corbett I had a fighter who compared with Sullivan as the first rifle compared with a smoothbore musket . We were n't the only people looking for a match with the Boston Strong Boy . Everybody was barking on his trail  --  all the sporting editors and the whole crew of fighters . Charley Mitchell , the game Englishman , and a pack of formidable Australians  --  Frank Slavin , Bob Fitzsimmons , Peter Jackson  --  were challenging , instating. badgering , riding John L. in an effort to get him into the ring . Sullivan stood it as long as he could . Then he turned at bay and roared back , issuing a long royal proclamation which paid personal compliments to each of his tormentors by name , referred to James J. Corbett . as " that bombastic bluffer , " and announced . that the first man who could put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good faith and the balance in six months , could be knocked loose from his teeth by John L. Sullivan any time he liked . Within ten minutes of reading that , I 'd counted up  --  just a little more than $2500 in the war chest . " Jim , " I said , " here 's our chance . " At nine o'clock the next morning , while the other fellows were still thinking about it , I was down laying $2500 in nice new bills on the desk of the stakeholder  --  Joe Eakins , the sporting editor of the old New York World . A lot of people thought Slavin stood a better chance of licking Sullivan than Corbett and said so out loud . I think myself , Slavin , a tough customer from away back , could have managed it easily . In fact , I suspect it was a similar notion in Sullivan 's head which made him stick to the Corbett match , no matter how Slavin 's supporters hollered . Travelers in Leather I WAS N'T worried about raising the balance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sullivan challenge as capital , that . was a pipe . We took the obvious method  --  a pugilistic barnstorming tour . That kind of tour is still the shadiest end of the fight game . In big places , where the sporting editors were hep to a good deal , we gave straight . exhibitions between Corbett and a sparring partner . In smaller places , where boxing was practically extinct , we pulled the old gag of " will meet . all comers , " offering $100 to any local boy who could stay with Corbett for four rounds . They tell me that the only funny business Sullivan pulled on such tours was paying a local pug twenty-five dollars to appear and take a dive  --  meaning let himself be knocked out  --  when nobody else dared climb into the ring . But Corbett was no such undatuageable ox as Sullivan and , although he could hit plenty hard , quick killings were n't his style . If my man cracked up his hands on some concrete-jawed blacksmith in St. Joe , or too many people stayed four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot . So I arranged matters to prevent accidents . The answer consisted of a " mixed-ale fighter " named Connie McVey  --  a mixed-ale fighter being a run-of-mine pugilist , supposed to train on mixed ale and willing to pick up money any old way . 111eVey looked like several million dollars in the ring and had a good head on him  --  just what we needed to stooge for Corbett , . This was another boxer who could act . His performance of giving and taking tremendous punishment , only to be dropped by a punishing punch just before the end of the last . round , was a triumph of the histrionic art , getting his glove between his own jaw and Corbett 's fist in a Way that made the finishing punch sound like a pile driver coming home on a concrete hitching block  --  and , incidentally , made sure Corbett 's hand would be uninjured . His peculiar genius , however , lay in the diplomatic department  --  which consisted in traveling well ahead of us , arriving in a promising spot and writing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting to know when Corbett would arrive , because he 'd like a crack at that $100 . By the time we got there , McVey would be the idol of the local sporting element , and business would be correspondingly good . Our first town was Hartford . When we got off the train , the first thing we saw was McVey , known locally as Knockout Miller , I think it was , riding down the main street with the mayor and receiving the plaudits of art admiring crowd . Ile took to a series of aliases like a confidence man . We met hint in Washington State as The Walla Walla Giant . in Butte City as The NIontuna ( ' rusher , in El Paso as The Texas Terror , and any number of places under the chaste label of The Man-killer , which always gut over fine where other inspiration was lacking . Still , it took even him two or three weeks to worm his way into the affections of a new town and , to make our stake , we had to show two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do well in small places , t hat forced us to take an uncomfortable number of flyers into meeting local contenders . Sometimes they 'd take twenty-five dollars to play possum , sometimes they were in dead earnest , which was risky . But we looked out for the earnest ones by working on their nerves before the fight . That assignment went to Corbett and his sparring partner . a rugged second-rater named Jim Daly . Daly lived fighting so thoroughly that , whatever he started to do  --  whether shake hands , or say it was a nice day , or order a drink  --  he always led off with a boxing attitude as naturally as a Nazi says " I lei , Hitler . " Daly , t ' orbett and the local pug would all be in t he dressing room together before the fight . and Dady 's and ( ' orbett 's conversation would run something like this : " Say . Jim . ever get any more word about that fellow in Chillicothe ? " " He 's all right . " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms . " He 'll be out of bed in a couple of months anyway . Bill wants to send something to his family. - " They finally brought him to , did they ? " " After while . " says Corbett . " He was out for three hours , and I guess his jaw 's gone for good , but I feel better now I know I did n't kill him . " " Gosh , Jim . " says Daly , " you just .1unno your own strength . Better be .. : Ireful with this one . " I 'd rehearsed them as letter-perfect and natural as an old shoe . After ten minutes of that. , you 'd fair have to carry the local boy into the ring . And once he was there , Corbett had only to fool round as long as he liked , then pull his man off balance with a feint  --  how that man could feint ! ? and put him away with one punch . .8 Hard Nut to Crack Not that we always got away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . named Monahan. made out of east-iron and sole leather . who specialized on lasting four rounds with champions and would n't scare . There used to be a story that we got rid of him by hacking him up against the backdrop . where Daly was hiding with a carpenTer 's maul in his hand . Au Apache Indian in Tucson . the only competition available . started a race riot on us in an audience composed of half white men and half Indians when he pulled a knife on Corbett in the ring . We always looked round on entering a theater to pick a hidden door or handy window which would permit of a hasty exit . The usefulness of such knowledge is evident : it was indispensable ? in San Bernardino . That story really begins back in my peannt-butchering days  --  the same days when the three Karp hrothers were the quick-triggered terrors of Arizona . My train pulled into Benson . the junction point for Tombstone , one clay at just the moment when the Earps were making a getaway . You 've probably heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us tough an hombre . The third brother had been killed from ambush. but Wyatt and Virgil made the train and put their brother 's body in the baggage ear . Tombstone telegraphed to Tucson to take the Earps off when the train got there . But the first we knew of who our passengers were was when we saw the Tucson station black with people and bristling with guns . The Earps had already taken measures about it .. Wyatt was up in the tender , gun in hand , persuading the engineer to go right on through without stopping . Virgil was hanging out of a vestibule door . also gun in hand , bombarding the platform as we went by to make sure nobody got aboard . When Corbett Ran Away That gave me a good look at . Virgil  --  and a fine thing I had it . When Corbett and I hit San Bernardino , California , years later , the whole town insisted on our meeting a local Negro boxer who had once stood up to Sullivan for four rounds  --  one of several times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That did n't suit our book . ' We were near the cud of our tour with no mishaps. and there was no point in risking Corbett 's hands and reputation with another Monahan in a place that small . So we put on our regular sparring act to poor business  --  the local sports were sore  --  arid called it a day . Back at the hotel we were waited on by a committee of citizens guaranteeing a $300 house if only Corbett would take on the Negro . We still said no . But for that $300 we 'd let Daly stand up with him , if they were so anxious to see him tight . I posted myself on the door to discourage deadheads while Daly . Corbett and the Negro went to the dressing rooms . When Daly and Corbett tried to work on his nerve ; the Negro sassed back . About the third crack out of Corbett about somebody Daly had maimed for life , " Hush your big mouth . " says the Negro . " Come on out on that stage and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew of the trouble , here came the Negro running out on the stage  --  there was n't enough light to make things very clear  --  with ( ' or-belt after him . I started for the stage . But just as I reached the orchestra pit , I heard a cold , hard , rasping voice from somewhere back of me  --  the kind of voice a rattlesnake would have if it could talk : " Corbett , " it said . " lay a hand on that man and I 'm telling you now , you 'll never live to light Sullivan . " I swung round . There behind me , with a hand in each coat pocket . ready for business . was Virgil Karp . I 'd seen him only once in ten years . but you could n't miss that face , not even in that bad light . I knew his fingers were on the triggers . I did n't wait to wonder how he got in . I rushed up to him . threw my arms round hint as if he 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and started talking . Virgil , who was n't as good a press agent for himself as his brother and never reached the same fame , was sufficiently Uttered at being recognized to let me get away with it . I do n't know what cajoling nonsense I filled hint with , all the while using my head and elbows to give Corbett the office to get out of there while he was still able to run . As soon as Corbett , getting the idea , broke away and sprinted for the door , hurdling the orchestra pit as he went , the Negro dived for a backstage window , tore out a sashweight and started after him , looking for nothing short of murder . I abandoned Earp and dived for the Negro . Once again my flow of hysterical language worked  --  at least , slowed hint up till I heard the door smash shut behind Corbett . Then I linked it after him . Jim had a good start on me , but I made the hotel only ten yards behind him . We never saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price . If Earp had ever pulled those guns , the world would have been out a heavyweight champion . You can see why we preferred fighting set-ups . McVey 's act went bad on us once , too , when he appeared in El Paso as The Texas Terror . He had outdone himself , getting in with the local sports , particularly with one old coot who set up to be the sporting authority for that whole end of Texas . A familiar type in the West forty years ago  --  he 'd seen all the prize fights and horse races , had made his pile in gold or silver , owned an old gun with notches on the butt and a taller lie to match each notch  --  just made to fit the old line about " Shake the hand that shook the hand of John L. Sullivan . " Ile must have been hearing stories about us . Anyway , he started announcing early and often that , when his pal , The Texas Terror , met Corbett . he was going to sit right behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny business . He did n't suspect McVey , but he did suspect us . Too Good to be ' True It was it trifle embarrassing . But we figured that , between Corbett 's brilliance in the ring and McVey 's flawless acting , we could pull the wool over the eyes of any small-town sport . And I must say that , when the great night arrived , I never saw the boys put on a better show  --  it was a sweet act by that time . Corbett weaving and sidestepping , rocking McVey with deadly looking punches : McVey boring back in with rights and lefts that . kept the crowd up on their hind legs ; and then McVey 's mad rush at the end of the fourth , with Corbett dropping him as per schedule with a crack on the jaw you could have heard in Juarez across the river . The crowd went mad over it . But it was n't good enough for old Eagle-eye . I do n't know what tipped him off , but I saw what he did about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammonia and a big sponge . soaked one with the other and , before we could stop him , skipped into the ring and slammed that sponge , reeking with ammonia , on . McVey 's mouth and nose . The effect was tremendous . Theoretically , McVey was out so cold you could n't have brought him to with 86 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST February 8 , 1936 ! ( Continued from Page 84 ) a red-hot poker . But the ammonia fetched him on his feet in a split second . choking , gasping and weeping . " Faker ! Faker ! " yells the old sport , dancing round like he was on fire . " You ca n't get away with that in my town ! " The crowd gasped , then roared . They were a good-natured lot or . the West being what it was then , we might well have left town on a rail apiece . As it was , the occasion turned into an ovation for the old gent , while we were wafted out of the theater on a gale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training quarters in Loch Arbour , New . Jersey , right across the lake from Asbury Park , readying for the fight finally scheduled for early September in New Orleans  --  where the Louisiana legislature had just obligingly legalized prize fighting in order to get a heavy-spending crowd into New Orleans . the first important break in the dam of legislative restrictions . Asbury Park , a very stiff community under the supervision of Founder . James A. Bradley . as outraged by our presence so near hand , and Bradley worked himself into fever trying to get us ousted . But Corbett turned loose his charm on the old fellow , and inside a week he was ' me of the most ardent admirers of this distinguished , well-spoken gentleman who was n't at all what a heavyweight pug should be like . Why , when Corbett drove to the station , starting for New Orleans , Bradley sat beside him on the seat of the tallyho coach . and the municipal council of Asbury Park made up the rest of the load . It was as astounding a spectacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a convention of bartenders . The tour had netted us our $7500 , but training expenses ate into it badly and , as the date of final payment drew near . we had to raise some backing . I tackled Phil Dwyer . an eminent sporting figure , owner of the old Brooklyn race track , who was one of the few who thought Corbett had a chance . Even he was dubious , particularly after he came down and looked Corbett over and found him still way below weight  --  around 165 pounds . The tour had peeled it off him and we had n't had time to put it hack . Again I had to arrange matters . Dwyer went away to think it over . When he returned some days later , I reported that Corbett had been building up fast , and put him on a scale to prove it , just in his shirt and pants . I did n't tell Dwyer I 'd inserted a ten-pound weight in his pants pocket .. The scale read round 175 , with allowance for clothes , " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill . But if he 's coming along that . way , take care of you . How much do you want ? " Why We Had to Whip Sullivan And then , so help me , when we all got into the earriage to drive Dwyer hack to the station , the weight fell out of Corbett 's pocket in plain sight .. But hit a piece of turf , so it did n't make my noise . And before Dwyer could spot it , I 'd dropped my hat over it and then picked it up along with the hat . I just could n't see a matter of ten measly pounds come between us and the clean-up that would follow the Sullivan fight . Naturally , I was not forgetting that the clean-up would come not from the fight but from the play . which was called Gentleman Jack . written by a competent hack dramatist named Charles 1 ' . Vincent . Fur relaxation during the tour and the training period , I rehearsed Corbett in it till he was fine . Gentleman Jack was a masterpiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mch . The main point to it was that , with my instructions , Vincent had built . it to emphasize Corbett 's distinctive angle , the novelty of a gentleman fighter which we were going to plug to a fare-yewell . The hero was a college boxing champion  --  the educated touch , you see  --  in love with a pretty girl and going into the professional ring in order to pay off t he mortgage on her old man 's farm or something . The last act was a thrilling depiction of the big fight for the championship . with a. ringside crowd of supers going mad with excitement . Naturally , the hero won . That meant that , if Gentleman Jack was n't going to make fools of us , we had to whip Sullivan . Bluffing the Boston Strong Boy As I rehearsed the role of Gentleman Jack 's father-in-law opposite Corbett , day after day , anti saw him rounding into beautiful shape , for both fighting and acting , the whole thing looked perfectly practical . I suppose I had no business entering on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I was no stranger to sports in general or showmanship either , and showmanship is'half of handling a fighter . The other half , the technical side , was in the highly expert hands of Billy Delaney , Corbett 's loyal trainer . The goose hung high those days in the barn where we trained . And we trained for business . On the way South we traveled with a freight ear fixed up as a gymnasium. and we even stopped off for twenty-four hours in Charlotte , North Carolina , to give Corbett some real road work to keep his legs from stiffening up . The psychology we used on Sullivan before the fight was n't exactly deep stuff , but it worked . What with one device and another , we had the Boston Strong Boy licked before he stepped into the ring . I 'd had Broadway and the main railway lines to New Orleans sown with screeching lithograph stands announcing in letters a foot high that James J. Corbett . champion of the world , would appear in exhibitions in each town along the return route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shortly after the fight . They adorned every barn , fence and chicken house all the way ; unless Sullivan traveled in a blindfold , he 'd see nothing else for two days just before defending his title . When he got to New Orleans , the place was stiff with lithographs announcing that James J. Corbett , champion of the world , would appear immediately after the fight in a special performance of After Dark , in New Orleans . For that grand occasion I appeared in the role of Old Tom , my old barnstorming specialty . And we did n't let it go at that . We kept right on persecuting him clear into the tight itself . Sullivan was even more superstitious than most fighters , and , luckily , the Olympic A. C. , where the fight was to be . had a special superstition of its own  --  a notion that every boxer who used a certain corner of the ring came out winner . When Charlie Johnson , Sullivan 's backer , came to me on the night of the fight to toss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sullivan 's presence , to prevent squawks . He and I went to Sullivan 's dressing room . The old man-killer was lying on a couch looking grim . saying nothing just glared at me and grunted . Being an actor comes in handy lots of places . Whatever I was feeling , I looked him in the eye and grinned as cocky as you please . Johnson tossed . I called heads and heads it was . " Which corner do you take ? " he asked . " Which corner ? " I shouted , suddenly raucous and exultant . " Which corner do I take ? " I crossed over and shouted in Sullivan 's face : " The same corner you 'd take , Johnson  --  the lucky corner ! " Then I turned , apparently mad with joy , and tore out of the room , shouting at the top of my lungs : " We 've got the lucky corner ! We 've got the lucky corner ! " We also exploited the standard superstition that the first man to enter the ring is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a firm believer in this notion , always tried to jockey his opponent into entering before him and then appearing himself for a soul-stirring ovation that would impress the other fellow . We knew that and conned our course accordingly . At fight time we stalled and stalled until we got word that Sullivan was in the ring . But when we got into the aisle leading to the ring , almost choked with a crowd waiting for us , I saw that it had been a dodge to trick us  --  Sullivan was coming along behind . " Wait , Jim , " I said , and pushed my man into the crowd , leaving a clear space for Sullivan , to whom I turned . " You 're the champion , " I said . " After you . " With all those people around , he could n't delay . Scowling and snorting , he preceded us . And as I neared the ring , I took care to shout to everybody in sight , good and loud , so Sullivan would hear : " The first to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First in , last out ! " Before the Battle I needed to reassure myself by acting as cocky as the traffic would bear . The atmosphere of New Orleans before the fight was anything but reassuring . If Corbett really could take Sullivan , nine-tenths of the sporting men in the country were crazy . That crowd had no more doubt of Sullivan 's impregnability than of the sun 's rising the next morning . No champion since has had such a reputation , not even Dempsey , who was the finest natural fighter I ever saw . There were plenty of times when I started wondering if we had n't bitten off more than we could chew . Corbett had no doubts . When I was talking to him on the afternoon of the fight , he just laughed at my long face . " Bill , " he said , " I can lick him without mussing my hair . " lie was thinking back to the evening in San Francisco when he 'd stepped round Sullivan the way a weasel would step round a woodchuck . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely that Sullivan pulling punches in an exhibition before ladies was n't the same Sullivan we were up against , goaded into fury by well-calculated persecution and savagely bent on teaching a lesson to this upstart dude , as everybody thought Corbett was . On leaving Corbett that afternoon , I wandered into the lobby of the St. ( ' harles Hotel , headquarters of the fight crowd , and ran into my worst moment . The lobby was full of men and talk and smoke and money  --  wads of money offered on Sullivan at 4 to I , with no takers to mention . Only freak spite of himself . When the referee Sullivan had n't laid a glove on him , but the wearing-down process had n't gone . very far yet , and one of those crushing side-winders of the old master 's could still ruin everything . I was frantic , for everything meant not only the championship hut Gentleman Jack as well . The most urgent thing I could think of to say was : " Jim . . Jim , you 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake , remember Gentleman Jack and do what Delaney tells you . " But Corbett , who had his share of fighting blood , was beyond worrying about Gentleman Jack . After the fourth he waltzed in. coolly , cannily , scientifically cutting Sullivan to ribbons , readying him for the kill and yet taking no chances either . It was a beautiful exhibition . As for Sullivan , how he ever stayed for the twenty-one rounds it lasted , I 'll never tell you . It just was n't in him to quit , that 's all . I was so nervous through it all that , after the fight , I found I 'd eaten most of the palm-leaf fan I had in my band . The Passing of a Legend The picture at the inevitable end was both triumphant and tragic . There stood Corbett , not a hair mussed , as he had promised , not a mark on him  --  nobody ever put a mark on Jim ( ' orbett . At the end of his career , his Roman beak was just as shapely as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the blood-soaked sand , symbolizing for the dumfounded crowd the passing of the whole old-time tradition of fighters . Licked though he was , he was still the gamest of the game . ' When they got him to his feet . he staggered to the ropes , lifted one huge paw and trumpeted : " The pitcher went to the well once too often ! I was licked by a better man ! But thank God he 's an American ! " You can imagine  --  I hope you can , because I ca n't describe it  --  how it feels to call your shot on winning the world 's heavyweight championship . But even in our delirium we did n't forget business . The fight had already crowded the presidential campaign off the front pages . Now we cracked them wide open again , planting Corbett in the public mind once and for all as a gentleman pugilist , by his actions after the victory . Traditionally , the winner should have gone on a colossal spree , painting the town red in weeks of open-handed carousal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Y. : NI . C. A. where he had worked out during our stay in New Orleans before the fight , drank a large glass of pure . innocent , milk and retired decorously to rest . That fetched ' em like Calvin Coolidge 's " / do not choose to run . " On the winner-take-all basis , we got $25.000 out of the fight . But that was chicken feed when we began cleaning up in the wake of the lithographs which had so annoyed Sullivan . Fifteen thousand people met us at the station in New York . after we 'd toured our way North , and Madison Square Garden was jammed that night to see Corbett box a few rounds with a sparring partner . When we gave a benefit for Sullivan , ( ' orbett and he sparring with sofa-cushion gloves , the new champion 's prestige plus the old champion 's popularity made $20.000 to hand over to John L. A real champion is always more popular in defeat  --  almost as many of them flocked to the station to meet Sullivan as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everywhere we took itand we took it just as far as it would go  --  you could n't have squeezed in another paying customer with a shoehorn . I wo n't say they were mostly women , but it seemed that way . The female of the species made more fuss over Corbett than over any matinee idol in the business . They made themselves nuisances , but we took and liked it ; it was good for business . I remember coming into ( ' orbett 's room in Toledo one afternoon and finding a stranger with him manipulating some plaster of Paris . He 'd made a cast . of Corbett 's hand , and was cleaning up preparatory to departing . " What 's all this , Jim ? " I asked . " Crazy idea , " says Corbett . " This fellow thinks he can sell paperweights made out of a cast of my hand . " In one step I crossed the room and smashed the cast on the floor . " Crazy or not , " I said , " it 'll cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did cost him just that and , on a rough estimate , he must have made twenty thousand out of the deal . Everywhere you went for the next year , you saw that paperweight cast from the hand that had finally cut the great John L. down from his throne . We lived high on our immense profits , elegantly as well as lavishly . That was Corbett 's natural instinct ; it was n't put on . Sullivan 's idea of a grand gesture had been to march into a barroom under the El , throw a pocketful of silver on the bar  --  his pockets were always bulging with silver  --  and call for drinks for the house . ( ' orbett 's style was to enter a crystal-lighted dining room and open wine for the company at some ten times the expense . His hotel bills averaged a thousand a week . Money went out in bucketfuls , but it came in in tankfuls , so it did n't matter . And he was n't blowing it . all in , easy curve . easy go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chunk of Bronx real estate and sold for a neat profit a little later . People sensed good taste about him . It was easy as rolling off a log to sell him as " Gentleman Jim . " the new title , deriving from the name of the play . which stuck with him the rest . of his life . When he 'd come into Delmonico 's and sit down at a big table alone , it would n't he ten minutes before it was standing room only at his table , with his ready wit and instinctive courtesy as attractions a would have worked whether he ? i ; champion or not . Not that we scooted the barrooms either . Part of our act on striking a new town with Gentleman Jack was to visit the local hangout of the sporting element , buy a couple of rounds for the boys and talk shop . But Delmonico 's was where we belonged . There was only one had omen . We did n't know yet that it was a bad omen . As soon as Corbett . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a pair of grotesquely broad shoulders and a flaming red head appeared in the transom over the door . and a harsh voice called in : " 1 say .. Jint ! I can lick you and I want first chance ! " Corbett looked up and scowled . " Beat it . you freak ! " he yelled hack . He had no use whatever for this spindle-shanked , freckle-faced Bob Fitzsimmons.
