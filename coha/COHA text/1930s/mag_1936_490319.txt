MERRIEST of all the corn-belt states is Iowa , where dwells the Tingley Telephone Company . Call us up some rainy afternoon ! WHEN the lights went out the other night , it even affected milk delivery the next morning . The cows gave down all right , but pasteurization went completely to pieces . NE thing we enjoy about the ski k- , rage is the weather bulletins imag papers . Whatever the state of our own athletic intentions or abilities , there is nothing more salutary in the early morning than to read that the trails are fast in Pinkham Notch , and it 's snowing hard in Stowe . MANY congratulations to the railroads of America for their perfect record of not one life lost last year ! We urge the roads to continue to regard present speeds as plenty high enough for all practical purposes , and to bend their efforts toward making travel a good in itself , not just a means to an end . We have two railroads which we especially love this week . One is the New York Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Each uncancelled number on the margin of this Ticket will entitle the bearer and any number of other persons to One Continuous Passage in either direction between New York and Bronxville . " Oh , for the time and strength to put this to the test ! Readers , we invite you , one and all , to ride to Bronxville with us , any day you can all agree on . Bring lunch . Our other favorite of the week is the Bermuda Railway , on whose official timetable is graved the fancy-free and thoroughly British legend , " Whilst every endeavour will be made to keep time , the Company is not hound in any way by the above table . " WE were on our way up to the Gardens of the Nations to attend a private preview of the new sixtyfive-petalled nasturtium which has been registered in the U. S. Patent Office by David Burpee . At the elevator , a change of heart came upon us , half revelation , half nostalgic yearning for the old-fashioned five-petalled nasturtium by the fence near the chicken yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything else in the world , " we cried , " you people are running nasturtiums into the ground ! " And we bolted through the door , a mad light in our eye . " plant-patent business is taking right hold , apparently . We know a man who received a birthday present of a nice little azalea . Tied around the azalea 's stem , like a chastity belt , was a metal tag from Bobhink &; Atkins , read-ing , " Asexual reproduction of this plant is illegal under the Plant Patent Act . " It was Number 147 . Our friend , a man of loose personal habits , ripped the tag off angrily , fed it to his dachs-hund puppy , and sent the plant to a friend in Connecticut with instructions to bed it down warmly next to an old buck hydrangea .

Not all of these people , luckily , are as bogged down as they at first appear . Often , after you 've known a person a long time , you suddenly find out that he has a secret life , into which he tucks little amorphous lumps of civilization , as into a bottom drawer . We know one gentleman , for example , who is regarded as distinguished in his field but who is patently not much interested in his work ; the thing that has absorbed him for years is an itching desire to get a good snapshot of a cock partridge in the act of drumming . During certain cold , pungent moments of waiting by a wall , he probably feels the waves of civilization enveloping him , comparable to the sensation Mr. Day felt , as intangible but as Life-givingas the vitamins in a bowl of wild rice .

It seems to us that rime used to enjoy a more shuffling gait in the days before the radio dialogues came to give America a bedtime thrill , using news as a basis . England and Italy , after the dramatic meeting in Shepheard 's Hotel the other night , courtesy of the March of Time 's giddap department , will certainly have to fight now , if only to justify the broadcasters ' art . Vice dislike news by theatrics . We resent being treated like an old man whose appetites are so dull he must have something mighty peppery , and full of phony menace , to make his gastric juices flow . Instructions AWELL-TRAVELLED lady of our acquaintance has just hurried back from Louisiana to tell us that in the window of the New Orleans Democratic headquarters is displayed a large picture of the late Huey Long .

Thank you . " Eternal Rehearsal WE dropped in at the Adelphi Theatre the other afternoon to see Max Reinhardt direct a rehearsal of " The Eternal Road , " his new Biblical super-spectacle . Statistically it will be the most imposing production of the season , leaving " Jumbo " a poor runner-up . Four hundred thousand dollars have been invested so far , most of it by wealthy Jewish people of the city . They are skittish about publicity , but we did learn that Maurice Levin , president of Hearns , A. A. Strelsin , an advertising man , and Eugene Meyer , the banker , are involved . The " Eternal Road " cast outnumbers " Jumbo , " and there seems to be some effort to beat " Jumbo 's " rehearsal record ; it 's in its second month now . As you probably have heard , the play is to he solemn and inspirational : Old Testament scenes , interpreted by a kind of Greek chorus of Jewish refugees from some unnamed modern persecution . As soon as we got inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell us that Herr Reinhardt was disturbed by our presence . We hid in the back of the house . Herr Reinhardt was rehearsing a scene between Ruth and Boaz , and Boaz was making a speech that began , " Nay , child ? " He could n't seem to get it loud enough . " NAYCH ill , " Herr Reinhardt would yell , and the actor would shout hack , wretchedly , " Nay , child , " and Herr Reinhardt , again , " NAYCH ild . " This went on and on , while the publicity woman who had us in tow pointed out notables lurking in the dark corners of the theatre : Norman Bel Geddes ( sets ) , Kurt Weill ( music ) , and the Baron F'ranzesko Mendelssohn , who takes down in a black leather notebook everything that Herr Reinhardt says during rehearsals , so that all the Master 's instructions will be remembered and carried out . Lots of seemingly irrelevant things began to happen on the stage . While Jacob Ben-Ami , who plays Saul , was being crowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a lot of other actors ran about , shouting and muttering . " They arc the persecuted congregation , " our guide explained . " There are two parallel plots , and it 's a little confusing now , because they are on the same stage . " It was , too . When " The Eternal Road " moves into the Manhattan Opera House , the stage will have been converted into a mountain , with two different levels for the different plots . The Opera House itself is to be converted into a synagogue , the way the Century Theatre was turned into a cathedral for " The Miracle . " We went around to the Opera House , where once , in our extreme youth , we had seen Florence Reed play the beautiful slave girl in " Chu-ChinChow , " and found Mr. Bel Geddes ' men knocking the very devil out of the old place . Before we could say " NAYCH ild , " we were stuffed with statistics : there will be 786,000 cubic feet of stage space ; the stage lighting will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yorker does in a week ; tickets for the opening night are going to be a hundred dollars apiece . ( It 's a benefit performance . ) The mountain on which the action takes place rests on the foundations of the THE NEW YORKER building , filling everybody with confidence . We climbed a fifty-seven-foot stairway to see the place where the angels are to stand . ( When the play opens , they are to have an elevator . ) The only thing Mr. Billy Rose will have left to boast about is his elephant . In knocking out walls , the workmen stumbled over a link with the past : a set of cigar- maker 's tools belonging to Os-car Hammerstein , who built the Opera House . He started life as a cigarmaker , and used to keep the kit around , out of sentiment , until it somehow got walled up behind a partition . ? ADitama-Lovttac friend of ours was wistfully browsing several weeks ago in the lobby of the Hollywood Theatre , looking at the display-of stills from " A Midsummer Night 's Dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thinks Max Reinhardt might like to have called to his attention . In a photograph of the throne-room scene several stalwart Negro lads appear as attendants . They are all meticulously dressed with the lavishness of old Athens , in huge turbans , satin trousers , and anklets  --  all , that is , except the one who is wearing white Oxford tennis shoes with vulcanized soles . The film has already been released to second-run movie houses all over the country , and there 's probably not much Herr Reinhardt can do about it now , but he might like to know . Gadget AGENTLEMAN who was in a department store the other day , making some modest purchases at the liquor counter , reported to us a rather surprising thing he noticed : the young lady who waited on him added up the items on the sales slip with a tiny gold adding machine which she carried inconspicuously in her hand . He fell to wondering if this was efficiency , or an effort to abash other stores , or what ; finally he asked us to investigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story as you 'd want to hear . It seems that the young lady of the adding machine comes of a once-wealthy family with New York and Philadelphia ? connections , and is rather new to work of the kind she 's now doing . She likes it , though , and gets along fine , except for one thing  --  she has to count on her fingers . ( She is bright in all other respects . ) Her little failing caused her all sorts of torture with the sales slips , until a thoughtful young man she knows presented her with the adding machine , a small but complicated affair which cleverly adds up the cost of bottles of Scotch and gin and vermouth . It has even given her a certain advantage over the other young ladies in the store , who do n't have to count on their fingers ; lots of people prefer to wait for her to attend to them , just to see the machine in action . in case you know a girl with a similar difficulty , we can tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen dollars . $56,500,000 THE Hell Gate plant of the United Electric Light &; Power Company , up in the Bronx at 132nd Street and the East River , is the most valuable piece of property in New York City , our real-estate reporter tells us , adding that he suspects it is the most valuable in the world . It 's assessed on the municipal rolls at $56,500,000 . This is the building that was in the news last week when ? something in it broke , or came unscrewed , and a biggish part of the city remained dark all evening . ( That was the same day , it so happened , that there appeared in the Herald Tribune an advertisement which exclaimed , " Imagine what would happen if some disaster destroyed one of our generating plants and we had no others ! " ) If you went up to the Bronx looking for $56,500,000 worth of grandeur , you 'd be disappointed . The plant occupies two solid blocks , but it 's only seven stories tall , built of utilitarian red brick . The assessment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the building 's contents ; it 's the contents that make the Hell Gate plant so valuable , and the land value . The Edison power plant in Brooklyn is bigger and can produce more power , but it 's only assessed at $55,000,000 , because it 's on less desirable land . The Edison plant on East Fourteenth Street is assessed at something under $33,000,000. just to give you something to compare these figures with , our real-estate man looked up the assessment of the Empire State Building ; that 's only $28,500,000 . The R.C.A. Building ( including the man on the flying trapeze ) is valued at two million dollars less than the Empire State . The Waldorf-Astoria tops all the other hotels with a listed value of $22,500,000 , and the Majestic Apartments majestically lead all the apartments with $7,650,000 . The most highly assessed office building in town is 120 Broadway : $29,000,000 . Well , that 's about enough figures . We just thought you might like to know about the Hell Gate plant and its $56,500,000 assessment . It 's kind of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Signs YOU may depend on it , every time somebody puts up a sign that does n't seem to mean just what it says , we hear about it . This week we have heard from a Mr. Keller about a notice on the truck entrance to B. Altman 's warehouse : " Please Do Not Back Your Truck in Until the Door Is Opened . " And a girl named Rosamay was strolling on Amsterdam Avenue the other day , and saw in the window of a bakery a sign reading , " Fresh today  --  Lemon Moran Pie . " Tenorelli FEELING that we should perhaps tell you something about Joseph Bentonelli , who made his breathlessly sudden debut at the Met a couple of weeks ago , we called on him in his rooms at the Roosevelt . It was quite an interview , taking one thing with another . Mr. Bentonelli has an impressive presence : tall , black-haired , pale of face , with a high forehead and beetling brows . He wore a tweedy suit , a scarlet woollen shirt , and a black-and-white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interview , he said , " Why on the pow ? Why not wait for the phuh ? " We just looked at him . He pointed a finger straight at the tip of our nose , and said , " When you drop a stone into a pond , it goes pow . That 's my debut in Manon . ' But everybody waits for the splash  --  phuh  --  to see if the stone really has any weight . My second appearance , in Gianni Schicchi , ' on the twenty-seventh , that 's the phuh . " With some vague idea of starting the interview all over again , we asked him about his name : why , we asked , was it Joseph ? ? Bentonelli , instead of a completely Italian Giuseppe Bentonelli , or a completely American Joseph Benton , as he was christened ? " If I suddenly became Benton again , after singing since 1928 as Bentonelli , " he said , " I would be two individuals , would n't I ? " " Yes , " we said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " All American-horn Italian children are given American Christian names , " he told us quietly . We were puzzling over that ( he 's a thoroughbred American ) when he suddenly flung his arms wide apart , like an eagle in full flight . " Shakespeare says , ' What 's in a name ? ' " he roared . The story of his life  --  from Sayre , Oklahoma , by way of the University of Oklahoma Glee Club and Jean de Reszke to his engagement by the Met management to replace Richard Crooks in the role of Des Grieux ut " Manon " on about thirty hours ' notice  --  is pretty well known , and we 'll just tell you the things we do n't remember seeing in any of the newspapers . We read somewhere that he was forced to take the name of Bentonelli in Italy because he had been singing as M. Bonton , and everybody thought he was French . That 's wrong ; he was at that time billed as Benton , and people thought he was French because everybody pronounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was singing in Italy it might be healthier to be taken for an Italian than for a Frenchman , hence Bentonelli . He got his contract at noon on the ' Thursday before his debut , and was immediately whisked upstairs to a practice-room , where two conductors , working in relays , put him twice through the r6lc he was to d sing the next day . He then went back to his hotel and o sat up until dawn , poring over the score . Then , after only an hour of sleep , he went back to the Met for more rehearsal . He swears he was n't nervous as the opera started , except that for the first few minutes he could hear his heart more plainly than the music . " I was really terribly calm , " he says . " Cool as a fish . " His first congratulatory wire , oddly enough , came from those two opera-lovers , Joan Crawford and Franchot Tone . Mr. Bentonelli does n't think much of New York . " Decadent and provincial " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he shouted at us . " California ! " We may have looked a little dubious , because he spread-eagled again , and bawled , " I know what I 'm talking about . " Just before we left , he seized our lapel and said , " Do you know that the University of Oklahoma has the third largest Fine Arts enrollment of any state university in the country ? " We said we had n't known . " Do you know what the State of Oklahoma is made of ? " he asked I 'Ve said we did n't . " Heartache and blood ! " he thundered . Jotting FROM Charlottesville , Virginia , comes probably the last story we shall ever print about something written by a colored maid . ' We just could n't resist this one , which deals with a determined young Negress who is going on with her schooling in addition to serving the lady who sent us the story . She ( the lady ) went out into the kitchen on the maid 's afternoon off , and found on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes . At the top of the paper was drawn a triangle , and underneath was written firmly , " To prove , that Angle A is equal to Angle B. " Then followed a blank space , indicating thought and reflection , and then , at the bottom of the sheet , were these words : " I wish we could have one meal on time . " Gun-Toting NOW and then somebody or other asks us ( people think we know everything ) just what is the Sullivan Law , anyway ? And about the right and wrong of owning guns , etc. , generally . So we went down to Police Headquarters one day to find out . Well , let 's see . Suppose we begin with your wanting to buy a pistol . You go first to your precinct station and make out an application . If you have a police record , or are insane , or if your " temperament is unreliable " ( that is , we suppose , if you are inclined to fire nervously at the front door every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are really only two standard reasons for possessing a gun : for protection of " premises and property , " and for the transporting of valuables ( if you make a practice of that ) . You ca n't get a permit just because the Spencers ' dog growls at you or because some hot-tempered club member is mad at you . Some permits may he granted for very special reasons , but we were n't let in in any  --  they do n't unburden their hearts to you at Headquarters . Anyway , about thirty thousand persons in New York City had licences to carry guns , at the last count . After you fill out your application , your fingerprints are taken for the Criminal Identification Division , just in case . ( If your application is rejected , your fingerprints are kept just the same . ) Practically-everybody in the Police Department has to approve of your having a gun . If you 're approved of , you get a licence ( it costs $1.50 ) and with it a coupon to give to the man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add here that if you ever get hard up and want to pawn your gun , you ca n't do it in this city . Formerly you could , but you ca n't now . If you have a pistol in your bureau or your hip pocket , without a licence , and are arrested for it , you can get anywhere from six months to three years in jail and be fined $500 to boot , under the Sullivan Law . Second offence , five years . If the unlicenced gun is used in a crime , you can get ten years under that law just for having the gun , no matter how bad your aim was . You tan carry a toy gun or an imitation gun , all right , but if you threaten anybody with it ( even if it 's a candy gun ) , you can be fined or jailed . However , you can carry a real rifle or shotgun right up Fifth Avenue , the cops told us . That comes under the constitutional right of citizens to bear arms ( that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't fire one off ; there 's a city ordinance against that . ( In general , the New York City ordinances supplement the federal law and the Sullivan Law . ) Exceptions to this ordinance include the Commissioner of Water Supply , who may shoot gulls that come bothering around Central Park reservoir . Nobody can carry a sawed-off shotgun or a machine gun  --  nobody , that is , except the police , the military , bank guards , and such folk . It is also illegal in this state to own a blackjack , slung shot , sandbag , sand-
