The lynch law of Latin American justice is the " ley de fuga " ( law of flight ) . This is supposed to empower police to shoot fleeing prisoners , but in practice often means that a troublesome prisoner is set free , then drilled before he can scoot out of range . From Len in Mexico 's State of Guanajuato last week came a tale of ley de fuga perfect except in one particular . <P> With seven bullets in his back , Cattleman Tomas Manrique was found by pass ers-by and bundled off to a hospital . There he explained that after having been falsely arrested for stealing 50 head of cattle , he was set free in a deserted spot . Before Tomas Manrique had taken three steps toward liberty , a rattling volley cracked . He expected to make ley de juga history by recovering .
