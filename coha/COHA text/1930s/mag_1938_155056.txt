Atop the frowning , canyon-like sides of the upper reaches of China 's mighty Yangtze River a strange procession last week inched its way westward . Strung out for miles along the cliffs , with the river swirling over the rapids hundreds of feet below , 7,000 coolies pulled 7,000 jinrikishas , part of a stream of thousands of refugees who had chosen to flee Hankow rather than live under Japanese rule . Piled inside the tottering rikishas were all the manhole covers , sewer gratings and radiators the Chinese could gather before the Japanese captured the city on October 26 . The destination of this scrap-iron convoy is Chungking , China 's new capital 500 miles upriver from Hankow , where the junk will be converted into shrapnel . <P> Little did it matter to these refugees that it had taken two months of hardship to reach where they were last week , somewhere between Ichang and Chungking , that it probably would take them another month to scramble through the Yangtze gorges to their goal . They were on their way to China 's " promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies . <P> The " New China " that foreigners have known since 1927 , when Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek took over the Government , was the China of the seaboard provinces . Most of it is now ruled by Japanese arms . Its capital , Nanking , centre of the web of roads , railways and airlines which Chiang Kai-shek spun across the map of China , fell to the Japanese a year ago last week . New China moved westward to Hankow and carried on . Two months ago advancing Japanese forces straddled both ends of the vital Canton-Hankow railway ( completed in 1936 ) which skirted the western frontier of Chiang 's original New China . Once again New China trekked westward-to a new place on the map . <P> New " New China . " Many civilizations have spread but not since the fall of Constantinople in 1351 has there been such a striking example of a whole civilization pulling up its roots and moving elsewhere . The Government , the Army , much of China 's cultural and industrial life and millions of refugees from the devastated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China " in the hinterland which had been frantically prepared during 18 months of war . The new " New China " is composed of the provinces of Yunnan , Kwangsi , Kweichow , Szechuan , Kangsu , Sikang , Tsinghai , and the Chinese Communist-held province of Shensi-places which two years ago seemed to most Chinese as remote as Alaska is to New Yorkers . <P> The heart of this new country is the mountain-girdled upper valley of the Yangtze , an area approximately 1,000 miles from East to West and 1,300 miles from North to South . Below it lie the steaming jungles of Burma and French Indo-China , west of it lie the mountain fastnesses of Tibet , northwestward the desert plateaus of Turkestan ( Sinkiang ) and Mongolia . <P> Here Chiang Kai-shek is trying to keep his nation together while he prepares to reconquer its old home by beating the Japanese . As he knew from the beginning the Japanese can be beaten only by exhaustion , and for that purpose he is training his troops in small mobile units for hit- &-run; attacks on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
