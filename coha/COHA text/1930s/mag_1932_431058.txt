 | I AM an old-fashioned woman , true to the tradition that being a wife is a full-time job . A wife wants to make her husband 's path as smooth as possible . She likes to obliterate annoyances . Above all , she loves to help . That means assuming responsibility . It just happened that adding the tasks of a secretary to those of a wife and mother fitted into the pattern of our life , according to my conception of a wife 's work . Perhaps I have assumed rather excessive responsibilities . Assumed , I say , for never have they been thrust upon me . They have come naturally as part of the fifty-fifty division in partnership with a man whom I consider great . Since Mr. Garner became Speaker and people have been wanting to know more about us , I have often thought of advice given me many years ago . Not long after the Congressional Club was founded by the wives of Senators and Congressmen , I was elected its treasurer . To me fell the business of instituting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expert accountant at the Treasury ' . " There are many ways of keeping books , Mrs. Garner , some of them complicated , some of them not at all so , " he explained to me . " My suggestion is that you make your bookkeeping so simple that any one can come and see what has been done . " That made a profound impression upon me . It exactly expressed my idea of public life . Always we have tried to live up to it . We do not deserve much personal credit for the economy and simplicity with which we live today . It is the normal result of our early life . I was reared in southwest Texas , on a ranch twenty-two miles from our present home in Uvalde . I was taught to darn stockings and to mend my own clothes . Every afternoon during vacations I had to sit down and sew . Never was I allowed to use the sewing machine until my stepmother considered my hand-sewing as good as the mechanical stitches . I had to tend the chickens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cook ? I love to cook and wash dishes ? the servants had orders never to clean up after me.  | " You 'll never be able to direct any one else if you ca n't do it yourself , " Mother would say . She taught me to be thorough . " Ettie , have you dusted the piano ? Well , I think I 'd do it over again . " I 've never ceased to dislike dusting and cleaning , however . My father and our nearest neighbor , who lived four miles away , built a oneroom schoolhouse for the two families . There I studied until I was twelve under the best of teachers , Mr. Meserve . While such an upbringing does not incline one to take naturally to extravagance and luxury , it does give one a true understanding of values . The life we lived on the frontier , in my youth and in the early days of our marriage , was such a happy one that it has served as the model on which we have lived ever since . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mr. Garner 's secretary came about in the most natural way . I was an orphan when I finished school , and lived n ith my brother , who was away most of the time looking after the ranch . A friend of mine who was studying stenography in San Antonio suggested that I join her . I thought it would be interesting , and my brother encouraged me . I never expected to use it , however , because my brother felt that if I took a job I would deprive some one else of a livelihood . What little things are sometimes responsible for the course of a whole life ! On the train to San Antonio , on the way to those very shorthand lessons , I met John Garner ; a mutual friend introduced us . He had come down from Red River County to live in Uvalde . Soon after my course was finisher. we were married . There is little similarity in appearance between the slender young man of twenty-five I married and the Speaker of today ; only the look of his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect He is not so good-looking now , but the very lines w e women deplore do give character . In many ways he was much the same as he is now . Always kind and considerate under a bluff manner . Temper quick , words out , and the episode finished and forgotten . He had the  | same aggressive fighting spirit . He was a county judge when he was twenty-three , before ! we were married . When opposition to his reelection arose , he packed some dried meat and a gun into his saddle-bag , and started out to scour the chaparral for delegates . His friendships are deep and sincere . His affection for Mr. Longworth , for instance , was great , though he did not hesitate to attack the former Speaker on the floor when he differed with him . But their differences of opinion did not affect their personal relations . I enjoyed my home in the early days of our marriage . In the congenial work of homemaking and rearing my baby boy I was quite content . No wonder that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned to use instead of words . When our son was about five years old , Mr. Garner decided to make the campaign for Congress . We had no extra money , so I decided to brush up on my shorthand to help him through the campaign . It was a labor of love ; never for an instant did I believe an unknown young lawyer could be elected . By the time the campaign was over , however , though I had gained little confidence in my husband 's future career in Congress , I had acquired a lot of assurance in my own ability to help him in his work . Though under the conviction that Mr. Garner could not possibly be elected to succeed himself , I continued to do the secretarial work . When I realize how little belief I had in my husband 's ability to succeed in those days , I wonder that my very lack of faith did not have some detrimental effect upon his advancement . By the time he was re-elected for the first time I had become accustomed to acting as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in school , and I wanted something to do . At the end of four years I was beginning to know my job . I liked the work , and hated to think of putting someone else in my place . So we put if off . The idea of having a new secretary grew less agreeable each succeeding election . Finally it ceased to concern us . I had become a fixture . Early Days in Washington When-we first came to Washington during the Roosevelt administration there was no House office building . Each member looked for a convenient nook in which to do his work . e found it expedient to attend to ours in our hoarding house . There the mails were delivered , one in the morning , the other late in the afternoon : two mails for Mr. Garner to attend to before he left the house in the morning . While I typed the letters , Mr. Garner took care of his departmental work , on his way to the Capitol . At that time this was not too strenuous , for a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his duties after he has been in office for years . Today , however , the bulk of the nation 's business has so increased that even the most recently elected members have not the leisure enjoyed by those of thirty years ago . I was able to finish my work in a few hours each day . Thus I had ample time for sightseeing , calling , and other social pleasures . Actually , these pleasures were few , although I thought the calendar crowded and magnificent . I can smile now at the serious way I studied the book wherein were revealed the Social Laws ; on whom I should call , who must call on me , when I should call , et cetera . With what eagerness I listened to the words of wisdom that fell from the lips of those wlia had already " learned the ropes . " How grateful I was for guidance ! Life was simple then . A party was a rare thing , something to be anticipated . Bridge was in its earliest infancy . Calling was our great occupation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we went the rounds religiously . You could follow us , like people lost in the woods , by the trail of cards we left . Naturally we left cards at the White House  | first . If , however , you wanted to pay your respects to the President 's wife less perfunctorily , you telephoned her social secretary and arranged it . Usually you were invited , with several others , for tea some afternoon . When you arrived at the Executive Mansion you were received in one of the smaller reception rooms . The tea table , over which the social secretary presided , was pretty ; the President 's wife chatted with you ; you had your cup of tea and a cake that tasted particularly good because it was baked in the White House , and left , feeling warm and pleasant . You had become an entity to the First Lady of the Land . You went home and told your husband and your friends everything the President 's wife had said , described what she wore , and how the tea table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new idea for your own . I think that neighborly way is better than the formal , remote manner of the present time . In the pre-war administrations entertaining was less restrained . I liked it . I think it would engender a comfortable , friendly feeling to have the First Lady occasionally call up a few women , wives of Senators and Representatives , and informally invite them to lunch or tea . Such small , spontaneous gatherings , talking without regard for conventional formality , would bring about closer relations between the law-makers and the White House . Every man wants his wife to be happy . Every woman naturally is delighted by intimate parties in high places . I Like Informal Friendliness Such informal tactics would not change a single vote , but Congressmen and Senators would be pleased . There would be a relaxation of attitude which would make it easier for them to get together . It 's possible ? and is n't it desirable ?  - -  to have an old-fashioned , neighborly feeling among the members of the governing body . But to get close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I used to enjoy the social life , though after about ten years it began to be rather monotonous . I always had my tea in my parlor , when I had a home . Afternoon teas formed our most important daytime function . We did not have the elaborate luncheon parties of today , at which richly-dressed women sit about flowerdecked tables until time for their next engagement . Tea parties were always home parties . We each usually gave one a season though occasionally some of the wives would cooperate on a big one . Now , however , since we have been living in a hotel , I have given up entertaining entirely . It has been several years since I gave a party . I do not believe official entertaining is obligatory . I think Alice Longworth proved that . We have grown extravagant , here in Washington , in our idea of what is necessary in our social life . Society is not essential . Constituents do not send their representatives to Congress for a gay life ; they send them to conduct the affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are important to their husband 's progress . This is often a commendable wifely attitude , but it is ill-advised . I doubt if the social efforts of official wives are ever of material benefit . On the other hand , they may be a decided drawback . - Well-intentioned women cultivate the wives of those important to their husbands , under the delusion that they are influencing legislative opinion . The ruseis never successful . The question usually arises , " What do you suppose she 's after ? " I myself have been invited again and again by women who did not know me at all . I knew it could n't be my charm and fascinating ways that attracted them . I am glad I had those first few years of moderate leisure in which to learn the little ins and outs of Congressional life . I have no time for it now . None at all . We decided to attend only two official functions in the year : the President 's dinner in honor of the Speaker and the reception tendered the Speaker and his  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an unexpected extra one , such as , for instance , the dinner given by Mr. and Mrs. Hoover to the Italian Foreign Minister and Signora Grandi . In the early days I made friends who will never be forgotten . A few of them are still here . One of them is Representative Florence Kahn of California . At rare intervals nowadays she and I meet in the corridors of the Capitol , exchange news of our children , and recall the days when we washed their clothes in the basin and hung them out of the window to dry . Then , too , there is Mrs. Joseph M. Dixon , wife of the Assistant Secretary of the Interior , who was my running mate for years . Our friendship will last as long as life . The first three years of our life in Washington we boarded , as I have said . Finally we took an apartment at the Burlington , and for thirteen years we lived there , first in apartn ents without housekeeping facilities . A holiday drove us into orthodox domesticity ; We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight o'clock and found no breakfast . " Oh , it 's a holiday , " we were told . " On holidays we do n't serve breakfast until nine . " I marched out to the desk . " Do you have regular apartments with kitchens ? " I inquired . They had , so we moved into an establishment of four rooms , one of which we reserved for office work exclusively . Thus I could combine both home and business life . I had my housekeeping down to such a system that it dovetailed smoothly with my other work . I was aided by extremely efficient and loyal maids . In all those years I had only three different ones . I went early to the market three times a week , often before full daylight . By eight o'clock all my groceries were in the house , and orders given for the day . As soon as breakfast was over we took up the mail . After my son was on his way to school , before nine , and Mr. Garner had departed a little later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning to myself . Like most conscientious mothers , I made it a rule to be at home when my son returned from school , as long as he was in the grades . As soon as he arrived , we arranged our program together : I knew what he was to do ; he knew where I was going . In such ways my work and play were interwoven . I do not recall that one ever interfered with the other . New Responsibilities As the years passed , and Mr. Garner continned to be re-elected , he naturally acquired more and more influence . He rose from the insignificant committee on which he was first placed until he was elected to the important Ways and Means Committee . With that increased importance came more and more work . Almost imperceptibly my working hours grew longer . At last , scarcely noting the change , I found myself working all day long every day . After Mr. Garner became ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee , he had less time for the detail Work of the office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I first began my feeble I efforts at being a secretary , Mr. Garner had to dictate each word of every letter . Today he merely reads a letter and says , " Tell this man such and such . " I build a complete letter on one sentence . Through years of close working association I have learned to use his language . I often say I know how to use just the right cuss word in the right place , and no one can tell he has not dictated every bit of the letter . After Mr. Garner was elected Minority Leader , our office force was increased . But the work increased even more , and I found I had less time for outside things than ever before . Now that he is the Speaker , our work has pyramided again . While we thought we had always known what work was , we found we were mistaken . Nowadays Mr. Garner gets to the office at 7:30 . He always has breakfast , but as I do not ,  | and prefer to walk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By that time the first mail has been delivered . I read and sort all the letters , and distribute them for answering . The details of our District I take care of myself . The folks out there know it and they seem to give me more credit for , it than I deserve . Mr. Garner makes suggestions about the letters we give him , and at 8:3o he begins to see people , and those conferences continue until he receives the newspaper men at 11:45 . When the conferences begin , the rest of us get to work on our mail . Then the second mail arrives , and at ten another , a heavy one requiring an hour to read and sort . We make it a rule to push every request , every veteran or1 pension claim. , Duties of this sort fall to me . , Then , too , we answer every letter , if merely with an acknowledgment . It is far from a pleasant business these days . Our mails are so often records of tragedy , telling , as they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have just been reading one from a man who says he and his wife and four children are hungry sixty percent of the time ! We tell them that every method to press legislative help is being employed . It seems scant consolation . Mr. Garner knows nothing about the details . Still he blares out every once in a while and gives us all ideas . He never was a man for details . I have to remember every little thing for him , even to getting another box of his Christmas cigars out of the refrigerator in the restaurant . I think that 's as it should be . Women have a gift for such matters . Our Busy Lives We are so busy we have our lunches in the office , in relays ? never sociably , all at once . We send for sandwiches , make coffee on our two electric coffee pots , and go right on working . Sometimes some one will come in to join the one who is lunching . For instance , the other day one of the women guides in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for coffee with me . It is hard work , but absorbing . God willing , I shall be my husband 's secretary as long as he is a member of the House of Representatives . When he is no longer a member of the House , I shall no longer serve as his secretary . Naturally we do not finish in the office until late . Then Mr. Garner and I go to our hotel , where we have a little two-room apartment , and have our dinner in the dining room at 6:30 . Sometimes we talk to friends in the lobby afterward . Sometimes we go to the movies . Our lights are always out early . Mr Garner and I never talk politics out of the office , though naturally I am interested in what he has been doing : I am never long in the dark , however . In the morning , when Mr. Garner sits across from me with the mail , from a sentence here and an assertion there , I can piece out all he has been working a the day before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I learn everything that has been going on . That comes from having taken one man 's dictation for thirty years . I am always careful when I ask questions , for I do not wish to add to the weight of his problems . When he comes in looking worried and burdened , and I have something to ask , I write a letter and put it in front of him on the desk . If he signs it , I know it is all right for me to talk to him . If he pushes it aside , I know the moment is not propitious , and wait . My work takes up so much time that I do not even get out to shop . The plain black dresses I 'm wearing in the office were purchased for me by my daughter-in-law before we left home . My friends here sort of look out for me . ' The other day one of them ' phoned and said , " There 's a dress on F Street that looks just like you . " As soon as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I needed a dress , and thought that would save time . But it was gone . I do not even have time to buy everything I need in one shopping expedition . It took me days to find time to go out after new shoe strings ! I bought a pretty black lace dress for @#  | dinner at the White House one day , and had to 1 wait until the next to take time off to get the slippers . It required a third foray to secure gloves . I said I hoped Mrs. Hoover would n't mind seeing me again in the same gown I had worn at the Grandi dinner . I do the same things months on end here in Washington , but I save up little tasks to do around the apartment on the rare occasions when Mr. Garner has to go out with men . Then responsibility just rolls away . I read ; I sew ; and do all the little odds and ends I neglect when he 's in the apartment . I want him to have all the peace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my own clothes , but I always brush and press and mend and clean spots off Mr. Garner 's , too , until they really have to go to the cleaner 's . In the past we have always had to practice small economies in order to save money for the important things , for we have always lived on Mr. Garner 's salary . Moreover , I 'm used to it . Down in Texas where we live there were no drycleaners in the early days . A wife just had to keep her husband 's things clean and tidy , that was all . I 've always taken pride in attending to such details myself . Even had I been rich in my youth , I could n't have done much differently , for I should have had to stand over a servant and show her how it should be done . I must say I 've always been proud of my mending . No one could ever tell that the elbow of my office dress is darned and patched . Once when my boy was young and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl pinned it to the sofa with a safety pin . When he got up , it tore . She felt dreadful , but he consoled her : " Do n't worry . Mother will patch it so it wo n't show . " That 's the kind of reputation I had . I still love to sew , to crochet , to cook , and to work in my yard . I 've been handy and economical so long now that I dare say nothing could change my ways . They are fixed habits . Mr. Garner and His Work Come First Material things never seem important anyhow . Mr. Garner and his work are the outstanding facts in my life . I 've been asked if I did not give up the Speaker 's car reluctantly . Actually I never thought about it enough to care one way or another . We had a car as long as our son was with us . When he went into the army in 1917 I drove it myself . In 1919 , when we sent all our furniture back to Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another here . I 've grown accustomed to not having one . When the question came up , it was no deprivation to do without it . I could walk , or take the street car to town , as before , or a taxi . Moreover I still have the old wifely attitude that if my husband thought it best that we should n't have the car , it was best . Mr. Garner did n't approve of the government 's maintaining a car for the Speaker when Champ Clark was in office . He does n't like these small expenses ; they all lump up into big ones . Mr. Garner realizes the importance of an accumulation of little things , just as he understands the greater issues . He is profoundly aware of the fact that he has come to power at a critical period . He is desirous that his work as Speaker shall fulfill , in so far as it is possible , the needs of the nation ; and that it shall meet with the satisfaction of his colleagues who have so signally honored him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovations to this end is the " policy committee , " composed of Democratic leaders of both House and Senate . Their function is to formulate general party policy on proposed legislation . Here viewpoints are reconciled , controversies eliminated , legislative programs agreed upon , and the party geared to act in smooth cooperation in both chambers , instead of independently , with frequent friction , as in the past . He is using every effort to maintain harmony at all times , for the widest and deepest public  | good . This is a great responsibility , which I bear too , vicariouslyI am learning , however , and I believe that God directs everything . I am not a pious woman in the church-going sense , for these days I have all too little time for worship in church . I often have to be in the office on Sunday mornings . That does n't bother me too much . Religion does n't amount to anything if it is not in every moment of everyday life . I know that if I daily and steadily trust myself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I am at home on our farm , I leave every door and window open even when I am alone . I have no fear . I believe in God 's protection . I do n't pray much , like other people . The very words , " God help me solve this problem , " are my deepest prayer . It 's not necessary , unless you want it , to have an elaborate form to tell Him what you need and what he ought to do for you . He knows and is caring for you , now as ever . That 's my belief . I do n't intrude it on anybody else . Other people are privileged and welcome to think the way they want to . Certainly no restrictions should be laid on that . A Woman 's Party In the crisis in which the world is suffering today I think women have two outstanding duties : to be strong in their faith , and to accept the need for retrenchment , to do it gracefully . and to make their homes and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else women can do is the problem of each individual . If you read the stories of the women whose husbands made history , you will find that most of them stayed home and directed their domestic affairs . And , today if each woman who has a home , would , stay in it and attend to it , all this restless disquiet would cease . Once simplicity is a reigning virtue , we shall be a happier people . The little things of life give the greatest contentment . The more simply we live , the more evenly money is distributed . We were talking of that not long ago . Representative Fishburne of Virginia , an applegrower ; stopped in to see if the apples he had sent us for Christmas were gone yet . " I wo n't let you get away without a bag of paper-shelled pecans grown on our own trees , " I told him . just then Mr. Garner came in . " Well , Mrs. Garner and I have solved the problem of living , " Mr. Fishburne said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But the economic issues of the day are Mr. Garner 's field , not mine . He is the expert . I do n't have independent political convictions . I do n't consider that I know enough of the big subjects to have valuable opinions . If my husband were out of political life , I should retreat to my own fireside and never have anything to do with public affairs again . I usually agree with my husband . I have always found him just . It is , of course , impossible to have lived thirty-seven years with a man in politics and not have plenty of ideas . Sometimes I have differed with him . Then he has shown me my error , and how matters would work out if done my way . We women ca n't see every point of a question the way a man does . He gets out among men as a woman never can . I do n't believe she should . Nevertheless I believe that a woman , no matter how strong her husband , molds him unconsciously , unnoticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago that I have an unfortunate habit of summing up personalities ; when I meet new people I 'm rarely mistaken in my conclusions . I 'm good at sizing them up . After a bit I noticed that sooner or later Mr. Garner would be holding or reflecting my opinion of them . So I 'm always careful now to say nothing . It 's better for a husband to mold his wife 's opinions than for her to mold his . If a woman has independent ideas , she ought to give them up . ( Remember , these are the  | views of a woman with old-fashioned ideas . They have served me well . ) At least , she ought to cease discussion of them if she ca n't give them up , especially if antagonism is to result . When her ideas conflict with her husband 's decidedly , she must never tell them . That 's another case of airing your own wash on the public line . I think it 's dangerous . I have found my life , with its basis of wifehood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me into the realm of public affairs in the wake of my husband has made it as interesting as it has been arduous . Still , I am always aware of our rambling house at home , the garden , the pecan trees , my son , snugly settled with his wife and child in his own home on our land ; the cooking , the visiting with neighbors , the homeliness and domesticity which is at the core of our lives .
