Astronomers suspect that all the 92 known elements are present to some extent in the sun . Up to last week they had identified 58 . Last week , phosphorus was quietly plucked out of the limbo of uncertainty to take its place as the 59th . <P> Forthcoming from Dr. Charlotte Emma Moore , 35-year-old Princeton Observatory researcher already known for her spectroscopic measurement of sunspot temperatures , the identification followed a triangular cooperation . Dr. Moore took some especially clear laboratory spectra of phosphorus provided by Dr. Carl Clarence Keiss of the Bureau of Standards , compared them minutely with some very faint lines lately observed on the infra-red solar spectrum by Mount Wilson 's Harold Delos Babcock , found that three lines coincided . <P> A new eleven-year sunspot cycle was ushered in last autumn when Mount Wilson observers spotted two faint spots too far from the solar equator to be survivors of the old cycle , too small to have any effect on earth . Last week near the sun 's eastern edge erupted a whirling blot 16,000 miles across . Astronomers predicted magnetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun 's rotation wheeled it out of sight , thought it might grow big enough to be seen with the unaided eye through smoked glass .
