A sight that might make any monarch quail last week faced Denmark 's tall , saturnine King Christian X. The great , eight-sided courtyard of Amalienborg Palace was jam-packed with strapping , irate Danish farmers in the grip of a grievance . The King , as he peered from his palace , noted on some brawny arms the swastika band of the Danish Nazis , on others the hammer &; sickle of Communism ( see p. 18 ) . The mob had gathered from the eastern Danish islands , where little farms are thickest , to demand that Premier Theodore Stauning lower farm taxes , raise farm prices , declare a farm mortgage moratorium and dismiss politicians from the Government 's agricultural bureaus . In a huff the Premier refused to see the farmers ' delegates . Thereupon the whole 50,000 surged to the Royal Palace . <P> Squatting on their heels , the farmers watched a change of the palace guard , grinned at this show of pomp . Still squatting , they watched King Christian appear on a balcony . Said His Majesty : " Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to negotiate with the Premier . I hope that your justifiable grievances may produce a remedy . " At this the farmers good-humoredly raised a cheer for perspiring King Christian , then squatted , Gandhi-fashion , for a total of four hours . <P> Finally to get them on their feet again , Premier Stauning received their delegates . <P> " I promise on behalf of the Government , " said he , " to give your demands the most earnest study . " At this the 50,000 farmers dispersed to their homes but their spokesman declared : " We 'll be back soon enough , if Stauning does n't do what 's right ! " That there was no violence last week in the Royal Palace square was due largely to the Farmers ' Association which appealed to city folk : " Go down to the street , find a farmer , and invite him to spend the night with you ! " Response was so wholehearted that all 50,000 farmers had been comfortably bedded and adequately breakfasted by sagacious city folk before they set out to mob Amalienborg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
