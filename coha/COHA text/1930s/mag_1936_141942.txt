A Louisiana judge , a juvenile officer and a welfare worker decided that Mrs. Erne Crawford was fit to mother the baby boy whom she first swore a brindle dog dropped at her Louisiana cabin door , then admitted she had borne guiltily back of her woodshed ( TIME , Nov. 23 ) . Louis Crawford , her pious , abstinent , pale-eyed cuckold , after a good tussle with the Holy Spirit , last week pulled in his horns , took Effie and their two young sons across Lake Pontchartrain to New Orleans ' Charity Hospital to claim the babe . <P> As the complex Crawford family left the hospital , freighted with baby formulas , feeding schedules and pediatric advice which they could scarcely follow in their one-room shack . Effie told the world at large : " We all 's gon na name the baby Bert J. Moses Crawford . The Bert J. do n't mean anything , but we do n't want people calling him Moses . "                 @ @ @ @
