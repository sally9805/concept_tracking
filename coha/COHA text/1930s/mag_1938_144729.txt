Whether the American Newspaper Guild was to be a labor union or a professional society was settled at its first convention , in St. Paul in 1934 . The delegates realistically conceived the reporter as a creature of wages , hours and working conditions , bluntly declared that they wanted more , fewer and better , respectively . By the time its fifth annual convention met last week in Toronto , * the Guild was beyond all doubt a labor union . More than that : It was one of the most successful of the C.I.O. 's affiliates ( to Chairman John L. Lewis , its record was " magnificent " ) ; its struggle first for existence , then for recognition had become a fight for better contracts ; it had become an innovator in union procedure ; it had gone beyond business unionism to fight for its program in the political field . <P> The past year has been the most important in the Guild 's brief history . In 1937 , it had 11,112 members in editorial departments . Today , the convention was told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13,505 in editorial departments and 3,292 in the newly acquired commercial department jurisdiction . Total number of U. S. editorial workers eligible for Guild membership is about 25,000 . Since the last convention , the Guild conducted eleven strikes , more than in all its four previous years . About 450 strikers were involved , more than double the total ever on strike before . Of the eleven strikes , the Guild called nine " definite victories , " one lost , one ( Hollywood Citizen-News ) still in progress . <P> The signing of 40 contracts since the 1937 convention made collective bargaining the Guild 's most successful activity of the year . In all its previous history , the Guild had made only 37 contracts . In two respects , Guild agreements are rare in labor practice : <P> 1 ) Provision for dismissal indemnity . Of the Guild 's 84 contracts covering 90 papers , two radio stations and two syndicates , over 80 provide for severance pay ranging from one to 28 weeks ' salary for from one to 15 years of service . <P> 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to checkmate an excuse some publishers have used to discharge active members , Guild negotiators are meeting with increasing success in obtaining guarantees against economy layoffs for periods of four months to one year . The fact that newspapers must be produced every day even during depression helps to make such provisions feasible for the Guild . <P> The American Newspaper Guild has known but one President : Scripps-Howard 's mussy , curly-headed Columnist Heywood Broun . Hunched over a table like a rising half moon , Chairman Broun always sits when he presides over Guild conventions . After five conventions , Sitting Broun remains a good-natured , efficient chairman . Last week he was reelected by affectionate acclamation , but with little affection Executive Vice-President Jonathan Eddy was re-elected after two ballots . <P> * First convention of a C.I.O. union to be held in Canada ; picked by the Guild to emphasize its status as an " international union .
