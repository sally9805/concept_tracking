WITH the government substi- tuting a rotten-egg flavor for poison in its alcohol , and with the other banks rushing to the aid of Bank of United States depositors by loaning them money at five per cent , the holiday season took on something of the old-time Charles Dickens quality of kindliness . Peace on earth , goodwill toward men , became a reality . The man we have envied most these past weeks has been Shipwreck Kelly , on his lone y pole . His contemplation from that aloof height must have retained the integrity of bitterness , the constancy of contempt , looking down on the Broadway crowds paying their nickels to squint at him through the battered spyglasses of the concessionaires . NE year of our life we spent in Seattle , a trans-Cascadian hamlet noted for the beauty of its seven hills . We mostly remember our exile for one thing : the absence of seasons . In that soft land we missed the stern tread of the Eastern calendar  --  the snows of winter , the burst of spring , the buzz of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were roses at Christmas , and how we hated roses at Christmas . We were reminded of this the other morning riding downtown in the sub-way , when our gaze fell on a lady carrying pussywillows . The December pussywillow is a trick of unprincipled florists . Pussywillows at this season are unspeakable . Why , in this Yule-log month , must we be dung into a February thaw , slush underfoot , and the smell of wind over melting snow ? The march of the seasons is our beloved possession , and we are violently antipathetic toward anything that throws the year off its stride . Let greeting-card men suffer from Jack o ' Lanterns on May Day and from holly or the Fourth  --  it ought not he our cross to hear . F . kLLING in love with a girl in a book , as Dr. Henry van Thke pointed out , is the safest way of falling in love . " There are no complications " was the way the Doctor put it . While we do n't share the Doctor 's admiration for this American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep and penetrating philosophy of his remark . Americans are always , we admit , in quest of the fictive fay , in love with the " girl in the book . " Annually they turn to the department-store Santa Claus . Once they fell in love with a war to end war . Not long ago they fell in love with Wall Street , till the street turned out to be something of a wench . They are devoted to the standard heroine of romance , courtesy of De Mille . Every prospect pleases , whether the New Humanism or Com= or Marshall P. Wilder or Edgar Guest or Carrie Nation . Their most typical cities are Chicago and Los Angeles , each aware of its own glamour . Uncle Sam is really Peter Pan with a beard . The catch is  --  and this is the difficult situation the country has to face and the situation Dr. van Dyke failed to point out  --  the catch is that the girl in the book is never content to stay in the hook . That 's where the American habit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marries her , and then acts surprised and alarmed when the complications set in  --  even if the complications are nothing more than a couple of quarts of milk a day from the Walker-Gordon people . WE hear it rumored around that Western Union has a plan by which to get back at Postal Telegraph for having taken over the theatre-ticket business . Western Union is going to sell express money orders  --  sometimes as much trouble to get as tickets on the aisle for " Grand Hotel . " The American Express Company is in on the deal , we understand , and it will mean that a person can buy a money order without visiting a United States post office . A boon , a boon . Probably the next thing the telegraph companies will take over is cigar stores . Or possibly banks .

We ended by clipping them out and sending them to Arthur Brisbane . He 'll know how to handle them . a Brass Tacks SQOMERODY with sharp ears has re-ported to us a business conference held recently by two Garment Centre men , both in garments in a big way .

She sailed back on a recent midnight and hundreds were at the pier , asking for autographs and blowing kisses . Just prior to departing she had become the most talked-of young lady in the movies . By this time she has become the toast of countless cities and towns . A year ago Miss Dietrich appeared in a German picture at the Fifty-fifth Street Cinema . It ran for several weeks but attracted no special attention . For some years before , in Germany , she had played in movies , in musical shows , and even in Shakespeare and Shaw under the direction of Reinhardt . She was popular there but it took Hollywood to glorify her . Josef von Sternberg was the first of the people from Hollywood to see her . He went into a Berlin theatre just in time to hear her speak the line , in English : " Three cheers for the gentleman who has won the grand prize . " He immediately became excited and signed her up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he had gone to Germany to direct . This is one of the two pictures which brought her twice to Broadway almost simultaneously . The other picture , the American-made " Morocco , " also directed by von Sternberg , at whose instance she was brought over here , gave her the better chance , however . Miss Dietrich will be back in February . She hurried home to get there in time for her small daughter 's birthday , postponing several projects in Hollywood which were colossal . She spent only one day here before sailing , mostly in the company of Mr. and Mrs. Stroock of the Brooks Costume Company , who arc old friends and with whom she came over from Germany last spring . She bought shoes for herself , dolls for her daughter , and cigarettes for her husband , a Berlin gentleman named Siebert . She also had some strawberries ; she likes strawberries . The German actress first studied to he a violinist but an injury to her wrist kept her idle for six months and she drifted into the theatre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had twelve pieces of baggage when she arrived here in April ; two were violin cases , another contained a saw , which she plays with a bow , and another a portable phonograph . She lived quietly in Hollywood with a cook and a maid , a small woolly dog , and a Rolls-Royce . On her one free evening here she dropped into two or three shows . She likes to flit about . She speaks English charmingly , having studied it long ago . Mr. Stroock says she has a sense of humor as good as Mayor Volker 's . Germans boast of her intelligence and declare that she has the prettiest legs on the Continent Her nickname is Dutchy , but you 've got to know her pretty well . ?

He did it all by himself , and last week the resourceful newsreel people showed him telling about it . Several persons spoke to us about this , saying it was our duty to preserve such remarks for posterity , so we sent our stenographer around to the theatre to take down what the officer said . Patrolman Griffo : " At one-fifteen A.M. I was going on my way home and there was no trolley car in sight and so I decided I would stop down at this club . There was no one at this club and very shortly as I was finishing my coffee and sandwiches the doorbell rang and the owner opened the door and let them in . These four fellows came in .

They pushed us all into a corner and this guy Castiglia who had the real revolver said ' Stick ' em up high and get over there ' and pushed me into the corner . I pushed everything to the back , my belt and my revolver , so I put my hand in my pocket and I passed my shield from my pocket to the hack pocket and cocked my revolver . After they had soiched the two women and were about to soich the fellow standing next to me I saw this was my only chance so I grabbed this fellow Moreno and held him close to me as a shield so Castiglia would shoot him . I tripped and fell down with him as Castiglia fired four shots . Three missed me over my head and one striking Moreno in the abdomen .

Goodbye all . I 'll see youse later . " Pride of a Virtuoso EARLY in his winter 's concert tour , Jascha Hcifetz gave a recital in the small town of Northfield , Minnesota , near St. Paul . Next day the St. Paul Daily News gave an account of his appearance , in the course of which Debussy 's " La Fille aux Cheveux de Lin " was mistakenly stated to be the violinist 's own composition . It happened that in another story the Daily News had also mentioned , by way of color , that the violinist had met the local ping-pong champion in a match and had been defeated in three straight sets . Next day the editors discovered their musical error and were feeling pretty foolish about it , when it was announced that Mr. Heifetz was calling on the telephone . They got up their nerve and answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Debussy matter . that he complained . What he wanted to say was that the ping-pong score had n't been three-nothing against him , but three-one . Beaver THIS is the true story about Sir Hubert Wilkins ' beard , and although he has had it quite a time now , it seems interesting enough to record . When the explorer returned from the Arctic some years ago , he immediately shaved off the beard he had grown in the wastelands . Ile had no intention of wearing one in civilization . He visited , thus shorn , the home of a friend in London and was presented to the eightyear-old daughter of the house . She was not only unimpressed but hurt , for " Fancy that ! So you were a judge , too ! " " Pure , eh ? I tell you she glorified in nineteen-twenty. " she had been regaled with descriptions of Sir Hubert 's heard , and here he had none . She poured out her tearful disappointment to the surprised explorer and he promised her that next time he would live up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next long sojourn in the Arctic , he kept his heard , and paid another visit to This friend 's home .

Cheap ALADY who was as nearsighted as she was uninformed paused in astonishment at Fifth Avenue and Fifty-eighth Street . The garment strikers  --  that unhappy little group that have been picketing in front of Bergdorf Good-man 's ever since the warm weather  --  were sauntering wearily up and down , wearing , as usual , their banners of protest , which bear the name " Bergdorf Goodman " in large letters .

If you have a lion that needs to be bound or trimmed , there is the Lion Binding &; Trimming Company , and if you want to send someone a lion for Christmas , the Lion Packing Company . There must be hundreds of others . We 'll probably be hearing about them . Spare I our gay little span of years , we 1 have crept mouselike , or barged mouselike , into many amazing homes of rich people , but we have yet to visit as a guest what must from all reports he the most completely equipped private dwelling in America : Sidney Borg 's little place in Irvington .

Guests , horrified , rushed up and began picking up the more obvious fish ; and a multitude of servants appeared with rags and mops to do the real work of cleaning up the mess . Mrs. Borg , cool as a water lily , addressed the head butler . " Henri , the fish bowl has been broken . " " Yes , Madam , " said Henri , and disappeared through the door . To the great astonishment of everyone he reappeared three minutes later with an assistant , the two of them carrying another enormous goldfish bowl exactly like the first , and proceeded to set it deftly in place . This surprised even Mr. Borg . He knew he had a pretty nifty little establishment , but he had n't realized it was that good . Trick Animals JLTST a word about Messrs . Mess-more and Damon , who make mechanical animals . You may have seen some of their work at various shows ( they made the interfering cow in that skit about the milkmaid in the " Earl Carroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of their creations in department stores during this season . They 've been in the business for over twenty years ever since they met in New York at the time of the Hudson-Fulton Celebration in 19()9 . There was something very lucky about that meeting . Mr. Messmore had got his start as a stagehand , later having a good deal to do with backstage mechanics at the Metropolitan . Mr. Damon had begun as a butcher , after which he went to art school , finally coming to New York as one of the staff in charge of the Hudson-Fulton pageants . Between them , they decided they knew enough about anatomy , machinery , and stage effects to go into the mechanical-animal business for themselves . Most of their work now is done for department stores , to be used in window displays . Mr. Messmorc is still in charge of the mechanical effects , and Mr. Damon has to do with anatomy , though they now have a considerable corps of designers and mechanics to help them . They do animals to order , modelling them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally building up to the finished figure with layer on layer of heavy paper . They also have a large collection of animals already in stock , at their factory at 404 West Twenty-seventh Street , which they rent out  --  monkeys playing poker , lions that roar , claw , roll their eyes , that sort of thing . These are often sent out on extended tours of the country , travelling like road shows , specially boxed and shipped , accompanied by expert mechanics to operate them , playing one week in one city and then moving on to the next . Some of them are pretty complicated , too , and pretty expensive . There are , for instance , a mammoth and a dinosaur , both of which draw big crowds wherever they go . Both were built after museum reconstructions . The mammoth was a year in the making , and cost thirty-seven thousand dollars . His skin was made of the hides of over four hundred Mongolian goats , and he has sixteen electric motors inside him , to make him breathe , wiggle his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It took fourteen months to make the dinosaur . With a trained man at the switch , the dinosaur will leer at you , nuzzle your shoulder , and take a handkerchief from your hand , all very lifelike . It costs a department store sixty-five hundred dollars to exhibit them for two weeks , including a model caveman , to give atmosphere . Just now the firm is paying a good deal of attention to the Tom Thumb golf courses , working out trick devices . One of their creations is a figure dressed in convict 's clothes . You shoot through his legs , and the green is a miniature prison . Show Business AYOUNG lady who is making her way in the theatre called the other day at the offices of one of the prominent producers , who is casting a play . Several other hopeful young in-enues were aLso there , but when the producer took a look into his outer office he gave them not a glance , but settled his gaze upon the young lady and called her to an inner room .

" Here she is , Sam , " said the producer . " We 've got her . " The author frowned and shook his head . " Hope , " he said . " I 'm sorry , but she wo n't do . We 've got to get someone on the Miriam Hopkins type . "
