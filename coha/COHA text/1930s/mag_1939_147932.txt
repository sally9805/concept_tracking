By coincidence or not , the French forecast of a war of maneuver was preceded and followed by greatly increased activity of German patrols , all the way from the Moselle to the Rhine . Starting with dozens , the Nazi raids increased to as many as 80 in a single night , in such strength that even the tough Moroccans in the Wissembourg sector had to call for artillery support to blow the raiders back . The Germans tried a new system , approaching each French outpost in separate columns or files , to bomb it with grenades from three sides simultaneously . These raids , by seasoned troops , were interpreted by the French as " information please " parties ( TIME , Nov. 27 ) , to take the place of air reconnaissance which lately cost the Germans many a plane. * But the French took no chance on letting the scouts hold ground close up to their forward positions , which might prelude a general attack . <P> News correspondents were " temporarily " withdrawn from the French front Jines last week , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed , with a comrade , to spend three days and two nights at outposts held by Moroccans in the Vosges foothills near Wissembourg . His account of this trip was one of the first notable pieces of reporting in World War II . Excerpts : <P> " Looking as tough as saddle leather and about the same color from 20 years in the Moroccan sun and winds , the adjutant smiled , barked an order in Arabic and in less than a minute we were swinging off through the woods single file . Six riflemen were ahead and six behind . <P> " We followed the forest across a savage , rocky plateau full of heather down into a long crooked valley . <P> " Finally we came upon another officer in a clearing with 30-odd Moors . Though we had gone only two miles , it had taken us half an hour because of the ankle-deep mud in the valleys and the spongy ground in the hills . <P> " . . . The long-striding Moroccans . . . were not even breathing heavily . . . . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skies were already darkening fast . The officer ordered us to string out in file ten paces apart . <P> " The edge was slightly taken off the tingling realization that we might be ambushed any minute by the complete competence of our escort . <P> " When you are with these highly professional soldiers , men who have been fighting this kind of guerrilla warfare most of their lives , you can not help feeling unbounded confidence . <P> " It took us another half an hour to cover that last two miles before we came to a great wood-covered hill roughly shaped like a loaf of bread . We zigzagged our way up the side through barbed-wire entanglements , passages and trenches to the summit . <P> " Twilight was fast vanishing but it was still light enough to see hills , peaks , and valleys around us . " <P> His officer guide told Correspondent Downs : <P> " Immediately after dark this entire area becomes a sort of No Man 's Land , with patrols on both sides operating through the valleys . The Germans never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 40 , preceded by highly trained dogs which come to a silent ' point ' when they scent other men . <P> " Sometimes they bark . Sometimes we clearly hear unseen Germans in the woods softly calling ' Komm , komm ! ' Come , come .
