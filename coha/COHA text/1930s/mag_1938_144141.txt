The biggest of the ten important U. S. publishers of medical books , W. B. Saunders Co. * of Philadelphia , last week celebrated its 50th birthday . Although handsome President Lawrence Saunders might have saluted himself for his formidable list of 800 medical texts ranging from the late Physiologist Hobart Amory Hare 's Essentials of Physiology ( published in 1888 ) to Dr. Leon Herman 's The Practice of Urology ( published this week ) , he saluted another instead : Professor Max Brdel of Johns Hopkins , the first &; only professor of medical art in the world , illustrator of many Saunders books , crony of many Saunders authors . <P> Publisher Saunders had Artist Thomas Cromwell Corner paint a portrait of Artist Brdel wearing the sort of rumpled blue suit which Johns Hopkins medicos have seen him wear for 44 years . And at a jolly party in Philadelphia last week Mr. Saunders presented the portrait , to be hung in Johns Hopkins near the famed Sargent picture of the Four Doctors+ who organized that medical school . <P> Purpose of medical art is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human bodies and how to operate on them . Earliest known examples of medical art are Babylonian baked clay models of the liver . Earliest known medical painting represents the birth of one of Cleopatra 's babies . In the Italian Renaissance painters belonged to the Guild of Physicians &; Apothecaries , because they bought supplies from drugstores . Artists thus developed friends among doctors , and had opportunity to study anatomy . Leonardo da Vinci made more than 750 anatomical sketches , was the first to depict the true position of the fetus in the womb . <P> Johns Hopkins ' Max Brdel considers one of his finest works of art a picture of an unborn child cradled in a pelvis ( see cut ) . Gynecologist Howard Kelly taught Artist Brdel this phase of medical art . Dr. Kelly-just turned 80 and the only survivor of the Four Doctors-attended last week 's dinner . It was Dr. Kelly who got Max Brdel to leave his native Leipzig for Baltimore in 1894 to illustrate Kelly 's Operative Gynecology . That and other books by Dr. Kelly and Johns Hopkins doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's associate , Gynecologist Thomas Stephen Cullen , persuaded the late President Henry Walters of the Atlantic Coast Line R. R. to finance a chair of " Arts as Applied to Medicine " in Johns Hopkins . Associate Professor of Art Brdel gives a two-year course . Hardest thing to teach , says he , is " the use of highlights to represent the glistening character of fresh tissue , vessels , nerves and delicate structures of all kinds upon which , in medical drawings , so much depends . " Over 100 have graduated from this course since 1913 , among them his daughter , Elizabeth Brdel , who draws for the Women 's Clinic of New York Hospital . Few alumni lack work , for , as Max Brdel tells all his students : " Medical progress is swift and constant , and many a subject considered a closed chapter has been opened by some discovery , thus necessitating newly illustrated books .
