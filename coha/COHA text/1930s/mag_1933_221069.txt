Last week for the first time in 24 years , St. Louisans elected a Democratic Mayor . Victorious candidate was Bernard Francis Dickmann , 44 , bachelor realtor . A grey-haired , ruddy-faced , wisecracking good-timer . Mayor-elect Dickmann is president of the City Real Estate Exchange . A party worker for 20 years , he had never before run for office . <P> The St. Louis Democracy 's victory , an echo from last November , was far from complete . Republican Louis Nolte was re-elected city comptroller for the fifth time . Republicans retained a majority on the board of aldermen .
