During 1930 over $80,000,000 in cash was used for the retirement of bonds and $47,000.000 for construction and extension . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the year .

We have distributed our work among the most men possible . " Schwab Takes Credit for Bonus System Mr. Grace made a long statement concerning the bonus , saying that Mr. Schwab had sent letters to stockholders giving their side of the matter . Mr. Schwab followed , took credit for initiating the bonuses and explained the system under which they were administered . He called attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the more he considered the matter , the more he was convinced that those who had criticized the system and the payments he had made under it did not fully understand the underlying principle and the incentive method of compensation . Charles M. Schwab , chairman of Bethlehem , said that before anyone had asked questions , there were two he would like to be sure would be asked , and , therefore , he would state the two questions himself and answer them . The first question was : Why should the executive officers bonuses bo calculated after depreciation ? Mr. Schwab said that if this plan were not followed , there would be no incentive whatsoever to the officials to make a special effort to prevent a loss or.to keep the loss as small as possible . Mr. Schwab pointed out that there are no fixed rules for measuring depreciation . He added that if a bonus system were to be established , based upon earnings after depreciation , it would of necessity create an incentive to keep depreciation as low RS could be reasonably justified , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that he did not believe such an incent-ive would be advantageous . Speaker Makes Plea for Bonus System The second question which Mr. Schwab considered was with regard to whether it was fair for the corporation to pay executive bonuses during the periods when not paying common dividends . He pointed out that if the board of directors decided that the best interests of the corporation required that the dividends be withheld and the money used in the business , the assets of the corporation remain the same and so the interest of the stockholders is not changed . Mr. Schwab pointed out that during years when dividends were not paid but bonuses were paid , funds were used for the rebuilding of properties acquired during that period , and said that had the bonus payments been made after a dividend on the common stock , the incentive for such remodeling and rebuilding would have been withdrawn . Mr. Schwab made it clear that he believed that there is no relationship between the payment of bonuses and the payment of common dividends . He sumnmrizcd the result for the period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive bonuses were $25,151,218 , total earnings after all such bonus payments were $218 , - 577.368 . Total common dividends totaled $60 , - 121,300 , total preferred , $63,191,530 . Total added to surplus was $95,264,538 . After the conclusion of his printed remarks , Mr. Schwab Made an impassioned plea for the bonus system ; and said that the bonus system had done : nuch to benefit Bethlehem . Mr. Grace stated that the Mellon interests of Pittsburgh were among the largest holders of Bethlehem stock because of the acquisition of the ** Marshall company early this year , Mr. Schwab , in answer to a query by one of the stockholders , said that Mr. Grace had been reinvesting most of the hulk of the money received in bonuses in the past in Bethlehem stock . Schwab 's Salary Averaged $86,900 Mr. Schwab said that he had received from the Bethlehem Steel Corp . an average of $86,000 a year , and never had taken any bonus of any kind . From 1908 to 1920 , I received an average of $50,000 a year , said Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year . In 1930 , the hoard voted me $250,000 a year . Up to 1907 , I received no compensation of any kind . Mr. Schwab said : " In 1907 when Bethlehem needed money I gave as a bonus one-fifth of the stock , ray stock , to those who financed me . " At the conclusion of Mr. Schwab 's speech everyone rose to his feet , even the opposition , and applauded him . The opposing counsel individually went over to Mr. Schwab and congratulated him . C. D. Marshall was nominated for director to succeed James H. Ward . Vice Chancellor Backes , in giving his opinion , stated that those of the stockholders who signed proxies approving the bonus system did so on the faith of the management and without knowledge of " the real things at stake in this suit . " He also said he did not see what the defendants expected to gain by a probative vote , since such a vote could have no influence upon the right to relief of shareholders who had suffered injury by unlawful conduct . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premature , as had been alleged by the defendants , as the number of stockholders , 80,000 , made it impossible for them all to he present at the annual meeting to hear the chairmen account for the administration before voting .
