To blast a reservoir on his farm at Stanfordville , N. Y. , Dr. Edgar Ernst needed 50 Ib. of dynamite , ordered it sent by freight from the du Pont factory in Wilmington , Del . Last week , in a special car pulled by a special engine . Dr. Ernst 's dynamite arrived . Confronted with the difficulty of transporting a package no bigger than a soap box which was nonetheless capable of blowing up a complete train , du Pont had hired a whole boxcar , nailed the crate to the floor in the middle , sealed the doors , plastered the outside with placards screaming EXPLOSIVES ! The car was then coupled to a regular freight train , rolled north to Poughkeepsie . No freight train was available to carry the car on to Stanfordville , so it was coupled to an engine which made a special trip 15 miles up a little used line to Stanfordville . Obliging du Pont charged Dr. Ernst $1 for delivery .                 @ @ @ @
