Holiday ( Columbia ) has had a career as noteworthy as any U. S. play in the last decade . Written by Philip Barry and produced on the Manhattan stage in 1928 , it played to crowded houses throughout that pre-Depression season , set the style for a hundred-odd comedies of manners that followed it . Two years later , the first screen version , with Ann Harding , Mary Astorand the late Robert Ames in the leading roles , indicated amazingly that in talking pictures the cinema industry had found a medium which could rival the stage in its appeal to civilized , adult audiences . Now in its third edition , Holiday proves capable of providing one more shock . <P> Theme of Holiday is the dilemma of a young man forced to choose between marrying an heiress , who is ambitious to have him take a profitable job in her father 's bank , and his own desire to stop making money and take a holiday to find out what life is all about . Johnny Case solves his problem neatly by leaving his fiancee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eloping with her older sister , Linda , who shares his disdain for her family bankroll . If , even in 1928 , it was a little difficult to take seriously the plight of a hero and heroine whose chief problem was the prospect of having too much money , it would seem impossible to do so ten years later . Surprise of the third edition of Holiday is that it surmounts this apparent handicap without trying and emerges , thanks to Screenwriters Donald Ogden Stewart and Sidney Buchman , Director George Cukor and a cast brilliantly headed by Katharine Hepburn , as superior to both its high-grade predecessors . <P> In Holiday , Playwright Barry was , it now appears , touching a more delicate nerve centre than anyone could have guessed before Depression . Consequently , all Screenwriter Stewart had to do to make it look as though the play had been written yesterday was to underscore its already plotted class-angles . Thus , Julia Seton 's father becomes an anti-New Deal tory , who regards his prospective son-in-law 's distrust of rugged individualistic money-grubbing as dangerously unAmerican . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when his ambition to take a sabbatical is presented as evidence of liberal leanings . Linda relates , as her most embarrassing moment , being arrested for helping to lead a strike against a company in which Seton Sr. is a director . When she has to correct her father for failing to catch her sister 's nance 's name , she says : " It 's Case , not Chase , father-too bad , Chase had such a pleasant banking sound .
