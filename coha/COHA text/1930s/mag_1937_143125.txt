The Fireman 's Flame ( written and produced by Jerrold &; John Krimsky respectively ) is for beer drinkers in a whiskey mood . It records a seething rivalry between two rival fire companies in Manhattan 's 80s ; the love of an heir long lost for the ward of a Wall Street " fox " ; the evil designs of two villains upon the fox 's fortunes ; the inevitable triumph of integrity . In the course of the fustian action , a locket is spirited from a painted backdrop bureau , hot villainous breath ruffles ostrich feathers on a period hat , a ticker tape registers cataclysmic unsteadiness in railroad stocks ; eight Fire Belles dance with breathless abandon , and two fire engines race to a fire . <P> The American Music Hall , now housing its fourth bumpkin melodrama , used to be a church . Last week it was revealed that twelve deceased ex-parishioners have left legacies to an edifice no longer sacred ; and the producers ' consciences have been pricked by quarterly donations from the American Bible Society . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flame as they have been with their previous ventures in the genre , Murder in the Old Red Barn and Naughty-Naught ( ' 00 ) , they will need no further alms . <P> Brother John , business head , and Brother Jerrold , literary partner , did research for their piece in the Museum of the City of New York , took as a pseudonym for Melodramatist Jerrold : John Van Antwerp Van Ostend . <P> The Music Hall 's audiences are seated at tables , served anything they think they can stand , usually continue their fun at a bar downstairs after the show . Though more sophisticated than Broadway cabaret crowds , they have made so much cheer- &-jeer; noise in the past that neighbors of the ex-church have complained . The Krimskys , on probation , must periodically pledge decorum to a deputy police commissioner . <P> To Quito and Back ( by Ben Hecht ; produced by the Theatre Guild , Inc . ) . Despite the undeniable flash and detonation of the salvo of Ben Hecht epigrams on love , social justice et al. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20th season last week , Manhattan play-goers found To Quito and Back largely a talkfest in the Andes , detected in Author Hecht 's author-hero an unhappy hesitance and uncertainty . <P> A breathtaking , gloriously pell-mell first scene packs the essential people of the play-the wife- &-world-fleeing; Alexander Sterns ( Leslie Banks ) , the other woman ( Sylvia Sidney ) , and a British consular official ( Francis Compton ) - out of a thronged Andean railway station and off for Quito by automobile in company with Zamiano ( Joseph Buloff ) , peasant leader of an anti-Fascist revolt . <P> Not long thereafter , however , the play bogs down under the weight of its own rhetoric at a villa outside Quito , where Sterns helps Zamiano direct his revolution while others at the villa plot against it . and Miss Sidney , in an anomalous position when Sterns 's wife fails to divorce him , beats frantically and ineffectually against the bars of circumstance . Sterns , brilliantly convincing to those about him , finally solves his own indecisions in a quixotic last act gesture , dying with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fascists .
