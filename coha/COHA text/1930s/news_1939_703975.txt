txt Both houses of the Legislature today passed and sent to the Governor the bill increasing the State tax on hard liquor from a dollar to $1.50 a gallon . The Governor 's office announced that he would sign the bill tonight . The bill will go into effect today and the liquors sold after today will be subject to the additional tax and presumably passed on to the consumer . However , there is an exemption of 250 gallons for stocks on hand . All stock over this amount is subject to a floor tax .
