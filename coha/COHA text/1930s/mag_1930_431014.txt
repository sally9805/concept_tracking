IN THE golden Klondike days the lonely 2,300 miles from Lake Bennett to Bering Sea became almost overnight the highway of adventurers from all nations . Now , thirty years later , inspiration armed me with a movie camera instead of a pick and sent me north to see for myself that famous old " Trail of 1898 . " A former shipmate , Fred Hill , enlisted as my companion . With a contract to film the annual migration of caribou across the Yukon , we dusted off our canoe , Song o ' the Winds , and shipped it with us from Seattle . The canoe , 1S feet long , spruceribbed , canvas-covered , and decked over on the bow , had already navigated the Snake and Columbia rivers . We launched our craft at Juneau in June and paddled north between snowy peaks of the Alexander Archipelago to Skagway . This sleepy town , resting in a low valley between glacier-edged mountains , hardly betrays the fact that once it was the popular jumping-off place to one of the most extravagant and sensational of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold-crazed Argonauts gave way to wide-eyed tourists , who look now for gold in sunsets and for walrus ivory carvings in the stores . Far from being adventurers ourselves , we soon found we had n't even sprouted pin feathers . Our new boots raised blisters as we ascended Chilkoot Pass from deserted Dyea , and the mosquitoes buzzed , They shall not pass . " We soon voted to abandon that route ! Yet some of the ninety-eighters , we are told , brought bicycles along with them to pedal their way to the Klondike ! TWO TENDERFEET HIT THE ARGONAUTS TRAIL OF ' ' 98 So in comfort we conquered the White Pass in a coach behind a puffy little engine that zigzagged to the summit of this coastal mountain barrier , where the Rockies slope into Canadian territory . Sea ozone was left behind , as we rattled down the eastern watershed . Here , beginning scarcely 15 miles from the Pacific , the first dribbling waters feeding the Yukon lakes are destined to travel 2,300 miles to reach Bering Sea . Thanks to the same lure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to travel with these waters ( see map , page 89 ) . While tourists besieged the lunch counter at Bennett , we carried our canoe from the flat car behind the cinder-spitting locomotive and launched it on Lake Bennett . Our cameras were set in iron racks on either side of the bow , while our clothes and provisions were packed in waterproof bags . One of these bags was marked " Miscellaneous ? if you ca n't find it , look in here . " Thus prepared , we mentally laid our first course : a thousand twisting miles to the northwest , above the Arctic Circle , to where , on the apex of the great Arctic bend at Fort Yukon , the river turns on a southwesterly trek for more than a thousand miles more to drop the sediment of its burdened waters upon a creeping delta . Adventurers ? We were cheechakos , limping in our new boots ! Thirty thousand Argonauts had hit this trail before us , and we merely followed in their wake , reading in a vague way their romantic saga , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranded steamboat hulks scattered along its banks all the way to St. Michael , on Bering Sea . Tourist cameras clicked as we waved good-bye , bowling down the lake before a southerly breeze . The skeleton of the old town of Bennett , where thousands of men once whipsawed lumber for their crude boats , faded away behind us . In mind I contrasted our lone canoe with that tumultuous traffic of thirty years before , when boats of every description crowded each other for rowing room . Snow still lingered on the granite-capped mountains rising abruptly on our left . Accompanying us overhead was that graceful marathon flyer , the Arctic tern , who spends his winters on the fringe of the Antarctic . Next morning we entered Tagish Lake beyond Bennett and skimmed at Carcross under a swinging bridge . A sloppy sea struck our beam as we nosed across the mouth of Fools Cove , among the breakers rolling in from Windy Arm . In summer the wind blows so strong at this place that the pine and spruce all lean to the  | northward . Below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvas and scudded us into Lake Marsh by sunset . Here the country became more open and the lowering ranges lost their blankets of snow . Ancient terraces along the right shore were bright with the magenta blossoms of the fireweed . Gulls and terns rose in alarm from little rock islands as we sailed by . A congenial Stick Indian ( so called because the tribe inhabits a region of small timber ) put out in his launch with a slab of moose meat and wanted to tow us down to the foot of the lake . He was animatedly proud of his chugging motor , bought with money made by trapping the winter before , and seemed rather disdainful of our ancient means of propulsion . His vanity was short-lived . As he described the speed of his motor and the merits of towing , a squall filled our sail and we raced away before the breeze , leaving our friend astern , trying to overtake us and shouting quotations on his moose meat ! Next morning we decided we could shoot the straight white combers through Miles Canyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrier three and a half miles below , convinced us with half a look that our sharp-prowed craft would be swallowed in the first comber . Here the whole river is funneled through a narrow rock channel , forming a mass of wild breakers succeeded by treacherous boils . Yet many men who ran these dangerous waters in old days had never handled a boat in their lives until they stopped at Lake Bennett to figure out which end of their oar went into the water ! Wooden portage trams on either side of the river saved the lives of many whose eagerness for Klondike gold might otherwise have sent them to doom in this maelstrom . We regretfully clipped the wings of adventure by portaging to the foot of Whitehorse . But anyone anticipating this joyride down the Yukon should not assume he has left the worst behind at Whitehorse . Open lower reaches , where the river  | sprawls into shallow inland seas and where one struggles against high winds and waves ? not for minutes but for days at a time ? still lie ahead and will amply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Whitehorse , at the foot of the rapid , is the terminus of the railroad and the head of navigation on the Yukon . Steamboats built during the gold rush , no longer useful in the decline of trade , rest on the ways here like shelved volumes of adventure . The Mounted Police , romantic knights of the north , made a note of our boat , and we again embarked , this time on a racing current that carried us to Lake Laberge . MAROONED TOR THREE DAYS We sailed down the west shore of the lake , which is rather swampy at the lower end . The east shore rises almost perpendicular , crowned with projections of conglomerates and slate , which form pillars , turrets , and domes of fantastic shapes . On small islands flocks of swallows were catching insects . Beyond Richthof en Island , rising prominently in the middle of this 3o-mile stretch of water , we had our last sail before a rising wind that grew to a violent mountain storm . In peril of swamping , we skirted the huge breakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the head of Thirtymile River , as the Lewes River is known from Lake Laberge to the mouth of the Teslin , we were driven into a shallow cove , and marooned for three days by breakers that battered the shore . I liked this camp . Unabating wind sang through our willow break . But the pleasure of eating wild strawberries and fishing for trout , which in early days were supplied to steamers by the ton , was clouded by the fear that we would be delayed and icebound before we could reach the Yukon 's mouth . " Spoke , " as Hill was nicknamed because he hailed from Spokane , even practiced carrying equipment up and down the beach to see how much he could handle , should we have to hike out . Our mosquito nuisance was abated a bit by the wind , provided we camped on open bars ,  | where it could blow them away ; but the huge black gnats were higher-powered and often came sailing into camp in a high wind to torment us until a fly-swatter put them out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at midnight , we threw our bags of equipment into the canoe and fought our way around a shallow point to the head of Thirtymile River . It proved the fastest stretch of water on the Yukon . Narrow and winding , it sometimes runs under high perpendicular banks of clay with crescent-shaped crowns of pine and spruce . Gulls fish on their private rocks at the head of eddies . It took us six hours to run to where the Teslin comes in and the two streams become the Lewes . On our left was the village of Hootalinqua , important in the early days as the place where the all-Canadian route by way of the Stikine and Teslin rivers joined the Skagway route . Some Indians on their way up the Teslin were camped here , all trying to get their motors started . As I stood up to photograph our first Indian encampment , a scowling chief ordered everyone into the tents . YUKON HOSPITALITY DISAPPEARED WITH THE PROSPECTOR The sun was warm as we coasted down the Lewes , over the Cassiar Bar , and through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decade or two before the rush started . At noon we  | passed the mouth of the Big Salmon . Like most tributaries of the upper Yukon , it is bordered by scenic ranges . Woodcutter cabins , whose occupants keep hungry steamboats supplied with cordwood , made the sweeping river less lonely . We wondered why we were n't invited more often to dinner , why the Yukon hospitality we had heard so much about was n't manifesting itself . Spoke 's explanation was that grub was too expensive to ship in and we looked too hungry . Now the prospector is gone and woodchoppers are little more than wage-earners . Some of them own a horse , but in the winter , when it is used to haul wood to the river , its upkeep on imported hay and grain would almost operate a yacht . Sometimes the men hailed us and we glided ashore , expecting to imbibe a cup of tea , only to be asked to deliver a letter to the camp below . Seventy miles below Hootalinqua we nosed into Little Salmon village , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach . A member of the Anglican mission here was aiding many natives stricken with influenza . It was a  | dismal camp . Its wreckage of a race , like a tattered page from the gold saga , revealed primitive man crushed almost to extermination by civilization . With the bold , reckless whites who swarmed into this wilderness came also a certain riffraff catering to the savage 's weakness for rum and debauching his women . Conscientious workers of Governwent and missions could do little against such odds to save these Indians from degeneracy . Now they are a scattered and forlorn race , merely existing from day to day in the slush along the white man 's frontier . Their colorful native costumes , observed by Frederick Schwatka on his rafting voyage down the Yukon in 1883 , have given place to the cheap , dingy  | clothes and calicoes of the white trader . The bright , intelligent faces that eagerly welcomed the white man have become sullen maps of wasting disease . We helped the missionary empty his salmon nets . These fish were ragged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry trip from Bering Sea . Such salmon have been found as far tip as Lake Bennett ; but their numbers diminish rapidly above Dawson , and are there no longer considered a staple article of native food . Hungry Malemutes slunk about the tent like sick wolves ; they took proffered salmon with indifferent grunts . Toward sundown squalls of wind and rain drove up the river . Lingering northern twilight brought ' deep silence . In the spot glow of a weird moon , three Indians floated downstream on a raft . Hunched over like huge bullfrogs , they seemed to symbolize the passing of their race on a death trail to shadowland . Indians who can not afford an outboard motor hike upstream and float down on logs . Brown ranges crowded in on the river as we approached Five-finger Rapid be- low the mouth of the Nordenskidld . Four rock towers , their tops fringed with stunted spruce , almost choke the river , forming five channels through which the c u r r e n t tears with great ve locity . A PHOTOGRAPHIC COMEDY OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the cliff to the foot of the rapid , and made a set-up looking upstream . Through the finder I could see the whitecaps leaping . Then I shouted for Spoke to make the descent . Suddenly I saw him just below me . He had come down the first channel while I had watched the second one ! Even the gulls and terns seemed to laugh at us . Five miles below here we descended Rink Rapid , piloting the canoe through the last roar we were to hear for a thousand miles . Next afternoon , below Hellsgate , among the Ingersoll Islands , luxuriant green vegetation and wild roses loaded the air with a heavy fragrance . Cruising among the islands , we sighted the great lava palisades of Pelly River Ramparts , where that stream , coming in from the east , joins the Lewes to form the Yukon proper . A moaning symphony of Malemute howls welcomed us at Selkirk , just below . Schwatka ( see text , page 94 ) described two of these dogs as having unusual pugnacity , fighting until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another to rest . Selkirk was formerly a Hudson 's Bay post and fort . It was built in the forties by Robert Campbell , who entered the Yukon Valley by way of the Liard and Pelly rivers . Warlike Chilkats from the coast destroyed it in 1853 because the fort had ousted them as intermediate traders with the interior Indians . During the gold rush Selkirk revived . To-day it serves as a trading post for the Indian and white trappers from the Pelly and Macmillan districts . When we left Selkirk we entered what Schwatka described as the Upper Ramparts . They extend almost to Circle . Indian campfires blazed in twilight down the river , and on the night wind drifted odors of smoking caribou meat . We heard at  | Selkirk that the main caribou herd had passed , but that stragglers were still crossing the river . By the time we made our next camp the lava bluff rampart that runs down the right wall from the mouth of the Pelly had been replaced by encroaching mountains . It was late by the time we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but for a long while I lay on the sand and watched the evening star rising up the canyon . CARIBOU TRAILS ABOUND Spoke 's desire for a caribou steak was almost gratified here when a herd came through camp at dawn . They were the first large wild animals I had ever seen outside of a zoo . I fired wildly and pursued them across the river in the canoe : but they were powerful swimmers and scrambled to the top of the bank , then looked back before disappearing into the brush . At Isaac Creek we found why no one may ever have followed a caribou migration . We mistook a herd of them in the river for geese ! They were swimming in close formation and finally reached an island . We followed them with the movie camera for a short distance through the brush , but clouds of mosquitoes made us forget all about the animals . With  | slapping hats we ran back to the canoe to soothe our wounds in the coolness of the river . All day we observed caribou trails ribbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bar and shoot down the winter 's supply of meat for the village right on the spot . At Britannia Creek two prospectors said that several thousand caribou had crossed to the east the week before . They described the calves as frolicking like longlegged dogs ( see pages 98 , Too ) . These men had broken their only watch and had constructed in front of their cabin a wooden sundial , which they said was not very effective when the sun shone almost 20 hours a day . While we were looking for a bar with driftwood for camp , we got the only goose we had to eat on the whole voyage . An eagle swooped across our bow and landed among a half-dozen young geese , who made the water ? all but one , and he stayed with the eagle . Our harmless method of firing at game and missing it alarmed the eagle ; he released the goose , which ran down and fell into the water , where we picked him up without slackening our speed . From his mountain peak the eagle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of his labors . The only place we ever grounded was on the Kirkman Creek Bar , which had held seven steamers fast at one time in the fall of 1903 . One of the steamers , the Canadian , now rotting at Whitehorse , had to remain there all winter . We struggled across the mud for almost an hour . " SPOKE " CHASES A CARIBOU Spoke and I shot our first caribou down below Kirkman Creek . After that , what with poor marksmanship and benevolent dispositions , we did n't harm another animal on the Yukon . This one was a lone buck swimming the river , and Spoke puffed at the oars before we overtook him . I missed him every time I fired , as he splashed in the shallows . Spoke told me to stop ; that I was wasting shells , and that he would run him down with his knife . A few moments after Spoke and the caribou had disappeared over the hill , Spoke shouted back , " He 's fainted . " Sure enough , the animal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bullet hole in him that we could find . Spoke contended that the only time the caribou was n't afraid was when I was firing at him , and that he died of fright when Spoke took after him with the knife . That evening we camped on a rocky beach with a French Canadian , Fortier. who was returning from a four years ' trapping expedition on the upper reaches of the White River . He was poling upstream to Jim Derry 's trading post at Coffee Creek to sell his outfit and dogs . so he could go " outside " and cure his rheumatism . He was a volcano of pent-up experiences . He talked all night with only two hours ' rest , and shouted the end of a yarn after us as we rounded the bend next morning . He said he kept the Indians off his trapping grounds by planting wolf bait and making them think it was poisoned . To save their dogs , they avoided his territory . Coffee Jack , an Indian gifted with grim humor , had replied to Fortier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mounted Police that he had mistaken him for a moose . Below Thistle Creek we passed the mouth of the White River , whose milky waters rise in the glacial beds of the St. Elias Range and muddy the Yukon so that it never again regains its green clearness . When we saw the White thus discoloring our drinking fountain , we grew thirsty and looked for clear ribbons of water to fill our jug . Soon the ranges fencing the Stewart River valley appeared over the spruce tops and on a bend ahead the white buildings of Stewart flashed in the sun . On summer 's breeze came a certain wonderment of what adventure awaited there . Stewart River was known for its goldpaying bars ten years before the Klondike was discovered . In 1884 news that two men had made 83,000 brought many stampeders into the country and the first general prospecting for placer gold began . To-day the Mayo mine , near the headwaters of the Stewart , is the hope of the Yukon Territory and its lead-silver ore forms the bulk of the freight on the Yukon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a chain of rock bluffs , with the gold of sunset dancing on channels between the islands . Passing a herd of caribou next clay ? and a mother black bear with two cubs ? Moosehide Mountain loomed behind Dawson ; we nosed into the bank below the noisy waters of historic Klondike River . Here the miner and his pick have been replaced by mammoth bucket dredges ( see page 106 ) . DAWSON IS STILL , THE METROPOLIS OF THE KLONDIKE/ Once the boardwalks of Dawson shook under the tread of 10,000 people . Today , still the metropolis of the Klondike , Dawson has been left , from shrinkage of population . to resemble a big empty show tent with most of the lights out . For three days we camped on the beach with an old character , " Sourdough " Smith , making experiments in flavoring beans with red peppers ( see page lot ) . We dropped downstream below Dawson in a drenching mist . Fish wheels . useless in the clear water above the White , now appeared along the banks , usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy air we took pains to photograph the first wheel , little suspecting that we should hear them creaking industriously all the way to tidewater.  | These wheels were invented on the Fairbanks stampede , some 28 years ago , and quickly spread to all muddy glacial streams where fish can not see the scoop ( page 116 ) . While eating a lunch of corned beef and sea biscuits , we drifted by the site of Fort Reliance , 7 miles below Dawson . When Schwatka s a w it , it had just been abancloned by famous Jack McQuesten ( called by him " McQuestion " ) , of the Alaska Commercial Company . He left , the Indians explained , because he was sick , but McQuesten explained that he was sick of the Indians . Several ugly-tempered medicine men had threatened to kill him for interfering with their drug business . Below Klondike River the Yukon narrows between chains of striking yellow bluffs extending down t o Fortymile . This place , once a strategic spot on t he Valdez Trail , is to-day yawning sleepily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Yukon Territory into Alaska . The boundary is marked by a lonely cabin and belt of cut timber running over the river ranges . All day we had been chased by a black cloud that gave us a deluge of Canadian wind and rain in American territory , just as we were trying to drift down on some sleeping caribou . They lay stretched out as though they were dead and raised their heads only to gaze curiously at us when our splashing paddles awakened them . Through a soft falling mist the 25 log cabins of Eagle Indian village appeared  | irresponsive , and sometimes arrogant . At home he is distinctly an individual . cordial. affectionate , often sensitive and proud . His appreciation was always great when we gave him tobacco . Nearly all men , women , and older children use it . The Government school has so impressed these natives with the need for cleanliness that the whole village will criticize one who does not keep his yard clean . This is not easy , as each family has children , dogs , woodpile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order . Below Eagle we voyaged under a drizzling rain all the way to Circle . Caribou were swimming the river in small bands , and it kept us busy running them down to get close enough for pictures . By cutting in ahead of them , just before they reached the shore , we could photograph them swimming ' the river two or three times . As they reached the shallows they set up a great splashing . The caribou are curious , and they seem to mistake objects even when they are close to them . The old-timers s a y they are nearsighted . We landed below the Tatonduk River to photograph 30 caribou standing on the bar . I got within 5o feet of them , only to find the camera had jammed . As I ran back to the canoe to change the film , I heard the thud of hoofs behind me and found the entire herd chasing me up the bar . When I stopped , they stopped too and blinked their eyes . Spoke said that it should take the conceit out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed black bear , ravens. and gulls feeding on carcasses of caribou drowned while swimming the river . At Charley Creek ( the local name for Kandik River ) an old sourdough who ran a summer dog camp said that he had found as many as four caribou at one time drowned in his fish wheel . His eyes twinkled when we told him about the eagle killing the goose ( see , also , text , page 104 ) .  | Seeing the Yukon through the eyes of tenderfeet , we had a wholesome respect for old-timers like this one . He made us feel like a small boy with his first air gun . There was a charm of shyness and native simplicity in his half-breed children , dressed in their bibbed overalls . The sixty odd dogs staked along the bank , which we regarded as savage Malemutes , the children handled like toy poodles , as we took their pictures . Their summer home consisted of one cabin , with bunks slung along the walls to fit the length of each child . Next day we stopped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i n mining days . In warming ourselves at the roadhouse after a morning of chilling fog , the conversation was monopolized by a trapper from Charley River . who had made a study of the mosquito . He recalled , or pretended to , an article in some past NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE which had stated that only the female bites . He said he knew better . Spoke and I were drawn to his views . but thought he should include the mosquito children . Late in the evening we stopped at a high bluff on the right . where two men were digging into a slide . searching for a phantom mine . The original discoverer had forgotten its location . but had floated down the river searching for it every summer for 20 years , until he died of old age . T h e s e were the only operations we saw actually on the river . Caribou were crossing the river all next day , as we neared the Yukon Flats . A summer hailstorm spattered our faces as we paddled into Circle , accompanied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so small that he seemed to be bulging over its sides . We pitched our tent on the bank , watched with interest by some Indian girls , who immediately began to pepper it with mud . Circle was founded in the early nineties , when gold was discovered on Mastodon Creek . Soon it boasted that it was  | the largest log-cabin village in the world . When it was deserted , in the Klondike stampede , many of these cabins were consumed as firewood . As in most Yukon villages , the majority of the fifty-odd natives are tubercular , h a v e detective eyesight or hearing , and are otherwise diseased . After midnight we were awakened by a booming voice and a swish of paddle wheels . We looked out to see a little short mate , with a giant voice , on the ore barge of the Yukon , bound for Nenana by way of Fort Yukon and Tanana . It gave me an idea . We would ride 85 miles through the miserable Yukon Flats to Fort Yukon . A word to the pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the caribou and we were northwardbound , with Song o ' the Winds aboard , when the Yukon sailed for Fort Yukon , on the great Arctic Bend . Dawn found us traversing t h e great network of islands through the Yukon Flats , where the Yukon is spread out to a width of lo to 20 miles . Ranges on both sides veer away from the river . To the left a series of isolated peaks are seen over the tops of high spruce trees on the islands . When we landed in Fort Yukon in the afternoon our steamer tied up there and gave the river bank the lively appearance of a Mississippi levee town . Here is the largest Indian community on the Yukon . Its natives are recruited from derelictE and stragglers of various tribes on the Yukon and Porcupine . They squatted along the walks , with their stolid faces , and seemed to resent being beamed on by benevolent tourists who beamed as if they knew just how it felt to be an Indian . FUR IS KING AT FORT YUKON The mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort Yukon . It is the oldest English-speaking settlement on the river ; and , since Alexander Hunter Murray , of the Hudson 's Bay Company , founded it in 1847 , fur has been its king . Its supplies were once transported more  | than 4,00o miles from York Factory , on Hudson Bay , and more than three years were spent in making the trip . At this camp we had our only sleep above the Arctic Circle . A strong wind swooping upriver , ripping our tent , urged us to start our 1,000-mile westward trek for St. Michael . This wind , blowing against the currents sweeping out of the lower mouth of the Porcupine and the Chandalar , put us in heavy breakers ; but wherever possible , especially on the shallow bars , we hugged the shore . At noon we crouched miserably beneath dripping willow trees and ate a box of cereal wit h condensed milk . That night we camped on an island 5o miles below Fort Yukon , with a high wind pushing down the moss-rooted trees . Below Windy Island camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a mist resembling a mirage. which gave a dismal aspect to t h e landscape and kept our feet cold . Broken fish wheels and swamped boats at two fish camps we passed testified that the late storm had been most violent . At Beaver , 52 miles below Fort Yukon , we received our first hospitality from a native . a Point Barrow Eskimo woman . H e r people had come here from the north with a generous J a p a n e s e trader , after he had married one of their women . SPOKE , GROWS SUSPICIOUS We had n't hitherto encountered the fine hospitality that characterizes the Eskimo ; so when the woman gave us two heads of lettuce and an ample slice of salmon . Spoke grew suspicious . He set off uptown to solve the problem and presently returned with a knowing nod . " That woman has two daughters just our age . whom she has been trying to marry off . " he explained . We sniffed the joker ! Next morning , as we drifted past the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and repairing fish traps , showing the energy that distinguishes them from the rather indifferent activity of the Indian . In early days Eskimos were sought as river crews , be- cause they are good workers . Below Stevens village we left the flatlands and entered the well-defined gates of the Lower Ramparts . Here the river is funneled between brown rolling ranges formed by a series of closely connected peaks . About Rampart Rapid we found fish wheels more numerous , because of the swifter current of the river . We c o a s t e d down over a growling reef at twilight , with the smoke from the white-tented fish camps giving the whole scene a romantic atmosphere . An S-hour run below here , the river leaves its confinement to enter more open reaches below the mouth of the Tanana , its largest tributary wholly within Alaska . At first Tanana made an impressive appearance . Then we found the impressiveness came only from red-roofed buildings of abandoned bar - racks ? old Fort Gibbon , at the lower end of town . A dilapidated row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two miles above . Tanana is near the site of Nuklukavet , once neutral ground for the British and Russian traders with the Indians , and later the farthest inland post of the Alaska Commercial Company . Downstream from Tanana the river widens to such an extent that it seemed to put us out of touch with the shores . Spoke amused himself when he was n't at the oars by reading the home newspapers wrapped around the jelly jars we had received at Tanana . When we passed two fish wheels close together we would each select one and see who could catch the most fish as long as we were in sight of them . RUBY TURNS ITS BACK ON THE RIVER Late in the afternoon we stopped to interview an old Indian living on the bank in a mud-smeared tent and keeping two fish wheels running . He had a humorous slant on life and a knack for slang . He had cleaned 120 silver salmon since morning , he said , and was working for a mining grubstake . Unlike most Indians , he dried his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years .  | Scudding before a fresh northeast wind , we landed next day at the mining town of Ruby , about 170 miles below Tanana . I have never seen another such dilapidated town . Its buildings , huddling together on miry streets , their backs pointing to the river , give the town a squalid aspect . This is an unsuccessful departure from the Yukon tradition of having the first row of cabins facing the river . Ruby 's population dwindled with the exhaustion of the placers on Long Creek ( see page 119 ) . The bank was so muddy that there was no place to pitch our tent , so a woodchopper living in a houseboat Took us in as guests . He knew what it was , he said , to be short on change and hungry , because o n 1 y three months before he had come floating into Ruby from Fairbanks on two logs , with a nickel in his pocket ! The water front echoed to a dog chorus as the steamer Alice . pushing a barge . steamed in from Nenana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and helped hustle freight , so we could make films of steamboat traffic on the river . NULATO , OLDEST SETTLEMENT ON THE YUKON Later , with our canoe now on the Alice , we passed the bold , solitary bluff of Bishop Mountain , rising from desolate Koyukuk flats . Twelve miles b e 1 o w , at the mouth of the Koyukuk River , we turned south - southwest , on the last great loop of the Yukon before it spills through its many distributaries into Bering Sea . Tumbling out of bunks to work freight at Nulato , we saw the oldest settlement on the Yukon . A fort and trading post were built here in 1838 by the half-breed Malakoff , who ascended the Yukon from St. Michael , in the employ of the Russian Fur Company . Nulato still carries the bloody stain of that massacre by Koyukuks in 1851 , in which about loo Indians of another tribe  | and several whites were slain . First , a native village near by was fired , and Indians who tried to escape were shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the post . At Anvik , 190 miles below Nulato , coast Eskimos begin to mix with interior Indians , and a modification of language and customs follows . Here people are fish eaters , as are all the natives down to Bering Sea . Their menu is varied by little else than the spring and autumn waterfowl . Here scenery was not varied : Indian or white fish-camps , with their groaning wheels . at wide intervals , and an occasional woodpile awaiting the steamer were all that changed the regular aspect of the river . After we had helped pile 170 tons of freight on the beach at Holy Cross for the mission there and the mines on the Iditarod , the Alice sailed away . We were left on the beach . again to embark in Song o ' the Winds . Spoke , as he again , juggled a bannock , regretted that the Alice could not leave its galley and Chinese cook with us . September dawned with white mists on the Yukon and snow capped peaks standing away to the east , cold but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Driving rain and a widening river threatened our control of the canoe . Open reaches presented vistas like inland seas . On shallow weather shores , in nasty squalls , it was bad going , with seas slopping over the gunwales . Where possible , we ran down the more sheltered side channels to avoid the wind . Below Paimiut the scenery became magnificent , with rugged , barren , cloud-capped mountains ' rising from the right shore . In late afternoon we reached Russian Mission ( Ikogmut ) . Here the triple cross of the Russian Church rises behind tents and smokehouses that border the beach . It is the sole surviving witness to the rule of the tsars on the Yukon . A score of  | dogs staked on the beach , their eyes swollen by mosquito bites , howled as they burrowed into the mud for relief . We camped just above the town and were instantly besieged by two coughing , spitting natives in kayaks , anxious to sell us fish . We bought their grayling to be rid of them . Tuberculosis is common to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food out of doors help them to combat this disease . MATT , THE SOCIAL LION OE THE YUKON A raging upstream wind with heavy rain soon drove us into a cabin . The storm-lashed river roared like an angry sea . On the evening of the third day a native boy shouted excitedly into our cabin , " Kayak ! " Spoke and I raced for the river in time to see Song o ' the hinds capsize in the middle of the stream anc disappear in mountainous breakers . The storm had rolled our craft 200 feet dowr the bank and fed it to the hungry Yukon Left without means of transportation we hired a native boy to take us dowr the river to Marshall . Matt owned the only outboard motor in the village . Fearing this outboard motor artist might develop a temperamental streak , we followed him around , humoring his every whim . Matt , with the customary native foresight , left the village on our trip clothed in a blue cotton shirt that was soon soaked in the steady rain . Despite this carelessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a social lion on the river and an admirable person with whom to travel . The complicated relationship that exists between these natives had given him some blood connection in every village for three or four hundred miles . We would no sooner heave in sight of a village than Matt would announce that we were to have tea at his uncle 's tent . One is welcome among these people at any time or place , and the farther the traveler has come the more welcome he is . Matt had a mouth harp , on which he reeled off waltzes as the motor putted down the river . The older natives had no music except the big drums used at their dances , but the present generation is musically inclined and can play several  | instruments by ear , principally the mouth organ , guitar , and accordion . A child with no knowledge of reading can pick his favorite phonograph records out from hundreds of others . Matt told me the reason he had a motor was " to get to places fast . " One would think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the river , that every native is in a hurry to get somewhere . He will race to one place , stop a few moments , then , turning around , will speed right back , doing nothing at either end of his journey . But the motors are n't good investments for the native , because of upkeep and his natural inability to run them intelligently and efficiently . Although time seems to mean nothing here , every house has two clocks , sometimes more . One of these is usually an ornate affair , with cuckoo chimes , and occupies an important position over the cookstove . In a village of 25 dwellings , one may find many different kinds of time . We found fish wheels still operating , rounding off the summer 's fishing . When the season begins , about June 15 , just after the ice breaks and the salmon begin to run , the natives travel in large numbers from the winter or hunting villages to the summer or fishing villages . One summer village usually comprises the inhabitants of three or four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Yukon ; but they do not have gear strong enough to fish out in salt water . where the catch would be larger . Many do not keep what little gear they do possess in shape to catch the first run of salmon ; they waste too much time trying to get their motors started . At the fishing village , all hands work faithfully for the first week or ten days . During this time the young men will have tinkered their motors into starting . They will then spend the summer running up and down the river , visiting from one fish camp to another , while old men , women . and children catch a few of the many thousand salmon that annually run upstream . When the fishing season ends . about August 1 , a family may have tthree  | or four hundred pounds of poorly cured fish with which to pay the trader for gas used in the joyriding motor boat ! Besides this , they may have two or three straw bags or boxes filled with edible dry king salmon ? in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labors . They do not put up enough salmon to feed their dogs during the winter , but must depend upon the lamprey run and upon fish caught through the ice . The natives had little curiosity about where we had come from or where we were going ; usually our only visitors when we made camp were three or four of Matt 's uncles . These people think a white man can do anything , because he can get it out of books . At Akahamut , Matt took aboard a dog and a hunchback boy for companions . On account of a high wind , we were unable to depart before noon . I feared , with all our tea engagements with Matt 's uncles , we should not be able to reach Marshall by evening , but Matt assured me we would . One of his uncles was giving a dance for him there and he would have to be present . With a squall sweeping toward us , we headed down a long slough , and then into the river , which opened up like a vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spoke , the hunchback , and the dog burrowed under the canvas . I steered while Matt bailed out the water that squirted in between the planks , which were working almost like an accordion . When we reached another slough that led into Marshall , I felt more comfortable . Matt stayed with us all night , in a little cabin at Marshall , with plans for an early start home next day ; but he fell asleep reading a comic paper , and awoke next morning with the idea of finishing it so fresh in his mind that it startled us . He read an hour and a half and drank six cups of coffee ; so it was late afternoon before he stemmed the river current for home . Marshall , founded in 1913 , when gold was discovered on Wilson Creek , is the last gold city on the Yukon . It was here we saw a wise old native listening in on the American presidential election returns , coming in over a radio in the schoolhouse.  | It was so much Greek to him , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though agreeing with the loud-speaker . Next day he was in one of the local trading stores with a pair of glasses on his nose and with a paper of last year 's vintage turned upside down , apparently reading to the younger natives . There were great times outside , he said . Two big men , Mr. Hoover and Mr. Smith , were running for a big white house . Mr. Smith was the nearest to the big white house , but there were lots of people helping Mr. Hoover to run . After trying unsuccessfully to charter another boat , Spoke and I shipped as deckhands aboard the Northern Commercial Company boat Ensee for St. Michael . The ever-widening river carried us past the last of the spruce trees that had started with us on far-away Bennett . The delta country became covered with dense tundra moss , from which sprang a scrubby willow brush . At Andreaf ski ( which dates back to 1853 ) we felt the lift of the tide 129 miles from the sea and watched the last of the hills fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole village was destroyed by Russians from St. Michael , to avenge the death of two traders killed by natives . We saw here our last boneyard of ships on the Yukon , for this was their great wintering place on the lower river . The Yukon narrowed , as we ran into its sloughlike Apoon mouth . At Old Hamilton an Eskimo schooner was anchored , and some dogs were staked in the mud . By sunset we ran out of this dismal mouth to rest on a bar and await high tide in Pastol Bay . So this was Bering Sea ? this angry tumult of mud that our propeller stirred up at midnight when we plowed through a bar ! We set our course up past Point Romanof for St. Michael . Rounding the passage between Stuart and St. Michaels islands at dawn , we saw . strewing the desolate beach , the last remnants of a faded regime that had spanned almost a century . A Russian blockhouse facing seaward , with its rusted iron cannon , was the beginning ; a broken , weary fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the far reaches of the Yukon was the end . The " Trail of ' 98 " is gone , and Time turns his pages to write a new chapter .  |
