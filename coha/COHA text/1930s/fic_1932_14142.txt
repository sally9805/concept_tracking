SCENE : The studio apartment of MARION FROUDE in an old-fashioned studio building in West 57th St. , New York . A great , cavernous room expressing in its polyglot furnishings the artistic patois of the various landlords who have sublet this apartment to wandering tenants like MARION FROUDE . The styles range from medieval Florence to contemporary Grand Rapids ; on a movable raised platform in the center is a papal throne chair in red velvet and gold fringes . Not far from it is an ordinary American kitchen chair . The hanging lamp which sheds a mellow light over a French Empire sofa is filigreed copper Byzantine . Another and longer sofa across the room against the grand piano is in soft green velvet and has the gentility of a polite Park Avenue drawing room . Under the stairs , rear , which go up to MARION 'S bedroom , are stacks of her canvases . There is a quite fine wood carving of a Madonna which seems to be centuries old and in the wall spaces looking at audience are great , dim canvases  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent  --  of Sargent 's Lord Ribblesdale and Mme. X. Whether it is due to the amenable spirit of the present incumbent or because they are relaxed in the democracy of art , these oddments of the creative spirit do not suggest disharmony . The room is warm , musty , with restful shadows and limpid lights . The enormous leaded window on the right , though some of its members are patched and cracked , gleams in the descending twilight with an opalescent light ; even the copper cylinder of the fire extinguisher and its attendant axe , visible in the hall , seem to be not so much implements against calamity , as amusing museum-bits cherished from an earlier time . Every school is represented here except the modern . The studio has the mellowness of anachronism . There is a door upstage left leading to the kitchen and MINNIE 'S bedroom ; a door , center , under the stairs leads into hallway . A door on the stair landing , center , leads to MARION 'S bedroom . TIME : About five o'clock of an afternoon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous cigarette . He has the essential audacity which comes from having seen the worst happen , from having endured the keenest pain . He has the hardness of one who knows that he can be devastated by pity , the bitterness which comes from having seen , in early youth , justice thwarted and tears unavailing , the self-reliance which comes from having seen everything go in a disordered world save one stubborn , unyielding core of belief  --  at everything else he laughs , in this alone he trusts . He has the intensity of the fanatic and the carelessness of the vagabond . He goes to the door from the hall and calls . KURT Say , you , hello there  --  what 's your name ? MINNIE , MARION FROUDE 'S inseparable maid , a German woman of about fifty , comes in . She is indignant at being thus summarily summoned , and by a stranger. p. 3 MINNIE with dignity.My name iss Minnie , if you please . KURT What time did Miss Froude go out ? MINNIE About two o'clock . KURT It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't she ? MINNIE She said she vas coming home to tea and that iss all I know . KURT grimly.I know . She invited me to tea . Where did she go to lunch ? MINNIE acidly.That I do not know . KURT Did someone call for her or did she go out alone ? I have a reason for asking . MINNIE She went out alone . Any more questions ? KURT No . I see there 's no point in asking you questions . MINNIE Den vy do you ask dem ? The doorbell rings . MINNIE throws up her hands in despair . She goes out muttering : " Ach Gott . " KURT is rather amused at her . He lights another cigarette . . Sounds of vociferous greeting outside . " Ach mein lieber Herr Feydak " MELCHIOR FEYDAK , the Austrian composer , comes in . He is forty-five , tall , hook-nosed , thin-faced , a humorist with a rather sad face. p. 4 FEYDAK Nun , Minnie , und wo is die schlechte. ? 1 Nun schlechte ? Now , Minnie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him not to disclose their free-masonry in the presence of strangers . She is cautious . Not home yet , eh , Minnie ? Where is she ? Well  --  well . How do they say  --  gallivanting  --  I love that word  --  gallivanting as usual . Well , I 'll wait . It 's humiliating  --  but I 'll wait . Chilly ! Brr ! I do n't mind so much being cold in London or Vienna . I expect it . But I ca n't stand it in New York . He warms himself before fire . And who is this young man ? MINNIE shortly.Ich weiss nicht ! ' Er hat alle fnf Minuten gefragt wo Sie ist  --  1 Ichist , I do n't know . He 's been asking every five minutes where she it . She goes out . FEYDAK You 've offended Minnie , I can see that . KURT That 's just too bad ! FEYDAK We all tremble before Minnie . Been waiting long ? KURT Over half an hour ! FEYDAK Extraordinary thing  --  ever since I 've known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are two kinds of people in one 's life  --  people whom one keeps waiting  --  and the people for whom one waits . p. 5 KURT Is that an epigram ? FEYDAK Do you object to epigrams ? KURT with some pride.I despise epigrams . FEYDAK tolerantly sizing KURT up.Hm ! Friend of Miss Froude 's ? KURT Not at all . FEYDAK That at least is no cause for pride . KURT I just do n't happen to be , that 's all . FEYDAK I commiserate you . KURT I despise gallantry also . FEYDAK lightly.And I thought Americans were so sentimental . KURT And , together with other forms of glibness , I loathe generalization . FEYDAK drily.Young man , we have a great deal in common . KURT Also , there is a faint flavor of condescension in the way you say " young man " for which I do n't really care . FEYDAK delighted and encouraging him to go on.What about me do you like ? There must be something . p. 6 KURT If I were that kind your question would embarrass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you say that ? FEYDAK She always had a knack for picking up originals ! KURT You are under a misapprehension . Miss Froude did not pick me up . I picked her up . FEYDAK stares at him . This does shock him . I wrote Miss Froude a letter  --  a business-letter . She answered and gave me an appointment for four-thirty . It is now after five . She has taken a half-hour out of my life . FEYDAK I gather that fragment of time has great value . KURT She has shortened my life by thirty minutes . God , how I hate Bohemians ! FEYDAK innocently.Are you by any chance  --  an Evangelist ? KURT I am  --  for the moment  --  a businessman . I 'm not here to hold hands or drink tea . I 'm here on business . My presence here is a favor to Miss Froude and likely to bring her a handsome profit . FEYDAK Profit ! Ah ! That accounts for her being late . p. 7 KURT sceptically.You despise profit , I suppose ! Are you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your technique is entirely wasted on me . KURT Technique ! What are you talking about ? FEYDAK When I was a young man  --  before I achieved any sort of success  --  I was rude on principle . Deliberately rude and extravagantly bitter in order to make impression . When it is no longer necessary for you to wait around for people in order to do them favors you 'll mellow down , I assure you . KURT fiercely , he has been touched.You think so , do you ! That 's where you 're mistaken ! I 'm rude now . When I 'm successful I 'll be murderous ! FEYDAK genially.More power to you ! But I 've never seen it happen yet . Success is the great muffler ! Not an epigram , I hope . If it is  --  forgive me . A moment 's pause . KURT studies him while FEYDAK crosses to stove and warms his hands . KURT I know you from somewhere . It 's very tantalizing . FEYDAK I do n't think so . I have only just arrived in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure  --  I 've seen you somewhere . FEYDAK understanding the familiarity.Maybe you know Miss Froude 's portrait of me . KURT doubtfully.Yes  --  maybe that 's it may I ask ? FEYDAK Certainly . My name is Feydak . KURT The composer ? FEYDAK drily.Yes . KURT I thought he was dead . FEYDAK That is true . But I hope you wo n't tell anyone  --  for I am his ghost . KURT putting this down for Continental humor and genuinely contrite.Forgive me . FEYDAK But why ? KURT If you really are Feydak the composer  --  I have the most enormous admiration for you . I worship music above everything . FEYDAK slightly bored.Go on . KURT I read in the paper  --  you 're on your way to Hollywood . p. 9 FEYDAK Yes . I am on my way to Hollywood . KURT In the new state men like you wo n't have to prostitute themselves in Hollywood . FEYDAK Ah ! A Utopian ! KURT Yes . You use the word as a term of contempt . Why ? Every artist is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be so contemptuous of Utopians . FEYDAK with a charming smile.I am rather tired . Old-world , you would call it . KURT You can be anything you like . FEYDAK satirically.Thank you . KURT You 've written lovely music  --  I have a friend who plays every note of it . I did n't see your operetta when it was done here . I did n't have the price it was very badly done though , I heard . FEYDAK I must explain to you  --  you are under a misapprehension . KURT It was done here , was n't it ? FEYDAK Not about the operetta . You are under a misapprehension  --  about me . I am a composer  --  but I did n't write " Danubia . " That was my brother , Victor Feydak . You are right . He is dead . You are the first person I have met in New York who even suspected it . p. 10 KURT I 'm sorry . FEYDAK Not at all . I am flattered . At home our identities were never confused . Is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort , compensation for his death . KURT is embarrassed and uncomfortable . It is part of his essential insecurity ; he is only really at home in protest . He wants to get out . KURT I 'm sorry  --  I. FEYDAK easily.But why ? KURT I think I 'll leave a note for Miss Froude  --  get that girl in here , will you ? FEYDAK Let 's have some tea  --  she 's sure to be in any minute . KURT No , thanks . And you might tell her for me that if she wants to see me about the matter I wrote her about she can come to my office . MARION FROUDE comes in . She is one of those women the sight of whom on Fifth Ave. , where she has just been walking , causes foreigners to exclaim enthusiastically that American women are the most radiant in the world . She is tall , lithe , indomitably alive . Unlike KURT , the tears in things have warmed without scalding her ; she floats life like a dancer 's scarf in perpetual enjoyment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm so sorry ! FEYDAK coming toward her . I do n't believe a word of it ! She is overjoyed at seeing FEYDAK . She ca n't believe for a second that it is he . Then she flies into his arms . MARION Feydie ! Oh , Feydie , I 've been trying everywhere to reach you  --  I ca n't believe it . Feydie darling ! FEYDAK severely.Is this how you keep a business appointment , Miss Froude ? MARION How long have you waited ? If I 'd only known . Suddenly conscious that KURT had waited tooOh , I 'm sorry , Mr.  --  Mr.  --  ? KURT Kurt . Richard Kurt . MARION Oh , of course , Mr. Kurt . I say  --  could you possibly  --  would it be too much trouble  --  could you come back ? FEYDAK same tone.This young man is here on business . It is more important . I can wait . I 'll come back . MARION No , no , Feydie  --  no , no . I ca n't wait for that . I 'm sure Mr. KURT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't seen in ever so long . It is n't as if Mr. Kurt were a regular businessman . p. 12 FEYDAK amused.How do you know he is n't ? MARION breathless with excitement.I can tell . He 's not a bit like his letter . When I got your letter I was sure you were jowley and , you know  --  she makes a gesture  --  convex . I 'm sure , Feydie  --  whatever the business is  --  to KURT  --  you did say you had some , did n't you ?  --  I 'm sure it can wait . A half-hour anyway . Ca n't it wait a half-hour ? You see , Feydie and I have n't seen each other since . KURT Vienna ! MARION astonished.Yes . How did you know ? KURT It 's always since Vienna that Bohemians have n't seen each other , is n't it ? I 'll be back in thirty minutes . He goes . MARION What a singular young man ! FEYDAK I 've been having a very amusing talk with him . Professional rebel , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They take each other in . MARION Is n't it wonderful . FEYDAK It is nice ! They sit on sofa , MARION left of FEYDAK. p. 13 MARION How long is it ? FEYDAK Well , it 's since . MARION firmly.Since Vicki died . FEYDAK That 's right . I have n't seen you since . MARION Since that day  --  we walked behind him . FEYDAK Yes . MARION I felt I could n't bear to stay on . I left for London that night . FEYDAK Yes . MARION It 's six years , is n't it ? FEYDAK Yes . Six years last June . A pause MARION What 's happened since then ? Nothing . FEYDAK How long have you been here ? MARION Two weeks . FEYDAK Busy ? MARION Not professionally , I 'm afraid . People are charming  --  they ask me to lunch and dinner and they 're  --  " oh , so interested "  --  but no commissions so far . And God , how I need it . FEYDAK I 'm surprised . I gathered you 'd been very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , has n't it ? The impression , I believe , is due to the extreme notoriety of some of my sitters . Oh , I 've managed well enough up to now  --  if I 'd been more provident I dare say I could have put a tidy bit by  --  but at the moment people do n't seem in a mood to have their portraits done . Are they less vain than they used to be ? Or just poorer ? FEYDAK Both , I think . MARION Last time I came here I was awfully busy . Had great rclame because I 'd been in Russia doing leading Communists . Obeying some subtle paradox the big financiers flocked to me . Pittsburgh manufacturers wanted to be done by the same brush that had tackled Lenin . Now they seem less eager . Must be some reason , Feydie . But what about you ? Let me hear about you . How 's Kathie ? FEYDAK Well . She 's here with me . MARION And Sadye ? FEYDAK Splendid . MARION She must be a big girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kathie used to hate me , did n't she ? Frightened to death of me . Was afraid I was after Vicki 's money . FEYDAK Yes . She was afraid you 'd marry him and that we should have less from him . When we knew he was dying she was in a panic . p. 15 MARION Poor dear  --  I could have spared her all that worry if she 'd been halfway civil to me . FEYDAK Kathie is practical . And she is a good mother . Those are attributes which make women avaricious . MARION Did Vicki leave you very much ? FEYDAK Not very much . Half to you . MARION Really ? How sweet of him ! How dear of him ! FEYDAK We 've spent it . MARION Of course you should . FEYDAK But I 'll soon be in position to repay you your share . I 'm on my way to Hollywood . MARION Are you really ? How wonderful for you , Feydie ! I 'm so glad . FEYDAK You 've been there , have n't you ? MARION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you like it ? MARION Well , it 's the new Eldorado  --  art on the gold-rush . FEYDAK with a kind of ironic bitterness.Vicki left me an inheritance subject , it appears , to perpetual renewal . MARION How do you mean ? p. 16 FEYDAK Things have been going from bad to worse in Vienna  --  you have n't been there since ' 25 so you do n't know . The theatre 's pretty well dead  --  even the first-rate fellows have had a hard time making their way . I managed to get several scores to do  --  but they were not  --  except that they were failures  --  up to my usual standard . MARION laughing , reproachful.Oh , Feydie ! FEYDAK If it were n't for the money Vicki left me  --  and you !  --  I do n't know how we should have got through at all these six years . About a month ago we reached the end of our rope  --  we were hopelessly in debt  --  no means of getting out  --  when the miracle happened . MARION is excited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bear it . FEYDAK It was my dramatic agent on the phone . A great American film magnate was in town and wanted to see me . Ausgerechnet me and no other . Even my agent could n't keep the surprise out of his voice . Why me ? I asked . God knows , says the agent . Well , we went around to the Bristol to see the magnate . And , as we talked to him , it gradually became apparent . He thought I was Vicki . He did n't know Vicki was dead ! He thought I had written " Danubia. " p. 17 MARION Did he say so ? FEYDAK No  --  not at all . But as we shook hands at the end he said to me : " Any man that can write a tune like this is the kind of man we want . " And he whistled , so out of tune that I could hardly recognize it myself , the waltz from Danubia . Do you remember it ? He starts to hum the waltz and MARION joins him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as MARION continues to hum a few more measures . He was so innocent , so affable that I had an impulse to say to him : " Look here , old fellow , you do n't want me , you want my brother and , in order to get him , you 'll have to resurrect him ! " But noble impulses are luxury impulses . You have to be well off to gratify them . I kept quiet . We shook hands and here I am . Tonight they 're giving me a dinner at the Waldorf Astoria for the press to meet my brother ! Irony if you like , eh , Marion ? There is a pause . MARION Feydie A moment . He does not answer . Feydie  --  do you mind if I say something to you  --  very frankly ? FEYDAK I doubt whether you can say anything to me more penetrating than the remarks I habitually address to myself . MARION You know Vicki was very fond of you . He used to say you put too high a valuation on genius . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deprecate it . MARION Over and over again he used to say to me : " You know , Marion , " he would say , " as a human being Feydie 's far superior to me , more amiable , more witty , more talented , more patient . " FEYDAK shakes his head.Not true . I simply give the impression of these things . MARION You underrate yourself , Feydie . How this would have amused him  --  this incident with the Hollywood man ! FEYDAK smiling bitterly.It would rather . MARION &gt;Why do you grudge giving him a laugh somewhere ? I never had a chance to tell you in Vienna  --  things were so  --  so close and terrible  --  at the end  --  but he had the greatest tenderness for you . He used to speak of you  --  I ca n't tell you how much . " Because of this sixth sense for making tunes which I have and he has n't , " he said to me one day  --  not a week before he died  --  " he thinks himself less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had he owed to you  --  to the sacrifices you made to send him to the Conservatory when he was a boy . The extent to which he had outstripped you hurt him  --  hurt him . I felt he would have given anything to dip into the golden bowl of his genius and pour it over you . And do you know what was the terror of his life , the obsessing terror of his life ?  --  his fear of your resenting him . p. 19 FEYDAK moved , deeply ashamed.Marion . MARION Do n't resent him now , Feydie . Why , it 's such fun  --  do n't you see ? It 's such a curious , marginal survival for him  --  that a badly-remembered waltz-tune , five years after his death , should be the means of helping you at a moment when you need it so badly . It 's delicious , Feydie . It 's such fun ! The only awful thing is the possibility that he is unaware of it . It would have pleased him so , Feydie . Must you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MARION brightly.Nonsense . FEYDAK Because I did grudge him it  --  yes  --  I wo n't , though  --  I see now that it never occurred to me how Bursts out laughing suddenlyGod , it is funny , is n't it . MARION joining in his laughter.Of course  --  it 's delightful . They both laugh heartily and long . MARION And the funny thing is  --  you 'll be much better for them out there than he would have been . FEYDAK Surely ! They 'll be able to whistle my tunes ! p. 20 MARION Do n't you see ! FEYDAK Oh , Lieber Schatzel , 1 Lieber Schatzel , darling . come out there with me . MARION Ca n't . FEYDAK I wish , Marion , you would come . I never feel life so warm and good as when you are in the neighborhood . MARION Dear Feydie , you 're very comforting . FEYDAK Is there someone that keeps you here ? MARION No , there 's no one . I 'm quite alone . FEYDAK Well then ! MARION No , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't afford the journey . I 'm frightfully hard u hard up , a plant leading to Marion 's acceptance of Kurt 's offer soon after . at the moment . FEYDAK Well , look here , I MARION No , that 's sweet of you but I could n't . FEYDAK I do n't see why  --  it 's too silly . MARION Vanity . A kind of vanity . FEYDAK But I owe it to you ! MARION I suppose it is foolish in a way  --  but I 've a kind of pride in maneuvering on my own . I always have done it  --  in that way at least I 've been genuinely independent . I 'm a little proud of my ingenuity . And do you know , Feydie , no matter how hard up I 've been at different times something 's always turned up for me . I have a kind of curiosity to know what it will be this time . It would spoil the fun for me to take money from my friends . Nothing so much as that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  marketability ? p. 21 FEYDAK Paradoxical , is n't it ? MARION Why not ? Anyway , it 's a pet ide of mine , so be a darling and let me indulge it , will you , Feydie , and do n't offer me money . Anyway , I 've a business proposition on . FEYDAK Have you ? MARION That young man who was just here . Do you suppose he 'll come back ? Now I think of it we were a bit short with him , were n't we ? I was so glad to see you I could n't be bothered with him ! Sound of doorbellAh ! You see ! Calls outsideShow him in , Minnie ! MINNIE comes in and exits hall door to admit the visitor . FEYDAK What are you doing for dinner ? MARION There 's a young man who attached himself to me on the boat . FEYDAK Oh , Marion ! MARION I seem to attract youth , Feydie . What shall I do about it ? FEYDAK Where are you dining ? MARION I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll MINNIE ushers in Mr. LEANDER NOLAN . He is middle-aged , ample , handsome . Looks like the late Warren Gamaliel Harding.1 Warren Gamaliel Harding . The twenty-ninth president of the United States was a handsome middle-aged man , but otherwise undistinguished . Soberly dressed and wears a waistcoat with white piping on it . The faade is impeccable but in NOLAN 'S eye you may discern , at odd moments , an uncertainty , an almost boyish anxiety to please , to be right , that is rather engaging . MARION , who expected the young man , is rather startled . Mr. NOLAN regards her with satisfaction. p. 22 NOLAN Hello , Marion . MARION doubtfully , feels she should remember him.How do you do ? Er  --  will you excuse me  --  just a second ? NOLAN genially.Certainly . He moves right . MARION walks FEYDIE to the hall door . FEYDAK under his breath to her.Looks like a commission . She makes a gesture of silent prayer . MARION out loud.Telephone me in an hour , will you , Feydie , and let me know which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of NOLAN 'S hearing.Also , du kommst ganz sicher ? 1 Also sicher ? So you 'll come for sure ? MARION Vielleicht spter.2 Vielleicht spter , maybe later . ' Bye , Feydie dear . FEYDIE goes out . MARION turns to face NOLAN who is standing with his arms behind his back rather enjoying the surprise he is about to give her . NOLAN How are you , Marion ? p. 23 MARION delicately.Er  --  do I know you ? NOLAN Yes . You know me . MARION Oh , yes  --  of course ! NOLAN About time ! MARION brightly insecure.Lady Winchester 's garden-party at Ascot  --  two summers ago . NOLAN Guess again ! MARION No  --  I know you perfectly well  --  it 's just that  --  no , do n't tell me . She covers her eyes with her hand , trying to conjure him out of the past . NOLAN This is astonishing . If someone had said to me that I could walk into a room in front of Marion Froude and she not know me I 'd have told ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know you perfectly well  --  it 's just that NOLAN You 'll be awful sore at yourself  --  I warn you MARION I ca n't forgive myself now  --  I know ! NOLAN I do n't believe it ! MARION The American Embassy dinner in Rome on the Fourth of July  --  last year  --  you sat on my right . p. 24 NOLAN I did not ! MARION miserably.Well , you sat somewhere . Where did you sit ? NOLAN I was n't there . MARION Well , I think it 's very unkind of you to keep me in suspense like this . I ca n't bear it another second ! NOLAN I would n't have believed it ! MARION Well , give me some hint , will you ? NOLAN Think of home  --  think of Tennessee ! MARION Oh ! NOLAN Little Mary Froude . MARION a light breaking in on her. No ! Oh , no ! NOLAN Well , it 's about time . MARION But ! You were NOLAN Well , so were you ! MARION But  --  Bunny  --  you are n't Bunny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOLAN I have no brother . MARION But Bunny  --  Bunny dear  --  how important you 've become ! NOLAN I have n't done badly  --  no. p. 25 MARION Here , give me your coat and hat  --  MARION , taking his coat and hat , crosses upstage to piano , and leaves them there . Laughing , a little hystericalYou should have warned me . It 's not fair of you . Bunny ! Of all people  --  I can scarcely believe it . A moment 's pause . He does n't quite like her calling him Bunny but he does n't know how to stop it . She sits on model stand looking up at him as she saysYou look wonderful . You look like a  --  like a  --  Senator or something monumental like that . NOLAN sits on sofa below piano.That 's a good omen . I 'll have to tell Orrin . MARION What 's a good omen ? And who is Orrin ? NOLAN Your saying I look like a Senator . Because  --  I do n't want to be premature  --  but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator ! NOLAN smiling.Senator . Washington . Not Nashville . MARION Do you want to be a Senator or ca n't you help it ? NOLAN to whom this point of view is incomprehensible.What do you mean ? MARION I 'll paint you , Bunny . Toga . Ferrule . Tribune of the people . p. 26 NOLAN Not a bad idea . Not a bad idea at all . I remember now  --  you were always sketching me . Sketching everything . Say , you 've done pretty well yourself , have n't you ? MARION Not as well as you have , Bunny . Imagine . Bunny Nolan  --  a Senator at Washington . Well , well ! And tell me  --  how do I seem to you ? You knew me at once , did n't you ? NOLAN Sure I did . You have n't changed so much  --  a little , perhaps . MARION delicately.Ampler ? NOLAN inspecting her. No not that I can notice . MARION with a sigh of relief.That 's wonderful . NOLAN You look just the same . You are just the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm artful . How long is it since we 've seen each other ? Twelve years anyway . More than that  --  fifteen NOLAN Just about  --  had n't even begun to practice law yet . MARION We were just kids children . And now look at you ! I can see how successful you are , Bunny . p. 27 NOLAN How ? MARION White piping on your vest . That suggests directorates to me . Multiple control . Vertical corporations . Are you vertical or horizontal , Bunny ? NOLAN I 'm both . MARION Good for you ! Married ? NOLAN Not yet MARION How did you escape ? You 're going to be , though . NOLAN I 'm engaged . MARION Who 's the lucky girl ? NOLAN Slade Kinnicott . Daughter of Orrin Kinnicott . MARION Orrin Kinnicott . The newspaper publisher ? NOLAN Yes . He 's backing me for the Senate . MARION Well , if he 's backing you you ought to get in . All that circulation  --  not very good circulation , is it ? Still , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOLAN hurt.In my own State the Kinnicott papers are as good as any MARION Well , I wish you luck . I 'm sure you 'll have it . My ! Senator Nolan ! NOLAN If I get in I 'll be the youngest Senator p. 28 MARION And the best-looking too , Bunny NOLAN embarrassed.Well MARION You 're fussed ! How charming of you ! She sits beside him . Oh , Bunny , I 'm very proud of you , really . NOLAN You see , Marion , I 've been pretty successful in the law . Tremendously successful , I may say . I 've organized some of the biggest mergers of recent years . I 've made a fortune  --  a sizeable fortune . Well , one day I woke up and I said to myself : Look here , Nolan , you 've got to take stock . You 've got to ask yourself where you 're heading . I 'd been so busy I 'd never had a chance to ask myself these fundamental questions before . And I decided to call a halt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I said to myself . It 's time you quit piling up money for yourself and began thinking about your fellow-man . I 've always been ambitious , Marion . You know that . You shared all my early dreams MARION Of course I did . NOLAN Remember I always told you I did n't want money and power for their own sakes  --  I always wanted to be a big man in a real sense  --  to do something for my country and my time MARION Yes . Sometimes you sounded like Daniel Webster , darling . I 'm not a bit surprised you 're going in the Senate . p. 29 NOLAN I never thought  --  even in my wildest dreams . MARION Well , you see you underestimated yourself . You may go even higher  --  the White House  --  why not ? NOLAN I never let myself think of that . MARION Why not ? It 's no more wonderful than what 's happened already , is it ? NOLAN Napoleon at Saint Helena.Destiny ! MARION Exactly . Destiny ! NOLAN kind , richly human , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Obscure . Uncertain . Alone . Nowhere at all . Not the remotest chance of my getting into the Senate  --  unless I marry into it . Oh , Bunny , after you get to Washington will you introduce me to some Senators ? NOLAN Well , that 's premature Naturally if the people should favor me I 'd do what I could . I never forget a friend . Whatever faults I may have , disloyalty , I hope , is not one of them . MARION Of course it is n't . You 're a dear . You always were . A moment 's pause . NOLAN Who was that fellow I found you with when I came in ? p. 30 MARION An old friend of mine from Vienna  --  a composer . NOLAN You 've been a lot with foreigners , have n't you ? MARION A good deal NOLAN Funny , I do n't understand that . MARION Foreigners are people , you know , Bunny . Some of ' em are rather nice . NOLAN When I 'm abroad a few weeks home begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York but I ca n't say I feel an acute nostalgia for Tennessee . Another pause . He stares at her suddenly  --  still incredulous that he should be seeing her at all , and that , after all these years and quite without him , she should be radiant still . NOLAN Little Marion Froude ! I ca n't believe it somehow . MARION Oh , Bunny ! You 're sweet ! You 're so  --  ingenuous . That 's what I always liked about you . NOLAN What do you mean ? MARION The way you look at me , the incredulity , the surprise . What did you expect to see ? A hulk , a remnant , a whitened sepulchre what ? NOLAN uncomfortable at being caught.Not  --  not at all . p. 31 MARION Tell me , Bunny , what ? I wo n't be hurt NOLAN miserably , stumbling.Well , naturally , after what I 'd heard MARION What have you heard ? Oh , do tell me , Bunny . NOLAN Well , I mean  --  about your life . MARION Racy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You chose your own way . Everybody has a right to live their own life , I guess . MARION pats his arm.That 's very handsome of you Bunny . I hope you take that liberal point of view when you reach the Senate . NOLAN I came here , Marion , in a perfectly sincere mood , to say something to you , something that 's been on my mind ever since we parted , but if you 're going to be flippant I suppose there 's no use my saying anything  --  I might as well go , in fact . But he makes no attempt to do so . MARION seriously.Do forgive me , Bunny . One gets into an idiom that passes for banter but really I 'm not so changed . I 'm not flippant . I 'm awfully glad to see you , Bunny . An undertone of sadness creeps into her voice . After all , one makes very few real friends in life  --  and you are part of my youth  --  we are part of each other 's youth p. 32 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise ! After all I 've been in New York many times during these years and never once  --  never once have you come near me . You 've dropped me all these years . With a sighI 'm afraid , Bunny , your career has been too much with you . NOLAN grimly.So has yours ! MARION I detect an overtone  --  faint but unmistakable  --  of moral censure . NOLAN same tone.Well , I suppose it 's impossible to live one 's life in art without being sexually promiscuous ! He looks at her accusingly . MARION Oh , dear me , Bunny ! What shall I do ? Shall I blush ? Shall I hang my head in shame ? What shall I do ? How does one react in the face of an appalling accusation of this sort ? I did n't know the news had got around so widely NOLAN Well , so many of your lovers have been famous men . MARION Well , you were obscure But you 're famous now , are n't you ? I seem to be stimulating if nothing else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have now you probably would n't have walked out on me at the last minute the way you did p. 33 MARION Dear , dear Bunny , that 's not quite  --  NOLAN irritated beyond control.I wish you would n't call me Bunny . MARION Well , I always did . What is your real name ? NOLAN You know perfectly well MARION I swear I do n't . NOLAN My name is Leander . MARION Bunny , really . NOLAN That is my name . MARION Really I 'd forgotten that . Leander ! 1 Leander . According to the Greek myth the handsome youth Leander swam the Hellespont by night to see his beloved Hero on the opposite shore . Who was he  --  he did something in the Hellespont , did n't he ? What did he do in the Hellespont ? NOLAN sharply.Beside the point . MARION Sorry ! You say you wanted to tell me something  --  NOLAN grimly.Yes ! MARION I love to be told things . NOLAN That night you left me  --  p. 34 MARION We 'd quarrelled about something , had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much I 'd grown to depend on you  --  MARION Dear Bunny ! NOLAN I plunged into work . I worked fiercely to forget you . I did forget you  --  He looks away from her . And yet  --  MARION And yet  --  ? NOLAN The way we 'd separated and I never heard from you  --  it left something bitter in my mind  --  something  --  He hesitates for a word . MARION supplying it.Unresolved ? NOLAN Quickly  --  relieved that she understands so exactly.Yes . All these years I 've wanted to see you , to get it off my mind  --  MARION Did you want the last word , Bunny dear ? NOLAN fiercely.I wanted to see you , to stand before you , to tell myself  --  " Here she is and  --  and what of it ! " MARION Well , can you ? NOLAN heatedly , with transparent overemphasis.Yes ! Yes ! p. 35 MARION Good for you , Bunny . I know just how you feel  --  like having a tooth out , is n't it ? SincerelyIn justice to myself  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on you in the summary way I did was not , as you 've just suggested , because I doubted your future  --  it was obvious to me , even then , that you were destined for mighty things  --  but the reason was that I felt a disparity in our characters not conducive to matrimonial contentment . You see how right I was . I suspected in myself a  --  a tendency to explore , a spiritual and physical wanderlust  --  that I knew would horrify you once you found it out . It horrifies you now when we are no longer anything to each other . Imagine , Leander dear , if we were married how much more difficult it would be  --  If there is any one thing you have to be grateful to me for it is that instant 's clear vision I had which made me see , which made me look ahead , which made me tear myself away from you . Why , everything you have now  --  your future , your prospects  --  even your fiance , Leander dear  --  you owe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me  --  to that instinct  --  to that premonition . NOLAN nostalgic.We might have done it together . MARION I would n't have stood for a fiance , Bunny dear  --  not even I am as promiscuous as that . p. 36 NOLAN Do n't use that word ! MARION But , Leander ! It 's your own ! NOLAN Do you think it has n't been on my conscience ever since , do you think it has n't tortured me ! MARION What , dear ? NOLAN That thought ! MARION Which thought ? NOLAN Every time I heard about you  --  all the notoriety that 's attended you in the American papers painting pictures of Communist statesmen , running around California with movie comedians ! MARION I have to practice my profession , Bunny . One must live , you know . Besides , I 've done Capitalist statesmen too . And at Geneva . NOLAN darkly.You know what I mean ! MARION You mean  --  she whispers through her cupped hand  --  you mean promiscuous ? Has that gotten around , Bunny ? Is it whispered in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witch if I go back home ? Will they have a trial over me ? Will you defend me ? NOLAN quite literally , with sincere and disarming simplicity.I should be forced , as an honest man , to stand before the multitude and say : In condemning this woman you are condemning me who am asking your suffrages to represent you . For it was I with whom this woman first sinned before God . As an honorable man that is what I should have to do . p. 37 MARION And has this worried you  --  actually ! NOLAN It 's tortured me ! MARION You 're the holy man and I 'm Thais ! That gives me an idea for the portrait which I hope you will commission me to do . I 'll do you in a hair-shirt . Savonarola . He was a Senator too , was n't he ? Or was he ? NOLAN gloomily contemplating her . I ca n't forget that it was I who MARION Did you think you were the first , Bunny ? Was I so unscrupulously coquettish as to lead you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been . It 's not like me . She crosses to right of model stand . NOLAN fiercely.Do n't lie to me ! MARION sitting on stand.Bunny , you frighten me ! NOLAN stands over her almost threateningly.You 're lying to me to salve my conscience but I wo n't have it ! I know my guilt and I 'm going to bear it ! MARION Well , I do n't want to deprive you of your little pleasures but NOLAN You 're evil , Marion . You have n't the face of evil but you 're evil  --  evil ! p. 38 MARION Oh , Bunny darling , now you ca n't mean that surely . What 's come over you ? You never were like that  --  or were you ? You know perfectly well I 'm not evil . Casual  --  maybe  --  but not evil . Good Heavens , Bunny , I might as well say you 're evil because you 're intolerant . These are differences in temperament , that 's all  --  charming differences in temperament . NOLAN shakes his head , unconvinced.Sophistry ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way I 've met the Gloomy Dean and he 's not gloomy at all  --  he 's very jolly . Gets up from standLet 's have a cup of tea , shall we ? Will your constituents care if you have a cup of tea with a promiscuous woman ? Will they have to know ? NOLAN I 'm afraid I ca n't , Marion . I have to be getting on . MARION Oh , stay and have some tea  --  Makes him sit downWhat do you have to do that ca n't wait for a cup of tea ? Calls offMinnie  --  Minnie . MINNIE appears in doorway.Ja , Frulein . MARION Bitte  --  Thee . p. 39 MINNIE Ja , Frulein . She goes out . MARION smiles at NOLAN and sits beside him . He is quite uncomfortable . NOLAN slightly embarrassed.About the painting , Marion . MARION Oh , I was only joking do n't let yourself be bullied into it NOLAN I 've never been painted in oils . It might do for campaign purposes . And , if I should be elected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARION You 're awfully kind , Bunny . I must tell you frankly though that the dignified Senatorial style is n't exactly my forte . However , I might try . Yes  --  I 'll try She gives him a long look . I 'll go the limit on you , Bunny  --  when I get through with you you 'll be a symbol of Dignity . Solid man . No nonsense . Safe and sane . Holds the middle course  --  a slogan in a frock-coat . I 'll make you look like Warren G. Harding  --  even handsomer  --  Get you the women 's votes . NOLAN Well , that 'll be very nice of you . MARION suddenly kisses him . MARION Thank you , darling ! He is very uncomfortable , embarrassed and thrilled. p. 40 NOLAN Marion ! MARION Just a rush of feeling , dear ! NOLAN You understand that this  --  this commission MARION Of course . Strictly business . Do n't worry . I sha n't kiss you again till it 's finished . NOLAN I do n't know whether I told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MARION I 'll have the portrait ready for your wedding-day . NOLAN And I am devoted to Slade with ever fibre of my being . MARION Every fibre  --  how thorough ! NOLAN I 'm not a Bohemian , you know , Marion . MARION Do n't tell me ! You 're a gypsy ! She continues to study him , poses him , poses his hand : MINNIE enters from left with tea tray containing teapot , cups and saucers , spoons , sugar and cream , and a plate of cakes . She puts tray on model stand and exits left . Oh , Bunny , what fun it 'll be to do you . Thank you , Minnie . Tell me  --  how do you see yourself ? NOLAN What do you mean ? MARION In your heart of hearts  --  how do you see yourself ? Napoleon , Scipio , Mussolini ? p. 41 NOLAN Nonsense ! Do you think I 'm an actor ? MARION Of course . Everybody is . Everybody has some secret vision of himself . Do you know what mine is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorbell rings . NOLAN ironically.More visitors ! MARION calls to MINNIE.See who it is , will you , Minnie ? Probably the young man I met on the boat coming to take me to dinner . NOLAN What 's his name ? MARION I 've forgotten . He 's just a boy I met on the boat . NOLAN How can anybody live the way you live ? MARION It 's a special talent , dear . Doorbell rings again . Minnie , go to the door . MINNIE comes in and exits hallway . This is my lucky day , Bunny . NOLAN Would you mind , in front of strangers , not calling me Bunny ? MARION Oh , of course , what is it ? NOLAN irritated.Leander . MARION mnemonic.Leander  --  Hellespont  --  Leander . MINNIE comes downstage a few feet from the door. p. 42 MINNIE just inside the room.It 's the Junge who was here before  --  er sagt er ist ausgeschifft da  --  MARION Oh , show him in , Minnie , and bring a cup for him too . MINNIE as she goes.Ja . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  anybody who did n't know you would misunderstand it . MARION very happy.All right , darling . MINNIE ushers in RICHARD KURT , goes out , comes back again with more tea . MARION comes forward to greet him . I 'm so glad to see you again , Mr.  --  KURT Kurt . MARION Oh . KURT With a K. MARION reassured.Oh  --  I 'll try to remember . This is Senator Nolan  --  Mr. Kurt . NOLAN glowering.I am not Senator Nolan . MARION But you will be . She offers him a cup of tea , he takes it . Ca n't I just call you that  --  between ourselves ? It gives me such a sense of quiet power . And maybe it 'll impress my visitor . Do have a cup of tea , Mr. Kurt . She gives him one. p. 43 KURT puts his hat on sofa left.I am not impressed by politicians . And I did n't come to drink tea . I am here on business . Nevertheless he takes a hearty sip . MARION Well , you can do both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tense . KURT I 'm not a businessman . NOLAN Well , whatever you are , you are very ill-mannered . KURT pleased.That 's true ! MARION delighted.Is n't it nice you agree ? For a moment I thought you were n't going to hit it off . NOLAN In my day if a boy came in and behaved like this before a lady he 'd be horsewhipped . KURT Well , when you get into the Senate you can introduce a horsewhipping bill . Probably bring you great kudos . NOLAN You talk like a Bolshevik . KURT Thank you ! You talk like a Senator ! MARION wants to laugh but thinks better of it . She looks at KURT with a new eye . MARION quickly offering him more tea . Another cup , Mr. Kurt . p. 44 KURT taking it.Thank you . MARION And one of these cakes  --  they 're very nice Minnie made them  --  almost as good as lebkuchen . Minnie spoils me . KURT taking it.Thank you . Eats cakeHaving said , from our respective points of view , the worst thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate insult , there 's no reason we ca n't be friends , Senator . Damn good cake . No lunch as a matter of fact . MARION That 's what 's the matter with him  --  he was hungry  --  hungry boy . NOLAN puts teacup on piano.He probably wants to sell you some insurance . KURT Not at all . I 'm not here to sell . I 'm here to buy . MARION A picture ! KURT Do I look like a picture-buyer ? MARION As a matter of fact you do n't but I have n't anything to sell except pictures . KURT confidently.I think you have ! MARION to NOLAN.This young man is very tantalizing. p. 45 NOLAN Well , why do n't you ask him to state his proposition and have done with it ? MARION turns to KURT and repeats mechanically.State your proposition and have done with it . KURT puts his cup down on table rear of sofa left.What a nuisance women are ! NOLAN starting toward him. Why , you insolent young whelp  --  I 've half a mind to KURT pleasantly.That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady a business letter asking for an appointment . She granted it to me at four o'clock . It is now six . In that interval I 've climbed these five flights of stairs three times . I 've lost over an hour of my life going away and coming back . An hour in which I might have read a first-class book or made love to a girl or had an idea  --  an irreparable hour . That 's rudeness if you like . It 's unbusinesslike . It 's sloppy . To MARIONNow will you see me alone or will you keep me here fencing with this inadequate antagonist ? MARION You are unquestionably the most impossible young man I 've ever met . Go away ! KURT Right ! He turns to go and means it and she knows that he means it . And she is consumed with curiosity . As he goesSo long , Senator ! Yours for the Revolution ! p. 46 MARION as he reaches door , goes after him  --  pleads pitifully.Young man ! Mr. Nolan is an old friend of mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may suggest . Ca n't you speak in front of him ? At the same time she shakes her head to him not to go away . KURT I can not ! MARION Please wait a minute . KURT All right  --  one . He picks up a magazine and leafs through it negligently . MARION to LEANDER.After all , Leander , I ca n't afford  --  it may be something . She takes his arm and starts walking him to the door , whisperingI 'm just curious to hear what he 's got to say for himself . NOLAN I 'm not sure it 's safe to leave you alone with a character like that . MARION Minnie 's in her room with a bow and arrow ! NOLAN going up to hall door. I have to go in any case  --  I 'm late now . MARION When will I see you , Bunny ? She is at door with him. p. 47 NOLAN taking up his hat and coat.I do n't know . I 'm very busy . I 'll telephone you . MARION Do . Telephone me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 'll probably be funny . NOLAN out loud at KURT.It pains me , Marion , that you are so unprotected that any hooligan  --  KURT turns page of magazine  --  can write you and come to see you in your apartment . However , that is the way you have chosen . Good night . MARION Good night , dear . Are you in the book ? I 'll telephone you NOLAN hastily.No  --  no  --  you 'd better not . I shall communicate with you . Good-bye . KURT Good-bye , Sir Galahad . NOLAN starts to retort , changes his mind and , in a very choleric mood , he goes out . There is a pause . MARION Well , I 'm afraid you did n't make a very good impression on him ! KURT putting magazine away.That 's just too bad ! MARION That 's no way for a young man to get on in the world  --  he 's a very important person . p. 48 KURT That 's what passes for importance . You 're not taken in by him , are you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARION As a matter of fact he 's a very nice man  --  simple and kindly . Gets cigarettes and offers one to KURT who takes it and lights it . She takes one too but he forgets to light hers . KURT I bet he is n't simple and he is n't kindly . I bet he 's greedy and vicious . Anyway he 's a hypocrite . When a man starts worrying out loud about unprotected women you may know he 's a hypocritical sensualist . MARION You 're a violent young man , are n't you ? Not getting light from KURT she lights her own . Throwing match to floor KURT Yes . The world is full of things and people that make me see red . Why do you keep calling me youth and young man ? I 'm twenty-five . MARION Well , you seem to have the lurid and uncorrected imagination of the adolescent . KURT Imagination ! That 's where you 're wrong . I may tell you , Miss Froude , that I 'm as realistic as anybody you 've ever met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 'd be so unreasonable over a nice fellow like Bunny Nolan if you only knew  --  if only you 'd been present at the interview I had with him just before you came . You 'd have seen how wrong you are about him . Why , he was  --  he was awfully funny  --  but he was also touching . p. 49 KURT You 're one of those tolerant people , are n't you  --  see the best in people ? MARION You say that as if tolerance were a crime . KURT Your kind is . It 's criminal because it encourages dishonesty , incompetence , weakness and all kinds of knavery . What you call tolerance I call sloppy laziness . You 're like those book-reviewers who find something to praise in every mediocre book . MARION You are a fanatical young man . KURT Having said that you think you dispose of me . Well , so be it . I 'm disposed of . Now , let 's get down to business . His manner plainly says : " Well , why should I bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you think of me ? " It is not wasted on MARION . MARION You are also a little patronizing KURT pleased.Am I ? MARION However , I do n't mind being patronized . That 's where my tolerance comes in . It even amuses me a little bit . Crossing to piano seatBut as I have to change for dinner perhaps you 'd better KURT Exactly . MARION Please sit down A moment She sits on piano bench facing him. p. 50 KURT goes to piano and talks to her across it. I am the editor of a magazine called Every Week . Do you know it ? MARION It seems to me I 've seen it on newsstands . KURT You 've never read it ? MARION I 'm afraid I have n't . KURT That is a tribute to your discrimination . We have an immense circulation . Three millions , I believe . With a circulation of that size you may imagine that the average of our readers ' intelligence can not be very high . Yet occasionally we flatter them by printing the highbrows  --  in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wells and Chesterton . So you 'll be in good company anyway . MARION amazed.I will ? KURT Yes . I want you to write your biography to run serially in Every Week . Later of course you can bring it out as a book . MARION My biography ! KURT Yes . The story of your life . MARION with dignity.I know the meaning of the word . KURT The money is pretty good . I am prepared to give you an advance of two thousand dollars . p. 51 MARION Good Heavens , am I as old as that  --  that people want my biography ? KURT We proceed on the theory that nothing exciting happens to people after they are forty . MARION What a cruel idea ! KURT Why wait till you 're eighty ? Your impressions will be dimmed by time . Most autobiographies are written by corpses . Why not do yours while you are still young , vital , in the thick of life ? MARION But I 'm not a writer . I should n't know how to begin . KURT You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MARION I write pleasant letters , my friends tell me . But look here , why should you want this story from me  --  why should anybody be interested ?  --  I 'm not a first-rate artist you know  --  not by far  --  I 'm just clever . KURT bluntly.It 's not you  --  it 's the celebrity of your subjects . MARION amused.You 're a brutal young man  --  I rather like you KURT Well , you 've been courageous . You 've been forthright . For an American woman you 've had a rather extraordinary career  --  you 've done pretty well what you wanted . p. 52 MARION The-Woman-Who-Dared sort of thing . Is n't that pass ? KURT I think your life will make good copy . You might have stayed here and settled down and done Pictorial Review covers of mothers hovering fondly over babies . Instead you went to Europe and managed to get the most inaccessible people to sit for you . How did you do it ? MARION You 'd be surprised how accessible some of these inaccessible people are ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get from your story . Just that . Tell what happened to you , that 's all . The impulse that made you leave home , that made you go , for instance , to Russia , before the popular emigration set in , that 's made you wander ever since , that 's kept you from settling down in any of the places where you had a chance to get established . MARION quite seriously.But supposing I do n't know that . KURT Well , that 's interesting . That enigma is interesting . Maybe , while writing , you can solve it . It 's a form of clarification . The more I talk to you the more I feel there 's a great story in you and that you 'll have great fun telling it . MARION Young man , you make me feel like an institution ! p. 53 KURT Should do you a lot of good in your professional career too  --  we 'll reprint the portraits you 've made of Lenin , Mussolini , Shaw  --  anything you like . She begins to laugh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . KURT unperturbed.What 's the matter ? MARION Something I remembered  --  the funniest thing  --  is n't it funny how the oddest things pop into your mind ? KURT What was it ? MARION Something that happened years ago . KURT What ? MARION Oh , I could n't possibly tell you . It would n't be fair ! KURT In that case it 'll probably be great for the magazine . Save it ! MARION frightened.You wo n't do anything lurid , will you ? KURT Just print the story  --  just as you write it  --  practically as you write it . MARION I 'm scared ! She puts out her cigarette in ash tray on the piano. p. 54 KURT Nonsense . Here 's your first check . Two thousand dollars . He puts the check down on the table in front of her . MARION wretched suddenly , picks up check , rises , looks at check.I ca n't tell you how old this makes me feel ! KURT Suppose I asked you to write a novel ! That would n't make you feel old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write a novel of your life . The only lively reading these days is biography . People are bored with fiction . It 's too tame . The fiction-writers have n't the audacity to put down what actually happens to people . MARION You may be disappointed , you know . You probably see headlines in your mind . The Woman of a Hundred Affairs , The Last of the Great Adventuresses , The Magda1 Magda , the famous heroine of Sudermann 's play , Die Heimat , a " new woman , " who returns to her father 's house as the mother of an illegitimate child and encounters his implacable wrath . The play had recently been revived in New York with Bertha Kalich in the leading role . Who Would n't Go Home . I promise you  --  it wo n't be a bit like that . KURT We 'll announce it next month  --  first installment the following month . O.K. ? MARION puts down check , paces down right.Oh dear ! I ca n't promise a thing like that  --  I really can't. p. 55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . KURT Well , do n't promise . Just get to work . MARION faces him. But what 'll I do first ? KURT getting up . Well , if I were you I 'd sit down . She does so helplessly on piano bench . KURT then gives her paper , one of his own pencils . There now ! You 're all set ! MARION wailing.How can I go out to dinner  --  how can I ever do anything  --  with a chapter to write ? KURT After all you do n't have to make up anything . Just tell what happened to you . He lights a fresh cigarette . MARION Can I use names ? KURT When they 're prominent , yes . The obscure ones you can fake if you want to . Nobody 'll know ' em anyway . MARION looks at him. Oh what 's your name ? KURT looks at her . I told you  --  my name 's Kurt . MARION I know  --  with a K  --  I ca n't call you Kurt ! What 's your name ? p. 56 KURT sulkily.Richard . MARION That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think  --  when I think  --  of the funny men I 've known they 're pretty nearly all brothers under the skin you know , Dickie . KURT Well , that , as they say in the office , is an angle . Suddenly her fear vanishes and she is overcome with the marvelous possibilities . MARION jumps up and leans toward him as if to kiss him , but quickly thinks better of it.Dickie , I think it 'll be marvelous ! It 'll be a knockout . And imagine  --  picking up check  --  I 'm going to be paid for it ! Dickie , you 're an angel ! KURT sardonically.That 's me . Angel Kurt ! Well , so long . I 'll be seeing you . Starts upstage toward hall door MARION suddenly panicky.Oh , do n't go ! KURT You do n't think I 'm going to sit here and hold your hand while you 're remembering your conquests , do you ? MARION Well , you ca n't go away and leave me like this  --  alone with my life . p. 57 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight , clear-eyed look at it  --  alone by yourself , without anybody around to hold your hand . MARION suddenly.No . I do n't want to . Shrugs her shoulders as if she were coldI think it would worry me . Besides , I feel superstitious about it . KURT following her downstage.Superstitious ! MARION Yes . A kind of  --  ultimate act . After you 've written your biography , what else could there possibly be left for you to do ? KURT Collect material for another ! MARION What could you do over again  --  that would n't be repetitious ? Sits on right arm of sofa right KURT It 's repetitious to eat or to make love , is n't it ? You keep on doing it . MARION You 're cynical ! KURT almost spits it out.You 're sentimental . MARION I am  --  Sentimental Journey1 Sentimental Journey , the title of an autobiographical novel by Laurence Sterne.  --  no , that 's been used , has n't it ? p. 58 KURT Do n't worry about a title  --  I 'll get that from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about it  --  I do n't know  --  KURT What ? MARION Vulgar . Everybody spouting memoirs . Who cares ? KURT Well , wrong hunch ! Sorry to have taken your valuable time . Good-bye . MARION the finality frightens her. What do you mean ? KURT he is withering  --  crosses to her . I 'm prepared to admit I was mistaken  --  that 's all . In your desire to escape vulgarity you would probably be  --  thin . You might even achieve refinement . I 'm not interested . Padded episodes hovering on the edge of amour  --  MARION turns on him.Young man , you 're insufferable ! KURT And you 're a false alarm ! MARION after a moment.I congratulate you ! You 've brought me to the verge of losing my temper ! But I tell you this  --  you 're quite mistaken about the character of my life  --  and about my relations with my friends . My story wo n't be thin and episodic because my life has n't been thin and episodic . And I wo n't have to pad  --  the problem will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn thing just to show you . Come in tomorrow afternoon for a cocktail . p. 59 KURT Whose memoirs are these going to be , yours or mine ? MARION Well , you 're an editor , are n't you ? She smiles at him . Come in and edit . KURT All right , I 'll come . But if you are n't here I 'll go away . I wo n't wait a minute . He goes out quickly . MARION stands looking after him , inclined to laugh , and yet affected . This is a new type even for her . MARION she speaks to herself.What an extraordinary young man ! In a moment KURT comes back in . MARION is very glad to see him , greets him as if there had been a long separation . Oh , hello ! KURT embarrassed.I forgot my hat ! He ca n't see it at once . MARION without moving nor looking away from him , she indicates the hat on the sofa left.There it is ! Right next to mine . KURT crosses for it. Oh yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands uncertainly , hat in hand , looking at MARION who has not taken her eyes off him . He is embarrassed . Well , so long ! p. 60 MARION So long . KURT leaves again . She stands as before looking after him . She turns toward the piano  --  sees the check  --  picks it up and reads it to make sure it 's true . The whole thing has a slightly fantastic quality to her . She is very happy and excited . She waves the check in her hand like a pennant and humming she crosses to the piano seat and sits and plays the waltz from " Danubia . " She sees the pad and pencil on the piano and stops playing and , picking up the pencil and the pad , she crosses to the small armchair in the upstage end of the window and sits with her feet on the window seat . She repeats the first words of the first chapter aloud to herself as she writes them down I am born MINNIE enters from door left to get the tea things she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil on the pad as she repeats the words . I am born The time seems remote to her . I am born  --  I meet Richard Kurt  --  Well , Minnie , here 's the outline  --  I am born I meet Richard Kurt  --  now all I have to do is to fill in . MINNIE , used to having irrelevancies addressed to her , takes this program rather stolidly . MINNIE Was , Marion ? MARION trying to get rid of her.Fix something light , will you , Minnie I 'm not going out . p. 61 MINNIE Aber der Junge kommt ! MARION What Junge ? MINNIE Der Junge dem Sie MARION Oh , yes ! The Junge I met on the boat . You 'll have to send him away . I ca n't go out tonight . From now on , Minnie , no more frivolous engagements ! MINNIE astonished.Sie bleiben ganzen abend zu Hause ? MARION Yes , Minnie . I 'm spending the evening alone with my life She remembers KURT 'S words and repeats them as if , after all , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , straight , clear-eyed look at it MINNIE picks up the tea tray and , bustling toward the kitchen , promising delights.Ein Fleischbrhe und Pfannkuchen ! MINNIE exits door left . MARION already brooding over her past.I am born . Slowly the curtain falls. @x SCENE : The same . About three weeks later . Afternoon . AT RISE : MARION is putting some touches on the full-length portrait of LEANDER NOLAN which stands away from the audience . She is wearing her working costume , baggy red corduroy trousers , a sash and a worn blue smock over a kind of sweater-jacket . She is very happy . On the piano nearby are her writing things . While touching up LEANDER she is struck by an idea for her book . Puts down her brush and palette and goes to the piano to jot down some notes . The idea pleases her . She giggles to herself . Then she returns to her casel . MINNIE comes in and stands watching her a moment before MARION sees her . MARION sees MINNIE at last.Oh yes , Minnie  --  do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , Marion . MARION Did I ? MINNIE Ja . Sitting on sofa rightZo ! You have left a note on the kitchen I should come in right away I am back from the market . MARION studying the portrait.Of course I did . That 's right , Minnie . MINNIE Well , what did you want , Marion ? p. 63 MARION washing paint brush in turpentine jar.Did I tell you there 'd be two for dinner ? MINNIE Ja . Gewiss ! Das ist vy I vent to the market . MARION Well , I 've changed my plans . I 'm dining out with Feydie after all . MINNIE rising and looking at picture.Ach , Gott ! She studies the portrait . MARION looks humorously at MINNIE and puts her arm about MINNIE 'S shoulders . Gut ? MINNIE Ziemlich gut  --  MARION Do you know who it is ? MINNIE Oh , das sieht man ja gleich . Das ist Herr Nolan ! MARION shaking her hand in gratitude.Thank you , Minnie . Doorbell ringsSee who that is , will you , Minnie ? MINNIE Frulein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fr ihn bin ich immer zu Hause . MINNIE agreeing heartily as she crosses to the door.Ja , Ja , der Herr Feydak . MINNIE goes out . MARION jots down a note on the pad which is on the piano . FEYDAK enters . MINNIE closes the door and exits left. p. 64 MARION at piano.Hello , Feydie ! Sit down ! FEYDAK Well , my dear , which career do I interrupt ? MARION laughing. I do n't know ! FEYDAK One comes to see you with diffidence nowadays . FEYDAK removes coat and hat and places them on the upstage end of the sofa right , and sits on the left side of the sofa . MARION While I 'm painting I think of funny things to say , funny phrases . It wo n't be a serious biography , thank God . I 'm dedicating it to Vicki : " To Vicki  --  the gayest person I have ever known ! " By the way , have you got any little snapshots of Vicki  --  all I 've got are formal photographs with his orders . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll hunt some up for you . MARION Have you heard from the Powers yet , when you are to leave ? FEYDAK Tomorrow . MARION stricken  --  sits right of him.Feydie ! FEYDAK fatalistically.Tomorrow . They sit . I shall leave you with sorrow , Marion . p. 65 MARION I 'll have no one to laugh with . FEYDAK For me it 's an exile . MARION You 'll have a wonderful time . I shall miss you terribly . FEYDAK Perhaps you 'll come out . MARION Perhaps I will . I 've always wanted to go to China . If I have enough money left from all my labors I 'll stop in on you  --  ep route to China . FEYDAK That would be marvelous . MARION You know writing one 's life has a sobering effect on one  --  you get it together and you think : " Well ! look at the damn thing " FEYDAK Do you want to be impressive ? MARION Well , I do n't want to be trivial FEYDAK I think you escape that . MARION My friendships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeeze . FEYDAK Have you seen that bombastic young man ? MARION Oh , yes . He comes in every once in a while to see how I 'm getting on . He 's quite insulting . Underneath his arrogance I suspect he 's very uncertain . p. 66 FEYDAK Oh , now , do n't tell me he has an inferiority complex ! MARION Well , I think he has ! FEYDAK The new psychology is very confusing . In my simple day you said : " That young man is bumptious and insufferable " and you dismissed him . Now you say : " He has an inferiority complex " and you encourage him to be more bumptious and more insufferable. it 's very confusing . MARION There 's a kind of honesty about him that I like . FEYDAK instantly putting two and two together.Oh ! MARION Nothing like that , Feydie ! As a matter of fact  --  I do n't mind telling you I like him very much  --  FEYDAK I think he is destined MARION He 's not interested . He 's some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind in Russia  --  quite unassailable . But I 'm optimistic . They laugh . Well , one must never despair , must one . Life is so much more resourceful and resilient than one is oneself . Three weeks ago when you came to see me I felt quite at the end of my rope . I did n't tell you quite but I actually did n't know which way to turn . I felt tired too  --  which troubled me . Well , now I find myself , quite suddenly  --  she indicates portrait  --  doing Leander and  --  she indicates manuscript on piano  --  doing myself . New Vista . Very exciting . p. 67 FEYDAK All this enthusiasm for art alone ? MARION laughing.Of course !  --  Feydie , what did you think ? FEYDAK I do n't believe it . MARION Come here and have a look at Leander ! FEYDAK he rises  --  walks to the canvas on the easel.Hm ! Formal ! MARION It 's to hang in the White House . She winks at him , he laughs , puts his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! They walk downstage together , their arms around each other 's shoulders , very affectionately . MARION Oh , Feydie , I 'm having a wonderful time . Quiet too . Writing enforces silence and solitude on one . I 've always lived in such a rush  --  a kind of interminable scherzo . FEYDAK Good title ! MARION Think so ? I 'll put it down . Writes on pad on piano . FEYDAK sits on right arm of sofa left , facing her . Interminable scherzo . How do you spell it ? A little affected . Might do for a chapter heading maybe . Returns to him  --  sitting on model stand  --  facing himBut I realize now I have n't in years had time to stop and think . I sit here for hours , Feydie , and nothing comes to me . Then , suddenly , the past will come in on me with such a rush  --  odd , remote , semi-forgotten things of the past . Are they true ? How much is true ? One can never be sure , can one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their existence without recalling at all their intensity  --  their special anguish . Why ? What was the matter with me ? What made them so acute ? It is like recalling a landscape without color , a kind of color-blindness of the memory . Doorbell rings . She calls out to her factotum . Minnie ! MINNIE enters left and crosses rapidly to hall door . MARION arranges the model stand on which stands the papal armchair in red and gold . This is probably the Hon. Nolan . He 's due for a sitting . He pretends he does n't like to have his picture painted , but I know he does . MINNIE enters from hallway . She is flustered and giggly. p. 68 MINNIE very high-pitched voice.Herr Varvick Vilson ! MARION Tympi Wilson ! MINNIE to FEYDAK.Der film star ! . FEYDAK So ? MINNIE radiant.Ja ! Ja ! MARION Oh , Feydie , you 'll adore this . Ask him in , Minnie . MINNIE as she goes out to admit WILSON.Gott , ist er schn ! 1 Gott schn ! God , is he handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MARION in a quick whisper.Whatever you do  --  outstay him ! MINNIE has opened the door and WARWICK WILSON enters . He is very handsome , explosively emotional , and given to cosmic generalization . He is in evening clothes , a red carnation in his buttonhole . WILSON crossing to MARION and kissing her hand.Marion ! MARION Warwick ! WILSON Darling ! How are you ? p. 69 MARION I 'm splendid . Been up all night ? WILSON No , no ! This is business . MINNIE has crossed to kitchen door upper left , never taking her eyes from WILSON . MARION This is Mr. Feydak . Mr. Warwick Wilson , the famous film star . WILSON crosses to sofa and shakes hands with FEYDAK  --  dramatically.Feydak ! The Mr. Feydak ? FEYDAK again mistaken for his brother.Ja . WILSON I 've heard of you indeed ! FEYDAK Have you ? Thanks . MARION Mr. Feydak is on his way to Hollywood . He is to write the music for WILSON sits on the model stand  --  facing front.Of course ! I am honored , Mr. Feydak  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ? He starts to hum with a swaying gesture the waltz from the " Merry Widow . " Music 's my one passion ! MARION Once you said it was me . WILSON A lot of good it did me ! p. 70 MARION to WILSON.Well , tell me She sees MINNIE , who is still staring at WILSON . Look at Minnie . The mere sight of you has upset her so that she 's speechless . MINNIE Aber , Frulein ! 1 Aber . Frulein ! But , Miss ! WILSON rises graciously and gives MINNIE a friendly wave of the hand . He 's no snob . MINNIE , speechless with delight , exits left . WILSON returns to his position on the model stand . MARION All right , Minnie ! Warwick , Warwick ! You must n't do things like that to Minnie , at her age ! WILSON tragically.There you are ! This face ! This cursed face ! I should go masked really . One has no private life ! MARION sits in throne chair on model stand.What would you do with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delighted.That nickname ! MARION It just rolled off my tongue . Did I call you that ? WILSON You did ! You invented it . No one 's called me that since you left Hollywood . And you promised to explain the significance to me , but you never did . p. 71 MARION Did it have a significance ? FEYDAK Marion has a knack for nicknames . MARION I love ' em . I 'd like to do a chapter on nicknames . WILSON highly pleased.Tympi ! Tympi ! Very patronizing to FEYDAKYou are an intuitive person , Mr. Feydak . I can see that . FEYDAK ad libs : " Danke schn . " Can you imagine what she meant ? FEYDAK Her vagaries are beyond me , Mr. Wilson . WILSON leaning back toward MARION.Speak , Oracle ! No ! Do n't tell me now . Put it into that book you 're writing . MARION MARION and FEYDAK exchange glances.How things get around . WILSON It 's been in the back of my mind for years , Marion to have you paint me . Now that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to WILSON In the costume of the Dane . MARION and FEYDAK exchange a look . Strikes a poseI 'd like to be done in his costume . I hope , Mr. Feydak , that they wo n't break your spirit in Hollywood as they 've almost broken mine ! p. 72 FEYDAK with a smile.My spirit is indestructible ! WILSON rises and crosses to rear of sofa and pats FEYDAK on the back. I 'm glad to hear it . Returns to left of model stand and stands with his right foot on it You know , for years I 've been begging them to do Shakespeare . Gesticulates MARION interrupting him.Sit down and be comfortable . WILSON They simply wo n't listen . But I 'm going to give up acting and produce ! MARION Oh , good God ! Do n't do that ! WILSON Why not ? MARION What would Minnie do with her night off ? WILSON smiles.My public , eh ? MARION Yes ! WILSON Quite so ! PatronizinglyYou artists who work in media like painting or literature  --  to FEYDAK  --  or music , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech  --  transcends everything ; by saying nothing it says all . p. 73 FEYDAK Ja ! The doorbell rings . WILSON You are certainly lucky compared to us poor actors . We  --  MINNIE enters and crosses to hall door upper center . Would n't it be ironic if all that remained of me after I am gone were your painting of me ? That is why I want it , perhaps  --  my poor grasp on immortality . FEYDAK You see , Marion , you confer immortality ! MARION I think immortality is an overrated commodity . But tell me , Tympi , what are you doing away from Hollywood ? MINNIE comes in announcing.Der Herr Nolan ! MINNIE then looks at WILSON . WILSON stands  --  looks at MINNIE . MARION Show him in . Show him in . With a lingering look at WILSON , MINNIE goes back . To others , after watching MINNIE exitYou see ! FEYDAK The effect is instantaneous  --  like music NOLAN enters . MINNIE follows NOLAN in and exits into kitchen , murmuring ecstatically , " Gott ! 1st er schn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bunny . Introducing NOLANYou know Mr. Feydak . Mr. Nolan , this is Warwick Wilson , you 've heard of him . FEYDAK bows to NOLAN , who returns the bow. p. 74 WILSON It 's a pleasure , Mr. Nolan . I 've heard of you indeed ! They shake hands . MARION You 're late for your sitting , Bunny . Will the presence of these gentlemen embarrass you ? I do n't mind if you do n't . NOLAN has entered rather worried and angry . He has a magazine rolled in his hand . He now speaks very irritatedly.As a matter of fact , Marion MARION putting him in throne chair on model stand.Oh , sit down , like a good fellow . The light is getting bad . NOLAN sits . WILSON sits on the right arm of the sofa left on which FEYDAK is sitting . MARION gets to work on BUNNY . How did you find me , Tympi ? WILSON I read in a magazine that you were barging into literature NOLAN half rising , showing magazine.This is true then ! MARION Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looks at it . Well , Dickie has gone and spread himself , has n't he ? She sits on sofa left between WILSON and FEYDAK . Look here , Feydie ! Shows him the full-page announcement of her book in magazine. p. 75 FEYDAK looking.Do you think you can live up to this ? MARION Why will they write this sort of thing ? Rises and goes backMakes me out a kind of female Casanova . She drops the magazine on the stand at NOLAN 's feet . Well , they 'll be disappointed . NOLAN bitterly.Will they ? MARION Bunny ! But she thinks nothing of it  --  merely pushes him into a better light . FEYDAK tactfully  --  he senses danger.May I ask , Mr. Wilson  --  are you making a picture at the moment ? WILSON No , I 'm in New York making some personal appearances . MARION Personal appearances . I love that phrase . Has such an air of magnanimity about it . Crosses to painting WILSON Pretty boring , I can tell you ! I 've got writer 's cramp signing autograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's no fun at all . WILSON crosses to stand  --  puts his right foot on it , leans on his knee with his right arm and studies NOLAN , his face not six inches away from NOLAN 'S . NOLAN fidgets. p. 76 MARION I can imagine ! What 's the matter , Bunny ? You seem under a strain today not relaxed . NOLAN bursting out and glaring at all of them.It 's like being watched while you 're taking a bath ! MARION Oh , I 'm so sorry , Bunny ! FEYDAK rising.I quite sympathize with Mr. Nolan . WILSON moves away.Supposing I were so shy , eh , Mr. Nolan ? FEYDAK crosses to MARION who is above her easel , right. I 'm off , Marion . Kisses her handAuf Wiedersehen ! MARION meaningfully.You 'll have to go  --  WILSON sits again on arm of sofa left  --  both of you WILSON rises.I was just going myself . My next appearance is at 6:45 . Speaks to others FEYDAK to help her.Perhaps I can drop you , Mr. Wilson . WILSON faces FEYDAK.No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FEYDAK , helpless , goes upstage putting on coat. p. 77 MARION Yes , Tympi ? WILSON If you started my portrait right away and it turns out  --  I am sure it will turn out  --  you might put it in your book , might n't you ? I 'm frankly sick of just appearing in fan magazines . MARION We 'll see . Why not ? WILSON Splendid ! Do n't fail to come tonight . Good-bye , dearest Marion . Good-bye again , Mr. Nolan . He starts to shake NOLAN 'S hand but is interrupted by MARION , almost screaming . MARION No , no , no ! Do n't do that  --  do n't touch him . WILSON Most happy ! See you later . He waves himself off at last  --  MARION returns to her easel . MARION to FEYDAK.Do n't forget  --  I 'm dining with you . FEYDAK like the player in " Hamlet " who burlesques Polonius.Most happy  --  see you later . FEYDAK leaves . MARION with relief.Now then NOLAN muttering to himself.Silly ass ! p. 78 MARION working on painting.That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , do you realize that , Bunny ? His profile follows you all over Europe  --  and Asia . Ubiquitous profile . Have you ever seen him ? NOLAN unswerved.He 's a silly ass ! MARION I admit he 's somewhat on that side  --  but that other one  --  that Feydie  --  he 's the darling of the world ! NOLAN very short  --  bitterly.Evidently ! MARION surprised.Bunny ! NOLAN savage now.Who is n't a darling ? Everyone 's a darling as far as I can see ! The world 's full of darlings . Your world at any rate . MARION But , darling She suddenly stops  --  sits at right end of sofa right . Oh , Bunny , I remember now ! NOLAN You remember what ? MARION Tympi ! Why I nicknamed him Tympi . Do n't you see ? NOLAN No , I do n't see MARION For tympanum  --  a large instrument in the orchestra producing a hollow sound . She beats an imaginary drum with her paint brush . Boom ! Suddenly NOLAN quits the pose . What is it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not in the mood . MARION I could tell there was something worrying you . NOLAN There is something worrying me ! MARION Well , what is it ? NOLAN This confounded story ! Are you really writing it ? MARION Well , yes  --  I am . NOLAN What do you intend to tell ? MARION Well , that 's a rather difficult question to answer  --  it 's like asking me what I 've been doing all my life . NOLAN When does this biography start ? MARION beginning to wonder about this questioning.With my birth  --  coincidence , is n't it ? NOLAN All the time back home  --  when you were a girl in Knoxville ? MARION Yes , of course . I 've had a wonderful time going back over it all . NOLAN Everything ? MARION Everything I can remember . NOLAN Do I come into it ? MARION smiling to herself.You do ! You certainly do ! p. 80 NOLAN You must leave me out of that story ! MARION But Bunny , how can I possibly leave you out ? NOLAN You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? You were too important  --  think of the rle you played in my life . By your own confession , Bunny darling , you  --  you started me . That 's a good idea for a chapter heading , is n't it ? " Bunny Starts Me . " I must put that down . NOLAN This is no joke , Marion . With menaceI warn you MARION Warn me ! Let me understand you . Are you seriously asking me to give up an opportunity like this just because NOLAN rises and gets down from the model stand . Speaks with brutal command.Opportunity ! Cheap exhibitionism ! A chance to flaunt your affairs in a rag like this . Indicating magazine on pianoI wo n't be drawn into it . I can tell you that ! He is in a towering rage . MARION after a pause.I know that by your standards , Bunny , I 'm a loose character . But there are other standards , there just are . NOLAN crosses to center  --  drops magazine on model stand.Not in Tennessee ! p. 81 MARION rises.I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry . MARION takes off her smock , crosses to small table down right , gets her notes , then crosses to desk upper right. I do n't care what the advertisements say about my story  --  I know what I 'm writing NOLAN I 'm sorry . MARION That 's all right . But this has gone pretty deep . NOLAN after a pause.If you 're doing this for money  --  She turns and watches him . I know you 've been pretty hard up  --  I promise you I 'll get you commissions enough to more than make up for this story . I was talking about you only the other day to my prospective father-in-law . He 's a big man , you know . I am sure I can get him to sit for you MARION The tip is n't big enough . NOLAN scared now that he sees the extent to which he has hurt her.Marion ! MARION It amuses me to write my life . I am pleasure-loving  --  you know that  --  I will therefore pass up the opportunity of painting your big father-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . And we can part friends , then , ca n't we ? She reaches out her hand to him . Good-bye , Bunny . p. 82 NOLAN devastated.Marion  --  you ca n't do this to me  --  you ca n't send me away like this MARION I do n't think I 've ever in my life had a vulgar quarrel with anyone . This is the nearest I 've come to it . I 'm a little annoyed with you for that . I think it 's better we part now while we can still do so with some  --  dignity . Shall we ? NOLAN You do n't realize what 's involved  --  or you would n't talk like that MARION What is involved ? NOLAN My entire career . That 's what 's involved . MARION Oh ! NOLAN This is the most critical moment of my life . My fiance 's father is the most powerful leader of opinion in my state . Frankly , I depend on him for support . To have this kind of thing bandied about now might cause a permanent rift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only with my candidacy for the Senate , but with my marriage . MARION They are interlocking  --  I quite understand . NOLAN A revelation of this kind  --  coming at this moment  --  might be fatal MARION Revelation ! You make me feel like  --  I ca n't tell you what you make me feel like She laughs  --  semihysterically. p. 83 NOLAN sepulchral.You must give this up , Marion . MARION I 've met distinguished men abroad  --  politicians , statesmen  --  a Prime Minister even  --  and this kind of " revelation "  --  as you so luridly call it  --  is no more to them than a theme for after-dinner banter . They take it in their stride . My God , Bunny , you take it so big ! NOLAN These people I 'm depending on to elect me are n't sophisticated like you or me . MARION looks at NOLAN with some surprise . What I mean is  --  they 're country people essentially  --  my future father-in-law is sympathetic to their point of view . MARION Tell me  --  your father-in-law , is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine sturdy man  --  as you perhaps know , he makes a fetish of exercise . MARION bubbling again.You see his pictures in shorts in health magazines . NOLAN There 's no disgrace in that . MARION sits on right arm of sofa left.It does n't shock me , Bunny . I was just identifying him , that 's all . p. 84 NOLAN I owe everything to Kinnicott  --  I would n't be running for the Senate right now if not for him . I ca n't risk offending him . MARION What the devil 's happened to you anyway ? You used to be quite a nice boy  --  even fun occasionally NOLAN wistful  --  turns away.Maybe  --  if you had stuck to me MARION Ts ! Ts ! Ts ! Poor Bunny . I 'm sorry for you . Really I am . She strokes his arm . NOLAN suddenly passionate  --  faces her. Do n't touch me ! MARION amazed.Bunny ! NOLAN Do you think I 'm not human ! MARION Well , if you are n't the most contradictory NOLAN I realized the moment I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you MARION interrupting.But Bunny ! You 're engaged and you 're going to be a Senator . NOLAN walks away from her.Forget it ! Forget I ever said it . p. 85 MARION You bewilder me NOLAN bitterly.I 'm not surprised I bewilder you . You 've spent your life among a lot of foreign counts . It 's well known that foreigners are more immoral than we are . MARION I 'm very touched . I am really . She kisses him in a friendly way . NOLAN Do n't do that ! I forbid you ! MARION All right . I 'll never attack you again , I promise . NOLAN I wish I had never come back into your life  --  it was a terrible mistake  --  you 'd forgotten me . MARION seriously.Oh , you 're wrong . First love  --  one does n't forget that . NOLAN passionately.But you did ! You forgot me ! And if you got the chance again , you 'd humiliate me again . MARION Humiliate ! What queer notions you have  --  Is it a question of pride or vanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOLAN moves a step right.Please forget this  --  I do n't know what came over me  --  I p. 86 MARION Of course . There 's nothing to forget . Moves a step toward himIt 's quite all right , dear She pats him on his hand . Oh , excuse me NOLAN I warn you , Marion  --  I solemnly warn you  --  if you persist in this  --  MARION Never in my life have I seen a man vacillate so between passion and threat NOLAN I shall find ways to stop you . Mr. Kinnicott , my future father-in-law , is a powerful man . MARION I know . Extraordinary biceps . NOLAN I warn you , Marion . This matter is beyond flippancy . MARION sits.There 'll be some very distinguished people in my biography . You need n't be ashamed . NOLAN That movie-actor ! MARION Tympi in Hamlet costume  --  you in a toga . I 'll print your portraits on opposite pages  --  my two men ! NOLAN You are malicious ! MARION I must admit , Bunny , that you provoke in me all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convey to me what I 've missed in not marrying you . The back-door bell rings . MINNIE crosses to answer it during MARION 'S speech . You dangle before me the inventory of your felicities  --  a career , a fortune , a fabulous bride  --  and then , because I get a chance to chronicle my own adventures  --  you object  --  you tell me I must n't ! I have a nice nature , Bunny , or I should be angry  --  I should be indignant . KURT enters p. 87 NOLAN sharply and with threat.Now , Marion , I 've warned you You 'll regret this . MARION Hello , Dickie , do talk to Bunny for a minute , will you ? Crosses to the stairs and starts up them to her bedroomI 've simply got to change . MINNIE enters up center and exits left . Feydie 's coming to take me out to dinner . NOLAN But , Marion MARION I could n't do anything about this in any case , Bunny dear , because I 've promised Dickie . In fact , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go away , either of you . MARION blows them a kiss and exits into her bedroom . A pause between the two men . KURT crosses downstage to above the model stand . Suddenly , NOLAN goes to KURT and reaches out his hand to him . NOLAN How do you do , young man ? KURT very much surprised.How do you do ? He looks at him narrowly , his head a little on one side , a terrier appraising a mastiff . NOLAN I am very glad to see you . KURT Is n't that nice ? p. 88 NOLAN You may be surprised to learn that on the one occasion when we met you made quite an impression on me . KURT Did I ? NOLAN sits on sofa right.You did . Sit down . In fact  --  I hope you do n't mind  --  if you will allow me as a prerogative of seniority  --  to ask you a few questions . I have a purpose in mind and not  --  I trust  --  an idle purpose . KURT Shoot ! SitsAnything to enlighten the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has decided to be casual , naive and even respectful . NOLAN clearing his throat.Now then  --  your present position on the magazine you represent  --  have you been on it long ? KURT About two years . NOLAN And before that ? KURT Newspaper work . NOLAN And before that ? KURT Tramping around the world . Odd jobs . Quite a variety . NOLAN College ? KURT Believe it or not  --  Yale  --  two years worked my way through  --  washed dishes . p. 89 NOLAN Very interesting preparation very interesting Tell me now  --  your present work  --  do you find it interesting ? Is the remuneration satisfactory ? KURT Two hundred smackers a week . That 's twice what I 've ever earned in my life before . NOLAN Now then  --  to come to the point  --  no doubt you 've heard of my prospective father-in-law , Mr. Orrin Kinnicott ? KURT Heard of him ! We pay him the compliment of imitation . He is our model , our criterion , our guiding star ! NOLAN As you know , Mr. Kinnicott 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my state . The other day I heard him say that he wanted a new man in Washington . KURT playing naively excited.Now that 's something to give one 's eye-teeth for ! NOLAN pleased at the result.I think it might be possible to swing it  --  very possible . KURT God , what a break ! NOLAN As it happens , Mr. Kinnicott is at present in town . I shall arrange an appointment for you in the next few days . Naturally , I expect you to keep the matter entirely confidential . p. 90 KURT Naturally ! You need n't worry on that score , Senator , I assure you . NOLAN Thank you , Mr. Kurt . That is all I ask . A pause KURT Mr. Nolan  --  do you mind if I ask you something ? NOLAN Certainly not KURT You wo n't consider me impertinent ? NOLAN with a smile.I do n't object to impertinence , Mr. Kurt . I was often considered impertinent myself when I was your age . KURT Why are you making me this offer ? NOLAN I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedite KURT Why ? The first time we met we did n't exactly hit it off , now , did we ? Why then are you going to all this trouble ? NOLAN I have discussed you with Miss Froude , who is an old friend of mine and whose opinion I greatly respect . She thinks very highly of you , Mr. Kurt . My own impression KURT inexorably.Why ? What , as they say , is the pay-off ? NOLAN I 'll tell you . I 'll tell you quite frankly . I do n't want Miss Froude 's autobiography , which you have persuaded her to write , to appear in your magazine . I want it killed ! p. 91 KURT Oh ! You want it killed ? NOLAN Exactly . KURT Why ? NOLAN Marion knows why . We need n't go into that . KURT wounded by a sudden and devastating jealousy.Good God ! You ! You too ! MARION enters from balcony . She is wearing a dove-colored evening dress  --  the gamine transformed into lady-of-the-world . MARION Well ! How have you two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KURT seething . Crosses to foot of stairs.I 'll tell you what I think . MARION About the dress I mean She does a turn for them . NOLAN without looking up at her or the dress . He is watching KURT.It 's charming . MARION Thank you , Bunny . With all his faults Bunny is much more satisfactory than you are , Dickie . KURT at boiling point.He 's chivalrous , he is ! His chivalry is so exquisite that he has just been attempting to bribe me to keep your story from being published . His gallantry is so delicate that he 's terrified about being mentioned in it . p. 92 MARION comes down stairs during KURT 'S speech.Do n't be so worked up about it , Dickie . You 're another one who takes it big . It 's catching ! KURT flaring at her.You 're not very sensitive . MARION Why should I be ? You misapprehend Bunny . If he does n't want to be in the same story with me that 's his business . And it 's nothing to do with chivalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this young man KURT taunting him. What about Washington , Mr. Nolan ? Mr. Nolan , a prospective Senator , offers to bribe me with a post in Washington controlled by his prospective father-in-law . MARION If it 's a good job take it , Dickie , by all means . KURT I am afraid , Marion , that your code is more relaxed than mine MARION Code , nonsense ! I gave up codes long ago . I 'm a big laissezfaire girl ! NOLAN If this young man is an example of the distinguished company you 've come to associate with , Marion MARION Do n't quarrel , children  --  please . It distresses me. p. 93 NOLAN He 's extremely objectionable . KURT What about Washington , now , Senator ? Are you still willing to expedite ! KURT and NOLAN stand glaring at each other . MARION tries to calm the troubled waters . Crosses to NOLAN MARION Really , Dickie , you 're very naughty . Do n't mind him , Bunny . He 's very young . KURT And incorruptible ! NOLAN Marion , I claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some years , to beg you , very solemnly , not to prostitute your talents to his contemptible , sensation-mongering rag . KURT faces them.There 's a Senatorial sentence ! MARION Hush , Dickie , hush ! Bunny darling , it 's true that Dickie 's magazine is n't the Edinburgh Review . On the other hand your assumption that my story will be vulgar and sensational is a little gratuitous , is n't it ? NOLAN You refuse then ? MARION gently but with a serious overtone.Yes . This  --  censorship before publication seems to me , shall we say , unfair . It is  --  even in an old friend  --  dictatorial . p. 94 NOLAN with an air of finality.You leave me then no alternative . I am very sorry . KURT Do n't let him frighten you , Marion , he ca n't do anything . NOLAN I can forgive you anything , Marion , but the fact that you value my wishes below those of this insolent young man . MARION But this insolent young man has n't anything to do with it ! Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish that is involved . NOLAN I have explained to you the special circumstances . If you would consent to delay publication till after election . She turns to KURT to ask him to make this concession but ca n't get a word in . She is wedged between both of them . KURT She has nothing to do with the publication date . That 's my province . Gosh , what a chance for the circulation manager in Tennessee ! He rubs his palms together in mock anticipation of profits . NOLAN losing his temper at last.You are tampering with more than you bargain for Mr.  --  Mr.  --  KURT Kurt . MARION With a " K. " p. 95 NOLAN There are ways of dealing with a young man like this and you 'll soon find out what they are ! KURT Them 's harsh words , Senator ! NOLAN You wait and see . MARION Bunny ! NOLAN Do n't speak to me ! I never want to see you again ! He goes out . MARION really distressed.This is awful ! KURT highly elated.It 's wonderful ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear ! I 'll telephone him tonight KURT grimly.Over my dead body ! MARION Can it be , Dickie , that I control the election of Senators from Tennessee ? Sits at right end of sofa left KURT after a moment.How could you ever have loved a stuffed shirt like that ? MARION He was n't a stuffed shirt . That 's the funny part . He was charming . He was a charming boy . Rather thin . Rather reticent . He was much nicer than you , as a matter of fact . p. 96 KURT I 'm sure he was ! MARION He was much less violent ! KURT sits.Hypocritical old buccaneer ! MARION He used to work hard all day and at night he studied law . We used to walk the country lanes and dream about the future . He was scared  --  he was wistful . How did he emerge into this successful , ambitious , overcautious  --  mediocrity ? How do we all emerge into what we are ? How did I emerge into what I am ? I 've dug up some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was eager . I believe I was naive . Look at me now ! Time , Dickie What will you be at forty ? A bondholder and a commuter Oh , Dickie ! KURT tensely.I 'll never be forty ! MARION laughing.How will you avoid it ? KURT same tone.I 'll use myself up before I 'm forty . MARION Do you think so ? I do n't think so . RisesI sometimes wake up on certain mornings feeling absolutely  --  immortal ! Indestructible ! One is perpetually reborn , I think , Dickie . Everyone should write one 's life , I think  --  but not for publication . For oneself . A kind of spiritual Spring-cleaning ! p. 97 KURT The Ego preening ! MARION sitting on right arm of sofa left.Well , why not ? After all , one 's ego is all one really has . KURT Reminiscence is easy . So is anticipation . It 's the present that 's difficult and most people are too lazy or too indifferent to cope with it . MARION It 's natural for you to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future either , because the intimation of the future comes only with the sense of the past KURT with sudden bitterness.I see the past as an evil thing  --  to be extirpated . MARION How awful ! PauseWhy ? KURT That 's not important . MARION rises. You freeze up so whenever I try to find out anything about you . I 'm not used to that . Usually people open up to me  --  I 'm a born confidante . But not you . I 'm interested too , because in an odd way I 've become very fond of you . KURT My life 's very dull , I assure you . My past lacks completely what you would call glamour . p. 98 MARION No , Dickie . I do n't believe that . I do n't believe that 's true of anybody 's life . KURT Well , it 's true . Moreover it 's true of most people 's lives . It 's easy for anyone who 's lived as you have to make romantic generalizations . It 's very pleasant for you to believe them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from herWhy should I ? It 's not important . She is sitting down , smoking a cigarette in a holder , watching him . He becomes conscious that she is studying him . MARION I had no idea you felt this way about me  --  you despise me , do n't you ? He does n't answer . Do n't you ? KURT Yes . MARION Why ? KURT rises . Walks away.Why did we start this ? MARION You 're annoyed at having even momentarily revealed yourself , are n't you ? I 'll have your secret , Dickie  --  I 'll pluck out the heart of your mystery . KURT Secret ! Mystery ! More romantic nonsense . I have no secret . Nobody has a secret . There are different kinds of greed , different kinds of ambition  --  that 's all ! MARION Oh , you simplify too much  --  really I 'm afraid you do . Tell me  --  why do you disapprove of me ? Is it  --  as Bunny does  --  on moral grounds ? p. 99 KURT right end of sofa left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take life , which is a tragic thing , as though it were a trivial bedroom farce . You 're a second-rate artist who 's acquired a reputation through vamping celebrities to sit for you . MARION quietly , she continues smoking.Go on KURT As an unglamorous upstart who has been forced to make my way I resent parasitism , that 's all ! MARION Is n't there in biology something about benevolent parasites , Dickie ? Many great men , I believe , owe a debt of gratitude to their parasites , as many plants do there are varieties . Again , Dickie , you simplify unduly . It is a defect of the radical and the young . KURT To return to the Honorable Nolan MARION I return to him with relief KURT He may exert pressure on us , you know MARION How ? I 'm very interested . KURT Well , for one thing , his future father-in-law might get me fired . MARION Could he do that ? p. 100 KURT He might . He might easily . MARION sits upright and looks at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief and offer him a bigger job  --  anything . MARION All on account of my poor little biography  --  It seems incredible that anyone would take all this trouble . KURT I 'd just like to see them try  --  I 'd just like to , that 's all MARION What would you do ? KURT Do ? I 'd make the Honorable Nolan the laughing stock of the country , and his athletic father-in-law too . I 'd just plaster them , that 's what I 'd do . MARION You sound vindictive . KURT Baby , I am vindictive ! MARION Funny , I 'm just amused . KURT Well , everything 's a spectacle to you ! Turns away from herGod , how I hate detachment ! MARION Your desire to break up Bunny is quite impersonal then . KURT Surgical . Just as impersonal as that . MARION You 're a funny boy , Dickie . KURT turns away from her . I 'm not funny and I 'm not a boy . You 've been around with dilettantes so long you do n't recognize seriousness when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious people who are funny , Dickie ! Look at Bunny . KURT faces her.Yes. look at him ! An epitome of the brainless muddle of contemporary life , of all the self-seeking second-raters who rise to power and wield power . That 's why I 'm going to do him in . The phone rings  --  for a moment they pay no attention to it . It 's the most beautiful chance anybody ever had and I 'd just like to see them try and stop me . Phone keeps ringing . MARION answers it . MARION Yes yes certainly . To KURT  --  a bit surprisedIt 's for you She hands him hand-receiver . KURT takes phone and talks from rear of sofa.Yes . Hello sure . Well , what about it ? Oh , you want to talk to me about it , do you ? I thought you would I 'll be around sure so long . He hangs up . They 've begun ! He is almost gay with the heady scent of battle . MARION What do you mean ? KURT That was my chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kinnicott 's begun to put the screws on him . He 's going to ask me to kill it . All right  --  I 'll kill it ! p. 102 MARION faintly.I ca n't believe it . KURT Neff 's had a call from the father-in-law MARION Did he say so ? KURT No , but you can bet he has ! MARION I must say this puts my back up KURT I 'll make a fight for it to keep my job . But if he 's stubborn I 'll tell him to go to hell  --  and go to a publisher with your manuscript . And if I do n't get quick action that way I 'll publish it myself  --  I 'll put every penny I 've saved into it MARION But why should you ? Why does it mean so much to you ? KURT Do you think I 'd miss a chance like this ?  --  It 'll test the calibre of our magazines , of our press , our Senators , our morality MARION All on account of my poor little story  --  how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again.Who 's Vicki ? MARION aware of it.An old friend to whom I 'm dedicating the biography . KURT Yeah ! Sits beside her , then speaksWhere is he now ? p. 103 MARION He 's dead . A pause . She gets up and crosses to center . I 've always rather despised these contemporary women who publicize their emotions . Another moment . She walks upstage . She is thinking aloud . And here I am doing it myself . Too much self-revelation these days . Loud speakers in the confessional . Why should I add to the noise ? I think , as far as this story is concerned , I 'll call it a day , Dickie . KURT What ! MARION Let 's forget all about it , shall we ? KURT If you let me down now , I 'll hate you . MARION Will you ? Why wo n't you take me into your confidence then ? Why wo n't you tell me about yourself ? What are you after ? KURT after a moment of inhibition decides to reveal his secret dream.My ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out everything there is to know about the intimate structure of things . I want to reduce the whole system to absurdity . I want to laugh the powers-that-be out of existence in a great winnowing gale of laughter . MARION That 's an interesting research . Of course it strikes me it 's vitiated by one thing  --  you have a preconceived idea of what you will find . In a research biased like that from the start you are apt to overlook much that is noble and generous and gentle . p. 104 KURT challenging and bitter.Have you found generosity and gentleness and nobility ? MARION A good deal  --  yes . KURT Well , I have n't ! MARION I 'm sorry for you . KURT You need n't be . Reserve your pity for weaklings . I do n't need it ! MARION Are you so strong ? A pause . KURT does n't answer . How old are you , Dickie ? KURT turns away.What difference does that make ? MARION Who do you live with ? KURT I live alone . MARION Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are your parents ? KURT They 're dead . MARION Long ? KURT My mother is . I hardly remember her . Just barely remember her . MARION Your father ? He does n't answer . Do you remember your father ? KURT in a strange voice.Yes . I remember him all right . p. 105 MARION What did your father do ? KURT He was a coal miner . MARION Oh ! Wo n't you tell me about him ? I 'd like to know . KURT I was a kid of fourteen . There was a strike . One day my father took me out for a walk . Sunny spring morning . We stopped to listen to an organizer . My father was a mild little man with kind of faded , tired blue eyes . We stood on the outskirts of the crowd . My father was holding me by the hand . Suddenly somebody shouted : " The militia ! " There was a shot . Everybody scattered . My father was bewildered  --  he did n't know which way to turn . A second later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was still holding my hand . He died like that . A moment . He concludes harshly  --  coldly  --  like steelAre there any other glamorous facts of my existence you would like to know ? MARION stirred to her heart.You poor boy I knew there was something I knew ! KURT hard and ironic.It 's trivial really . People exaggerate the importance of human life . One has to die . Turns to herThe point is to have fun while you 're alive , is n't it ? Well , you 've managed . I congratulate you ! p. 106 MARION her heart full.Dickie darling  --  why are you so bitter against me ? Why against me ? KURT Do you want to know that too ? Well , it 's because His voice rises . She suddenly does n't want him to speak . MARION Hush , dearest  --  hush  --  do n't say any more  --  I understand  --  not any more His defenses vanish suddenly . He sinks to his knees beside her , his arms around her . KURT Marion , my angel ! MARION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . TIME : Late afternoon . Two weeks later . The telephone is ringing as the curtain rises . There is a moment and MINNIE enters and crosses to rear of the table , rear of the sofa left . She picks up the receiver . MINNIE speaking into the phone.Hello.  --  No , Mr. Kurt , she 's not yet back . Vot ? You 're not coming home to dinner ? !  --  But I 've made the Pfannkuchen you like  --  Vot ?  --  You 're tired of my damn Pfannkuchen  --  She shouts angrily . Every night I make dinner and you and Marion go out !  --  I 'm not yelling  --  Vot ? Vot shall I tell Marion ?  --  Vot ?  --  Doorbell rings . Vait  --  vait a minute .  --  Someone 's ringing . She puts the receiver on the table and goes to the door . MINNIE shows in LEANDER NOLAN , who is followed by ORRIN KINNICOTT , who is a big , well-developed Southerner , about fifty-five , with a high-pitched voice . He is a superbly-built man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is a fine figure of a man , impeccably dressed in formal afternoon clothes . NOLAN to MINNIE , who has preceded him into the room.Did Miss Froude say she was expecting us for tea , Minnie ? p. 108 MINNIE No , Mr. Nolan . She did n't say nothing to me . NOLAN Not even when she 'd be back ? MINNIE hangs up coats.No . She just went out . NOLAN All right , Minnie . We 'll wait . MINNIE Yes , Mr. Nolan . She is about to go out into kitchen when she remembers that KURT is on the telephone . She picks up the receiver and saysHello  --  Mr. Kurt  --  you dere ?  --  Good-bye ! She then hangs up the receiver and exits left . KINNICOTT querulously . Sits on sofa right.Did you tell her four o'clock ? NOLAN Yes . I told her . NOLAN 'S manner with his father-in-law-to-be in this scene conveys the beginnings of a secret irritation , an inner rebellion . KINNICOTT Does she know I 'm a busy man ? NOLAN gloomily.She 's not impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters . I 've dealt with ' em before Bad  --  he sniffs the air of the room  --  bad air . Rises  --  tries to open window , fails , sits on window seatBet she 's underexercised. p. 109 NOLAN On the contrary  --  she 's radiantly healthy ! KINNICOTT Cosmetics , I bet ! These fly-by-night characters . NOLAN very irritated.Why do you keep calling her a fly-by-night character ? She 's nothing of the sort ! KINNICOTT crosses to NOLAN.Look here , Leander . NOLAN Well ? KINNICOTT Have you been entirely frank with me , in this matter ? NOLAN Of course I have . KINNICOTT cryptic.About the past  --  yes . But I refer to the present . NOLAN I do n't know what you mean . KINNICOTT I think you do know what I mean . Sometimes the way you talk I suspect  --  I suspect , Leander  --  that you are still in love with this woman . NOLAN Nonsense ! I simply tell you that she 's not a fly-by-night character . That does n't mean I 'm in love with her ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You 've discussed this with Slade ! p. 110 KINNICOTT She 's discussed it with me . She 's no fool , that girl . She 's noticed things lately . NOLAN What things ? KINNICOTT She says she talks to you and that you 're off somewhere else  --  dreaming . I tried to put her on another scent  --  but she was positive . She said : " Come on now , dad  --  do n't stall me  --  come clean ! " So I told her ! NOLAN You did ! KINNICOTT Yes . NOLAN When ? KINNICOTT Yesterday . Told her it happened fifteen years ago , that you were a naive young feller , did n't know anything about women , were just naturally taken in NOLAN That 's not true though . I was not taken in . KINNICOTT There you go again  --  defending the woman that 's endangering your entire career and using up my energies and yours when you ought to be home right now getting together with folks and thinking how to cinch this here election . Not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windowHow do you open this thing to get some air ? Sits on window seat NOLAN I do n't know . What did Slade say when you told her ? p. 111 KINNICOTT Nothin ' . You know Slade 's not the talkin ' kind . NOLAN Funny she did n't mention it to me last night . KINNICOTT Did n't want to worry yer probably all wool and a yard wide that girl is . I warn you , Leander , do n't tamper with the most precious and rare thing . NOLAN impatient of oratory.I know  --  I know . The point is  --  what are we going to do ? KINNICOTT ' Course I can get that young fellow  --  what 's his name ? NOLAN Kurt . KINNICOTT I can get him fired all right . From what you 've told me , Leander , he 's got something else up his sleeve . NOLAN I 'm afraid so . KINNICOTT That 's what I want to find out from your lady friend . And I 've got a pretty sure idea right now what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOLAN still not understanding.Money ? KINNICOTT Blackmail ! NOLAN You 're crazy ! p. 112 KINNICOTT You do n't know much about women , Leander ; when you know the sex as well as I do you 'll know that every woman has blackmail up her sleeve . NOLAN Look here , Orrin ! KINNICOTT rises , confronts NOLAN.Now , you listen to me for a moment , son . This situation 's gone about far enough right now . You 'd better make up your mind whether you want this black-mailing female or whether you want my daughter and you 'd better make it up right quick . NOLAN flaring up. I resent your tone , Orrin , and I wo n't be ordered around as if I were a high-grade servant ! KINNICOTT Now son , when you get control of your temper , and cool down a little bit , you 'll see that my ordering has n't been so bad for you . I 'll acknowledge you were mighty successful as a lawyer , but in politics , you 're nothing but a novice . NOLAN resentful.Am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all  --  I 've had to push and bolster you to get you where you are . NOLAN desperately.I know  --  I have every reason to be grateful to you  --  that 's the worst of it . MINNIE enters and crosses to hall door . Both men turn and watch to see who it is that is calling. p. 113 MINNIE speaking to someone at the door.Ja , Frulein ? SLADE off stage.Is Miss Froude in ? MINNIE Nein , Frulein . SLADE entering.Well , I 'll just wait . SLADE KINNICOTT is a good-looking , dark , high-spirited girl , a rather inspiriting and healthy example of the generation growing up on D. H. Lawrence.1 D. H. Lawrence , British author whose writings took a liberal attitude toward free love . To her father and NOLAN as she crosses downstage between themHello . NOLAN Slade ! KINNICOTT severely.Daughter ! What are you doing here ? SLADE Came to have my picture painted . What are you ? KINNICOTT Your coming here at this time is most inopportune , daughter . We are here on business . SLADE mischievously.I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Slade . I want you to meet the woman whom your father has just been accusing of the most reprehensible crimes ! p. 114 SLADE I 'm pretty anxious to get a load of her myself . Looks about the room taking it in and then sits on the left end of the sofa below the pianoNice lay-out . Gee , I wish I were artistic . What a lucky gal she is ! A paint-brush and an easel and she can set up shop anywhere in the world . That 's independence for you ! Gosh ! She looks about , admiring and envious . KINNICOTT Why must you come here to get your picture painted ? We have tolerable good artists in Knoxville . SLADE Well , if you must know I 'm very keen to have a heart-to-heart talk with my fianc 's old girl . Natural , is n't it ? KINNICOTT No , it is n't natural ! NOLAN crosses angrily to window and back toward KINNICOTT and sits down on stool right near sofa on which SLADE and her father are sitting.This is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think I did n't suspect something was up ever since Froude arrived here , you do n't know your little bride . Maybe I have n't been watching the clouds gather on that classic brow ! Where is my rival ? Do n't tell me she 's holding up two big shots like you two boys . KINNICOTT Slade , this is no time please leave us before she comes . p. 115 SLADE Not I ! Just my luck ; when a story is going to come out which has something in it I want to read , you two killjoys are going to suppress it ! NOLAN This is n't exactly a joke , you know , Slade . SLADE I mean it . KINNICOTT sadly.I 've spoiled you , Slade  --  I 've been too easy with you . SLADE At least I hope you 'll buy the manuscript . My God , father , I 'm curious . Ca n't you understand that ? I want to find out what Leander was like before he became ambitious . I 've a right to know ! This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leander , but it 's given me a kick out of you I did n't know was there ! How did she make you , Leander  --  that 's what I 'd like to know . You 've been pretty unapproachable to me but I sort of took it for granted National Figures were like that . Also I 'd gotten to the point when I was going to suggest that we break our engagement , but this little incident revives my interest . NOLAN furious.Indeed ! SLADE Yes indeed . Where is this woman ? What is that secret ? How to Make National Figures there 's a title for you ! KINNICOTT Slade , you 're talking too much ! Shut up ! p. 116 NOLAN rises and moves stool toward them a bit.No , she is n't at all . To SLADEIf your interest in me requires the artificial stimulus of an episode that happened twenty years ago SLADE leaning toward him.It requires something . NOLAN leaning closer toward her . The three heads are now close together , KINNICOTT 'S in the center.Does it ? SLADE It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were alone , was rather difficult . NOLAN starts to argue . KINNICOTT pushes them apart.Children ! Children ! NOLAN We 're not children ! To SLADEIf our relationship is so  --  SLADE Tenuous ? NOLAN . That it requires artificial SLADE Respiration ? NOLAN If it 's as bad as that then I think perhaps we 'd both better SLADE Call it a day ? You 'll need me in the Senate , Leander , to fill in the gaps when you get hung up in a speech . Consider carefully what you are discarding. p. 117 NOLAN If that is the case I tell you solemnly we 'd better separate now . SLADE mock tragedy.Father , Leander is giving your daughter the air . Do something ! KINNICOTT I do n't blame him for being irritated . You should not be here . Please go home . SLADE lights cigarette.Do n't worry , dad . I 'll get him back . KINNICOTT This is a bad mess , Leander . And I must tell you frankly that I do n't altogether approve of your attitude NOLAN And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours . KINNICOTT Is that so ! NOLAN I do n't like your tone in speaking of a woman with whom at one time I had a relation of the tenderest emotion  --  for whom I still have a high regard . KINNICOTT That 's evident anyway ! NOLAN When you apply to such a woman the terms you used before Slade came in , when you impute to her motives so base , you cast an equal reflection on my judgment and my character . SLADE And that , pop , is lse-majest. p. 118 NOLAN And it may be perfectly true , Slade , that knowing Miss Froude has spoiled me for the flippant modernisms with which you study . SLADE I 'm dying to ask her one thing : when you made love to her in the old days did it always sound like a prepared speech on tariff schedules ? KINNICOTT This is getting us nowhere . SLADE Well , dad , what do you expect ? Leander and I have broken our engagement since I came into this room . That 's progress , is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most unfortunate . SLADE Leander does n't think so . IronicallyHe 's free now to pursue the lady for whom he still has a high regard . RisesAre we no longer engaged , Leander ? NOLAN That 's not for me to say . SLADE rises and shakes hands with NOLAN.Gentleman to the last ! And at the very moment  --  KINNICOTT in despair  --  speaks as SLADE starts to speak.Slade , if you would only go home ! SLADE crosses left.Just at the very moment when I was saying to myself : Well , if a brilliant and beautiful woman who has played footie with royalty in the capitals of the world loved him , maybe there 's a secret charm in him that I 've overlooked  --  just when I was saying that and preparing to probe and discover  --  lightly  --  he gives me the air . Sits on sofa leftBy God , Orrin , there 's life for you . Bell rings . Ah , that must be my rival ! NOLAN gets up and fixes his tie , expecting MARION . But it is KURT who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white heat of anger. p. 119 KURT Well , gentlemen , I 'm not surprised to find you here ! Drops hat on model stand and comes downstage left NOLAN about to introduce KINNICOTT.How do you do , Mr. Kurt this is . KURT I can guess who it is . I can guess why you 're here . Having failed to intimidate me you are here to intimidate Miss Froude . SLADE rises , excited by this tempest . Well , I can advise you that you will fail with her too . NOLAN This is his usual style , Orrin . Do n't mind him . KURT I have just come from my office where I have been informed by Mr. Neff  --  SLADE stands below KURT  --  just behind him  --  watching him  --  whom you doubtless know , Mr. Kinnicott  --  that I could decide between publishing Miss Froude 's story or giving up my job . I invited him to go to hell . That invitation I now cordially extend to you two gentlemen . SLADE Why does n't somebody introduce me to this interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassed , but covers it in a gruff manner . He has actually not been aware of her in the room. p. 120 KURT I 'm sorry  --  I  --  I did n't know . SLADE Why are you sorry ? I 'm Slade Kinnicott . She gives him her hand . He takes it , limply . KURT All right  --  all right . He is disarmed and feels , suddenly , rather foolish . SLADE Leander , why have you kept me apart from this young man ? KURT I 'm sorry  --  I SLADE Nonsense . What 's your name ? KURT Richard Kurt . SLADE ' Go to it  --  Turns him toward others KINNICOTT impressively  --  interposing between them.You 're being very foolish , young man . KURT crosses toward them  --  to right of model stand.Possibly . NOLAN You ca n't argue with him . I 've tried it . He 's a fanatic . KURT But if you ask me I think you 're being very foolish . KINNICOTT who wants to find out what 's in KURT 'S mind.Are we ? How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parroting  --  crosses and sits on model stand . She is having a wonderful time.Yes , how ! KINNICOTT Oh , hush your mouth . KURT Because I 'm going to publish Miss Froude 's book myself . And I promise you that it 'll be the best-advertised first book that 's come out in a long time . SLADE Thank God ! Will you send me the advance sheets ? I 'll make it worth your while , Mr. Kurt . KINNICOTT I can see you are an extremely impulsive young man . Have you ever inquired , may I ask ? SLADE edges a bit closer to KURT.This is going to be dangerous ! Look out , Richard . NOLAN sits on stool , disgusted with SLADE . KINNICOTT smoothly.Have you inquired into the penalties for libel , Mr. Kurt ? KURT Libel ! You 're going to sue me for libel , are you ? KINNICOTT same voice.Yes . You and Miss Froude both yes . KURT Well , you just go ahead and try it , that 's all I can tell you . Go ahead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a charming position before those moral constituents of his , wo n't it ? Includes both NOLAN and KINNICOTTGo ahead and sue , both of you  --  sue your heads off ! I promise the two of you I 'll give you the fight of your lives ! p. 122 SLADE delighted.Good for you , Richard ! MARION comes in . She wears a long red velvet coat , and a little red cap stuck on the side of her golden head  --  she looks a little like Portia.1 Portia , the heroine of The Merchant of Venice , dressed for her role as lawyer . She is at the top of her form . MARION beaming with hospitality.Well ! How nice ! Minnie ! KURT goes upstage to right of MARION.This chivalrous gentleman has just been proposing to sue you for libel  --  he considers SLADE who rises and stands just below the model stand.I 'm Slade Kinnicott . MARION crosses downstage to her and they shake hands over the model stand.How very nice of you to come ! Turns and faces KINNICOTTIs this Mr. Kinnicott ? He bows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake hands . I 'm so sorry to be late . Waves hello to NOLANHello , Bunny . SLADE this is too much for her. Oh , my God  --  BUNNY ! She sits , overcome. p. 123 MARION to NOLAN.I 'm so sorry NOLAN glaring at SLADE.It 's all right , Marion ! MARION Has Minnie given you tea ? I 'll just Minnie ! MINNIE enters . Tea , Minnie , please . To the menOr cocktails  --  high-balls ? KINNICOTT I never drink alcoholic mixtures . NOLAN asserting his independence.I 'll have a highball ! KINNICOTT I must tell you , Leander , that I do not approve  --  NOLAN I 'll have two whiskies straight ! MARION Good ! Highball for you , Miss Kinnicott ? SLADE Thanks . MARION I 'll fix them myself , Minnie . Just bring us some tea , Minnie . KINNICOTT Nor do I wish any tea . KURT crosses down left.Nor do I. MARION Do you mind if I have a cup ? Do sit down , Miss Kinnicott . A tiring day . SLADE sits on model stand . MARION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring me a cup of tea  --  p. 124 MINNIE Ja , Frulein . RememberingA telegram for you , Frulein . MARION Oh , thank you , Minnie . Just put it there on the table . MINNIE leaves the telegram on the table rear of the sofa left and then exits left . MARION removes her coat and hat and crosses to rear of piano and starts to mix the highballs . Now then ! What is all this nice cheerful talk about a libel suit ? That 's what they 're always having in England , is n't it , on the least provocation . It 's when you 've circulated a lie about someone  --  defamed someone  --  maliciously  --  is n't it ? Bunny ! She gives NOLAN his two drinks . He takes them and returns to his position . MARION picks up the other glass and crosses with it to SLADE . Now then  --  whom have I defamed ? KURT You 've defamed the Honorable Mr. Nolan ! MARION hands drink to SLADE.Have I ? Oh , I am tired . She sits on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Kinnicott ? SLADE sauntering over.Thanks . She sits by MARION on the sofa . MARION You 're very pretty . p. 125 SLADE more warmly.Thanks ! MARION Bunny , I congratulate you . I 've heard so much about you , Miss Kinnicott . And I think it 's very gracious of you to come and see me . If Bunny lets me I 'd like to paint you  --  MINNIE enters  --  and give you the portrait for a wedding-present . She rises and crosses to above model stand to get cup of tea from MINNIE . MINNIE exits left . Thank you , Minnie . SLADE You 're very lovely . MARION Thank you , my dear . SLADE I ca n't tell you how curious I 've been about you  --  I  --  KINNICOTT This is all very well  --  but I 'm a busy man MARION looks at KINNICOTT as she crosses and sits right of SLADE . A moment , then MARION speaks.It seems so strange to see you with all your clothes on . It seems a pity  --  as an artist I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest development that I 've admired so often in The Body Beautiful . KINNICOTT That 's neither here nor there . MARION this is almost an aside to SLADE.It seems to me that it 's decidedly there . MARION and SLADE laugh quietly together. p. 126 KINNICOTT Slade , you 've upset everything by coming here . KURT comes forward . He has been eaten up with irritation that the superb indignation he felt should have been so dissipated by this cascade of small talk . He can stand it no longer . KURT crosses to right of model stand.If you understood better what these gentlemen mean to do ! NOLAN protests.It was n't my idea ! KURT You would n't be quite so friendly , Marion . MARION I could n't possibly be unfriendly to anyone so frank  --  and  --  and gladiatorial  --  as Mr. Kinnicott . KURT furious at her for not letting him launch into it.A libel suit ! MARION Oh , yes ! A libel suit ! It sounds so cozy . Sit down , wo n't you ? KINNICOTT sits on stool . A libel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? KURT The Honorable Nolan is going to sue you for libel . NOLAN I 'll punch your head if you say that again . KURT On the assumption that when you say in your story that you and he were lovers you are lying and defaming his character ! p. 127 MARION Dear Bunny , you must want to be a Senator very very badly ! NOLAN in despair.I never said it , I tell you ! MARION As a matter of fact , how could I prove it ? Come to think of it , are there any letters ? Did you ever write to me , Bunny ? NOLAN I do n't remember . MARION I do n't think you ever did . You see  --  we were always  --  during that dim brief period of your youth  --  we were always so close  --  letters were hardly necessary , were they ? Did I ever send you any letters , Bunny ? NOLAN I do n't remember , I tell you . MARION Neither do I. You might look around in old trunks and places and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature  --  I 'd love to read them  --  they 'd probably make wonderful reading now . Why is it that the things one writes when one 's young always sound so foolish afterwards ? Has that ever occurred to you , Mr. Kinnicott ? KINNICOTT I do n't admit the fact . MARION No . KINNICOTT No . I was looking over some old editorials of mine written in the depression of 1907 and they 're just as apropos today . I have n't changed my ideas in twenty-five years . p. 128 MARION Have n't you really ? How very steadfast . Now if the world were equally changeless , how consistent that would make you . To KURTWell , there is n't any documentary evidence . KURT It does n't matter . KINNICOTT As I said before , this is getting us nowhere . Do n't you think , Miss Froude , that the only way we can settle this is by ourselves ? She smiles at him . I can see you 're a sensible woman . MARION I am very sensible . KINNICOTT And you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't have to talk to him at all if you do n't want to . MARION smiling at KINNICOTT.But I 'd love to . I 've always wanted to meet Mr. Kinnicott . There are some questions I want very much to ask him . To the othersYou can all wait in my bedroom . It 's fairly tidy , I think . SLADE to KURT  --  Rises , crosses to him. Why do n't you take me for a walk , Richard ? MARION as KURT hesitates.Do that , Dickie . A walk 'll do you good . p. 129 NOLAN What 'll I do ? MARION as if it were another dilemma.You wait in my bedroom . Aware suddenly of the proprietiesNo  --  in Minnie 's bedroom . It 's just next to the kitchen . NOLAN defiantly.I will ! He exits into bedroom . KURT sulky  --  he does n't quite like the turn affairs have taken.We 'll be back in ten minutes . SLADE as they go out.You ca n't tell , Richard . SLADE and KURT exit . MARION draws a deep breath . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mature people talking freely to each other after they 've gotten rid of the children . MARION they cross to sofa left.Now we can talk ! It 's funny  --  I feel we 've put the children to bed and can have a quiet talk after a lot of chatter . KINNICOTT Same here ! MARION Please sit down . They do . KINNICOTT I feel sure you and I can come to an understanding . p. 130 MARION I 'm sure we can . KINNICOTT Now then , about this little matter of the story  --  You wo n't mind if I speak very frankly to you ? MARION Not at all . KINNICOTT You see , Miss Froude MARION Oh , call me Marion . Everybody does . KINNICOTT Thanks . Call me Orrin . MARION All right , I 'll try . Not a very usual name . Orrin . Fits you . Strong . Rugged strength . KINNICOTT Thank you . MARION You 're welcome . What were you going to say when I interrupted you ? You were going to say something . KINNICOTT I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I expected to meet . MARION No ? What did you think I 'd be like ? Tell me  --  I 'd love to know . KINNICOTT Well , you 're kind of homey  --  you know  --  folksy MARION Folksy . SmilesAfter all , there 's no reason I should n't be , is there ? I 'm just a small-town girl from Tennessee . I sometimes wonder at myself  --  how I ever got so far away . p. 131 KINNICOTT positively.Metabolism ! MARION I beg your pardon . KINNICOTT I always say  --  take most of the bad men and most of the loose women and correct their metabolism and you 'll correct them . MARION Really ? KINNICOTT seriously.Absolutely . Trouble with our penology experts  --  so-called  --  is that they 're psychologists  --  so-called  --  when they should be physiologists . MARION That is very interesting indeed . Have you ever written anything about that ? KINNICOTT Off and on . MARION Any definitive work I mean ? KINNICOTT I 'm considering doing that right now . MARION Oh , I do wish you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's own body , is n't it ? I get so impatient of myself sometimes  --  of my physical limitations . My mind is seething with ideas but I have n't the physical energy to go on working . I tire so quickly  --  and often for no apparent reason . Why is that , Mr. Kinnicott ? KINNICOTT Defective  --  She says at same time with him p. 132 MARION &amp;MDASH ; KINNICOTT Metabolism ! KINNICOTT Tell me  --  MARION What ? KINNICOTT Do you eat enough roughage ? MARION I do n't know , offhand . KINNICOTT firmly.Well , you should know ! MARION As I say , Orrin  --  one is so ignorant of these fundamental things . KINNICOTT definitely aware now of MARION as a personal possibility.I can see this , Marion  --  if you 'd met me  --  instead of Leander  --  when you were a young girl  --  you 'd have been a different woman . MARION I 'm sure I would . Imagine  --  with one 's metabolism disciplined early in life  --  how far one could go . KINNICOTT confidentially offering her hope.It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KINNICOTT Er . He drops his voice still lower . What are you doing tomorrow evenin ' ? MARION I  --  I 'm free . p. 133 KINNICOTT same voice.Will you have dinner with me ? MARION I 'd be delighted . KINNICOTT Fine ! Then we can go over this little matter of the story and Leander quietly . Leander is n't strong on tact . MARION You know , some men are n't . KINNICOTT You and I can make a friendly adjustment . MARION What fun ! They chuckle . KINNICOTT What time shall we meet ? Say seven-thirty ? MARION Let 's say eight do you mind ? KINNICOTT My apartment ? MARION If you like . KINNICOTT Here 's my card with the address . It 's a roof apartment . I 'm a widower . MARION Irresistible combination ! KINNICOTT By the way  --  MARION What ? KINNICOTT Do n't mention our little date for tomorrow evenin ' to Leander . MARION rising . No , I agree with you . I do n't think that would be wise . p. 134 KINNICOTT nodding trustingly  --  rises.Fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . KINNICOTT Oh yes eight . A moment 's pause . He visibly preens before her , buttoning his beautifully-fitting frock coat across his heroic chest . MARION approving.Wonderful ! Wonderful ! KINNICOTT going toward bedroom . To her. Do you mind if I Leander MARION Not at all . KINNICOTT I 'll take the load off his mind . He goes out . She ca n't believe it . The whole situation is so fantastic . She flings off her little red cap and shaking with laughter collapses on the couch . MINNIE comes in to clear up the tea-things . MARION as MINNIE enters.It 's too good to be true , Minnie . MINNIE Vat is too good to be true ? MARION I must write some of it down before I forget it The bell again . MARION gets up to make notes on her script.  --  A widower 's penthouse  --  With an irritated sigh MINNIE goes out to answer bell . MARION sits at desk jotting notes very fast . SLADE and KURT come in . KURT is morose . MARION gets up to greet them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total loss . MARION laughing.What did you expect ? SLADE Well , a little encouragement  --  just a soupcon MARION Dickie 's very serious . SLADE How did you come out with dad ? MARION Wonderful ! I 'm crazy about him ! SLADE But he got you to renege on the story MARION Well , he thinks so . However , we 're going to discuss it tomorrow evenin ' . SLADE Thought he 'd date you up  --  could tell by the way he eyed you . MARION He 's going to teach me how to live in a state of virtuous metabolism . SLADE Oh ! Do n't you believe it ! Dad 's an awful old chaser . MARION rather shocked.Slade ! SLADE amused.Are you shocked ? MARION You make me feel a little old-fashioned . KURT is intensely irritated by this conversation. p. 136 KURT Where are they ? MARION They 're in there sitting on Minnie 's bed . Orrin is probably telling Bunny that everything 'll be all right . SLADE sits left of MARION.Marion . MARION Yes . SLADE What is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , KURT goes to sofa down left and sits staring moodily into a gloomily-tinted future . MARION He 's a dear  --  there 's something very touching about Bunny  --  sweet SLADE Were you in love with him once ? MARION Yes . SLADE Are you in love with him now ? MARION No . SLADE in a whisper.Are you in love with  --  someone else ? MARION a moment 's pause.Yes . SLADE I thought you were . He 's mad about you .  --  I envy you , Marion . MARION Do you ? Why ? SLADE You 're independent . You 're  --  yourself . You can do anything you like . p. 137 MARION Yes , I know . But it 's possible one can pay too much for independence . I 'm adrift . Sometimes  --  you know what seems to me the most heavenly thing  --  the only thing  --  for a woman ? Marriage , children  --  the dear boundaries of routine SLADE If you had married Bunny he would 've given ' em to you . He 's still in love with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell him ? MARION parrying.What are you talking about ? SLADE I wish we could change places , Marion . You can with me but I ca n't with you . KINNICOTT and NOLAN come in from the bedroom . KINNICOTT is at his most oleaginous . KINNICOTT to KURT.Well , young man ! Over your little temper ? KURT No , I 'm not over it ! What makes you think I 'm over it ? KINNICOTT Well , well , well ! As far as I 'm concerned there are no hard feelings . I 'm going to call up your employer myself when I get home and tell him , that as far as you are concerned , to let bygones be bygones . Ca n't do more than that , can I ? KURT To what do I owe this generosity ? p. 138 KINNICOTT To the fact that in Miss Froude you have a most gracious friend and intercepter . He gives MARION a gallant , old-South bow . Miss Froude  --  this has been a very great pleasure . MARION rises  --  with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her his hand.Auf wiedersehen . MARION Auf Wiedersehen . Ich kann es kaum erwarten ! 1 Ich erwarten ! I can hardly wait ! KINNICOTT pretending to understand.Yes , oh , yes , yes , of course ! To SLADECome , Slade . He goes to hall door . SLADE All right , dad . To NOLANComing  --  Bunny ? NOLAN Well , yes  --  I 'm coming . SLADE to NOLAN.You want to stay . Why do n't you ? KINNICOTT quickly marshaling his little following with a military precision.I think Leander had better come with us  --  p. 139 SLADE to MARION.Good-bye , Marion . MARION to SLADE.Good-bye , Slade . They shake hands . Come to see me . SLADE Thanks , I will . KINNICOTT smiles at MARION.Miss Froude ! Bows to MARION who returns his bowCome , daughter . Come , Leander . To KURTGood-bye , young man . No hard feelings . KURT glares at him . KINNICOTT again bows to MARION . Miss Froude ! MARION is startled into still a third bow . He calls without looking backCome , Slade ! Leander ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then crosses to MARION.I 'll be back . MARION When ? NOLAN In a few minutes . All right ? MARION I 'll be in . He goes out quickly . MARION is in wonderful spirits . She runs to KURT and throws her arms around him . Oh , Dickie . That Orrin ! That Orrin ! p. 140 KURT What did you say to him that put him in such good spirits ? MARION Everything I said put him in good spirits . I ca n't wait for tomorrow evenin ' . I ca n't wait for that dinner . It 'll probably consist entirely of roughage  --  just imagine ! He 's the quaintest man I ever met in my life . He 's too good to be true . Sits right of KURT KURT Well , he may be quaint to you but to me he 's a putrescent old hypocrite and I do n't see how you can bear to have him come near you , say less go to dinner with him ! MARION sobered by his intensity.You 're so merciless in your judgments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really . KURT And so do you me . MARION I do ? That 's absurd ! KURT You do . It 's like thinking a person fastidious and exacting and finding her suddenly MARION Gross  --  indiscriminating ? KURT bluntly.Yes ! MARION You know , Dickie , I adore you and I 'm touched by you and I love you but I 'd hate to live in a country where you were Dictator . It would be all right while you loved me but when you stopped . p. 141 KURT It would n't make any difference if I stopped  --  I should n't be that kind of a Dictator MARION glances at him . Almost sadly.I see you 've thought of it . KURT inexorably.What did you say to Kinnicott ? MARION Your manner is so  --  inquisitorial . I have n't been able to get used to it . KURT angry and jealous.I heard you tell Nolan to come back too How do you think I feel ? MARION Dickie ! KURT When Nolan sat there and told me he had been your lover , I felt like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't forget that yet you encourage him , and Kinnicott  --  My God , Marion , you seem to like these people ! MARION I certainly like Slade . KURT Well I do n't . She 's conceited and overbearing . Thinks she can have anything she likes because she 's Orrin Kinnicott 's daughter . MARION That 's where you 're wrong . She 's a nice girl  --  and she 's unhappy . KURT bitterly.Maladjusted , I suppose ! p. 142 MARION Dickie , Dickie , Dickie ! Studying you , I can see why so many movements against injustice become such absolute  --  tyrannies . KURT That beautiful detachment again . He is white with fury . He hates her at this moment . MARION with a little laugh.You hate me , do n't you ? KURT Yes ! Temporizing with these ! Yes ! I hate you . She says nothing , sits there looking at him . These people flout you , they insult you in the most flagrant way . God knows I 'm not a gentleman , but it horrifies me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if the final insult to their pride and their honor could only come from the discovery that this stuffed shirt Nolan had once been your lover ! The blot on the immaculate Tennessee scutcheon ! Why , it 's the God-damndest insolence I ever heard of . And yet you flirt and curry favor and bandy with them . And you 're amused  --  always amused ! MARION Yes . I am amused . KURT I ca n't understand such ! MARION Of course you ca n't . That 's the difference  --  one of the differences  --  between 25 and 35 ! p. 143 KURT If the time ever comes when I 'm amused by what I should hate , I hope somebody shoots me . What did you tell Kinnicott ? MARION Nothing . Simply nothing . I saw no point in having a scene with him so I inquired into his favorite subject . He gave me health hints . He thinks tomorrow night he will cajole me  --  through the exercise of his great personal charm  --  into giving up my plan to publish . KURT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you would n't ? MARION Because I wanted to avoid a scene . KURT You ca n't always avoid scenes . That 's the trouble with you  --  you expect to go through life as if it were a beautifully-lit drawing room with modulated voices making polite chatter . Life is n't a drawing room ! MARION I have  --  once or twice  --  suspected it . KURT rises.What the devil are you afraid of , anyway ? I had a scene today in the office and I was prepared for one here  --  until you let me down  --  MARION lightly.Prepared ? I think you were eager . KURT What if I was ! It 's in your behalf , is n't it ? p. 144 MARION Is it ? But you forget , Dickie . You 're a born martyr . I 'm not . I think the most uncomfortable thing about martyrs is that they look down on people who are n't . Things  --  looks at himAs a matter of fact , Dickie , I do n't really understand . Why do you insist so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't it be better to give it up ? KURT Give it up ! MARION Yes . KURT You 'd give it up ! MARION Why not ? KURT obeying a sudden manic impulse.After all this  --  after all I 've  --  ! Oh , yes , of course ! Then you could marry Nolan and live happily forever after . And be amused . Good-bye ! He rushes up center , grabs his hat from the stand as he passes it , and continues on out the door . MARION rises and runs after him.Dickie ! KURT going out the door.Good-bye ! MARION Dickie ! Dickie ! The door slams . MARION walks back into the room . A pause . She stands still for a moment ; she shakes her head . She is very distressed and saddened and a deep unhappiness is gnawing in her heart , an awareness of the vast , uncrossable deserts between the souls of human beings . She makes a little helpless gesture with her hands , murmuring to herselfPoor Dickie ! Poor boy ! In its Italian folder the manuscript of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She picks it up  --  she gives the effect of weighing the script in her hand . Slowly , as if in a trance , she walks with the script to the Franklin stove downstage left and sits before it on a little stool . She opens the manuscript and then the isinglass door of the stove . The light from behind it glows on her face . She looks again down on her manuscript , at this morsel of her recorded past . She tears out a page or two and puts them into the fire . A moment and she has put the entire script into the stove and she sits there watching its cremation . The doorbell rings . As MINNIE comes in to answer it , she shuts the door of the stove quickly. p. 145 MARION It 's probably Mr. Nolan . MINNIE goes out . MARION makes a visible effort to shake herself out of her mood . NOLAN comes in followed by MINNIE who crosses stage and goes in the bedroom left . NOLAN is excited and distrait . NOLAN Hello , Marion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for rushing in on you like this I MARION I 've been expecting you . NOLAN That 's right ! I told you I was coming back , did n't I ? MARION You did  --  yes . NOLAN I must have known  --  I must have felt it  --  what would happen . Marion MARION Bunny dear , you 're all worked up . Wo n't you have a highball ? NOLAN No , thanks . Marion . MARION Yes , Bunny NOLAN I 've done it ! MARION You 've done what ? NOLAN I 've broken with Slade . I 've broken with Kinnicott . I 've broken with all of them . p. 146 MARION You have n't ! NOLAN Yes ! I have ! MARION Oh  --  oh , Bunny ! NOLAN sits.When Orrin told me what you 'd done  --  that you were going to give up the story . MARION But I  --  NOLAN He said he was sure he could get you to do it . It all came over me  --  your generosity  --  your wonderful generosity . MARION beyond words.Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of laughing despair . He hardly notices her attitude . He rushes on . NOLAN I realized in that moment that in all this time  --  since I 'd been seeing you  --  I 'd been hoping you would n't give up the story , that you would go through with it , that my career would go to smash . MARION faintly.Bunny . NOLAN I saw then that all this  --  which I 'd been telling myself I wanted  --  Slade , a career , Washington , public life  --  all of it  --  that I did n't want it , that I was sick at the prospect of it  --  that I was n't up to it , that I was scared to death of it . I saw all that  --  and I told her  --  I told Slade . p. 147 MARION You did ! NOLAN Yes . MARION What did she say ? NOLAN She said she knew it . She 's clever , that girl . She 's cleverer than I am . She 's cleverer than you are . I 'm afraid of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know I seem stupid and ridiculous to you  --  just a Babbitt  --  clumsy  --  but I love you , Marion . I always have  --  never anyone else . Let me go with you wherever you go  --  lest she think it a " proposition "  --  I mean  --  I want to marry you . MARION I 'm terribly touched by this , Bunny darling , but I ca n't marry you . NOLAN Why not ? MARION If I married you it would be for the wrong reasons . And it would n't be in character really  --  neither for me  --  nor for you . Besides that , I think you 're wrong about Slade . She 's very nice , you know . I like her very much . NOLAN I do n't understand her . I never will . MARION If you did you 'd like her . You better have another try . Really , Bunny , I wish you would . NOLAN Letting me down easy , are n't you ? MARION It 's Slade 's manner that shocks you  --  her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you think you do  --  I 'd really shock you very much , Bunny . p. 148 NOLAN I 'll risk it . Marion , my dearest Marion , wo n't you give me some hope ? MARION sees she must tell him.Besides ,  --  I 'm in love . NOLAN stunned.Really ! With whom ? MARION Dickie You see , Bunny He ca n't get over this . There is a considerable pause . You see , Bunny NOLAN slowly.Do you mean that you and he  --  you do n't mean that ? MARION Yes , Bunny . NOLAN dazed.Are you going to marry him ? MARION No . NOLAN he passes his hand over his forehead.This is a shock to me , Marion . MARION gently.I thought it only fair to tell you . NOLAN in a sudden passion.You  --  you . He feels like striking her , controls himself with difficulty . Anybody else but him ! p. 149 MARION You see , Bunny . NOLAN after a moment  --  rises.Sorry ! Funny , is n't it ? Joke , is n't it ? MARION I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always will be . That kind of tenderness outlasts many things . NOLAN blindly.I 'll go on , I suppose . MARION Of course you will ! NOLAN crosses to model stand and gets his hat . KURT comes in . There is a silence . NOLAN forces himself to look at him . KURT does not meet his glance . KURT is white and shaken  --  not in the least truculent . Good-bye , Bunny dear . Bunny ! NOLAN Yes , Marion . MARION Will you do me a favor ? NOLAN Yes . MARION Will you please tell Mr. Kinnicott for me  --  that as I 've been called out of town suddenly  --  I ca n't dine with him tomorrow night . You will see him , wo n't you , and you 'll tell him ? NOLAN Yes . NOLAN leaves . A silence again . Suddenly KURT goes to her , embraces her with a kind of hopeless intensity. p. 150 KURT in a whisper , like a child.Please forgive me . MARION Yes . KURT These moods come over me  --  I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I love you so much  --  I ca n't bear to . MARION I know , dear  --  I know . KURT I 'm torn up all the time  --  torn to bits . MARION I know , dear KURT When this is all blown over  --  could we  --  do you think MARION What , dear ? KURT If we could only go away together , the two of us  --  somewhere away from people , by ourselves ? MARION Why not , Dickie ? We can go now , if you want to . KURT Now ? But you 're crazy . How can we possibly leave now  --  with the book . MARION Dickie  --  I must tell you . KURT You must tell me what ? MARION You must be patient  --  you must hear me out for once  --  you must try to understand my point of view . She leads him to sofa left and sits beside him. p. 151 KURT What do you mean ? MARION You know , Dickie , I 've been very troubled about you . I 've been sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't mean It was just that MARION No , you do n't understand  --  it was n't your anger that troubled me . It was ourselves  --  the difference between us  --  not the years alone but the immutable difference in temperament . Your hates frighten me , Dickie . These people  --  poor Bunny , that ridiculous fellow Kinnicott  --  to you these rather ineffectual , blundering people symbolize the forces that have hurt you and you hate them . But I do n't hate them . I ca n't hate them . Without feeling it , I can understand your hate but I ca n't bring myself to foster it . To you , this book has become a crusade . It could n't be to me . Do you know , Dickie dear  --  and this has made me laugh so to myself  --  that there was nothing in the book about Bunny that would ever have been recognized by anybody . It was an idyllic chapter of first love  --  that 's all  --  and there was nothing in it that could remotely have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much the better  --  ! Think of the spectacle they 'll make of themselves  --  destroyed by laughter . p. 152 MARION I do n't believe in destructive campaigns , Dickie outside of the shocking vulgarity of it all  --  I could n't do it  --  for the distress it would cause . KURT You 've decided not to publish then . MARION I 've destroyed the book , Dickie . KURT You 've destroyed it ! MARION Yes . I 'm sorry . KURT You traitor ! MARION It seemed the simple thing to do  --  the inevitable thing . KURT What about me ? You might have consulted me  --  after what I 've MARION I 'm terribly sorry  --  but I could n't possibly have published that book . KURT in a queer voice. I see now why everything is this way . MARION I could n't ! KURT Why the injustice and the cruelty go on  --  year after year  --  century after century  --  without change  --  because  --  as they grow older  --  people become  --  tolerant ! Things amuse them . I hate you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 153 MARION I know you do . You hate my essential quality  --  the thing that is me . That 's what I was thinking just now and that 's what made me sad . KURT Nothing to be said , is there ? RisesGood-bye . MARION rises.All right ! KURT starts to go . She calls after him , pitifullyWo n't you kiss me good-bye ? KURT All right . MARION goes up after him . They kiss each other passionately . MARION whispering to him. I would try to change you . I know I would . And if I changed you I should destroy what makes me love you . Good-bye , my darling . Good-bye , my dearest . Go quickly . KURT goes upstage and exits without a word . He is blinded by pain . Dickie ! MARION is left alone . She is trembling a little . She feels cold . She goes to the stove and sits in front of it , her back to it , trying to get warm . She becomes aware that her eyes are full of tears . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you worried from anything , Marion ? MARION No , Minnie . I 'm all right . p. 154 MINNIE I tink maybe dot telegram bring you bad news . MARION Telegram ? What telegram ? MINNIE Dot telegram I bring you . MARION Of course  --  I have n't even  --  vwhere is it ? MINNIE gets telegram from table rear of sofa left and hands it to MARION.There it is ! MARION Thank you , Minnie .

Listen ! Reads telegram aloud to MINNIE " Can get you commission to paint prize winners Motion Picture Academy  --  wire answer at once . Feydie . " Hysterically grateful for the mercy of having something to do at once , of being busy , of not having time to thinkSomething always turns up for me ! Pack everything , Minnie . I want to get out right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat and coat and then runs to the stairs left . MINNIE Do n't you tink you better vait till tomorrow ? p. 155 MARION No , Minnie . Once the temptation to a journey comes into my head I ca n't bear it till I 'm on my way ! This time , Minnie , we 'll have a real trip . From Hollywood we 'll go to Honolulu and from Honolulu to China . How would you like that , Minnie ? She starts up the stairs . MINNIE for her , enthusiastic.Fine , Marion ! Calls after her as she runs upstairsDot crazy Kurt he goes vit us ? MARION as she disappears into her bedroom .
