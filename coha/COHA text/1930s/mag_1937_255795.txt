No ! No ! No ! <P> <P> Sirs : <P> You just said something about Legionnaires by the thousand sleeping on sidewalks , gutters and hotel lobbies during the GREAT convention . Damn it , sir , that is going a little too far . <P> To say that they slept in lobbies is not so bad . But to state that they sought sleep , wonderful sleep , in gutters when there were neat sidewalks alongside is an insult . <P> Put yourself in a Legionnaire 's place . Let 's assume that for any one of several reasons you suddenly find the arms of Morpheus more attractive than those of Gipsy Rose Lee . There you are , with a gutter and a sidewalk both beckoning to you . The gutter is damp and filthy . The sidewalk is nice and clean , with only a few programs and torn newspapers to mar its perfect score . . . . Certainly your good sense would make you pick the sidewalk . . . . O.K. Then why assume that a Legionnaire has any less sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us boobs and fake heroes , and we take it . But insult our intelligence by saying that we sleep in gutters , and we rear ourselves up on our toes , swing our canes , and exclaim : No , No , a thousand times No . <P> G. D. HOUTMAN Chairman <P> Delaware County Committee <P> Media , Penna . <P> Sirs : <P> Last year I received your miserable , smart-aleck publication as a Christmas present . The only reason I am not cancelling this subscription now is that I do not care to make you a gift of the few cents you would gain by my so doing . <P> I admit I expected some of your smart-aleck criticism of the Legion convention , but not the scurrilous , lying attack upon the Legion which appeared in your issue of Oct. 4 . ... <P> <P> BERNARD M. SNYDER <P> Hudson , N. Y. <P> <P> Sirs : <P> . . . Every time I see the dirty digs at World War veterans , I am tempted to cancel my subscription . But that action would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyway , why jump on the World War veterans ! Are they any worse than veterans of other wars or any other group of Americans when in Convention ? . . . <P> You say 110,000 Legionnaires attended , including their families , with 30,000 paraders from Pennsylvania alone . Now , do n't be absurd . There are 47 other States and with an average of a thousand to each State , which average is low , there were at least 77,000 in the parade alone . The Digest states 85,000 and the Pathfinder , 300,000 , and any way you look at it , your figures on the attendance are wrong . I do n't care whether one veteran or a million marched . What I am interested in is truthfulness and accuracy as far as is humanly possible . . . . <P> Even if you feel we deserve censure at times , why do n't you give us a boost when we deserve it . Why do n't you tell about our Child Welfare , which is recognized as outstanding . How about our Flood Relief last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign against isms , contrary to the theory of our Government ? Who are the leaders in every community and States , entirely out of proportion to our numbers ? . . . <P> All in all , your policy is unfair , untruthful , lacking in all the essential facts and is the symbol of a warped personal feeling . . . .
