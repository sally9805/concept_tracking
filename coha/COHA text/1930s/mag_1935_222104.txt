These men . . . are actuated in their adoption of a program of policies by the highest motives of patriotism and love of country . <P> With this preamble , the American Legion 's Commander James Raymond ( " Ray " ' ) Murphy in person slapped on President Roosevelt 's desk last week his Legionaries ' legislative demands . No. 1 : Bonus cash on the line . <P> Hefty Commander Murphy refused to tell newshawks what he and Legion Lobbyist John Thomas Taylor had heard from the President 's lips . Significantly , however , he declared : " We are not even discussing the possibility of a veto . " <P> Having frittered away their energies last session in wrangling over whether Bonus cash should be raised by orthodox Treasury methods ( Vinson-American Legion bill ) or by printing greenbacks ( Patman-Veterans of Foreign Wars bill ) , cash-hungry veterans saw their hopes go glimmering when the Senate by eight votes sustained President Roosevelt 's veto of the Patman bill ( TIME , June 3 ) . When Legionaries roundly hissed Bonuseer Patman at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wranglers began to see the light of compromise . <P> Ten days after Congress meets on Jan. 3 the Patman bill is scheduled to be brought to the House floor . Similar preferential position awaits the Bonus in the Senate , as the result of an Administration deal with Bonuseers on the tax bill ( TIME , Aug. 26 ) . Last week it was reported that the Legion and the VFW. having agreed to get behind a single bill with no mention of money-raising methods , had also won Representative Patman over to their view point . But no matter which way Bonuseer Patman twists , observers agreed that with elections only a few months distant a Bonus bill satisfactory to the veterans will be rushed through Congress with enough votes to carry it over the strongest veto message President Roosevelt might compose . Speaker of the House Joe Byrns put himself on record last week as expecting the Bonus to pass both Houses by Feb. 1 . Unofficial wiseacres predicted that within three months War veterans ' pockets would jingle with $2,000,000.000 in cash . <P> Probable next policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and love of country ' ' : pensions for all veterans .
