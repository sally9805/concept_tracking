On campuses throughout the land , the nation 's reckless collegians madly gulped almost every conceivable object . Beginning with goldfish ( TIME , April 10 ) , they went on to swallow worms , magazines , snakes ( see p. 2 ) , footballs , gunpowder . <P> Finicky collegians started more appetizing games . At San Jose ( Calif . ) State College , for example , Jack Baldwin wagered he could catch and kiss 20 co-eds in 30 minutes , fell six short . Soon San Francisco State College 's Marshall Blum claimed a record : 40 kisses in five minutes . At New York University Co-ed Dorothy McDonald kissed 36 boys in four and a half minutes . San Diego State College 's Joseph Arthur Pranis staged a three-day hunger strike to bring gulpers " to their senses . " At week 's end he was thwarted by what seemed an ultimate - horror - in - gulping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kappa Phi 's John Poppelreiter , surrounded by admiring fraternity brothers , wrapped in lettuce and swallowed five live baby white mice .
