Five-Year-Hope <P> In London last week , the delegates of 27 States who recently met at Evian-les-Bains to discuss aiding European refugees set up their new permanent bureau . Earl Winterton , lofty Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster , was elected chairman. * His first job was to hear complaints from Britain 's own dominions . The Northern Rhodesian Legislative Council , spokesmaned by Sir Leopold Moore , angrily protested a rumor that 500 German Jewish families would be sent to settle in Rhodesia . " Why , " exploded Sir Leopold , " can we not have instead 500 British colonists who are not Jews ? " <P> Speaking for the U. S. , Delegate Myron C. Taylor estimated that in the case of Germany alone some 650,000 persons ( Jews , part-Jews classed as non-Aryans , and persecuted Catholics ) face ejection , not to mention possible Jewish emigrations from Poland , Hungary , etc . At the present rate of refugee departures from Germany , declared Mr. Taylor , it would take 16 years for all the refugees to leave . He therefore urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeding departures from Germany that the exodus will be complete within five years . <P> Few of the other delegates made helpful suggestions . French Delegate Senator Henry Brenger explained that France , which has taken in the bulk of refugees who have fled Germany , now finds she has " arrived practically at the point of saturation , which permits her no longer to receive further refugees without upsetting the equilibrium of her social structure . " M. Brenger cried : " The hunting of a man , confiscation of his property , a concentration camp beyond which there is only the graveyard as a horizon-all this is contrary to human dignity and can result only in the catastrophic disturbance of relations between nations ! " Such language was not calculated to soothe Adolf Hitler , whose help would be most useful in getting Jews out of Germany . Already forbidden to take money with them , German Jews were recently forbidden by new Nazi decrees to take even their household goods and movable possessions . They were ordered to pay on such goods as jewelry , furs and furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barred German dealers from bidding on goods auctioned by non-Aryans , and provided that if a Jew , having failed to sell goods at auction , offers them for sale a second time but fails to find a private buyer , they should automatically be forfeited to the State . Why the Nazis went to this length was not apparent , since it would have been more in accord with Aryan forthrightness simply to order Jews to stay and starve or emigrate naked . <P> Meanwhile , Czechoslovakia also reached the refugee saturation point . She announced that a batch of 400 Austrian refugees who had been allowed temporary refuge in the country would be forcibly driven back into Germany at the first opportunity . Working in the dead of night , Czechoslovak police took 15 such refugees to a remote spot on the German border , and drove them over undetected by German frontier guards . Prepared for the worst , the Bureau last week tentatively added 60,000 Italian Jews to its list of potential refugees .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
