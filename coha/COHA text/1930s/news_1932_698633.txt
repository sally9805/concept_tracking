txt The prospects of success of the Disarmament Conference have indeed brightened . But we would do well to lay down some rules for judging the success or failure of the conference . What should be accounted success ? What should be deemed failure ? In the first place it can not be stated too clearly that by success is not meant the immediate reduction of armaments by any particular percentage . By failure is not meant a lack of agreement to adopt an arbitrary figure . These arithmetical tests are delusive . They will be useful in summing up the practical results of the conference , but they are not in themselves the criterion . I hear , for example , the somewhat simple view expressed that if the conference agrees on a 25 per cent cut all round it will have achieved its object , whereas if it does not it will have fallen short of reasonable expectations . But on what authority is the value of the conference to be so measured ? For my part , after carefully estimat : - ing the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only test should be a moral test , not a mathematical test . Great Variance in Situations It is surely indisputable that in present circumstances the geographical and political positions of the various nations are vastly different and can not be compared . Some nations have good reason to take precautions . Other nations are not in the slightest danger of attack . Some nations have been unilaterally disarmed to a considerable degree . Other nations have voluntarily brought down their armaments to a relatively low level . It is , generally speaking , unsatisfactory to refer to the terms of the treaties . Disarmament is something to be considered in itself and not in reference to sonic earlier text This is not a legal matter . It is a matter of good sense and good will . Yet we may note in passing that the Versailles Treaty which promised disarmament did taste into account the different situations of the various countries . That text should not be cited merely because it is a text , but because it is a valid expression of sound sense . We can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply a rule of thumb . Minimum of National Needs The real test of success or failure will be the revelation or the non  --  evelation of a desire and of a will to regard national needs at as low a level as possible . If the conference can dissipate sonic of the fears and Stispicions that may give rise to a race in armaments , and can , accordingly , begin a movement for the reduction of armaments , it will be a success whatever figures are formally adopted . If , on ? the other hand , there is an insistence on leaving relative strengths unimpaired and unchanged , although some nominal reductions are actually made , the conference may be a failure in that it has not dissipated fears and suspicions and a corresponding rivalry in armaments . This point is extremely important . It is moral rather than material disarmament which is wanted ; for material disarmament will necessarily follow moral disarmament . The conference should not aim at finality . Success will be the opening ' of a door to disarmament . which will reveal another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should put the world on the right path  --  the path to an ideal .
