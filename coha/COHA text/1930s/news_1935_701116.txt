txt Andrew W. Mellon denied from the witness Stand today that the Treasury Department , which he headed for eleven years , served him as a school for mastering the art of circumventing the income tax laws he was sworn to enforce . Robert H. Jackson , chief counsel for the government , which is seeking to collect more than $3,000,000 in back taxes and penalties from the 80-year-old financier , sought to demonstrate to the Board of Tax Appeals that such was the case ? that one of the country 's richest men used his high public office for private gain . It was a cool and collected witness who faced the suggestion and repudiated it . The episode came toward the close of his second day as a witness , and Mr. Mellon seemed to enjoy the part he was playing in the hearing after six weeks of . passive participation in a proceeding which he initiated to clear his name from the stigma of the charge of fraud as much as to protect his millions . Intersperses Witticisms . Reputedly a close-mouthed man , aloof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interspersing his testimony with pleasantries and witticisms at which he laughed as heartily as any in the crowded Federal hearing chamber where he is having his day in court . Declaring that he knew of no man who had a greater stake in Pittsburgh  --  the great% industrial city which he saw grow from the thriving little river town  --  Mr. Mellon asserted that he had as well a sentimental attachment for the city of his birth . There was no other reason , he said , why the great Aluminum Company of America , the Koppers Company and the Gulf Oil Company , all corporations in which he is heavily interested , should have their headquarters here . They were here , he testified , because of the love that he and his brother , the late R. B. Mellon , felt for their home town . He told of his desire to see that his daughter , Mrs. Ailsa Mellon Bruce , was well provided for while he still lived  --  a desire which , he revealed , almost caused ? him to decline former President Hoover 's appointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Voice Quavers as He Talks of Son . His voice quavered and he blinked beneath his bushy white eyebrows as he told the board and the court room crowd of his dream that his son Paul one day would take his place at the head of the house of Mellon . Over and over he reiterated that already Paul is showing a promising interest in the world of large affairs . It was not necessary for him to inculcate the " family tradition " in his son , for " Paul is very receptive " to his wishes and suggestions , although at one time , the witness said , he did not discuss business affairs much with the young man who now is on a wedding trip abroad , " because youth does not care to discuss such things any more than is necessary . " Ordinarily Mr. Mellon speaks with deliberation , but the words fairly tumbled from his mouth when he undertook to outline the manifold duties he had as Secretary of the Treasury , a post which he held through the administrations of Harding and Coolidge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only was he too busy to make any research into the schemes taxpayers devised for outwitting the tax collector , he declared , but he was too busy to pay much attention to his own affairs , which he said he left almost wholly in the hands of his brother and the capable , mild-mannered Howard M. Johnson , his financial secretary . As if He Had " Left Everything . " So complete was his " divorcement " from business upon his entry into President Harding 's Cabinet in 1921 , Mr. Mellon said , that it was as if he had " died and left everything . " " To whom ? " interjected Mr. Jackson . " To whomever I would have left it to , " answered Mr. Mellon , who has given about half of his $200 , - ' 000,000 fortune to his two children . Although much of Mr. Mellon 's testimony was digressive and not responsive to the questions of his cross-examiner , Mr. Jackson made no attempt to pin him down until late in the day , when he confronted him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income taxes without breaking the law . This document , it was disclosed dyer the objections of Frank J. Hogan , chief counsel to Mr. Mellon , was prepared for the Secretary of the Treasury , pursuant to his request , by David H. Blair , Commissioner of Internal Revenue during Mr. Mellon 's incumbency . Mr. Mellon , who previously had denied requesting any such memorandum , adjusted his eyeglasses and studied the paper carefully , identifying Mr. Blair 's signature . His hand trembled violently and he bent over to inspect the typewritten sheets more closely . Then he looked up and said : " I have n't the least knowledge of it ; and I do n't think I asked him to do it  --  not that I would n't have asked him to do it if there had been any occasion for asking . " " Have No Knowledge of It . " " It was taken from your files in the Treasury , " said Mr. Jackson , " and it says it was prepared pursuant to your request . " " I have no knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added eagerly : " It bears no date . How do you know it was prepared during my term ? It is merely addressed to the Secretary  --  Oh , yes , I see , it is signed by Mr. Blair ; well , of course , it was in my term . Still , I do n't think I ever saw it before . " Mr. Jackson had time to examine Mr. Mellon on only six of the nine methods of tax avoidance listed by Mr. Blair . The former Secretary of the Treasury testified that he had made use of five of them , even though he did not recall ever having seen the memorandum . He had not formed any foreign corporations , he said . He had sold securities solely for the purpose of offsetting capital gains and thereby reducing his tax liability . He had made gifts to members of his family to reduce his income , had placed a substantial part of his property in corporations and sold property on the instalment plan , receiving less than one-fourth of the value in cash  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter point Mr. Mellon hesitated , but Mr. Jackson reminded him of the 1,300 shares of Union Trust Company stock which Paul Mellon is buying on the instalment plan . Mr. Mellon receives about $180,000 a year on the principal of this $2,000,000 obligation and that sum is exempt from taxation . Mr. Mellon insisted that this was not done for the purpose of reducing taxes , however . The witness also admitted that he had availed himself of another one of the procedures listed in the memorandum prepared by Mr. Blair , that of receiving loans from corporations in which he was a stockholder , these loans being to all stockholders in equal proportion and thus tax-exempt . Earlier in the afternoon Mr. Jackson had sought to show that Mr. Mellon used his official position in another way to get expert advice on ways of minimizing his income-tax payments legally , by hiring Donald D. Shepard away from the Bureau of Internal Revenue . Mr. Shepard was a young lawyer in the office of Alexander W. Gregg , former Solicitor General of the Bureau of Internal Revenue . Mr. Shepard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , according to the evidence , in the formation of the Coalesced and Ascalot companies , which Mr. Mellon set up as holding companies for the fortune in securities he gave to his children . Contention of Government . It is the contention of the government that these two companies had another purpose : that of providing corporate aliases by means of which Mr. Mellon could sell stocks and bonds at a loss without losing control of them . Mr. Mellon said there were a number of matters that Mr. Shepard had to look after . Then for the first time since he took the stand he mentioned his plan to give his $19,000,000 art collection to the nation for the establishment of a national art shrine in Washington . " That was the first thing I put him at  --  studying the by-laws and organization of such galleries  --  the Metropolitan Museum and others . I had it in mind to go right ahead with the project , but other matters deferred that plan . " " Had Mr. Shepard any experience with galleries or museums ? " interposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for any purpose and it Just happened to be the first thing I had him do . " " Was the matter of taxes in-volved ? " " Not at all , " replied Mr. Mellon.
