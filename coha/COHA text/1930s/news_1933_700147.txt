txt Coordinator Eastman , a few days ago , adI dressing the Springfield ( Mass . ) Traffic Club and Shippers Advisory Board , gave his hearers 1 an outline sketch of the work upon which he is engaged . It is an impressive picture of varied and multiple activities , mainly in the way of research , and to those who do not know the Coordinator 's capacity for work it must seem an impossible burden for one man to carry . Mr. Eastman , however , thrives upon this sort of thing and possesses a pair of shoulders on which there seems to be always room for one more sack , and there need be no anxiety as to his ability to " chew " what he has " bitten off . " So far so good . The one supremely important activity in the list concerns itself with the recommendations which it will be his duty to make with respect to " permanent " railroad legislation in the next congressional session . It is not too much to say that the Coordinator will have more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other man in the United States  --  for that matter any single group of men . What his recommendations will be he does not tell us , for the ( good ) reason that he does not know , and will not know until he has collected and digested a great deal of information . Things Which Are Under Study He does tell us something of the things which are under study with a view to legislation . There Is. for instance , the matter of competing forces of transport and the need for their " regulation . " There is the matter of labor . There is the matter of regulation of railroad activities as such , apart from the question of competition . There is the matter of consolidation of existing systems and the " possible government participation in the management , ownership or financial reaponshility for these properties in all of the forms , major or minor , which such participation might take , " and so forth . The Coordinator says of this task : " Perhaps this recital of the studies which are under way-will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempted - that the - work Is likely to end up in confusion . My experience has been , however , that in such work the time comes when the issues resolve themselves and are found to be less complex than they at first seemed , if proper watch is kept for the forest instead of the trees . I believe that will be so in this case . " What Is the " Forest ' ! " An excellent simile , which , however , raises the question  --  what is the " forest " which is to be kept in view ? In plain English , what is to be our national concept of railroad transportation ? Are our railroads to be private enterprises or governmentally operated ? If privately operated , are they to be regarded as public servants or public enemies ? If regarded as public servants , are they to be encouraged or permitted to render the best service within the capacity of their nature , and are they to be paid a " fair wage " for their service ? In a word  --  what do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a good many years ' experience in the " regulation " of our railroads , and it has suyolrecily not eacaped his attention that the history of railroad regulation in the United States has been up to now , with very few exceptions , a history of regulation in character far more punitive than remedial . It has proceeded upon a principle of maximum requirements and minimum concessions . Doubts have in the great majority of cases been resolved against the roads . The law has ever been changed in the direction of greater " control " of management . In a word , while it is perhaps too much to say that the railroad has been frankly named and treated as a public enemy , it has , in fact , been treated in the main as a suspicious character , with a bad police record . Outlook for Government Ownership Whether or not the railroad has deserved this is a purely irrelevant question ; It is the fact which is important . The importance of the fact lies in that no system of privately owned transportation can continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its relations to the community , and no amount of " fair talk " will avail to obscure that conclusion . Now if , next winter , we are going to follow the precedent of the last five and forty years of " regulation " of our railroads and frame our new statutes in that spirit , the case for privately owned and operated railroads is hopelessly lost , and we may as well resign ourselves to government ownership and go to It once and for all . It is a change in our public and official " psychology " at least as much as a change of laws that Is needed in this matter . Unfortunately there is as yet precious little sign of any such change . It may be said that the railroads have not by their actions merited any such change . That , too , is irrelevant to the main point , and it is that point with which this writer is concerned . In what spirit are we going to legislate next winter ? That is now the real question in this matter .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
