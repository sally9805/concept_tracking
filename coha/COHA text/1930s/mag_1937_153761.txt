Last winter when business and stockmarket were soaring the balance of expert opinion held that stocks would suffer a spring slump , then recover to soar through the fall . Sure enough , the slump started in March , and , assisted by cold water from President Roosevelt , the crack-up of the British commodity boom and the unhappy state of the nation 's labor relations , reached bottom in June . For two months thereafter all was well enough , save for the extreme thinness of stock and bond trading . On Aug. 14 Dow-Jones industrial averages reached a high of 190 for the summer . Then , to the confusion of prophets , the whole market began slipping . By last week the market was back almost to the year 's lows-Dow-Jones industrials to 170 , utilities to 26.40 and rails actually penetrating their previous level of 50.17 to 46.89 . <P> The week before Labor Day traditionally marks an ebb of financial activity . Last week 's was not only ebb but neap tide . Trading in bonds on the New York Stock Exchange one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of August stock trading had totaled only 17,220,000 shares , smallest for that month since 1934 . Gloom hung so heavy in Wall Street that a seat on the Exchange sold for $75,000 , lowest price since April 1935 . On the sole million-share day last week 143 issues found new lows . On a recession not so great as that of last June , Wall Street morale touched a new low for recovery , and brokers began holding a premature wake over fall business prospects . <P> For this there was some justification . Steel mill operation held at 84% of capacity , a high figure but disappointing because a rise would be normal . The Iron Age warned its industry of ' ' revised estimates of the volume of autumn steel business . " Lumber output dropped more than seasonally , with orders last week running 20% less than for the same week last year . And commodity prices were down-winter wheat from a 1937 high of $1.29 to $1.02 a bu. ; corn from $1.16 to 97 a bu. ; cotton from nearly 14 to just above 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton loan policy . <P> Bearish as these statistics were , there were ample other indications that fall business would be good , that the trend is still upward , the trend of prices still toward inflation . Commodities might indeed be falling , but that was a logical outcome of bumper crops which would still leave farmers with the biggest income in years . Industrial and agricultural bank loans attained the highest figure in five years ( $620,000,000 ) , while airconditioning equipment production , cigaret sales and electric power output were at all-time peaks . Moreover , retail sales were zooming happily . Payrolls were still fattening . In view of such indices the prospect for fall business looked much like an oft-batted tennis ball which when dropped still has plenty of bounce , but not quite so much as human hearts have hoped for .
