A MODERN TRAGEDY-Phyllis Bentley-Macmillan ( $2.50 ) . <P> From their grimy Midland factory towns , the late Enoch Arnold Bennett and David Herbert Lawrence went on to bigger and brighter themes . Now Authoress Phyllis Bentley , whose background is the textile industry of Yorkshire 's West Riding , has taken up the smoky torch .

Foxy Leonard Tasker , an expert not only in manufacturing but in juggling a balance sheet , thought Walter would make a hard-working cat's-paw . With no trouble he lured Walter away from his job , set him up as figurehead of one of his own mills . For a while Walter thought he was being very successful . His quick rise brought him up the necessary social notches that separated him from the girl of his dreams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , he thought he ought to be happy . But Walter was no fool . He had not worked for Tasker long before he knew his boss was a crook . But by that time he was an accessory to many a damning irregularity .
