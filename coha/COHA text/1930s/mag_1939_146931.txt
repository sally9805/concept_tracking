Sabotage ( Republic ) starts out right innocently as that folksy love story about the young airplane mechanic and the traveling show girl in the quietest little Mid-American village in Hollywood . But when it shows U. S. average citizens organized by some mysterious agency to wreck airplanes , spoil machines , plant bombs by night in factories where the bomb-planters make their living by day , then uncorks a Hollywood program of vigilantes and kangaroo courts for dealing with them , Sabotage begins to look like the well-timed opening gun in a campaign to shoot for the witch-hunter trade . <P> When every military plane young Mechanic Tommy Grayson ( Gordon Oliver ) works on crashes , G-men arrest him on the day he is to be married to Show Girl Gail ( Arleen Whelan ) , force the plant to close . Tommy 's father , mild-eyed , poker-faced Major Grayson ( Charles Grapewin ) , native as a corn shuck , sets out to prove him innocent . By such slightly off-the-record stunts as burglarizing the plane factory and carrying off Tommy 's gauges to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his closet , the Major sleuths out a sabotage gang , finds most of them are just his sourer-faced neighbors . Whether they blow things up for Nazi gold or just for the heck of it remains as mysterious as where their bombs come from . With the help of three Spanish-American War cronies , World War veterans , other hastily mobilized vigilantes , the Major drags his suspects before a kangaroo court in the plane plant , makes them confess . <P> Good shot : swarming vigilantes marching on two levels ( across a high bridge and down a long flight of stairs ) that seems to come straight out of famed Bolshevik Director Sergei Eisenstein 's Potemkin . <P> Intermezzo ( Selznick-lnternational ) is a pleasant , leisurely filming of an off-key love episode in the life of a middle-aged man with a middle-aging wife ( Edna Best ) . In Hollywood 's current concern with musicians , it plays a thin , modest , molto andante treble to such thumping pictures as They Shall Have Music ( Jascha Heifetz ) , The Star Maker ( Walter Dam-rosch ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweden 's leading cinemactress , whose grave good looks , lit by a big-mouthed smile , make her one of the most promising Scandinavian exports since Garbo . <P> Though he fiddles away most of his time on tour , world-famous Violinist Holger ( Leslie Howard ) is just a homebody at heart until he meets Anita ( Ingrid Bergman ) , who is giving piano lessons to Holger 's eight-year-old daughter ( Ann Todd ) . Holger hears Anita play , falls in love with her . When he goes on tour again , Anita accompanies him , not only on the piano . But when Holger begins to long for home and daughter , Anita , realizing what the score is , runs off to Paris to study . As his daughter dashes across the street to greet homing Holger , a car hits her . Housebroken Holger and his wife are reconciled as a doctor reports the child will live . <P> Though Cinemactress Bergman is ballyhooed as something producers dream of-a star who can really play the piano-in Intermezzo neither she nor Leslie Howard plays a note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norma Boleslawski , wife of late , great Director Richard Boleslawski . Famed Violinist Toscha Seidel plays second fiddle for Leslie Howard .
