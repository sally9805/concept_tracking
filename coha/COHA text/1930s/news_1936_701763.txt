txt Leagues . The formation in increasing numbers of leagues for this or that purpose is due , no doubt , to a laudable desire on the part of often well-intentioned citizens to get something done . Close and earnest cooperation of the whole population is , of course , difficult to attain . But it must be apparent to many that such agitation often leads to overemphasis of the demands of mere groups , and the welfare and best interests of the whole body politic may not be served . These thoughts are prompted by the news of the launching of a publication intended to press the interests of the youth of America . A youth movement that we might all join would have something to recommend it , but I know of no good reason to emphasize the special need of youth for sane government , clean business , and so forth . These things are needed for all the people. ? ALLAN C. INMAN , Fitchburg , Mass.                  @ @ @
