txt The insistent efforts which the British National Government has been making to cut down its expenditures and thus to reduce what is almost universally regarded as the overwhelming burden of present taxation in Britain have received new stimulus from two official reports issued here . These reports are the work of committees comprised of members of municipal bodies . The committees were set up by Mr. 's Government last July with instructions to see what could be done to effect economies in this important branch of the administration . One of them under Sir William Ray took England and Wales as its province ; the other presided over by Lord Lovat , confined its attention to Scotland . Both committees have now reported that very substantial economies are possible . There are some reservations by individual members of the case of England and Wales , but these do not affect the main recommendations made . The Scottish committee is unanimous . The economies proposed cover a strictly defined field in that they refer solely to what can be saved upon local administration . The committees propose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 35,000,000 to ? 40,000,000 annually as compared with the actuals of 192930 , to take effect in the course of the next three years . The Scottish committee thinks that ? 3,383,300 in all could eventually be saved annually , in addition to material reduction in capital expenditure . One of the main sources of economy relied upon is a change in the existing system whereby the central Government contributes to municipal outlay . At present this contribution is generally dependent , not upon what the central Government can afford , but upon what the local body that is to be assisted decides to spend out of the municipal taxation raised by itself . The committees both advise that lump-sum grants should be substituted for percentage ones . Another economy they think possible is to substitute private for public enterprise in dealing with the housing problem . Drastic tightening up is also suggested of public expenditures upon education , roads and relief of distress of all kinds . The present proposals , like those put forward by the unofficial committee , are all highly controversial . The National Union of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw the whole influence of its 140,000 members against what it describes as " disastrous reversing of the engine . " The'Labor Party opposes the proposed cuts strongly . The Liberals are doubtful about the suggestions . Even the Conservatives are by no means unanimously in their favor , though this is more because they recognize the necessarily very unpopular nature of such expedients , than because any considerable proportion of them is not convinced of the desirability of going as far as may be politically practicable in the direction proposed . The net result nevertheless is to show that there is a strong consensus in favor of yet another turn of the economy screw despite the great electoral difficulties which such action involves . This is being taken notice of in official circles and is expected to become further apparent , alike in the Government 's housing and unemployment relief measures that are about to be introduced In Parliament , and in the Chancellor of the iiic.chequer 's budget proposals that come forward next spring .               @ @ @ @ @ @
