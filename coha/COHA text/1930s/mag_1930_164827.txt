An insignificant figure in Europe is Dr. Smeral of Prague . He sits with the Communist contingent of 30 Deputies . He can throw an inkwell clear across the arc of Parliament at the Conservatives with fair accuracy. * But nobody in Czechoslovakia would pay serious attention to Dr. Smeral if his wife 's maiden name had not been Dzhugashvili . <P> In Moscow the most potent Communist of all is Josef Vissarionovitch Dzhugashvili , whom the late great Lenin called for short " Stalin , " which means Steel . <P> Dr. Smeral 's wife is Steel 's sister . She was told to pack up and prepare to leave Czechoslovakia last week . The police who told her to pack told reporters that she had been caught " engaging in Communist agitation in the Ostrau industrial area . " <P> As boldly as Mr. Curtis of Washington ever fought for the rights of his sister Mrs. Gann , Dr. Smeral of Prague began to battle for his wife 's rights . " Scandalous ! " he cried , though no one heeded . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet the police now propose to expatriate my wife for advocating the doctrines of her own husband and his constituents . Scandalous ! " <P> * Books , inkwells and finally one or both of one 's shoes ( but these only in extreme cases ) are among the stock arguments of European Communist deputies , usually in so small a minority that unless they throw things they will not be noticed . Most notorious for ink fights is the Parliament of the German State of Prussia .
