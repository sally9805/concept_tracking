txt LOOKING TO 1932 . Relative Values of Gov . Roosevelt and Newton D. Baker Assayed . To the Editor of The New York Times ; Mark Sullivan in The Herald Tribune of today presents a strong case against Mr. Roosevelt as the Democratic Presidential candidate in 1932 . On the other hand , it appears from this article that the only reason for considering Mr. Roosevelt for the nomination is ' his ability to carry New York State . It is almost a truism that a disaffected people will vent their feelings upon the party in power , whether that party is responsible for existing conditions or not . The country has gone along during the past , two administrations quite serenely and guilelessly in the belief that the gods would not cease smiling on them . Quite suddenly they were brought up with a jolt . With that jolt came a crisis , not only economic , but an intellectual crisis as well . It was a jolt such as to force the people to think and ponder and to take stock , saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifest itself this November in the Congressional elections and in the next Presidential election . At these elections the people are going to look for real men and real leaders . They are showing today that they are no more satisfied with the platitudes and evasions of our present-day leaders . As a result it behooves both parties to put forward their strongest men in 1932 . A man whose sole qualification is his problematical ability to carry one State is not the leader the people are now searching for . So far as the Democratic party is concerned , they would be well advised to nominate a man who will not only carry his own State , but who is admired and respected in all the States . That man must be one who is not now actively engaged in politics . He must be a man who comes to the fore with a fresh mind and an honest and courageous attitude , and one who is not committed nor tied to entangling alliances . ( This , of course , refers to domestic , not foreign , matters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of War in Wilson 's Cabinet and referred to as the ablest man in Wilson 's Cabinet . Mr. Baker lives in Ohio , an important State . By birth he is a Southerner . He is not an extremist , and brings to any problem a clear , honest and analytical mind . His entire life has been a fight for liberalism . It is not essential that in order to win an election a man must carry New York . Wilson won without it . Mr. Baker can carry Ohio , the midWestern States , and . what is now important , the South . At the same time , while not of Wall Street , he is highly respected and admired by bankers throughout the country . He is a man who has received the acclaim of the leaders of our country , Republicans as well as Democrats . The South will not take kindly to a candidate from New York . The issue of Tammany is , rightly or wrongly , stronger today than it was in 1928 . If the Democrats are to win they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Baker is the best they have . ELLIOTT L. BISKIND . New York , Sept. 22 , 1930 . The Franklin Expedition Message . To the Editor of The New York Times : The Sir John Franklin Expedition 's message , facsimile of which is reproduced in THE : NEW YORK TIMES of Sept. 21 , undoubtedly was found by Lieutenant Hobson at Point Victory , northwest coast of King William Land , while scouting in advance of Captain McClintock , the latter being in command of an expedition aboard the steamship Fox , searching for traces of Sir John Franklin and his crew . Please note that the message was found during the month of May , 1859 , not in 1851 . In the latter year McClin- ' tock was a Lieutenant in the expedition commanded by Sir James Clark Ross , this being the third party sent out by England in the fruitless search for Franklin and his men . This information may be found in " The Great White North , " by Helen S. Wright , published by Macmillan . JOHN LEVY . Brooklyn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a Necessary Condition but a Maladjustment . To the Editor of The New York Times : Unrest , sometimes hostile , always disturbing , and often misled , Is daily increasing . Its causes are sharply discussed as world-wide , and every interest from politics and business and religion to tariffs and selfish greed and military oppression is in turn held responsible . The situation is obviously so grave in its extending and its intensity , and prognostications are so conflicting , that it is well worth while to call attention to an address delivered several months ago in San Francisco by Owen D. Young , than whom no American can speak with greater weight . He was summoned to take the place of the Secretary of Commerce of the United States in addressing a national body of business men . His time was short and he spoke with earnestness . He sought to go at once to the heart of our economic problems , recognizing their relation to all the others , and seeking the principles involved . Back of agricultural surplus or mining products or manufactured articles or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one principle prevails . The idleness of men who wish to work is the paralyzing blight that has fallen not only upon our economics but extends much further . It is absurd to speak of unemployment as a necessary condition in human society . It is nothing more than a maladjustment of its machinery . Charity is no remedy . The condition is a blot on our intelligenge . Its solution lies in larger views of the world 's needs . We are crowded back upon questions as to our attempted isolation . Are we eager to meet real problems ? Are we interested in others ' welfare , seeking both to supply and to receive what is really wanted ? Are we extending credit and seeking to improve others ' condition as for the benefit of both us and them ? Suspicion , want of sympathy , regarding others as dangerous competitors or essentially hostile  --  this is destructive whether at home or abroad . Isolation in our politics , exclusion in our tariff , cut the roots of our prosperity and simply support our blind self-interest . We hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , we say make money in marketing foreign securities here and sending American gold abroad . " The fact is that the international bankers , " says Mr. Young , " have done more in the last ten years and will do more in the next ten for the relief of our farmers than all government agencies that can be employed . " They have created the credit facilities which make sale of our wheat , cotton and the products of our factories and mines possible . This is the great service our surplus savings render to the prosperity of the country . Our international credit and finance must be steadily developed or our tariff must go if we expect to sell our supplies abroad . We are not , for example , " sending hundreds of millions of dollars " to develop electrical plants in other countries . But we are sending American goods and American brains to multiply others ' power of production , as we are multiplying and developing our own , and every wage earner , every farmer and every citizen of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sir Josiah Stamp , who says : " Where foreign obligations are coming to America , American surpluses ere being moved out . Instead of diminishing such movements , America needs right now to have them increased . " It will be the relief of any farm program . It will aid our industries . It will help unemployment . When our tariffs and our treaties are made in evidence of a true cooperative spirit ( we are under suspicion now ) we may look for effective results in all these directions , and for what is most important of all , a better spirit of all nations toward us and toward each other . The consuming power of the world has to be raised but little to take care of the surpluses which cause so much disaster to ourselves . He closes with this appeal : " We , more than any one in the world , need an era of good feeling . I beg the leaders , both in politics and economics , to cultivate it . He who makes bad feeling at home or abroad is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the cause of far worse things tomorrow . America has no use , and the world has not , for professional manufacturers of bad will . " As election days are at hand , and soon the irruption in force of Congress and the State Legislatures , this is a muchneeded appeal . Rev. HENRY A. STIMSON . New York , Sept. 24 , 1930 . " Alibi . " To the Editor of The New York Times ! In your editorial " Stern Measures in Russia " the following occurs : The present climax in the form of a widely ramified conspiracy against the nation 's food reserves suggests that the depletion of these reserves has reached a point where either a terrible warning or an impressive alibi is called for . I take it that you use the word alibi in the sense of a defense . It seems hardly necessary to point out that the word means only a defense which substantiates the absence of the person accused . " Alibi " is a Latin word taken bodily into the language and means " elsewhere . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , obviously , if a man was elsewhere when the crime was committed , he could not have committed the crime . I understand that the tendency for this misuse of the word alibi is spreading . It is quite as bad as the recent tendency , apparently happily averted , to use " meticulous " in the sense of " careful . " H. W. WOOTTON . New York , Sept. 26 , 1930.
