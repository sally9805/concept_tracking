Two years ago , as Svend Hansen , 40 , clipped hedges in an Irvington , N. Y. garden , he was stung on the leg by a bee , fell unconscious . Twelve hours later , Hansen was revived by adrenalin and artificial respiration . Last week , as he worked in the garden , he was stung on the neck by a bee . In 15 minutes Svend Hansen was dead . <P> Death from a bee sting is not rare . In 1936 , some 20 people in New England alone were stung , developed anaphylactic shock , died . Anaphylaxis is the opposite of immunity , results occasionally when a minute injection of some foreign protein , such as bee sting , makes the system extraordinarily susceptible to further injections of the same protein ( TIME , Aug. 31 , 1936 ) . Nobody knows exactly how bee sting works except that it may either kill or cure . <P> Medieval doctors used bee stings for arthritis , reasoning that the pain would make patients forget their aching joints . Modern doctors put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint with ethyl chloride , then applying artificial stings . Seventy-three out of 100 cases in New York Hospital were improved , said Dr. Jacques Kroner and associates in Current Medical Digest last month . Most of the cases showing no improvement were of long standing . <P> Theory of sting-treatment is based on the nonspecific protein principle . Arthritis is due to some poisonous protein , as yet undefined . The body stores up certain protein-digesting compounds which combat all poisonous proteins . An injection of foreign protein stimulates production of more defensive substances or enhances their strength .
