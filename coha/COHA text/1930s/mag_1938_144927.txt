With the French Chamber not due to reconvene until November , Premier Edouard Daladier last week announced that he would call an extraordinary session at " a fairly early date . " If the pugnacious Premier does so , then , as Chicago Daily News 's Edgar Ansel Mowrer cabled last week : " Everything seems to be set for one of the finest political battles France has witnessed , even in these eventful years . . . . By denouncing the 40-hour law ( TIME , Aug. 29 ) , without asking any so-called equivalent sacrifices from French capitalists , Premier Daladier smashes the Popular Front or what was left of it . " <P> Meantime , the Czech crisis and the ominous maneuvers of 1,300,000 German soldiers beyond the French frontier , placed French Communists and Socialists in a corner . Premier Daladier 's proposal to emasculate the 40-hour law was a slap in their face but they dared not set out to wreck his Cabinet . <P> Socialist leader , M. Leon Blum , whose party is the largest in the Chamber , was forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Populaire thus : " We do not seek to exploit against Edouard Daladier the difficulties which he has created for himself . The hour is too grave for that . But it is necessary that he be warned , if he has not already been . For repeal of the social legislation or for a reversal of attitude toward the working class , let him not count on the Socialist Party . " <P> Actually , the Premier had not called for outright repeal . What M. Daladier demanded fortnight ago and would ask the Chamber , if summoned , to approve , is supplemental legislation or administrative action to draw the sting of the 40-hour law . He was last week in such a position as Franklin Roosevelt might be , were the U. S. President to put Recovery ahead of Reform instead of Reform ahead of Recovery . Premier Daladier calculated that with living costs rising , millions of French workers would rather increase their earnings by working 48 hours ( with 10% overtime after 40 hours as offered by the Premier ) than cling to the 40-hour week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrespective of party , being able to see last week the military necessity of raising French production , thereby also strengthening France 's financial position by increasing Government revenues . <P> No. 1 French Labor Boss is portly Lon Jouhaux whose General Confederation of Labor boasts 5,000,000 followers . It is a trade union setup separate from the Socialist or Communist parties who eagerly look to it for votes . Last week M. Jouhaux , visiting in the U. S. , announced that so long as " repeal " of the 40-hour law is excluded and its " principle " maintained , French Labor will not attempt to bar modifications in the law . <P> " I say that France is lost if she does not work normally , " reiterated Premier Daladier last week as he reminded French Communists that in Russia there is no 40-hour week and Soviet workers toil much longer hours . <P> Under the force of that declaration the franc and French security prices firmed . M. Daladier meanwhile summoned a Ministerial Council to decide by what steps French workers will be started working 48 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
