Only last week did news get out about what happened to three British seamen who , one day early in October , took a taxi ride in Keelung , on the Japanese island of Formosa . At the end of the ride , the driver had his three passengers jailed on the charge of not paying their fare . When they resolutely denied the charge , four Japanese policemen held them down in turn while Japanese detectives beat each man in the face . Under this treatment two of the three British tars agreed to sign a declaration that they were guilty . The third , although his jaw was broken , still refused to sign . While police again held him down , a Japanese detective jabbed the point of a fountain pen deeply under the sailor 's nails and vigorously worked the fountain pen lever , shooting ink into the wounds until the sweating prisoner agreed to take the pen , sign a confession . <P> As this episode was reaching its climax , into the Keelung police station marched Lieut . T. A. Pack-Beresford of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's release . " I have obtained unquestionable proof , " he said , " that these sailors paid their taxi fare . " Snarled one of the Japanese police officers at Lieut . Pack-Beresford : " You say you 're a British officer . We say you 're nothing but a drunken sot . Get out of here ! " <P> When news of this reached Vice Admiral Sir Charles James Colebrooke Little , Commander-in-Chief of the China Squadron at Shanghai , he was so incensed that he postponed a scheduled trip to Japan . In London , news of the Japanese provocation at Keelung was kept secret long after the facts were known at the British Admiralty , and not a single Japanese newsorgan carried so much as a line on the Keelung ordeal by pen .
