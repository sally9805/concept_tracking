A LOST LEGEND " To begin with , I am not your dear , and in the second place , whether they get older or more sensible , it comes to the same thing . " " I apologize , Arachne , and I desire , with all possiblerespect , to know what it does come to . " " It comes , Smirt , to that never-ending spinning and that weaving and that embroidery , and to all the other things which I want to be doing . " But such notions did not delight Smirt . He said gravely : " These petty avocations are not suited to a person of your high origin , Arachne , in an old legend . You turn from romance to realism ; and to do that is unworthy . For one ought to cherish such beautiful nonsense , Arachne , and to keep faith steadfastly with all those impossible things which are not true , but which ought to be true . " Now the girl shook her head , replying : " I had a palace , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a palace , very long ago when Idmon reigned as a great prince in Lybia . To-day I desire only a home in which I may rule fondly . We will need also a small shop , to keep us going , and a few babies . Perhaps two boys and a girl would be better , just to start with . " " You have then , " Smirt inquired , " some marked out and , as the world averages , some fairly lucky man in mind ? " 40 " Him ! " she remarked , with disfavor . " No , I try not to think about him any more than I have to . Still , there does have to be a man to help me get the babies ; and besides that , somebody will have to tend the shop . " Smirt nodded affably . " I can perceive at least your point of view , Arachne . I can tender you , at any rate , my compliments on your directness . Whatever you were yesterday , to-day you have become what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been husband hunting in yonder ? " " You talk nonsense , Smirt , for it is well known there is no marriage or giving in marriage in that place behind me . " " You speak rather strangely , my dear  --  " " To begin with  --  " And at that , Smirt spread out both his hands , gaily remorseful . " I know . I apologize again , Arachne , and I remark only that I never saw a gateway so thick with cobwebsas is this gateway . It is more like the lair of a spider than it is like a gateway . Oh , but yes , beyond any doubt , Arachne , this is a strange gate through which you have walked into my dream . " " It very well may be , Smirt , for it leads to a strange place . " 41SMIRT " And what is that place called , Arachne ? " She told him . " Oh , but come now , " Smirt replied , laughing , " that is an irrational and an excessive name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ select residential section . Yet I have noticed that the retired business man is given to these outbursts of wild fancy . " " He is not retired from business , " the girl said ,  --  " as yet . " " And how is this unretiring person called ? " She told him that also . Smirt took her astonishing meaning . " You tell me that beyond this very wall He is to be found ! Oh , but come now , this must be seen to . I am grateful to you . And do not bother , my dear child , about your lost legend . You shall be restored in due course to all its glories , to its fine improbabilities , and to its bereaved inhabitants , who , I am sure , must miss you a great deal . Goddess or no goddess , it is not fitting that an unchaperoned young woman who began life as a mythical figure should be condemned to live at loose ends in the queer world which the newspapers tell about . I shall see to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and comingmuch nearer to him . " But , Smirt ,  --  you speak now of the impossible . " " The most of my doings , Arachne , are impossible. 42A LOST LEGENDI have often noticed it . My wife also refers to the fact , now and then , when something has occurred to upset her . " " And besides , " Arachne declared , " with that Jane of yours , who I am sure must watch you like a hawk , and probably has every reason to , what with the way you rattle on without giving the girl a chance to get in a word edgewise , and besides , even if I did ratherlike you , we do not really know each other as yet , ja Smirt , and it is not right for us to be together in this lonesome place , where there is no telling what impudenceyou might be up to , now it is growing darker and darker , with no one in sight of us , so that I would not be able to get any help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My dear young woman , " Smirt interrupted crisply , " do stop fiddling with my coat button ! and scat ! I mean , merely as a beguiling ingenue , in which role you are an agreeable commonplace . As an exile from romance , do you by all means remain here , at your proper distance , and accept my sworn oath to restore you to your lost estate in the lands beyond common-sense . " " I am grieved that you should have quite misunderstoodme , Smirt , for I am not in the least that kind of girl ; and I wonder whatever oath you are talking about ? " 43SMIRT " I am talking about that oath , Arachne , which I now swear by such matters as I cordially reverence . I refer to the acumen of Sir Thomas Browne , which first perceived that fine prose should be kept undebasedby deep thought ; to the theology of William Congreve , through which the unpardonable sin was found to be clumsiness ; and to the trimness of Robert Louis Stevenson , which completely baffles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pater ; to the higher carelessness of Saki ; and to the pleasant eddies , to the ampleness , and to the ultimate , the ineffable rightness , of every paragraph which was written by W. M. Thackeray . I refer also to the general contents of my own works . It is by these seven great mysteries that I now give you my oath , Arachne , to restore to you your lost estate in the lands beyond common-sense . In the mean while , you have told me that beyond this wall He is to be found in person ; and as a Peripatetic Episcopalian , I esteem it my plain duty to investigate , first of all , your surprising report . " With that said , Smirt pushed open the cobwebcoveredgate , and he went in to the All-Highest. 44 " He took a cymbal or bell , and rang therewith , as they use to ring to dinner in cloisters , at the sound whereof many creatures of divers kinds came down from the mount , some like apes , some like cats , some having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these creatures , all crying out ,  --  Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying war against them , or in adhering to their enemies , giving them aid and comfort . ' " EIGHTTHE ALL-HIGHEST CONFIDESThe All-Highest was a perturbed looking elderly gentleman , with a benevolent bald forehead and a superb white beard . It was slightly puzzling to observethat the All-Highest had two short horns , and that His right foot was like the hoof of a goat . It seemed odd also that in this place there should be nothing except opaque gray clouds , upon one of which the All-Highest was sitting , with a small book in His lap . But Smirt had other matters to consider , now that , after accepting one of Smirt 's cigarettes , the AllHighestwas speaking of George Bernard Shaw with virtually American disfavor . " For I do frankly consider , Smirt , that in this rigmarole about a Black Girl , which I have just been looking over , Mr. Shaw has disparaged My Book in a most unfriendly manner . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back comfortably upon his own cloud . " In the first place , the book  --  by which I do not mean Your Bible , but only The Adventures of the Black Girl in Her Search for God  --  has been out a great while . The cognoscenti have forgotten it very completely , for we do not regard gravely any book which antedates the present publishing season  --  " " Yes , but all our books come to us , Smirt , through the Salvation Army . People do not give them any new books . " "  --  For in our larger centres of culture , " Smirt continued , " books deteriorate rapidly . It is due , I am told , partly to the shallowness of modern culture and partly to the great amount of sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere of our cities , due to combustion  --  " " Yes , but , " said the All-Highest , " we were not talking about sulphur dioxide , and I do not see how we ever got on any such topic . " " In fact , All-Highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too inclusive mind , " said Smirt , frankly . " My thoughts for this reason embrace a wide variety of subjects with a quickness which many personsbefore You , sir , have found some difficulty in following  --  " " But we were not talking about your mind , Smirt . " " Now that You mention it , I believe You are right. 48THE ALL-HIGHEST CONFIDESI was saying that in the second place , Mr. Shaw must be regarded as one of the larger suns in the astronomy of English literature . " " Oh , but were you saying that , Smirt ? " the AllHighestasked , doubtfully ,  --  " for it seems an odd thing I did not hear you . " " Yes , " said Smirt , " one may no more deny the brilliancy of his genius than one may question the brightness of the sun . " Now the All-Highest clutched at His white hair with both hands and appeared slightly worried . " It was I who made the sun , Smirt . And it really is rather nice and shiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how we got to talking about the sun either , nor what it has to do with a most uncivil Irishman . " " I mean , All-Highest , that , after reading every word of the book now in Your hand , the thought occurred to me that upon at least two occasions the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature has been self justifying . I mean that after the 1930 award Mr. SinclairLewis responded in kind by giving to the Nobel Prize Fund an amount of invaluable advertising such as could not otherwise have been secured for double the money . I mean also that when the 1925 award was made to Mr. Bernard Shaw , as the author ' who had mostly contributed to the benefit of mankind during the preceding year , ' the fact that Mr. Shaw had pub-49SMIRTlished no book during the preceding year did cause a noticeable number of persons to interpret the seemingcompliment as a rather brutally accurate criticism of his later writings . " The All-Highest brightened so visibly that Smirt perceived he was on the right track . And Smirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find in the trumpery tale which has had the misfortune to displease You . A black girl sets forth to search for You , conveniently equipped with her Bible and a knobkerry  --  " " Only this morning , Smirt , I looked that up in the dictionary . It seems that a knobkerry is the Kafir equivalent of a shillalah . " " Quite so , All-Highest . Well , and as I was saying , she encounters You in a number of Your avatars , as You appeared variously to Moses , to Job , to Koheleth , to Micah , and to Jesus . All these does the black girl confound , seriatim , with the logic of Voltaire and the knobkerry of Mr. Shaw . Under the combined assaulteach one of Your avatars vanishes : and then  --  for we face here a flash of wit designed to captivate the village atheist  --  then likewise vanishes yet another bit of the Bible . " The old gentleman 's brow empurpled . He said : " It is to that , to that infamous slander , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist-50THE ALL-HIGHEST CONFIDESence , from time to time , that I do not at all mind being regarded as an obsolete superstition . A great many of my best friends are atheists . But I do resent any such jealous reflections on the enduring qualities of My Book , which is still selling excellently . " " As a fellow author , All-Highest , I delight to recognizein You the auctorial temperament , " said Smirt pensively . " As a fellow author I sympathize . I would but point out that after all these set-tos with You , sir , the black girl decides  --  yes , here it is , sir , at the bottomof page 74  --  that it is wiser to take Voltaire 's advice by cultivating her garden and bringing up her pickaninnies than to spend her life imagining she can find a complete explanation of the universe by laying about her with a knobkerry . ' " " And what , Smirt , do you infer from that ? " " I find in that sentence , All-Highest , something very like a formal palinode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , after laying about him for some and forty years with his own knobkerry  --  with the shillalah of a peculiarly fine intelligence  --  at least one free-thinker did not ever light on ' a complete explanation ' of any universe which was populated by both his admirers and Your admirers . I infer , in brief , from this sentence , that a free-thinker , think he never so freely , and for no matter how many decades , may come to notice that he does not know every-51SMIRTthing , not even at the comparative maturity of his later seventies , not even after some forty years of explaining everything with entire lucidity ; and I believethat every free-thinker is called upon by-and-by to face  --  if but obliquely , if only for an instant  --  this surprising outcome . " The All-Highest smiled . He declared , in halfchucklingprotest : " Come now , Smirt , that appears a great deal to deducefrom one sentence ; yet there may be something in what you say . And with your permission I will try another one of those excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smirt continued , " this is a state of mind which is reached sooner or later by the best informed . No one of us understands everything . I myself , for example , do not know what De Witt Clinton is thinking about so intently on this United States Internal Revenue cigarette stamp . I do not know why the clock on the front page of the Herald Tribune is set at twelve minutes after six ; nor why the King of Hearts and the jack of Clubs are the only male court cards not to have a mustache ; nor why a barber 's pole should always revolve its three-colored spiral downwards . What lightness , what clan , I have often reflected , sir , would be gained did this pole revolve more aspiringly upwards , with the appropriate optimismof its owner 's imaginings in regard to the52THE ALL-HIGHEST CONFIDESbenefits of shampoos and of singeing and of hair tonics  --  " " These are indeed deep mysteries , Smirt ; but we were not talking about shampoos , nor do I perceive what hair tonics have to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , I might mention , is still selling excellently . " " I was about to observe , All-Highest , that every at all rational free-thinker must come by-and-by to questionthe main article of his own faith , as it was defined by Mr. Gilbert Chesterton , in the remote days when Mr. Chesterton had genius , that because something has satisfied generations of men it must be untrue . With a little more experience , sir , one begins to suspectthat not even God can be disposed of by having at Him with a knobkerry . Under such treatment God vanishes , it is true : but it seems equally true that God may , just possibly , not find in that special form of address any reason for taking the addresser into His complete confidence . " After glancing everywhither , from under His shaggy white brows , and after making sure nobody was listening , the All-Highest spoke , in a confidential lowered voice , saying , " I admit , simply between ourselves , Smirt , that I do not find assault and battery an endearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 53SMIRT THE ALL-HIGHEST CONFIDES " And I promise You , All-Highest , " Smirt replied , reassuringly , " that I shall never approach You in this fashion . I confess to a little dubiety whensoever anybodytakes the bleak trouble to point out that through no human logic can be justified Your existence , sir . It occurs to me , I mean , that before advancingthis two-edged argument one would be called upon , first , to justify in logic one 's own existence ; and I have yet to meet the man who could do this . " " Come now , " said the old gentleman , as pleased as in the cliche is Punch , " but that is handsomely said . You speak well , Smirt , with a broad-mindedness which I do not often encounter among modern writers . Such speaking deserves a reward . So to you , Smirt , I will gladly explain everything . " Thereupon the All-Highest explained everything . He explained first about barbers ' poles , and about the King of Hearts ( but without committing Himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Clubs ) , and about the Herald-Tribune clock , and about De Witt Clinton . Then the All-Highest went on to explain His conduct of the universe : and Smirt listened with ever-growing dismay . " It does not please you , Smirt , to know that which no mortal man has known before you ? " " Oh , as to that , All-Highest , I appreciate Your confidence . I am honored , sir , I assure You . Nor is itquite my province , perhaps , to dictate to You in these cosmic affairs . " " Nevertheless , Smirt , do you speak your mind freely . " For an instant Smirt looked appraisingly at the gray cloudland which spread everywhither about them . All seemed most satisfactorily chaotic ; and yet , as Smirt now knew , there was no chaos anywhere . It was a defect over which Smirt perforce shook his head . Thereafter Smirt answered , with urbane self-restraint : " I can but say , sir , that Your methods are out-ofdate . The entire system is an anachronism . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canons of civilized art . " " I had feared , " the All-Highest replied , in an apologeticway , " that my methods could hardly hope for your approval . I have read your books , of course , with vast admiration and some unavoidable envy . You and I , Smirt , are creative artists who belong to different schools . You should allow for that fact beforedismissing My work as of no merit at all . " " But this work of Yours , All-Highest , as You have confessed to me , is government . It has a formal plan . It is rational . It involves the long ago exploded notionof a Personal Creator . All these circumstances have been revealed to me rather over suddenly ; andI will not deny that the shock to my feelings is considerable . Little did I think , sir , in the long while that I was a communicant of the Protestant Episcopal Church , and worshipped You every Sunday morning , that You actually did exist ; and far less did I suspect what You were up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I to-day perceive , has robbed human life of all lack of meaning . Your conduct of the universe , in brief , has amounted to a direct attackupon civilized art , in that You have left no target for irony . Yet what , I ask of You , what is to become of civilized art if all human life is not in truth a meaningless muddle which the artist observes with amused superiority ? " " Truly , Smirt , " the All-Highest replied , blushing , " I had not thought of that point . When I began My work there were no civilized persons by whose advice I might profit , and so I had to arrange matters more or less in the light of My own judgment . And you really ought to allow me credit for having done the very best I could . " Smirt gave over a moment to profound meditation . He said then : " All-Highest , I must be frank with You . To disparagethe work of any person to his face is a thanklesstask . I would prefer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is grave . And be-56sides that , mind You , I do find Your universe to be full of many quite charming bits . Your sunsets , for example , Your kangaroos , Your Gila monsters , Your Presidents of the United States , and many of Your thunderstorms , show that You have real imagination , in Your own grotesque vein . " " Come now , but that is generous of you , Smirt . Commendation from Sir Hubert Stanley , you know , is praise indeed  --  " " At character drawing , I admit , " Smirt went on regretfully , " You do not excel . Your men and women are not always convincing , and suggest that You have never probed deeply into human nature . Yet nobody has a universal genius , and for such defects it would be hypercriticism to blame You . " " You really think , then , that with continued application , Smirt , I have a possible future ? " " Oh , yes , Your work displays promise , distinct promise ! It is merely that You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , I must tell You , in plain words , that this underlying coherent plan ruins everything . Your work , I now discover , has a formal plot : and plots , sir , plots were discarded long ago by the small civilized minority of authors . " " But what do you suggest , Smirt  --  ? " After an instant 's reflection Smirt decided to apply the supreme test . He said , 57SMIRT " It may be , All-Highest , that I can best illustrate my idea by relating a rather amusing story which occurs to me . " " Then do so , Smirt , for My sense of humor is remarkablykeen . " " I hear and I obey , All-Highest . I obey the more readily because this droll anecdote concerns one of Your immediate servitors . I must tell You , then , that the next Bishop of Wyoming  --  " " That the what , Smirt ? " " I apologize , sir . I had quite forgotten that all time is coincident to Your perception , since You are omnipresent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for You to distinguish between the present bishop , the last bishop and the next bishop . But I do mean the next bishop . That is an essential point of the story . " " Very well then , Smirt . It sounds a little puzzling , I admit . . . However , you may go on . " " The next Bishop of Wyoming , " Smirt resumed , " was famous for his partiality to scrambled eggs , a dish of which , through circumstances irrelevant to the story , he had never partaken . So well known was this foible that , upon a warm afternoon in May , a noted actress inquired of him , in a spirit of banter , Can you inform me , sir , what is the current rate of exchange ? ' With a twinkle in his eye , the bishop repliedpromptly , Madam , no wise man leads a horse58THE ALL-HIGHEST CONFIDESto salt water . ' The lady 's confusion can be better imagined than described . " The All-Highest laughed heartily at this anecdote , and said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Smirt , that is an uncommonly good story . Yes , yes , to be sure ! And I only wish more of My bishops were as quick-witted . " At that , Smirt shook his head , and he sighed a little ; but he said nothing . " Nor do I deny , " the All-Highest continued , " that I might have profited by forming Myself after superiormodels . We will let the future test that : and meanwhile , in evidence of my gratitude , I present you with this coin , for a lucky piece . " " I observe , All-Highest , that it is a forty reis coin issued in 182o by John the Sixth , by the Grace of God , King of Portugal , Brazil and Algarvez . I duly admire his laurel wreath , so freely beribboned ; his snub nose ; and his three chins . But what shall I do with this coin ? " " Oh , you may do with it whatever you like , Smirt . " " I must do that in any case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That appears likely . It is not utterly certain , " replied the All-Highest , reflectively . " At all events , I would counsel you to preserve this coin , as a slight souvenir of our first meeting . And now , Smirt , as a59fellow author , let us have your advice . I was thinking that in view of the gratifying success of My Bookwhichis still selling excellently ,  --  I might do yet anotherbook , Smirt . I mean something really mature , this time , and something a bit more up-to-date than the Bible , you understand ... " Smirt said : " Come , let us raise for the All-Highest a lamentation . Begin , ye Muses , begin the funeral song : declare His folly unto the literati ; make plain His blunders among the book clubs . With His right hand and His holy arm He would write yet another book . " Thereafter Smirt paused ; and he shook his head in the while that , as became an American author , Smirt thought respectfully about the magnificos who in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Smirt comprehended , only too well , how inadequatemust seem the endowments and the creative powers of mere omnipotence when judged by Their standards . And furthermore , Smirt remembered what They invariably said about the next book by any author who had scored a popular hit with his first book . For this reason Smirt continued : " Begin , ye Muses , 6iSMIRTbegin the funeral song ; and narrate the curt epitaphs of the All-Highest in His second publishing venture . Between the Atlantic ocean and the Pacific ocean may His book hope to find no defender . It displays a sad falling off in inspiration , ' will the Boston Transcript remark . The Hartford Courant will color its drooling unfavorably . A rumor speeding among the heathen , even into Staten Island and Brooklyn , will proclaim that Soskin hath not read the like of this bosh in ten years ; yea , nor Kronenberger . In order to demolish this book will Granville Hicks yet again borrow the esthetics , the writings , and the urbanity , of Upton Sinclair . In the American Spectator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within mourning borders . Upon every Rural Free Delivery route , where the New Yorker delights the hired girl , even where the farmer 's wife takes in Vanity Fair , and vice versa , will peasantry scoff at this book . " Afterward Smirt said : " Begin , ye Muses , begin the funeral song ; for this book must die uncommended . Not even the facile fervors of William Lyon Phelps will acclaim this book surreptitiously , in his safe hidingplace , between the covers of Scribner 's Magazine . Gibes and a regal pitying , these only , must be the portion of this book . In Cincinnati Ted Robinson will smile upon this book with derision ; nor will Fanny Butcher avert her dispraise in Chicago . The62WHICH DEHORTShoroscope of this book will reveal the Kansas City Star as ill dignified , in the twelfth house , in the inimicalHouse of Fishes . In Denver will Caroline Bancroftconfess that the All-Highest fails to maintain His earlier promise . Nothing like so good as the Bible , ' will be the blunt verdict of the Portland Oregonian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the publishers of this book proclaim at utmost , speaking unveraciously . " Then yet again Smirt said : " Begin , ye Muses , begin the funeral song ; for the South alone will remainsilent and unscornful , not heeding this book , or any other book . All these testimonies have become for me a foreboding , and my counsellors likewise , now that I raise for the All-Highest a lamentation . " When he had ended his elegiac mingling of the Psalmist and Theocritus , Smirt remained silent  --  pondering , with a shared mind , upon the divine ways of book reviewers and upon the dilemma into which magnanimity had thrust him . And Smirt said : " This really does need considering . Beyond doubt it is my duty , as a fellow church member , to dissuade the All-Highest from this crowningfolly . To the other side , in this dream of mine  --  if it be a dream  --  I have promised to reinstate that little Arachne in her lost legend ; and a gentleman must keep his word , whether he be awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubling . To find the All-Highest a rather obtuse and bemuddled person had been natural enough , since some such person was deducible by logic from all prior acquaintance with His handiwork  --  provided , of course , that you could manage to reconcile your religious faith as an Episcopalianwith His actual existence . But to find Him endowed with the auctorial temperament was a discoveryof a distinctly upsetting kind , because you knew that temperament only too well : no universe was safe in its keeping . And to find Him on the point of publishing His second book , in an era so unfriendly to all which the nave old gentleman represented , was a situation to perceive which had enkindled Smirt with a patronizingand tender , and yet fierce , protectiveness . He must shield this pathetic blunderer , he must without any delay preclude the All-Highest , from that cruel and silken derision which the A11-Highest would incur , quite inevitably , by making any more revelationsto mankind in the present state of American letters . On the other hand , Smirt had given a plain promise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was his duty to look after her lost estate without any delay . And chronologically at least , Arachne had the prior claim . Yet Smirt was not twins . He could not simultaneouslybe in two places , upholding womanhood in one of these places , and protecting God in the other one of these places . It followed that the proper course for the Peripatetic Episcopalian , in these circumstances , required some calm thinking out . In the while that Smirt reasoned thus logically between the claims of his religious duties and the claims of his plighted faith , he saw that his admirers had pursued him . For now came running toward Smirt pell-mell the butcher , and the baker , and the candlestickmaker , and Tom , and Dick , and Harry , and Madame Quelquechose , and Senora Etcetera , and Lady Ampersand , and the world and his wife , and Anon , and Ibid , and Mrs. Murgatroyd likewise . All these cried out to the Peripatetic Episcopalian : " Do not leave us , Smirt ! We have a need of your nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour by hour we did yesterday . We have many common-sense tasks to discharge : they fill up each day utterly ; our reward is that we have food and sleep and our children and our portion of shallow laughter . We have our griefs also , but no deep griefs . The fixed round of our living prevents us from yielding up to66WHICH CONTINUES TO DEHORTany passion with our whole hearts . When love touches us , then must we yet think , with at least some part of our minds , about whether marriage would be quite sensible on our present income ; about house rents ; and whether it would be pleasant to have the beloved 's family in and about the house forever ? When death parts us from the most dear , then must we concern ourselves about a suitable plot in the cemetery , we must bargain with the mortician for the coffin . Also we must telephone to borrow black clothing , we must decide upon floral designs and pick out the pall bearers , and we must send in a notice to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grieve for our dead . " They said then : " Do not leave us , Smirt ! Our joys and our griefs are shallow : there is in our lives no dignity . But you , 0 Smirt , have skill to release us from many hundreds of small bonds . Your genius is as a delivering sword ; of your wit and your fancy is made a shining pair of scissors . Snip , snip , they say , and then yet again , Snip . Thus are we set free from our packthread bondage ; the many hundreds of small ties which confine us each in his proper station are clipped through . We become as the gods are , untrammeled . Our joys have majesty , our sorrows tread nobly , and beauty regards us with an unveiled face , very tenderly . We know then that our doom is less67SMIRTstrong than we are . We forget our cousins and the family across the street and the first of the month and the tax collector and the unpaid dues at the country club . We observe only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our delight , the land about which , like a superior Cook 's guide , the fine art of Smirt leads us on a holiday outing . " And they said also : " Do not leave us , Smirt ! We who are well-thought-of citizens must live drowsily without dreams . We can but borrow a dream here and there from the unpractical , and from the untruthfula friendly lie or two , to cheat us into warm magnanimity . Of your nonsense we have a grave need , to drug us into forgetfulness of our stupid selves and of our little manner of living . Our common-sense has confined us in a treadmill of rational doings : there is no nonsense about us , and our souls perish respectably . Liberate us , 0 Smirt , from the neverendingtyranny of our common-sense ! Yet do you have a care that the door of our treadmill be left open , so that we may be returning at will to the gray round of its genteel reiterancies .

" Now when Smirt heard this appeal , he looked at his admirers with some natural pride , and he opened his mouth affably . But before he could speak he became aware of an incredibly beautiful blonde princess , dressed in white silk , and wearing upon her forehead a huge pearl hung from a silver circlet . She had touched his arm , saying : " So ! And will you trifle with the public at large , Smirt , as lightly as you trifled with me ? " " I am sorry , " Smirt answered , with frank regret , because he had not ever seen anywhere a creature more lovely ; " I know there was once a princess . But I do not remember you .

It dates back a great many years , to the time when I was but a child , and indeed remained still a virgin . For although profoundly corrupted in nature , and though since infancy I had dreamed of the most sub tle depravities , I had not lost that which the imagina tive might call my innocence at the age of fourteen years . I had been content until that time with de- bauches of the fancy and with unshared pleasures such as well-brought-up girl children induce only in private . You came now and then to visit our palace , but at first you paid me no attention . Nevertheless I felt drawn toward you , and I regarded you furtively at all times . I thought continually about your manly beau ties , and the thought led me into many solitary ex- cesses of a nature I need not discuss . THE BLONDE PRINCESSA little later you permitted yourself to take minor liberties , such as tweaking my ear , or shaking playfullymy immature breasts , or chucking me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hallway of Lions or when I went with you to the palm garden , you would thus tease or caress me laughingly , even in the presence of the King my father , who saw no evil , peace be to his ashes ! I wished nothing better than to acquiesce in your impudence toward one in my exalted station . I shudderedwith desire to know what thing in me and in my royal blood was in movement whenever you touched me . I observed you with never failing interest ... Indeed , I can well recall that one day , in speaking to my sublime father about the wounds you had received in the war against Carthage , you offered to show him a scar which you had on your person , and for which you had avenged yourself by splitting the skull of the Nubian mercenary who inflicted it . I modestly withdrew from the apartment . But after passing through the doorway I paused , I looked back , and peeping between the curtains , I continued to observe you with interest . You unbuttoned your trousers and to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , overgrown with black wavy hairs , and traversed by a long rose-colored scar , which seemed to me very pretty in the dark flesh and7071SMIRTthe black hairs which surrounded it . I greatly wished to see what remained hidden under your shirt , but it was impossible to perceive anything definitely . I had no affection for you , yet I desired to be crushed , to be conquered , to be defiled by you , Smirt , though it were but for a few moments . Girls have these passing fancies . So whenever you looked at me after the day I saw your naked hairy thigh , I was deeply stirred ; I blushed ; and when you touched me I shuddered with pleasure . You invited me to visit your library . I came full of hunger for an adventure which would be tangible , and so might perhaps rid me of desires which , because they were not yet satisfied , had assumed unpleasant proportions and gave me no peace . I was not destined to inspect your wealth of rare first editions and of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor was I to delight in your wittily derogatory comments upon such of these writers as were your personal friends . For before showing me these books , you exhibited to me your home at large , and so led me into your bedroom . Upon entering this intimate chamber , all closed and quiet , and smelling so delightfully of soap and cigarettesmoke and leather , I was as if stupefied . My alarms , my curiosities , and my hopes , now aroused in all my body such violent palpitations that I was half72THE BLONDE PRINCESSsuffocated , and I felt my hands and feet to be very cold . You caused me to sit upon a red-covered sofa ; you sat beside me ; and in the while that with your customaryease and elegance you talked about stamp collectingand the fiscal policy of Napoleon , you laughed continually with an unnatural and constrained air . Your eyes had become so strange that I was both afraid and enchanted . I did not know what to say . I was ashamed , and I became red as a sunset . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fore-finger you tickled the palm of my hand , very gently ; and drawing me into your lap , you commenced to kiss me upon the ear , murmuring and whispering so indistinctly that I understood nothing . The room was now silent . All seemed unbelievably silent . I could hear only my own heart beating frantically . For a little while I remained motionless upon your knees , while your right arm embraced me , and you continued to kiss lightly my hair , my cheeks , my neck . I felt myself dying of pleasure , for never had I experienced such delight . But now your left hand had strayed indiscreetly , and it thus provoked new ardors . You questioned me in a voice so hoarse that I was frightened . I could not answer at first , so much was I troubled. 73SMIRT THE BLONDE PRINCESSI said by-and-by that you ought to be ashamed of yourself . You arose then , you went to turn the key in the door , you drew down the shades of three windows nearly to the bottom , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror , and with desire . You began to undress me in the twinkling of an eye , with hot hands that ran fondly over my bared flesh . You knelt to take off my shoes ; upon arising you removed also my chemise and my drawers , which were of the quaint old full-bottomed pattern then worn by all women . Afterward , lifting your willing victim in both arms , you carried me like a sacrifice toward the altar of your bed . I regarded it as a sample of your forethought that the coverlets of this bed were already hospitably turned down . Need I continue ? To particularize the ensuing events would require a peculiarly Gallic touch : and the French themselves have the proverb , La femme assez sait qui sait vivre et se taire . Or , as the Scots phrase it , She kens muckle wha kens when to haud her tongue . All modern languages , in fine , preserve , in one or another variant , the sage Latin saying , Mulier sapit qui pauca loquitur . Since I believe this sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my narrative , I shall now honor this sentiment. 74And in fact it appears sufficient to remark that the brief pain which you gave you repaid with a dozen delights . It seemed to me that I drowned in pleasure . Yet many of your doings astonished my inexperience , especially , I remember , when at the supreme moment of our first encounter you bellowed gently , like a refinedbull . When you arose , at last , combing back your dishevelled dark curls with your fingers , and uttering deep sighs of satisfaction , I too was content . After we had bathed and dressed carefully , so as to abstain from all appearance of evil , as the Apostle Paul has directed , then I regarded myself in your mirror . I was impressed with the strange and almost frightening beauty which I had at this moment . My face was flushed delicately , my lips were as red as though stained with wet blood , and my eyes glittered with an inhuman lustre . I was proud of myself . I exulted both in the pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given . You made me promise not ever to return to your embraces , so that the memory of our debauch might endure in untarnished splendor ; and this I did promise , with all my heart . I had never known a clay more glorious or happy : it seemed to me I had begun to live only during the one hour and twenty-five minuteswhich I had passed in your convivial and educativebed ; but I knew those eighty-five minutes could75SMIRTnot ever be recaptured . Besides , at no instant did I feel for you any affection . You came no more to the palace . I did not see you again . It occurred to me that my sublime father had perhaps caused you to be executed , after the usual tortures ; but so taxing had become the ever widen- ing range of my anatomical studies , under an efficient corps of varied instructors , that I lacked time to in- quire into this matter . Such , Smirt , was the history of our acquaintance . When the blonde princess had finished her recital , Smirt frowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am sorry , " he said , " but I do not remember you , at this present stage in my dream . The scar exists ; but it was not given by a Nubian mercenary . There are yet other discrepancies in your story , alike of archeology and of local color , as well as , I modestly admit , of arithmetic . Still more perplexing , however , is the fact that you describe your release from tech- nical virtue with an exactitude and a convincing truthfulness which prove you not to be female . " " Why , Smirt , but whatever nonsense are you talk- ing ? Is this the bosom of a man ? Do you feel here the thighs of a man ? Or for that matter  --  " " Pardon me , " Smirt said , withdrawing his hand , 76THE BLONDE PRINCESS " but I am to be convinced in this delicate affair neither by sight nor touch , nor by any other of my senses . I prefer to be guided by experience . " " And yet in a tete-a-tote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his senses . " " Nevertheless , " Smirt replied , " I can remember seducingno young woman who did not afterward contend  --  quiteas though I had not been present during the whole transaction  --  that I had either persuaded her against her will or brutally overpowered her resistance . I can recall no gentlewoman into whose life I have brought romance who did not display afterward , more or less volubly , this quaint hallucination . You do not display it : and I deduce , as a sound logician , that you are not female . " The princess stared at him , smiling a little oddly . You saw that the large pearl she wore upon her foreheadhad altered in its coloring : for it glowed now like a ruby . And Smirt continued to speak with extreme and careful politeness : " No , I do not remember you . I can but suggest that during the prolonged career of a Peripatetic Episcopalian one necessarily forgets much . There need be no personal side to such forgetfulness . I do not remember you : that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear sir , why you should have enkindled in77SMIRTevery part of your body to this fiery red color , and have sprouted two horns and a very long forked tail  --  Why , but what the devil ! " " Formerly , " agreed the so remarkably transformed princess , " I was called that . But what with the progressof science and of scepticism , and the need to cut down our operating expenses , and the great popularityof mergers , affairs have been altered . " As the junior partner , " the appalling fiend continued , " it is a part of my duties to relieve the old gentleman of all these routine affairs in the way of temptationand carnality and so on . Yes , Smirt , we have conducted business for a long while now as All-Highest &; Company . " The speaker and Smirt were at this instant sitting astride upon a flash of lightning , confronting each other , so that Smirt journeyed face forward , and the scarlet devil courteously rode backwards , as these two travelled with a great and yet almost unremarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the stars there is no atmosphere . Smirt had thus no actual feeling of movement ; and it seemed to him a rather odd thing , this sensation of sitting quite still on a flash of lightning . Yet he saw that above and below , and on every side of Company and Smirt , glittered various con-79SMIRTstellations , and all these appeared constantly to shift in position and to pass away , so quickly travelled the flash of lightning through endless space . And Smirt noted yet another odd thing : the right foot of Companywas human , but the left foot was shaped like the hoof of a goat . " Let us distinguish , " said Smirt , when he had wholly got his bearings : " for I was not tempted in the least . " Red Company shrugged . " And why should you be , Smirt , with so many plump and juicy young women about , as alike as peas in a pod to begin with , and to end with , as alike as wives in a bed ? I blushed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience and savoir faire with such trumpery bait ; but the old gentleman has in these matters His own notions . Unprogressive , I fear . And even these notionsI bungled . So you saw through me , of course . You caught at once my slight slip in feminine psychology , because you understand women better than I do . " " Oh , that , Company , that is a mere matter of experience . You should see more of them , that only is needed . Indeed it occurs to me that , with a little more experience of women , you might find women of a decided usefulness in your own province , of stirring up disquiet and wickedness among men . " 8o- &; COMPANY " I shall make a note of that , Smirt , " said the fiend gratefully ; and he produced a small red note-book with a red pencil . " Meanwhile I am flustered . Your acumen has quite dumbfounded me at the moment I was going on to offer you strange sins and infamous pleasures and all the subtler refinements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no need to go into it now . To the contrary , it is a relief to me to be spared such uncongenial nonsense . The old gentleman writes all those speeches , I must tell you . He reads Oscar Wilde a great deal . " " Why , then , since your evil devices have failed , to what cause , Company , should I attribute the pleasure of your company , or perhaps , " Smirt continued , with his unfailing flair for that variousness which is the life of prose , " perhaps one had better say of your society , on this flash of lightning ? " " It is merely that , since our management of Earth does not please you , " replied Company , as he indicated a planet now only some few million miles ahead of them , " you have here a specimen of our later style of work , which we would be delighted to present with the firm 's compliments . " " And what would I do with that planet , Company ? " " Why , whatsoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my diabolical arts and retain the8iSMIRTold gentleman 's pocket piece . For that , I must tell you , confers omnipotence  --  within limits . " " Oh , I see . The coin is a talisman which confers omnipotence  --  within limits . That is quite con-venient . " Thereupon Smirt took out of his pocket the forty reis piece , and he wished for a package of cigarettes . How it happened there is no telling , but straightway the coin lay in Smirt 's hand on top of a package of cigarettes which Smirt regarded with chill disapproval . Not even in the matter of smoking did these divine beings appear intelligent . " Plain Virginia tobacco  --  along with a box of matches , please , " said Smirt long-sufferingly ; and at once his will was accomplished . Then Smirt resumed his conversation with the Lord of Evil , saying : " Why good tobacco should ever be degraded with a mixture of Turkish tobacco is more than my limited imagination has yet been able to conceive . No , Company : I appreciate your offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But for nie to exercise my omnipotence  --  even within limits  --  over any planet , would involve my becoming the God of that planet . It would mean responsibility . No ; I very much prefer to criticize , and to disparage urbanely , the conduct of a world for which someone else is responsible . " 82- &; COMPANY " That is true , Smirt , as we have often learned to our cost . Ah , but what dashing epigrams you have made about both good and evil with that fine urbanityof yours ! " " Oh , but come now , " Smirt comforted Company , " there was nothing personal intended . In all I have written as to your universe , I , as an Episcopalian , believed  --  inso far of course as any absolute conviction is permitted to an Episcopalian  --  that neither memberof your firm existed . So none of my wit and fancy and erudition was consciously aimed at either of you . I simply did not know of your existence , far less of your consolidation ; but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hair dwindles , Smirt , the wits increase . " Smirt looked at his dreadful companion for a moment . Smirt lighted a cigarette , and Smirt said , " You remind me , Company , of a good story that is going the rounds . " " Then let us have it , Smirt , for my sense of humor is devilish keen . " " Stop me if you have heard this , " Smirt urged ; and he continued : " A good story is going the rounds about a skittish banker , whose hair , in spite of all his precautions , is beginning to grow thin . His partner in business , it seems , was summoned to the telephone late one eve-83SMIRTping , and under the impression that this was a long-distance call , did not answer  --  " " Ah , yes , " said Company , " but all partners are like that . I know them . For I too have a partner ; and betweenourselves , Smirt , I sometimes think I might just as well have a palsy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , He has many sterling qualities , Smirt . I would be the last person to criticize my collaborator . Some people are simply born scatter-brained and muddled , and there is no doing anything whatever about it . " Here again , Smirt reflected , was the auctorial temperament : but with his usual modesty , Smirt ( in continuinghis anecdote ) refrained from all comment . " He thought little of it at the time , " Smirt went on , " not having noticed anyone in the hallway . Only two days later , however , after the police had been most reluctantly called in , a sedate and personable young manicurist , with an uncommonly fine head of naturally blonde hair  --  " " Oho ! " said Company , winking , " but now I see . And I know that sort of young woman from her boots up as far as one usually goes . " "  --  Was arrested in St. Louis , " Smirt continued : " and after having been questioned rigorously , confessedshe had nothing to do with the robbery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too amorousemployer in this startling fashion . " Company laughed over this anecdote with such fervor as to incur grave danger of tumbling off the flash of lightning . He said , as he wiped away his tears with a red handkerchief : " That is human nature , all over . I see a great deal of it in my own work . Yes , that is not only a very funny story . It is an instructive story . I must remember to tell the All-Highest that story ,  --  though , betweenourselves , Smirt , humor is not His strong point . " " You surprise me , " Smirt stated , " upon at least two grounds . " " He has many sterling qualities , Smirt . But , no , humor is not one of them , just between ourselves . However , let us say no more about this little defect , Smirt , and  --  to go back in our conversation  --  we shall trust by-and-by to have the benefit of your yet further criticism and of your damned urbanity also . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised . " Ah , but in my mouth , Smirt , the adjective damned ' is , as you will readily see , a great compliment , since it represents my beau ideal in all matters . " " Yes , that is true . I quite understand . And it will be a pleasure , Company , to help you out in any pos-85SMIRTsible way with my experience , my savoir faire , and indeed , if I may so , with my reputation . If people knew that I was interested in your universe , and that I had consented in some sort to supervise it , why , that , you see , well , it would get you a certain followingamong the very cognoscenti who just now make fun of your universe . It would give you a cachet , a prestige , and in brief an esthetic je ne sais quoi . " The fiend regarded Smirt reflectively , with a smile of frank pleasure . Company said , " You are kind , Smirt , with an unlooked-for condescensionwhich I can but humbly describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company , because I believe in myself . That is virtually a lost art in these days of democracy and of altruism and of other herdmakingdevices . " " In short  --  you are Smirt . " " That is my metier . But , to go back a little  --  in regard to the planet you offered just now  --  I must point out , for your own good , my dear fellow , that in the firm 's place , I would have made the planet a perfect sphere . It is an ungrateful task to look a gift planet in the polar regions . Still , that flattening at each polar region , it really is an error in taste . It is not graceful . Form , my dear Company , form is86  --  &; COMPANYthe first consideration in every branch of art . The thing lacks symmetry . " The red fiend fetched out his red note-book . He said : " Now that you draw my attention , Smirt , I can see what you mean . I shall make a note of it . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seemingly imperfect piece of workmanship  --  " " Oh , not at all , my dear Company ! I accept planets in the spirit in which they are offered . It is a rule with me. " "  --  And besides , the irregularity is very slight . " This touched upon heresy . Smirt at once became grave . He remarked gravely : " In art there are no trifles . Through continued attention to trifles , in that way alone , may perfection be , not ever reached , to be sure , my dear sir , but adumbrated . " " I shall make a note of that also , Smirt  --  for our future guidance . " " And for another matter , Company , the planet lacks distinction . It is shaped , I mean , exactly like any other planet ; it is ornamented with the usual continentsand oceans ; and the trite moon attends it . Your firm really does fall rather into a rut , sir , I am afraid , when I consider the thousands of quite similar planetswhich you have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Smirt 's criticism . And Company now said , to defend himself : " But it is the All-Highest , Smirt , who attends to the designing and to cosmology in general . He has many sterling qualities , let us remember . I do not say that inventiveness is one of them . And at His age every artist has necessarily formed his style . " " That is true , " said Smirt , " even when the style ambles in unabashed mediocrity ; and I have no doubt that , after all , the firm has done its best . One should not , perhaps , in strict fairness , ask more . Nevertheless , for your own good , I must warn you that among the better class of critics mere repetition is not esteemed . It is not seemly that space should be thus cluttered up with planets as indistinguishable from one another as the books of an aging novelist . " At that , Company produced once more his small red book . " I shall make yet another note , Smirt , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to end ; and we will of course weigh the suggestionwith due care . " " And for another matter , Company , now that we are upon the topic of evil , and since it has thus cropped up of itself , as it were , as naturally as originalsin  --  " 88  --  &; COMPANY " But were we indeed upon the topic of evil , Smirt ? " " Obviously , my dear sir , since both you and I are even now talking about it . Evil , as I was about to note with regret when you interrupted me  --  oh , but no apologies are necessary !  --  evil is not what it used to be ; and all human wickedness tends to deteriorate in its quality . Now I hold no brief for evil : quite possibly , from an ethical point of view , it would be as well to abolish evil , howsoever unsettling might be the resultant disemployment of former members of the police force , of the bar , and of the judiciary . That , you understand , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , that evil is your province . My point is merely that so long as you , Company , continue to supply the world with evil , it should be your pride as an artist to furnish a somewhatsuperior grade to that now in use . " The fiend had opened his little red book yet again , asking , " And what do you suggest , Smirt  --  ? " " I suggest that the first step , the really decisive step , is to effect a complete change in our modern style of dress . It can not possibly have escaped your notice that since men took to wearing dull colors their crimes have become equally dull . " " That is perhaps true . But even so  --  " 89SMIRT " In a sack suit , in a suit just such as he knows some hundreds of other men to be wearing , " Smirt went on , " a criminal will instinctively hold up , and rob the cash register of , a shoe store or a filling station , he will forge a cheque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will commit some other folly equally vulgar and unexhilarating . Yet when suitably costumed , let us say , in a scarlet and gold doublet , or if given a neat crown and a robe of imperial purple  --  when made properly conspicuous , I repeat  --  that same misguided person might well become a Borgia or a Nero , and sin quite handsomely . " " I do not deny that , Smirt . It is only that this theory " This established rule , my dear fellow . I recall an instructive instance , now that you continue to harp on this topic . An acquaintance of mine , a dentist , had lived sordidly for years upon the petty miseries of his clients , until one Christmas morning , when his wife gave him a handsome dressing gown very richly striped with blue and silver . She insisted that he wear it about the house during the holidays , and he humoredher . He had been married for some time . But upon New Year 's eve , my dear sir , he removed from the parlor mantel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out his wife 's brains . That was not a great crime , I admit ; there was about it nothing grandiose : 90- &; COMPANYyet it did have a neat touch of originality and of grotesquepoetry , as it were , which the man had never displayed in filling teeth or in any of his bridgework ; and it must be imputed  --  as indeed the coroner 's jury did impute it  --  to his unaccustomedly rich attire . " " No doubt , Smirt , you are right . Yet I would sub-mit  --  " " Ah , but to what end , my dear fellow , when I am supported everywhere by zoology ? For do you but observethe animal kingdom ! It is the sheep , the rabbit , and the ignoble hyena who wear dull colors , where the tiger , the leopard , and the serpent go splendidly attired . These last-named feel themselves to be properlyconspicuous ; they ravage therefore with elan . They sin handsomely . " " Still , Smirt  --  " " I perceive your argument , Company . I follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prey do not ever wear bright colors , and that the shark also might seem , to the superficial , to affect unostentation . But that , my dear fellow , that is because the one of these great criminals practises his profession in the bedazzling gold and blue of high heaven , and the other among the crimson coral reefs and the millionhuedresplendent tropic seaweeds . Their sombreness among all this splendor thus lends to them just that sense of being conspicuous which , rather than mere91SMIRTbrightness , the criminal needs to inspire him . Their sombreness , I would put it , compels the eye quite as inevitably as does the mourning garb of Hamlet at the gay court of Denmark . " " Hamlet ! yes , I remember Hamlet , " replied Company . " Hamlet is by Shakespeare . Shakespeare is the greatest of all writers of English . " " In his time , my dear sir , " Smirt answered ; and he so fell into a sudden silence . " But , Smirt , that is what everyone tells me  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am not like the old gentleman : I have written no book , and I do not pretend to be literary , you understand . " " And I do not argue the matter , Company . I know that many persons affect to admire the writings of that  --  of that person . Tastes differ : some few of us have learned to appreciate the delicacies and the splendors of prose writing as an actual art : and that is all . " Now the fiend looked at Smirt , for an instant , with a grin which Smirt did not like especially . But Smirt did not say anything further to this scarlet ignoramus ; and if Smirt seemed a trifle stately and reserved , it was for a sufficient reason . " Your suggestions as to iniquity also shall be duly considered , " said Company , after making an entry in92  --  &; COMPANYhis little red book , " and in my modest way , I shall trust to profit by them . In the mean time , " he continued , just as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanished with every bit of Companyexcept his voice , " in the mean time , this , I believe , is your grave , where I was instructed to leave you. 93PART THREEBEYOND TWO TOMBS* * " Even during the Han Period learned Confucianwriters believed that prosperity , eruditionand high official rank were secured by givingto one 's ancestors grave-sites on which they could look with satisfaction and gratitude . The lin , or unicorn , is related to have appeared in China from time as a harbinger of good government , or at the birth of a virtuous ruler . " THIRTEENAT SMIRT 'S GRAVEIt surprised Smirt , thus to be standing at his own grave . Yet the range of his first disquiet was soon checked by the discovery that he and his wife had self-evidently been buried in this place a great while ago . It followed that for him to be upset , at this late date , by the deaths of these people would be out of all reason . Why , but he and Jane , to judge by these very old-looking tombstones , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have lain here undisturbed for several hundred years . As a close student of human nature , Smirt knew that no human grief can outwear a century . He inferred , as a sound logician , that the emotion of which he was now conscious could not be grief . " And besides , " he reflected , " it is likely that Smirt has a great many graves . The blonde princess knew me in what I can but assume to be an earlier incarnation . I have no doubt lived in many such incarna-97SMIRT I AT SMIRT 'S GRAVEtions . In fact , I can now perceive , dimly , that ever since time began  --  or at all events , ever since urbanityfirst came into being  --  the Peripatetic Episcopalianhas followed , upon his discreet path midway between piety and atheism , after that beauty which does not exist ; he has hungered in all eras for the impossible , irrespective of any moral ambition ; and continuallyhis own self-sufficiency has slain him . In every land lies the grave of Smirt , who could not ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company , Ergo , I can not displayany special emotion over any special one of my multitudinous graves without exhibiting undue favoritism . " Smirt looked up toward heaven , pensively . He directedthither an urbane smile ; and Smirt said : " The dull-mindedness of Your futile and charming world , All-Highest , has yet again disposed of me , unavailingly . For I still survive , You may note . And from my most recent graveside I remark that when You gave man reason , he did but cease to believe in You : there was no great hurt done , either way . But You granted him imagination also . You permitted him to create in his dreams another world than Your world . He became then Your critic , for it was apparent to him that his inventions went beyond Your inventions . " Smirt waved a protesting hand to forestall any divinereply . " In all humbleness , sir , I admit that my notions may be wrong : but I can not believe they are wrong . A thunderbolt would not , I can assure You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force would but lay You open to the charge of peevishness . Besides that , I really do think quite favorably of Your inventions , so far as they go . I have delighted in Your world : for its beauty , its curiousness , and its unintentional humor , I give all thanks . But my heart I have given to the world which I create in my dreams . " He looked down , toward the grave of his wife . " And to you also , my dearest , my heart was given . " After that , Smirt said : " You should be a proud woman , Jane , that after I do not know how many years your husband is lamenting you . You have been dead now for a great while . It was not this afternoon that you went out to play contract bridge with the Ralston girls . It was in a faraway time you left me , for your tombstone is very old . I regret that faraway time . " Smirt said : " And I have but one complainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complainments . You could not let a fire alone : you must forever be poking at it , and you needed to be pulling it about , until there was no fire , but only the remnants of aSMIRTfire . And when my shirts and my underclothes came back from the laundry you would not put them at the bottom of the pile , so that I could wear my shirts and my underclothes in a regular rotation . And besidesthat , you would not put your own shoes down in a sensible way , either , after you took them off : you put always the left shoe on the right side , and the right shoe on the left , so that I was continually straightening after you . " He blinked a little , wondering at this unaccountablemoistness of his eyes . And Smirt said then : " But my fourth complainmentis that you never permitted me to wish I was married to somebody else . You made of me a man who did not have but one wife , and at times that made me wonder if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other distinguished writer , and there was no famous artist of any kind , but had his third wife , or perhaps his fifth wife , and was getting on with her so very badly that he would soon have another wife . But I had only you , my dearest , and I desired only you ; and your common-sense made me over into as good a husband as could be expected . " He considered that fact with frank wonder . Yes , he had been an excellent husband . And Smirt said also : " You were a wise woman , Jane . It did not matter to you that in my mind I was iooAT SMIRT 'S GRAVEunfaithful and followed after a beauty which does not exist . You knew that mere human thinking does not amount to much , after all . You knew that men were very often up to such nonsense . It was a thing which you had to put up with , like dentists , and like rainy weather , and like traffic policemen . You did not bother about such male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that I made mirth and beauty ; you would have liked it better if I had made shoes or sermons or prescriptions ; but , as matters fell about in this imperfect world , the genius of your husband was a matter which you had to put up with ; so you condoned it loyally . You made me as good a wife as could be expected . " And finally Smirt said : " It is very right that when the tourists and the lovers of fine literature come here to weep over the grave of Smirt they must weep over your grave also . It is proper that every biographer should put a picture of you in all my biographies , and that the orators should speak nicely about you at my centenaries until time ends . So do I cry out to you , my dearest , who have been dead now for a great long while , Hail and farewell ! " Then only did Smirt perceive those persons who had surrounded him. lotIt was on the top of a bleak mountain , seemingly , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two graves . He saw that some fourteen persons had gathered about him , in a gray twilight ; and the butcher said : " The more the merrier . Smirt is in our midst . Polly put the kettle on ! Never had I hoped to find among us that genius who depicts with such utter loveliness , such impish wit , and such tender humanity , man 's endless searching after the golden dream which he creates for himself . " " Pleased to meet you , Smirt , " said the baker . " You must promise to pay us a nice long visit . I never saw you looking better . Anyone with a soul to appreciate beauty will find in countless pages of your books that which no other living writer can offer . " And the candlestick maker remarked : " Now , but this is a pleasure ! I admire your style as much as I 102THE PUBLIC STILL AT LARGEdeplore your morals . Yet both of us bring light into dark places ; and all men of ability should know one another . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for it is you , my admirers , who have gathered at this graveside ! " Tom answered him : " You bet your bottom dollar . Have a look at the real Simon Pure . " " None others need apply , " said Dick . " We are the public at large . We only are the lords of distinguished persons ; and we agree , just now , that your books are whimsical , elfin , and even romantic , without being banal . " And Harry said confidentially : " Trademark blown on each bottom . Your writings are pure and beneficent . A Boston policeman can read your collected works without a blush . The most innocent maiden of fifteen can read any book of yours from cover to cover and then lay it down completely disappointed . " " And how , my admirers , are you called in this planet ? " " We are roses by any other name , " replied Madame Quelquechose . " But a few great persons know that we rule over them , the poor fish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omnipotence , became in-sane . " " The fish went cuckoo , " Senora Etcetera explained . 103SMIRT " Cuckoo , jug-jug-jug , tirili-lio , caw-caw , tweet-tweet- tweet , cluck , quack-quack ! No sane fish has ever dared to think about our idiocy . " " And do we worry ? " asked Lady Ampersand , con- temptuously . " We who alone are eternal and al- mighty are not honored in public by the well- thought-of . Which shows that twice two makes hay while the sun shines . Polly put the kettle on ! But for my part , I find in the sex experience greater possibili- ties for acquiring insight than in any other experi- ence . Why should not you and I , Smirt , now step into those bushes for the purpose of discovering reason , destiny , or what you will , and thus solve the riddle of the universe ? " " Am I to understand , then , " said Smirt , a little perturbed , " that you who admire me are not wholly right in the head ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see all , hear all , know all , invent all , and exalt all . We dethrone also . Our sanity beggars description . We think , just now , that your books are very deep . One needs quite a knowledge of world literature and mythology to understand them . " " Our sanity must be seen to be appreciated , " Ibid cried out . " Make an appointment . Line forms to the right . We have neuroses and radios , but what has be- come of those old-fashioned winters ? I would rank 104 THE PUBLIC STILL AT LARGEyour books among the better-class fantasies in all modern literature . " " I really can not report , " said Smirt , " that the managementof this planet is completely satisfactory if you ladies and gentlemen be my only admirers hereabouts . " " I think your books are perfectly wonderful , " said Mrs. Murgatroyd . " We regard you as one of our leading writers , " declared the world . " You strike a responsive chord in the hearts of every type of reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cute things in your books ! " said the world 's wife . " How can any one person even write so many pretty books as you have written ? I too once knew a poet . Oh , a beautiful poet ! But he is dead now . Yes , quite dead ! Yet I shall always treasure the poems he made up about me . Mr. World is not at all literary . Mr. World is a Puritan , without any joie de vivre . Do you compose on the typewriter ? " " It all depends , " said Smirt ,  --  " and , well , goodevening , everybody ! " They replied confusedly : " Do not leave us , Smirt ! We are the true gods , but men dare not worship us openly , because of our feeble-mindedness . Great wits to madness are so near allied . Those false gods whom men pretend to hold in honor dwell very far beneath105SMIRTus . They are quite impossible persons . No gods are dependable except the public at large . What author , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us all a nice long visit , because rolling stones collect no moss . So you must teach us to regard man as a proletariancollectivist . " " But no , upon the whole , ladies and gentlemen , I think that I must be leaving you . " They became angry then , and joining hands , they all danced about Smirt in a circle , crying out in the gray twilight : " What is that to us ? Absence makes the heart grow fonder . You display a superlative egotism gone rank and stale , a pathetic vanity , and a smug self-satisfactionraised to a point beyond calculation . Polly put the kettle on ! Smirt , Smirt , he deals in dirt ! We think , just now , that you are , finally , unimportant . You buzz about in your season of sunshine , over your filthy little fantasies , like a blue-bottle fly over cow-dung . " " What is that ? " Smirt exclaimed . " I do not follow your similes . " They replied : " But we , the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lives . Do have another cup of tea ! Your prose is hopelessly artificial and over ornamented and self-conscious . We saw you in the old doctor 's barnloft . But that was under another planet , and zero weather has crept south . So do you1 o6THE PUBLIC STILL AT LARGEnow tell us , without any more shilly-shally , what will be the future trend of literature in the South ? " Smirt did not answer them . Instead , Smirt had passed onward , unhurriedly , with complete dignity , to regard a young woman whose employment appearedunusual. 107FIFTEENIS ABOUT TANAIt was a relief to have escaped from the public at large , into this pleasant upland . The pathway led by a cave ; and at the cave 's mouth , which was overgrown everywhere with the intermingled dark green and the light green of ivy , sat this woman , beside a fire of juniper wood . In her hand was a large fork , like a trident , with which she was toasting crescent-shaped cakes over this fire . She looked up at Smirt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his business in these parts . " In all parts and at all times , " he replied , " my business is of an odd nature . It is my business to crimp and to pressgang and to kidnap words . I marshalthem upon paper . I then drill these words in a not ever ending full-dress parade . " " The fine books of Smirt , " the young woman responded , still smilingly , " are noted in rumor , and they keep everywhere a famousness. " 1o8IS ABOUT TANA " So , you know me , Tana ! or at least you know me by reputation . Come now , but that is gratifying ; it is peculiarly gratifying , now that my grave is well covered over with spider webs , to find that Smirt is still known . " " I know you , Smirt , because I am served by the powers of the moon and by all else which is unstable and false and feeble . Since time began I have known you and your like , Smirt , and until time ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever be unswayed by me . " " That is as it should be , Tana . You remain always in my thoughts because it is the business of every artist to contemplate the beautiful . That fact has already arrested my steps in this place . That fact has caused me steadfastly to remember that there was once a princess  --  a princess who , I now perceive , is also a good cook , for those cakes have a delicious appearance . " " These cakes , " she told him , " are made of meal , of red wine , of salt , and of honey . Yet it is not truly these four things which I bake , and then toast , over this fire . I toast the blood and the body and the soul of the moon , so that the moon may have neither rest nor peace , and must suffer unendingly , until the moon grants me what I desire . " " In fact , Tana , when one deals with any of these 109SMIRTheavenly bodies , and especially with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to stand up for one 's rights jealously . Otherwise , there is no telling . " " That is true , Smirt  --  " "  --  For one must bear in mind , my dear Tana , that the moon has an apogee . " " You astound me , Smirt  --  " " The moon has also a perigee , a synodical period , and a mean daily motion . These are not matters to be trifled with , I submit . A prudent person will be circumspectin dealing with such endowments . " " That which you say seems wholly plausible , Smirt : and yet , " the girl added , a 1 ittle bewildered , " yet when I think about it , somehow , I do not believe it means anything . " " Why should it ? " Smirt asked , reasonably . " Because  --  why , because most persons do mean something when they talk . " " I can not fully grant that statement  --  no , not as an axiom , Tana . And in any case , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most persons . To the contrary , I am exclusive . I pick and choose my associates . For that reason , if for no other reason , you should regard it as a great compliment that Smirt has stopped here to chat with you . " Tana looked at him as if thoughtfully , for the space of two heartbeats ; and then said , lIoIS ABOUT TANA " Yet it might be better for you , Smirt , to go forwardyonder , where the path forks to the right hand . " " And to what , pray , can that path conduct me , that I should be leaving Tana for the sake of it ? " " It will lead you , Smirt , to a small snug home , and to a tidy shop with a fair line of business , and to a woman ; and all three of these will be yours for the asking . " But Smirt laughed aloud at these inducements . And Smirt said : " What are such matters , Tana , to an artist who is reasonably sophisticated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And whither , sweetheart , does that other path conduct one , where the path forks to the left hand ? " " That of course is a sinister path . And so , Smirt , that is a very little travelled path . For it turns away from use and wont and from human contentment , and from all other traps of the Spider Woman , enteringinto the fabulous city of Amit . " " Ah , ah ! But it is in that place , " said Smirt , drawing , with his habitual readiness , upon the vast stores of Smirt 's erudition , " that the Stewards of Heaven reside . " " Yes , Smirt ,  --  yet only for their allotted season . " " Well , but , Tana , it is needful there should be gods and gods , and then still other gods . It is good forIIISMIRTmythology . And yet none of them  --  do you know ?  --  none seems to be very intelligent . For I have weighed the cosmic methods of All-Highest &; Company , I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these methods , I am not optimistic . Moreover , I have seen the public at large , who mutter and bluster upon this mountain top ; and on the whole , Tana , I have seen enough of the public at large . " Now the girl raised her hand in protest . Smirt saw that the little finger was missing , or , rather , that upon neither of Tana 's hands had there ever been any little finger . " Let us not speak of the public at large , " said Tana , hastily . " Let us leave them in their high station unmolestedeven by our thinking , since none may dethronethem . Let us honor , instead , the moon and get our profit of moonshine . " " But , " Smirt replied , doubtfully , " I was not looking for profit . I was looking for a legend . " " I have many legends , Smirt . " " Then let us have three of them . " The beautiful girl arose , putting aside her trident . She entered the cave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient for you ! " SIXTEENCAVES MAKE THE CAVE-MANNow when Tana had entered her cave , she went to the black mantelpiece , and she tilted sidewise the black onyx clock ( which must have been left over from the second anecdote that I related to Company , Smirt reflected ) , and in this way she stopped its ticking . Smirt , following her with a quickness which appearedpermissible in a widower of so many centuries ' standing , saw before him a couch covered with robes of sable and ermine . The walls of the cave were hiddenby silvery-colored hangings embroidered with black stars and black suns and black comets . Upon a seven-cornered table were set forth five kinds of fruit and black wine in three silver flagons . In this cave was a great quietness . Then Tana said no . And there was not any moving her , Smirt found . She very resolutely continued to say no. 112 113SMIRT " No , for it is incredible ! " said Tana . " It frightens me , you impudent huge monster ! " Afterward Tana said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly endure it ! So do be still ! " Tana likewise said , in half stifled distress : " No , my friend , I repeat , no ! No ! .. Ah ! . . Ouh ! . . Whew ! . . Ale ! " And besides that , Tana said , almost inaudibly : " No , sweetheart , but you go too far ! Fie , sweetheart , stop , stop ! all , but do not stop ! Oho , sweetheart , but you will be the death of me , sweetheart ! " You heard also , in this quiet cave , a gentle bellowingnoise , such as might have been uttered by an unusuallyrefined bull. " 4SEVENTEENPATCHES OF MOONSHINESo now , you obstreperous and shameless Smirt , do you sit down beside me , at my feet , like a pacified good child , " said Tana , after she had thus denied Smirt , for the third time , copiously . " And let us both rest a little in the while that I speak of my legends . " She spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his hair with formal gestures . Now the words of Tana resembled the humming of bees , they were like the sedate noise of a top turning round and round and round , ceaselessly . And they may well have been magic words , for it seemed to Smirt that this sound was the sound of a spinning-wheel upon which all the thread of his life was spun . It seemed to him that long years passed by , and went away from him forever , in the drone of this peace-giving noise and under the fond touch of those peace-giving deformedhands . Yet all the while the clock told him that the time did not change. 115SMIRT So was it that for one bewildering instant Smirt got his profit of moonshine . For it seemed to him during this instant that the magic of Tana conferred on him four powers . It seemed to him that he at last understood the voice of the wind , and knew how to change water into wine , how to tame wild beasts , and how to cure all diseases except curiosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into dark places where the Old Believers , men and women and small children alike , supped together naked , eating pe- culiar foods which Smirt did not touch , and afterward they danced their peculiar dances , and sang and made music , and then made love , all in complete darkness , so that no one of them knew the other . Yet the black onyx clock upon Tana 's black mantelpiece told Smirt that the time remained twelve minutes after six , just as though it were all happening upon the front page of the Herald Tribune . Smirt was well content with this manner of magic . He knew , nevertheless , that he still sat at the feet of Tana . He knew that all these matters were but a mo- mentary illusion put upon him by the moon 's power ; and he wondered whether it was done with the peri- gee or the apogee , now that the moon 's ancient magic had shown Smirt how to cure all diseases except curiosity . So he shrugged . He arose from the floor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sound logician , he started the black clock again . Then Tana cried out , clasping together her threefingeredhands , " The wrong doctor has come for me ! " " My dear , " said Smirt , " this is no medical man , but only a white rabbit , who , for all I know , has popped out of the pages of Lewis Carroll . " " No , Smirt , for it is the rabbit which lives at the foot of the cassia-tree , of the moon 's own tree , forever pounding together those drugs which make the elixir of eternal life , " replied the voice of Tana . But Tana herself was no longer there . Instead , at the side of the white rabbit , a gray cat was scamperingacross the fields of this pleasant upland . The black dog pursued neither of them . This black dog had a white muzzle and four white feet . He sat in Tana 's deserted cave , looking up , with a complacencevaguely sinister , at the black mantelpiece , where a black onyx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We are now entering , " said the black dog , " the city of Amit , the home of the Stewards of Heaven . And much good may it do you ! " EIGHTEENFROM THE RADIATORFor it may be , " the black dog continued , " that in Amit Smirt will at last find his suitable audience to be composed of these divine beings who control an entire planet . It may be that this supernal audience will content Smirt . " " Black dog , " said Smirt , " I was well enough content until you began to talk to me from the radiator in my writing room . For it was your talking , black dog , which first involved me in this nomadic sort of dreaming . It was your talking which has evicted me from the snug home wherein , I do not know how many centuries ago , I was comfortable enough with my wife and children and a steady income , and which has led me to wander about in unfamiliar places beyondmy grave . " " Self preservation , Smirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first law of nature . " " You put it trenchantly , black dog . You have a gift118FROM THE RADIATORfor the striking , the novel phrase ; and that is a fine gift . " " Bahl " said the black dog . " To begin with , I had to stand always on your radiator . " " In fact , I can imagine that to stand on a radiator , day in and day out , as your life 's work , might pall after a while , even though I have never tried it myself . " " In the second place , Smirt , you continually filled me with bits of string . " " That does sound indigestible , I admit . And yet , even so , black doh  --  " " But what is far worse , Smirt , I had to look at you all the time . " " Oh , come , but really now , black dog , I look at myself every day when I am shaving , and I can not say I feel much the worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal , Smirt . But nothing , nothing , " said the black dog , with somewhat shaken composure , " can ever hide that smug self-conceit which you call your urbanity . And I had to watch that urbanity in action , every day , and all day . It was too much for any small wooden dog to endure ; I began to feel that at any instant I might go mad and fly into splinters . " Smirt nodded , in sympathetic and complete understanding. 119SMIRT " Yes , yes , " said Smirt , " it is true that urbanity does affect some people in that way . I have noticed it . " " So I did , Smirt , I did , in sheer desperation , point out that you lacked a suitable audience . Just as you put bits of string in me , Smirt , so did I put in you dissatisfaction ; and exactly as you toasted me with your radiator , so did I grill you with the thought that two or three living persons were not talking about Smirt at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Smirt amiably ; " you wanted to get rid of me . " " Your perceptiveness , Smirt , is astounding . " But Smirt waved aside this compliment , with his usual modesty . Smirt said : " Oh , no , it is a mere matter of experience . I have noted that desire in yet other quarters . And I have encountered it not only in book reviews written by enviably young persons , black dog , but in grave magazinearticles , and in books too , by people well advancedin senility . This getting rid of me is quite a national movement , which has at many times assumed the fervor of a crusade . Some clay I must show you my press clippings . They will interest you . They will , as it were , buck you up . Oh , yes , beyond doubt they will , for a great number of these press clippings bear directly upon that same smug self-conceit about which you were just talking . " 120FROM THE RADIATOR " This , " said the black dog , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black dog , " Smirt consoled him , " my self-conceit is a popular superstition which any thoughtful person can well understand . It is a plain sample of pseudodoxia epidemics : and in its inevitabilityit outrivals by a great deal the question of the hare 's sex , or the enigma of the lion 's backward conduct in his amours , or even the vexed problem of Adam 's navel  --  " " Bah ! " said the black dog. "  --  For by the dull-minded , " Smirt went on to explaincourteously , " a person of any special talent is expected not to notice that he possesses this talent ; by the dull-minded an artist is permitted  --  o give over his life to his art , if he so elects , but he is not permitted to attach any audible importance to his art . Should he assume , in brief , in so many words , that his work is worth doing for its own worth , and is not merely a legalized form of prostitution , then that artist becomes a figure of fun . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a creative artist myself , in my own romanticizing way , I have often envied these imaginative flights of the dull-minded , which , in a democracy at least , are not ever hampered by ra-tionality . " " Bah ! " said the black dog . " But you keep saying that , when Bow-wow would121SMIRTbe a welcome change , and upon the whole far more appropriate  --  " " Bah ! " said the black dog , " bah , bah ! You talk and you talk . Bah ! None the less you are still in search for that suitable audience of yours ; and I have your writing room all to myself . " " In fact , black dog , " said Smirt equably , " it is permittedyou to remain standing on a radiator undisturbed ; and it is permitted me to enter into the august presence of the Stewards of Heaven . I do not know as yet which one of us makes the nobler bargain , no , I do not know that absolutely ; but I do know I have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is a pity , " said the black dog , in a contained frenzy , " that I was made without teeth ! There are times when I feel the need of them . However , I am in lively hopes the Spider Woman may finish the work I began . " Thus growling , he went back sulkily to his radiator ; and Smirt entered the city of Amit with entire urbanity. 122PART FOURTEACHES BY EXAMPLE " According to Plutarch and Herodotus , the Mnevis of the Egyptians was held by some to be the mystic father of Apis . Again , in DeuteronomyXXVIII , we find the first fruits of the body ' promised as one of the special blessingsfor obedience to the law . It will be remembered also that the oldest Spanish university , at Salamanca , was founded in 1240 . " NINETEENTHE STEWARDS OF HEAVENThe home of the Shining Ones was beautiful beyond imagining . It seemed not certain that even the refinedand sinewy and multi-colored prose of Smirt could do full justice to Amit , now that in order to welcome Smirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tall master of that palace attended by his symbolic animal  --  excepting Phaleg , who came in red robes , like a much magnified cardinal , followed by a peacock . Six of the Shining Ones wore eternal youth . Arathron , the Divine Father , alone kept the appearance , becoming to his estate , of a bearded man in early middle life whom a sedate mouse-colored goat accompaniedeverywhither . All were serene and handsome huge persons , and yet , as Smirt saw , they were impervious to humor . It was not possible to conceive that any one of them had ever laughed over anything which was not wholly stupid . The nobility of their125SMIRT faces and of their heroic forms and of their sublime dullness was a vague trouble to Smirt . These gods reminded him of a drove of superb cattle . Such were the seven Stewards of Heaven , who said : " Homage to Smirt ! Be very welcome to this place , to the eternal city of Amit . We have all heard of Smirt . Until to-day no fortunate one of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of any god . To-day the bliss of the Shining Ones is made complete . " " Upon my word , " Smirt reflected , " but these di- vine beings , if a little dull-minded , yet have big hearts , as well as a mighty civil way of putting matters . " " Now do you tell us , " said Bethor , " what will be the future trend of Southern literature , what is your philosophy of life , and which one of your books do you like best . " " Well , " Smirt replied , " I would say that all de- pends . " " Do you write in the morning or the evening ? " asked Phaleg , " and does your secretary open all your letters ? It must be simply wonderful to be a writer . Do you think that capitalism is doomed ? What critic has best understood your work as a whole ? " " That , too , that all depends , my dear sir , " Smirt assured Phaleg , " although I grant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side . " 126 Then Och asked : " What author has most influencedyou ? Do you compose on a typewriter ? If I were to tell you a perfectly true story about what happened to an aunt of mine would you like to make a book out of it ? Why do you not write for the movingpictures ? " And thereafter , of course , the Shining Ones began to inquire about the younger Southern writers . " Tell us frankly , " said Phul ( who was an hermaphrodite , clothed in pale green and pale yellow ) " just what you think about DuBose Heyward , Roark Bradford , T. S. Stribling , Julia Peterkin , Hervey Allen , Thomas Wolfe , William Faulkner , and Paul Green . It must be simply wonderful to he a writer . What effect will the radio have upon literature ? " " Do you write every day , " inquired Ophiel , " or do you wait for inspiration to move you ? If I send you a book will you autograph it for a young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousin , and who has already read one of your books ? What do you usuallyhave for breakfast when you are writing ? How did you happen to take up writing as a profession ? Do you really understand James Joyce ? " Hagith said : " When is your next book to appear ? Are you working on anything just now ? Have you devoted much study to Karl Marx ? Who is Karl Marx ? What are you going to call your next book ? " 127SMIRTAll the other usual questions did the huge Shining Ones ask with that benevolent inattention which befitsthe asking of these questions . Smirt began to feel quite at ease in the home of the Shining Ones , wherein every customary tribute was paid to the genius of a visiting writer . Everyone was abeam with delight , for all these divine beings had heard about Smirt 's wonderful books from absolutely everybody , they told him , and they were all planning to read these books on the very first opportunity . Meanwhile , they had arranged in his honor a banquet ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address the gods , as their toast-master. 128TWENTYCONCERNS ROUTINE MATTERSContinuing , Arathron remarked that he need say no more . He would add only that his endeavors to say anything whatever this evening had reminded the speaker of a story ; which Arathron narrated . Like that Scotchman , gentlemen , your toast-master was unaccustomed to public speaking , though for a different reason . ( Laughter . ) He had been caught this evening quite unprepared by the arrival of Heaven 's distinguishedguest . ( Applause . ) This pleasant surprise , this highly pleasant surprise , had permitted the speaker no time for the preparation of any formal address , as in fact must be only too evident to his hearers . ( Cries of No , no ! ) Arathron could but speak as the heart prompted : indeed , his present predicamentreminded the speaker of a story ; which Arathron narrated . Well , and like that Irishman , gentlemen , the Stewardsof Heaven had been afforded an unlooked-for129SMIRT pleasure . ( Prolonged applause . ) The speaker might make bold to say it was an exceedingly great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks along that line . It was sufficient to say they had among them one than whom no living writer , one in fact whose name was a household word among all lovers of a great and ancient art , for the speaker alluded to litera- ture . ( Cheers . ) Literature , gentlemen , had its place , its esteemed place , in the life of every cultured person , and a special function that  --  inasmuch as no ladies were present  --  reminded the speaker of a story ; which Arathron narrated . It might be , the conclusion reached by the travel- ing man was not wholly logical . ( Loud laughter . ) It was not for the speaker to say . He could say boldly , however , without any fear of successful contradic- tion  --  And Arathron did say it , at some length . Smirt felt more and more at ease iii the home of the Shining Ones , where every customary tribute was being paid to the genius of a visiting writer ; so that , at the conclusion of Arathron 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elegance , his customary impromptu acknowledgment . The brilliant , cordial , and engagingly modest observations of the guest of honor were greeted with all the cus- tomary applause . 130 CONCERNS ROUTINE MATTERSThereafter the Stewards of Heaven spoke of their own labors , in the while that the Shining Ones continued to partake of the banquet ; for now Arathron was questioning his children as to how they had spent the day at their offices as the Stewards of Heaven . And they answered him , belching reverently . Bethor replied first . He was by much the largest of the seven Stewards ; he was of a golden color ; he was clothed in sea-green and purple ; and at his goldshodfeet crouched a lion . Two thousand and nine hundred legions of salamanders served under Bethor in the daily labors of his office . Now Bethor told about how he had caused zero weather to creep south , and had caused four lives to be claimed in feud war , with five wounded , and had caused Congress to meet in heated session . Hagith talked next . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most friendly looking of all the Stewards . He dressed in white and very light blue ; he wore upon his breast an engraved tablet of burnished copper ; a white bull lay beside him . Four thousand legions of undines were at Hagith 's command . Hagith and his undines had during the term of that day split a French cabinet , and they had displayedstorm warnings along the coast , as far as Cape Hatteras , and they had led a worried mother to slay son and self . All in all , it had been somewhat an off-131SMIRTday , devoted entirely to routine work , Hagith reportedmodestly . Then Phaleg spoke . He was of a ruddy color , wearingscarlet ; and a peacock attended him . Phaleg ruled over those thirty-five principalities which the gnomes inhabit . That day the red troops of Phaleg had compelleda banker to be flayed in quiz , and a gangster to go jestingly to death chair , and an irate husband to surprise couple in love nest . Each one of the huge children of Arathron spoke with just that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humorless Steward of Heaven , by whom even the most trivial and most tedious duties of his station were discharged conscientiously . But this was their hour of relaxation . So they jested heavily over their celestial banquet , becoming more and yet more befuddled as the Stewards swilled down the dark beer of Sekmct , until they had all reached a state of dignified and complete incoherence . This beer , to Smirt 's personal taste , was unattractivelyseasoned , with mandrakes and with humanblood , so that Smirt did not partake of it , nor did he eat any of the banquet . In brief , the Stewards of Heaven drank out the evening as conscientiously as throughout the day they had worked , giving to the pleasures of the table their proper therapeutic place in the economy of divine132CONCERNS ROUTINE MATTERSliving . They thus drugged themselves into a restful stupor with the dark beer of Sekmet . They now sprawled in their great gold and ivory chairs , snoring . But pallid Ophiel , who was dressed in black and azure , had fallen out of his chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buffalo served as a pillow . Smirt only remained awake and alert in the eternal city of Amit . TWENTY-ONEEPILOGUE OF SOBRIETYSmirt alone remained awake and alert , and wholly sober , in the eternal city of Amit ; and he regarded the insensible large overlords of this place a bit ruefully . Drunkenness Smirt did not mind in particular , since his long residence in a land given over to the barbaritiesof Prohibition had made Smirt familiar with diunkenness : but he did think it sad that to-morrow every one of these immortal beings would be at his office , seeing to it that a biplane plunged near Golden Gate , or that a bishop rapped modern tendencies , or that forty-three women 's dresses , formerly to $16.50 , should be $5.00 . Yes ; Smirt found it all a little sad , and a trifle perplexing : yet , since the Stewards of Heaven were only realists , their doings , he decided , as he sat in urbane sobriety among these divine drunkards , did not really matter . Such doings did not enter into the sphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOBRIETYportant than human life , which such doings helped to keep in its normal condition satisfactorily enough , Smirt supposed , from any divine point of view . " Yet I would not contemn human life , not wholly , " Smirt admitted . " To the aristocracy of Earth  --  to personsof birth and intelligence and means and culture , and , perhaps above all , to persons with a correct sense of humor  --  the requirements of civilized living have always seemed both comely and captivating . For these urbane if infrequent persons , living has become , nowadays , a form of art pursued hazardously at the heart of a whirlwind . And living is thus made an everdangerousand many-colored and Protean affair for such finely attuned beings as still manage to dissociate themselves from the dull daily labor , the stupidities , the quaint moral ambitions , and the depressing sturdiness , of mankind at large . They get  --  as the vulgarsay  --  a double kick out of living , nowadays . " For of course ( his meditations strolled on ) whensoeveryou considered the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputable bourgeois about , all yammering ; and , even below the scared bourgeois , you noticed everywhere the unbathed and yelping proletariat . . . Proletarians Smirt took to be the sort of people whose automobiles displayed advertising matteron the cover of the spare tire : and , in academic theory at least , he broad-mindedly ranked them as135SMIRThuman beings . . . Well , and all these odd creatures appearedso fretted and so terror-stricken , nowadays , that you mildly wondered at what instant the animals would begin to murder one another . " It will be an excellent film , " Smirt reflected , " with no cuts by the censor . It will be the end of that queer world which the newspapers tell about  --  and , what is a far graver matter , it will be the temporary end of Earth 's urbane aristocracy . My lords , the tumbrils wait : and I fancy these divine drunkards about me know that as well as I do . I condone , therefore , where I can not exculpate . " After that , Smirt took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smirt omnipotent  --  within limits ,  --  and he wished for a package of Virginian cigarettes and a box of matches . He inhaled pensively . And Smirt said : " Against stupidity even the gods are powerless in every handy book of quotations . I begin now to understand that saying . I begin to see that my wit and my fancy and my profundity arc at loose ends in a universe which has no real need for these intellectual luxuries . " 136TWENTY-TWOARACHNE RETURNSNow the seven Stewards of Heaven sat at ease , looking over the polished white stone ramparts of their supernal home in the city of Amit , and dealing as they saw fit with the mortal world which was in their keeping . In the while that they drank the dark beer of Sekmet , one after another did they speak the word of power which put upon human beings the needed passions and calamities and desires and weaknesseswhich would lead these mortals to obey the speaker 's will . And Smirt sat with brown Arathron and the six brightly colored children of Arathron observingthe handiwork of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself a Danube economic union arranged at Paris , and Austria arrest fleeing Nazi chieftain , and Mrs. B. F. Zogbaum visiting her parents at Galax . He saw Rev. D. W. Cook resign as pastor on account of health , and old Sol on rampage , and mother of 3 slain , mate held . He saw lawyer137SMIRTdie in crash as trolley hits truck , and turn of tide indicatedby gains in trade . He saw state Solons vote bill to aid wheatgrower , and missing boy found dead in Jersey swimming pool , and he saw people buying Zip razor blades for 39  --  with this coupon , and he saw gayeties galore mark season 's height . He saw , in brief , all the sad doings of the Shining Ones as they hammeredaway at their realism . Smirt did not like it . He said as much , pointing out that all literate human beings could enjoy at will the delights of romance , if only because the books of the speaker could be borrowed from any public library ; he mentioned the address of his publisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a due share of such pleasures . " There is , for example , " Smirt remarked , " the fine legend of Arachne , which I have now in hand  --  " " We have heard , often and yet over again , " said the Stewards of Heaven , " of a hackney . It is a cross between a cart horse and a race horse . But what , 0 illustrious Smirt , may be a rackney ? " " Why , do you judge for yourself , " replied Smirt . He spoke the required word of power ; and there before them all stood the appearance of that dark young girl who had directed Smirt to the All-Highest . Then the Shining Ones murmured uneasily . If gith cried out : 138ARACHNE RETURNS " Beware of the Spider Woman ! This is she who devours ignobly the body and the soul also of her victims ! " Smirt replied : " Nonsense ! Do I not know a bit better than you do what I create ? " After that , Smirt regarded this not unattractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It appearedpermissible in a widower of so many centuries ' standing . She was very pretty , very stupid . Smirt thought of six stories into which Arachne might be fitted , but he saw too that no one of his handsome inventionssuited her . The nature of this chuckleheadednaive young creature was at odds with his habitual vein of romantic irony . She had been invented  --  andthat was the trouble  --  by another creativeartist , who for his own ends had made this girl a nicely colored and agreeably shaped moron . The further trouble was , could anybody , without prejudice , with complete urbanity , describe this happy-hearted and uncommonly pretty Arachne as a mordn ? She did not know , perhaps , as clearly as Smirt knew , what was the estimated population of Brazil , or the relative specific gravity of hard and soft coal , or the names of the seven stars in the Big Dipper ; she might not even know anything about Keats , or about the functions of the pituitary gland , or that Edward Everett had served as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tyler 's administra- tion : but she did know how to live serenely and honestly , in contentment with her surroundings . No dreams misled or troubled Arachne . She was , in a dreadful phrase , wholesome . Oh , but beyond doubt this Arachne had been in- vented by some botcher who belonged to a most de- plorable and quite obsolete school of art . Smirt spoke sharply ; and the appearance of the faintly smiling at- tendant girl was annihilated . Smirt 's reproduction of Arachne no longer existed . Smirt had not planned that destruction consciously . But an odd sense of dismay had possessed him as he regarded the girl 's innocent and stupid and so kiss- able face , because this chit  --  confound her impu- dence !  --  was just the one sort of thing he could never invent . She belonged to a more popular school of art , to an aesthetic kindergarten of sugar and fine senti- ments and uncritical optimism . Yet did Smirt desire to be loved foolishly , and above all he wanted to love this young woman very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to share with Arachne , unbothered by the touchstones of experience and savoir faire , and untrammeled by sophistication , all that high and pure and idiotic emotion which , he dimly knew , had been a part of the legend that Smirt could neither remember nor invent . It followed that , ARACHNE RETURNSfor just one instant , the urbanity of Smirt had been flawed with petulance . But he carried off this error with a light laugh . " I was ill inspired , " said Smirt . " Let us destroy and forgetthe legend of Arachne , for I have thought of a much better story . " 140 141TWENTY-THREE * * WHAT MEMORY MADEYes , I have thought of a much better story , " Smirt said , yet again . And thereafter he raided the vast stores of his scholarship and his erudition with a high hand . He spoke first the required word of power ; and he spoke also the required Invocation of Memory , saying , as his instant need was : " 0 clement and all cunning sophist , world wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolishness ! Friendly apothecary , the compounder of bland poultices , the chemist of strong healing balms , for pride 's bruises ! Skilled brewer of magnanimity ; unerring historian of the false ; discreet mortician of the unpleasant ; well-balanced acrobat , not ever to be tumbled from the trapeze of self-respect ! 0 all accom plished Memory ! do you now give me heed and aid ! " Then Smirt said also : " Let us two conspire to gether , 0 wayward lord of all trades , to create again that world which is governed great-heartedly , by the WHAT MEMORY MADEfancy of a child ; which poets revere as their native land , hungered after throughout life-long exile ; which is cherished in secret by every common-sense person bustling about shops and court rooms and office buildings ; and which by no redeemed spirit in any paradisecan be recalled unenviously. 0 all-accomplished Memory , give heed ! Let our pleasant magic now revivethat immortal world which , since it never was , may not ever perish ! " And after that , with memory to abet him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye 's twinkling . He judged , rightly , that for a divine audience so prosaic , and virtually illiterate , there was no need to invent anything new . So out of time-tested materials he builded his mythic world , after every time-approvedmodel borrowed from the best fairy tales . For there was once a princess , Smirt had always remembered , a princess who was more lovely than was any one of that season 's debutantes , and who was more desirable than a Pulitzer Prize ; and with that knowledgefirm in his mind , he found it in some sort a sentimentalpleasure to create a world fit for her inhabitancy . So in this world there were magical seas made ready for Smirt 's faintly remembered princess to sail upon , in a fairy boat drawn by swans ; and there were en-142 143SMIRTchanted forests , in which she might sleep out a centuryundisturbed , pending the arrival of some whippersnapperthird prince or another ; and there was a notable abundance of castles , builded finely of gold or of silver or of copper , suitable for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and monsters of every kind , and sorcerers of the most villanous nature , all of them peculiarly easy to kill ; and at every cross-roads Smirt stationed a dwarf or a talking fox , or it might be a talking hearth broom , to advise all wayfarers as to what lay ahead in their journeying . And besides that , at fixed intervals of fifteen miles , a king and a queen held their court , setting quaint tests for the valor and the ingenuity of the adoring adventurerswho wooed their daughter . She in every instancewas a blonde beauty of unexampled perfection ; and at each court was established both a good and a bad fairy in regular practice . Such was the world which Smirt created for the Stewards of Heaven , and which he now exhibited to them , after making antique looking all the contents of this world with a subduing varnish of Celtic glamour . It was a world such as the Shining Ones had not ever imagined during the sad aeons they had given over to realism . They beheld now the glories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seven Stewards to remark Bravo ! and Encore ! 144WHAT MEMORY MADEand Author ! and Speech ! and to make yet other happy observations . The applauded one received these tributes with his accustomed ease and urbanity ; yet all the while , at the bottom of his heart , Smirt was regretting that in no tinseled fairy land such as this could he hope to find the lost legend of Arachne. 145TWENTY-FOUR * " ESTHETICS OF ARATHRONArathron spoke , bowing his dark brow ; and the ambrosiallocks waved from the god 's immortal head . ( " For my dream becomes Homeric , " Smirt reflected . ) At the feet of Arathron a large mouse-colored goat slumbered peacefully . And thus said the All-Father : " With no winged words may I praise you fittingly . Appreciation falters before you , 0 much contriving Smirt , who do not scorn the Stewards of Heaven . Each one of us you have put at ease with some kindly remark . You have been urbane to everybody . You have with unfailing tact concealed that mental superiority of which you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shining One as an equal . " Then Smirt of the many books replied to the AllFather , saying : " Indeed upon their own plane your children entertainme . They compose a leisure class such as I had not previously observed at close range . They live " ESTHETICS OF ARATHRONin supreme magnificence , at entire ease , with no need to labor . Yet they do labor , incessantly , and day after day , to upset and to afflict and to destroy mankind , by the hundreds , in time for to-morrow morning 's paper . They put upon men every sort of discomfort and suffering , in order to create that queer world which the newspapers tell about . To do that is vile . " " Yet , " Arathron interrupted , " yet do you not believe , dear master of all certainty and of all arts , that some such preliminary training in newspaper work may be of benefit to a creative artist by-and-by ? " " I grant , " Smirt continued affably , " that the gods are above good and evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do not exist except in my dream . It is clear that non-existent persons can not commit crimes , and that in consequence the infamies which you incite can not exist either . Yes , logic proves that . But logic does not make it equally clear , to any sound logician , why the main interest of the Shining Ones , who upon the whole bore one another , should be invested in human beings ? " Arathron said that he had endeavored to make of each of his children an artist whose medium was human life , and that it had seemed to him a preliminary training in newspaper workBut all their newspaper work , Smirt interrupted at146 147SMIRTonce , was bedaubed and degraded by realism . There was in it no touch of the imaginative . " We perceive that , Smirt , now that you have revealed to us the glories of romance . Yet it had seemed to be our duty to keep life plausible for human beings , " replied Arathron , humbly . Thus he spoke . ( " Hos phato : for my dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even as an iron cauldron is troubled when , surrounded by bright fire , it is melting down the lard of a well-fatted hog ; so that at first the large pot bubbles restively , but of a sudden the goodly fat spurts upward on all sides , without any moderation : even so did the urbane patience of Smirt now boil over into candor , in the time that Smirt answered wide-browed Arathron , saying : " It is far more obviously your duty , my dear sir , to be attending to the conduct of your divine children . Apart from their endless blunders and their wholesale murderings , as when they cause zero weather to creep south or stir up feuds or set fire to department stores or start wars , in their endeavors to enliven the front page of to-morrow morning 's paper , they display yet another failing not uncommon among journalists , in that they all drink entirely too much . There is no one of them ever quite sober . What sober148ESTHETICS OF ARATHRONperson , to begin with , would think of putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downward . He stroked the head of his goat , and he wore now an air of some constraintand uneasiness . But Arathron replied only : " We drink the dark beer of Sekmet , Smirt , so that we may forget our divine destiny . There is but one doom for the super-eminent , whether he be a true god or a false god ; and none may escape it . " " And what , Arathron , is that doom ? " " It is revealed to the super-eminent alone , Smirt  --  " " Well , but , upon my word  --  ! " said Smirt. "  --  And at no time , " Arathron continued , " is the thinking of any divine person , whether he be a true god or a false god , quite free from deliberating that doom which awaits him at the appointed hour . Moreover , we drink the dark beer of Sekmet so that we Shining Ones may forget those insane beings who are above us upon this mountain top . " " Let us not speak of the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a sad truth that the gods also must depend upon the patronage and the continuedgood will of the public at large . " Thus he spoke . ( " For we stay Homeric , " thought Smirt . ) But even as a questing lion is made glad when he perceives from afar the wide-horned bull , or it may be a stiff-shanked sheep very rich in fat ; and in149SMIRThis deep mind he already devours the sweet flesh ; so that he advances boldly into the pasture , without any dread of the fleet dogs or the sharp spears of the herdsman : even so did the All-Father Arathron at this season put aside each baneful thought which had troubled his renowned nature , causing his godlike spirit to tremble within him like an emotional blanc mange ; and he spoke afterward , with the well-famed merriment of grigs and of marriage bells , saying : " What do these lesser worries matter , now that we have managed to get in touch with your publisher , and have been allowed his usual discount to divine customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the All-Father , " for that tall being is not at all the person to go a-whoring after strange gods . As in public he above his confreres , so in private do his principles tower above reproach ; and indeed in every respect I find the man to be as incomprehensible as are his royalty reports . " " Yet do you see for yourself , dear Master ! " And Arathron waved a thin dark hand in the direc- tion of Arathron 's offspring. 15o Smirt saw that to every side of him the children of Arathron sat quietly reading . They had put aside for the while their newspaper work and all stupid realistic dealings with men and women . They merely read : and they paused only to drink silently the dark beer of Sekmet which kept the Shining Ones perpetuallyfuddled . There were signs up everywhere which said Silence . Now and then one of the engrossed Stewards would put aside his book , and he would tiptoe over to an unabridged dictionary in twelve volumes , and he would look up the meaning of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reading . And now and then , too , they spoke in subdued whispers , as the Stewards conferred together . " Never had I hoped to find , " said Och , " a genius who depicts with such utter loveliness , such impish wit , and such tender humanity , man 's endless search-151SMIRTing after the golden dream which he creates for himself . " Bethor replied , " Anyone with a soul to appreciate beauty will find in countless pages of these books that which no other living writer can offer . " It was then Phaleg leaned back in his chair . He cupped his chin with his right hand ; afterward this handsome red-colored giant rubbed the palm of his right hand against the palm of his left hand , meditatively , and he pursed up his lips . " These books , " said Phaleg , " are very deep . One needs quite a knowledge of world literature and mythology to understand them . " " They strike , " agreed Hagith , " a responsive chord in the hearts of every type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stewards of Heaven were each reading the books of Smirt . Each one of them had a complete set in the definitive edition . And when each Steward had read through his set from the first volume to the last volume , then the Shining Ones arose , crying : " Homage to Smirt ! At last his genius has been recognizedfittingly . Henceforward let his aesthetic theories prevail throughout the planet which is in our keeping . Hail to thee , Smirt ! not in vain have we read your books very reverently . Hereafter shall all human life become as you have decreed . " 152RESULT OF MUCH READINGAnd Smirt , looking over the ramparts of Amit , perceived they spoke truthfully . The planet beneath Smirt had been disinfected of all matter suited to newspaper publication . The planet had been made colorful with all magics . Everywhither rode abridged likenesses of Smirt upon magnificent quests ; and each one of these secondary Smirts was speaking the most polished diction , and was doing urbanely any number of impossible things in the lands beyond commonsense . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is most gratifying , for it is in the lands beyond common-sense , if anywhere , that I must look for the legend of Arachne. " 153ABOUT A CHANGED PLANET " Xenophon consecrated fifty courtesans to the Corinthian Venus , in pursuance of the vow which he had made when he besought the goddess to give him victory in the Olympian games ; and the text of a remarkable legend of the Creation , acquired by the late Mr. A. H. Rhind in 1861 , from a tomb on the left bank of the Nile at Thebes , is yet preserved in the British Museum , where it bears the number 1o,188 . " TWENTY-SIX*AIREL OF THE BROWN HAIR*Smirt travelled happily in a reorganized planet , seekingafter the legend of Arachne . He had got , at all events , into some legend or another legend , now that a charmed staff guided him . This staff , he reflected , had been cut from the Tree of Knowledge , when the Cross of the Saviour of the Protestant Episcopal Church likewise was a portion of that green , manybranchingtree in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff in his right hand , knowing that if at any time he laid down the staff he would at once regain his sophistication and quite lose his way in this legend . He toiled thus through a ravine overgrown with brambles , with flowering gorse , with blackberry bushes , and with small , very tough vines which vexatiouslyentangled his legs , and which caught about his ankles , like strong wires . He came to an open field in which lay the dead body of a young man extremely157SMIRT like Smirt , wrapped and confined everywhere with the weavings of some great spider , so that this par- tially devoured body resembled a large gray cocoon . Smirt found this curious ; and more curious still seemed the fact that a half-finished poem was clutched in the right hand of the half-finished corpse . However , it was not a specially good poem . And after that , Smirt went by a black sign post , which said , in a lemon yellow lettering : " You are now leaving Legend of Iannak . Come again . Legend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then Smirt passed toward a white mountain and a black mountain : and as he approached them yet an- other curious sight was before Smirt , for these moun- tains hurled themselves upon each other with a vio- lence so great that both mountains were shattered into fragments . Smirt paused , a little perturbed : for every- where in front of him the air was now thick with a hailing of black stones and of white stones , as though crows and white pigeons were fighting together . Through this two-colored hailing came a brown- haired woman walking mournfully , in leggings of deerskin . She had upon her head a three-pointed crown of gold ; and a big brooch of gold glittered on her right shoulder , holding about her a cloak of two colors , a cloak of scarlet and of a green like the green 158 AIREL OF THE BROWN HAIRof young ferns . Such was Airel the conversation woman . " You have done me a great wrong , " said Airel the conversation woman , " for these mountains were my entire estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of glass , with my blue and yellow birds to attendme , and with my blue cow whose milk never failed , and with my four whispers which brought to me conversation from every quarter of the lands beyondcommon-sense . " Smirt said to her , " That is a good way to be living , Airel of the Brown Hair , having your command over these fine things . " " But it is not the way I am any longer , Smirt of the high misdeeds , now that my blue cow and my tower of glass are in Hinders , and my birds have flown away , and my whispers have fallen into deep silence , because of that ruining staff of yours . " Then Smirt answered her fondly : " To hear that is a grief which I can not put any bounds to , 0 queen of this world 's women . Yet it seemed to me that your two mountains fought of their own accord , without my having incited them in the least . " " Be that as it may be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my belongings , leaving me , 0 my grief , without any fortune in this kingdom . " " It was unintentional , I can but repeat , 0 beautiful159SMIRTkind woman . And I would willingly make any amends within my power ; but to restore mountains is not in my power , nor can I put fresh milk and lowing back into a dead cow . " " At the very least , Smirt , " said the conversation woman , " and in mere justice , Smirt , you ought now to provide me with a son to be the support of my pennilessold age . " " In fact , to a sound logician that appears more reasonable , " Smirt admitted ; " and I do not know but that it might be a pleasure , too , to a widower of so many centuries ' standing . " " Yet it is not reason I am asking of you , 0 tall comely hero , no , nor pleasure either , but mere justice . " " Then let justice be done , " said Smirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low and the middle justice . As such , I would recommend a habeas corpus . " Thus speaking , he affably went up into the gold and silver bed of Airel. 16oTWENTY-SEVENAFFAIRS OF THE FAMILY*So did Smirt enter into the gold and silver bed of Airel the conversation woman , between the bright curtains which had the color of larkspur and were hung upon rods of copper : and Airel went with him . It was not sleep that they looked for in this bed . And a good fortune blessed their endeavors without any remarkable delay , for before morning the labor pains came upon Airel , and she was delivered of her desired son . " You lose no time , " said Smirt , as he laid the child in its bronze cradle . Even as he spoke a wind blew out of the dawn , and the child was whisked away like a pink bit of paper . " Thus quickly do our blessings vanish , " Smirt moralized . But Airel replied : " I do not like pessimism . It is written , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning . " Then as they sat down to their breakfast , of elk 's 161SMIRT AFFAIRS OF THE FAMILYmeat and honey and oatmeal , and when Airel had poured ale into amber cups , a young man approached them ; and he said fondly to Airel the conversation woman , " Joy cometh in the morning . " " Joy of my life , " said Airel , " it is great wisdom you are speaking . " After that , the young hero looked at Smirt , without any fondness , but the grave brown eyes which regarded Smirt were compassionate . The young championwas tall and comely , having a green cloak about him ; about his curled dark hair was a red chaplet of sweet-smelling rowan berries ; and his face was the face of Smirt . " But who , pray , is this whippersnapper ? " Smirt asked of Airel . She replied , " It is my son Elair , he who was born this morning to be the mainstay of my old age . " " But certainly you lose no time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose us , " said Airel , gravely . And Smirt answered her : " In any case , you have not as yet any old age for him to be the mainstay of . So do let us all three sit down to breakfast without any more apothegms , or any more argument either , Airel of the Brown Hair . " " My grief ! " said Airel , keening , " there is anger in my very heart ! It is not right of you , 0 Smirt of the 162high misdeeds , to be denying me my old age whenever I want it . " " Joy of my life , " said the young man Elair , to his mother Airel , " it is great wisdom you are speaking . " Then the young man Elair took up a pipe of seven reeds . He played upon it : and as he played , old age came upon Airel , and upon Elair likewise , until both of them were shrivelled and thin beings , as white as the foaming of waves in moonshine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smirt alone at the breakfast table . " Regret has come into my heart , " said Smirt , " now that life has gone out of Airel . I lament Airel , the delight of my eyes , she who was comely and generous and pursuing . I am sorrowful now that my son Elair is blown away by the west wind . I am not happy in this place . My courage is fallen down ; my heart is a wet sponge filled with bitter tears . " It would be well for Smirt could I follow my agestrickenfamily down the long ways of the wind , now that my very old family has gone away in a fume and a dudgeon , or it might be in a huff . My hearthstone and my breakfast are cold : my urbanity fails me when I look at their coldness . I lament Airel of the Brown Hair , who can re-warm neither . " There was no coldness in her many-colored bed . She was fair and nimble . It was pleasant to put birth 163ISMIRTiupon her in six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a gray weeping mist ; my grief follows my son Elair . I would like to have seen more of him . It is a pity the way I am , now that the west wind has broken up my home life . " Yet , after all , " said Smirt , " after all , this young woman was not Arachne . No ; I have wandered into the wrong legend ; and my quest , as yet , remains un-fulfilled . " TWENTY-EIGHTINTRODUCES AN ANGELSmirt journeyed on , with the staff guiding him , into a Druid wood . In this wood he met with the more brilliantly colored birds and animals of all latitudes and with five monsters such as are indigenous to the lands beyond common-sense , so that every step of Smirt 's way was of never failing interest . He met also with an armed fighting-man , and this Kilian of the Red Marsh defied Smirt to single combat . Inasmuch as Smirt 's staff had now been turned into a sword , this appeared reasonable . So the two men fought with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then a fleecy cloud hovered over their combat and , oozing downward between the two champions , pushed them apart . An angel stepped out from the rosy depths of this cloud and inquired re-provingly : " Wherefore do you fight , the one child of Heaven against another ? I call upon you to be reconciled and 165164SMIRTto become as brothers . Be of one heart and of one mind , and turn your forces against the enemies of true religion . That is my advice to you to-day , as it was my advice yesterday to another pair of gamecocks , to the Sieurs Oliver and Roland . " Thus speaking , the angel waved a palm branch over each of the two champions , to denote that the honors of their interrupted duel were evenly divided , and the angel vanished . Kilian of the Red Marsh agreed with Smirt that the angel had spoken sensibly , in all points except one . They could not become as brothers , Kilian considered , until one of them had married the other 's sister . " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not matter , " Kilian replied , " for I have a sister , whose good looks are equalled only by her piety . It is true she was carried away by Crogan Knobald , the Dwarf King , and that she married him last year . " " Yet is it well , my dear Kilian , to come between husband and wife ? " " But is it seemly , Smirt , to be contradicting an angel ? You forget that my sister is noted for her piety . " " Oh , well , of course , if you put it that way ! " said Smirt . " Moreover , you mentioned her good looks also . And besides , it may be that your sister , in addition166INTRODUCES AN ANGELto her good looks , has also the good fortune to be called Arachne ? " Kilian was frankly puzzled . " But how , Smirt , could she be called anything of that sort ? " " Why , one has sponsors , " Smirt explained . " And they come forward , either immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at such other time as the Minister shall appoint  --  " But Kilian stayed unconvinced . " Be that as it may be , Smirt , my sister is called Oriana ; and I have never heard her called anything else . " " Then I am still in the wrong legend , " said Smirt . " But that , after all , is no reason for flying in the face of an angel . " They gave over their talking for that while , and they went through a patch of fir-trees , to an iron door with gold writing on it . They beat in the door . They came thus to a rose garden where it was always June , because the garden was fenced with a golden thread , such as used to defend the palaces of the Esir in the older time , and this thread prevented the entrance of any other month . They could not break this thread , they found , but they stooped and crawled under it without any special difficulty , because they were not months . When the Dwarf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in gold armor , with a bright X67carbuncle in his helmet ; and his delight to see his brother-in-law was unbounded . " Kilian of my heart , my pulse and my treasure , " Crogan declared , in a thin and high-pitched voice , " there is nobody I would be embracing more willingly . " " Health and good days ! " cried out Kilian , hugging the doomed monarch with compassion . Then Crogan embraced Smirt also , saying , " Health and long life , 0 friend 's friend ! " " The pleasure , " Smirt replied , " is inexpressible . And I desire for you , sir , as long a life as piety may permit . " TWENTY-NINEs* * aOF PIETY AND ORIANA4After that , the three men went together into the underground home of Crogan Knobald . A soft twilightreigned in the vast hall of the palace . The walls were of polished marble , inlaid with obscene designs in gold and silver , for Crogan was not of the true religion . The floor of this hall was formed of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the ceiling was of sapphire ; and from this ceiling hung shining rubies , like so many red stars in the blue sky of a spring evening . There was nowhere any palace more remarkable than was this palace , which , as Crogan Knobald explained , the Dwarf King had inherited , along with his rose garden , from his great-great-grandfather , King Laurin of Gargazon . The palace did , however , need to be equipped with a more modern lighting system , Smirt reflected , in the same instant Smirt perceived he was wholly wrong. 168 169SMIRTSMIRTFor all at once the entire place became brilliant as an August morning , now that Oriana had entered . Her girdle and necklace were jeweled with thirtyninegems , and in her coronet was a diamond , the third largest of all diamonds known in the lands beyondcommon-sense ; and this diamond shone like the sun , bringing the brightness of day whithersoever it came . But Oriana was far more beautiful than any one of these things , with a sedate and a saintlike loveliness . No man could take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Oriana ; nor did Smirt make any such hopeless attempt . When Grogan went to fetch wine , then Smirt complimentedthe lady , with his customary ease and elegance , upon her fine fortune in being able to rule in this wonderful palace as its queen . She replied in unaffected sincerity that , although she would never forget the home and the friends of her girlhood , no woman could be more fortunate than was Oriana in her present estate . Crogan was always good and kind , and she had learned to esteem the countless virtues of her dear husband , upon an uncarnalplane , because Crogan Knobald was not so sensually disposed and obsessed as were most other men . There was in his love no grossness and no crude materialism , this dove-like and saintly queen told170OF PIETY AND ORIANAthem , on account of a providential accident in his youth . " He was injured just here , " she explained to Smirt . Smirt replied , " Ouch ! " " It has followed , " Oriana continued , " that , while this remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our affection is thus kept perfect and holy . " Then Kilian told of the angel 's command , and Orianabegan to look at Smirt more and more thoughtfully . In her gray-colored , very large eyes he perceived unshed tears . She bent toward him , she laid her hand in Smirt 's lap , saying sorrowfully : " My friend , what choice have I in this matter ? The ways of Heaven are beyond our conjecture and beyondour disputing , equally . Yet you , I observe , have not ever been chastened by any accident : your love will be gross and material , I fear . It will trouble me vigorously . Oh , but at each instant I become more certain of that fact . " " Divine Oriana , " Smirt replied sympathetically , patting her hand , " in this world we must all bear our crosses . " " In this world , " said Kilian , " there is nothing like inspecting the property before one signs a lease . You are both prudent and virtuous , my sister . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kilian ; but yours , Smirt , is a pious reflection . " And 171SMIRTit was plain , now that Oriana had withdrawn her hand pensively from under Smirt 's half detaining hand , that Oriana had found comfort in Smirt 's axiom . " Yes , we must all bear our crosses , howsoever enormous , for the will of Heaven must not be disputed . I will put poison in Crogan 's wine , " said Oriana , and she proceeded to do so . The Dwarf King died quickly , in considerable astonishment , you could see , but without any apparentpain . Then Smirt made ready to take Oriana as his wife , and Kilian sat down beside them , smilingly anticipative , now that the angel 's command was about to be obeyed in every particular . But hardly had the three of them prepared with all suitable fervor to observe these religious duties when the two brothers of CroganKnobald came into the underground palace . They were impious heathen persons , who did not respect angels . Instead they came , bearing willow wands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast Druid spells sacrilegiously , in the while that they upsetthe plainly expressed will of Heaven . So was Kilian transformed into a green toad , and Oriana into a dove-colored snake , which at once swallowed the green toad . But upon Smirt the depravedbrothers of Crogan Knobald laid the Curse of Two Fortnights. 172THIRTYCITY OF THE DEADNow the wits of Smirt were put away from Smirt 's keeping by the Curse of Two Fortnights . He who had sat among the gods , now wandered in a lonely savageness , dribbling at the mouth which no longer conversed affably . Instead , Smirt moaned and whimperedlike a hurt dog ; and Smirt lived in the wilder lands beyond common-sense as a beast lives , nakedly , searching after roots and grubs , and then leaving them untasted , because upon no occasion during his dream did Smirt eat any food . He made his lair in a stone city , upon which its special doom had fallen , in the older times , turning all to stone . The olive-trees and the palm-trees of this city were of stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the houses of this city , you found men and women and children of various sizes , all eternally poised in whatsoever trivial or commonplace action they were engrossed by when , without any warning , 173SMIRTits doom fell upon this city , and changed all its peopleinto bluish-gray stone statues , in the midst of their shopping and love-making and stolid talking . Thus had a remarkably beautiful girl , of eighteen or thereabouts , been left forever straining at the stool in an outhouse ; and one middle-aged citizen had been petrifiedwhile he was shaving . For another queer thing , there were in this city four large spider webs , the largest which Smirt had ever seen , and in each of them dangled the skeleton of a young man picked clean of flesh . Here Smirt fared very lonelily , seeing no human creature . In his clouded mind there was panic , and remorse troubled him also , but he could not divine for what reason ; nor did Smirt think urbane thoughts under the Curse of Two Fortnights . He thought always of the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives had mattered . All these persons had passed away , fritteringly , giving over one moment after another moment to kindly and laborious and trivial doings , until no more moments remained . They had made nothing ; they had achieved nothing ; and nothing survived of them except a few torn and scattered memories in Smirt 's clouded mind . For his mind was all clouds , it seemed to him , gray clouds which moved continuously , and which boiled over one another , very lazily , and which opened now174CITY OF THE DEADand then with pale vistas in which you saw faintly the faces of the dead whom you had known when these faces had color and movement in them . And yet his mind was a ticking also , the ticking of a black onyx clock which he had seen and had heard ticking in some happier place , he did not remember where ; and this ticking counted relentlessly every moment of Smirt 's living , telling you there was one instant , then another instant , and then yet another , but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one of these instants could ever return . And besides that , his mind was a thin buzzing and a futile blustering , like the noise which is made by a blue-bottle fly ; so that this restive little noise was combined with a not ever resting ticking , in a mixturewhich troubled Smirt a great deal as he wanderedabout the dead city of Ras Seim It was not cheering to observe its petrified citizens forever arrestedin the midst of their kindly and laborious and trivial doings . And to consider them quite urbanely proved a difficult matter . For you could not think properly with a cloudiness and a ticking and a buzzing . These were not the instruments , Smirt reflected , with which people made urbane thoughts . And he knew very well what he needed. 175WHICH BECOMES LOGICALTHIRTY-ONEWHICH BECOMES LOGICALWhat I need , what I really need , to think with , " Smirt said , in strict confidence , to a black dog  --  which was not utterly black , however , because it had a white muzzle and a white tail and four white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is true , " replied the black dog . " And it ought to weigh not less than forty-two ounces , of which the gray substance should represent about thirty-eight per cent . of the entire weight . I must tell you this , Smirt , because now that you have lost your wits they have been foisted upon me , of all luckless creatures . " " I rather liked having my wits , " said Smirt , wistfully . " But I do not like having your wits , " said the black dog . " I detest them cordially . They are forcing me at this very instant to tell you that your main trouble is aphasia . You forget things . " " I can not concede that , black dog , for I do not rememberanything I have forgotten . " " You forget , for example , " said the unhappy black dog  --  who was now being compelled , willy-nilly , to use Smirt 's intelligence just as Smirt had formerly used it  --  " that the Gallitzin Tunnel through the AlleghanyMountains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3600 feet long . " " In fact , " said Smirt , with some show of interest , " why should any human life be longer than a tunnel ? I had not thought of the matter in that light . But , now my own wits have pointed it out , I can see that if my life were just 3600 feet long I would be in a sad taking . " Then the black dog began to smile in a way which , somehow , appeared equivocal , and he wagged his white tail with contentment . " Moreover , Smirt , " said the black dog , " you forget that the metal chromium was discovered and isolated by Vauquelin in 1797 . " " Whereas I am not isolated at all ! " said Smirt , brightening still more . " I have never been isolated . So that I am far luckier than chromium , or than beryllium either , upon which Vauquelin played the same trick during the following year . " " Finally , Smirt , you forget that the chief interest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that state every cereal and other crop known to the north temperate zone . " " Whereas I am not the least bit interested in agri- culture ! " Smirt declared happily . " I never have been . Nor do I have to live in North Dakota , where , as I now recall , black dog , nine and six-tenths less fortu- nate people do have to live to every square mile . I would find it quite intolerable to have to associate every day with six-tenths of a person . And all this , just as you say , I am spared . Well , well , but there is nothing like logic : and it does pay , in the long run , to reason these things out to the bottom with one 's own wits . " " So now you see for yourself , " said the black dog . " Your wits have returned to you , and I am very well rid of them . But you , you will need all those precious wits of yours before the Spider Woman has done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpleasantly , in a way which Smirt did not think respectful , somehow , although that was hardly the immediate point . " The immediate point is , he is not a real dog . He has inside him no traditional love for mankind , but only bits of string . Moreover , his back lifts off . So of course he has to go back to the radiator in my writing room , " Smirt reasoned it out . " It would be wholly absurd to expect any such black wooden dogWHICH BECOMES LOGICALto remain here talking with me , because no species of dog can talk . " For now that Smirt had considered logically his good luck along with his bad luck , the Curse of Two Fortnights was lifted ; and along with his lost wits all Smirt 's urbanity had returned to him . He took out of his pocket the forty reis piece , and procured a fresh package of cigarettes , with the necessary matches , and he passed jauntily from the dead city of Ras Sem into the highest circles of philosophy. 178 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were restored to him , and he was once more a sound logician , Smirt went , rather as a matter of course , into the palace of Rani . The home of the South Wind 's third daughter was builded handsomely , out of the very best quality of paper ; by a great triumph of engineering , it was balanced upon a gilt weather-cock , in order that its inhabitants might not ever fall into set ways , or any paralyzing routine of life ; and into this variable , high palace the charms of the South Wind 's third daughter had uplifted the finest of existent minds , so that in this place her servitorscould observe and criticize the doings of time and chance without any bias . Nor was that everything : for the servants of Rani played in wide fields of thought . Hour in , and hour out , did her followers speak to one another , and to nobody else . And it was about every sociological matterwhich entered into the doings of time and chance18othat they spoke to one another , hour in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and chance would no doubt have found informative ; and inasmuch as none of these philosophers had ever for one instant listened to his fellows , all passed happily enough in the paper palace of Rani . " One perceives , " said Smirt , " that the humanities are well honored hereabouts , and that these are not ordinary philosophers . " A doctor of laws replied : " These , Smirt , are the wise followers of Rani . They think each man his own sociological thoughts , and they voice these thoughts without ever ceasing , who know that for such fine minds the universe and its contents are toys to be played with . " " Well , but , " said Smirt , " this savors of hubris , of that overweening pride which destroyed ( Edipus , and Prometheus , and so many other protagonists of Greek drama . Let us avoid hubris . Let us remember , gentlemen , that in point of fact it is the Stewards of Heaven who play with this special part of the universe and with all its contents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is but a gross and material consideration , " returned a lexicographer . " You remind me , sir , of my late fiancee Oriana  --  " " I remind you rather that such gods , if there be any 181SMIRTgods , have their divine will with our bodies ; but all we live snug and secure from such foolishness , each man abiding in the inmost nook of his own brain cells , thinking our sociological thoughts , and deriding the gods , who have no power over our minds . " Up went the eyebrows of Smirt , and his shoulders also went up , shruggingly ; but his doubtfulness stayed unspoken . He remarked , instead : " You reason adroitly . Yet has this continuous thinkingat any time revealed to you gentlemen why on earth the All-Highest ever created mankind ? For that one sociological problem does baffle me , I admit . I can not quite believe it was done solely for the diversionof Smirt  --  " " The possible intentions of his just not impossible Creator , " replied a grammarian , " is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endowed with certain qualities . To develop , and to make full use of , these qualities , in so far as stays convenient under the local police regulations , is his proper sociological course . It is a course which , in plain reason , could not anger any rational Creator under Whose direct supervision the hornet stings , the hawk murders , and the polecat is unpopular . " Then a pantologist said : " All human freedom consistsin the affirmation of the inevitable . Thus alone may one achieve teshuvah , the identification of one's182IN THE PAPER PALACEwill with the will of the All-Highest . Yet have not many psychologists equated this self-negation with a lack of self-esteem as a fairly constant element in the neuroses of an Hebraic windbag ? That is a weighty point ; that is fundamental stuff such as Ludwig Lewisohn publishes ; and people admire it . " " Moreover , in considering the All-Highest , and eschatology in general , " said a bachelor of science , " one must distinguish between the rude fables of antiquity and the refinements of polite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the sociology of Doomsday . The dead will then arise , we are informed , unchanged . I infer that all the blessed will arise with their bowels , which will undoubtedly continue to function . In Our Father 's house are many outhouses . Yes , there will be comfort stations in Paradise , with millions of rest rooms ; and it is a solemn thought to reflect upon the holy persons enthroned in them every morning . " " But each one of you , " said Smirt , " strays from the point , like a broken compass . I have asked a plain question , a question of some importance . And each one of you three has veered away from it , to reverberateanother question . " " How does it matter , Smirt ? " asked Rani , who was the lovely and erratic queen over all these philosophers . " Is it not better to be broad-minded ? " 183SMIRT " Well , now that all depends , " said Smirt . " There are far too many minds which broaden by the simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well to be broad-minded ; for otherwise , there is no telling . " The South Wind 's daughter regarded him pensively ; and pensively she began , you could see , to approve of her newest philosopher . Rani was clothed , to a certain extent at least , in a fine robe of transparent iridescent stuff , colored like the wings of a blue-bottle fly ; and this was embroidered with very small scarlet fig-leaves . Her golden head-dress had the quaint shaping of a coiled serpent with its head raised . Rani remarked , after a moment of appraising re-flection : " And besides , Smirt , if you and I were human , it might be we would need to trouble over these human problems . But as matters stand , they do not concern us , any more than we need to know why a dog must turn about in a circle before he lies down or why moths fly toward a lighted candle and destroy themselvesjoyfully . " " Yet I do know , Rani , about the King of Hearts and about barbers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Rani , standing a-tiptoe to pat his cheek , " you are Smirt the Peripatetic Episcopalian , 184IN THE PAPER PALACEand I am the South Wind 's own daughter . Let us be content with our high stations . " " Revered Rani , it is in a dream that we occupy these stations . And that makes a difference , it may be , " said Smirt , dubiously . " However , even in a dream it is pleasant to become a philosopher and to lead a contemplative life in this handsome palace of yours . Yes , it is quite gratifying to have so many superbminds forever at work to the right and the left of you , and to hear them delivering such valuable opinions about every topic unceasingly . It is still more gratifying  --  I need hardly say  --  to be cherished by a creature so lovable and so wholly lovely as you are , dear lady . " " Ah , but , " said Rani , " the best is yet to be . " And at that , Smirt shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dreaming was pleasant enough , Smirt reflected , in the good graces of Rani . None the less was it neces- sary to be firm when Rani talked about marriage and , a very little later , about dispensing with marriage . " These are suggestions which pain me , " Smirt told her . " It is true that your family owes me a wife , 0 daughter of the South Wind , but I have no need of a wife now that I have turned philosopher . No , there is Socrates who , being dead , yet speaketh , dehorting the philosophic from matrimony . No , these sugges- tions are the sort of thing which one expects from mortal women , and from goddesses also , but you , my adored Rani , are the supreme passion of my life , at this special instant ; and I do not propose to have the supreme passion of my life destroyed by any such antics . " " On the other hand  --  " said Rani . " Do you consider , 0 heart 's dearest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down beside Rani , on her double bed , in order to reason more comfortably , " do you consider the grotesque indignity of the performance you contemplate ! In no variant does it admit an element of gracefulness . It betrays one into a frame of mind which is neither tactful nor urbane . Indeed , it temporarily remits the intelligence ; and to do that is not good for a philosopher . Moreover , this performanceresults in sweat , in spasms , in slime , and in smells . It results , in brief , in the instant need of a bath . Yet it is in this horrible way that every woman expects a man to express his affection ! " " Nevertheless  --  " said Rani . " I can but suggest , " said Smirt , " that relatively few women possess any imagination . They resent , it may be , the male 's larger gift of imagination , which attainsits most epic proportions when the man is in love . They beguile him therefore into the inconsequentnotion that his imaginings have something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him that the most undignified goings-on , in a bed such as we now occupy , are the goal and the logical result of all his lofty imaginings . In this way do women manage to discredit the imagination of every man , sooner or later . And in this way also do women find for all abstract notions a common denominator , so that the justice of Airel , the piety of Oriana , and187SMIRTthe philosophy of Rani become indistinguishable the one from another . " " Still  --  " said Rani . " I present this theory , " said Smirt , " simply as an hypothesis . A learned author has remarked that no man quite understands women ; and he might well have added that in this respect women are far from unique , inasmuch as no man can quite understand anything . I can not understand , for example , why you do not keep your hands to yourself . I understand only that illusions are highly entertaining to Smirt . I must in consequence cherish my illusions ; and you , 0 my dearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course this special stage in my dream . " " Yet  --  " said Rani . " I can but entreat you , " said Smirt , " not to persuade , reason , moralize , dispute , wrangle , and bandy arguments , with such torrents of eloquence ; for my mind is made up . Yes , dear lady , it is quite pretty ; but then I have seen a great many of them , you know . " " But  --  " said Rani . " No , my darling , " said Smirt . " In the palace of Rani my pursuits shall be purely intellectual . Even in the bed of Rani I intend to remain upright and unadventurous . Meanwhile , if you insist on it , I do not mind kissing you in a purely philosophic way . " 188THE PHILOSOPHY OF RANIRani said nothing . But Smirt said , almost immediately : " Did I not stipulate in a purely philosophic way ' ? Ah , well , but Epicurus also was a philosopher ; and there is certainlysomething to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , Smirt was reflecting : " After all , this young woman is not Arachne . No ; I am still in the wrong legend ; and my quest , as yet , remains unfulfilled . " 18gSmirt left the bed of Rani and the delights of her paper palace without further delay . He quitted them in a jiffy ( which he preferred upon the whole to a trice , although neither of them was in appearance quite what Smirt had expected ) because Smirt 's honor was engaged in the quest of Arachne 's legend , and because the trivial pretty face of Arachne stayed always in Smirt 's thinking . He had promised , by no less than seven revered matters , to restore to this girl her lost estate in the lands beyond common-sense . It was a fact which debarred shilly-shallying . He must keep his promise , he deduced , with the unhesitancy of a sound logician , in a jiffy . But in a jiffy he found that her legend was not known at Camelot : no one of Arthur 's knights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smirt to that lost estate . Charlemagne and the twelve paladinswho were then in attendance upon Charle-190IS PAST IN A JIFFYmagne had heard no report of Arachne , nor had bland Bishop Turpin heard of her either . At Tara of the Kings , Fionn Mac Uail shook his wise head regretfully ; no , he had known many women , but never Arachne : at Tara , not even Diarmuid , whom all women cherished because of his love spot , had been pursued by Arachne , in so far as Diarmuid could remember . And at Bagdad it was the same disappointingstory : Haroun Alraschid was sympathetic , even cordial ; if Smirt wanted a woman , here were three dozen young virgins , each one of them more fair than the moon , at Smirt 's disposal : but of these unpiercedpearls , of these most lovely fillies not as yet tamed by any rider ( so Mesrour the head eunuch reported ) no one was Arachne . Nor when Smirt came to the court of Prester John in a jiffy could the kingbishopor any of the seventy-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , in a large hall hung with red panther skins , help Smirt in Smirt 's questing . Then , still in a jiffy , Smirt went about the kingdomof El Dorado , where the reigning monarch was oiled every morning and sprinkled all over with gold dust . And afterward Smirt visited the Hyperboreans , on the other side of the North Star . And in neither country could Smirt find the legend of Arachne . Then at Atlantis Smirt consulted , without any least191SMIRTsuccess , the supreme oracle of Poseidon , in a circular temple builded of ivory and of silver , and capped with tall pinnacles of gold and orichalc . Through four of the Fortunate Islands likewise did Smirt seek after Arachne 's legend without finding any trace of it . And Smirt travelled among more barbarous peoplestoo , among men that had the heads and the soft pendant ears of setter dogs , and among men who were shaped like eels , and among men who were so oddly constructed as to possess , each one of them in his own person , the organs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peoples could Smirt find the legend of Arachne . After that , Smirt questioned the Samoyeds , anotherremarkably hirsute nation , whose faces were upside down , and who shed their skins once a year . And Smirt questioned the Umeloi , the Hill-Dwellers , a black people with flaming red eyes and very bright yellow hair , who lived in elm-trees , in large eggshapednests made out of gaily colored bird feathers . And Smirt questioned also the terrible army of Gog and Magog , where they lay encamped in the Caucasus Mountains , waiting until the hour came for them to destroy all this world and to ravage the golden city of Jehovah . But everywhere Smirt questioned in vain . No one of these peoples had the desired legend , and no 192IS PAST IN A JIFFYlearned person with whom Smirt talked in the lands beyond common-sense could tell Smirt anything about the Arachne whose trivial pretty face stayed so obstinatelyin Smirt 's thinking . " It is needful , " said Smirt , " that something should be done at once about this unsatisfactory state of affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAIDNow the appearance of Arachne haunted Smirt , saying : " You have talked , and strutted , and talked ,  --  and then you have talked some more . But you have not ever found my legend , you have not restored to me any of my lost estate in these lands beyond commonsense , as you most faithfully promised you would do , when you swore a great oath by those curious gods of yours . " " That is true , Arachne . And for the rest , as a matter of course I have talked . One has to keep up the conversation . But I most certainly have not strutted . My modesty is proverbial . " Then the appearance of Arachne would smile somewhat . " It does not matter , " she said , cryptically . " I rather like it . " " In fact , Arachne , now that you have brought up the topic , modesty is a rare virtue . " " And it seems particularly praiseworthy , Smirt , in any Virginian gentleman who has so little to be modestabout , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that also is true ! You have a logical mind , my dear  --  " She had colored up deliciously . But she frowned also , saying , " To begin with  --  " " I know , " said Smirt . " But I do not apologize , because you really are my dear , at all events during this special stage of my dream . And in any case , I was only going on to observe that my virtues , whatsoever they may or may not happen to be , have thus far availed nothing . " " They have brought us two together , Smirt . It may be that before long , " the girl said , with an odd , an almost hungry look , " they will bring us a great deal more closely together . There is a quiet little place over yonder  --  " " It is that outcome which I desire , my darling , even though it be far more than has been merited by my wit , my fancy , my profundity , and by yet other mentalgifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to accredit me  --  oh , but beyond doubt , through that habitual excess of charity which distinguishesmost book reviewers ,  --  and to which , Arachne , I shall not further allude lest I appear boastful . Some day I must show you my press clippings. 194 195SMIRTNevertheless , and with all these talents , I have failed thus far , I repeat , in two quests . " " Your modesty really is , " she remarked , with conviction , " rather wonderful . But I do like it , somehow . I find it appetizing . And as I was saying , just over yonder  --  " " For I know , Arachne , " Smirt continued , " I know very well that I adore you . Yet I do not know anything else about you , inasmuch as I have not yet recoveredyour legend ; and I do not know who I may happen to be , either . That is the great drawback to having an over-vigorous and too inclusive mind . It is a mind , Arachne , which embraces a wide variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So we are both lost , my dearest , we are lost forever , I am very much afraid , in the encyclopedic dreaming of Smirt . " She appeared puzzled now ; and she protested ,  --  " But you yourself are Smirt  --  " " That is perhaps true , " he admitted . " It is a point upon which one necessarily reserves judgment . Yet who is Smirt ? " " Why , Smirt , " the girl replied triumphantly , " is you . " " I do not deny that , Arachne . At least , as a sound logician , I do not deny it outright . Yet I once dreamed , I must tell you , I dreamed , more or less like196THE WAY OF A MAIDthe philosopher Chuang Tzu , that I was a blue-bottle fly . I was then conscious only of my thoughts , my interests and my beliefs as a blue-bottle fly , and unconsciousof my present individuality as a man . I awoke from that dream , and it seemed to me I was myself again  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like lovely saucers . " And why , dear Smirt , should you not be yourself again , after you had waked up , when it was probably just something you ate ? And that reminds me  --  " " But do you not see my dilemma , Arachne ? I cannotbe certain whether I belong to the Mammalia or to the Diptera . Still , I do not know whether I was at that time the Peripatetic Episcopalian dreaming I was a blue-bottle fly , or whether I am at this time a blue-bottle fly dreaming I am the Peripatetic Epis-copalian . " Then Arachne said , " But all that is nonsense . " " Is it ? " Smirt asked , with unconcealed dubiety . " I am not sure . Only a woman is ever sure . And that is because the more honest of you do not pretend to a sense of humor . " " All your devisings are nonsense , " Arachne continued . " You play  --  like a great dear baby  --  with your plain out-and-out nonsense , and with your silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your words , so197SMIRTthat no other person can get in even one word edgewise . And yet I rather like that too , somehow . For how could anybody possibly be a blue-bottle fly ? " " I was about to say  --  " Smirt began to answer . But the girl interrupted him , saying shyly : " Ah , but let us not talk any longer in this open road , with people coming and going , and staring at us so all the time . For just over yonder there is a littleparlor , Smirt , a very quiet neat place , where we could talk quite undisturbed , if only I could trust you not to attempt any liberties such as we might both regret afterward , because you really do have such a way with you , dear Smirt , that a girl feels utterly helpless  --  " " You wrong me , my darling .

And meanwhile I was about to say  --  when you interruptedme , Arachne , and began to rub up against me like a kitten in this way , which , although highly agreeable , does rather interfere with our conversation  --  Iwas about to say , I repeat , that no man can live happily with any woman who cultivates a sense of humor . It is a fact for which five explanations occurto me  --  " THE WAY OF A MAID " Then do you explain them to yourself at leisure , dear Smirt , now that I am going out of the lands beyondcommon-sense , in which I have no estate and no legend . " And with that , the pouting and slightly disappointedlooking appearance of Arachne vanished , as irresponsibly as it had arrived . " Come now , " said Smirt , " but this will never do .

Bersdnov , Kaleki Perekhozhie , he turns round the oaks and the mountains , like Vertodub and Vertogor . Nevertheless , these byliny may be ranked as fictions : i. e. as facts of real life ( as then understood ) , applied to non-existent , unvouched , or legendary individuals . " THIRTY-SIXREFLECTIONS OF THE MASTERNow the Shining Ones sat at the ramparts of their supernal home , busied with all sorts of romance makingin the approved manner of Smirt . And Smirt , their acknowledged master , the chief of this planet 's gods , meditated alone in his temple . Since he could not find the legend of Arachne , he must make her a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile , when once he had got together the tools of his thaumaturgy , and had ready his paper and his carbon ink and his customary black pen , he found that a number of more or less irrelevant matters invadedhis divine mind , to delay creativeness ; and about these matters he thought perforce , just to get them out of the way , so that he could settle down to his work with undivided attention . He did not , he reflected , think about that mortal woman Jane who had been his wife upon Earth , and who had died a great long while ago . He thought , 203SMIRTinstead , about the churchyard of St.-Peter's-in-theLast , in Oxford , and of its serene beauty under a June sunset ; about what had happened , so delightfully , to Janet Ormerod and Smirt , in the south doorwayof this church , a rich specimen of Norman work , badly obscured by the porch with a parvise , or upper story , characteristic of the fifteenth century ; about the curious etymology of the word " hearse " ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card cases , toothbrushes , cheese , zinc , and Spanish cedar , whether in logs or in sawn planks . He thought about a dusty disused room and the ancient odors , suggesting an embalmed body , of that room 's blue-and-gray-striped , bare mattress , in the while that he and Mrs. Murgatroyd were misbehavingthemselves ; about how odd it was that in his presentdream his power to smell anything appeared to have been remitted ; and about the disruption of the Whig party in 1852 , when General Winfield Scott carried only four states . With these matters disposed of , Smirt laid out upon the table ten sheets of writing paper ; he scratched his nose ; he uncorked his ink bottle ; and he sat thinking for a few moments . Smirt did not think about Jane . To the contrary ( as he noted , with continued approval of such abstinence ) he thought about Beerbohm Tree 's fine204REFLECTIONS OF THE MASTERproduction of King Henry the Eighth , at His Majesty'sTheatre in 1911 , and about the young girl who played Anne Bullen kneeling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long neck bent far forward , just as it would bend later over the executioner 's block ; and about how it was another Jane , a Jane Seymour , who had caused this . He thought about the gargoyles upon Notre Dame ; about the silver ring he had bought at the first World 's Fair ; about the WashingtonPost March ; about how at college he saw a road company act Othello , and how he coupled later in the night with the woman who had acted the part of Roderigo ; about how very pleasant was the combination of Bartlett pears with Gruyere cheese ; about how odd it was that , thus far in his dream , he had gone continuously without food ; and about an immoral and philosophic Swiss waiter at a small hotel in the small Rue d'Alger , just off the Rue de Rivoli . Then Smirt thought about Marian , a white blur in her nightgown , as they both waited at their bedroomdoors , immediately across the hall from each other , to make sure that the rest of the house was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both in the stock market and elsewhere ; about Florence , her perfect body , in which Smirt had been able to find no flaw anywhere except in the slight grossness of her wrist and her ankles , and about her205SMIRTextraordinary tumescence ; and about how droll it was that only 261 words should be spoken by Lady Macbeth during the entire tragedy . After that , Smirt dipped his pen in the ink ; he attempted to remove a non-existent small hair , or it might have been a non-existent dust grain , from the point of his pen , with the fore-finger and the thumb of his left hand ; and he sat for a while thinking . Smirt did not think about Jane . He thought about the tax blank ( Form III6 ) upon which you figured out the allowed deduction for royalties already taxed in foreign countries ; about how very carefully the Federal Government and the Supreme Court had cooperatedto promote disloyalty among authors by taxingthem with less rationality and with less fairness than were taxed the followers of any other profession ; about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon that which his eyes alone of living eyes had seen , when the bright shield of young Perseus reflected the face of Medusa ; about an anemone noticed in the spring of 1897 ; about fireflies loitering over a meadow just beyond a railway bridge in the same year of grace ; and about goldfish , including comets , shobunkins , moors , telescopes , and fantails . He thought about prose made fine and elaborate ; about Mona Lisa 's seniority to the rocks among which she sits , about Ecclesiastes and Isaiah , about the quin-206REFLECTIONS OF THE MASTERtessence of dust , about just , mighty and subtle opium , about the drums and tramplings of three conquests , and about the sedulous ape ; about American literature , from its acknowledged masterpieces all the way up to mediocre writing ; about warm water and mustard , and the better-thought-of book reviewers , and the unfairness of some few of them in compelling you to like them as persons ; about that little dark-haired Jeanne , who , for all that she had made away with Smirt 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like white apples , and had so justified Theocritus ; about a boy whom Smirt had found to be even more wonderful than himself , dead long ago of tuberculosis ; about A Toccata of Galuppi 's , about Cranford , about Proverbs in Porcelain , about Kenneth Grahame 's books , and about Chastelard ; and about death , which ended all mirth and prettiness utterly , and which made such an excellent literary theme . Then Smirt looked for and found a small black and yellow blotter , upon which was printed " Promote Prosperity with Printer 's Ink , " and this blotter he laid upon the topmost sheet of his nice clean writing paper , so that the oil from his hand would not soil this paper while he was writing on it ; and he sat for a while thinking . Smirt did not think about Jane . He thought about how Troilus was rescued by his actual father , Phoebus207SMIRTApollo , from the sword of death-dealing Achilles , and was made immortal , and how Troilus could not find upon Olympus , or upon earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him as was all-hateful Cressida ; and how the young demigod returned to her , who was an old woman now , well wasted away in leprosy , and so found contentment . Smirt thought about Athennus and astigmatism and the Washington Monument and the old-fashioned saloon . He thought , also , about how Lady Jane Crawley ( nee Sheepshanks ) after Sir Pitt 's death , did not , in so far as Smirt remembered , marry en secondes notes either Frederick the Great or Nebuchadnezzar . Next Smirt thought about katydids , and about the large mole far up on the inside of the left leg of Mrs. Murgatroyd , and about that black-painted tin sign , very rough to the touch , like sandpaper , with gilt letterson it proclaiming that Smirt 's father was Attorney at Law ; about the green looking dust which buttercupsleave upon black shoes ; about the knight 's move at chess , and about Stonehenge ; and about the Man in the Iron Mask ( but one had so much wanted Aramisto win out ) , and about the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the two positionsof the American flag on Memorial Day . After that , Smirt dipped his pen in the ink for the second time , and he noted with approval how very208REFLECTIONS OF THE MASTERcleverly he had controlled his thoughts , keeping them away from any unprofitable and misleading topic . For Smirt did not ever , he assured himself , think about the mortal woman Jane who had been his wife upon Earth . He thought only about Jane Eyre , and about Jane Austen , and about Lady Jane , the contraltosinger in Patience ; about Jane Shore and about Lady Jane Grey and about Jeanne Du Barry ; about Joan of Arc , and reverting to fiction , about Jeanie Deans and about Jehane de St. Pol and about Jenny Wren , the doll 's dressmaker ; about Jane Addams and about Jeanne d'Albret ; about Joan of Navarre , the witch queen , and about wicked Joanna of Naples , and about insane Joanna of Spain , and about Pope Joan , and about Beatrice-Joanna also , in Middleton 's Changeling . " It is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that William Rowley wrote some part of this play . " Then he laid down his black pen without having written one least word of the legend of Arachne , and Smirt buried his face in both his arms , and he began to sob , convulsively , without shedding any tears , becauseJane had been taken away from him . " Master of the Gods , " said a girl 's voice , " I am called Jane Doe . " " That is a legal fiction ; and I prefer Arachne , " Smirt answered. 209SMIRTHe had lifted his divine head , and Smirt the supremegod sat staring rather forlornly at this schoolgirl. "  --  And , Master of the Gods , I have come into your temple to worship you by asking a few questions . " " I remember that there was once a princess , " Smirt replied , as he climbed up on his pedestal , " and you also , my child , I seem to remember , but in a different role . " 210THIRTY-SEVENLITURGY OF WORSHIPTherefore , " Smirt continued , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for I am under bonds to devise the legend of Arachne . " " In one instant , Master of the Gods , " replied Jane Doe , as she knelt down before Smirt on his pedestal ,  --  " for I quite comprehend that you are a busy deity now that you are devising the legend of Arachne . But the members of my class in comparative religion have been asked to get in touch with a number of prominentdeities of this country , and as a member of my class in comparative religion I have chosen you from a list of the prominent deities of this country . I know that as one of the prominent deities of this country in the profession of creating you are quite busy , but I would appreciate it very much if you would have the kindness , as one of the most prominent deities of this country , to answer me a few questions about your professionof creating .

Before you became one of the most prominentdeities in this country why did you take up creatingas a profession ? Now that you are one of the most prominent deities in this country , to what do you attribute your success as one of the most prominentdeities in this country in creating as a profession ? How do you advise young people who want to take up creating as a profession to get started in creatingas a profession and to become one of the most prominent deities in this country who are engaged in creating as a profession ?

Yes , my child , it all depends . And now do you pardon me , for I must get back to work upon the legend of Arachne . " And Smirt raised his hand in a gesture somewhere between a blessing and a farewell. 212LITURGY OF WORSHIP " Yet as one of your most devout worshippers , " replieda professor of biology , as he too knelt before Smirt 's pedestal , " I think it imperative , now that you have taken up creative work , for you to present to our university an autographed Arachne . We now have over 2 500 creations , each and every one of which bears the name of the gifted and gift-giving deity who made it up out of his own head . We beseech you , whensoever you visit China , to honor with a brief epiphany the splendid student body of the University of Wen-Ching . We entreat you , 0 Master of the Gods , to devote a day or two to the scenic beauties of Peeping . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Smirt . " I mean , Divine Master , " the kneeling professor repliedreverently , " that the University of Wen-Ching , in Peeping , China , is American supported . " " Even in its grammar , " Smirt assented . " I mean also , Divine Master , that by many authorities Wen-Ching is regarded as a most importantfactor in the development of our next generation . Although founded as a Christian institution , and though loyally supported by every denominationalmissionary , the activities and teaching of WenChingare approved by non-Christian leaders likewise . Wen-Ching is co-educational . Through all213SMIRTthe national disorders of recent years Wen-Ching , under the untiring supervision of Professor Morecock , has gone along undisturbed . It follows that we all think you ought to honor us with an epiphany at Peeping ; and we find it obligatory for you to send us , by to-day 's post , an autographed Arachne .

So pray permit me to straighten your coat sleeve . Look a little to the left , with the chin the least bit farther up , if you do not mind , and now , just a trifle more pleasant , please , splendid , that will do nicely , you can see the proofs Tuesday morning .

"  --  Upon which , " the young man continued , " you can finish the legend of Arachne in no time at all . Your photographs and your letter will be reproduced and distributed to twenty thousand Imperial dealers , from coast to coast , and we will tie in with your publishersto advertise the legend of Arachne as one of our products . " " But , " Smirt repeated , " before that I must create the legend of Arachne .

" " Will you not give me a signed photograph ? " asked the baker , " for I think very highly of the legend of Arachne . It grips the reader . " " In this manuscript , " said the candlestick maker , " I have set forth my views upon Sovietism , sin , silver , suicide , Siam , and civic sanitation . I believe that this manuscript will peculiarly appeal to the gifted creator of the legend of Arachne . So do you kindly read it , and make the necessary alterations , not later than next Wednesday , and then tell me to what publisher I ought to send it . " Thereupon came bustling into Smirt 's temple Tom , and Dick , and Harry , along with Madame Quelquechose and Senora Etcetera and Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world and his wife , and Mrs. Murgatroyd came also . " Master of the Gods , " said Tom , Dick and Harry , speaking in unison , " now that we are eighteen , sex has become very wonderful to us , and we desire to talk about it . We think , Master , that there is something about great minds such as you and we possess which remains eternally naive : only fools become accustomed to miracles . The Puritan , the dunce , and the rustic start out by sneering ; they end by accept-216ing mutely . The radio , the Venus of Milo , the elec. tric light , the overture to Tannhauser , Arcturus , fornication , and Christopher Marlowe are all very obviousto such lost souls . But the genius says : ' I do not understand how it is possible . Of course I must believe , because I can see and hear , but it remains none the less incredible . ' Because he has genius he lives in unending wonder . The fool quickly accepts and as quickly forgets . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which Smirt sighed a trifle impatiently . " Ah , but why not , " said Smirt , " take something else ? Why do you striplings not ever take anything else as your hackneyed theme ? " " Because , Master , " replied Tom , Dick and Harry , " the ordinary man flops on the most beautiful of all beautiful things , the female body ; he assaults it with his own body ; he tumbles off : and he forgets the entirematter , all in five minutes . But a genius can pour out all his libido on the altars of Venus and never fail to be puzzled , to be filled with a glorious wonderment , or to be amazed always anew . The miracle fascinateshim ; it arouses both unbelief and a passionate adoration . He likes it ; he wants to do it again . That , Master , is what we think about sex . That is why we believe that each one of us four is a genius . Are we not right ? " 217SMIRTSmirt inclined his divine head gravely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , it all depends , my dear lads . In any event , your dicta upon this most vital and highly important subject are of such interest that I must now avert from them with a great deal of sincere regret , in order that I may create the legend of Arachne . And so , some other day perhaps  --  " " Whenever I talk with people who have read only the legend of Arachne , " Senora Etcetera declared  --  " whereas I of course have read all your books , over and yet over again  --  then I get rattle-headed . It seems to me that they have not found in your books what I have found . Which proves , does it not , that I am more sensitively sensitized ? Yes , oh , yes indeed ! Some people have wicked minds . You are naughty at times , 0 Master of the Gods , but I worship you wholeheartedly , because you are amusing at all times , which is the very nicest thing that a god can be . " " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " remarked Madame Quelquechose , " and I wish that you could be wholly mine . Of course you do not really exist . You are just a beautiful dream I have dreamed . " " Do you think so ? " said Smirt , dubiously : for this notion seemed rather to complicate matters . " Oh , but beyond doubt , " replied Madame Quelquechose ; " and I am glad of that , too , because in real218LITURGY OF WORSHIPlife I am deeply in love with a quite different kind of person . Monsieur Quelquechose thinks most highly of him . So he fits into my reality ; but you fit into the dream . " " Yes , Smirt the supreme god is a dream , " said Lady Ampersand , " and I am his living quotation . Every time my lips part in talking , his sweet words fall therefrom . If that wicked girl in the fairy tale had but read the fine books of Smirt , she might so easily have dropped his lovely words instead of those horrid toads . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Murgatroyd . " I think his books are perfectly wonderful . I am very proud to have known him before he became divine . I tell everybody about him . I simply can not imagine what it was I saw in Murgatroyd . " " I also , " said the world 's wife , " I have dreamed about the beautiful high brow , the dark Byronic curls , the refined Grecian nose , the firm chin , and the sensitive mouth which reveals only enough to make its hearers hungry for yet more of Smirt. 0 lovely Master of the Gods , I am wholly glad that I dreamed you . Now do you tell us about your philosophy of life . " Then they all cried out confusedly : " What will be the future trend of Southern literature ? " 219SMIRT " Do you compose on the typewriter ? Do you dictate ? And do you write in the morning or in the evening ? " " Is alcohol injurious , and are we , or are we not , upon the verge of a vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your own books do you like best ? " " What about correspondence courses in short story writing , who is your favorite author , and ought children to be taught to believe in Santa Claus ? Why is the American Spectator ? Do you write every day or do you wait for inspiration to move you ? " " What , Smirt , are your religious beliefs in not over two hundred words ? What constitutes your ideal of true womanhood ? When is your next book to appear and what are you going to call it ? " All these questions they asked confusedly without waiting for any answer . And all the while , too , the public at large became more pallid . The colors went out of their faces and out of their hair and out of their clothing also . They became like ghosts , nor were they any longer distinct in outline . They were like blown tatters of fog , they were like mere cigarette smoke , now that , very much as Airel and Elair had vanished , so did a wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public at large ; but as they passed out of Smirt 's tern-220LITURGY OF WORSHIPplc they still shrilled and chirped and twittered their questions . " Master of the Gods , " said the young girl who remained in Smirt 's temple , " I am called Dorothy  --  " " I prefer Arachne , " Smirt answered , sighing . "  --  And , Master , you did not ever answer my letter  --  aboutyour lecturing . " " I remember that there was once a princess , " Smirt said , with sigh number two , " and you also , my child , I seem to remember , but in a different role . " 221THIRTY-EIGHT *A LECTURE FOR DOROTHYI remember you perfectly ( Smirt continued . ) Writingin behalf of the two literary societies of your college , you , my dear Dorothy , have asked if , and when , and at what fee per evening , I would agree to lecture in your college auditorium , as to whatsoever topic I may elect  --  although you aidfully added you were certain that " a message " from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest to the students , the faculty , and their friends ,  --  and you have asked also that I advise you whether " anything along this line " would be " worth my while . " To be frank with you ( Smirt went on , as he lighted a fresh cigarette , and leaned back , rather more comfortably , on his pedestal ) it would not be worth my while  --  nor your while either . I still marvel , with an aged and resigned wonder , at the quaint notion that some possible profit is to be got , by anybody concerned , from inducing the professional man of letters222A LECTURE FOR DOROTHYto lecture . You would not ask in just this off-hand fashion , I imagine , that same author to perform upon the college auditorium piano , before the students , the faculty , and their friends , or to adorn the auditoriumwalls with mural paintings . You would incline , first , to make sure of his musical gifts or of his ability to paint . Nor  --  and this is an analogue even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear , upon a set evening , before the students , the faculty , and their friends , and thereupon to enliven the gathering by singing Celeste Aida or The Last Rose of Summer . The singer and the author ( along with the actor , the lecturer , and the crossword-puzzle maker ) do utilize a common material , in that each of them employs words ; and yet , after hardly more than a half-hour 's steady thinking about this matter , you will begin to divine , my dear Dorothy , that all these persons use words variously , in accord with the tenets and the limitations of perceptibly different arts . I grant that members of a race so multifarious as to produce both men and women may be able in more than one art . It is humanly possible , I mean , for an author to " speak " passably : but the event is rare . Looking back through a long and terrible vista of auctorial lectures , I can recall one woman writer who " spoke " ( upon I have no least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as kept me through a contented hour 's length mentally purring . I delight , because of that well-nigh unique memory , to recognize , in Zona Gale , an actually accomplished writer who actually could " speak , " and with whom " speaking " was a fine art finely practised . To the other side , without any unwise name-calling , I think of a woman who had published sundry volumes of the most bland and charming essays ever penned by an American , and of her dictatorial , her sullen , and her gross conduct of the one lecture I was fated to hear her deliver . That was an all-tragic afternoon , which robbed me forever of any further pleasure in the writings of an over large and regrettably vocal snapping turtle . The epiphany of this harridan remains to me , I repeat , a continued distress  --  and yet , only in degree . For how many other soul-chilling , how many haggardlyvivacious females do I recall , all of whom " spoke " upon the inconsequent ground that they knew more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books afterward ! As to male authors , I clap one hand on my heart , and rest the other hand on the family Bible , in the while I protest that every one of them whom I have heard " speak " showed then at his worst . Even did he orate smoothly , without fidgets , without forlornly224A LECTURE FOR DOROTHYclearing his throat , and without too often seeking respite in the ice-water pitcher , yet did his inane utterance glister , as it were , with the greasy highmindednessand the tin-plated goodfellowship which no public speaker can very well avoid . In most cases this did not matter , because the majority of persons who write badly enough to be in demand as lecturers are charlatans or bunglers at all seasons : but to observebedizened in any such humbug the man of real talent is painful . It is painful because there drift about , in that more rarefied air of the platform , some fumes , some strayinggases , which affect the intelligence . A few victims these effluvia reduce to gulping , to the conscientious coughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more hapless they intoxicate coram populo . And as a pragmatic people , we have learned to accept this fact . We do not note , as a rule , how wildly does the babblement made upon platforms by the habitues of this dire eminence differ from the at least relatively sane speech of our school-teachers and our politicians and our clergy in their private life . It is tacitly understood by everybody that , when " speaking , " the professional " speaker " expects his sentimentsto be received at a liberal discount , and upon this full dress occasion will introduce no one of his beliefs in their working clothes. 225SMIRT A LECTURE FOR DOROTHYAll oratory I , in brief , ( with the appropriate glibnessof a person who knows nothing whatever about it ) assume to be an art with its own formal conventions . But I am certain it is an art through which none may attain to self-expression ; and in this respectit differs by a world 's width from authorship . I mean that the writer , at his desk , so long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that somewhere outside the door of his study an intelligentand sympathetic audience , well worth all painstaking , awaits his masterpiece . To that " acute but honorable minority " he can address himself freely , with glad confidence , and without compromise . Let no such happy man turn lecturer ! I entreat , with an emotion , you may note , which rises naturally into blank verse . For when once this misled visionary mounts the platform , he becomes conscious that no supermen assemble to honor him . His flesh and blood audience is not even , in any real sense , sympathetic : at best , it stays receptive , waiting to be wooed , waiting to be roused into approval of him , by its own standards . He perceives , too , that this audience ( in common with any audience ever assembled anywhere ) is not , or at least is not pre-eminently , intelligent . As a whole it very much prefers , it demands , and it visibly awaits , those sleek false formule which thewise honor with lip service in public . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and after loosing this trial balloon of fancy he is soon well under way in imaginative truckling . I have been privileged at odd times to sit , serene and dutiless , upon the rostrum whence some less lucky author was presently to address his public ; and I have considered his raw material . Not ever did the spectacle prove exhilarating : never did I covet his job . To be applauded by such people seemed to me , in all honesty , compromising . Sloth , and ostentation , and a timid lechery , and light-headedness , and self-conceit , and disapproval , and inattention , and boredom , I found over-plainly inscribed on the raised faces turned usward . And in yet more liberal quantities , of course , was to be seen gaping at us that dullmindednesswhich continues to betray an uncoerced people into paying for , and even into using , tickets for a lecture . Now I daresay , my dear Dorothy , that these are the prevailing traits in any human assemblage , of the better sort , when one views it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome , it is to just this partiallycultured audience every American artist must appeal . But my point is that the American author who is seduced into lecturing can not any more evade226 227SMIRTthis discouraging fact , inasmuch as night after night he encounters a roomful of his own atrocious admirers , in the persons of you and of the other flibbertigibbetstudents and of the depressed faculty and of their frowsy friends  --  and , in brief , of the public at large . He regards perforce this squatted herd of Mammaliaat close range ; and no further delusion is possible . Here are the butcher , the baker , and the candlestick maker , here are Tom , Dick and Harry , but above all here are Madame Quelquechose and Senora Etcetera and Lady Ampersand and Mrs. Murgatroyd . The dream-vendor  --  the purveyor of all beautiful and lofty imaginings , the promoter of divinedissatisfactions  --  stands face to face with the public at large . He sees immediately before him his paymasters , in the sensual , the bored , the chuckleheaded , and the smug middle-classes of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whims he and his famousness and all our national art are dependant , at the last pinch . The point is , furthermore , that no intelligent personin such circumstances will elect to speak with intelligence . Instead , " subdued , " as the phrase runs , " to what he works in , " he will cannily assume the thin virtues , the high-minded illogic , and the false good-humor which all better-thought-of Americans228A LECTURE FOR DOROTHYadmire ; he will prattle ; and he will thus earn his lecturefee honestly , by purveying the sane and edifying entertainment he promised . But the more wise , the more cautious writer , remainssnug in his study , at play with his words , and happily imagining that he addresses an all-worthy audience . That audience is in some sense the masterworkof every writer 's invention . That audience does not exist anywhere in flesh , and at bottom he knows this . But in his bemused fancy that audience exists clearly enough throughout the while that he writes , and for that while it contents him. i229THIRTY-NINETHE OLD DIFFICULTYThen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl Dorothy , when Smirt had ended his speaking , " are you not contented ? " " But I am contented , " said Smirt . " Did I not just tell you that it contents me to imagine I have my suitably appreciative audience ? " " And why , " this crop-headed , red-haired girl continued , " do you tell lies ? " Smirt looked at her ; and he smiled slowly . Smirt said : " Because I am not any longer young , my dear . For a middle-aged person of my special sort there is no refuge except lying . He must persuade himself at least , and if possible other people , that he has attainedsomething which does not exist . " " And what is that thing , Master ? " " But I have just told you , " Smirt replied , " that this never found thing is an appreciative and worthy audi-230THE OLD DIFFICULTYence . Young people do not have to bother about this requirement , because every young person is his own audience . You may tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that you speak truthfully you will no doubt believe for some years to come . A young man , at all events , regards himself with unfailinggusto , with a delight and a reprehension which are vivid ; he perceives that the one creature with whom he is familiar is an interesting creature . Ah , but by-and-by , out of the kindness of his heart , out of altruism , a young man here and there desires to revealthis absorbingly interesting creature to his fellow beings ; and the rest of that no longer young man 's life becomes a continued failure in this attempt . So does each one of us who is in some sort an artist seek his audience ; and no one of us ever finds it . " " I do not understand you , Master . Everybody has an audience whenever she needs an audience . People look at me and they listen to me  --  or at least the young men do  --  " " They would , my dear , for you have a clear complexionand fine lips and nothing whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your praise , because thinking is a fungus growth which rapidly infects youth and destroys it . " Dorothy , smiling a little , looked up at Smirt sidewise . She said by-and-by , 231SMIRT " And is it good to be young , Master ? " " I do not know , " Smirt returned , after weighing the matter rather carefully . " For it is uncomfortable to be young , and it is silly to be young , and it is unsatisfactoryto be young no longer . " " I do not understand that , " said the girl , pondering , " for a thing must be either good or bad . " Smirt looked at her ruefully . " You , " he remarked , " you are the sort of audience I find everywhere . It is to people who believe such untrue and immoral axioms that I must try to explain Smirt . It is like trying to explain the principles of wireless telegraphy to a deaf and dumb Abyssinian , to a person who does not know any more about the language I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general way , of course , I have followed its evolution down to the present day , from the theoretical work of Clerk Maxwellin 1865 , and the first experimental proofs of Heinrich Hertz in 1887 ; but I do not pretend to be an expert in wireless telegraphy . No , I am merely Smirt : I have my good and bad moral qualities , very much as I have my teeth and my knack for phrase making , but I am neither virtuous nor wicked , any more than I am dental or verbal . " " But  --  " said the red-haired girl . " No , my child , you are quite wrong . No , I am Smirt , I am a special and indivisible medley , a mixTHEOLD DIFFICULTYture in which , I pause to assure you , my egotisms are neither more nor less an ingredient than are my bicuspids or my epigrams . And I can not communicateSmirt , I can not make him comprehensible to the dull-minded gods or to the flighty-minded public at large . That , child , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find for myself no really appreciativeaudience in the universe as it is now constituted ; and that I must put up with being worshippedby adorers who do not even know what I am talking about . " Whatever had been on the tip of Dorothy 's tongue , you now saw , she had reconsidered saying it . The girl asked , instead , " Yet is it necessary , Master , always to be talking about yourself ? " " But of course , dear child , that is necessary ; that is unavoidable . For I am an artist . And every artist has his own special temperament which colors his work , his perceptions , his thoughts , his doings , and his talking , with an unique tinge . He perceives nothing , he can think about nothing , and of course he speaks nothing , which is not in some degree egoistic . Homer , in brief , is always Homeric . " The girl Dorothy reflected . " And is it good to be an artist ? " " Why , but how should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else . I would put it that the lark turns to his singing inevitably , because both he and it are larks ; and he does not speculate whether he might have lived more contentedly as a horse , or it might be as a hippopotamus , in so far at least as any lark has discussed the matter with me personally . " Now the girl shook her sleek round red head in a forlorn fashion . And she said : " No , Master of the Gods , I do not understand you . For it seems to me that you talk nonsense , that you are at large pains to talk nonsense  --  " " That is urbanity , " Smirt pointed out . " It is a sort of armor. " "  --  And yet , under it all , you are unhappy , Master of the Gods . At no instant are you freed of unhap-piness . " " And that , my dear , " said Smirt lightly , " is logic . For I have only my disciples , who make parodies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of anthems . " She came to him , touching his hand . " Can I not help you , Master ? " Now his mouth widened at each end , a trifle uglily , he suspected , like the mouth of a mastiff . Smirt spoke with deliberate harshness . " For ten minutes , Dorothy , or it might be for the quarter of an hour , I could make use of you . I could234THE OLD DIFFICULTYemploy you as one does a drug . You are young . You are female . That suffices . " She replied gravely : " Let it suffice . For it is not right that you should be unhappy , Master of the Gods . " He looked A her then in half quizzical admiration . " These are suggestions which pain me , " Smirt said . " You are an idiot . Compassion is not really the same thing as justice and piety and philosophy . Yet I am nine-tenths  --  no , I am ninety-nine-hundredths  --  in love with you . For that reason I shall not defile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I should be unhappy . And I shall get along , somehow , so long as I avoid hubris . " After that , Smirt kissed the girl Dorothy , with cool and urbane affection . Then he dismissed her from his temple , saying , " Get along with you ! swoosh ! shoo ! "  --  Which was all very well , Smirt reflected ; and which displayed that proper respect for womanhood such as graces any Southern gentleman who is past his prime . The only trouble was that the girl 's talking had revealed to Smirt his pre-eminent need to be rid of Smirt 's pre-eminence. 235PART SEVENTOUCHES POETIC JUSTICE " No specific reason can be assigned for the disappearance of the terms thou , " thee ' and thine ' from current speech . These words were familiar usage in Old English , but during the Middle English period were gradually supersededby the plural you ' ( or ye ' ) and your .

It is not only that I can find nowhere upon earth , nor in any supernal region to which I have yet had access , my fit audience . It is not only that even in Amit the public at large pursue me with the slur of fond admiration , and instead of delighting in my wit , my profundity , and my graceful prose style , delight only in my opinions as to topics about which I have no opinions . These troubles I can face with philosophy : they are common to all persons of genius . Another trouble goes deeper . Another trouble is unique . I alone of creative artists have been afflicted with divinedisciples , and the Shining Ones have caught my manner far too successfully . All is urbanity and lovelinessand topsy-turvy folk-lore and wellbred despair , with Smirtlings travelling toward all points of the compass upon irrational quests . All human life has become a bare-faced plagiarism from my books . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
