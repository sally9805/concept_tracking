txt A. few years ago former Prime Minister BALDWIN , in a stirring address qo president of the British Classical Association , described the procession of nations which passed the torch of learning on to the Ultimi Britanni . Rome , after running her mighty race , " holding her torch on high , " surrendered it into other hands because there were not enough Romans left to carry on . Mr. BALDWIN confessed to fears which took " grisly shape in the twilight that " the Great War by its destruction " of the best lives in such numbers " had not left enough of the breed to carry on the work of the Empire . Such fears have been dispelled by the splendid united endeavor of those who survived . One has even more admiration for the Ultimi Britanni when a view is given of the Primal . Britanni , as was done on Monday at the opening of the British Association for the Advancement of Science by the president of the geological section . The startling statement was made that " the Thames ran kit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sea level was much lower along the shores of Western Europe , and the North Sea was dry land . The savage ancestor of the Britisher could presumably walk dry-shod from Dover ' to Boulogne , or make his way by water in his roughly hewn boat or raft from London to Frankfort . And there was no torch of learning held high in hand . No frescoed caves tell of the culture that showed itself in the more kindly climate of Southern France . " Ding " in his cartoon " Cheer Up : Things Have Been a Lot Worse " has suggested the doom of which these prehistoric men lived in peril  --  the creeping down of the ice from the north . Their skeletal remains and crud , est of stone implements are found with the bones of the animals they hunted ( " or fled from " )  --  the elephant , hippopotamus and rhinoceros , or , later , with the reindeer and mammoth as the ice returned . So , as the geologist has read the story , " the " advance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " retreats and advances of the gla " cial ice fields . " The successive improvements in the workmanship of his flint indicated the steps in his cultural advance . The Mediterranean road described by Mr. BALDWIN was " infinitely hard , " but it seems far easier than the road by which the earliest men of Britain won their way from the edge of the ice to the cathedral city of York , where the latest men of Britain take counsel for the world 's advancement through science . The Ultimi Britanni have not yet arrived . Ex-President COOLIDGE , looking backward , now declares that in the Winter of 1928-29 it was " apparent " that speculation was reaching dangerous heights . He states : " I was alarmed at it . " If so , he kept the alarm very much to himself . One of the danger signals at the time was the dizzy increase in brokers ' loans . On Jan. 4 , 1928 , it was announced that they had reached a total of $4,432,970,321 . The following day there was " a violent break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributed to the large volume of loans . " But on Jan. 6 , 1928 , The Associated Press dispatches from Washington reported : " President Comm:GE is of the opin " ion that the record-breaking in " crease in brokers ' loans is not large " enough to cause unfavorable corn " ment . " So the alarm was private and personal , not official .
