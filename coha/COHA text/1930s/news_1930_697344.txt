txt An intensive drive to rid part of Manhattan of violations of the tenement house law , from stills to blocked fire escapes , to begin tomorrow and last through Saturday , was announced yesterday by William F. Deegan , Tenement House Commissioner . The commissioner said he expected to use about 250 inspectors for the drive , the regular Manhattan force being augmented by thirtynine men from Brooklyn , twenty from the Bronx and ten from Queens . The week-end phase of Mr. Deegan 's concentrated efforts to rid the city of tenement house abuses was completed yesterday when the inspectors made calls east of Fifth Avenue from Eightieth Street to 133d Street and the Harlem River . The yield over the week-end was twentyone stills , with 3,113 balconies and fire escapes inspected and many arrests made . At the end of last week the drive had been confined largely from Fourteenth Street to Chambers Street , east of Broadway . More than 100 men were used on the week-end expeditions .

" I am going to stick to this until we have accomplished our purpose 100 per cent , " Mr. Deegan said . " And we will not stop with Manhattan , either . Some day Queens is going to receive a visit from me , and on another occasion Brooklyn will find my men visiting its tenements . We are trying to do a thorough job and one that will last .

Attention had been focused on the work now under way , he said , by the shifts of department employes which he effected two weeks ago . The Bronx , Mr. Deegan said , " was in good condition , " due in no small part to the intensive efforts of his department . Manhattan , however , the commissioner considered " by far the worst of all the boroughs , " , and he attributed the condition to the fact that the tenements were so old .

He advocated " jail if necessary , " maintaining that in many cases the department had found much of its work virtually undone by offenders who , following prosecution , went right back home to repeat the old offense as if nothing had happened . Commenting on the department 's attention to stills , Mr. Deegan said that in his opinion residents of tenement houses were heeding the department 's warnings through its continued drives and raids and were disposing of their own stills . He said the inspectors were finding fewer and fewer stills . If the present drive was to accomplish real results , Mr. Deegan said , it would have to be one of " education .
