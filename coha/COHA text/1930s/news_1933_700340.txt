txt DumAS 's Guardsmen live not only in his books . The line is perpetually continued . A writer in Figaro celebrates HENRY DE CORTA , who died recently in Tonkin , a lieutenant colonel in the Foreign Legion , " magnificent , unmanageable , violent . " He sounds as though he came from the Midi . His citations for bravery , his escapes from German prisons might have been told of others . Some anecdotes of him have an individual accent . One of his men steals his commander 's revolver and shoots at another soldier . CORTA makes an inquiry . After ripe reflection he sentences the culprit to thirty days in prison " for having made use of an article belonging to his superior officer . " He adds : Extraordinary ! At this rate they will be using my razor or my shaving-brush . Put this chump who merely grazes his man at ten meters back at platoon firing again . CORTA was always indulgent to his men at the proper time . Hi let them get drunk on payday . They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't come back . " Once he was somewhere south of the Grand Atlas . His company and most of his officers were Germans . At 5 o'clock one morning he learned that at 8 the French officers , commissioned and non-commissioned , were to be killed and the ' whole force to go over to the enemy . He got the names of the fifteen ringleaders . He summoned the sergeant who had engineered the plot and told him that he had a little reconnoitring to do with a few resolute men , naming the fifteen accomplices . The sergeant did n't say a word . The squad marched out into a solitary place . CORTA orders a halt , aims his revolver at the sergeant , faces the men and says : " Eight o'clock , was n't it , when you " were going to do me ? Eight o'clock " it is . Go ahead . " The men do n't move . " I warn you , " says CORTA , " that if you miss me , I wo n't miss you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " As " things are , I 've changed my mind . " We 'll settle this business among " ourselves , as man to man . Sergeant ! " The sergeant comes forward at the order . He gets a whale of a blow in the jaw , which sends him sprawling ten meters ( sic ) away . Man by man the same vigorous treatment by the fist is given . No more trouble . The company is " cited " three times thereafter . CORTA 'S motto was that of mehitabel the cat . He was always gay , wanted everybody else to be gay , devoted to " elegance , " music and the dance . He was in Morocco , where gayety was " a matter of health . " After a sleepless festive night in which his German chauffeur had participated , the latter was told that at dawn he must start for a drive of nine straight hours : " How about sleep ? " murmured the martyr of the steering wheel . " Sleep ! " answered CORTA . " Do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chauffeur sinks down on a bed , CORTA says scornfully , " A weak constitution . " A man out of DumAs , legendary and superhuman .
