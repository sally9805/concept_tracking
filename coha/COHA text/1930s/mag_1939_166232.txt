THE PRESIDENCY Hopeful Mayor <P> A White House caller last week was San Antonio 's Mayor Maury Maverick , whom the President 's Son Elliott , now a Texas radio commentator , helped turn out of Congress last year . Mayor Maverick asked the President how the U. S. can stay out of World War II , observed that on the law of averages his own son Maury Jr. , 18 , might get killed if the U. S. became involved. * <P> Mr. Roosevelt said that he had been thinking of much the same thing : he had four sons ( James , 31 ; Elliott , 29 ; Franklin Jr. , 25 ; John , 23 ) and the law of averages would hit him harder than Maury Maverick . With a froglike grin , Mayor Maverick said that he hoped the President sent Elliott first . <P> *Maury Maverick , badly wounded in World War I , still walks with a cumbersome limp .
