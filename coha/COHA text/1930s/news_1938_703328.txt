txt It was round and it was heavy , and to Andrew Lindgren , who is inexperienced in such matters , it looked very suspicious . Andrew was startled when he stumbled over it in the yard of a plant at 1305 Belmont , where he is a watchman . " A bomb , " yelped Andrew , and he picked it up and legged it to a filling station nearby . Frank Rizzo , the operator of the station , took one look and did not bless Mr. Lindgren for bringing it . He had an idea that a gas station is no place for a bomb . Then Lieut . Anthony de Grazio was summoned . He , picked the thing up and , to the amazement of Lindgren and Rizzo , tore it apart with his bare hands , It was just the tether cover of an indoor baseball filled with sixteen ' pounds of BB 's that some amateur shot putter had thrown too far .                   @ @
