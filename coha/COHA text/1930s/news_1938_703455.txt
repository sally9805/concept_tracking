txt If the banks of the United States hope to preserve their place in the national scene they must " cease frightening potential borrowers away " and seek new lending business on terms which are suitable to the needs of business men , Jesse H. Jones , chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation , told all directors and managing officers of State and national banks in a circular letter today . Calling attention to the - failure of the banks to take a desirable share of participation in the $85,344,788 business and industrial loans made by the RFC since the end of February , the RFC chairman warned the bankers that unless they " did their part " in aiding business and the government through an effective lending policy it might . be necessary for ' they - gc ! YerKtaent. - =- to , go , further into the banking liusines. " .1 Sends Copy of New Rules - Mr. Jones attached a copy of the new uniform bank examination rules recently announced by the Controller of the Currency in cooperation with the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' securities " provide a convenient method for making time loans in bond or serial note form to business and industry , " and that they also provide " a convenient method of making loans that may be participated in by correspondent banks or the RFC . " He urged the bankers to go out and get some of the business that the finance companies have been taking away from the banks . " Banks lend to these finance companies at absurdly low interest rates instead of going after the business directly , " he said . With a strong implication - that the bankers should do for themselves . what they expect of their borrowers , the RFC chairman declared that " when the business man lets his competitor get ahead of him , the bank is quick to notice and take it into account in considering his credit rating . " Points to 17 Per Cent Profit " Twenty-five finance companies on which data is available , " he wrote , " loaned $4,360,000,000 in 1937 on an invested capital of $391 , - 000,000 ' and borrowings of $1,224 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or approximatelv 17 per cent on the capital invested . While six of our largest banks , with capital funds of a billion dollars and deposits of eight and one-half billion dollars , reported $63,000,000 profit , or 6 1-3 percent on the invested , capital . " The three largest finance companies loaned $3,620,000,000 of the total sum on an invested- capital of $266,000,000 , and reported net profits of $47,575,000 , 18 per cent on the invested capital . - " The . finance companies have proven that installment credit , efficiently handled , can be sold very profitably , while the security they require , as well as their maturities , are well within good banking practice . " Banks could render this service at much lower interest rates to the borrower and at a good profit to themselves . They would be lending deposits on which they pay little or no interest , while ' the finance companies borrow most of the money they lend . Means to Cover Zaire , Risk Cited " Many loans to businesses which do not enjoy top credit ratings may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge- to cover the extra - risk . " An , amortized loan is an installment loan. , If from one to thkee years are required to pay ? for an electric stove , a refrigerator , a washing machine or an automobile , ten years may be necessary to pay for the plants that make them . " Mr. Jones asserted that the bankers were overcautious and that this had reacted to their own financial detriment . " Many banks , " he declared , " have realized changing credit requirements and are endeavoring to meet them , but entirely too many are on the sidelines waiting . " Waiting for prospective borrowers who are often reluctant apply for loans because of fear that they will be turned down is not preserving the bank 's place in our national life . " People , regardless of their station , still have pride in their credit and business standing , regardless of the size of their business . Many bankers seem to have lost sight of this in recent years , but it is the foundation of our society . " Every- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his problems and his credit needs with his banker , and if he ' does not , it may be the bank 's fault. , Stresses RFC Lending " You bankers know that with our Hgreat abundance of banking resources it should not be necessary for the government to lend to private industry . You should- also know that the government will be forced to lend so long as there is a substantial demand for legitimate credit which is not being met . " Since the end of February when we started lending again , through July 14 , we have authorized 2,001 business and industrial loans aggregating $85,344,788 . Banks participated in only 302 of these in the aggregate amount of $11,438,444 . " This is not enough bank participation , either in number of loans or in amount . " We have 2,365 applications aggregating $81,616,893 in course of prep , aration in the agencies and in the Washington office . " I am taking this method of appealing to you as bankers to take a greater interest in these loans in the belief that you can safely make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with profit to your banks and aid  --  to your government , through making it unnecessary for the government to go further into the banking business . " I do not suggest that banks make unsound loans , but in good - business morals a ' bank should not accept the deposit account of a business , however small , unless it is willing to accord that business credit accommodations reasonably within the requirements of the business when they can be safely extended , even though it requires a little extra trouble to do so .
