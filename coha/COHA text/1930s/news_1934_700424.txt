txt Inconsiderate Dog Owners . A letter in a recent issue of your paper signed W. H. T. appealed to me strongly . It referred to the deplorable condition of our city sidewalks due to the practice of so many owners of dogs permitting them to use the sidewalks and grass plots of residences for comfort stations . I reside in a private house adjoining apartment houses ; the owners of the apartment house dogs get real upset when we remonstrate with them , and several times have been willing to resist with force any attempt to chase these animals off our property . There should be some way for the city authorities to curb these practices . The present city powers appear very willing to help such matters , and perhaps if sufficient publicity is given to the matter we may get results . J. CHARLES TOTTEN . New York , Jan. 30 , 1934.
