txt Honoring the G. A. R. To the Editor of The New York Times : As each Memorial Day passes into history the outstanding impression that remains is the very rapidly thin . ning line of the Civil War veterans. , In the very near future none of them . will pass In review on parade . A very splendid prevalent custom . in some cities exists in designating one of them as grand marshal of the Memorial Day parade . All are equally deserving of being honored in. this manner . If age or infirmities render such a one unable to actively , participate in the organization of the . parade , then this can well be left in .. the hands of a chief of staff and as- , sistants . But give the glory of lead .. ing the parade on this solemn day , to one of our aged heroes . As a member of the American Legion I would like to see the Legionaires in every city , village and . hamlet , when preparations are made for the annual Memorial Day parade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old heroes of the Civil War as long as one lives to take the post . CLARENCE S. PETERSON . Rahway , N. J. , May 31 , 1932.
