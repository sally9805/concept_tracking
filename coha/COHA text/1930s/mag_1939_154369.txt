Senatorial courtesy is the custom by which Presidential appointees " personally offensive or obnoxious " to Senators from their State are not confirmed by the Senate . Last week Virginia 's tart old Carter Glass and his junior colleague , Harry Flood Byrd , found obnoxious the appointment of Judge Floyd Roberts of the Corporation Court of Bristol to a Federal District judgeship . Reason : he had " lent himself to a conspiracy , " of which the other partners were Governor James H. Price and Franklin Roosevelt , to flout the Glass-Byrd patronage prerogative . The Judiciary Committee thumbs-downed Judge Roberts , 15-to-3 . The Senate concurred , 72-to-9 . Franklin Roosevelt promised to write Judge Roberts a right interesting letter before making another appointment . Snorted Carter Glass : " I think he 'll send up a more objectionable one-if he can find it . "
