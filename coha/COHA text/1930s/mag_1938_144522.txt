" The old Roosevelt magic has lost its kick . The diverse elements in his Falstaffian army can no longer be kept together and led by a melodious whinny and a winning smile . . . . " <P> This uncomplimentary reference to his old chief by Columnist Hugh S. Johnson was printed last week in the same papers whose front pages headlined the victory of Senator Claude Pepper in Florida 's Democratic primary-wherein , if Mr. Roosevelt 's name had lost any of its old magic , the results were not apparent . Campaigning on a platform of wholehearted allegiance to the President , Senator Pepper polled 231,000 votes to 108,000 for Representative James Mark Wilcox , an anti-Roosevelt Democrat from West Palm Beach .

" <P> Meanwhile , while Republicans and conservative Democrats were pointing out that they saw no national significance in Mr. Pepper 's smashing victory , at least one significant consequence tended to contradict them . This was that the House took immediate action to force the Administration 's Wages- &-Hours; Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Florida 's primary last week was the most clearcut test of Roosevelt strength since 1936 . Last week three other States where the issue of Rooseveltian v. Conservative Democracy was less sharply drawn held primaries for various ' offices with various results :
