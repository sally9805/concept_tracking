Life Insurance Frauds Condensed from The American Mercury Kenneth Brown Collings Mr. JONES was annoyed by his caller . " Your request is outrageous , " he said . " Merely because I applied for yoo , ooo of life insurance , I fail to see how you are privileged to pry into my personal and business affairs . I passed your regular physical examination and paid the first premium . That should be sufficient . But you sent a man into the corner store to inquire how much whisky I bought . You asked the elevator operator in my apartment house whether I entertained women in my wife 's absence . You asked my business associates as to my finances . Now you have the effrontery to demand of me a detailed statement of my affairs . By what right ? " " To prevent fraud " was the gist of the insurance investigator 's answer . Every time you buy a large life insurance policy , the same searching investigation is made into your personal career , whether or not you find it out . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of averages . Based on this law , the companies are pre- pared to gamble on your premature death . They must insist , however , that the dice are not loaded against them . Fraud is not always intentional . A chronic drunkard may state on an insurance application that he is a total abstainer , for no other reason than shame . But that wo n't prevent liquor from shortening his life . Or a man may claim that he can pay premiums far beyond his income ; and when he goes broke , the large amount of money payable to his family may become an inducement to suicide . Married men who support mistresses do not conceal that fact to defraud anyone . But when a blonde murders a policyholder , the life insurance company is out of luck . All kinds of deceptions are important , but pure , premeditated fraud figures m the majority of cases . The contest between the defenses set up by the life insurance companies and the clever schemes of the purchasers reads like fiction . Altamonte Juan Madera , a wealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life insurance in  | New York . A large part of it called for double payments in case of accidental death . Shortly thereafter , while traveling on a steamer on Lake Managua , he became violently seasick , rushed to the steamer 's rail , fell overboard , and was drowned . At least , that was the story on the death certificate . His body was not found . Claims were filed for the million dollars , plus the accidental death benefits . Affidavits of numerous witnesses accompanied them , but some of the handwriting on these proofs resembled Madera 's own writing . So the life insurance companies sent a Spanish-speaking detective to Nicaragua . He discovered that the Madera family owned the steamship line on which Juan had been riding ; so the witnesses could very easily have been hand-picked . The detective hired three American soldiers of fortune who were wise in the ways of the Central American jungle . They eventually led him to a cabin 9o miles from Managua . At midnight they burst in the door . Altamonte Juan Madera - alive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the free-lance hirelings ducked the chair and fired his pistol . Just in time the detective struck it aside and ruined the aim . All of his efforts had been concentrated on finding Madera alive . Had that bullet found its mark , the com- panies would have had to , pay $1,000,000 anyway . Mr. Hearty , an officer of a life insurance company , was enjoying a concert in a tuberculosis sanitarium . The artists were all patients , and Mr. Hearty was fascinated to discover that many of the names of the actors were also on the rolls of his company . They were collecting a monthly disability income . Here were a lot of people under one roof who had bought their life insurance in cities and towns scattered all over the United States . Practically all of them had developed consumption within a remarkably short time after passing excellent physical examinations . The companies investigated , and one patient confessed . This was the modus operandi : The patients would spend about six months in the sanitarium - long enough to heal the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns , saying nothing about where they had been . The usual stethoscoptc examination of the chest will not detect an incipient case of T.B. , nor a healed lesion . So when they arrived home , they purchased life insurance policies with disabilityincome riders attached . Of course , they denied any tubercular history . After the contestable period expired , they put in a claim for disability . Then they returned to  | the same sanitarium , sure of a comfortable income for life . Involving about 1 6o fraudulent cases , this was the most colossal life insurance fraud ever perpetrated , and represents the only type of life insurance swindle which does not depend for success upon death - real or faked . In Montana , a young man named Richards was insured for $so , ooo under a term policy . About 15 days before the expiration date , he wrote the company and demanded $600o as the price for not killing himself . He said that he was destitute ; that his wife and children were in dire need of food and clothing ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had better accept his proposition . He set a dead line for receiving the money , a few days before the end of the term . Life insurance companies will not bargain in such a way , but this one quietly sent an investigator to Richards ' home town . He found the facts as stated . Swearing each of them to secrecy , the adjuster got four of the wouldbe suicide 's best friends together , including his doctor . They agreed to watch him until his policy expired , when he would have no incentive to kill himself . The four friends took turns in the vigil , and managed to keep track of him 24 hours a day . They had a hunch that his method would be poison , so the doctor was always somewhere in the offing with a stomach pump . On the final night , when they were playing bridge , Richards went to the bathroom , and swallowed bichloride of mercury tablets . The doctor ran out to his car , returned with the pump , and immediately emptied Richards ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attempt . Mr. Waverly , a business man in a small Western town , had an  | undertaker friend named Hayes , who had charge of the disposal of the pauper dead . One day Waverly went to the city to visit Hayes , who late that night drove him home . Going over the mountains , the car stalled - this was the undertaker 's story - and Waverly got out and cranked . A few minutes later Hayes found him dead . The usual death notices were published ; Waverly was cremated . Not until this was done did Mrs. Waverly claim payment of a life insurance policy of $22,500 . An adjuster interviewed the workman who had actually burned the body . From his description , there were marked differences between the weight and height of the man he had cremated and those of Waverly . Mrs. Waverly 's mail was watched , and in time her husband was located in Nebraska . He and the undertaker both went to prison . Of course the body actually burned was one of the pauper dead . Here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with a married man who keeps a mistress . Mr. Russell of Philadelphia had $i2o , oo0 of insurance , payable to his wife . She suspected that her husband 's stenographer meant more in his life than she should . One afternoon , she threw open the door of his private office and found him and his stenographer doing things which no one should do - without locking the door . She pulled out a pistol and killed them . The $z2o , ooo insurance would have to be paid , but in cases of murder , the law will not allow a murderer to cash in on his crime . The courts must designate a new beneficiary . But in this case , a jury acquitted the lady on grounds of temporary insanity . Having been acquitted , she was no murderess , so she collected the money . All life insurance is mutual to the extent that living policy holders contribute the money which goes to the estates of the dead . I f the living are defrauded , their insurance is bound to cost them more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's crooked ness . So they investigate you be-fore they sell you insurance and again when you die . And they know all the schemes by heart . Everyone of them has been tried , over and over again .
