Like many affectionate , wilful children , three-year-old Noel Galvin was jealous of the new sister his mother brought to their Brooklyn home two months ago . One evening last week Noel found himself alone with Sister Dolores . When the mother came upon them the girl was dead . Scratches and bruises on her made police jump to the conclusion that jealous Noel had beaten her to death with his toy airplane . But the medical examiner , Dr. George W. Ruger , absolved the boy , certified that the infant 's death was due to sudden enlargement of her thymus . <P> The thymus ( sweetbread ) is a gland located above the heart , at the root of the neck . Together with the pituitary it controls growth through infancy ( 1 to 6 years ) and childhood ( 6 to 14 years ) . It normally disappears at puberty . <P> A baby with an enlarged thymus is usually fat and flabby . Because the thymus presses upon the windpipe , gullet , large blood vessels and nerves , a thymic baby when excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath , go into convulsions . Immediate remedy is an oxygen tent . X-rays of the infant 's chest will reveal any enlargement of the thymus . X-ray irradiations will reduce an enlarged thymus . The complexions of thymic children after irradiation never seem to grow old , always remain peaches &; cream .
