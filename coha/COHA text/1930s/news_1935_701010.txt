txt Food sold to consumers will be taxed but amusements and hotel and other services will be exempt under a 2 per cent sales tax bill submitted to the Legislature today by Governor Harold G. Hoffman . The bill , with two other measures also submitted , was offered as part of the Governor 's fiscal program . Food sales will not be exempted from the sales tax , it was said , because experts informed the Governor that food represented 37% per cent of all retail sales in the State . The three bills were submitted by the Governor to carry out his program for obtaining revenue estimated at $35,000,000 a year to finance emergency relief and enable municipalities to reduce levies on real estate by about one-third . The bills provide for a personal income tax , designed to yield $14 , - 500,000 ; a business franchise tax on net income to produce $2,500,000 and the sales tax , which is expected to return up to $20,000,000 . ' Statement on Reciprocity . In a memorandum on the personal income tax bill , released for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to say with regard to reciprocity between New Jersey and New York : " New York now imposes an income tax on that portion of the income of New Jersey residents earned in New York State , Under the New York State law a resident of New Jersey who pays a tax to New York State for income earned in that State would be entitled to a credit equal to the amount of the income tax he would pay this State , if New Jersey were to grant a similar credit to a New York resident , taxed on net income earned in this State . " The income tax bill as drafted contains exactly the same provision for reciprocity as does the New York act . Thus , as long as the rates and exemptions are the same in both States , no tax would be payable to New York State on incomes derived from sources within that State by residents of New Jersey and vice versa . If the proposed bill is enacted , the New Jersey resident earning his income in New York would pay income tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as rates and exemptions remain the same . If at any time the New Jersey rate should be placed lower than that in New York , the New Jersey resident earning his income in New York would have to pay to New York a tax amounting to the difference between the New Jersey and the New York rates . " While the proposed rates were derived mainly from estimates of our revenue requirements and of the incidence of any income tax that we might propose , they have been brought into line with the rates proposed for adoption in New York State by Governor Lehman , " the Governor asserted . " With both States having the same rates and the same exemptions , there is little reason to suppose that , after holding out for so long an invitation to neighboring States to impose income tax , New York State now would withdraw it . " Estimates of the amount of revenue derived by New York State from income tax imposed upon residents of this State vary widely . In normal times this revenue to New York State probably amounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to believe that at the present time the amount of such revenue averages about $2,000,000 a year . This means that New Jersey residents have been contributing this amount of money to New York State , which can and which it is now proposed be diverted to the coffers of this State without increasing the total tax paid by such residents . " Those subject to the proposed income tax would be : ( 1 ) All resident individuals receiving gross incomes of $1,000 or over if single , or $2,500 or over if married and living with husband or wife , including officers and employes of the State and its political subdivisions , except those officers whose compensation , under the Constitution , can not be changed during their terms of office . ( 2 ) Non-residents receiving gross incomes from sources within this State of $1,000 or over , with the provision that non-residents may receive credits for the amounts of any personal income tax paid by them to another State on income from sources in this State if such State grants substantially similar credits to New Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ) Certain estates and trusts . The tax would be imposed on net income , that is , upon gross income from all sources , less all ordinary and necessary expenses of doing business and certain other deductions specified in the bill . Capital gains are to be exempt from taxation and capital losses are not to be allowed as deductions . Exemptions and Rates . Personal exemptions would be : I. 51,000 to a single person or a married person not living with husband or wife . 2. 52,500 to a married individual living with husband or wife . S. $2,500 to the head of a family other than husband or wife . 4. 5400 for each dependent . The rates of the proposed tax follow : Three per cent on first $1,000 of net income above exemptions . Four per cent on second and third $1,000 of net income above exemptions . Five per cent on fourth and fifth $1,000 Of net Income above exemptions . Six per cent on sixth and seventh $1,000 Of net income above exemptions . Seven per cent on eighth and ninth $1,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all net income over $9,000 in excess of exemptions . The tax would be imposed for the period from Jan. 1 , 1935 , to Dec. 31 , 1937 . The tax , therefore , would be applied first to the income of the year 1935 . Every resident of the State required to make a return would be required to pay a filing fee of $3 . Penalties are provided for failure to pay and for delinquency . Incidence of the Impost . " The graduation of the rates is such as to impose heavier taxes on those of income groups on whom the Federal income tax falls most lightly , " Governor Hoffman said . " Capital gains and losses have been a source of considerable difficulty and an irritation to taxpayers in the administration of the Federal law and the laws of those States that recognize such gains and losses . Apart from the administrative difficulties involved in dealing with these gains and losses , it has been pretty well established that over any considerable period little or no net revenue results from recognizing them . It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are bound to arise if we tax capital gains and I permit capital losses to be deduct ' ed from income . " The bill for a business franchise tax on corporations , measured by net income , would impose a tax of 41/2 per cent on the net income ' of all domestic and foreign corporations for the privilege of doing business in this State . This proposed rate is 11/2 per cent below the rate proposed in New York State , the Governor said . Banks and insurance companies and all corporations upon which a franchise tax based upon gross receipts is now imposed by the laws of New Jersey would be exempted from the tax , as would also domestic corporations having only statutory offices in this State and not doing business within the State . Labor , agricultural and horticultural organizations . fraternal societies , domestic building and loan associations , religious , charitable , scientific and literary associations and corporations , business leagues , chambers of commerce , real estate boards and boards of trade , civic leagues , clubs not organized for profit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax is based on net income in the sense in which this term is generally understood . Every corporation , however , would be required to pay a minimum tax of $10 . The proposed Sales Tax Act imposes a tax upon all sales of tangible personal property made by retailers at the rate of 2 per cent of the total gross selling price of such sales . The tax does not apply to a ' casual sale of personal property , nor does it apply to the sales of personal property which are to be resold in the form of tangible personal property . The tax is not extended to what are commonly known as services , that is , amusements , hotels and the professional , mechanical and personal services , but , if in the sale of tangible personal property certain services are involved in the preparation of the article or are rendered to induce the purchase of the article , no deduction is allowed for the value of these services . Although the tax is imposed upon the retailer , to prevent unfair trade practices by retailers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent must be added to the sales price , To administer the imposition of the tax , all retailers are to be required to obtain a license to engage in or continue in the business of making sales which are taxable under the act . The licenses would be issued by the State Tax Commissioner for a fee of $1 . Exemptions would be as follows : Sales of commercial feeding stuffs , fertilizers , motor fuels and alcoholic beverages are exempted from the tax for the reason that all of these articles are already taxed . Sales of gas and electricity are exempted for the reason that they are presently subject to a gross receipts tax . Sales of water delivered to consumers through pipes or mains are exempted because its use is so universal . Sales of magazines which are sold for less than 11 cents and sales of all current newspapers are exempt for the reason that these items are most frequently purchased by themselves , in which case it is impossible to add to the price the fractional part of a cent which would be the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales by any governmental agency in this State to any other governmental agency in this State are exempt because in effect they are simply a transfer of property from one department of the government to another . Sales of tangible personal property which this State is prohibited from taxing under the constitution or laws of the United States are exempted . In this class are included sales made in interstate commerce .
