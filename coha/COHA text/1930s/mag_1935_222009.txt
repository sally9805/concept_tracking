Finally one driver stopped , found that his car had been dented , notified police . Few minutes later two patrolmen in a cruising car pulled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thwacked , were not disappointed .

I believe that a new hat on the White House hatrack will change the flow of events little more than a new president of Tel . &; Tel. would affect our use of the telephone . <P> " I am convinced that Frank Knox would be a good President , efficient and worthy of all trust ; but I am equally convinced that as President he would do things that are utterly abhorrent to him now , and perforce leave undone practically all of the things he now advocates .
