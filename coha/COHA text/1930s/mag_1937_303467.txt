Most anxiously awaited day in Britain 's Parliamentary year is the one on which the Chancellor of the Exchequer " opens " his Budget in the House of Commons , because ever since 1917 Britons , great and small , though ruled for the most part by Conservatives , have paid out staggering income taxes . Outstanding British taxpayers like Lord Leverhulme ( soap ) , Lord Wakefield ( oil ) , Joseph Rank ( flour &; shipping ) and Lord Nuffield ( motors ) are relieved of as much as 66% of their incomes by the Government , and it was these who faced the 1937 Budget with most fear and trembling . <P> Last week on Budget Day even those indolent M.P.s who rarely put in an appearance rolled up in full force , jam-packed the House so thickly that Laborite M.P . Richard Gibson had to take refuge in one of the galleries with a host of peers , foreign diplomats and other bigwigs , including the famed economist Sir Josiah Stamp and Bank of England 's eccentric Governor Montagu Norman . So staggering was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Montagu Norman was reported next day to have " looked bewildered as if he could not follow or believe what he heard . " <P> For the sixth time in his political career , rake-thin , hook-nosed Chancellor of the Exchequer Neville Chamberlain , slated to succeed Stanley Baldwin as Prime Minister , stepped sedately up to the red dispatch box in the centre of the floor , fished a sheaf of papers from the Chancellor of the Exchequer 's historic leather brief case , began to talk in his precise dry rasp . <P> From long practice Mr. Chamberlain knows , the advantage of cracking an early jest to distract his victims from the impending thumbscrew of his Budget revelations . Last year he said : " Perhaps I may liken this budget to the uncertain glories of an April Day . " This year if he had drawn on the calendar for his opening banter he would have had to choose the month of November , so he changed his tack , orated : " It has been suggested that I tax bachelors , bicycles , cats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . None of these things is of any use to me . " His audience tittered nervously , and shrewd Neville Chamberlain followed up with the handsome announcement that he proposed to abolish the " trousers tax " of 15 shillings a year , which every Briton who employs a manservant has hitherto had to pay . After this he got down to brass tacks and his pop-eyed listeners learned how the British Government proposes to pay for its five-year $7,500,000,000 rearmament program .
