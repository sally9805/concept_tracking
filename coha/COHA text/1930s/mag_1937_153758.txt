Non-chowchow-breeders have long considered the chowchow the most vicious of domestic dogs . They are singleminded , leonine , black-mouthed , fiery-eyed beasts , interested only in their owners and sometimes surly even to them . Last week a chowchow leaped malevolently into the news . <P> When Mrs. Eleanor Maher of Oakland , Calif , went out of her house , she left her crippled aunt , Miss Charlotte Parker , 65 , alone with her two dogs : Bootsie , a very old bulldog , and Chino , an 18-months-old thoroughbred chowchow . Presently Miss Parker grasped her cane and started to rise from her chair to go into the back yard . Suddenly Chino snapped at her hand . Then he went mad , knocked her down , started gnawing at her . Bootsie was too infirm to be of any help . But Miss Parker 's shrieks aroused the neighbors , who called the police . When a patrolman broke into the house he found Miss Parker lying unconscious in a pool of blood , Chino tearing the flesh off her arms . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him , snarling . The patrolman pinioned him beneath the chair and shot two bullets into him . Then the officer called an ambulance and Miss Parker was hurried off to a hospital . After doctors had amputated her right arm , Miss Parker regained consciousness . She was grieved that the chowchow was dead . Said she , " I love dogs . " Next morning Miss Parker , too , was dead .
