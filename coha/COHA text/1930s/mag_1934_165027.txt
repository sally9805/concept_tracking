A rare and beautiful woman was Madame la Comtesse Virginie Oldoni Verasis-Castiglione , famed courtesan of the Second Empire who divided her best years between Piedmont 's King Victor Emmanuel and France 's Napoleon III . The Countess 's costumes , her jewels and their donors provided half the talk at the Court in Paris . Artists fought to paint her . Sculptors modeled her hands , her fingers , her shapely legs , even her ears . <P> Near Versailles today is a chateau owned by a woman as rare in her way as the Countess . She is Ganna Walska and because she looks something like the famed courtesan she has made a hobby of collecting the Castiglione portraits , jewels , shawls , laces . As the Countess reincarnate Madame Walska decided to make a U. S. concert tour this winter . She arrived with 12 trunks full of costumes and after several dress rehearsals she took off last week in Philadelphia . <P> For four groups of German lieder Madame Walska had four sets of eye-filling costumes . <P> For Beethoven and Mozart : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiara transformation . <P> For Schubert : Bouffant brown taffeta , tight sequin bodice , white-plumed hat . <P> For Brahms : White satin court dress trimmed with big bunches of grapes , a necklace of diamonds the size of malagas , vine-leaves in the hair . <P> For Hugo Wolf : Madame Walska was her own sleek self in ropes of pearls and tight black velvet , cut to the waist behind . It was Ganna Walska whom Philadelphians turned out to see , regardless of her Second-Empire costumes . For them it was enough that she had overcome her stage-fright sufficiently to sing at all . <P> Twenty years ago Walska 's determination to be a singer was her principal claim to distinction . She was a poor Polish girl studying in Russia when her celebrated succession of marriages began . Baron Archadie d'Eighnhorn , a Russian officer , was Husband No. 1 . She divorced him for drunkenness in 1914 , married Dr. Julius Fraenkel , a famed New York endocrinologist who died in 1919 . Husband No. 2 sent her spirit messages , she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she met aboard boat with Harold Fowler McCormick . <P> Cochran carpets beat International Harvester that cruise . McCormick bet Cochran that he would meet Walska first . He lost . But when he got back to his Lake Shore home in Chicago it was announced that he and Mrs. Edith Rockefeller McCormick were no longer living together . Alex Cochran and Walska lived briefly together in his Murray Hill home . Then in 1920 divorce proceedings started . Madame Walska , with Dudley Field Malone for her lawyer , issued a statement that ' ' if he Cochran wants to get rid of me he must pay until it hurts for his own good . " <P> The Cochran settlement amounted to $3,000,000 and Walska went to Havana to sing . Harold McCormick heard her there , appreciated her if the Cubans did not , invited her to sing with the Chicago Grand Opera which he was then backing . Her debut was to be in Zaza but at rehearsal Conductor Giuseppe Gino Marinuzzi threw down his baton , threatened to quit the company . McCormick stood up for Walska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in the excitement Walska disappeared . Not once did she ever sing with the Chicago Opera .
