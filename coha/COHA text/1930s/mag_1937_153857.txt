Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth , enthroned in the House of Lords , sat with lowered eyes and attentive mien last week while His Majesty King George notably triumphed over his speech impediment , read off without a single mispronounced word and with few hesitations the Speech from the Throne , thus opened the first Parliament of the new reign . The 18-minute speech , composed as usual by the Cabinet , promised that His Majesty 's Government will : press on with Rearmament ; speed air raid precautions ; inaugurate penal law reforms ; regulate the coal mining , electric power , milk and whitefish industries ; combat stock frauds ; add judges to unjam the divorce courts ; publicize the health services ; expand housing ; regulate the working conditions of truck drivers and raise the efficiency of the United Kingdom 's fire brigades . <P> King George confirmed that the King of the Belgians will pay him a State visit in November , announced that King Carol of Rumania had been invited to pay him a State visit next spring . " I am looking forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time when it will be possible for me to visit my Indian Empire . ... I pray that under the blessing of Almighty God the outcome of your deliberations may advance the happiness and well-being of my people and the peace of the world . " <P> " Yellows ! " The British General Election held in the Jubilee Year of the late George V gave such a huge majority to what is now the Cabinet of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain ( bedded by gout while the King was reading his speech ) that His Majesty 's Loyal Opposition knew they could make no effective attack last week , proceeded to vituperate . <P> According to Labor speakers , the Speech from the Throne was a " cowardly " desertion of the League of Nations , and this desertion has been " progressive " in each Speech from the Throne for several years , thus : <P> 1934 King George V : " They ( the Government ) will continue to make support and extension of the authority of the League of Nations a cardinal point in their policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's foreign policy will as heretofore be based on firm support of the League of Nations . " <P> 1936 King Edward VIII : " The policy of the Government continues to be based on membership in the League of Nations . " <P> 1937 King George VI : No mention of the League of Nations last week . <P> In laboring this , their major point , Labor orators failed to show last week the zest and punch of that fine old vituperator , David Lloyd George . Once more , the fiery Welshman wagged his forefinger in the faces of members of the Cabinet , calling them " Yellows ! " " The London Committee on Spanish Non-Intervention " ( see p. 21 ) , shouted Orator Lloyd George , shaking his hoary , tousled head , " is the basest fraud ever perpetrated by great nations on a weak people ! "
