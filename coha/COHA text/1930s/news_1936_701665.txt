txt Mayor La Guardia 's plan to end the city 's agreement with its bankers was scrapped yesterday by the Democratic majority in the Board of Estimate . The Mayor had prepared a resolution which would have authorized him and Controller Frank J. Taylor to negotiate for termination of the agreement , which still has two years to run . Drawn in 1933 , the agreement covers city budgets from 1934 through 1937 . The bankers agreed to set up a revolving fund of $200,000,000 on which the city could draw to meet current expenses , with interest rates to be fixed every six months . To protect these loans the city agreed to include in each budget a tax delinquency reserve . This year the reserve was fixed at $17,000,000 , but the Mayor slashed it to $10,500,000 in his 1936 budget message . The bankers , through J. P. Morgan &; Co. , asked the Board of Estimate to fix the 1936 reserve at 317.000,000 , and it was in answer to this request that the Mayor said he would press for abolition of the agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Mayor 's plan , his resolution was introduced at yesterday 's Board of Estimate meeting . With no word of explanation , the Mayor moved that it be rei Bred to the committee of the whole , the personnel of which is identical with that of the Board of Estimate . The Mayor also moved that the bankers ' communication be referred to Corporation Counsel Paul Windels . Both motions were carried unanimously , with no discussion . The Mayor said later that the committee of the whole would meet on a day to be decided by him and Controller Taylor . After the meeting one of the Democratic members was asked why the Mayor had referred his resolution to committee , instead of pressing for an immediate vote on it . " That was his ' out , ' the member said . " He knew we were ready for him , and that he did n't have a chance to get that resolution through . So he took the easy way out by moving to refer the resolution to committee , where it will die . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon it for the next two years . That would put us in the same class as foreign nations which refuse to meet their war-debt obligations . Besides , if we did break the agreement , where would we get money to meet the city 's payrolls and other expenses . That committee of the whole room is a very fine mortuary . " Mayor Denies Plan Is Dead . The Democrats are prepared to put through a resolution shortly restoring the bankers ' reserve to $17 , - 000,000 . Two written questions were submitted to the Mayor before he left City Hall yesterday . One read : " Some members of the Board of Estimate consider the reference of the Mayor 's resolution on the bankers ' agreement to the committee of the whole as indicating that the Mayor 's plan to end the agreement is now a dead issue . If this is so , will the Mayor join other board members in restoring the reserve to $17,000,000 ? " The Mayor 's reply , relayed through Lester B. Stone of his secretarial staff , was : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board of Estimate ever said it was . I will continue to press for termination of the agreement . " To the second question , asking how the difference between the $10,500,000 and the $17,000,000 would be raised , the Mayor made no answer . The bankers were convinced after yesterday 's board meeting that the Mayor 's action was a brief flurry which would not affect their position at all . Accordingly , they prepared to resume the purchases of short-term city revenue bills under the terms of the agreement . The bankers will lend the city about $15,000,000 for the Jan. 15 payroll , another $15,000,000 for the payroll at the end of this month and about $30,000.000 for relief at an interest rate of 1 per cent within the next few days . The relief loan will be based on expected collections of the relief taxes on sales , utilities and business . Part of the loan will be repaid in the Spring and the remainder in the Summer . The low interest rate is possible because of the short term of the loan and the certainty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Too . In addition to the relief loan the bankers are prepared to bid on $25 , - 000,000 of fifty-year corporate stock to be sold on Jan. 16 . The sale is planned by Controller Taylor to refund short-term obligations the city has outstanding . All these operations were jeopardized by the Mayor 's threat to end the agreement , since the agreement states that if the city fails to abide by it the obligation of the bankers to lend money ceases . Assurances were given to the bankers yesterday that the full amount of the reserve they seek in the 1936 budget would be included by resolution of the Board of Estimate . As the board is now constituted the Democrats have a dependable majority  --  nine votes in all . Controller Taylor has three ; Timothy J. Sullivan , Aldermanic President , has three ; Borough President Samuel Levy of Manhattan has two , and Borough President James J. Lyons of the Bronx has one . Of the sixteen votes in the board the Mayor has three , Borough President Raymond V. Ingersoll of Brooklyn two and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George U. Harvey of Queens casts his single vote more often with the Democrats than with the Fusion members .
