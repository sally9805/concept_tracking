The liner St. Louis left Hamburg one Sunday last month . Out into the grey waste of the Atlantic it carried its dismal cargo : 937 German-Jewish refugees bound for Cuba . The ten-year-old , oil-burning , 16,732-ton ship was scheduled to discharge its miserable company at Havana , proceed to New York to pick up passengers for a gay June cruise to the West Indies . The refugees were to remain in Cuba until they could enter the U. S. They were a typical group of the world 's newest homeless wanderers : men in sports clothes who had paid as much as $480 for their passage ; distraught women ; doctors and lawyers who had lost their practices ; men who had been in concentration camps . There were 500 women on board . There was Max Loewe , a lawyer , with his wife and two children . There were 150 other children , 106 of them under ten . In the strange , fear-ridden , hope-ridden atmosphere of refugee ships , compounded of anxiety , relief , tension , they waited , living until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red &; black swastika ensign that flew from the stern . <P> For 13 days the ship plowed south and west . In glistening Havana Harbor on a sweltering Saturday the engines stopped . Across the water the refugees could see Morro Castle and the heat-softened outlines of Havana , where many of them had relatives among Havana 's 25,000 Jews . Ninety miles to the north lay the U. S. But the ship did not dock . The launches that approached it were ordered back by harbor police . To the refugees the stretch of water between ship and shore was as wide as the 4,600 miles the St. Louis had crossed . <P> Sunday passed and Monday . The ship lay motionless and silent in the sluggish swell . Twenty-nine passengers whose papers were in order were permitted to land . Remaining were 908 who had only provisional permits of the Cuban Immigration Department to land as passengers en route to the U. S.-and on May 5 , nine days before the St. Louis sailed , hard-faced President Federico Laredo Bru had decreed that Cuba required specific permission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rumors spread as Tuesday passed without change , as New York representatives of Jewish relief agencies flew to Havana . The rumors whispered of a longstanding dispute between the Hamburg-American Line and the Cuban Government , of a growth of Cuban anti-Semitism due to the landing of 5,000 refugees in Havana during the past year . Lawyer Loewe slashed his wrists , leaped overboard . Another passenger took poison , was saved when crew members smashed in his stateroom door .
