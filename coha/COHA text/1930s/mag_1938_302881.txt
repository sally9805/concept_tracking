During the first five years of Franklin Roosevelt 's regime , he ran the U. S. Government faster and more completely than any President before or since . In the year since the Court fight , the President may have seemed to have slackened his pace because other of the people 's representatives have bestirred themselves . But last week , of the 113,014 Federal employes in Washington , he alone made practically all the news . Renewing his contact with the electorate by radio , addressing Congress for the first time on Recession , communicating unconventionally with the House &; Senate tax committees , greeting Pan America , appointing a new Red Cross head , Franklin Roosevelt showed a brilliant dash of the old form ( see following columns ) . <P> April 14 is a sad date in U. S. history : anniversary of 1 ) the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and 2 ) the sinking of the Titanic . Auguries and omens are things which Franklin Roosevelt ignores . Last week , he began April 14 by working till 2 145 a. m. preparing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he rose , breakfasted , sent the message to the Capitol , delivered the Pan-American Day speech at the Pan-American Union Building , received six Campfire Girls and a delegation of United Automobile Workers officials , and delivered the fireside chat . <P> Unabated , the next day he told a press conference that he was planning soon to send the Capitol messages : 1 ) on removing tax-exemption features from future issues of U. S. bonds and 2 ) on antimonopoly legislation . Then , having blanketed U. S. front pages by simply making news as completely as any dictator could blanket the columns of a censored press , Franklin Roosevelt polished off his week by attending to his correspondence of some 10,000 letters , watching 30,000 children roll Easter eggs on the White House lawn .
