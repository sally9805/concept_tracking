When the Congress heard President Roosevelt 's special message on Relief last fortnight , requesting an additional $875,000,000 to operate WPA from February through June 1939 , some of the biggest spenders on Capitol Hill widened their eyes . That would be spending at the same rate as in June of last year , when WPA plunged in to meet Depression II , now superseded by Recovery . With whoops of economic righteousness , the House of Representatives last week fell upon the President 's WPA request . <P> Led by Virginia 's fleshy Clifton Alexander Woodrum , chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee in charge , the Representatives curtly dismissed an appropriation of $1,050,000,000 suggested by the Workers Alliance , of $1,000,000,000 by C. I. O. , of $915,000,000 by Mayor LaGuardia of New York City , representing the U. S. Conference of Mayors . Without even taking a record vote on the President 's figure , they lopped off $150,000,000 , set their own figure : $725,000,000 . <P> Administration whips stood idly by while coalitions of Democrats and Republicans rammed through anti-Administration provisions : <P> &gt; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> &gt; No aliens might have any . <P> &gt; Pay scales in the South must be not more than 25% lower than in the North . <P> &gt; WPA supervisors must not play politics . <P> &gt; The President 's order binding 37,000 WPA employes over into the Civil Service ( for lifetime jobs ) next month , should not take effect. + <P> In a House where the Administration is still supposed to have a majority of about 100 , this bill was passed , 397 to 16 . It was the first Relief appropriation under the New Deal which the House has reduced below White House estimates . Representatives swelled their chests with pride . <P> It was by no means certain that Franklin Roosevelt had not outsmarted the House . Correspondents had a shrewd suspicion that he had asked for more than he wanted , that , so doing , he had deliberately given the House a harmless chance to display independence and , if economy should backfire , to take the rap from constituents - all of which might make Congress more tractable later . <P> Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to begin . Chairman Adams of the Senate subcommittee in charge of the bill said that he thought the appropriation might be cut as low as $600,000,000 . A dozen Senators were eager to cram the bill with amendments against politics in relief . While they were questioning Harry Hopkins about his fitness to be Secretary of Commerce , they got him to admit that if he had to do it again , he would not have made political speeches as head of WPA ; that politics-playing WPA supervisors in Kentucky should have been " kicked out on their ears , " but were n't , " I do n't know why . " <P> He insisted that Recovery was the reason for the sharp decline in WPA rolls since November 's elections , and thereby gave them an argument against a big new WPA fund . Meanwhile , Senators studied a report by a special committee under South Carolina 's Byrnes which , if translated into law , would effectively wreck WPA as a permanent , billion-dollar political machine .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
