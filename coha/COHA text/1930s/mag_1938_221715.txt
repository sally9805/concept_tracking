In a furious , long-continued action last week , Chinese troops , holding the south bank of the Grand Canal at Hanchwang , where it intersects the railway connecting Peking with Shanghai , not only kept the Japanese from crossing and drove them back again &; again to the north bank , but finally stormed across the canal themselves . At Lini , 55 miles to the east , stubborn Chinese defenders still had not yielded the town , although pounded all week by Japanese artillery and bombers . <P> Since this blocking of the Japanese came two weeks after the Imperial Government launched their big spring offensive to take Suchow , the checkmated Japanese War Machine was so far behind schedule last week as to stand disgraced , particularly since at all times the Japanese have had command of the air . Every Chinese was fit to burst with pride . Over-optimistic Chinese newspapers predicted the Japanese will now be driven back upon Tsinan . One who knows the real situation is Mme Chiang Kaishek , " Wife of 1937 , " who is at Hong Kong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistance of China . " The strain on the Generalissimo now is gigantic , almost superhuman , " said Mme Chiang last week . " I feel that I must do everything in my power to help him hold up under that strain , because I believe his leadership is vital right now . " <P> Japanese have been striking not only down the Peking-Shanghai line but also down the Peking-Hankow railway , and last week the war was going great guns in the U-shaped area these roads make with " China 's Hindenburg Line . " This is not a closely coordinated system of defenses like the French Maginot Line , but over a period of years the Chinese have built important numbers of cement pillbox forts in a sausage-shaped area . This is traversed by the curiously named Lung-hai Railway , so called because it starts from the sea at Haichow and penetrates far inland toward Lung mountain in Kansu , forming today the sole rail link down which Soviet munitions are brought to aid China . Chinese troops held towns far on the other side of the Hindenburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week with such success that at times the Japanese lost briefly towns and villages along their main rail lines of supply &; conquest . Impudent , chuckling , the Chinese Communist Yu Cheng-tsao cracked that his bands are hunting Japanese in a " Communist State " just formed by " 7,000,000 Chinese farmers " in Hopeh . <P> In the whole Shantung-Honan-Hopeh area the Japanese last week were showing none of the decisive " punch " to which harried Chinese have become resigned at Hankow , the capital of Chiang . Spirits were high on the eve of a Kuomintang Congress scheduled for this week to adjust points of difference with the Chinese Communists . Of China and Japan able Chicago Daily Newsman A. T. Steele flashed from Hankow : " Each side believes that the other is on the brink of an internal breakdown , but each is dead wrong as far as the immediate future is concerned . ... The Government here is scarcely recognizable as the same crowd of officials who fled Nanking in confusion last fall . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
