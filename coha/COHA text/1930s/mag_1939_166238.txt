POLITICAL NOTES Moley 's Hymn <P> " Moley , Moley , Moley , Lord God Almighty " was a much-quoted squib in Washington during the first New Deal , when Professor Raymond Moley was indeed mighty in the Brain Trust . While Mr. Moley was serving Franklin Roosevelt and accumulating a reputation for vanity , he was also storing away a vast stock of personal notes , memoranda and unwritten recollections . Last week the written sum of it appeared in book form , a good 20 years before Franklin Roosevelt might normally have expected himself and his early administration to be thus exposed from within . <P> Raymond Moley 's After Seven Years* breaks all the rules . It is an unexampled chronicle of the years 1932-35 in U. S. Government ( the last four of his seven years he was on the outside looking in ) ; rich in broken confidences , intimate quotations , facts from the political bedroom . It could have come only from a bitter , frustrated , able man who once was close to the President . By letting the Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moley did not make things any better with his outraged successors in the Janizariat . They belittle it as the garrulous grousing of a " shellshocked veteran , " note the overtones of its author 's bruised ego . But they do not question its essential facts . In the Moley gallery : <P> &gt; Franklin Roosevelt is a changeable , charming , warmhearted , gullible , formidable man . " . . . When crossed he is hard , stubborn , resourceful , relentless , " Moley wrote to his sister Nell in 1932 . " . . . He seems quite naturally warm and friendly . . . because he just enjoys the pleasant and engaging role , as a charming woman does . . . . The frightening aspect ... is F. D. R. 's great receptivity . So far as I know he makes no effort to check up on anything I or anyone else has told him . I wonder what would happen if we should selfishly try to put things over on him . " <P> &gt; Moley 's nominal superior in 1933 , Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sincere , intellectually limited man , subjected to a succession of groveling humiliations . A devastating chapter is the account of the torpedoed world Monetary and Economic Conference in London 1933 . In it , Author Moley makes out Cordell Hull a simpleton let down by his Chief , the President a pitiable ignoramus " saying two plus two made ten " who did n't know beans about the international money system which he blew sky high . <P> &gt; Janizary Tom Corcoran , whom Raymond Moley introduced to palace councils , appears as a perennial sophomore . Author Moley blandly notes a private talk with Corcoran . Said Corcoran , explaining how he would get around Franklin Roosevelt 's implied promise to put the late Joe Robinson on the Supreme Court : " . . . There are n't any binding promises in politics . There is n't any binding law . You just know that the strongest side wins . " <P> Moley : " How do you choose a side , as you call it , Tom ? " <P> Corcoran : " You have a feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , begging Moley to help him draft a 1936 campaign speech for the President : " You write the music . He only sings it . " <P> &gt; Vice President Garner , warning Moley about his poor newspaper publicity : " Stop exposing yourself or you 'll get your butt spanked. "
