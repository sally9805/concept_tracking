THROUGH EMBASSY EYES-Martha Dodd - Harcourt , Brace ( $3 ) . <P> One of the queerest choices Franklin Roosevelt ever made was to pick William Edward Dodd , a history professor brimming with academic ideals , stiff-necked with homey truths and tactlessness , as U. S. Ambassador to Germany . That Martha Dodd is her father 's daughter any reader of Through Embassy Eyes will quickly see . Her account of the increasingly uneasy four and a half years the Dodds spent in Berlin is like a series of blurted indiscretions . But no one could live so long in such a focal spot in complete diplomatic immunity : some of what Martha Dodd has to tell is worth listening to , and now &; again she pokes the nodding reader in the ribs with a shrewd bit of prattle . <P> Nothing in her book quite lives up to her wide-eyed statement on p. 14 that " our family ties were abnormally close " - unless it is her name for the family 's official residence in Berlin - " The Chancery . " Before she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , very different holds on her . When she landed there in 1933 , she was practically a predigested Nazi . She liked everything she saw , discounted rumors of things unseen . <P> She became great pals with Rolf Diels , the Chief of the Secret Police , who looked like a Hollywood gangster , with " Putzi " Hanfstaengl , who swore that she was just the woman Hitler needed . ( He introduced her to the Fhrer , but nothing came of it . ) She attended the Reichstag trial , other social events that were much duller . <P> Gradually Martha Dodd got over her Nazi measles , and by the time of the Purge ( 1934 ) , she was even more violently anti-Nazi than her father . A trip to Russia , on which she never once removed her rose-colored spectacles , confirmed her in the anti-faith . She describes horrific tortures inflicted on concentration-camp prisoners ( " a few I know of directly " ) , thinks " there is still a good deal of organized opposition among the people in Germany . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing " buxomly around greeting the women guests , in his rather badly acted role of nave confusion .
