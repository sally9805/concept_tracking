LION A STORY BY WILLIAM FAULKNER A GOOD part of the lives of dogs  --  I mean hunting dogs , bear and deer dogs  --  is whiskey . That is , the men who love them , who hunt hard the hard-hunting and tireless and courageous dogs , drink hard too . I know certainly that the best , the finest talk about dogs which I have heard took place over a bottle or two or three bottles maybe , in the libraries of town houses and the offices of plantation houses or , better still , in the camps themselves ; before the burning logs on hearths when there were houses , or before the high blazing of nigger-fed wood before stretched and earth-pegged tarpaulins when there were not . So this story might just as well begin with whiskey too . It was December ; it was the coldest December I ever saw . We  --  I was just sixteen that year  --  had been in camp a week now and the men had run out of whiskey , and so Boon Hogganbeck and I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major de Spain to get some more . That is , Major de Spain sent Boon in to get the whiskey , and he sent me along to get Boon back to camp with the whiskey in the suitcase and not in Boon . Boon was part Indian . They said half , but I do n't think so . I think it was his grandmother who was the Chickasaw woman , niece of the chief who once owned the land which Major de Spain now owned and over which we hunted . Boon was four inches over six feet , and he had the mind of a child and the heart of a horse and the ugliest face I ever saw . It looked as if somebody had found a walnut a little smaller than a basket ball and with a machinist 's hammer had shaped the features of the face and then painted it , mostly red . Not Indian red : a fine bright ruddy color that whiskey might have had something to do with but probably mostly just happy and violent out-of-door life . The wrinkles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have come just from squinting into the sun or into the gloom of cane brakes where game had run , or have been baked into his face by camp fires while he tried to sleep on the cold November or December ground while waiting for daylight so he could get up and hunt again  --  as though time were just something he walked through as he did in air , to age him no more than air did . The eyes were like shoebuttons , without depth , without meanness or generosity or viciousness or gentleness or anything at all : just something to see with . He did n't have any profession or trade or even job : he just did whatever Major de Spain told him to do . Later , after Lion died , Major de Spain had him appointed marshal of Hoke 's , the little town on the edge of Major de Spain 's preserve . But that had not happened yet ; Lion was not dead yet . We got up at three o'clock this morn-ing . Ad had breakfast ready and we ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the smell of the frying ham or maybe by Ad 's feet on the floor overhead ; we could hear Lion then , just once , short and peremptory , as the best hunter in any crowd has only to speak once to all the others except the ones that are fools , and there were no fools among Major de Spain 's dogs . As he said , sometimes he had fools in the house because now and then he could not help himself . But that did not matter so much because he did not intend to hunt with them or depend on them to hunt . Ad had the mules in the wagon , waiting too , and it was cold , the ground frozen and the stars hard and bright . I was not shivering , I was just shaking slow and steady and hard , the breakfast I had just eaten warm and comfortable inside me and my stomach still warm from it and the outside of me shaking slow and hard as if my stomach were floating loose inside me like the globe of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , anyway , " I said . " No dog will have any nose to-day . " " Cep ' Lion , " Ad said . " He run a bear the a thousand-acre ice house . Ketch him too . Other dogs do n't matter because they do n't keep up wid Lion nohow . " " Well , they ai n't going to run this morning , " Boon said , harsh and positive . " Major promised they would n't run till me and Quentin get back . " He was sitting on the jolting seat , his feet wrapped in towsacks and a quilt from his pallet in the kitchen wrapped around him and over his head so that he did n't look like anything at all . Ad laughed . " I like to know why Major need to wait on you . Hit 's Lion he gonter use ; I ai n't never heard tell of you bringing no bear nor any yuther kind of meat into this camp . " " By God , he ai n't going to put Lion or no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boon said . " Because he promised me . Whup up them mules ; you want me to freeze to death ? " He and Ad were funny . It was Lion that made the difference , because Boon had a bad name among negroes . Yet Ad talked to him , when Lion was a factor ( even though he was not mentioned ) , just as if Ad were another white man ; and Boon Jet him do it . They were funny about Lion . Neither one of them owned him or had any hope of ever owning him and I do n't believe it ever occurred to either of them to think , I wish I owned that dog . Because you did n't think of Lion as belonging to anyone , any more than you thought about a man belonging to anybody , not even to Major de Spain . You thought of the house and the woods as belonging to him and even the deer and the bear in them ; even the deer and bear killed by other people were shot by them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his kindness and will . But not Lion . Lion was like the chiefs of Aztec and Polynesian tribes who were looked upon as being not men but both more and less than men . Because we were not men either while we were in camp : we were hunters , and Lion the best hunter of us all , and Major de Spain and Uncle Ike McCaslin next ; and Lion did not talk as we talked , not because he could not but because he was the chief , the Sunbegotten , who knew the language which we spoke but was superior to using it himself ; just as he lived under the house , under the kitchen , not because he was a dog , an animal , but for the same reason as the Aztec or the Polynesian whose godhead required that he live apart . Lion did not belong to Major de Spain at all but just happened to like him better than he did any of the rest of us , as a man might have . Ad and Boon were funny about him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a beautiful woman . I used to listen to them ; they would wait until Major de Spain had settled down to the poker game or maybe was in bed , if we were going out early , and then Boon and Ad would each try to get Lion in to sleep on his pallet with him , Ad in the kitchen and Boon in the shed room . It would he funny . They would be so deadly serious about it , not arguing with each other but each one trying to work on Lion , persuade or tempt him ; and he not caring which one he slept with , and not staying long with either one even when they persuaded him , because always Major de Spain would carry the lamp into Boon 's shed or into the kitchen , as the case might be , and make them put Lion outdoors . " Damn it , " he would say , " if he slept with either one of you for half the night he would n't even be able to trace a polecat tomorrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wagon jolting in the iron ruts , the woods impenetrable and black on either hand . Once we heard two wildcats squalling and fighting off to the right and not far away . We came to the dummy line and Boon flagged the early log train and we rode into Hoke 's in the warm caboose , while I slept behind the red stove and Boon and the conductor and brakeman talked about Lion and Old Ben as people talked about Sullivan and Kilrain or Dempsey and Tenney . Old Ben was a bear and we were going to run him to-morrow as we did once every year , every time in camp . He was known through the country as well as Lion was . I do n't know why they called him Old Ben nor who named him except that it was a long time ago . He was known well for the shoats he had stolen and the corn cribs he had broken into and the dogs he had killed and the number of times he had been bayed and thelead which he carried ( it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen times , with buckshot and even with rifles ) . Old Ben had bast three toes from his nigh hind foot in a steel trap , and every man in the country knew his track , even discounting the size , and so he should have been called Two-Toe . That is , that 's what they had been calling two-toed bears in this country for a hundred years . Maybe it was because Old Ben was an extra bear  --  the head bear , Uncle Ike McCaslin called him  --  and everyone knew that he deserved a better name . We were in Hoke 's by sun-up , Boon and me , getting out of the warm caboose in our hunting clothes , our muddy boots , and stained khaki . Boon had n't shaved since we came into camp , but that was all right because Hoke 's was just a sawmill and a few stores , and most of the men in it wore muddy boots and khaki too . Then the accommodation came ; Boon bought three packages of molasses-covered popcorn and a bottle of soda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sound of his chewing . But in Memphis we did not look all right . The tall buildings and the hard pavements and the street cars made our boots and khaki look a little rougher and muddier and made Boon 's whiskers look worse and his face more and more as if he should never have brought it out of the woods at all or at least out of reach of Major de Spain or somebody who knew it and could say , " Do n't be afraid . He 's all right ; he wo n't hurt you " ? Boon walking through the station , on the tile floor , his face moving where he was still working the popcorn out of his teeth with his tongue , his legs spraddled a little and a little stiff in the hips as if he were walking on buttered glass , and that blue stubble on his face and chin Iike used steel wool or like ravelings from screen wire . We went straight and had the suitcase filled and Boon bought a bottle for himself , to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time we reached Hoke 's again at sundown , it was all gone . He drank the first time in the washroom at the station . A man in uniform came in to tell Boon he could n't drink there and took one look at Boon 's face and did n't say anything . The next time he drank from his water glass , filling it under the edge of the counter where we were eating dinner and the waitress did tell him he could not . In the meantime he had been telling the waitress and all the other customers about Lion and Old Ben . Then he got on to the subject of the zoo some way , and his plan was to hurry back to camp , get Lion and return to the zoo where , he said , the bears were fed lady fingers and ice cream and where we would match Lion against them all , tigers and elephants included . But I got him and the suitcase aboard the train , so we were all right then , with Boon drinking right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Ben ; the men he buttonholed no more dared to act as if they did not want to listen than the man in the washroom had dared to tell Boon he could n't drink there . We were back in Hoke 's at sundown and I waked him and got him and the suitcase off and persuaded him to eat supper . When we got on the caboose of the evening Iog train which went back into the woods , the sun was going down red and it already seemed warmer . I was the one who went to sleep again now , sitting behind the stove again while Boon and the brakeman and the conductor talked about Lion and Old Ben and the drive to-morrow ; they knew what Boon was talking about . Once I waked ; it was dark now and the brakeman was leaning out the window . " It 's overcast , " he said . " It will thaw to-night and to-morrow scent will lie to a dog 's nose . Maybe Lion will get him to-morrow . " It would have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He never could shoot . He never had killed anything bigger than a squirrel that anybody knew uf , except that nigger that time . That was several years ago . They said he was a bad nigger , but I do n't know . All I know is , there was some trouble and the nigger told Boon he 'd better have a pistol next time he came to town and Boon borrowed a pistol from Major de Spain and sure enough that afternoon he met the nigger and the nigger outs with a dollar-and-a-half mail order pistol and he would have burned Boon up with it only it never went off . It just snapped five times and the nigger kept coming , and Boon shot four times and broke a plate-glass window and shot in the leg a nigger woman who happened to be passing before he managed to hit the nigger in the face at six feet with the last shot . He never could shoot . The first day in camp , the first drive we made , the buck ran right over him ; we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploded shells were not fifty feet apart . We heard Boon 's old pump gun go whow whow whow whow whow and then we heard him ; they could have heard him clean up to Hoke 's : " God damn , here he comes ! Head himl Head him ! " The next morning we had company , people from Hoke 's and from Jefferson too , who came every year for the day when Major de Spain drove Old Ben . It was gray and warmer ; we ate breakfast by lamplight , with Boon frying the eggs and still talking , looking wilder and more unpredictable and more uncurried in the face than ever , and Ad sitting on his box beside the stove , pushing the heavy solid greasy cartridges into Major de Spain 's carbine . And we could hear the dogs too now , in the yard where Ad had already coupled them in pairs and tied them to the fence  --  the snarling bursts of almost hysterical uproar ; we could hear them all except Lion . There was no sound from him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out and into the damp , gray , faint light and there he stood , apart from the other dogs and not tied , just standing there and looking huge as a calf looks , or an elephant or buffalo calf , huge despite its actual size . He was part Walker , but most of him was mastiff ; he was the color of a blue sorrel horse , though perhaps it was his topaz-colored eyes that made him look so dark . I remember how he stood there  --  big-footed , with his strong grave head and a chest almost as big as mine . Beneath the skin you could feel the long , easy , quiet , strong muscles that did not flinch with either pleasure or distaste from any touch , Major de Spain 's or Boon 's or Ad 's or any stranger 's . He stood like a horse , only different from a horse because a horse promises only speed while Lion promised  --  with that serene and comforting quality of a promise from a man whom you trust absolutely  --  an immeasurable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue and kill , but for endurance , the will to endure beyond any imaginable limit to which his flesh and heart might be called . I remember hint in the summer when we would go in for squirrels , how when the other dogs would be all over the bottom , chasing coon and wildcat and anything that ran and left scent , Lion would not go . He would stay in camp with us , not especially following Major de Spain or Boon or Ad in particular ; just lying nearby somewhere in the attitude in which they carve lions in stone , with his big head raised and his big feet quiet before him ; you would go to himand speak to him or pat him and he would turn his head slowly and look at you with those topaz eyes that were as impenetrable as Boon 's , as free of meanness or generosity or gentleness or viciousness but a good deal more intelligent . Then he would blink and then you would realize that he was not looking at you at all , not seeing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing , what he was thinking . It was like when you are sitting with your feet propped against a column on the gallery and after a while you are not even aware that you arc not seeing the very column your feet are propped against . The two mules were ready too , one for Major de Spain , who was going with Bonn and Ad and the dogs ; and the other for Uncle Ike McCaslin , who was going to put us on the stands . Because he and Major de Spain knew Old Ben as well as they knew each other . They knew where he denned and where he used and which direction he took when dogs jumped him . That was why we had been in camp a week and had n't run him yet ; that was the way Major de Spain did . Each year he ran Old Ben just one time , unless Old Ben happened to let himself be caught out of bounds on a visit or something and the dogs started him by accident , which did happen the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry it down toward the river ; Lion was not with them . They went out of hearing and after a while Boon came up , cussing . But hunting was over for that day and so we went back to camp . We had not heard them again , but when we reached camp the dogs were already there , crouched back under the kitchen , huddled together as far back as they could go and Boon squatting down and peering under the kitchen at them and cussing , and Uncle Ike said it was Old Ben they had struck . Because they knew Old Ben too and the ones that did n't know him probably found out pretty quick . They were not cowards . It was just that Lion had n't been with them to lead them in on him and bay him and hold him . Lion was with Major de Spain ; they came in about an hour later with Lion on the leash and Major de Spain said it was Old Ben , that he had seen the track , still having to hold Lion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day . I remember him sitting on the mule in the gray light with his rifle across the saddle , and Boon with his old gun slung over his shoulder by a piece of cotton rope and still cussing while he and Ad struggled to hold the dogs while they untied them , and only Lion and Major de Spain calm and Major de Spain looking around at us and saying , " No deer this morning , boys . This is Old Ben 's race . " He meant there must be no shooting , no noise that might turn Old Ben because he wanted everybody to have a fair chance . Uncle Ike explained that to me when he put me on my stand , after we watched Major de Spain ride away , with Lion heeled and pacing along beside the mule and Ad and Boon in front , stooped over and half running in a surging uproar of dogs as if they were running in surf . " Stay here until you kill a bear or hear a horn , or until you have n't heard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If Lion bays him , me or Major or Boon will blow everybody in . If you do n't hear anything after a while , go back to camp . If you get lost , stand right still and holler and listen . Some of the boys will hear you . " " I 've got my compass , " I said . " All right . Stay right still now . He may cross the bayou right here ; I have known him to do it . Do n't move around . If he comes over you , give him time to get close . Thcn holdright on his neck . " Then he rode away , into the gray gloom . It was full daylight now ; that is , it was full daylight up above the trees , because it would never be very light down here that day . I had never been in this part of the bottom before , because Major de Spain had not let us hunt here lest we disturb Old Ben before the right day . I stood there under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still water ran out of the cane and across a little clearing and into the cane again . I had been on stand before where you might see a bear and I had seen bear signs . But this was different ; I was just sixteen then ; I kept on thinking about those dogs huddled back there under the kitchen that day and I could smell the solitude , the loneliness , something breathing out of this place which human beings had merely passed through without altering it , where no axe or plow had left a scar , which looked exactly as it had when the first Indian crept into it and looked around , arrow poised and ready . I thought about how just twenty miles away was Jefferson , the houses where people were getting ready to wake up in comfort and security , the stores and offices where during the day they would meet to buy and sell and talk , and I could hardly believe it ; I thought It 's just twenty miles away . What 's the matter with you ? but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me would say , Yes , and you are just a puny assortment of bones and meat that can not get one mile from where you stand without that compass to help you and could not spend one night where you are and live without fire to keep you warm and perhaps that gun to protect yourself . I had forgotten that I had a gun . I had completely forgotten it . I was telling myself that black bears are not dangerous , they wo n't hurt a man unless they are cornered , when all of a LION 73 sudden I thought , with a kind of amazed surprise , Besides , I have a gun . Why , 1 have a gun ! I had clean forgotten it . I had n't even loaded it ; I broke it quickly , fumbling in my coat for shells . I was not scared any more now ; I was just suffering one of those mindless and superstitious illusions which people get  --  I do anyway . I believed that by getting scared and failing to load my gun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben through . I had conferred supernatural powers on him now . I had a picture of him lurking back in the cane , watching his chance and waiting for one of us who barred his way to make a mistake , and I had made it ; I believed , knew , that he would charge out of the cane and pass me before I could get loaded . I thought I should never pick up the two shells , and then I had a terrible impulse to read the size of the shot printed on the wadding to be sure , even though I knew I had only buckshot . But I did n't ; I got the gun loaded and snapped it shut , already swinging toward the spot of cane where I had hypnotized myself to believe he would emerge . I think that if a bird had moved in it I should have fired . But 1 never saw him . I just heard the dogs . Suddenly I knew that I had been hearing them for a second or two before I realized what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I heard Lion , just once . His voice was not deep especially , it was just strong and full ; he bayed just once somewhere in the gray light maybe a mile away , and that was all , as if he had said , " All right , Old Man . Let 's go . " It was the other dogs making the racket . But I never saw any of them . At the closest time they were a half mile away and they did n't pass near any stand because I heard no shots . I just stood there , crouched , holding my breath , with the safety off even though father had taught me never totake it off until I saw what I was going to shoot at ; and I heard the dogs pass me and go on . Then the sound died away . I did n't move ; I waited . I was thinking , maybe he will turn and come back . But I knew that he would not . He must have known where all of us were standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have got through unseen . Because he had lived too long now , been run too many times . I stood there , still holding my gun forward , though I did slip the safety back on . I do n't know how long it was ; then I whirled . But it was only father . " You did n't see him ? " father said . " No , sir . But it was Old Ben , was n't it ? " " Yes . So Uncle Ike says . He 's gone across the river . He wo n't come back to-day . So we might as well go back to camp . " We went back to camp . Major de Spain was already there , sitting on the mule with Boon 's gun in the rope sling over his shoulder now ( he told how Boon had stopped just long enough to throw the gun at him and say , " Here , take the damn thing . I ca n't hit him with it nohow " ) . They had the other team in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat into the wagon when we came up , and Major de Spain told us how Old Ben and the dogs had crossed the river , and that Ad and Boon had swum it too , and that Uncle Ike was waiting at the river while he came back for the boat . " He killed Kate this side of the river without even stopping , " Major de Spain said . " Come on , boys . Lion was n't five hundred yards behind him . He will bay him soon and then we will get him . " So we all went back to the river . But the boat was just a duck boat , so it would n't hold any more than Major de Spain and Uncle Ike . Theophilus McCaslin , Uncle Ike 's grandson , said he knew about a log drift across the 74 HARPERS MONTHLY MAGAZINE river about three miles down , so he and some of the others went to look for it . I wanted to go too , but father said I 'd better come on back to camp so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mules and the wagon and the dead dog . It began to rain before we got back ; it rained slowly and steadily all afternoon , and we ate dinner and then Theophilus and the others came in and said they had got across the river but they could n't hear anything and so they came back . The men played cards some but not much because every now and then somebody would go to the window and look out across the field to where the woods began , the black trees standing in the rain like a picture in ink beginning to dissolve . " He must have carried them clean out of the country , " somebody said . It was still raining at dark . But we did n't eat supper yet ; we waited , and now there was somebody watching the woods all the time , and just before dark Theophilus McCaslin began to blow a horn every five minutes to guide them in . Yet when they did come , nobody saw them at all ; we were all inside at the fire ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then in the hall ; we were still sitting down when Boon walked into the room . He was carrying something big wrapped in his hunting coat , but we did n't even look to see what it was because we were looking at Boon . He was wet and muddy and there was blood all over him , streaked by the rain . But that was n't it . It was his face , his head . There was a bloody furrow ( you could see the five claw-marks ) wide as my hand starting up in his hair and running down the side of his head and right on down his arm to the wrist ; there was a bloody blob hanging on the side of his head that I did n't know until the next day was his left ear , and his right breeches ' leg had been ripped off and the leg under it looking likeraw beef and the blood from it staining his boot darker than the rain . But that was n't it either . Because then we saw that what he was carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , looking at us , and he began to cry . I never bad seen a man cry before . He stood there in the lamplight , looking big as all outdoors and bloody as a hog , with that tough unshaven face of his crinkled up and more like a dried walnut than ever , and the teats streaming down it fast as rain . " Good God , Boon ! " father said . We got up then ; we all kind of surged toward him and somebody tried to touch the coat ; I had n't even seen Major de Spain standing behind him until then . " Get to hell away ! " Boon hollered to the one who touched the coat . " His guts are all out of him . " Then he hollered , " Saddle me a mule ! Hurry ! " and turned , with all of us following now , and crossed the hall into the shed where he slept and laid Lion on his pallet . " Damn it to hell , get me a mule ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes ! " Boon hollered . " I 'm going to Hoke 's and get a doctor ! " " No , you 're not , " Major de Spain said . " You need a doctor yourself . One of the other boys will go . " " The hell I ai n't ! " Boon hollered . He looked wild , bloody and wild as he glared round at us , then he ran out , the torn bloody clothes flapping behind him , still hollering , " Help me catch a mule ! " " Go and help them , " father said , pushing me toward the door . There were three of us . We were almost too late to help any ; we had to run to keep up with him . Maybe he was still crying , or maybe he was in too much of a hurry to cry now . We kept on trying to find out what happened but Boon could n't even seem to hear the questions ; he was talking to himself , saddling the mule fast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , make him stay out , " lie said . " I tried to . And them others would n't help him , would n't go in . " And he did try . Ad said ( Ad was there ; he saw it all ) that when Boon ran in , Lion was already on the ground and that Boon caught him by the hind leg and flung him twenty feet away , but that Lion hit the ground already running and that he beat Boon back to Old Ben . Then Boon got into the saddle without even touching the stirrups and was gone ; we could hear the mule already loping . Then we went back to the house , where Major de Spain was sitting on the pallet with Lion 's head in his Iap , soaking a rag in a pan of water and squeezing it into Lion 's mouth . Lion was still wrapped in the coat and under a blanket , to keep the air away from his entrails . But I do n't think he was suffering now . He just lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his eyes open a little and looking yellower than ever in the lamplight ; once I saw his tongue come out and touch Major de Spain 's hand . Then about midnight ( Major de Spain had sent the wagon back to the river before he followed Boon into the house ) Uncle Ike and Ad came in with Old Ben ; and Ad stood in the door too , as Boon had done , with the tears running down his face too , and Uncle Ike told about it , what Ad had told him : about how Lion had bayed Old Ben against a down tree top and the other dogs would not go in , and how Old Ben caught Lion and had him on the ground , and Boon ran in with the hunting knife and jerked Lion back , but he would not stay out ; and how this time Boon jumped straddle of Old Ben 's back and got the knife into him , under the shoulder ; Ad said that Boon picked Old Ben clean up from behind , his arm round Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head and arm while Boon worked the knife blade round until he touched the life . Boon got back just before daylight with the doctor , and the doctor told about that too : how Boon busted past the doctor 's wife when she opened the door and how the first thing the doctor knew was when Boon waked him up dragging him out of the bed like a sack of meal . He thought Boon was crazy , especially when he saw him , the blood and all . Boon would n't even wait long enough to have himself attended to ; he did n't even want to wait long enough for the doctor to put on his clothes . He would n't let the doctor do anything for him now until he had fixed Lion ; he just stood there in his blood and his torn clothes and with his wild face , saying , " Save him , Doe . By God , you had better save him ! " They could n't give Lion chloroform ; they did n't dare . They had to put his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still do n't think he felt it , suffered . He just lay there on Boon 's pallet , with his eyes half open and Major de Spain holding his head , until the doctor was through . And not even Boon said , " Will he live ? " We just sat there and talked quietly until the light came and we went out to look at OM Ben with his eyes open too and his lips snarled back and the neat slit just in front of the shoulder where Boon had finally found his life , and the mutilated hind foot and the little hard lumps under his skin which were the old bullets , the old victories . Then Ad said breakfast was ready . We ate , and I remember how that was the first time we could not hear any dogs under the kitchen , though I asked Ad and he said that they were there . It was as though Old Ben , even dead and harmless out there in the yard , was a more potent force than they were alive without Lion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rain had stopped before midnight and about noon a thin sun came out and we moved Lion out onto the porch , in the sun . It was Boon 's idea . " Damn it , " he said , " he never did like to stay in the house . You know that . At least let 's take him out where he can see the woods . " So Boon loosened the floor boards under the pallet so that we could pick up the pallet without changing Lion 's position , and we carried him out to the porch and we sat there now . The people at Hoke 's had heard that we had got Old Ben and about Lion ; there must have been a hundred men came in during the afternoon to look at Old Ben and then come and look at Lion , to sit and talk quietly about Lion , the races he had made and the bears he had brought to bay , and now and then Lion would open his eyes ( Boon had laid him so he could look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to what they were saying but as if he was looking at the woods for a moment before closing his eyes again , remembering the woods again or seeing that they were still there . Maybe he was , because he waited until dark before he died . We broke camp that night ; we went out in the wagon , in the dark . Boon was quite drunk by then . He was singing , loud . This is how Lion 's death affected the two people who loved him most  --  if you could have called Boon 's feeling for him , for anything , love . And I suppose you could , since they say you always love that which causes you suffering . Or maybe Boon did not consider being clawed by a bear suffering . Major de Spain never went back again . But we did ; he made us welcome to go ; it seemed to please him when we went . Father and the others who had been there that time would talk about it , about how maybe if they could just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would not ; he wasalmost sharp when he refused . I remember the day in the next summer when I went to his office to ask permission to go in and hunt squirrels . " Help yourself , " he said . " Ad will be glad to have some company . Do you want to take anybody with you ? " " No , sir , " I said . " I thought if maybe Boon . . . " " Yes , " he said . " I 'll wire him to meet you there . " Boon was the marshal at Hoke 's nuw ; Major de Spain called his secretary and sent Boon the wire right away . We did n't need to wait for an answer ; Boon would be there ; he had been doing what Major de Spain told him to for twenty years now at least . So I thanked him and then I stood there and after a minute I got up my nerve and said it : " Maybe if you would come . . . " But he stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he did n't say anything at once . He just seemed to turn to his desk and the papers on it without moving ; and I stood there looking down at a little plumpish gray-headed man in expensive , unobtrusive clothes and an old-fashioned immaculate boiled shirt , whom I was used to seeing in muddy khaki , unshaven , sitting the mule with the carbine across the saddle , and Lion standing beside him as a thoroughbred horse stands and motionless as a statue , with his strong grave head and his fine chest ; the two of them somehow queerly alike , as two people get who have been closely associated for many years in doing something which both of them love and respect . He did n't look at me again . " No . I will be too busy . But if you have luck , you might bring me a few squirrels when you come back . " " Yes , sir , " I said . " I will . " So I reached Hoke 's early and caught the morning log train into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the same , yet different , because they were summer woods now , in full leaf , not like that iron dawn when Boon and I had flagged the train to go in to Memphis . And it was hot too . Ad was there with the wagon to meet me ; we shook hands . " Mr. Boon here yet ? " I said . " Yes , suh . He got in last night . He in de woods fo daylight . Gone up to de Gum Tree . " I knew where that was . It was a single big gum just outside the woods , in an old clearing . It you crept up to it quietly just after daylight this time of year , sometimes you would catch a dozen squirrels in it , trapped there because they could not jump to another tree and dared not descend . So I told Ad to take my duffel on to the house ; I would hunt up through the woods and meet Boon . I did n't say I was going by the holly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the point where he put me down was on a direct line with the knoll and the Gum Tree . " Watch out for snakes , " he said . " Dey 's crawling now . " " I will , " I said . He went on and I entered the woods . They were changed , different . Of course it was just the summer ; next fall they would be again as I remembered them . Then I knew that that was wrong ; that they would never again be as I remembered them , as any of us remembered them , and I , a boy , who had owned no Lion , knew now why Major de Spain knew that he would never return and was too wise to try to . I went on . Soon the earth began to lift under my feet and then I saw the hollies , the four pale trunks marking the four corners and inside them the wooden cross with Old Ben 's dried mutilated paw nailed to it . There was no trace of grave any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that was all right because it was not Lion who was there ; not Lion . Maybe it was nice for him now , nice for him and Old Ben both now  --  the long challenge and the long chase , the one with no heart to be driven and outraged , the other with no flesh to be mauled and bled . It was hot and the mosquitoes were too bad to stand still in , besides it was too late to hunt any more this morning ; I would go on and pick up Boon and go back to camp . I knew these woods and presently I knew that I could not be very far from the Gum Tree . Then I began to hear a curious sound . It sounded like a blacksmith shop  --  someone hammering fast on metal . It grew louder as I approached . Then I saw the clearing , the sun ; the hammering , the furious hammering on metal , was quite loud now , and the trees broke and I saw the Gum Tree and then I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not changed ; the same Boon who had almost missed that nigger and had missed that buck ; who could not shoot even when his old worn-out gun held together . He was sitting under the tree , hammering at something in his lap , and then I saw that the tree was apparently alive with frightened squirrels . I watched them rush from limb to limb , trying to escape , and rush , dart , down the trunk and then turn and dart back up again . Then I saw what Boon was hammering at . It was a section of his gun ; drawing nearer , I saw the rest of it scattered in a dozen pieces about him on the ground where he sat , hunched over , hammering furiously at the part on his lap , his walnut face wild and urgent and streaming with sweat . He was living , as always , in the moment ; nothing on earth  --  not Lion , not anything in the past  --  mattered to him except his helpless fury with his broken gun . He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who I was ; he just shouted at me in a hoarse desperate voice . " Get out of here " he said . " Do n't touch them ! They 're mine ! "
