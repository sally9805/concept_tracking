By the end of the 19th Century , after countless years of elaboration , the craft of the carriage maker had attained near-perfection . Then the automobile appeared on the vehicular horizon . In the early years of automobile manufacture the traditions of the ancient carriage craft were continued . The first automobile engine was mounted on a buggy chassis . The new vehicle was popularly associated with its predecessor and nicknamed the " horseless carriage " and " gasoline buggy . " Ex-carriage makers became automobile body designers . Early cars were frequently entered from the rear ( dog cart ) , equipped with horsewhip stands , often painted black and usually festooned with fringe , beautified with brass . <P> In the 40 years of its existence the automobile has had few revolutionary changes in appearance . The airplane put such terms as " wind-resistance " and " streamline " into auto manufacturers ' mouths . The speed boat 's influence may be observed in the stern of many modern racy roadsters . But most limousine designers still seem to think that their job is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landau and victoria . <P> Last week the 30th annual National Automobile Show ( see p. 43 ) was held in Manhattan 's gaudy Grand Central Palace where gleaming cars stood incongruously on rich carpets and glib salesmen explained their various attractions . Obviously the recent U. S. renascence in bathroom fixtures and furniture has smitten the automobile . Some of the artists responsible for the renascence are now working on auto bodies : Norman Bel Geddes , jack-of-all-design ; Joseph Urban , Ziegfeld and Metropolitan Opera scenic artist ; Helen Dryden , painter and fashion artist ; the house of Cartier , jewelers . <P> Most startling 1930 innovations are the Cord and Ruxton front drive cars which stand barely five feet high . Some models of the Willys-Knight are painted partly to resemble Scotch plaid ; radiator caps are lower , some being merely dummies . One dummy cap is fashioned like a gunsight , perhaps to perfect the driver 's aim . Some cars ( Franklin , Packard , Graham ) have abandoned ventilating slits in the hood and substituted small doors . The Pierce-Arrow , tenaciously traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment has been altered and refined . Flower vases are now in the Greek manner ; many-hued rayon-silk covers the seats ; Egyptian sculpture motives have been adapted for dashboard instruments ; vivid soda-fountain marble is used for gear shift handles . With the introduction of non-dulling , non-rusting chrome-nickels , there are more cars with shiny , metallic surfaces than ever before . The hood is sometimes of different texture from the rest of the body . <P> Altogether the trend seems to be toward ultra-refinement . The auto-body is safely out of the buggy chrysalis . Enterprising designers begin to regard it as an entity , having its own particular problem and solution , its own utilitarian beauty .
