For 20 years Manhattan 's most persistent exhibition-goer was a little old gentleman with a beard , a beady eye and baggy trousers . Standing before a painting , preferably a high-priced one , he would mutter . " Pffft ! Such crude pigments ! My , such a stencil technique-brr-let me get away ! " He stopped other gallery-goers to tell them he was the world 's greatest artist , passed out handbills describing himself as " Mesmerist-Prophet and Mystic , Humorist Galore , Ex All Round Athletic Sportsman ( to 1889 ) , Scientist supreme : all ologies , Ex Fancy amateur Dancer . . . . " He wrote crank letters to the newspapers . His letterhead : " Mahatma Dr. Louis M. Eilshemius , M.A. etc. , Mightiest Mind and Wonder of the Worlds , Supreme Parnassian and Grand Transcendant Eagle of Art . " His paintings , on the rare occasions he could get them shown , brought horse laughs from critics and public alike . <P> Last week Louis Eilshemius was again hailed as " the greatest living master " - this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 57th Street galleries- Kleemann , Boyer , Valentine , he was being given simultaneous one-man shows . Another Eilshemius exhibition was touring the Pacific Coast ; a fifth was about to be sent through the Middle West . In seven short years the Mahatma has turned from a crank to a cult . Manhattan 's sedate Metropolitan Museum has three of his canvases , and he is represented in virtually every important public and private art collection in the U. S. <P> Had the Mahatma protested less , the art world would almost certainly have accepted him sooner . Not until 1932 did dealers and critics pierce his smoke screen of self-publicity , discover that his naive , whimsical paintings were worthy of serious attention . For a song , dealers then snapped up his lush romantic landscapes , his pictures of Samoa , his moonlit fantasies , his strange nude " nymphs " bathing in improbable streams . These have since sold at high prices , while Eilshemius went in want . Last week his three Manhattan dealers agreed to cut him in on a percentage of future sales . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gone to an exhibition . At 75 , he is a cripple confined to his second-story bedroom in a gloomy , gaslit brownstone house on 57th Street . Eilshemius persists in sitting with his back to the window , his face turned away from the light . He shrills at visitors : " It 's too late to enjoy my fame . I got bad legs .
