txt  | Upon the inner and more elevated portion of the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains of the United States stream erosion of the young sediments has produced a notable arrangement of features . Here are exposed , one after another , the landward edges of the lower and older members of the whole series of gently inclined coastal-plain strata ( Fig. 141 ) . Erosion has beveled their surfaces and has exposed them so that they appear as alternate bands or belts several miles wide and many miles long which trend , in a general way , parallel with the coast . The relation of these rock strata to each other is like that of several sheets of paper piled so that , beginning at the bottommost , each protrudes a little distance beyond the one above it . If the papers were of different colors the exposure of each would produce a band or belt of color . A region in which the rock strata are so exposed is known as a belted coastal plain . It has an undulating surface and , because it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it has not the great areas of swampland that are found on its newly emerged seaward margin just previously described . Because the belts are made up of strata of lime , clay , and sand they differ in their features of soil , drainage , and relief . The sediments , although geologically young , have been somewhat consolidated by pressure and cemented by minerals deposited from solution . They are inclined toward the coast at low angles but not so low as that of the slope of the plain in. the same direction . Streams have carved more readily into the less resistant of these formations , leaving the exposed edges of the more resistant , often sandstones , standing in relief . Owing to the attitudes of the rocks , long low ridges are thus produced alternating with broad lowlands . The ridges , under humid climate , have been carved into belts of hills . They have a relief of from 100 to 00 ft. above the lowlands , trend roughly parallel to the coast , are asymmetrical , and usually present steeper faces toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation of the  | alternating ridges and lowlands above described to each other and the manner of their erosion by streams will become apparent from a study of Fig. 141 . Ridges of this kind are called cuestas . Their steeper inland faces are called escarpments ; and their gentler slopes are called dip slopes . Figure 142 shows the conspicuous ridges of the Alabama Coastal Plain , together with the pattern of the streams now adjusted to the rock structures of the region . The valleys between the ridges are called lowlands , and the innermost valley , which is adjacent to the older land , is called the inner lowland . Extensive plains that include a series of cuesta ridges and intervening lowlands may be spoken of as cuesta-Figure form plains . It happens that the broad inner lowlands on both the Alabama and Texas Coastal Plains are eroded in chalky limestones which have given rise to soils of great productivity ( 625 ) . These lowlands , which are called the Alabama Black Belt and the Texas Black Prairies , have become major centers of population and agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN OLDER SEDIMENTARY ROCKS . Many plains of gently inclined sedimentary rock , located well to the interiors of continents , show features somewhat like those of the belted coastal plain . These have been developed by stream erosion but are different from those of coastal plains because the ancient strata have been somewhat changed , by diastrophism and the cementing action of deposition by ground water , both as to their positions and as to  | their resistance to erosion . It is probable that erosion , in these older plains , since their emergence as coastal plains , has removed scores or even hundreds of feet of rock that formerly lay above the present surfaces . During this slow process the original surface of the coastal plain , with its ill-drained depressions , has completely disappeared , and the streams have adjusted themselves to the conditions of structure and hardness in the different rocks . These older and better consolidated sediments have existed through long periods of geologic history and have , in some places , been involved in minor tectonic movements which have resulted in changes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structural arches and basins . Stream carving in the rocks of which they are made has produced several distinctive kinds of plains features . Figure 382 . STREAM-ERODED 1PLAINS , YOUNG AND OLD . Although plains are lands of low relief , even they pass through the successive stages of erosional development from youth to old age . This is true of coastal and cuestaform plains no less than of others , and the features of such plains merely mark special developments due to the differential erosion of inclined sedimentary rocks . But not all stream-eroded plains have cucsta and lowland features . Some have been eroded in sediments the attitudes of which coincide so nearly with the slopes of the present surfaces that single rock strata are exposed over large areas . Others have been eroded in regions of faulted sediments , and still others in regions of crystalline rocks of great age and structural complexity , which formerly were hills or even mountains . As their erosion proceeds the landforms of these plains reflect the local peculiarities of rock structure , climatic condition , and the stage of completion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In regions where stream erosion is the principal gradational process , some plains are smooth because they are young , and the erosional process has barely begun ; some are smooth because they are old , and erosion has proceeded as far as it can ; and a few are smooth because they have been stripped down to the smooth surface of some resistant and widespread rock formation . In general , the roughness of a plain , that is , the thoroughness and depth of its stream dissection , depends upon the elevation of the plain with respect to the local baselevel and upon the stage to which the erosional cycle has advanced . Therefore , plains of whatever rock structure may be classified also , according to the stage of their erosional development , as young , mature , or old ( 355 ) . A newly emerged coastal plain is likely to be young . It may be eroded , but it can not be very rough because its baselevel is so close beneath the original surface that even mature dissection by streams can not produce deep valleys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very young , but others , where erosion is well advanced , are so rough that they reach the arbitrary limit of 500 ft. of local relief set for plains and approach hill country in appearance . Plains that have been reduced to old age by stream erosion usually have undulating surfaces . 383 . Young stream ; eroded plains are characterized by broad , smooth interfluves which are traversed at intervals by narrow , steep-walled valleys , In some young plains the major valleys have reached grade and have developed bread bottoms in which the streams meander before the tributary valleys have become so numerous as to dissect the interfluves minutely . In such plains tributary gullies may be most numerous close to the main stream , where the gradient from upland to valley flat is steep . There they dissect the valley walls , making a fringe of rough land ( sometimes called " river breaks " ) between the graded valley flat and the smooth upland . These features are particularly characteristic of plains developed under semiarid climates , such as the High Plains of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plains the broad interfluves generally are the principal sites of agricultural settlement , routes of transportation , and urban centers . Minor valleys are narrow and subject to flood . Their walls are steep and are the least usable of the plains lands . The broad bottoms of some major valleys contain usable land ; some are important commercial thoroughfares , and , in dry regions , they are more easily adapted to the requirements of irrigation agriculture than are the uplands . 384 . The Streams of Young Plains and Their Valleys . The streams of young plains have , from the beginning , relatively low gradients . This does not mean , however , that they do not have the charac-  | teristics of youth ( 351 ) but merely that the features are not so persistent . In their downward cutting they encounter rocks of unequal ? gErgaalWiltIMIL -  --  i Figure resistance and develop falls and rapids . Many of these are j ) f low ek v a tion , but , if they occur in the courses of large streams Of uniform flow ,  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because streams in plains commonly reach grade quickly , they take on the characteristics of maturity before the land through which they flow reaches erosional maturity . Therefore , by the time plains reach maturity the streams that flow through them generally have well-graded courses in which falls and rapids are infrequent or have disappeared entirely ( Fig. 130 ) . However , evidence of unequal resistance in the rocks of the valley wall sometimes persist in the form of rock benches or terraces along the valley sides . These result from differential degradation , the upper surface of a resistant rock stratum forming a terrace while its eroded edge forms the steeper slope below ( Fig. 145 ) . Figure The stream systems of young stream-eroded plains generally are dendritic , or treelike , in pattern ( Fig. ' 238 ) . In regions of horizontal strata or uniform rock they are likely to remain so throughout their development . In regions of inclined strata or diversified rocks other patterns are likely to develop only with the adjustments of streams to structure that come with more advanced erosional stages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southwestern Wisconsin , southern Missouri , the Ohio Valley , or the Highland Rim of Tennessee show a variety of forms as to both relief features and use . In plains of early maturity the interfluves , although narrowed by increasing dissection , often have more flat land than do the valleys and are the areas of principal settlement . However , their development . involves an increase in the proportion of land in slopes and a corresponding decrease in the area of flat land . In later maturity the interfluves are reduced to mere ridges ; and the farms , roads , and villages  | are more largely concentrated in the broadened valleys ( Fig. 146 ) . Examples of local variations in the patterns of relief features and cultural forms may be found in each of the regions named above and in many other maturely dissected plains . In certain plains regions of semiarid climate and nonresistant or poorly consolidated sediments mature dissection produces landforms of peculiarly intricate pattern and sharp detail . Under these conditions rapidly eroded gullies dissect the upland minutely , but there is little softening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuous rainwash . The result is a surface of a type known as badlands . Considerable areas of badlands of this kind are found in the plains of western Nebraska and the Dakotas , where they attain the relief characteristic of hills ( 483 , Fig . G239 ) . Figure 386 . Old stream-eroded plains and peneplains are characterized by broadly open valleys . The remnants of former interfluves exist as low rolling divides between the streams but are too low to have any notable relation to the human occupance and use of the plains ( Fig. 131C ) . It is probable that some peneplains have developed from the long-continued gradation of plains of horizontal sedimentary rocks , which originally had youthful relief features but have passed through the stages of maturity and old age . However , it is certain that others were originally not plains at all but mountain regions of highly complicated structures . The time required for the complete leveling of high and geologically complex mountain regions is so long , and the later stages of the process are so slow , that few if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished . Unreduced portions in the form of erosion remnants , or monadnocks , usually are to be found standing in bold relief above the general Icvcl of I heir surfaces  | as reminders of the greater heights at which the regions once stood . Moreover , although many peneplains are known , none is now found that is either very low or very flat . It may be supposed that before the slow process was finished it was interrupted by diastrophic change which elevated the land sufficiently to steepen the gradients of the streams and permit them to erode the peneplains into undulating or rolling plains whose uplands lie at the general level of the ancient surface and above which the occasional monadnocks rise still higher . Some peneplains have been so greatly elevated that portions of their former flattish surfaces are now found among the heights of hill regions or mountains . 387 . LOWLAND PENEPLAINS . Some ancient peneplains , although somewhat re-eroded. still are so comparatively level that they may be classed as Figure plains . The Appalachian Piedmont of the United States and parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cited as examples of crystalline peneplains whose present surfaces have developed under conditions of warm and humid climate . They are characterized by rolling surfaces , occasional monadnocks , and deep accumulations of weathered and leached regolith . On the Appalachian Piedmont the remnants of the ancient peneplain still are broad , although newer valleys have been carved into its surface . The uplands are the sites of the principal cultural forms and are given over largely to farming which , in many localities , has resulted in a rapid erosion of the soil . In this region also some of the monadnocks are of more than local importance . Such are Stone Mountain , near Atlanta , Ga. , King 's Mountain , famed as a battle ground in the American Revolution , Spencer Mountain , North Carolina ( Fig. 147 ) , and others . There are in some regions of arid climate areas of stream-eroded piedmont plain ( pediments ) the beveled surfaces of which are so closely associated with desert phenomena that comment upon them will be reserved- ? for  | discussion with the features developed under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas of crystalline peneplain whose present details of surface have been produced by agencies other than stream erosion . Such are the glaciated peneplains of Canada , northeastern United States , Sweden , and Finland ( 418 ) . These , too , will be considered in other connections . 388 . CITESTAFORM PLAINS . The development of interior plains by differential stream erosion on gently inclined , older sediments is not . uncommon . One special result of this process is the formation of cuestas and lowlands like those of belted coastal plains , although some are of larger size . Of that origin are the plains of much of the upper Mississippi Figure Basin . In them the escarpments of some of the cuestas present features of bold relief , the height and irregularity of their crests depending much upon the thickness and resistance of the rock formations to which they are due . In general , however , the ridges of cuestaform plains are not bold features but are dissected into belts of hills whose heights are not great when compared with the widths of the intervening lowlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England the Lincoln Wolds , the Cotswold Hills , the several Downs , and other ridges are cuestas formed by the differential erosion of inclined rock strata . Mainly the ridge-making rocks are porous chalky limestones which have resisted erosion by their absorptiveness . In the Mississippi Basin various sedimentary strata incline gently away from the old land of the Lake Superior  | Highland and disappear beneath the newer sediments of the Gulf Coastal Plain . The outcropping edges of the more resistant of them , mainly sandy or cherty limestones and dolomites , form a series of cuesta ridges ( 321 , Fig. 148 ) . One of these is the Military Ridge of southwestern Wisconsin . Another , and a most persistent one , is the Niagara cuesta , an outcrop of a hard magnesian limestone . It traverses northern Illinois , eastern Wisconsin , upper Michigan , and peninsular Ontario and finally dies out in western New York . Its projecting crest is the cause of the Door Peninsula of Wisconsin , the Manitoulin Islands , the Bruce Peninsula of Ontario , and the escarpment that gives rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these cuestaform ridges are undulating farm lands , although in central Wisconsin the inner lowland is a broad and relatively infertile sand plain resting upon an underlying sandstone . Minor features upon these plains include groups of hills which are remnants of the cuesta escarpments , detached and left isolated by differential weathering and erosion . Such hills , which lie out beyond the margin of the main body of the rock of which they are composed , are called outliers . They are exemplified by the Mounds of southern Wisconsin . The same processes have given some of these outlying hills bold or even fantastic and castellated forms . 390 . PLAINS OF CONCENTRIC RIDGES AND LOWLANDS . In the long histories of the older sedimentary rocks have occurred minor changes of level which have resulted in widespread and gentle warping of the rocks . Some such are expressed in various of the curves of the cuesta ridges shown in Fig. 148 . Others resulted in low broad structural arches or domes or equally broad structural basins . The latter include several rock strata , some of considerable resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shallow saucers of decreasing size . The subsequent differential erosion of a structural basin produces a series of roughly concentric lowlands and cuestas with out facing escarpments . The Paris Basin of France is a notable example of a plain of this class ( Fig. 149 ) . Its five or six low cuestaform ridges have been partially dissected by streams and stand as concentric but broken ridges upon a fertile plain . The shapes , heights , and arrangements of these cuesta ridges have played important parts in the appearance of the plain , its agricultural uses , the pattern of its avenues of transportation , and the military defense of Paris , which is its natural focus . The London Basin is a similar , though somewhat elongated , structure which is traversed on its major axis by the Thames River . Structural arches or domes , when subsequently their tops are attacked and removed by weathering and erosion , also produce concentric lowlands and cuestaform ridges but with in facing escarpments . In England , for example , the south flank of the London Basin forms I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are called the  | North Downs and the South Downs . Their escarpments face in upon the sands and clays of a rolling plain called The Weald ( Fig. 150 ) . 391 . Important American Plains of Concentric Features . In the United States there are several notable examples of plains formed by the erosion of structural arches . The most important are those developed by the erosion Figure of a long low arch which extends from southwestern Ohio to northern Alabama . Upon it are two oval cuestaform plains . These are the Bluegrass Region of Kentucky and the Nashville Basin of Tennessee . Each is about the size of the state of Connecticut . The upper formations of the arch primarily are composed of sandstones and other siliceous rocks from which are derived soils of rather low fertility . In Tennessee this is called the Highland Rim ( Fig. 151 ) . In the basins the removal of the overlying rocks has exposed easily weathered limestones , one of them a phosphatic limestone . The degradation of these less resistant rocks is responsible for the formation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are noted for their productivity ( Fig. 152 ) . About the margins of the basins are  | many outliers , isolated remnants of the rim rock that have been detached by differential erosion and left in the form of conical hills upon the basin plain . These are so thickly distributed that they form a fringe which , in Kentucky , is called the region of the Knobs . Figure Figure 392 . SOLUTION FEATURES . In various parts of the world are small plains , and there are some of considerable size , the distinctive surface features of which result from the solvent work of underground water rather than from stream erosion . They may be called karst plains ( 350 ) .  | Regions of this kind are underlain by sediments which include layers of pure limestone . In some karst plains the soluble limestones make up the surface rock formations and are covered only by residual earth ; in others they lie beneath some thicknesses of other rocks . In either case , however , the surface features show evidence of the removal of material beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream-eroded plains , karst plains are distinguished by a general absence of valleys . They are not always entirely lacking , since some large streams originating in border areas may cut entirely across a karst plain . Small valleys , however , generally are not numerous , some districts of hundreds of square miles ' extent having few if any . Instead of stream-eroded drainage patterns , karst plains have undulating , rolling , or sometimes rough surfaces in which numerous depressions without visible outlets are separated by low irregular ridges or hillocks without definite pattern of arrangement . Some of the Figure depressions are large and irregular in outline ; others are small and nearly circular . The depressions and their intervening ridges resul from the unequal solution of the underlying limestones . Some of the basins are produced by surface solution , the water finding its outlet . through the bottom into solution caverns , along joints , or into other underground channels . Some , on the other hand , appear to be the result of the subsidence of the roofs of former caverns . They vary in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several miles in extent . Commonly they are designated by the general term sink ( Fig. 153 ) . Some sinks are many feet deep , are steep-sided , and have obvious openings through which the surface drainage runs underground . Others are so shallow as almost to escape notice . In some the bottom outlets are partially or wholly stopped by clay or other materials , and the drainage escapes so slowly that swamps , temporary lakes , or even permanent lakes accumulate in them . Seldom , however , do the lakes rise to the point where they overflow their basins and spill into neighboring depressions through surface channels . Associated with the underground drainage of karst , plains is the formation of numerous caverns , mainly small , which in . sunie regions  | thoroughly honeycomb the soluble limestones beneath . Fed by surface drainage , the waters of many solution cavities pass along joint plains or dissolved channels and sometimes join ultimately in underground streams of considerable size or issue as springs of remarkable volume ( 538 ) . In a few karst areas thick limestone formations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent , such as Mammoth Cave , Kentucky . The partial collapse of cavern roofs in these regions results also in the formation of natural bridges . Features of that kind are not uncommon , but mainly they are of small size . Figure 393 . NOTABLE KARST REGIONS . Areas of solution features take their name from the Karst , a rough denuded limestone plateau and hill region which lies back of the Adriatic shore of Yugoslavia . Of the same rock type is the neighboring lowland of Apulia , the rolling plain of the " heel " of Italy . Broad sinks , there called dolines , are interspersed among barren limestone uplands . Because the sinks are low and soil floored they are the principal tilled areas , but in the rainy season the underdrainage can not remove the inflowing water fast enough to prevent them from being very wet or even flooded . Other karst plains are found in North America , especially on limestone platforms bordering the Gulf of Mexico . The most extensive of these are located in Florida , Cuba , and the peninsula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain . Although its central portion reaches elevations of 500 ft. , most of it is less than 100 ft. above sea level . It has an average annual rainfall of about 35 in. , but the landscape appears to be dry . There are no streams . Here , according to Huntington , a rocky surface , strewn with fragments of impure limestone , drains into numerous sinks , called by their Indian name cenotes , most of which are steep-sided , cavernlike , and vary in depth from 25 ft. near the coast to as much as 400 ft. in the higher localities . At the bottoms of the sinks are springs and pools of water which , in former times , were the principal sources of water supply . The principal Cuban karst area is a broad strip of undulating plain 150 miles in length south of Habana . It differs from the Yucatan plain in  | being covered by deep porous red earth . Sinkholes are not numerous , yet the plain is almost streamless because the surface water drains quickly through the porous soil into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida shares with the adjacent karst regions a substratum of soluble limestone . Unlike the others it is Figure covered in large part by sands of some depth , but occasionally there are admixtures of thin strata of clay . Some parts of this plain have surface features that obviously are of karst type . Sinkholes of all sizes are separated by low sandy ridges , or hills ; small caverns are numerous ; and underground drainage issues in springs , one of which has the largest flow of water of any spring in the United States . The region as a whole is not without surface streams , but one of its most persistent characteristics is its lakes , ponds , and pools , of which there are thousands ( Fig. 154 ) . Some of these are known to lie in solution depressions which have their underdrainage impeded by accumulations of clay over their bottoms . It is probable that most if not all the depressions are of that origin or resuit from the collapse of cavern roofs . In addition to the depressions occupied by water are thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to escape notice , which either are ill drained or are water filled or swampy for at least a part of the year ( Fig. 155 ) . Another karst region in the United States is the undulating to rough plain in south central Kentucky which is underlain by a cavernous limestone . Considerable parts of this region are so dominated by solution features that sinks and their associated knolls and ridges are the principal relief features . Under primitive forest conditions many if not most of the sinks had free underdrainage . Since clearing , soil erosion has stripped clay from the adjacent hills and deposited it in sinks until many of them now are ill drained and contain at least temporary ponds . In the underlying limestone are many springs and caverns , often with hillside openings . Mammoth Cave , in this region , is widely known for its giant cavities and great underground extent .  | 394 . ALLUVIAL PLAINS . Alluvium may be thought of as weathered and eroded material which has been halted in stream transit between higher lands and the sea . Attention has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also to the manner and some of the characteristic places of their deposition ( 356 ) . It may be emphasized now that , with minor exceptions , alluvium is deposited in the form of plains , and usually in flat plains , where it is spread out and awaits a future removal and the continuance of its transportation . In terms of the length of geologic time alluvial plains are temporary structures . Some , indeed , are of very recent origin ; their accumulation still is in progress , and their surface forms record the manner of their upbuilding and certain of the incidents in the process . Others are vastly older ; the details of the manner of their construction and incidents in the process are lost ; and their surfaces are characterized rather by features that mark stages in the progress of their destruction . These are distinguished by the term older alluvium . The details of surface form in four principal classes of alluvial plains may be considered . These are ( a ) delta plains , ( b ) flood plains , ( c ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older alluvium . Delta Plains 395 . THE GREAT DELTA PLAINS . Delta plains are the surfaces of newly built-up accumulations of river sediment which is deposited at the mouths of streams upon their entry into bodies of quiet water . Not all great streams have deltas , but all great deltas are the deposits of large streams . Some of the most extensive delta plains may readily be discovered on the maps of a student atlas . They are the delta of the Nile , from which all such deposits take their name ( its triangular central portion resembles in shape the letter 0 of the Greek alphabet ) , and the deltas of the Po , Rhine , Indus , Ganges , Irrawaddy , Hwang , 82.5  | Orinoco , and Mississippi . There are as many more delta plains of almost equal size , but less well known , while of small deltas there are thousands ( Fig. 156 ) . 396 . THE DELTA OUTLINE . The process of delta building , previously noted ( 357 ) , is the cause of some peculiarities of delta shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delta through the seaward extension of the distributary channels causes it to have a tendency to present to the sea a somewhat digitate ( fingerlike ) outline . This feature is pronounced in the case of the Mississippi Delta ( Fig. 157 ) , but it is less noticeable in some others and is hardly apparent on the delta of the Hwang . Figure The manner of delta formation by addition to both the surface and the margin is responsible not only for the shape of the delta margin and its surface features but also for a great deal of the trouble and labor that are the lot of most delta . inhabitants . 397 . THE DELTA SURFACE . Although it is true that delta plains are very flat , since they generally have local relief of much less than 50 ft. , they are not without significant differences in elevation . The seaward margin of the delta is lowest . There is the newest formed portion of the surface which continues out beneath the sea a little distance . Films of the finest mud are added to the seaward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and silt and sand are thrown up there by the deposition of waves and currents . This seaward margin is built up so slowly and is so flat that , on large deltas , vast . areas of the coastal fringe are little above salt water , and beyond the shoreline the coastal waters are exceedingly shallow except nea the mouths of the principal distributaries . Along the delta border are marshy islands of new sediment , and it is traversed by a network of shallow and sluggish channels . The upstream portion of the delta . is highest , and it grows in height as the delta increases in age and extends in area . As the distributary channels lengthen by building seaward , the stream gradient is thereby flattened , causing a decrease in stream velocity . This in turn causes the stream to drop sediruerll in its own channel and to overflow its banks and deposit material upnnl the delta surface . Flooding is repeated , and the surface is built up Miles  | until a uniform gradient is maintained ( Fig. 164 ) . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large deltas . The highest portions of the upper delta of the Mississippi , which lie nearly 200 miles from the river mouth , are only about 40 ft. higher than the delta margin . Figure The features of greatest relief upon the delta surface are its natural levees ( 357 ) . These are low and broad ridges of alluvium which border the stream channels on either side ( Fig. 158 ) . They are found along the main stream of the delta , along its distributary channels , and also along the smaller independent streams which traverse the surfaces of large deltas . They are highest near the banks of the stream that Figure builds them but , at least on the Mississippi Delta , rise no more than 15 or 20 ft. above the adjacent delta surface . They are both higher and broader on the older upstream . portion of a delta than near its newer seaward margin . From their crests they slope away from the stream with surfaces so gently inclined that , to the eye , they appear  | perfectly flat . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the levees along the stream banks are generally well drained , their lower portions which slope away from the stream end in fringing swamps . The width of the great upper-delta levees of the Mississippi , between river bank and swampland , commonly is from one to two miles on either side of the river . The levees of the great river near its mouth and also of the smaller delta streams may be only a few yards wide , and in the salt marshes of the seaward fringe no levees may be yet developed ( Fig. 159 ) . It is characteristic of the levees of delta streams and distributary channels that they become lower and narrower downstream until they taper to points in the coastal marshes and there disappear ( Fig. 157 ) . Figure Because the levees are the highest and best drained portions of the delta surface , they are the principal sites of human settlement . Houses and towns are found upon them , and roads and railways tend to follow them and to parallel the streams . Farms occupy the gently sloping surfaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For protection against stream overflow artificial levees are , in some places , built near the stream upon the top of the natural levees . In times of high water on the Mississippi Delta the river surface may rise nearly to the top of the artificial levees or even overflow them . At such times it stands several feet higher than the roads and farms on the natural levees behind them and many feet above the swamps beyond . A break in the artificial levees at that time permits the flooding of a large part of the delta surface , and water may completely submerge the smaller levees of the lesser streams or even the great levees themselves ( Fig. 160 ) . On some great deltas , such as that . of the Ganges River , no artificial levees have been built , and both the  | delta swamps and the natural levees are regularly flooded in the rainy season . There the inhabitants have built compact mounds of earth on which are located their houses and village settlements barely above the reach of high water . 398 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the fact that its streams flow down the middle of broad levee ridges at Figure elevations slightly higher than the average surface of the plain create a difficult problem in drainage . They also give rise to some of the characteristic features of deltas , such as broad marshes and shallow lakes . Upon this peculiar surface , where the rivers are higher than the plain , surplus water from rainfall or river overflow can not join the main river drainage because it would have to flow uphill to do so . As a consequence the water accumulates in the low flat areas between the distributary channels in the form of swamps or shallow lakes or finds its independent way to the sea through sluggish creeks which wind across the fringe of coastal marshes . It might be expected that these low areas between the levee ridges would gradually fill with  | sediment as a result of stream overflow through breaks in the levees . It may be , however , that the great weight of the load of sediment deposited on the levees results in a slow diastrophic depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the low areas between the distributaries in a continuous state of near submergence , resulting in swamps and lakes . Figure 157 shows the distribution of the principal lakes and marshes of the Mississippi Delta with respect to the major and minor drainage channels and their levees . The swamps of the higher delta contain fresh water and are high enough so that many of them are periodically dry . Before the day of the lumberman they were occupied mainly by a natural vegetation of water-tolerant trees , especially the gumwoods and cypress . The swamps of the lower delta and its seaward margin are of two types . Those situated on the low natural levees are wooded , like those of the upstream delta , while those in the still lower interdistributary areas and on the coastal fringe and islands are so little above sea level that they are easily inundated by the sea and have brackish waters . They are never dried out and are covered mainly by vast expanses of tall coarse grasses , the habitat of numberless muskrats. 399 . Popunous DELTAS . Some deltas , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The delta surfaces are flat and are composed of new , unleashed , and therefore fertile , soils , the silts and clays derived from the great variety of rocks found in the drainage basins of great river systems . Although in their natural state most deltas contain large areas of swampland , their food-producing capacity is large . On the populous deltas the ever-increasing need for land to yield food for so many people has led to most intensive uses of the delta surfaces . The inhabitants of parts of the Ganges Delta , for example , grow a long-stemmed variety of rice whose rapid growth keeps pace with the rising waters of the flood season . The people of some other delta regions have found it necessary to change some of the natural features of the delta or to alter the normal processes of stream overflow and deposit of sediment . Means of better adapting the features of delta surface to human use are found in the stupendous drainage projects of the Rhine Delta and in the irrigation projects of the Nile and other deltas . 400 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meuse , and Scheldt Rivers . Originally the region had the features common to delta surfaces , and the streams , by flood , built their levees and extended the coastal marshes seaward . Through several centuries a growing need for land has encouraged the inhabitants of this region to reclaim the marsh lands and actually to crowd the sea off the delta margin . Small areas of  | lower levee and interleTvee swampland have been , one after another , made secure from flood by constructing artificial levees , or dikes , entirely around them . Each enclosed area , called a polder , is kept sufficiently drained for agriculture by a network of drainage ditches leading to a pump at the lowest Figure corner of the polder . This lifts the water from the polder into a bordering stream or canal which lies between or in channels on top of the dikes . In time new polders were made near the old , and eventually the sea was encroached upon . Now large areas of drained lands lie between 5 and 10 ft. , and some are as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polders , of which there are hundreds , are irregular in outline and formerly were pumped by picturesque windmills . The newer ones , designed with modern engineering skill , are larger and more regular in shape and are pumped by engines . The newest and greatest project has been designed to cut off and drain the Zuider Zee , a great and shallow coastal embayment , which was much like Lake Pontchartrain near New Orleans ( Fig. 161 ) . 401 . The great delta of North China is comprised largely of loessial silts derived from the highlands of North China and deposited by the Hwang and some other streams . So abundant are the sediments that they have filled a broad embayment of the Hwang Hai ( Yellow Sea ) and half surround a large , hilly island which once stood in it . This former island is now the Shantung Peninsula ( Fig. 162 ) . The Hwang flows across the northern part of its plain on a levee ridge which in places is as much as 20 ft. high . It is depositing silt so rapidly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and , like the Mississippi , spreads over the adjacent delta surface . Owing to the silting of its channel the Hwang is of little use for navigation . At times of low water the inhabitants remove large quantities of silt from the stream bed partly to keep the channel open and partly because of the value of the mud as a fertilizer . The rapid aggradation of the delta surface near the stream is attended by the danger of a  | sudden change in its course during time of flood . Some of the changes are minor , but the stream has several times shifted its course to the opposite side of the Shantung Peninsula . Such a change , on a densely peopled plain , is a major disaster . In 1852 the stream changed from a course on the south Figure side of the plain to near its present course on the north side of the Peninsula and emptied into the sea more than 250 miles distant from its former mouth . In addition to the several major changes , there are unnumbered smaller ones recorded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied by appalling loss of human life . 402 . The Great Delta Plains of Arid Lands . A few of the great delta plains of the world are in the coasts of deserts , They are built by large streams that are fed by the abundant precipitation of mountain regions and have sufficient volume to flow completely across the desert areas with few tributaries and to discharge their loads of sediment into the bordering seas . Such may be called exotic streams . Outstanding among them are the Nile , the Tigris-Euphrates , the Indus , and the Colorado . The delta of the first named has a density of human population comparable with that of the plain of North China . The people are supported by agriculture which depends almost wholly upon the practice of irrigation , to which the configuration of the delta surface lends itself well . In these arid-Land deltas the main problem is not , as in the Netherlands , to get the water up from the delta surface into the distributary channels but to get it from the channels out upon the delta surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water it may be accomplished by gravity alone . In times of low water lifting may be resorted to , or , by damlike structures , the river level may be raised until only a small lift , if any , is required , to take water out through ditches in the levees , whence it may be distributed by gravity down the gentle back slopes of the levees which are the cultivated farm lands . The deltas and floodplains of these major exotic streams , therefore , constitute one class of desert oasis . They are the largest and most productive oases in the world . The Nile , after receiving its last important tributary , traverses 1,000 miles of desert , where it loses volume by the removal of water for irrigat ion , by evaporation , and by seepage . It arrives at the upper delta much decreased in volume . On the delta so much more water is required for irrigasudden change in its course during time of flood . Some of the changes are minor , but thestream has several times shifted its course to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on a densely peopled plain , is a major disaster . In 1852 the stream changed from a course on the south SOME OF THE MANY DELTA COURSES OF THE HWANGH. side of the plain to near its present EMNIGHLANDS DELTA course on the north side of the Peninsula and emptied into the sea more than 250 miles distant  | tion that only a little is discharged through the distributary mouths into the Mediterranean Sea . Several important consequences arise from this fact . ( a ) There are no disastrous floods on the Nile Delta . ( b ) So much sediment is discharged on the delta head and so little about its margins that the surface has a slope of about 60 ft. per 100 miles , three times that of the Missis-Figure sippi Delta . ( c ) The steeper slope and smaller water supply make drainage easier . Nearly the whole surface is cultivated , and lakes and swamps are found only about the delta margins . The delta of the Colorado River has been built into and across the northern portion ? of the long tectonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built in from the east and after extending across to the western wall of the depression it blocked off about 150 miles of the former upper end of the Gulf . Evaporation of the water there has left the plain called the Salton Basin , a part of whose floor lies nearly 275 ft. below sea level . Water from the Colorado River is distributed by ditches over the surface of the delta for the irrigation of crops . Although the river now discharges southward into the Gulf of California it has several times shifted to a northward distributary and emptied into the low basin called Salton Sink ( Fig. 163 ) . The whole delta area is known as the Imperial Valley . Floodplains 403 . FLOODPLAIN AND DELTA . Floodplains are the alluvial deposits spread by aggrading streams upon the floors of their valleys Figure during the process of valley widening and stream overflow ( 357 ) . The floodplain begins to form in the lower course of the stream where it first reaches grade . This is the same point at which the delta begins to  | form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 397 ) causes frequent stream overflow , during which sediment is deposited not only at the delta head but also in the lower stream valley and thence progressively upstream ( Fig. 164 ) . Thus the two are blended , and it is difficult to say just where delta ends and floodplain begins . However , some streams that have no deltas have well-developed floodplains. 404 . TI1E WIDTH OF FLOODPLAINS . Floodplains are confined within the bluffs cut by the lateral erosion of a meandering stream ( 354 ) . The valley walls may not be high , and usually they are much gullied , but they mark an abrupt change from a stream-dissected upland on the one hand to a flat plain of recent alluvium on the other ( Fig. 165 ) . The width of a floodplain , i.e. , the distance from one Figure valley wall to the other , depends much upon the size of the stream that builds it and upon its stage of advancement in the cycle of river development . In the valleys of small but aggrading creeks it may be only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plains may be of any width up to several miles . Usually they narrow in the upstream direction toward the headwaters , where the tributary streams may be so young as to have no floodplains at all . The Mississippi floodplain , where the stream flows between Iowa and Wisconsin , is from 1 to 3 miles wide ; in the latitude of southern Illinois it is about 6 miles ; but below Cairo it broadens rapidly and , including the plains of minor streams that join it , ranges between 25 and 75 miles in width . It is reported that the floodplain of the lower Amazon , the greatest of all rivers , generally is less than 30 miles wide . ' Footnote  | 405 . THE FLOODPLAIN SURFACE . The surface features and the conditions of drainage that characterize the typical floodplain are similar to those of the upstream part of a delta . It is comprised principally of a monotonously flat surface upon which areas of levee land alternate with areas of swamp . On small floodplains the levees that border the stream often are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meander bends , they are likely to be enough higher than the remainder of the floodplain so that they interfere with the drainage of water from the bluffs toward the stream . For that Figure reason swamps or marshy spots are likely to be found toward the margins of the plain between the stream and the valley walls ( Fig. 166 ) . The distribution of levee and swamplands on broader floodplains usually is not so simple as that indicated above . The valley floor is a place of rapid change . It is widened and shaped by erosion and deposiIion which go on at the same time . It is the work of a meandering stream which touches first one valley wall and then the other . A meander curve becomes elongated by erosion on the lower outside of its bend and by deposition of the inside ( Fig. 132 ) . By this process also the meanders themselves tend to migrate slowly in the downstream direction , changing both their shapes and their positions . In times of high water their changes are rapid . Increased volume gives temporarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much sediment upon the immediate stream banks ,  | raising the levees . The general effect of these activities is that alluvium is picked up in one locality and put down in another , distributed and redistributed over the valley floor , and that levees are broadened by overflow here and narrowed or lowered by erosion there . Eventually meanders that have grown overlong are cut off and abandoned by the stream when it shortens its course by cutting through a narrowed neck of alluvium ( Fig. 129E ) . The ends of the abandoned meander channel presently are filled with silt , and the unfilled portion exists as a horseshoe-shaped pond , or oxbow lake , bordered by its levees . Lakes of this kind no sooner are formed than they begin to be filled Figure and obliterated ( a ) by sediment deposited during general river floods , ( b ) by rain-washed sediment from the adjacent surface , and ( c ) by the growth and decay of aquatic vegetation . The surfaces of broad floodplains are likely , therefore , to contain many oxbow lakes in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formation , appear as curving open lakes ; some contain but the dwindled remnants of abandoned channels ; others remain as boggy , sedge-filled marshes ; while still others may be described only as meander scars . The latter are marked only by bits of woodland swamp or low ground , the horseshoe-shaped outlines of which hardly would be noticed save from an airplane ( Fig. 167 ) . Associated with each of these abandoned channels are sections of abandoned levees , also in various stages of destruction ( Fig. 168 ) .  | Another element in the pattern of the broad floodplain is furnished by small tributary streams . Small streams entering the plain from the bordering uplands are sometimes prevented from joining the main stream at once because of the upward slope of its natural levees . Instead they turn down valley and , after paralleling the main stream some distance , find a place of entrance . The junction of the St. Francis and Yazoo Rivers with the Mississippi ( Fig. 169 ) illustrates this condition . To the features of the floodplain , therefore , are added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created by tributary Figure streams . In consequence , the broad floodplain is likely to have a complicated pattern which may consist of meandering stream channels , large and small ; of new levee lands ; old subdued levees ; oxbow lakes and their swampy remnants ; together with broad floodplain marshes . The silts and clays deposited on broad floodplains make productive soils , and generally they are used for agriculture . The levee lands are naturally the best drained and are the first to be used . On the Mississippi floodplain large areas of swampland remain unreclaimed . On some 01 ( 1 World floodplains , however , such as those of the Nile and Yangtze , where land is scarce and life and labor cheap , even the swamps are drained and cultivated .  | 406 . ALLIIVIAL TERRACE LANDS . Many floodplains are fringed at intervals with smaller alluvial plains which stand at elevations Figure somewhat above that of the present plain . These are called alluvial terraces , or benches . Although they lie above the floodplain they are unlike the valley walls which flank them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bordered by abrupt descents of a few feet to the level of the newer plain . They are the remnants of older and higher floodplains into which the stream has subsequently eroded a new plain , owing to some cause that has decreased its load of sediment or has increased its carrying capacity . Some valleys exhibit a series of alluvial terraces at different levels which mark stages in the erosion of the old valley filling ( Fig. 170 ) . Although alluvial terraces seldom are high or continuous , they fre-quently contain many acres and sometimes many square miles of land . Because alluvial terrace land is sufficiently above present river level to be free from floods , it generally is well Figure drained and admirably adapted to cultivation . However , because the terrace is above the present flood level its soils are no longer  | enriched by additions of alluvial mud and , being older , they are , in regions of abundant rainfall , likely to be somewhat leached . Sites of this kind are suitable also for river towns . The inhabitants of floodplains commonly distinguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them as " first bottoms , " " second bottoms , " etc. 407 . FLOonpLAINs AND RIVER FLOODS . The flatness of floodplains , the nature and direction of their levee slopes , and indeed the very mariner of their formation indicate that they are subject to river overflow . In some rivers floods are of periodic occurrence , and in others they come at irregular intervals , while some streams are so controlled by nature as to be little subject to flood . The causes of river flooding are many . Some of them are natural while others are the result of human interference with natural conditions . Usually the most disastrous floods are at least partly the result of human disturbance of the balance of conditions established by nature . Periodic floods , such as those of the Nile , the Orinoco , and other tropical streams , result from the marked seasonal character in the savanna type of precipitation over the river basin . Nile floods have been for many centuries the means of renewing the fertility of the alluvial soil of that populous valley by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have served also to store water in the soil of the arid land to aid in the maturing of crops . The recent construction of dams reduces the inconvenience of floods and enables a more economical use of both the land and the water , but it largely prevents the distribution of the fertile mud over the floodplain by causing it to settle in the quiet waters above the dams . The alternation of protracted drought with widespread flood on the floodplain of the Orinoco has so far had the effect of retarding attempts to make effective use of that broad and flat plain . Disastrous floods on the Mississippi and its tributaries usually occur in the early spring . They result from heavy rainfall on a frozen or saturated earth , frequently supplemented by the rapid melting of a winter 's accumulation of snow . Sometimes both of these conditions come at the same time in different parts of the basin . The general deforestation of the eastern half of the Mississippi Basin during its settlement and agricultural utilization probably has increased the flood menace by removing the forest litter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As settlement on the Mississippi floodplain increased , protection from flood became as necessary as it did on the delta . Artificial levees of earth were extended from the delta to the floodplain and now total hundreds of miles in length . It was found that the height of the early levees was not sufficient to prevent overflow , and their level has been raised several times . In consequence of the building of higher levees the river has been forced to transport material that otherwise would have been spread over the floodplain . This in turn has caused silting of the channel and a raising of the river grade . As the levees have increased in height , therefore , so have the succeeding floods ,  | and there is no more security from them now than formerly . The problem of flood control is one given much study , but the method of its solution is complicated and , as yet , by no means certain . k. break in the artificial levee in time of severe flood pours a torrent of water upon the floodplain , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond control large areas may be completely inundated except for a few sections of higher levee . Upon these gather the refugees , both human and animal ( Fig. 160 ) . The inhabitants of isolated bits of low older-levee lands back ill the swamps sometimes have no opportunity to reach the higher artificial levee or any other place of safety in time to escape the rising waters . The lower floodplain and delta courses of many streams are protected from Hood by artificial levees as those of the Mississippi are . Notable examples are seen on the floodplains of the Yangtze , the Po , and other streams whose fertile lands are densely peopled . Piedmont Alluvial Plains 408 . ALLUVIAL FANS . Piedmont alluvial plains are made up of alluvial fans so closely spaced that their margins are merged in one continuous plain . Previous reference has been made to the mariner and place of formation of alluvial fans and to the conditions under which they tend to merge . It was noted also that they attain their greatest development in regions of dry or subhumid climate ( 357 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plains ma , y be understood better if the configuration of the simple alluvial fan is first considered . in some respects the processes and forms of fan growth are like those of the delta but in others significantly different . Streams with steep gradients furnish abundant . sediment , much of it coarse in texture . The material clogs the stream channel at the point where the mountain gradient changes to that of the bordering plain . The choked stream breaks over its banks , tending to form distributary channels with natural levees , as in the delta . However , the fan distributaries do not , like those of the delta , continue so long in the same course as to build fingerlike projections at their ends . Instead , the rapid accumulation of material encourages frequent shifts of channel which have the effect of causing the building to proceed evenly upon all parts of the fan margin . This produces a nicely rounded or semicircular outline and gives the feature its fanlike shape ( Fig. 133 ) . The deposition of material , especially the heavy or coarse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fan , where the stream velocity is first checked . The finer material is carried farther out and is spread upon the fan margins . As the feature grows in size , the ordinary flow of the stream that produces it may be wholly absorbed by seepage into the coarse upper-fan deposits , and all its load of sediment may he  | put down there . Only in time of flood may the enlarged stream have sufficient volume to flow completely across the fan and beyond . This condition results in the upper part of the fan 's having the steeper slopes while those toward the margin grow progressively more gentle . However , although the slope of a fan surface is characteristically steeper than that of the delta surface , not even the upper slopes of a great fan are very steep , and its marginal areas are so gently sloping as to seem an almost flat and featureless plain . The slopes of the fan Figure are , moreover , not merely in one direction from the mountain base but extended radially from the fan head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of great convenience in use of irrigation water . Because of the radial slope of the fan , irrigation water applied at its upper end may be distributed by gravity to all parts of the fan surface . 409 . PIEDMONT ALLUVIAL PLAINS . The bases of mountain slopes in dry and subhumid climates commonly are fringed by alluvial plains comprised of coalesced fans , some of which are large and some small , their size depending upon the volumes and deposits of the several streams draining the mountain front . The heads of the several fans may be distinguished at the mouths of the valleys ( Fig. 171 ) . They are  | composed largely of gravel and sand , and their surfaces often are strewn with boulders distributed by flood waters following torrential rains in the mountains . The porosity of these coarse soils , their inability to retain irrigation water , and their bouldery surfaces cause the higher parts of the fans to be somewhat avoided for intensive agricultural use Figure although they may furnish gravel and sand for constructional purposes ( Fig. 172 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bordering fans flatten out , their soils become finer , their margins spread , and they merge into a continuous alluvial plain ( Fig. 173 ) . Figure Such a plain may appear practically level , yet it is not so in fact . Not only does it slope away from the mountain base but each of its component fans has its faintly convex surface , and where they arc blended together the resulting plain has a scalloped margin . Between the individual fans are broad shallow depressions.  | Many piedmont alluvial plains are covered only with desert shrubs or sparse grasses , but the fine dry-land soils are high in mineral plant foods , and such as have available supplies of irrigation water are capable of great productivity . Although their surfaces are dry , natural conditions provide many alluvial fans with supplies of water for irrigation . ( a ) The water of the mountain stream that builds a fan may be impounded in its mountain valley whence it may be led out upon the fan surface . ( b ) The natural stream flow disappears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fan head . However , it collects underground in the great storage reservoir of the porous fan material and slowly seeps outward toward the fan margin . This water commonly is recovered for use in irrigation , in some regions through wells , and in others , as in parts of Asia , through tunnels driven underneath the fan surface . Just as the floodplains above some irrigated deltas are irrigated , as in the case of the Nile , so are some of the floodplains below or beyond the lower margins of alluvial fans . Provided the supply of water is sufficient , it is sometimes led by canals out beyond the irrigated areas of the fans and applied to the alluvial valley bottoms as far as the supply permits . The slopes of fans and piedmont alluvial plains may be recognized , therefore , as a second class of oasis only a little less extensive than that associated with the deltas and floodplains of exotic streams ( 402 ) . 410 . ALLUVIAL BASIN PLAINS . Some structural basins or valleys are nearly encircled by fans which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which slope gently upward on all their margins . Beneath some such plains the accumulated fan deposits are deep , and the basins are said to be alluvium filled . The mountain drainage which seeps through the porous upper parts of the fans in a filled basin sometimes reappears as ground water about the lower edges of the concentric fans . For that reason alluvium-filled basins , even under arid climate , commonly have at their centers areas of marsh , shallow lakes , or alkali flats ( 438 ) . 411 . NOTED PIEDMONT ALLUVIAL PLAINS . Because piedmont alluvial plains have deep fertile soils and are admirable sites for the practice of irrigation , some of them , which have abundant and dependable water supplies , are noted for their agricultural wealth . Among them are the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys of California , the Los Angeles-San Bernardino lowland of Southern California , the Vale of Chile , the Samarkand district of Russian Turkistan , the Tarim Basin , and many others . Conditions in the San Joaquin Valley illustrate the landforms developed by valley filling . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a structural trough between the Sierra Nevada Mountains and the Coast Ranges . From the latter more than 50 small wet-weather streams flow eastward into the basin bringing alluvium which is spread in a seemingly flat  | and quite featureless plain along the western margin of the valley . Drainage from the abundant snows and rains on the windward , west-facing slopes of the higher Sierra Nevada Mountains is carried down to the eastern mar-Figure gin of the valley by eight large streams and more than a dozen smaller ones . These have contributed alluvium to the general filling of the valley and have , in addition , built large alluvial fans . The largest of the fans is that of Kings River . It spreads outward into the valley 50 miles from the mountain base , crosses the axis of the structural trough , and blocks the drainage of its dry southern end ( Fig. 174 ) . Thus Tulare and Buena Vista Lakes are created , and areas about the margins of the fans are made marshy . Large supplies of irrigation water from the snowy Sierras supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned each great fan into an oasis upon which there is an intensive agriculture devoted principally to fruits . This contrasts sharply with the extensive , livestock-ranch type of agriculture which prevails on the unirrigated western margin of the plain . 412 . DELTA FANS . Some streams that have fairly steep gradients and are abundantly supplied with sediment enter the sea and build deltas . As these grow , their flat surfaces serve further to check stream velocity , fans form upon the delta tops , and the two grow in association . Such features may be called delta fans , and some of them are of great size . The delta of the Colorado River is , in fact , a large delta fan . Small delta fans occupy fringing embayments of many mountainous coasts , as , for example , in Japan , where various of the small marginal plains are delta fans . Some of them are bounded on the landward side by the abrupt escarpments of recent faults . These steep slopes , composed in part of volcanic ash , older alluvium , and other easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the streams , even in that rainy climate , can not transport it fast enough to prevent the accumulation of fans . In a land so generally mountainous as Japan , these fragmentary but fertile plains are densely peopled and intensively used . Of similar construction are the productive lowlands of Valencia , Spain , and the Canterbury Plain , a gently sloping plain 40 miles wide and 175 miles long on the east coast of South Island , New Zealand . Each of them , however , is made up of the combined delta fans of several streams which drain the bordering mountains , and they might properly be called " piedmont alluvial delta-fan plains , " if one wished to employ a term so awkward . Plains of Older Alluvium 413 . THE NATURE OF OLDER ALLUVIUM . Certain of the worlds considerable plains are described as plains of older alluvium . The  | material composing them differs from that of recent alluvial plains in being much older . In humi I climates it is generally much leached and less fertile . In some regions it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long deposited that their surfaces have lost most of the distributary channels , levees , and other forms characteristic of recent alluvial plains and now have features that are more the result of erosion than of deposition . In consequence of these changes they generally are well drained . The internal structure of such plains betrays their origin , however , for they are unlike the wellstratified , marine sediments of coastal plains in that they are made up of the irregularly bedded deposits of ancient streams . The largest plains of this type are distributed beyond the margins of great mountain systems and were no doubt , at the time of their formation , vast piedmont alluvial plains . Subsequent diastrophic or other changes of condition have caused the present streams that cross them to cut new valleys into the surfaces of the plains and to build floodplains of new alluvium across them at somewhat lower levels . Above these new floodplains , areas of the older alluvium stand as separate and sometimes isolated plains . Many of them are bluffbordered , tabular in form , and have surfaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are poorly drained . Some have also in their surface layers a considerable admixture of volcanic ash and loess , the accumulation of a long period of time . 414 . IMPORTANT PLAINS OF OLDER ALLUVIUM . There are many small plains of older alluvium . In Japan old delta fans , uplifted relative to sea level since their formation , are now dissected by streams and stand as islands of older alluvium in the newer plains or as terraces between the newer plains and the mountain slopes . Because of their greater age and exposure to leaching , under heavy rainfall , the small plains of older alluvium have red soils of greater maturity and lower fertility than those of the plains of new alluvium . Moreover , because of their porous ashy soils and their elevated position , they have excessive drainage , and it is difficult to get irrigation water to them for the cultivation of rice . Consequently the manner of their agricultural utilization is entirely different from that of the newer floodplains and delta fans . Some plains of older alluvium are of vastly greater size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern India the broad structural depression of the middle and upper Ganges and Indus valleys is filled to great depth with older alluvium . Into its surface the present streams that drain the Himalaya mountain front have cut new valleys as a result of an increase of elevation with respect to sea level . There they have constructed floodplains of new alluvium . The interstream areas , there called doabs , are tabular or mesalike remnants of an ancient alluvial plain . Some of these are of large area , but generally they are less productive agriculturally than the present  | floodplains . A similar situation is found south of the Alps . Deep accumulations of older alluvium are there spread out upon the northern flank of the Po Plain and , subsequent to their deposition , have been deeply trenched and terraced by the present Alpine tributaries of the Po . The higher and coarser parts of the older alluvium , called alta pianura , are partially iron cemented and have infertile soils . Southward they grade into the recent and more fertile alluvium of the Po and its tributaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clays , sands , and marls reaching commonly to a depth of 2,000 ft. or more.l These are believed to be the alluvial deposits of streams flowing from the Andes upon a gradually subsiding plain . The surface layers over much of this vast and very flat plain have also a large admixture of loess . Because of their low rainfall , low elevation , and almost imperceptible slope these plains are Figure neither much leached nor deeply eroded . Subhumid climate also has produced a dominant natural vegetation of grass which has added a large component of humus to a soil high in the mineral elements of plant food . The result has been the formation of a flat stoneless plain , highly tillable and of great fertility ( Fig. 175 ) . In the United States almost the entire eastern front of the Rocky Mountains is bordered by plains of older alluvium . These were deposited as a piedmont alluvial plain by the shifting courses of former streams which flowed from the mountains . They are composed of clays , sands , and gravels so generally permeated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistant rocks . The original surface of this vast plain , which extends from the Llano Estacado ( Staked Plains ) of Texas northward to Montana , probably was very flat at the time of its formation . Some areas such as the Staked Plains remain as flat as the Argentine Pampa , but that is not true of the larger part and especially the northern part . Changed conditions have 1 Stappenbeck , R. " Geologie and Grundwasserkunde der Pampa . " Erwin Niigele , Stuttgart , 1946.  | led to the erosion of the plain by the same drainage that formed it . All the streams that traverse the Great Plains have cut new valleys which , by their common direction , have dissected the older alluvium into striplike interfluves with a west-to-east trend . In the process of eroding their present courses some of the streams have cut steep-walled valleys several scores of feet in depth and have built new floodplains from one to several ' miles in width . The margins of these valleys are in many areas much gullied ( 383 ) , but the interfluves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion , as was noted above , are broad and very flat ; but those of the north are more rolling ; and the present surfaces are not those of stream deposition but result from erosion . The soils of these upland surfaces are developed under semiarid climate , are unleached , and are highly productive where they can be irrigated . In general , however , the region is crossed by bands of irrigated crops on the new alluvial bottoms of the major streams while the interfluves of older alluvium are devoted to dry-land crops or to grazing ( Fig. 165 ) .  | 415 . CLASSES OF GLACIATED PLAINS . In northern North America and northwestern Europe are extensive glaciated plains ( 360 ) . Their original surfaces were developed by stream erosion on both complex crystalline rocks and those of simple sedimentary structure . Although the larger relief features of these plains were produced by tectonic forces or by stream erosion , most of the details of landform that characterize their present appearance are the result of glacial action . Therefore , while these great plains already were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensively remodeled by the work of ice . All phases of glacial activity were involved , and their imprints are left upon the plains . In many localities there may be found in close association , and in great variety of detail , the forms produced by glacial erosion , glacial deposition , and deposition by the waters that flowed from the melting ice . It is recognized , however , that within the regions of continental glaciation some areas have predominantly the kinds of surface features that result from glacial erosion while in others the features are mainly those that result from glacial or glaciofluviatile deposition . Plains thus distinguished may be called ice-scoured plains and drift plains respectively . It may be observed in this connection that plains of the ice-scoured type are most prevalent in regions of crystalline rocks and that they are on the inner rather than on the marginal portions of the glaciated areas ( Figs. 134 and 197 ) . There the thin regolith and the general resistance of the rocks provided relatively small amounts of local glacial drift . That which was formed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and these remain as coarse boulders intermingled with some quantities of finer material . The plains of deep glacial drift are found more commonly in association with regions of sedimentary rocks , which generally were more deeply eroded and more easily crushed than those of the crystalline areas . It may be noted also that , in both North America and Europe , the direction of ice motion was generally away from the  | regions of crystalline rock toward those of sedimentary formation and that , therefore , the products of ice erosion in the crystalline areas were deposited elsewhere . That is the reason for the numerous erratic boulders of igneous or metamorphic rock found in drift plains which are underlain by sedimentary rock only ( 362 ) . The features of the two classes of glaciated plains may be discussed separately . The Features of Ice-scoured Plains 416 . THE IcE-scouRED SURFACE . The stream-eroded hills and valleys that previously existed on the plains over which the great con-Figure tinental ice sheets crept probably were not completely erased by glacial scour in most instances , unless they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reshaped by an ice sheet thick enough to bury them deeply beneath its overpowering weight . A first ice invasion of a region doubtless was sufficient to remove the mantle of soil and weathered rock which had accumulated there under previous conditions . Angular profiles , where such had been developed by the usual processes of weathering and stream erosion in rocks of unequal hardness , were then subdued by glacial erosion . The surface configuration of plains where ice scour was predominant is characterized by rounded rock hills and broad open valleys with comparatively low local relief . Over the valley floors a thin veneer of glacial debris may serve inadequately as the parent material of a soil . Strewn with subangular boulders ( 361 ) torn from the adjacent slopes  |  by the ice , the drift of ice-scoured plains commonly is neither deep enough nor continuous enough to be tillable except in patches or localities . It may , however , serve as anchorage for stands of forest , especially the shallow-rooted conifers . Through the veneer of drift , which sometimes barely covers the lowlands of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rock hills still less completely covered ( Fig. 176 ) . Many of these rock hills are entirely without soil covering , except the small quantities of earth lodged in joint cracks and other pockets . Such surfaces , scoured and polished by ice erosion , often bear the grooves and striations scratched upon them by ice-pushed pebbles . In some localities groups of small ice-Figure - scoured hillocks protrude so thickly from the grasscovered drift that they appear from a distance like sheep at rest . They are called roches moutonnees . Some larger hills of the same origin have striking inequalities of slope ( Fig. 177 ) . A long and gradual incline marks the side up which the ice pushed its slow and grinding way , and the lee slope is left shorter and steeper as a result of the quarrying or plucking action of the ice as it pulled away jointed blocks of rock in its forward motion . The name is applied to them also . 417 . DRAINAGE FORMS IN ICE-SCOURED PLAINS . The changes in relief produced by ice scour are not of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other agents , but they are sufficient to disarrange completely the preexisting drainage . It may be supposed that , during the long period of preglacial erosion , streams had become somewhat adjusted to the characters and structures of the rocks of the plains and that they had developed definite patterns as the result of that adjustment . The present drainage of the ice-scoured plains is noted particularly for its indefinite pattern and its lack of adjustment to rock structures . The universal effect of the accident , of glaciation is to return the drainage of a region to a stage of youth in which it is characterized by numerous lakes , waterfalls , and rapids . Lakes are particularly numerous in plains of severe ice scour ( Fig. 178 ) . Many of them lie in rock basins eroded by the ice with its characteristic disregard for uniform gradient . Such basins often are  | broad , only moderately deep , and are dotted with islands which are ice-scoured rock hills of the irregular plain . Glacial lakes of the rockbasin type are likely to be enduring as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to quick destruction than are lakes of some other origins . ( a ) Streams that flow into rock-basin lakes flow over ice-scoured regions , mainly in rock channels , and have little sediment to spread over the lake floors or with which to build Figure deltas . ( b ) The outflowing streams are clear and , therefore , unable quickly to erode notches in the hard rock rims and thus lower the lake levels . ( c ) Ice-scoured regions are in large part unsuited to agriculture and generally remain in forests , whose littered spongy floors tend to prevent rapid runoff and thus to keep the ground-water table high and lakes at uniform levels . Some small rock-basin lakes show almost no tendency to destruction even after the vast lapse of time since the disappearance of the last ice sheet . On the other hand , there are some I hat were shallow by origin and have been filled subsequently by the  | remains of marsh vegetation such as sphagnum moss . In Canada bogs of that type are called muskeg . The same disregard for uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave rock ledges or other abrupt changes of slope to be discovered by the drainage of ice-scoured plains . Streams in such regions found their courses by overflow from basin to basin after the ice was gone , and the wandering patterns of their arrangement are in consequence of the slope as it was left by the ice . On such ungraded courses falls and rapids are numerous , and in Figure regions of hard rock they are , like the lakes , enduring ( Fig. 299 ) . Moreover , the utility of the streams of ice-scoured plains for waterpower development is high compared with that of streams in plains of other kinds . The streams are relatively free of silt ; the falls , though seldom great , are numerous and widely distributed ; and the discharge of water over them is much regulated by the presence of many natural lakes and swamps and by the floors of widespread forests in the drainage areas . 418 . EXTENSIVE ICE-SCOURED PLAINS . The most extensive ice-scoured plains of the world are found close to the centers from which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Fig. 134A , B ) .  | These regions are ( a ) the Laurentian upland plain of Canada and ( b ) the plains of Sweden and Finland . The fact that the preglacial surface in each of these regions was a peneplain of ancient crystalline rocks instead of less resistant sedimentary rocks probably had much to do with the cleanness of ice scour and the preservation of the ice-eroded forms . The time that has elapsed since glaciation , although it is tens of thousands of years , has not been sufficient for slow weathering under high-latitude climate to produce any great change in the ice-carved forms of the hard rocks ( Figs. 197 , 198 ) . A general view over either of the regions named shows an irregularly rolling plain , covered in large part by coniferous forest . Much of the forest , especially on the interstream ridges , is thin and poor , and knobs or patches of bare rock outcrop at frequent intervals . Better forest and patches of tillable soil in the depressions indicate some accumulation of drift . Areas of swamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupy rock and drift basins too shallow to contain lakes . Among the woodlands lie thousands of rock-rimmed lakes , most of them small . but some large and dotted with islands ( Fig. 179 ) . Connecting the lakes are streams with queer sprawling patterns , their tributaries meeting at strange angles , and their placid reaches frequently interrupted by the white water of foaming rapids . Examination of reasonably detailed maps of Finland or of the district lying north and west of Lake Superior will reveal the remarkable development of lakes in those regions and the other peculiarities of drainage in ice-scoured plains ( Fig. 178 ) . According to Blanchard and Visher , there are more than 35,000 lakes in Finland , and they occupy more than 11 per cent of the area of the country . Certain sections of the Superior Highland are more than 25 per cent lake area , but that is not true of the ice-scoured region as a whole . The Features of Drift Plains 419 . THE GENERAL RELATIONSnIPS OF DRIFT PLAINS . The drift plains of the principal regions of continental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance than are the ice-scoured plains . They occupy most of the broad outer margins of the glaciated regions in both North America and Europe , and over them are spread the debris carried from the ice-scoured plains intermingled with a much larger quantity obtained locally or transported only a short distance . Their features are the products of both ice scour and the deposition of drift . The drift is of variable thickness . In places it is deep , as in the valleys that existed before glaciation , but it may be thin or almost absent upon the tops of some adjacent ice-rounded rock hills . In some localities drift completely buries the rock surface under an unbroken mantle which may be several tens of feet or even 400 or 500 ft. in thickness . The surface features of the drift are relatively independent  | of those of the underlying rock . Drift commonly is deep in the bottoms of buried preglacial valleys and thinner over the tops of adjacent rock hills , although the reverse is sometimes true . In general the effects of continental glaciation upon relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which deposition was the dominant activity . This was brought about by more severe erosion of the stream-cut rock hills of the preglacial surface than of the valley bottoms and by a greater deposition of drift in the valley bottoms than on the hilltops ( Fig. 180A ) . In some localities , however , rough moraine deposited upon a smooth rock surface had the opposite effect ( Fig. 180C ) . Figure 420 . GENERAL FEATURES OF DRIFT PLAINS . It has been noted previously that glacial drift is comprised of several classes of deposits , some of which are put down underneath the body of the ice itself whereas others are associated with its margins or with the streams of melt water flowing from the ice ( 363 ) . Because of this fact the typical drift plain has various classes of features arranged in diverse but recognizable patterns . The most extensive and fundamental element in this complex is the till sheet or ground moraine , an undulating surface which covers most of the area once occupied by the glacier . About the margins of the till sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varying amounts of the other classes of deposits . Ridgelike marginal moraines ( end or recessional ) often are arranged in broad festoons , one behind another ( Figs. 181 , 189 ) . Bordering them , either beyond the till sheet or upon its surface , are areas of stream-sorted and  | deposited sand and gravels or beds of fine sand and clay which accumulated in temporary lakes . Each major class of drift is characterized by distinctive features of surface configuration and differences in composition which have both advantages and disadvantages for human occupance and use . They may now be presented for more detailed consideration under the following headings : ( a ) till plains ; ( b ) marginal moraines ; ( c ) glaciofluvial plains , and ( d ) glaciolacustrine plains. 421 . TIIn TILL PLAIN ( 362 ) is a mantle of unstratified drift deposited underneath the glacial ice . It is a widely distributed surface Figure deposit and is the foundation upon which other forms of drift rest in many localities . In it arc rock materials of all degrees of size from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glaciers , down to the finest of clay or rock flour ( Fig. 182 ) . These ingredients are thoroughly mingled and show no separation into strata of different size or weight classes such as are deposited by running water . The till generally is comprised of materials which largely are of local origin . In regions of sandstone bedrock it has commonly a large component of sand , and in shale regions a large component of clay . Usually , however , there are foreign materials present also . Some are fine materials such as sand , clay , and pulverized limestone brought from regions of different kinds of rock . Others , called erratics , are pebbles and boulders of harder sedi-  | mentary rocks or of igneous or metamorphic rocks which have been transported scores or even hundreds of miles from their nearest known sources . Such rocks often are conspicuous because of their large size or their hard and unweathered condition . Many of them are subangular in shape and show scratches and other evidence of having Figure been reduced in size by scraping and grinding against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 183 ) . In regions of resistant bedrock especially , boulders of local origin may be so numerous in the till as seriously to interfere with the cultivation of the soil . Such is the ease , for example , in New England , where the till sheet is thin and Figure the surface features are about as much the result of ice scour as of the deposition of drift . Unlike the normal weathered regolith ( Fig. 112 ) , which grades downward into the underlying bedrock from which it is derived , the till sheet is similar in composition from top to bottom , however deep it may be . Moreover , it ends abruptly and rests upon  | the hard and little weathered surface of the ice-scoured bedrock beneath . 422 . THE SURFACE FEATURES OF THE YOUNG TILL PLAIN . The relief features of the till surface generally are of a minor order of size . The principal and widespread characteristic is a gently undulating surface which includes broad low hills , or swells , and wide shallow Figure depressions , or swales , the latter often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unequal deposition of the ground moraine . The various elevations and depressions are arranged according to no recognizable pattern , and commonly the local relief is less than 100 ft . Exceptions to this condition are found in areas that had a consider-Figure able preglacial relief . There the principal hills are rock-cored and are but thinly veneered protrusions of a rock surface having a relief too great to be completely buried by the till sheet ( Figs. 180B , 185 ) . In a few localities only are there hills of considerable height which are composed entirely of the glacial till . The exact manner of formalion of tliege peculiar hills is not known , but commonly they are half-  | Figure Figure  | egg-shaped , their higher and steeper ends facing in the direction from which the ice came ( the reverse of the roches moutonnees , 416 ) . They are called drumlins ( Fig. 186 ) . Some of them reach heights of 100 ft. or more and may be a mile long , but many are smaller . Where conditions under the ice were favorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable to the formation of others , for commonly they are found in groups that occupy many square miles ( Fig. 187 ) . The individual drumlins of a group are separated by the undulating surface of the till plain , from which they rise somewhat abruptly . Figure 423 . DRAINAGE FORMS AND DRAINAGE PATTERNS IN YOUNG TILL PLAINS . The drainage condition of till plains of recent glaciation must be described as generally poor . The uneven and patternless dumping of the till is reflected in the ill-developed pattern of the streams which , in consequence of the slope of a surface of swells and swales , spilled from one depression into the next after the disappearance of the glacier ( Fig. 188 ) . These streams , like those of the icescoured plains , are youthful . Their courses are interrupted by swamps , lakes , falls , and rapids . In regions of deep till the falls and rapids were soon eroded out of the soft material and are not now numerous . Indeed , some small streams flowing through the unconsolidated till have quickly acquired graded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maturity . In many till plains , however , the downward cutting of a stream in the glac ; al drift has discovered  | here and there a buried ridge of the preglacial rock surface and has developed falls or rapids of greater permanence having economic value as water-power sites . The numerous lakes and far more numerous swamps of the till plain lie mainly in depressions due in part to ice scour and in part to the unequal deposition of the drift . The depressions , or basins , thus formed are of two somewhat different kinds . ( a ) Some are due to the erosional reshaping , unequal filling , and morainic blocking of preglacial river valleys . Some of the lakes formed in such basins are large , deep , and permanent . The Great Lakes of North America lie in basins that are mainly glacial modifications of preglacial river valleys . Ice scour enlarged these valleys , and morainic dams blocked them , although a gentle crustal warping has also been involved in their formation . Owing to successive drift dams across a single preglacial valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as does the series of four near Madison , Wis. ( b ) Other basins are the impressions of large ice blocks which became detached from the margin of a stagnant glacier as a result of melting along crevasses . Basins of these origins may be many square miles in area , or they may be mere ponds , but , whether large or small , they are likely to be shallow . Lakes in the smaller morainic basins are maintained by direct rainfall , by springs about their borders , or by inflowing brooks from limited drainage areas . The permanency of the numerous small lakes of the till plain is not great . Infiowing drainage is abundantly supplied with silt and tends to fill a basin quickly . Outfiowing drainage is able quickly to cut a notch in the soft morainic rim , lowering the outlet and with it the lake level . Such as are maintained by rain and springs and drain wholly by seepage through the drift depend for their existence upon the position of the ground-water table . In the till plains of America , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , thousands of lake-filled basins left at the retreat of the last glacier had been filled or drained by natural processes , including the growth of vegetation , and converted into marshes . Generally the basins are partly filled with peat , the acid half-decayed remains of rank vegetative growths . Some are now covered with grasses and appear as marsh meadows . During the last century other thousands of small lakes and ponds iu America have dwindled in size or have become marshes , owing to thin increased rate of fill resulting from clearing and plowing on adjacent hillsides or to the lowering of the ground-water table which folly ws general deforestation . Likewise , thousands of acres of small marslilauid.s have been artificially drained , and their surfaces put to agricultural or pastoral uses .  | 424 . MARGINAL MORAINES AND THEIR ARRANGEMENT . A period of balance between the rate of glacial advance and the rate of melting permitted the position of the ice margin to remain stationary or to change but slightly . During such a time the moving ice continued to drag forward in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its surface , quantities of drift all of which were deposited about its relatively stationary margin as a marginal moraine ( 363 , Fig. 181 ) . Thus were created ridges or belts of drift of greater thickness than the till sheet and with notably different detail of form and pattern of arrangement . Periods of temporary marginal halt occurred ( a ) at the place of its greatest advance , during the time of hesitation between general advance and excessive wastage ; and ( b ) at intervals during the long time required for the slow and complete wastage or melting back of the glacier . Moraines put down about the margin of the ice at its most advanced position are called end moraines . Tecessional moraines were built upon the top of the till plain at places of hesitation or temporary readvance during glacial wastage . It appears to have been a general condition of glacial disappearance that atmospheric temperature , the supply of snow , or other elements of environment caused the rate of waste to be most irregular . Advances , or slight readvances , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with periods of waste so rapid that only small amounts of marginal deposit were put down upon the surface of the till . This is indicated by successive morainal ridges separated by areas of till plain . The patterns of arrangement of marginal moraines greatly affect the appearance and use of regions in which they occur , and also they may be used to indicate the extent of the area covered during the period of greatest glacial advance or at any stage ( luring its retreat . It is certain that all parts of a long ice front of from 1,000 to 2,000 miles neither advanced nor wasted away as a unit but did so unequally as a series of lobes or tongues separated by embayments . Evidence of that is found in the pattern of arrangement of the principal end moraines and other marginal moraines left by the last continental glacier of North America . They form a series of intersecting arcs or of interlacing and irregular scallops ( Fig. 189 ) . 425 . THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF MARGINAL MORAINES . Marginal morainal ridgesavary greatly as to size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly noticeable ; others are single narrow ridges a few yards in width and only a few feet high . However , some are comprised of belts rather than ridges of drift and have rough or strongly undulating surfaces which are pitted with steep-sided depressions.  | These belts commonly are from 1 to 5 miles in width , many miles long , and contain hills which reach elevations of 100 to 200 ft. higher than that of the bordering till plain . Such moraines clearly were not deposited by the ice while its margin remained unmoving . They are Figure compound ridges resulting from deposition during a period of many minor changes of position . The drift that makes up marginal moraines includes both unstratified and stratified forms . Much of the material , having been pushed forward into its present position by an advancing ice edge , is boulder clay , like that of the till plain . Other parts , and especially the surface  | materials , were deposited with the partial aid of waters flowing from the melting ice and issuing from channels on the ice or under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to remove the clay and other finer materials and transport them out beyond the marginal moraine . That tended to leave the surface of the morainal ridge much more gravelly and with a higher proportion of large boulders than characterizes the till plain . Even in regions where the adjacent till has not many boulders marginal moraines may be so stony as to interfere with their cultivation . Figure 426 . THE SURFACE FEATURES OF LARGE MARGINAL MORAINES . The rough and knobby surface peculiar to belts of marginal moraine sometimes is called kame-and-kettle moraine ( Fig. 190 ) . Kames are rounded or irregular hills , sometimes even ridges , of imperfectly stratified glacial gravel . It is believed that they are mainly the conelike or deltalike deposits of streams from the ice front . Being formed of gravelly drift against the ice front , many of them slumped backward upon the withdrawal of the ice , leaving mounds of rounded shape and disturbed strata clotting the morainic surface . Kettles are steep-sided hollows , often quite round , in the drift . They are particularly abundant in marginal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like many of the lake basins of the till plain , through the separation of large blocks of ice from the glacier edge and their existence there until the glacier was so far withdrawn that the surface depressions caused by their melting could not be filled with other deposits .  | Not only is the surface of the typical marginal moraine rough and stony , but it is dotted with lakes and ponds which lie in the kettle holes . Lakes of this kind vary from small round ponds to some of considerable size ( Fig. 191 ) . Many of them have neither visible inlet nor apparent outlet . They are maintained by surface drainage and by springs in the glacial deposits and are prevented from overflowing by outward seepage through the gravels of the morainic ridge . Pleasantly irregular surfaces , numerous lakes , and scattered woodlands , left by farmers on steep or stony surfaces , cause belts of marginal moraine to be sought as playgrounds by the inhabitants of adjacent flatter plains. 427 . GLACIOFLuVIAL PLAINS . Drainage from a long ice front was discharged through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were overloaded , and , escaping from the confines of narrow Figure crevasses or subglacial tunnels , their velocities were checked immediately beyond the marginal moraines . There they built glaciofluvial deposits which have features somewhat like those of floodplains or alluvial fans ( 363 ) . Some marginal moraines are fringed for miles with outwash plains of water-sorted and therefore stratified drift which was washed out from . the ice front ( Figs. 181A , 192 ) . These are characterized by flat surfaces and an internal structure of rudely stratified sand , gravels , and small boulders ( Fig. 193 ) . In general , the clay component of the drift is not present in the deposits because it was carried farther on by the streams that built them . The largest boulders , on the other hand , usually were left behind on the moraines . Outwash plains are of frequent occurrence in association with end and other marginal moraines . The generally flat surfaces of some outwash plains that are underlain by till are dotted with kettle holes which appear to have resulted from the melting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glacial wastage ( Figs. 181 , 194 ) . Plains of that kind are called pitted outwash . They are common among the extensive  | outwash plains of southern Michigan ( Fig. 189 ) . During spring thaws , when the soil still is frozen , the kettles are likely to contain small ponds , but they are not commonly occupied by permanent lakes because of the free drainage of surface waters through the underlying gravels . Figure Because of the materials of which outwash plains are composed they commonly are of rather low agricultural productivity as compared with till plains . Even though their surfaces are very flat , they are in some Figure places stony and in others sandy , and usually they are subject to drought because of the free underdrainage . They are , however , provided with naturally crushed and rudely sorted sands and gravels for constructional use , and the supply is abundant since some of the  | outwash deposits are many feet thick ( Fig. 195 ) . The large commercial gravel pits of the Great Lakes region mainly are located in outwash plains. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glacier margin in some places was spread fanwise upon outwash plains but in others was Figure confined within definite channels . Some such were within the ice ; others were beyond its margin . The streams leading away from the fronts of some glacial ice lobes seem to have been heavily burdened , since their channels now are floored with glaciofluvial deposits for many miles beyond the former ice margin . These aggraded glacial stream beds are called valley trains , and Figure they bear the same relationship to outwash plains that floodplains bear to piedmont alluvial plains . Valley-train gravels and sands now are found in the floodplains or alluvial terraces ( 406 ) of the Mississippi , lower Wisconsin . and other streams the channels of which led away from the front of the great North American glacier ( Fig. 189 ) .  | The temporary streams that discharged from the glacier margin flowed from the ice sometimes at the bottoms of deep crevasses in the ice and sometimes in ice tunnels ( Fig. 181 ) . Being heavily loaded , they aggraded their beds and built narrow deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the stagnant ice melted away without sufficient forward motion to erase so fragile a feature , it clearly would remain to mark the course of the ancient stream . Such deposits are not uncommon and are called ethers . They appear as sinuous ridges of gravel somewhat like an abandoned railroad grade . Some of them continue , with interruptions , for many miles ( Fig. 196 ) . They also are potential sources of gravel for use in construction . 429 . THE DRIFT PLAINS OF AMERICA AND EUROPE . Those parts of glaciated North America and Europe in which the features made by glacial deposition predominate over those that result from ice scour Figure are roughly indicated in Figs. 197 and 198 . Not only are the drift plains extensive , but they include a large part of the most populous and highly developed sections of those continents . Also , by reason of the strong contrasts possible in the surface forms , composition , and drainage of drift , they contain localities of very different appearance and utility . There are poor areas , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Germany . There are productive areas , such as the plains of eastern England or those of western Ohio . Each of the regions of continental glaciation has its areas of lakedotted marginal moraine and its areas of till plain with drumlins , marshes , and undulating cultivable lands . However , in the drift plains of both continents are some contrasts which can not be explained in terms of local variation of glacial action or of underlying rock . 430 . NEw DRIFT PLAINS AND OLD . The characteristic features of drift . plains , as they were described above , are mainly those of glacial Figure  | deposits so recent that they have been little altered by weathering and erosion since their deposition . There are associated with them , in both North America and Europe , extensive plains which bear unmistakable evidence of being ice deposited but which clearly are much older ( 365 ) . The gradational processes have been so long at work upon them that they have reduced some of the irregularities and created new ones . Morainal ridges have been subdued , kames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled , so that the number and irregularity of these features are much less than in the newer drift . Erratic boulders Figure have been weathered until many of them crumble into earth , and gravel deposits have been disintegrated or buried beneath later alluvium or deposits of loess ( 445 ) . The result of these changes has been to produce more gently undulating plains , better drained and with finer and more uniform drift . On the other hand , the greater age of this drift has permitted erosional features to develop which locally increase the irregularity of the surface . The aimless pattern of the drainage characteristic of new drift has been reformed and approaches the dendritic pattern of stream-eroded plains . Stream valleys have been cut through the drift into underlying rock . In places the drift is largely removed and becomes thin or patchy , so that the surface features are not greatly different in appearance from those of the driftless plains  | beyond the margin of former glaciation . Even marginal moraines are so changed that the former positions of some of them may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent of the new and older drift sheets of America and Europe are indicated in Figs. 197 and 198. 431 . THE OLDER DRIFT SUBDIVIDED . In the older drift itself students of glaciology recognize drift horizons of several distinct ages . These are Figure separated by layers of plant remains and other evidences of great lapse of time . While the latest of them is far older than the newer drift , it may be noted that even the oldest of them is much younger than the sedimentary  | rocks upon which they rest . This can lead only to the conclusion that , however many thousands of years it may be since the disappearance of the last ice sheet , it is many times that number since the coming of the first one . Also , that the " ice age , " including all the several periods of glacial advance and wastage with intervals between them , is but a relatively recent event in earth history ( see Appendix E ) . 432 . GLACIAL LAKES AND LAKE PLAINS . It has been shown how glacial lakes have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land by filling or by draining through natural processes or human intervention . Thousands of small flats of that kind are found among the farm lands of drift plains . Somewhat different in kind , and of immensely greater size , are a few plains resulting from the existence of former great lakes now diminished in area or completely disappeared . It has been observed that the lakes of the drift plains are due to some kind of glacial obstruction of present drainage . This is in some degree true even of the Great Lakes . However , in an earlier stage in their history the drainage of the Great Lakes , and of several other large lakes which have now disappeared , was obstructed by the ice of the glacier itself . Where the ice front arested upon a surface that sloped down toward the glacier it furnished drainage that could not escape and , therefore , was impounded in a lake that had the ice front as one margin . The lake rose until it found an outlet at the lowest point on its rim ( Fig. 199 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as marginal lakes . The final wastage of the ice barrier back of a marginal lake removed the obstruction that caused it . The drainage sought a new and lower outlet , and the lake dwindled in size or disappeared entirely . During the periods of their existence marginal lakes modified the land surfaces that they covered and in their disappearance left behind unmistakable features which are called lake plains or iueuslri.ne plains . Their distinguishing features are level surfaces which are  | comprised largely of the wave-worked ingredients of the drift ; silts and clays where they were abundant ; but sometimes sand also ( Fig. 200 ) . Plains of this origin have a flatness similar to that of newly emerged marine plains . There are few extensive plains more level than these ( Fig. 2O1 ) . They include also shore features such as beach ridges , offshore bars , and deltas that are comprised largely of glacial sands and gravels . These features are spread at intervals that mark successive stages in the lowering of the outlet and the decrease of the lake area . Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as parts of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan , had surfaces too rough to be completely submerged by the temporary lakes of glacial times . They now contain areas of lake plain interspersed among rocky hills . Many of Figure the latter , during the existence of the enlarged lakes , must have been islands . In places also , stream erosion since glacial time has dissected the lacustrine plains so thoroughly that only remnants of their flat surfaces now are to be seen . 433 . NOTABLE LAcUSTRINE PLAINS . Glacial lake plains are found in Europe , and there are in America several of great extent and unusual economic significance . Notable among these are the lake-plain margins of the present Great Lakes , the Lake Agassiz plain , the southern part of the Ontario Clay Belt , and the sand plain of central Wisconsin . During the wastage of the last ice sheet the southern portions of the Great Lakes were exposed while the great ice dam still lay across the lowest and present outlet through the St. Lawrence Valley . Drainage from the ice front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlets . This caused the formation of lakes of larger area than  | those of the present . The bottoms of those more extensive lakes , containing the unleached glacial silts and clays , are now flat and fertile plains in northern Ohio , eastern Michigan , western New York , and elsewhere ( Figs. 202 , 189 ) . Even the city of Chicago stands in large part upon one of them . They are bordered by a series of beach ridges and other shore features which mark the lake levels at the stages of successive outlets . These slightly elevated ridges were much used as thoroughfares in the days of early settlement because they were well drained . Several are now the sites of important roadways established at that time . Examples of such roads are seen in U. S. Highway 31 west of Rochester , N. Y. , and U. S. 20 both east and west of / Cleveland , Ohio . In the same manner glacial drainage was impounded in a large marginal lake between the wasting ice front in central Canada and the higher land of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow lake creglaciolacustrine plains and Oa- ated upon this slope found for a long time vial spillways of North its lowest outlet through the course of the America . present Minnesota River into the Mississippi . The wave-worked sediments that were spread over the floor of that formerly extensive body of water , which is known as Lake Agassiz , now comprise the flat and fertile Red River Plains . Lakes Winnipeg and Winnipegosis now occupy the lowest portions of the depression , the remainder of the lake having disappeared when the ice dam was removed . Upon the ice-scoured surface of the Laurentian Shield where morainic deposits generally are scant , coarse , and infertile is a region known as the Ontario Clay Belt . It is a district of growing agricultural value and is comprised in part of sediments laid down in a marginal lake . So also is the plain of central Wisconsin , but in this instance both the drift from which the sediments were derived and the lake bed upon which they were deposited were composed largely of sandstones .

It would be strange if streams of sufficient size to carry so much water had not left their marks upon the landscape . The principal marks are ancient spillways . These are broad valleys eroded in the drift or in rock beds where ice-front or marginal-lake drainage cut across low divides into established rivers leading to the sea ( Fig. 203 ) . Many such spillways are known , both in  | America and ' in Europe . Several of them are now occupied by streams that seem ridiculously small in valleys that appear to have been eroded by streams of the size of the Mississippi . Figure 202 shows the location and drainage relationships of the principal American spillways . It will be recognized at once that some of them are of unusual significance as routes of present-day transportation .

It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the operation of the same tectonic and gradational processes that have been considered in connection with the features of other plains . However , the features of arid plains do not look like those of plains in humid regions , because the work of the gradational agents under arid climate is sufficiently different so that many distinctive features are produced . The outstanding differences between the features of arid-land relief and those of humid regions may be attributed largely to the following : ( a ) the much slower rate of weathering in arid regions than is found under humid conditions ; ( b ) the meagerness of the vegetative cover of desert , surfaces , with resultant lack of protection against erosion ; ( c ) the intermittent but typically rapid runoff of desert streams ; ( d ) the peculiar and highly selective nature of desert-stream erosion ; ( e ) the prevalence of basins of interior drainage ; and ( f ) the widespread occurrence of features that result from wind erosion or wind deposition . So general is the distribution of the latter that arid plains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FROM THE SLOWNESS OF DESERT WEATHERING . Both chemical and mechanical weathering act upon the rocks of desert regions , but owing to infrequent precipitation and low atmospheric humidity they act slowly . The rate of erosion is rapid by comparison , since both wind and flood waters are active eroding agents . The slowness of weathering and the comparative activity cf erosion result in the exposure of unweathered rock features in bold outlines and sharp details which , in humid climates , would be softened in contour by rock decomposition or by burial underneath an accumulation of weathered debris . For that reason , and because there is so little vegetation to conceal them , fault scarps , the eroded edges of  | sedimentary strata , or stream-eroded bluffs commonly stand out prominently upon the desert plain . Even small features fail to lose , in spite of long exposure , that angularity of profile and freshness of detail that make them appear to be of recent origin ( Fig. 205 ) . 437 . FEATURES RESULTING FROM THE PECULIARITIES OF DESERTSTREAM EROSION . In humid plains the streams that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through springs and seepage flow steadily and cut valleys the forms and patterns Figure of which have become familiar . In arid regions most streams are intermittent , but occasionally they flow in great volume as a result of the fall of torrential rain upon the bare surface of earth , which is parched and incapable of absorbing moisture rapidly . Under these conditions , according to Johnson , ' the intermittent streams have a tendency to acquire a load quickly by downward erosion at their headwaters in the bordering highlands while in their middle courses on the plains they tend to choke their own channels , build sand bars , and subdivide Footnote  | into many shallow , braided channels in which occasional torrents of water spread and shift from side to side . Instead of cutting greatly downward in their middle courses desert streams tend therefore to swing laterally , undercut the edges of bordering elevations , and plane them off , leaving the eroded surfaces covered only by a veneer of alluvium . It is a kind of erosion that is not widely developed in humid regions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formation of smooth rock floors , usually covered by veneers of gravel . Such plains often are found about the bases of desert mountains , from which they incline outward at low angles , bordered on the one hand by the steeper slopes of mountains and on the other by the gentler slopes of alluvial deposits . They have been called pediments . Although the Figure construction of a pediment appears to begin in the graded middle course of the stream valleys , the process creeps headward as the valleys get older . Lateral erosion gnaws at the foothills and ultimately extends into the shrinking mountain mass itself . Finally the highland may be eroded entirely away during the progress of the cycle of erosion . ' The pediment is , therefore , a type of rocky plain peculiar to the desert , and examples of it are known in most arid plains . They are abundantly developed about the mountain ranges of the North American desert ( Fig. 206 ) . In the Sahara are broad expanses of rocky desert plain , some of which are from 100 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed to be parts of ancient peneplains which perhaps are the remnants of still more ancient highlands baseleveled by desert erosion . If this is true , then they are fully developed pediments which have been slightly elevated in more recent geological time , stripped of their alluvial veneers by the work of wind and water , and gashed by sleep-Footnote  | sided stream channels , now dry . ' Having little soil , these rocky plains have little even of desert vegetation , and they are the most completely desert of all arid plains . In northern Africa they are called hamada , and the term may well be applied to similar rock plains in other deserts . The effect of sidewise erosion of the dry-land type in regions of horizontal sedimentary strata is seen also in flattish surfaces that are not necessarily baseleveled . By lateral cutting , less resistant formations are stripped away down to the surface of a more resistant stratum the surface of which then practically coincides with the surface of the plain . Such plains are called stripped plains . The effect of lateral cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in arid plains . Where valleys of considerable size have been cut in desert plains they commonly are steep-sided and flat-bottomed and clearly are being widened by undercutting of the valley walls ( Fig. 205 ) . The result is the dissection of the upland into flat-topped , or tabular , blocks which are separated by flat-bottomed valleys . The slopes between upland and lowland are steep , and lateral erosion , coupled with a slow rate of weathering , tends to keep them so . Many desert plains have dry valleys of the flat-bottomed , steepsided form.2 Some of them are utilized as routes of travel because they furnish well-graded paths across otherwise dissected uplands . Upon their bottoms seepage water and soil water stored from the latest rains suffice to support more forage for beasts than may be found upon adjacent uplands . In the dry stream channels natural water holes or the digging of shallow wells may provide drinking water at usable intervals . In some desert valleys there is a sufficient supply of spring or well water in favored spots to provide for a limited irrigation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oasis ( 402 , 409 ) . 438 . ALLUVIAL BASINS OF INTERIOR DRAINAGE . In many arid plains are structural ( tectonic ) basins into which are discharged the drainage waters of the plain and with them great quantities of alluvial filling . In humid lands streams that flow into structural basins fill them with water , creating lakes which overflow the lowest point upon the rim , and the drainage ultimately reaches the oceans . Few streams in arid plains have sufficient volume or permanence to flow to the ocean . Intermittently they flow and sometimes with great volume , only to be swallowed up in the desert floor or to spread in shallow lakes over Figure  | the lowest parts of their basins , where exposure to sun and dry winds soon evaporates them . Flood water , therefore , moves toward the center of the basin , but none flows out . For that reason the desert plain may be said to be typically a region of interior drainage . Only a few streams , those of greatest volume and permanence , and especially those exotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desert , are able to flow across it and reach the sea . Only for the great streams is baselevel determined by sea level . For the others it is determined by the levels of the alluvium-filled basins or temporary lakes into which they flow . THE DRAINAGE OF DESERT BASINS . The basins of desert plains generally are broad and shallow features . Within them lie accumulations of alluvium which aggrade and flatten the basin floors . Upon the flanks of Figure some , especially the smaller and deeper , the filling is collected in the form of encircling alluvial fans . Basins of that type have been called bolsons ? In many of the shallower basins the alluvium is spread uniformly over the gently sloping plain . The lowest portion of the typical basin of interior drainage shows evidence of concentration of drainage there in the form of marshes or lakes . If the general rate of inward drainage is balanced by the average rate of loss through evaporation , a lake is likely to exist . It will be a salt-water lake , because water is continually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inflowing water , especially the common salt , remain behind in solution and eventually reach concentrations that make some salt lakes more salty than the oceans . If the rate of evaporation generally is in excess of the rate of inflow , temporary , or playa , lakes will result from occasional torrential inflows of water . These are followed by periods of excessive evaporation . The marshy beds of these ephemeral lakes Footnote  | commonly are mud covered and are strongly charged with salt or soluble soil alkalies . ' When thoroughly dried they commonly are incrusted with salts and sometimes are glistening white in color ( Fig. 207 ) . In this class of deposits are not only those of common salt and other compounds of sodium and calcium , which are called alkali , but also some of economic value . Among the latter are the borax deposits of southwestern United States and the famous sodium nitrate deposits of northern Chile ( 703 ) . The great salt lakes of the world lie , as may be expected , in basins of internal drainage , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the Aral and Caspian Seas , which are surrounded by the plains of Russian Turkistan ; and Lake Eyre in southern Australia . The latter usually is a dry salt plain and its level is , like that of the Caspian , lower than sea level . Great Salt Lake and several other permanent salt lakes also are situated in basins of interior drainage but at such elevations above sea level that they may be considered in connection with plateaus. 439 . FEATURES RESULTING FROM WIND EROSION . The sparsity of vegetation in arid plains regions gives unusual scope to the erosional activities of the wind ( 206 ) . Some of the minor landforms show abundant evidence of the abrasive effect of wind-blown sand . Wind abrasion aids differential weathering in the production of curiously etched , rounded , or polished details of rock surface , some of them in fantastic shapes . Of much more widespread importance than this minor activity is the general process of deflation ( 370 ) . Dust and sand are removed from all parts of the desert surface but perhaps most abundantly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material is generally finer . This process has the effect of deepening the basins which otherwise tend to be filled by alluvium . It is the only means by which earth may be removed from the desert basin . 440 . DEFLATION and the deposition of the products of deflation result in the formation of a number of significant dry-land features . Upon the margins of desert basins it is less effective in the removal of material because the material there usually is more coarse and rocky . The surfaces of pediments yield little that wind may transport , and the upper margins of fans are made up of the coarser stream-transported materials . Such fine material as exists or is provided by local weathering is quickly removed , leaving behind the fragments that are too heavy for wind removal . These remain until they cover the surface , forming what is called a desert pavement ( Fig. 208 ) . In some regions the pebbles and fragments of the desert pavement are covered by a thin coating of iron oxide and other chemicals which is polished by dust abrasion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain with glistening yellow , brown , red , or even black . In those parts of a Footnote  | desert plain that are deeply covered with alluvium deflation removes the finer surface material leaving a gravelly desert pavement , underneath which is alluvial soil . Because of their deeper soils such areas hold more moisture than the rocky hamada and are likely to have a little more vegetation . Great expanses of flat , pebbly or gravelly , alluvial , desert plains of the kind just described are , in the Sahara Desert , called reg . In the central portions of large desert basins of alluvial filling the deposits are less coarse and more subject to deflation . Dried and crumbled playa muds are unprotected by vegetation and are easily removed . Under intense insolation dancing whirlwinds lift dust high into the air and not only transport it but may even remove much of it entirely from the basin to regions well beyond its borders . It is probable that the total thickness of surface material thus removed from the floor of the desert basin is great enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figure 441 . AEOLIAN SAND PLAINS . From the foregoing it is clear that the popular conception of the arid plain as a sea of wind-blown sand is not well founded . Not many large desert areas are so much as onefourth sand covered . However , there are many regions of sandy desert . The abundant rock grains in them are derived ( a ) from the disintegration of sandstone and other bedrock in the locality where the sand deposits are found or ( b ) from local accumulations of transported fragments separated by wind sorting from both the finer and the coarser products of rock weathering elsewhere . The finer weathered particles , removed as dust , are whirled high into the atmosphere , carried entirely away , and deposited as loess far beyond the limits of the region . The coarser fragments remain behind as components of the desert pavement . The sand , however , is carried in the lower atmosphere , transported to considerable distances , and lodged inn t i t y , ( ilia often in the form of sand ridges or sand dines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind velocities or in some other way to favor the accumulation of sand . 442 . The Features of Sand-ridge and Sand-dune Areas . Sand plains are of some extent in most deserts ( Fig. 313 ) . They cover great areas in Sahara and in parts of central and western Australia . ' In the latter region , under an average of about 10 in. of annual rainfall , the sand hills , according to Madigan , 2 assume a striking form and pattern of arrangement and support a sparse dry-land vegetation . The peculiarity of the Australian sand hills is that they are arranged in parallel ridges which trend with the direction of the locally prevailing trade winds , generally southeast to northwest . The ridges average about 40 ft. high and are separated by long , stony , gravelly , or sandy flats from a few rods to several miles wide . These gigantic " washboard " corrugations are remarkably continuous , single ridges extending almost unbroken for scores or even hundreds of miles . They appear to be wind formed but are not now actively moving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengthwise , sand slowly drifting from their windward ends toward the leeward . In central Nebraska also there is a large sand plain , but it has developed under subhumid climate and prairie vegetation , and its surface is characterized by areas of stagnant grass-covered dunes ( Fig. 310 ) . In the Sahara and other deserts of extreme aridity sand-hill or dune regions of great size and barrenness are encountered ( 371 ) . They are comprised of dunes of fresh sand which are separated by pockets or hollows , some of which are of considerable size . The dunes , both large and small , usually present gentle slopes to the prevailing winds but fall off steeply to the leeward ( Fig. 209 ; see also Fig. 224 ) . High winds drift sand up their gentle windward slopes and over their crests , where the grains drop in the shelter of the leeward slopes . By this process the dune form is created and maintained , and the whole feature is caused to migrate slowly with the prevailing wind , yet the general migration must be very slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years without any significant change in their position being noted . In other regions observations have shown that some dunes move at rates up to 50 or 100 ft. per year . In any case the continuous abrasion of drifting sand , together with the great aridity , is sufficient to prevent vegetation 's making any active growth upon the dune surface . From the top of a conspicuous dune , which may be as much  | as 200 or 300 ft. high , those of smaller size present a view like that of a billowing sea . A large expanse of bare sand dunes and sand flats hundreds of square miles in area in the Sahara is called the erg by the desert inhabitants . 443 . WATER SUPPLIES IN DUNE REGIONS . Some large regions of desert sand dunes are difficult to traverse and have sparse human populations , if any , because of their rough surfaces , scant vegetation , and deficient water supplies . The great Libyan erg of eastern Sahara is reputed to be peculiarly devoid of both water and vegetation . Yet that is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink readily into the porous sand hills , where the water is stored and yielded in favorable sites to springs or wells . In western Sahara some of the notable oases lie in the midst of great dune areas . Some of them are located in series on favored sites along old desert stream channels which have been overrun and largely buried by migrating dunes . In the buried channel sufficient water concentrates by seepage to supply irrigation to restricted basins among the dunes . In these still another class of oasis may be recognized , highly important locally but generally of small size and much less significant than the principal classes previously noted ( 402 , 409 , 437 ) . Even where there is not sufficient water for irrigation , not all dune areas are devoid of vegetation . Within the pockets and basins among the dunes seepage of rainwater is sometimes able to provide the basin floors with  | sufficient moisture for the growth of pasture . Sand-dune grazing areas of that kind are found in the desert regions of all the continents , including those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOESS PLAINS . Some of the considerable plains of the world are loess mantled ( 371 ) . Not all loess deposits are plains , because aeolian ( lust comes to rest upon hill and valley alike and is found in regions of great relief as well as upon lowlands . The thick loess mantle that covers the rough surface of northwestern China has been much eroded also and in places is of extreme irregularity . Elsewhere are loess deposits that , if not so deep as those of China , are of equal or greater area . Some of these are found upon extensive plains , but they are not in themselves the cause of the plains . They merely cover and perhaps increase the levelness of plains due to other physiographic causes . 445 . THE NATURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF LOESS . The dust of which loess is composed is fine , but it is chemically undecomposed . Its character indicates accumulation by wind transportation over distances great enough so that coarse material is not included with it . Its unleached condition indicates also that the material is derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predominant . Such sources are found in , and the loess deposits are believed to have been derived from the deflation of , ( a ) arid lands and ( b ) the bare drift deposits and abundant stream muds which were associated with the retreat of the former continental ice sheets . Loess deposits are deepest and most widely distributed in regions of steppe environment because , generally , those regions border the deserts , and because there the soil is sufficiently moist to support a grass cover so that the loess , once deposited , is not easily removed again by the wind . In central United States and central Europe the principal loess deposits are believed to have been derived , at least in large part , from the muds of the fresh drift and the drainage ways associated with the wastage of the former continental glaciers . Loess of that origin is found well beyond the borders of the steppe regions and even to some extent in regions of humid climate and forest vegetation . The internal structure of loess is unstratified , highly porous , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existence of former plant roots . Owing to its structure it has the property of standing in vertical faces when cut through by streams or roadways , even though the material is so soft as to crumble to dust when pressed between the fingers ( Fig. 210 ) . Unweathered minerals ,  | porous structure , fine texture , and high water-holding capacity help to explain the reputation for high fertility held by loessial soils . 446 . THE GREAT LOESS PLAINS . Because loess plains underlie some of the most productive agricultural regions of the world , attention may here be directed to the situations and characteristics of several of them . North China . The large loessial component in the material of the delta plain of North China has been noted ( 401 ) . Although this plain is composed largely of river sediment much of it is of loessial origin . Either it is loess derived by stream erosion from the hill country to the west , or it was deposited by the wind on the delta surface and subsequently reworked by the shifting delta streams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the word , true loess is believed to be a large component in the soils of all North China and as far beyond as the plains of Manchuria . Figure North America . Loess is likewise an important surface component over a large area in interior United States . It is particularly abundant in association with parts of the older drift , especially the western margin of the area of older glaciation and the drainage ways leading from it ( 430 ) . There the raw glacial deposits appear to have been subject to deflation for thousands of years under semiarid climatic conditions . In a few places only are the deposits so deep , so unchanged by weathering or stream work , so continuous , or so extensive as to constitute what properly may be called loess plains . The deepest accumulations are found in the plain that includes southern and eastern Nebraska and about the western one-fifth of Iowa ( Fig. 211 ) . There the loess in many places reaches a thickness of from 60 to 100 ft .. Since the Missouri River valley traverses this region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its bluffs , as , for example , at Council Bluffs , Iowa . The border zone , which has been dissected by small streams tributary to the Missouri , also has valleys of a peculiarly abrupt and steep-walled type . The loess-mantled uplands are of undulating surface .  | Other deep and extensive accumulations of loesslike earth cover much of eastern Iowa , adjacent parts of Wisconsin , central Illinois , and extend down the eastern bluffs of the Mississippi River . These generally are less deep than those of the Missouri River region , but locally they attain great thickness Figure ( Fig. 212 ) . Still another notable deposit of loess occupies a part of the rolling plateau of eastern Washington and Oregon , where it buries the lava surface . Dust storms are not unfamiliar phenomena even now in the High Plains and Mississippi Basin . The great dust storms of recent years have been made worse by periods of drought , and the material carried by them has accumu-Figure lated locally in large quantities . Some dust is carried to great distances , however . Observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciable quantity as far eastward as New England . In one storm the quantity deposited at Madison , Wis. , was estimated at about 25 tons per square mile . ' It is probable that there is at least a small admixture of loessial Footnote THE PRINCIPAL LOESS DEPOSITS OF THE UNITED STATES .  | material in the surface regolith of most of eastern North America , southern Europe , and other parts of the world . Europe . Associated with the region of older glaciation in central Europe also are considerable deposits of loess or loams of high loess content . They occur over a long belt which extends from central Germany eastward through southern Poland into Russia , where loess is a significant element in the fertile " chernozem " soil , as it is in Nebraska and Argentina ( 626 , Fig. 213 ) . Argentina . The Pampa of Argentina also is characterized by large areas of loess .

In western Buenos Aires province the loess and loessial alluvium reach a total thickness of 50 to 100 ft. and in a few places as much as 500 ft . ' These deposits are believed to have been removed by deflation from the arid belt near the Andes where extensive accumulations of rubble , gravel , and sand remain . The region of greatest loess accumulation has , like that of Nebraska , a subhumid climate . Footnote  | Chapter XVIII . The Shore Features of Plains 447 . THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SHORE FEATURES . The line at which the sea meets the land is a line of transformation . On its two sides are different scenes , different uses , and different means of communication . At that line the flow of trade from land to land by way of the sea must be handled for its ocean voyage . That process is in some places much aided , and in others distinctly handicapped , by the shape of the shore outline , the nature of the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habor and freight-handling problems of a regular , or smooth , shore outline are different from those of one that has deep embayments or other features of a complex irregularity . The problems and profiles of shores which are flanked by mountainous highlands are different from those which open upon gently sloping plains . Because of the differences noted it will be found convenient to consider here , and at comparative length , the essential characteristics of the shores of lowland regions . Thus there will be reserved for later and briefer comment such modifications of the general features of coastal outline and profile as are found in association with plateaus , hill lands , and mountains . 448 . CONDITIONS AFFECTING SHORE OUTLINES . The positions and shapes of shorelines are not unchangeable . On the contrary , several agents and processes work separately or together to bring about their constant reshaping and development . Among the more important of I he conditions involved are the following : ( a ) changes in the relative elevation of land and sea , ( b ) changes resulting from wave erosion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d ) changes resulting from land deposits , and ( e ) changes brought about through the work of corals and other organic agencies . Shoreline changes of the greatest extent would obviously result from any displacement of the land surface with respect to sea level . For example , if the land on a gently sloping plain , extending- seaward as a broad continental shelf , were elevated only a few feet by diastrophic change or if there were a  | correspondingly slight lowering of the sea level by the withdrawal of water from the sea and its retention in great continental ice sheets , a large area of the shallow sea bottom would be exposed . The shoreline , under these circumstances , would migrate slowly seaward and occupy a new position on the flat sea bottom . Such a shoreline would be characterized by regularity and lack of minor indentations . Landward from this shoreline there would be a plain of low relief having only such features as were made by wave erosion and deposition during the emergence and by the land-derived drainage that had to cross it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very shallow water resting upon a gently inclined sea bottom . Such a simple initial shoreline of emergence probably would not remain long unchanged . Waves and currents , by their gradational work , presently would add features that would complicate its outline , and it may be doubted whether there are in existence any extensive examples of the simple shoreline of emergence . 449 . SHORELINES OF SUBMERGENCE AND THEIR FEATURES . Broad diastrophic changes resulting in the depression of a coastal plain would permit a landward encroachment of the sea and would establish a new shoreline upon what was previously the land surface . Such changes are known to have occurred , and they produce shore features whose outlines are not readily erased by the gradational work of waves or streams . The same result clearly would follow a general rise in the level of the oceans , and it may be that such a rise did occur at the close of the glacial period as a result of the return to the oceans of vast quantities of water which had long been held on the lands in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated would result in a submergence of the coastal slopes of the land . Under those conditions the horizontal surface of the sea must intersect with the eroded surface of the land , and the shoreline would assume a position which is that of a contour line upon the former land surface ( Fig. 11 ) . The measure of its irregularity would be determined by the slope of the land surface and the degree of its previous erosional dissection . The slow inundation of low coasts results first in the formation of shorelines of great irregularity . The relief features of an eroded plain , such as a coastal plain , usually are low but broad . Wide , shallow valleys are separated by broad , low interfluves ( Fig. 140 ) . Valleys of that kind have such low gradients that even a slight inundation permits the sea , to enter them for some distance , causing bays . The interstream areas , at the same time , remain only partly submerged and appear as irregular peninsulas or as islands . Some such bays are highly irregular in outline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in massive rocks they normally are dendritic in pattern , and the bays that occupy tluem  | assume the branching forms of the valleys . Others are of simple outline , especially such as occupy glacially scoured troughs or depressions caused by faults transverse to the shoreline . Embayments resulting from submergence are called " drowned valleys " or estuaries , and shorelines characterized by them are called ria shorelines ( Fig. 214A ) . 450 . RIA SHORELINES . Examples of ria shorelines and estuarine rivers upon coastal lowlands are numerous . Most of the eastern shore of North America is characterized by embayments of that class . Some Figure of the individual estuaries , Chesapeake Bay , for example , are of the dendritic type ( Fig. 215 ) . Others , like Delaware Bay and the lower Hudson and St. Lawrence Rivers , are simple in outline . The shorelines of northern New England and eastern Canada are of great irregularity , owing to the submergence of plains of ancient crystalline and sedimentary rocks of complicated structures and varying degrees of resistance to erosion . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rocks of the coastal zone . However , he present shorelines are not merely those of stream erosion and submergence but have also many details of outline and profile given them  | by ice scour during the period of their complete coverage by the continental glaciers . Although the features of submergence have been somewhat modified by wave and current action , some sections retain the Figure high degree of irregularity of their youthful state . Such a shoreline is well illustrated by Casco Bay , Maine , which , according to W. D. Johnson , is a ria shoreline only slightly modified by glacial scour ( Figs. 216 , 217 ) . 451 . THE UTILITY OF RIA SHORELINES . in its youthful stage of development the ria shoreline has numerous estuaries together with certain deposited features , and it is one of great irregularity , with an abundance of sheltered water . Provided its bays are sufficiently deep , and many of them are , this kind of shoreline is one of numerous harbors and of great commercial possibilities . This is shown by the great use made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other estuarine bays of eastern North America . The same is true of western Europe . The estuaries of the Rivers Mersey , Thames , Elbe , Weser . Figure Seine , and Gironde have been capable of such great commercial use because submergence has deepened their waters , making possible t la establishment of ocean ports at considerable distances from their mouths . The larger estuaries in the coastal plains of other continents p 391 serve in like manner , including that of the Rio de la Plata , which is the approach to Montevideo and Buenos Aires . 452 . SHORELINE FEATURES RESULTING FROM MARINE EROSION . A newly established shoreline is subject to attack and modification by wave and current erosion . The attack is most effective upon those parts of the shoreline that are most exposed to the great waves of the open sea , especially the ends of projecting headlands . It is least effective in narrow or well-enclosed bays where waves of great size and force can not reach . The effect of erosion upon the projections of exposed shorelines is to cut them back slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Fig. 214A , B , C ) . On exposed coasts of easily eroded rock the rate of cutting is sufficiently rapid so that whole shorelines are known to be retreating landward at measurable rates . The shoreline of one part of England , for example , is known to Figure have been cut back as much as 2 miles since the time of the Rornan conquest . Shorelines of resistant rock retreat much more slowly . During the erosional process certain characteristic shore features appear . Wave erosion is most effective near average sea level and cuts a notch in the shore profile there . This it enlarges by undercutting and , on strongly eroding shores , produces steep cliffs and bold headlands . The erosion of cliffs in unconsolidated material or weak rock is likely to proceed with comparative evenness , but , in resistant rocks , inequalities in rock hardness or the presence of joints and other lines of weakness sometimes cause it to proceed unequally . Some of the results of differential erosion are the formation of eroded coves , detached chimneylike pinnacles of rock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . As the sea cliff retreats landward under erosion , it leaves behind an eroded base which inclines gently seaward a little below sea level . It is called a wave-cut terrace . Some shorelines are bordered by marine  | terraces of that origin many hundreds or even several thousands of feet wide ( Fig. 219 ) . The shallowness of the water , especially on the newer landward margins of these features , and the presence of submerged rock projections cause them to be a menace to navigation . 453 . SHORELINE FEATURES RESULTING FROM MARINE DEPOSITION . Onshore Features . The rock debris provided by wave and current Figure erosion , together with that derived from streams , is distributed in several characteristic forms along shorelines , and , being added to the land , it greatly affects the shape and utility of the shore outline . On the more steeply sloping shores bordering sea cliffs , large quantities are moved offshore and are deposited beyond the margin of the wavecut terrace in a form which may be called wave-built terrace . Material so deposited is of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is deeply submerged and affects the shore outline but little . Of much greater present importance are the deposits that accumulate in the shallow shore waters and assume shapes and positions that greatly affect the appearance and use of the shoreline . In the early stages of the erosional development of the shoreline of a coastal plain sediment is carried by waves and currents into the  | protected waters of coves and bays , where it accumulates as beaches of sand or pebbles . Locally these fill irregular bay heads , but their fronts are smoothly curved by wave and current action , and the deposits assume shapes that give rise to the name crescent beaches . As the headlands are cut back , the abundant debris accumulates in the shore waters and forms beaches even in front of the eroding shores . This material is subject to continuous removal and redeposition . With the aid of shore currents and undertow it is shifted alongshore until it comes to an angle in the shoreline or to the deeper water of a bay , where it is built up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are added to until they grow above the water surface and project seaward or into the bays as points of sand or gravel which are called spits . In the mouth of a broad bay the shoreward movement of waves and currents past the projecting point of a spit may cause it to grow with a shoreward curve , when it is called a recurred spit or " hook . " Such features are exemplified in the shapes of Sandy Hook , at the entrance of New York Bay , and the curved tip of Cape Cod . En a narrow or shallow bay such a deposit may grow entirely across the entrance , forming a bay bar . By deposits of similar nature adjacent islands may be connected with the shore ( Fig. 214A ) . Offshore Features . Shores having low relief and very shallow waters are characterized by wave-deposited features of another type . Along such shorelines the erosional work of the waves is weak because great waves begin to drag on the shallow bottom , change form , topple , and break at distances of hundreds or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . In doing so they wash forward loose bottom material , only to drop it just landward of the line of breakers and build there a submarine ridge nearly parallel to the shoreline . As this feature grows in height it appears first above sea level as a series of narrow islands ( Fig. 22OA ) . Further deposition by waves and the drift of longshore currents fills gaps between some of the islands and connects them . This forms a long low bar that is called an offshore bar ( Fig . RROB ) . Between offshore bars and their mainland shorelines are long shallow lagoons . Drainage from the land discharges into the lagoon and seeks an outlet through the bar , and in the lagoon the water level rises and falls periodically with the tide , which flows in and out through gaps , or tidal inlets , between sections of the bar . This tends to keep some of the gaps scoured open . An offshore bar does not extend indefinitely parallel to the mainland shore with complete separation from it by a lagoon . Rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points , thus interrupting the continuity of the lagoon . For that reason the  | formation of a bar , broken by inlets , and of segmented lagoons tends to complicate a previously simple shoreline and greatly to lengthen it . It might appear that the many inlets , bays , and islands thus formed would afford protection to shipping and greatly increase the commercial utility of such a shoreline . To some extent they do so , especially for small craft . Canals dredged through the lagoons , connecting one with Figure another , afford long protected routes for light coastwise traffic . It is to be noted , however , that , owing to the nature of the shore , storms are likely to produce very rough water outside the bar , and the approaches to the inlets are shallow , as are the lagoons and channels behind them . Many ships are grounded and lost on shores of this kind , and they are hardly less dangerous than rocky shores or marine erosion . The formation of an offshore bar is followed by its slow migrat ion landward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom in front of the bar , thus deepening the water there , permitting them to attack and cut the front of the bar itself . This material  | is thrown up on the bar shore and is shaped into sand dunes or is wind-drifted back toward the lagoon , widening the bar at the rear as it is cut away in front . This process narrows the lagoon , and river sediment does its part also by aggrading that shallow body of water . After partial filling by sand and silt the lagoon acquires a fringing saltwater vegetation and , at low tide , may be only an expanse of featureless marshland . Eventually the shoreward emigration of the bar carries it to the mainland , the lagoon disappears , and the bar becomes merely a beach upon a shore of simple outline ( Fig. 220C ) . The time required for a transforma- , ion of the type described is long , but the shallow coastal waters of the world show numerous examples of offshore bars and lagoons in various stages of progress from youth to old age and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SHORELINE FEATURES . Among the numerous examples of low coasts with shallow water offshore the Gulf and South Atlantic Coasts of the United States are outstanding . Except where the Mississippi River Delta intervenes , they show generally 72 the estuarine features resulting from submergence and numerous offshore bars which indicate shallow coastal waters . Padre and Matagorda Islands , on the Texas Coast , are offshore bars , and behind them are extensive lagoons and broad shallow estuarine bays . Indian River , on the east coast of Florida , is a long narrow lagoon . Beyond it lies an offshore bar which extends coastwise for more than 100 miles , interrupted only by narrow tidal inlets . This association of bar and lagoon broadens northward into the complicated , currentIwilt , dune-covered projection of Cape Canaveral ( Fig. 221 ) . The Carolina shoreline shows similar features ( Fig. 222 ) . The long bars  | developed there are made up of segments that meet at sharp angles . These appear to result from the influence of various shore currents . They enclose not only lagoons but such broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sounds , which are in part estuarine . Figure The bars on the New Jersey shore , on the other hand , are nearly straight , and they enclose only narrow lagoons . Similar features are found on many other lowland coasts . The North Sea Coast from Netherlands to Denmark is fringed by the long chain of the Frisian Islands , which are separated from the mainland by narrow lagoons . The large lakes on the coast of eastern Germany are cut off from the Baltic by long curving bars that appear to be intermediate in nature and manner of formation between bay bars and offshore bars . 455 . SHORELINE FEATURES RESULTING FROM LAND DEPOSITS . Portions of certain shorelines are characterized not so much by the deposits of waves and currents as by those of rivers , glaciers , and the wind . Among these are the shorelines of the great deltas and delta fans of the world and of innumerable smaller ones . Usually these features present broadly convex Figure fronts to the sea , and their simple outlines are sometimes interrupted by the fingerlike projections of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorelines in some localities . For example , the great embayment which includes New York harbor is estuarine , but the shoreline features of the Long Island Sound portion of it  | result from the submergence of the irregular deposits of a till plain , while the more regular south shore of Long Island is the submerged margin of a great glacial outwash plain . The projecting base of Cape Cod is a partially submerged marginal moraine , while the complicated shoreline of Boston Bay is a submerged till plain in which isolated drumlins create several of the adjacent islands . In Antarctica and parts of Greenland and Alaska portions of the shorelines are created by glacial ice itself . Wind-blown sand is in many places an accompaniment of shoreline development , although it does not often modify the shore outline notably . As soon as beach sands begin to be thrown up by the waves they are readily dried and are then slowly moved by the wind and collect in the form of dunes . On low shores with abundant sand and onshore winds , the dunes may be closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like those of the Figure desert ( 442 ) , and they move in similar manner . They may migrate some thousands of feet or even a very few miles ; but generally they move inland , and in humid climates they tend to become stagnant and overgrown with vegetation before they have traveled far ( Fig. 224 ) . Considerable areas of dune sand are found along the shores of Cape Cod , parts of New Jersey , Virginia , and other sections of the east-facing coast of the United States . In general , these are not so large in area and do not move so far inland as the dunes of the low west-facing coasts of southwestern France , Belgium . Netherlands , and Denmark . There it has been necessary to go to great expense in attempting to plant vegetation upon drifting sand or in other ways to prevent dune encroachment upon highly valuable land or other property . In the United States there are other dune areas , as at various places on the shores of the Pacific Ocean and on the eastern shore of Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many tropical coasts are characterized by reefs of limestone comprised of the crumbled skeletal structures of minute marine animals called corals . Under certain  | conditions corals grow abundantly in shallow waters some distance from a shore , and their deposits form a barrier reef which is separated from the mainland by a broad lagoon . Of this nature is the great reef which for 1,000 miles parallels the northeast coast of Australia . Other coral reefs form about islands . Some small reef-encircled islands , perhaps volcanic , seem to have Figure undergone slow submergence while the coral fringe about them has continued to grow . Such encircling reefs now appear at the surface as low , and more or less complete , coral rings , called atolls , which enclose circular lagoons ( Fig. 225 ) . Fringing reefs grow with such rapidity in some clear , shallow , warm waters as to push a shoreline seaward in spite of wave and current erosion . The shoreline of parts of Cuba is an interesting illustration of the effects of coral growth combined with submergence . Old fringing reefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ele vated and stream eroded . The streams cut fairly wide valleys in the soft rocks back from the shore but only notches through the hard coral rim . A later partial submergence has drowned the river valleys , creating many commodious bays each having a narrow entrance . Cuba has many of these " bottle-neck " harbors ( Fig. 226 ) . Shorelines and Ocean Tides 457 . TIDES AFFECT THE FEATURES AND USES OF SHORELINES . The commercial utility of shorelines is much affected by the depth of their waters as well as by their outlines . The shallow waters and regular shorelines of emerged plains coasts do not favor commercial development , while the estuaries and bays of submerging coasts offer unusual facilities for that use . However , the appearance and use of shorelines Footnote  | of either class are somewhat modified by the occurrence of tides . By their periodic rise and fall , tides alternately deepen and shallow the shore waters , thereby causing difficulties in harbor construction and the movement of commerce . Tidal currents scour channels and keep open some that otherwise might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems of navigation for those who use the channels . 458 . THE NATURE OF TIDES . The tides are broad but very low bulges of the sea which result from the gravitional relation of the earth to the Figure moon and the sun . Without the involved explanation of the cause of tides being attempted , the following facts regarding them may be accepted : If there were no continents , and if deep oceans covered the entire earth , the moon and the sun each would cause two tidal bulges . The two caused by the moon always would be exactly on opposite sides of the earth from each other ( Fig. 227 ) . Their positions would be unchanging with respect to a line ex  - -  t ending from the moon through the center of the earth , but they would advance westward across the oceans , because the earth rotates eastward . A given place on the earth would thus , during the time of one daily rotation , pass through each of the two lunar tidal bulges and each of the intervening lows . It should , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of low tide during each 24 hr . However , the moon advances in its 28-day orbit about the earth at a rate that would delay the tidal recurrence somewhat , and the  | true period between successive high tides would , therefore , be approximately 12 hr. , 25 min. , rather than 12 hr . The two tides caused by the sun also would be on opposite sides of the earth from each other and would have a relation to the sun like that of the lunar tides to the moon , but they are less than one-half as high as those caused by the moon . At times of new moon and of full moon the earth , moon , and sun are nearly in line , the lunar tides and the solar tides occur in the same places , and the height of the solar tides is added to that of those caused Figure by the moon . This causes the high tides of those periods to be unusually high and the intervening low tides of the same periods to be unusually low . They are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the moon is at its first and third quarters the earth-sun line is nearly at right angles with the earth-moon line . The solar tides then fall between , and detract from , the lunar tides . That causes the difference between low and high tide to be less pronounced than usual . They are the periods of neap tide , which also recur every two weeks . 459 . THE OCCURRENCE OF TIDES . Although , under ideal conditions , equal high tides Figure is not the actual condition in many places . Owing to the trends and outlines of different coasts , the depth of coastal waters , the shapes and sizes of the several oceans , and other causes , there is a considerable variation in the height of successive tides at any given station and in the intervals between them . In general , the tides of the Atlantic Ocean conform most nearly to the ideal type . This may be illustrated by a curve showing the actual rise and fall of the tide at New York ( Fig. 228 ) . On some shores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those periods to be unusually high and the intervening low tides of the same periods to be unusually low . They are the periods of spring tide , which recur every two weeks . When the moon is at its first and third quarters the earth-sun line is nearly at right angles with the earth-moon line . The solar tides then fall between , and detract from , the lunar tides . That causes the difference between low and high tide at that time to be  | notably parts of southern Asia and the Caribbean and Gulf shores of America , there is but one high tide per day . ' The shores of the Pacific Ocean generally are characterized by what may be called mixed tides . In them each alternate high tide is much lower than the preceding one . This condition may be illus- oh sh izh leh oh Sh Zh ieh ' eh trated by a curve showing the actual tidal rise and fall at Honolulu ( Fig. 229 ) . 460 . TIDAL RANGE . Not only do the tides of various Figure places differ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The average difference in water level between low and high tide at any place is called its tidal range . In the open ocean it is so slight as not to be noticeable . As the tidal bulges , or waves , approach coasts , however , they tend , like other waves , to increase in height . The amount of the increase is determined by a number of factors . The tides of nearly enclosed bodies of water , such as the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas , are so slight as to be negligible . In sheltered waters , such as the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea , the range is small , usually less than 2 ft . Common tidal ranges on exposed coasts are between 5 and 10 ft. , though in some places less and in others more . In a few localities , some of them the sites of important commercial ports , the tidal range is so great that it is a distinct handicap to the use of the shore . Some harbors , notably Liverpool , England , have required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fall of the water level while ships are loading and unloading cargo at the wharves . Places of great tidal range mainly are situated upon funnel-shaped bays or estuaries , where the tide wave tends to pile up as it moves landward . Cherbourg , France , has an average tidal range of 17 ft. , and Liverpool has a range of 29 ft . The head of the Bay of Fundy , N. S. , has 42 ft. and , at time of spring tide , sometimes as much as .50 ft. of extreme tidal range . Even in the rivers and harbors tributary to the Bay of Fundy ships are temporarily stranded at low tide only to he afloat again a few hours later when the tide sets landward . Footnote  | 461 . THE DISTINGUISHING FEATURES OF PLATEAUS . Plateaus may not always be distinguished easily from the other major physiographic subdivisions of the land . In general , they are characterized by broad uplands of considerable elevation above sea level . Some parts of plateau surfaces are likely to be traversed by deeply cut and relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a high degree of relief . But the deep narrow valleys characteristically are so widely spaced that only a small part of the entire plateau surface is dissected into steep slopes . The ideal plateau is , therefore , high and deeply trenched by narrow valleys , and its interstream areas are broad and flat topped . It is the perfect example of the youthful stage in the cycle of erosion . However , few plateaus are ideal in form . High and much dissected plateaus , on the one hand , grade into hill lands and mountains , while low and little dissected plateaus , on the other , grade into plains . The only features by which plateaus may conveniently be distinguished from plains are their relative degree of local relief and their abrupt termination . Tabular uplands having a relief of more than 500 ft. may be arbitrarily defined as plateaus . In addition , some plateaus are situated so that they terminate in escarpments which make them appear high from at least one side . Most of the great plateaus of the earth have an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That , however , is not particularly distinctive , since some plains are higher . The High Plains of the United States reach an altitude of more than 5,000 ft. but usually are thought of as plains , because , except in their southern portion , they join the interior plain of the continent without the interruption of any high escarpment. 462 . PLATEAUS CLASSED ACCORDING TO THEIR PHYSIOGRAPHIC RELATIONSHIPS . The great plateaus of the earth , shown in Plate VI 1 , are of three major types , when classed according to their physiographic relationships : ( a ) intermontane plateaus , ( b ) piedmont plateaus , and ( e ) continental plateaus , or tablelands. 4oft  | 463 . Intermontane plateaus are segments of the earth 's crust uplifted in association with mountains and more or less nearly surrounded by them . The highest and some of the most extensive plateaus are intermontane in situation . The plateau of Tibet is an eastwardsloping highland much of the surface of which lies at elevations between 10,000 and 15,000 ft. above sea level . On the south of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north are those of the Kunlun . Eastward and westward are mountain borders also , and surplus drainage escapes from the high-rimmed plateau only through deeply cut valleys and gorges which notch the mountain margins . The Altiplane , or high plateau. , of the Andes , lies between eastern and western ranges of the mountains , also at elevations between 10,000 and 15,000 it . These are the highest of the great intermontane plateaus , but others of similar situation are found at lower elevations . Among them are the dry plateaus of Mongolia and the Tarim Basin , in Asia ; the plateau of Mexico ; and , in the United States , a large part of the Great Basin and the Columbia Plateau . 464 . Piedmont plateaus lie between mountains and bordering plains or the seas . Of -. mall piedmont plateaus there are many , but large ones are few . One illustration is found in the plateau of Patagonia . Andean streams have cut it into roughly parallel blocks somewhat like those of the High Plains of the United States . However , instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic in an escarpment 300 to 600 ft. high . The Colorado Plateaus of the United States are , in a sense , piedmont also . They are bordered on the north and east by the high ranges of the Wasatch , Uinta , Rocky , and San Juan Mountains . On the west and south they stand above the adjacent basins in escarpments which are from a few hundreds to as much as 5,000 ft. in height . 465 . Continental plateaus , or tablelands , rise with some abruptness from bordering lowlands or from the sea on most or all of their margins and , in general , do not have conspicuous mountain rims . Some tablelands are small and flat , being merely sections or detached portions of larger plateau surfaces . Others , however , are of great area and have highly complex surface features . Much of Africa , Arabia , and Spain , parts of Australia and peninsular India , and ice-covered Greenland and Antarctica are great tablelands . So much of Africa is tableland that it is sometimes called a continental plateau . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the continent than in the central and northern sections . The surface of the southern plateau averages nearly 3,000 ft. in elevation above sea level , and in places it exceeds 5.000 ft . The Congo Basin and the Saharan tablelands average  | only about 1,000 ft. in elevation , but , in several places at least , that general elevation is maintained to within short distances of the coast , and the coastal slope is comparatively steep . Tablelands in general are areas of relatively recent crustal elevation , and such as have shorelines commonly show regular outlines . In proportion to its great area , Africa has a short shoreline because of its simplicity of outline . For the same reason , it is a coast poorly provided with natural harbors for commercial ports , except in a few places . 466 . The Continental Plateau of Africa . The tableland character of Africa is clearly shown by the gradients of its major streams . Arising in interior uplands , each of the great African rivers , the Nile , Zambezi , Limpopo . Orange , Congo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradient after which it plunges over the plateau escarpment in falls or rapids which make it unnavigable . The fall of the Nile is distributed among its six famous cataracts which are separated from each other by distances of from 150 to 200 miles . The Congo , near its mouth , descends nearly 1,000 ft. from the plateau surface over a stretch of wild rapids . The Zambezi River leaves the plateau by means of Victoria Falls , which are half as wide and twice as high as Niagara . It then descends through a 40-mile gorge and over a series of rapids before it reaches the level of the coastal plain . Even the smaller Orange River has a 300-ft. waterfall in its lower course . The impossibility of reaching the interior of Africa by uninterrupted stream navigation is one of the reasons why that continent was the last to be penetrated by Europeans , although it was bordered on the north by the Mediterranean centers of civilization . The full height of the African plateau is not in all places reached directly from its bordering plains but by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Union of South Africa , where the first step up from the narrow coastal plain is the Little Karroo , a low plateau having an average elevation of about 1,800 ft . This is succeeded by the Great Karroo at about : 2,500 ft. elevation ; and that , in turn , by the High Veld at about 4,000 ft . Each step is rimmed by low mountains or hills . The approaches to the lower tablelands of northern Africa are much simpler and less impressive . 467 . PLATEAU CLASSES RELATED TO ROCK STRUCTURES . Plateaus , like plains , are underlain by rocks of different origins and attitudes , and their conditions of structure are reflected in some of the relief features of the plateau surfaces . Among the major plateaus of the world one or more examples may be found of each of the following classes : ( a ) plateaus underlain principally by horizontal strata , ( b ) plateaus of basaltic lavas , and ( c ) plateaus whose surfaces are uplifted baselevel plains in ancient crystalline rocks ( cf. Plates VI , VII @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this vast region , which is equal in area to the combined areas of Ohio ,  | Indiana , and Illinois , sedimentary strata which total several thousands of feet in thickness lie in nearly horizontal position upon a foundation of crystalline rocks ( Fig. 230 ) . In some places the sediments are faulted , slightly arched , or covered with recent volcanic products , but the principal surface features result from the erosion of nearly horizontal strata . The many segments that comprise the plateau region mainly are flattish , tablelike or steplike plateaus , though some are much dissected . Most of them have been developed on sedimentary strata by dry-land erosion , and they lie at various levels , separated by bold escarpments or by canyons . The surface of the immense plateau of Figure South Africa likewise is dominated by the widespread distribution of a persistent-system of sedimentary rocks . The Columbia Plateau in Washington , Oregon , and Idaho is an outstanding example of the lava plateau . Over an area as large as that of the combined states of New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black basaltic lavas . They occur in nearly horizontal flows of variable thickness one upon another and bury an uneven surface of former erosion ( 336 , Fig. 231 ) . The structures of the northwestern part of the Deccan Plateau of India and part of the plateau of eastern Africa are of similar nature . The plateau of Western Australia may be taken as an example of the third of the above classes . It is predominantly a crystalline  | peneplain uplifted . Similar structures are found in parts of the plateaus of eastern Brazil , where faulted crystalline rocks are covered only in part by later sediments , and also in parts of central Africa and peninsular India ( cf. Plates VI , VII ) . 468 . PLATEAU FEATURES RELATED TO CLIMATIC CONDITIONS . The greater elevation of plateaus makes them even more subject than plains to the development of surface features that reflect the conditions of climate under which their degradation was accomplished . In fact , it is safe to say that the primary classes of plateau landforms are those which depend upon climatic environment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of secondary importance . It is for that reason that plateaus are divided , for the purpose of the following discussion of their features , in accordance with their climatic situations . Plateau Features Developed in Dry Climates 469 . MANY PLATEAUS ARE DIR . The greater number of the world 's plateaus have arid or semiarid climates . There are several reasons for that condition . ( a ) It happens that some of the most notable of broad tectonic uplifts are situated near the margins of the tropics , and their areas fall within the range of trade-wind influence . ( b ) Intermontane plateaus , whatever their general climatic associations , are in the lee of mountain barriers on all sides . ( c ) Certain tablelands present . their higher sides to the prevailing winds and decline gently to the leeward . This has the effect of increasing precipitation on the plateau front and of diminishing it on the plateau surface .  | ( d ) Because plateaus are high the air above them contains less water vapor and is not likely to afford abundant rainfall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precipitation do not long retain their plateau features . Unless they are geologically recent or are composed of highly resistant rocks they shortly are much dissected . Some present hill regions or mountain masses are , in fact , plateau uplifts which have been dissected by streams until their surfaces are no longer plateaulike. 470 . DRY-PLATEAU VALLEYS . The valleys of arid plateaus generally have the features characteristic of erosional youth . Some streams have only shallow valleys , since they are held up to temporary baselevels by resistant strata or by lack of water . However , the exotic and other principal streams are likely to have intrenched themselves deeply into the plateaus and to flow in canyons . The same is true of some tributary streams , even of some that flow only intermittently . The development of canyons , large and small , is the normal result of several conditions . ( a ) Orographic precipitation in bordering mountains furnishes water for streams able to cross the dry-plateau surface and descend to the sea beyond . ( b ) The plateau surface is high above its baselevel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are able to erode deeply . ( c ) Most high plateaus are comprised of solid rocks able to stand in steep slopes when dissected by stream erosion . ( d ) The slow rate of weathering and small amount of slope wash normal to dry climates tend to preserve the steepness of the valley walls . Notable plateau canyons of great length and depth are those of the Colorado and Snake Rivers in the United States , that of the middle course of the Zambezi in South Africa , and the Tibetan courses of the Brahmaputra and other streams that leave the great Asiatic plateau region . Of lesser canyons in most dry plateaus there are thousands , most of them without permanent streams . The typical dry-plateau canyon is not a natural thoroughfare . Its narrow bottom offers little place for a roadway , and its stream , if any , seldom is navigable . Its course is likely to be steep , boulder strewn , and interrupted by rapids and falls . Moreover , it is subject to sudden and large changes in stream level , Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep climb down a precipitous valley wall or by the difficult route of a tributary canyon . It is too deep and too steep to be crossed easily and yet too wide to bridge economically . The deep dry-plateau canyon is more effective as a barrier to communication than as a route of transportation , and the accessibility of the plateau upland is , therefore , in inverse proportion to the  | 471 . THE GRAND CANYON of the Colorado River in Arizona is the most magnificent of its kind . It is the work of a silt-laden , mountain-fed stream of high gradient . The stream crosses high arid plateaus from which it . receives but few permanent tributaries . In one part of its valley it has cut through more than 4,000 ft. of nearly horizontal sedimentary strata and more than 1,000 ft. into crystalline rocks beneath . The erosion of the latter has produced a narrow inner gorge , above which the walls rise in a series of giant steps which are etched by undercutting in the unequally resistant . sediments . The exposed edges of the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benches . Those of the less resistant strata form the intervening slopes ( Fig , 230 ) . The intricate forms of the walls , which hold most of the scenic grandeur , result from arid-land weathering and erosion on a large scale along both joint and bedding planes . 472 . DRY-PLATEAU ESCARPMENTS . Among the conspicuous features of dry plateaus are cliffs and escarpments ( Fig. 232 ) . They Figure result primarily from stream erosion and faulting , the same processes that produce humid-land escarpments . They differ from the latter in the hard sharpness of their outlines . Slow weathering tends to preserve their sharp outlines , and occasional torrential rains cause the intermittent streams to flood and to erode laterally , undercutting and steepening the valley walls and cliffs . Even though the escarpmcrr I s of dry plateaus are well preserved , it does not follow that they are regular in outline . Generally their faces are scarred by many dry ravines , their upland rims are etched into sharp promontories , and often these in turn are notched by gullies . Weathering attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint planes , thus working behind and detaching portions of the rock mass . This gives to marry escarpments fringed or crenate outlines of great intricacy of c let . r i I which are very little obscured by regolith or vegetation . In some kind of rock the weathered features stand as colonnades or pyramids of complicated form ( Fig. 233 ) . Piles of talus ( earth and rocks dislodged from above by the processes of weathering , which the forces of  | erosion are unable to remove as fast as they accumulate ) lie in abundance against the bases of dry-land escarpments except in places so situated that they are swept at rather frequent intervals by the lateral erosion of intermittent streams ( Figs. 231 , 234 ) . Not only do many dry-plateau cliffs have an angular and minute detail of form , but also they have a variety and brilliance of color unknown in humid regions . Dry air and frequent wind abrasion do not favor the abundant growth of the lichens and other small plants which cover the rock cliffs of humid regions with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliffs , therefore , exhibit the full value of their colors , which range from the pure white of gypsum beds through the grays , buffs , and reds of various sedimentary rocks to the ( lull greens , browns , and black of igneous formations . These strong colors often are set against a foreground of desert floor painted in the soft yellowish gray of alkali soils or the glossy browns of desert varnish . 473 . DRY-PLATEAU UPLANDS . The interstream areas of dry plateaus characteristically are fiat or rolling uplands . Some are of vnst. eatent. and are not sharply distinguished from plains . Others , like the Colorado Plateaus , are separated by escarpments into several  | upland levels at different elevations . Some bear upon their surfaces irregularities caused by volcanic activity or faulting . Such features are lava flows , volcanic cones , or short and broken ranges of hills and mountains uplifted along fault lines . The latter find examples in the short Basin Ranges which characterize the Great Basin section of the intermontane plateaus of western United States ( 330 ) . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate size and tabular form ( flat top and steep sides ) is called a mesa ( Figs. 233 , 234 ) . Usually mesas are portions of larger plateaus from which they have been detached by the formation and widening of arroyos , or canyons . In fact the normal progress of erosional development in dry plateaus , through canyon formation and lateral cutting , tends to separate and ultimately to isolate such features . As the valleys Figure are widened the marginal plateau blocks are reduced in area through erosional attack on all sides , but they retain their flat tops . Features of the same origin but of smaller size often are called buttes ( Fig. 234 ) . In some dry plateaus of poorly consolidated sediments erosion has almost completely destroyed the flat upland . Only small mesas , buttes , and pinnacled divides remain separated by fantastically carved arroyos . Surfaces of that kind merge without distinction into low mountains , on the one hand , or , on the other , into hill country of the badland type ( 483 ) . 474 . PLATEAU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plains , are comprised of bolsons or regions of interior drainage ( 438 ) . Because the streams of plateau bolsons drain toward their lowest . interior points and not into the oceans , each bolson has its own local baselevel of erosion and can not be deeply dissected . Thus their surfaces have many of the same general features as those of basins  | in dry plains , from which they may be distinguished mainly by their greater actual elevations above sea level and by the fact that some of them are intermontane in situation . In them are to be found the same rocky pediments , the same alluvial fans , the same desert pavements , and similar collections of drifting sand . At their lowest points , likewise , are features that give evidence of collecting drainage . Some of them contain notable salt lakes . Such are Sevier Lake and Great Salt Lake , Utah ; Mono Lake , California ; Tengri Nor , Koko Nor , and others , in the plateaus of Central Asia ; the lakes of Persia ; and Lake Poopo , Bolivia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of those at higher elevations overflow into lower basins and are kept fresh thereby . That is true of Lake Titicaca , Bolivia , which overflows into Lake Poopo , and of Utah Lake , which overflows into Great Salt Lake . Many plateau basins have not enough water to maintain permanent lakes but contain salt marshes . Examples are seen in the " pans " of South Africa , the Tsaidam Swamp of Central Asia , the Salar de Uyuni of Bolivia , and the Humboldt Salt Marsh of Nevada . Plateau Features Developed in Humid Climates 475 . GENERAL FEATURES . Plateaus that are situated in regions of humid climate tend to be more minutely dissected by stream erosion than are those in regions of dry climate . Some , indeed , are so dissected that they have lost most of their plateau characteristics . The degree of dissection differs , however , not only with the amount and distribution of precipitation but also with the altitude of the plateau , the gradient of its streams , and the kind and structure of its rocks . The Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plateau , and the western front of the Deccan Plateau of India receive heavy rainfalls , are near the sea , and have gradients so steep that they have been dissected into hill regions , locally called mountains . In Brazil and India the precipitation on the broad plateau uplands , though fairly abundant , is less than on the fronts . The drainage from them takes longer routes to sea level and erodes less deeply . Also , in some cases at least , dissection is further retarded by the establishment of temporary baselevels upon the surfaces of resistant rock formations , as , for example , in the rainy Congo Basin of Africa . Although the dissection of that plateau is in progress the basin still is in the youthful stage of erosion , and its surface is relatively flat . 476 . THE MINOR FEATURES OF HUMID-LAND PLATEAUS differ from those of arid plateaus largely because of vigorous downward stream erosion and The greater rapidity of the weathering processes . Some of the stream valleys  | are canyonlike , but generally they have walls that are less steep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since they are more frequently notched by the valleys of the more abundant tributary streams . Broad divides with rounded and irregular upland surfaces are common . In plateaus of slight dissection the upland features do not differ greatly from those of plains under similar climatic conditions . In those of deep dissection the uplands take on tabular form but usually with more rounded features than those of arid lands . This is particularly true in areas of igenous and metamorphic rocks . Resistant sedimentary formations sometimes retain angular escarpments , but usually the rapidity of weathering is sufficient to mantle their lower slopes with piles of talus . In the humid plateaus of the tropics remarkably deep accumulations of regolith blanket both upland levels and lower slopes , and cliffs of bare rock are exposed mainly on upper slopes , where they have been bared by soil creep . Indeed , it is probable that the rounded forms common to uplands in the humid tropics are due more to the slow creep and flow of the deeply weathered regolith than to its removal by surface erosion . Plateau landforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad uplands and deep gorges of limited areas in the Allegheny-Cumberland highland , the highlands of southwestern China , and the Ardennes highland of western Europe . Parts of these uplands are so greatly dissected that they approach hill regions in appearance and merge with them in features . Similar features are common also in the plateaus of eastern Brazil . Central America , and equatorial Africa . The Great Ice Plateaus 477 . SURFACE FEATURES . Vast sheets of ice cover most of Greenland and the Antarctic continent . Presumably they are so nearly like the great ice sheets which once covered large parts of North America and Europe that they may be considered examples for the study of the conformation and behavior of the former continental glaciers ( 359 ) . Both of the existing glaciers may be regarded as great desert plateaus . The Greenland plateau is to a degree intermontane , since its ice is largely held within fringing mountain walls . That of Antarctica for the most part rises sheer for several scores of feet and then slopes rapidly up to a flattish interior which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more than 9,000 ft. in the region of the south geographical pole . Its vast expanse includes an area about , one and two-thirds times the size of the United States , almost entirely ice covered . The surfaces of the great ice plateaus are notably different in features from those of other plateaus . In general they are flat . On their surfaces are parallel ridges a few feet in height , called zaastrug , which result principally from the work of the wind and drifting snow . But , owing to the cold , there are no streams , and consequently there  | are no features comparable with the mesas and canyons of the and plateaus or with the rounded blocks of those in humid climates . If features of such great size could be formed , the slow movement of the plastic ice would presently close the valleys , engulf the eminences , and reduce the surface to its present monotony of uniformity . 478 . MARGINAL FEATURES . Only upon their margins do the great ice plateaus exhibit any variety in surface features . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ice surface of Antarctica descends from the high interior , and the marginal ice thins and is traversed by deep cracks . Except in a few localities , where it is held back by fringing mountains , the ice everywhere overruns the land margin so that the exact position of the shoreline of the continent is not known . The ice edge , whether it is at the land margin or well out into the adjacent sea , is marked by sheer cliffs . From these walls great icebergs are split off by the buoyant effect of the sea water . Some of them are of large area , tabular in form , and almost mesalike in their relation to the parent mass . The icebergs , large and small , disintegrate by melting and disperse as masses of floe or drift ice which fringe the continent for many miles and combine with the ice wall to make it relatively unapproachable.  | The highland or mountainous rim of Greenland , and the higher summer temperatures prevailing there , produce somewhat different features upon the margin of that ice plateau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 235 ) . Since it is held back by the highlands , much of its southern and western front wastes by melting some distance inland . Where it does discharge into the sea it does so by means of tongues of ice , some narrow , some wide , which protrude through gaps in the bordering highland . Between parts of the ice tongues and surrounded by them are islands of rock , called Figure nunataks , which are the peaks of ice-enveloped hills or mountains . These become more numerous near the plateau margin where the hills are higher and the ice thinner ( Fig. 236 ) . There are nunataks in Antarctica also , but they are considerably less numerous . From the tongues of Greenland ice which discharge directly into the sea are derived irregular icebergs which , although they are not so large as some seen in Antarctica , are of ample size to create a hazard to navigation when they drift southward into the foggy North Atlantic steamship lanes in the spring ( Fig. 263 ) .  | 479 . HILL LANDS DISTINGUISHED . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use to elevations as greatly different as mounds and mountains . However , it is desirable that hills be set apart for consideration because there are some ways in which both their appearance as elements of landscape and their degrees of human utility differ from those of plains , plateaus , and mountains . Hill lands are different from plains , even rough plains , in that they have , by definition , considerably greater relief . They differ from plateaus in that they are more minutely dissected and have smaller upland areas . They resemble mountain regions in that they include land of which a large part is in steep slopes . Some very rough hills are mountainlike in comparison with adjacent plains and locally are called mountains . However , in most hill regions the features are less massive than those of mountains , their parts are less complicated , and their detailed features are of a smaller order of size . Although the lines of distinction must be drawn arbitrarily , it will be useful to think of hill lands as being those parts of the earth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the land is in considerable degrees of slope , ( b ) have uplands of small summit area , and ( c ) have local relief of more than 500 but less than about 2,000 ft . The principal world regions of hills , shown in Plate VII , differ considerably , both between regions and between parts of the same region . They differ in their relations to other classes of physical features , in their climatic situations , in their geologic structures , and in their details of relief . It will be observed from Plate VII that some of them border plateaus , of which they are the dissected margins . Others fringe mountain masses ; and still others stand alone in the midst of plains . Few , if any , hill regions derive their features directly from faulting , folding , or volcanic activity . Instead , they acquire them as a result of climatically controlled weathering and erosion in highlands of various origins and structures . Consequently , there are some hill p 416 regions that have developed under similar climates but in different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock structures but under great differences of climate . Given similar conditions of structure and climate , there arise also differences in relief features which are due to local inequalities in the stage of maturity to which the erosional cycle has progressed . There are , for example , hill regions that have evolved through the submature dissection of plateaus . These may retain considerable parts of the old plateau surface in the form of broadly rounded hills which are separated by narrow and steepsided valleys . However , hill lands of ideally mature dissection are reduced almost entirely to a succession of hills , narrow ridges , and V-shaped valleys in which level land may occupy less than 5 per cent of the total area . Some hill regions have been so long subjected to erosion that they are past the extreme irregularity of maturity . Such a region may retain only remnants of its former highland in the form of subdued hills of small summit area , among which open rolling valleys and basins are interspersed . It is obvious that the advantages of hill lands for human settlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maturely dissected hills , having many steep slopes , are badly adapted to tillage . Although those in early maturity of erosion may include some fairly level , plateaulike uplands , these are likely to be separated from each other and from outside regions by steep-sided valleys . Hill regions in a more advanced erosional stage , however , have broadly open valleys and reduced slopes and offer greater advantages for agriculture . Resources of other types are not lacking in hill regions . Because their slopes are in part steep and untillable , some have retained their forests , and they give rise to streams having steep gradients capable of development for water-power production . Rough lands , forests , and swift streams tend also to give them scenic attractiveness and to encourage their development as resort centers . Some also , by the nature of their geologic origin , contain mineral resources of value and have attracted mining industries and settlements . In the following paragraphs a few of the more common kinds of hill lands may be considered with respect to some of their characteristic features and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN REGIONS OF HORIZONTAL STRATA . Some of the roughest hill lands of the world have resulted from mature stream dissection of nearly horizontal sedimentary strata of unequal resistance . In regions of arid climate elevated highlands of that type would  | remain long undissected , maintain a youthful stage of erosion , and have plateau features . In humid regions , the progress of the erosional cycle being more rapid , mature dissection by streams and their numerous perennial tributaries destroys the upland surface and reduces Figure the whole to a maze of hills and valleys . An understanding of the features of such regions and their patterns of arrangement can be reached most readily by studying the development of the dendritic drainage pattern ( 352 ) . The valleys control the pattern of relief , and the hills are but the remnants of the former upland . An excellent illus ,  | tration of this class of hill land is found in that part of the Appalachians called the Allegheny-Cumberland hill region , which extends from northern Pennsylvania to northeastern Alabama . Its features are so distinctive that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 481 . The Allegheny-Cumberland hill region , under humid climate , is deeply and maturely dissected and has local relief which , in general , is between 500 and 7,000 ft . In some localities it exceeds 2,000 or even 3,000 ft. of relief and there assumes the characteristics of low mountains . By the inhabitants most of the region is called mountains ; by geologists it is referred to as a plateau , because it was once an undissected upland of which limited portions still are flattish ; but geographically it is a hill region . The stream pattern of a large part of the Allegheny-Cumberland hill Figure region is dendritic ( Fig. 738 ) . The major streams , having larger volumes , have been able more nearly to grade their courses . They have broadened their valleys and developed narrow floodplains . The secondary streams occupy V-shaped valleys which , however , may be followed by roads and railroads and form the least difficult routes of penetration into the interior of the region . The minor tributary valleys are of great number . They push into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have reduced most of the divides to ridges or to series of isolated hills which are separated by notches or saddles ( Fig. 131B ) . The arrangement of the hills appears patternless , but close observation shows that they follow the trend of the divides of which they are the dissected remnants . The larger hills of any given locality in this region have nearly uniform height the height of the former upland . The smaller hills are lower , because they have been reduced by the close approach of adjacent valleys . Many of them are so separated by erosion that they have the appearance of cones or pyramids . Their general angles of slope are not steep , except where they are sharply undercut by a major valley . Along some of the principal streams the notched and serrate valley walls rise steeply 1,000 to 1,500 ft . Owing to the alternation of resistant and nonresistant sedimentary rocks some of the hillsides consist of sheer rises of a few feet separated by benches or gentle  | slopes . However , because of the more rapid progress of weathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less pronounced in appearance and less sharp in outline than those of arid lands . Although a large part of the Allegheny-Cumberland hill region has reached the stage of mature dissection , some parts of it have passed maturity , and others have not yet reached that stage . On its western margin , especially near the Ohio River , where the original elevation was not great , the streams have more quickly reached grade . In consequence , the valleys are wider and more open , the hills are lower , their slopes less steep , and their tops more broadly rounded than in the heart of the region . On parts of the higher eastern margin of the region , for example , in West Virginia near the bold east-facing escarpment known as the Allegheny Front , erosion has hardly progressed beyond the youthful stage . There the surface is nearly plateaulike ( 476 ) . A broad upland is carved by minor streams into low but rugged hills separated by rolling plains . Through it a major stream , the New River . has cut a gorge more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the western part of this region , especially near the Ohio River , good roads and well-developed farms occupy the spacious valleys while the rounded hills are pastured and only the steeper slopes remain in woodland . In the maturely dissected districts crop land is limited in extent , since both bottomlancls and flat uplands are nearly lacking . Most of the slopes are wooded , but some of surprising steepness are cultivated . Roads , railroads , and settlements are in the narrow valleys . Many of the settlements , largely coal-mining camps , are strung along the valleys in linear pattern ( Fig. 332 ) . In some of the localities of submature dissection , roads , farms , and villages are found on the uplands , although the gorgelike valleys serve as the principal avenues of through railway transportation . 482 . OTHER HILL REGIONS OF HORIZONTAL STRATA . The Allegheny-Cumberland hill region is undoubtedly the largest region in the world of the class of landform above described , but there are many others of some size and importance . Among them are the Ozark hill lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hills bordering the Drakensberg Mountains in southeastern Africa , some of the hill districts of peninsular India , and parts of southern Germany . 483 . BADLANDS . It has been noted previously that mature dissection of plains of poorly consolidated sediments produces very rough surfaces ( 385 ) . Some of that nature have a high degree of local relief and , under subhumid climate , have been eroded into astonishingly complicated hill forms and patterns . These are not essentially different ; in stage of development from the Allegheny region but differ considerably from it in steepness and in fineness of erosional detail and in having lower relief . It was the bewildering maze of sharp hills and  | dry ravines that led the French fur traders to call those of the High Plains , near the Black Hills , mauvaises terres pour traverser . They are eroded in thick beds of clay and in large part are but deeply and minutely dissected plains ( Fig. 239 ) . Still other badlands are found in certain easily eroded rock formations in the dry southwestern plateaus and mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform material will produce similar features . Badland forms eroded in crystalline metamorphic rock of uniform texture are known in the treeless highlands of dry northern China . Figure 484. limns IN REGIONS OF ' FOLDED SEDIMENTARY STRATA . Certain hill regions are characterized by ridges and valleys of linear and roughly parallel patterns of arrangement . These contrast sharply with hills having the dendritic valley pattern discussed above . The linear pattern results from the erosion of elongated folds or crustal wrinkles made by lateral compression in sedimentary rocks of unequal resistance to erosion . Among the notable areas of that kind of surface configuration are the Appalachian ridge-and-valley region which extends from northeastern Pennsylvania southward to Alabama , the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas , and the Jura Mountains on the French-Swiss border . 485 . The Jura Mountains illustrate the parallel arrangement of Bills in their least complicated form of development . In them ridges , mo , t which are not more than 500 to 2,000 ft. in height above the adjar ' ut  | Figure Figure  | valleys , trend for many miles in a northeast-southwest direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuestaform ridges , the eroded bases of resistant members of anticlinal and synclinal folds . The intervening valleys , eroded in the less resistant sediments , are fairly broad . Although they are not excellent land , they contain most of the farms , roads , and villages of the region . Access from one valley to another is through notchlike gorges , locally called cluses , which have been cut across the linear bills by the major streams as they eroded downward in developing the present relief . 486 . The Appalachian ridge-and-valley region is the most notable example in the world of parallel ridges and valleys ( Fig. 240 ) . It differs from the Jura region in that it is in a second cycle of erosion . During its first cycle rugged mountains , the product of intense folding and faulting , were reduced to a peneplain . The region has since been somewhat reelevated , the streams have cut into the plain along the courses in which they previously flowed , and their tributaries have adjusted themselves to the structural conditions by etching out new valleys in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results of the progress of this second cycle of erosion . ( a ) Broad , rough-floored valleys have been carved in the less resistant rocks , mainly limestones and shales. ( b ) The upturned edges of the resistant members of the folds , usually sandstones and conglomerates , are left standing in relief in the form of long , even-crested ridges the summits of which represent the surface level of the old peneplain ( Fig. 241 ) . The major ridges range in height from 500 to 1,500 ft. above the adjacent valleys . They seldom are more than 3 miles wide , but some of them extend almost unbroken , and of remarkably uniform height , to lengths of 25 to 100 miles or more . ( c ) Narrow notches , called water gaps , have been cut through the ridges where the major streams run across their trend . Other notches , begun by streams that changed their courses and abandoned the notch , are called wind gaps . These gaps are the gateways between adjacent , valleys . ( d ) The streams in accomplishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rock structure with the result that a somcwhal rectangular pattern of drainage , called trellis drainage , has evolved ( Fig. 242 ) .  | Some of the valleys of this region are noted for their great continuity , and a few for their agricultural productivity . The most famed is the " Great Valley , " which , under several local names , extends from New York to Alabama . The ridges , because of their steep slopes and thin infertile soils , remain principally in woodlands . A general view " across the grain " of the region includes wooded ridge beyond wooded ridge , with intervening valleys Figure upon whose undulating to rolling bottoms are the fields and patchy woodlands of farms , together with highways and villages ( Fig. 243 ) . Enclosed Valleys . Not all the ridges of the Appalachian ridge-andvalley region are parallel . The anticlines and synclines of which they are the eroded stumps sometimes terminate abruptly , pitch gently beneath the valley level , or merge with one another . Such structures are the causes of great variation in the shapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequently , in the patterns of settlement and the routes of transportation that follow them . Figure 241 shows two enclosed , canoe-shaped valleys which result from the erosion of anticlinal structures . Such a valley may be  | underlain by limestone and contain productive agricultural land , but it is isolated , since the narrow water gap of the stream that eroded it is the only low-level gateway to it . 487 . HILLS IN REGIONS OF COMPLICATED ROCK STRUCTURES . Among the hill regions of the earth it is probable that the greater number are comprised of intermingled rocks of many different origins and highly complicated structures . Some of the regions are , in fact , the eroded remnants of ancient mountain highlands the rocks of which have been repeatedly faulted , folded , and subjected to igneous intrusion . Not only are the rock structures that are concerned with the formation of hills of this class of great variety , but also the features differ as a result of development under unlike conditions of climate . In most . hill regions of complicated structure , differential weathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal features of relief . In some it is the structural features , such as extensive faults , which dominate the scene . In hill regions situated in the rainy low latitudes climatic conditions tend to unify surface features by minimizing the effects of rock character and structure , just as arid environment tends to emphasize those factors . The unifying effects of rainy tropical climate are brought about mainly as a result of active weathering . Chemical decomposition of rock is so rapid that features which , in colder or more arid climates , would erode into angular summits here weather into rounded uplands . Owing also to active weathering and the leaching influence of ground water , the typical soils of the humid tropics are highly porous ( 618 ) . Much of the abundant rainfall soaks into the ground , and the rainsoaked regolith tends to creep or slide . This process sometimes bares the rock upon the steepest upper slopes , but at the same time it tends to soften the transition from upland to lowland with deep accumulations of weathered material . This is notably true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rounded form of the uplands is to be seen even in middle latitudes , as , for example , in the hills and low mountains of the southern crystalline Appalachians ( Fig. 244 ) . Elsewhere , to a greater degree than in the rainy tropics , hill features and hill patterns are influenced by complicated rock structures . Basaltic lava flows may protect weaker rocks beneath and erode into tabular , mesalike hills , even in humid climates . Alternating masses el ' resistant and nonresistant crystalline rocks give rise to areas of interspersed hills and basins . Extensive fault scarps themselves produce ridges which are dissected by streams into hills , or their fault . zoue.s develop linear areas of weakness which streams f i n d and degrade t i l t ) valleys .  | Because of the extreme variety of physical conditions involved in the making of their features , hill regions of complicated rock structure are highly individual and may not readily be grouped into classes according to type . However , attention may be directed to certain hill regions the features of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are distinctive but which are of much more complex origins than the kinds previously described . 488 . The Youthful Plateau-hill Region of Eastern Australia . The highland of eastern Australia is a dissected plateau . Its composition of ancient granites , old sediments , and younger volcanic rocks gives it great local diversity . In one respect it has some degree of unity . From uplands of 12,000 ft. or more elevation many streams , fed by abundant rainfall , descend Figure steeply coastward through deep gorges . Their tributaries have carved the seaward margin of the highland into a hill region of steep slopes and rounded uplands . About the stream headwaters considerable blocks of undissected upland persist , but nearer the coast the hills are more subdued , and the valleys broaden into basins in the rolling surfaces of which there are remnants of the former uplands , still round-topped and steep-sided but reduced to narrow spurs or isolated hills . 489 . The Crystalline Appalachian Highland of the South , popularly known as the Blue Ridge Mountains , is comprised of igneous and metamorphic rocks of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a remnant of ancient mountains . Following reelevation , it has again been much eroded . In part of its broader and higher portion the region has a local relief of more than 2,000 ft. , and its surface has the characteristics of low mountains . Most of its area , however , is a hill region of great irregularity , its various rocks having been weathered and eroded in different ways . Especially toward the western margin of the region , some rocks of great resistance
