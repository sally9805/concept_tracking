txt THE RETORT DISCOURTEOUS . To the Music Editor : I read Mr. Damrosch 's letter regarding Mr. Stokowski 's idea to broadcast experimental ultra-modern music to children . I also read Walter Anderson 's letter published in THE TIMES Nov. 6 , and again " Briton 's " letter in THE TIMES Nov. 13 . Mr. Damrosch stated clearly and courteously what he sincerely believed . Mr. Anderson 's retort was caustic and unnecessarily discourteous to one of the prominent figures in our musical life , while " Briton 's " ( probably ashamed to write his full name ) letter was brutal . Here is one who is willing to believe that Mr. Damrosch may have uttered the truth when he voiced his willingness to wager " that 75 per cent of the ultra-modern works which Mr. Stokowski has given will never be played again , " and I certainly hope such will be the case . It is not a question as to which of these two gentlemen is the better conductor , but at least we should show respect to a musician who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mr. Damrosch has , and who I believe is sincere in his desire to see that our children get started on the right track .
