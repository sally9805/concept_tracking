txt Indications of a growing trend toward solution of the problems which have beset the utility industry in the past year and a half multiplied Thursday . Figures compiled thus far appeared to show that December , like November , brought an increase over the previous year in met earnings of the country 's utilities . November was the first month to show such a gain in five years . Bonds of utility companies led the market Thursday in activity and breadth of advances . These issues have shown steady gains for at least a week . Chief executives of the two companies whose properties are most affected by the TVA program met with the President in a Washington conference described as an effort to reach a sane solution of power problems . Coincident with a substantial upswing lately in utility bonds , preliminary estimates indicate that net earnings of the electric power and light incr.stry in December surpassed those of the corresponding period of the previous year . The same feat was achieved in November . marking the first time it had been accomplished in five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursday by President Roosevelt 's statement that no more projects similar to the ' TVA were being considered by the Administrat%m now . Sweeping gains were scored by American Water Works &; Electric 65 ; Columbia Gas &; Electric 5s of 1952 , and 5s of 1961 ; Central Illinois Electric 5s and other representative issues of this group listed on the Stock Exchange . Recent active advances in the utility bond list have carried leading issues up sharply from thus year 's bottom prices . The Dow-Jones average of 10 utility bonds on Monday set a record high of 100.74 and-closed Thursday only a trifle below that noint . The year 's low so far is 99.94 set on January 2 . Some of the sharper upturns have been as follows : Wide Variation In Reports , Owing to year-end adjustments , the upturn in average net earnings of the electric utilities last month was accompanied by a wide variaLinn in the results of individual companies . So far two of the major systems have reported their December operations , Public Service Corp . of New Jersey and the Commonwealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating income of around 3% and the latter a decline of around 60% . Commonwealth S. Southern , however , is a perfect example of the variation that might occur because of year end adjustments . In its case . the adjustment took place in December , 1933 , by the application of tax credits of in excess of 5750,000 because of overaccruals during the year . boosting December , 1933 , operating income substantially . Had not that adjustment been made . December of this year would have shown at least a 5% improvement . One of the largest groups of properties , reports for which will be forthcoming shortly , experienced an average gain in gross during December of around 9% and in net 10% . In November this same group showed a betterment in gross of 7% and a similar gain in net . Although for a number of months during the past year and a half , gross earnings of the industry ' ran ahead of the previous year increased operating costs and taxes more than absorbed that improvement so that operating income steadily fell behind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by November the betterment in gross earnings started to trickle through to operating income . Electric Output Higher Electric output in December averaged about 7.5% better than in December , 1933 . The Christmas week was exceeded only about four times in the history , an indication of the remarkable progress the industry has made in building up the domestic demand for electricity . There is still widespread agitation for rate reductions and it is quite likely that a goodly number v.-111 be made before the year is over . Already two of the major companies have taken steps to win public favor in this connection with substantial rate cuts . Within the past 10 days . the New York Power St Light Co. put into effect a $600,000 cut with a plan for further reductions ; while the West . Penn Power Co. sliced more than $750,000 from its customers bills , and in addition provided an inducement rate comparing favorably with any section of the country where operations are under similar conditions . The extent to which such reductions and ethers impending will affect 1935 earnings , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefited thereby . If advantage Is taken of the inducement features and residential customers step up their consumption along the lines hoped for and anticipated , the slump in gross earnings resulting from rate cuts will soon only prove a temporary one with an actual gain deveSoping after six months or so Promotional Steps Effective A number of companies during the past year cr more have atempted to meet Administration criticism of rates by the inauguration of very promotional schedules , and have been able to induce a considerable increase in use of current by their domestic customers . It is true . however , that in certain of these instances . the companies have been layered by unusual situations , particularly in the South where the gce. ernment has been spending millions of dollars in making the public electricity conscious . It must be remembered also , however , that the mere reduction of rates is not sufficient to cause increased consumption . A very substantial money expenditure and sales effort must accompany the rate cut and that of course finds reflection in higher operating costs . Electric output of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached wiLhin striking distance of previous record ? olume In at least ore instance . output has been the highest in the 20 years ' history of the properties involved .
