txt The subject of " economic planning " or " business discipline " is not new by any means . But in the last year or so there has been a decided change in the general attitude toward the problem . Only a couple of years ago such proposals ordinarily were considered as tending toward some sort of radicalism ( despite the fact that a number of industrial leaders had already espoused the idea ) . Debate on the subject was pretty well limited to organized economic planning of some sort versus the much-modified laissez faire doctrine under which the United States was transformed from a primarily agricutural nation to the world 's leading industrial community . Opponents of planning called it Utopian . They pointed out that a considerable measure of individualism had made the country what it was and that it was unwise indeed to tamper with the goose that laid golden eggs . Continued economic disorder has rather tended to show that the aforesaid golden goose was n't doing so well any more . It has led more and more people to believe that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was beginning to get clumsy . Once stalled , it %vases ? hard to start again that portions were in danger of rusting away . Who Shall Do the Planning ? Consequently , it is not particularly surprising that the talk now about economic planning ? in both industrial and political circles ? is not so much as to whether it is a good thing but as to who is to handle it . This was the particular point stressed by Gerard Swope . General Electric 's president , in his talk before the Chamber of Commerce of the United States . It is true , of course , that industry 's own efforts to discipline itself have been restricted considerably by the national anti-trust laws . The element of " restraint of trade " is nearly always present , to some extent anyway , in such control . Industrial leaders have naturally feared that Uncle Sam might reward some of their " discipline " efforts with a penitentiary sentence . On the other hand , it can be pointed out that the federal government 's efforts in the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far . For instance , the Transportation Act of 1920 and the actions of the Interstate Commerce Commission under it were nothing less than " planning " of a sort for the railroads . Today that mighty industry is about as bad off as any and worse than some . The Federal Reserve System was , in essence , a step toward " planned banking " under quasi-governmental auspices . For a number of reasons it has n't worked out as expected . The Farm Board did some " planning " for the farmer , which cost the country a few hundred million dollars and left agriculture in more of a mess than ever . Centralized Control Opposed So it is quite apparent that if the admittedly crude control by what is commonly termed " individual self interest , " operating under the price system , is to he supplanted by a less " antiquated " set-up , then the problem centers about these questions : Who is to have control ? How wisely can that control be administered ? The big objection ordinarily advanced to a highly centralized control is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men can possibly know enough about this country 's gigantic industrial machine to manage it . It is suggested that without supernatural powers and ability they would wreck the entire system . The revised national industrial recovery act now described in press reports from Washington seems to contemplate a much less centralized regulation than the original draft implied . It apparently seeks , in other words , to permit individual industries to have a large measure of self-regulation  --  with necessary exemptions from anti-trust law prosecution  --  subject to check by a governmental agency that would protect the public . ? e ? Storey 's Work for Atchison A Chicago correspondent of The Wall Street Journal , who has known Atchison Railway 's retiring President , William B. Storey , for a good many years , characterizes him as primarily a railroad conservator rather than a railroad builder . Nevetheless , considerably new mileage was added to the system under his administration , although the expansion possibilities were not as great as those of his predecessor . This correspondent goes on to point out that Mr. Storey looked at the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took out curves , eliminated grades and added heavier motive power as rapidly as funds became available . He leaves Atchison with its main lines in position to handle through traffic and traffic fed to them by branch lines at a minimum of cost . Remembering always the factors that led the Atchison at one time into receivership , he continued the policies of former President Ripley in holding down funded debt and conserving liquid resources . Consequently , the road last year covered fixed charges of $1,000,000 a month with a margin to spare sufficient to more than take care of preferred dividends , and has large holdings of cash and government bonds . His views on other subjects as well inclined to the conservative . Occupying , in a sense , a unique position in the railroad world he did not hesitate to express them forcibly on occasion . He once remarked that in his opinion the depression in this country would not end until every one sincerely tried to get some job , " even if It is only herding hog/I . ' : He ascribed his remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out healthy and long-lived parents . " His rise up the railroad ladder he attributed to " a disposition to stick at ft and being around when the breaks came . "
