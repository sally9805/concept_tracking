In 1922 the foremost scoffer at the gene theory of heredity , England 's formidable , bushy-browed Biologist William Bateson , went to the Columbia University laboratories of Thomas Hunt Morgan , examined the data , looked at the jars of fruit flies , stared down the microscopes , announced his conversion . Since then there has been little doubt among geneticists that the chromosomes in the germ cells are the theatres of heredity , that the ultimate agents , called genes , which transmit unit characters , occupy definite and fixed positions along the spindly , crooked chromosomes . Since then fame has come to Dr. Morgan and his flies , and to some of his early laboratory helpers , notably to affable , shock-haired Calvin Blackman Bridges of the Carnegie Institution of Washington . <P> Born in Schuyler Falls . N. Y. 47 years ago , Bridges found himself some years later in a zoology class at Columbia which Dr. Morgan had agreed to take while the regular professor was away . Dr. Morgan changed the young man 's general interest in science to a specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , asked if help was not needed with the bottles of flies . Morgan replied gently that trained assistants were what he needed . Undaunted , Bridges kept coming back . One day he spotted a fly with vermilion eyes instead of the normal red . Dr. Morgan had had to etherize the insects and go over them with a magnifying glass to verify the mutation . He admired Bridges ' eyesight , gave him a job nursing the flies forthwith . <P> No geneticist will say that he has seen a gene , but last week Dr. Bridges would not say that he had not seen one . The chromosomes themselves in the fruit fly 's germ cells are no larger than .00015 inch long , minute dots and streaks under the best microscopes . The chromosomes in the fly 's salivary glands , however , are 70 times bigger than those in the germ-plasm , and two years ago Dr. Theophilus Shickel Painter of University of Texas took pioneer photographs of these tiny giants showing cross-bands . Then Dr. Bridges made such good photomicrographs of the salivary chromosomes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , and the bands themselves were seen to be dotted or segmented ( TIME , Oct. 1 , 1934 ) . <P> Last week Dr. Bridges published in Science further researches with charts clearly showing a gene maneuver associated with the appearance of abnormally small eyes in the fly . This mutation , discovered in 1913 , was christened " Bar . " Some true-breeding strains showing the Bar mutant developed other mutations in which the eye was even further reduced ( " Bar-double " ) or returned to normal ( " Bar-reverted " ) . <P> Down toward the base of the X-chromosome is a sudden bulge followed by a gradual tapering to normal diameter . This is the " turnip segment . " It contains , first , a heavy band in two segments , then a faint dotted line , a stronger dotted line , a diffuse double line , a faint dotted line . In the Bar flies Dr. Bridges found this arrangement in duplicate . In the Bar-double it was tripled . In the Bar-reverted it returned to the single sequence .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
