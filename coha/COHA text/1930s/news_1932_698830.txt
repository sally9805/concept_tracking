Encouraged by reports that President Hoover had shown , favor for the sales tax in discussing the matter with visiting publishers at the White House last night , a Senate group headed by Senators Reed of Pennsylvania and Walsh of Massachusetts was organizing a coalition to restore the levy which caused such an uproar in the House . Plans were completed to bring up the sales-tax amendment already introduced by Mr. Walsh as soon as final action has been taken on the special taxes in the pending bill , probably tomorrow or Saturday ; this would bring the sales tax show-down probably early next week . The Sales-tax coalition was said to consist already of about forty-four Senators .

Handlers of the tax bill were making every effort today to perfect the measure so that a sales tax would not be necessary . Chairman Smoot of the Finance Committee , who is an advocate of the sales tax , still held the opinion that there was no chance for it to pass at this session ; he was taking no part in organizing the coalition . It was his hope , as well as that of Senator Harrison , ranking Democrat on the committee , that the Senate would be satisfied with the special excises . Senators Smoot and Harrison both figured that if the excises came anywhere near promising sufficient added revenue to balance the budget , the sales tax would be discarded . In keeping with this view , they strove to maintain the provisions of each item of revenue at as high a yield as possible . Despite their efforts , the bill suffered a net loss during the day of $48,000,000 . Proponents of the sales tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special excise in the expectation that the unpopularity of these items in the aggregate would furnish additional votes for the sales tax . Others , following a different course , were voting against the special excises in the expectation of creating such a deficiency in the bill that the Senate would be forced to turn to the sales tax in order to raise the necessary revenue . The result of all this was tonight that the excises had passed into the bill , but it was still a question whether the irksome levies had alienated enough votes to guarantee the sales tax . Today Representative Crisp . acting chairman of the Ways and Means Committee , said after a visit to the White House that about thirty members of the House who voted against the tax would now vote for it if they had the chance . In his own opinion. , said Mr. Crisp , the sales tax would have &; fair chance of adoption if it came before the House at this time .

By this move it was hoped much of the opposition to the admissions tax would be removed . The exemption was not quite high enough for the Senate , however . On a motion of Senator Johnson , the exemption was raised to 40 cents , making the tax applicable on all tickets of 41 cents and more . While this exemption was still 5 cents lower than the amount fixed by the House , the Senate 's adjustment of the tax took , $66,000,000 from the bill 's revenue capacity . Senator Wagner made an unsuccessful attempt to have admissions to legitimate plays left with the present exemption of $3 . His amendment was defeated 39 to 28 . The committee proposal for a tax on telegraph , telephone , radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Senator Dill immediately offered an amendment to exempt from the tax any services or facilities used by radio broadcasters in sending out non-commercial programs . This , too , was adopted without a record ballot . Senator Bankhead insisted that newspapers and newS associations be exempt from paying tax on messages or wire facilities used in gathering and transmitting news . He contended that such a tax might be held unconstitutional on the ground that it tended to " abridge " the freedom of the press . " If it did not abridge the dissemination of public information for some smaller newspapers entirely , it would seriously curtail it , " he declared . When Senator . Smoot sought to cut off Mr. Bankhead 's speech with a request for a vote , the latter said he would gladly stop speaking if the Senate would adopt his amendment to exempt news dispatches and news wires . The trade was effected and the exemption reinserted . Postal Increases to Be tip Soon .
