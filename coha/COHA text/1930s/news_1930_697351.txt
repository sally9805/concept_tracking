txt A fall in prices such as has occurred in the past eight or nine months is bound to affect the business situation in numerous ways , sometimes rather obscurely . In one direction , however , the result is visible and unmistakable ; the rapid reduction of value in foreign trade . The lately published statements for July and for the seven completed months of 1930 are therefore of peculiar interest . Our own exports and imports combined have decreased during the seven-month period , as compared with a year ago , by the substantial sum of $1,365 , - 000,000 , or 24 per cent . Their aggregate value is the smallest since 1922 , although not so much below 1923 and 1924 as might have been supposed . With Great Britain the seven months ' foreign trade has fallen , in American values , $765,000,000 , or about 13 per cent ; with France the decrease has been $280,000,000 , or 9% per cent . The relatively smaller decrease in the case of those two countries is mostly due to the fact that our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume and value , whereas that of France and England did not vary greatly from the previous average . The result with all three nations is formidable enough . The decrease does not measure up to the showing of the " deflation year " 1921 , when the aggregate value of our own exports and imports was reduced from 1920 in the same seven months no less than $4,024,000,000 , or 48 per cent ; and when the collapse in England 's foreign trade was nearly $5,000,000,000 , or 471/4 per cent . But average prices during 1921 , as computed by our Labor Department and by the British Board of Trade , were 36% per cent lower in the United States than the year before , and 351/4 per cent lower in England , whereas prices during the past seven months have averaged S or 9 per cent below 1929 , and in July alone were down 14 per cent . Two questions arise in connection with such sweeping reduction in value of exports and imports : First , how much of the shrinkage was due to lower prices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surplus of exports or imports was affected . The percentage decrease of the trade valuation in 1921 , as the foregoing figures show , was far greater than the percentage fall in prices , and so it has evidently been this year , especially with the United States . That result accords with common knowledge regarding the relative quantity of export and import movements , during 1930 and a year ago . It is impossible , however , to determine the precise decrease in quantity through the use of average valuations . ' The total decrease of volume might easily , in our own case , exceed 10 or 15 per cent , irregularly distributed . The effect on the " trade balance " of the shrinkage in export and import valuations has been interesting . In so far as such reductions are wholly due to lower prices , they should reduce proportionately the previous surplus , whether of exports or imports . If the dollar value of our outward and inward trade were to be uniformly cut , say , 10 per cent , because of a 10 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of imports would obviously be reduced in the same percentage . In our own foreign trade this would create a smaller " export surplus " ; with Great Britain , the " import surplus " would decline . Yet this is precisely what has not happened . In the seven months ended last July , value of the American import trade was reduced 221/4 per cent against a 26 per cent cut in exports , whereas Great Britain 's exports were reduced 16% per cent against only 101/4 per cent reduction in the exports . As a consequence , our own surplus of exports for the seven months ' period was actually some $4,000,000 larger than in 1929 , while England 's surplus of imports increased more than $50,000,000 . The explanation of this seeming anomaly lies in the fact that , in a period of hard times in business , America traditionally cuts imports to the lowest figure and presses exports on the market , but that Great Britain is at present greatly handicapped in its export market , while confronted with unusually urgent and effective competition from imported merchandise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
