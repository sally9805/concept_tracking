txt Our Berlin dispatch of yesterday uses the term " appalling " to describe the unemployment situation in Germany ; the number of people without work is now estimated at 5,000,000 . At home , the State Industrial Commissioner , FRANCES PERKINS , believes that our unemployed number 7,000,000 . For the world , excluding Asia , the League of Nations some time ago estimated 20,000,000 unemployed . There is something to be said on the other side , even if it sounds like paradox . Totals of world unemployment begin to be less appalling as they continue to mount . An appalling situation is a hopeless situation . But as the figures assume epidemic proportions they lose something of their grim menace for the very reason that an epidemic is a passing phenomenon . As the millions of unemployed continue to pile up , there comes , along with the serious immediate consequences , a growing conviction that the thing can not last very long . From this point of view the 2,000,000 unemployed whom Great Britain had on her hands year in year out from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more " appalling " problem than the more than 3,000,000 whom she must support today . The 3,000,000 are emergency ; the earlier 2,000,000 seemed destined to become an irreducible minimum , a chronic sore . The same considerations would hold for an upward leap in unemployment from a normal million in Germany to five million , from a normal one million in the United States to seven million . The plea put forward by all the Governments , that the unemployment situation is world-wide , has more merit than one suspects at first sight . It is not a case of misery loving company , or of being no worse off than the other fellow . It goes even beyond the perfectly sound contention that all the nations are in the grip of forces beyond their control : here overproduction of motor cars , and there the collapse of silver , and there again the blockade of the India market . Unemployment is truly a world-wide condition in the sense that unemployment in one part of the world is the cause of it in many other parts . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are six or seven million idle workers in the United States and more than three million in Great Britain . Unemployment creates unemployment in a vicious circle 25,000 miles in circumference . But it must be a very vicious circle which does not manage to get itself broken , and almost simultaneously , along the entire circumference . A hundred thousand less unemployed in the United States means so many scores of thousands less in Germany and so many thousands less in Great Britain . There are exceptions , but that is the rule . What the economic system of the world is now suffering from may be a severe case of nervous breakdown , but it is not the cancer or the arteriosclerosis which our good friends in Moscow would like to diagnose for us . The record of the extraordinary recovery made by the nations from the wounds and shocks of the World War is still too fresh in mind ' to make it thinkable that health has gone out of us permanently .               @ @ @ @ @ @
