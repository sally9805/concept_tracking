Long dead was Tibet 's latest temporal god , the Dalai Lama . Last week , according to reports from India , Tibet still lacked living gods , was becoming increasingly embarrassed at having in its midst one god who was extremely dead . From Jyekundo , where the Panchen Lama died , a retinue of 1,000 lamas , Chinese soldiers and relations of the Buddha set out last winter to take his body to Lhasa , to bury it with proper ritual . Unable or unwilling to embalm it , they wrapped it , in a sitting position , in cloths . <P> Traveling ten miles a day in stately procession , they encamped at night in lamaseries or caravansaries , surrounded the Panchen Lama with hundreds of yak-butter lamps . The caravan finally arrived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting odorously in his cerements . The Chinese troops wished to accompany the body to Lhasa ; the Tibetans wanted no foreign soldiers ; neither side gave in . Of authentic infant candidates to reincarnate and succeed either the Dalai or Panchen Lamas , no word had reached the outside world last week .
