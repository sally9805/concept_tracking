txt Mr. Rogers Finds Down in Texas A Nice , Homey Little Place To the Editor of The New York Times : VERNON , Texas , July 6 . ? Ranches are all gone ? Yeah ? Well , I am on one right now of 600,000 acres , belonging to W. T. Waggoner , with 25,000 cattle and some of the best horses in any State . He is one cowman that was smart enough to solve the low prices of cattle and make ranches pay . Every cow has got her own oil well . The town this will be sent from is Vernon , an old-time cow town , but now a place that is a real modern Claremore . Court house bigger than Gamer 's Capitol in Washington . Garner is the talk of everybody in Texas . These people down here do n't know that there is a guy named Roosevelt that is mixed up with him in this new enterprise . The ticket down here is " Garner and Garner . " Yours , WILL ROGERS .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
