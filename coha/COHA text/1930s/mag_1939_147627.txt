THE LIFE AND TIMES OF WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT-Henry F. Prlngle-Farrar &; Rineharf ( 2 vols. $7.50 ) . <P> Noting resemblances between the first and the second Roosevelt has been the pastime of many a pundit . Along about 1942 , equally instructive parallels may perhaps be noted between their successors . To any such exercises , Henry F. Pringle 's biography of Taft should be indispensable . Winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1932 for his biography of Theodore Roosevelt , Pringle was well qualified to write about the man whom T. R. picked for President and , later , bitterly denounced . Nearly 500,000 Taft letters and papers were placed at his disposal by the Taft family . The result : a play-by-play account of an underestimated administration , a just portrait of a just man . <P> " Big Lub " to other ball players and rock fighters in Cincinnati when he was a boy , William Howard Taft was large but not lubberly . At Yale he worked hard , though he complained about it . As a young lawyer he was sound if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1900 he was happier , and in one anti-trust decision soberly took issue with a more lenient Supreme Court . As president of the Philippine Commission , he replaced military rule with the rule of law , achieved one of those enormous successes that make diffident men more diffident . Time after time his enthusiastic friend , President Theodore Roosevelt , invited " Dear Will " to return to Washington , finally got him back as <P> Secretary of War . At heart Taft dreaded the next step , but " Dear Theodore " and Mrs. Taft won out . In 1909 he was President and T. R. was no longer there to guide him ; T. R. was in Africa hunting " lions . <P> Taft himself shared the inability of the country at large to shake off the spell of the Rough Rider ; but Pringle 's evidence makes it clear that in certain essential particulars Roosevelt left his friend to face the music . T. R. 's liberalism had somehow avoided the high tariff ; Taft had to cope with that . T. R. had swung the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it connect . T. R. had been supple enough to play politics with a conservative Congress without seeming to do so ; Taft had to temper Uncle Joe Cannon and was promptly accused of bowing to him . T. R. 's bouncing spirit rode the ground swell of the Progressive movement ; Taft was too solid to bounce . His great girth , white walrus moustaches and booming chuckle made it easy for people to like him at first , just as easy for them to see him later as an affable pushover for Big Business .
