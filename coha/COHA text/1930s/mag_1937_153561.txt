Proportionally better attended than President Roosevelt 's weekend party at the Jefferson Islands Club ( see p. 7 ) was the annual commencement of the J. Russell Young School of Expression this week in Washington . This school has no endowment , no buildings , but claims the White House grounds for its campus . Its function is to spot notable feats of word-spouting and to reward them with 50 diplomas , all " Doctor of Oratory , ' ' all cum laude or better . Its ceremonial dinner at the Mayflower Hotel brought 125 acceptances out of 130 invitations issued to Washington correspondents , three Cabinet members , one Senator ( Pat Harrison ) , but no Representatives . <P> Seventeen diplomas were handed out between speeches . Had he not failed to appear , James Roosevelt would have got one " for his reply to the President of Brazil , thanking him for the decoration of the Brazilian Order of the Southern Cross , fully earned because nobody knew what James Roosevelt said , not even those who understood Spanish . " *Attorney General Homer Stille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before a packed Supreme Court . " <P> Founder and inspiration of the School of Expression is John Russell Young , 55 , White House correspondent of the Washington Star , who looks so much like a storybook Senator that waiters always serve him first . He is a delight to President Roosevelt , who calls him " the Senator , " and when in a tight fix at press conferences often finds an out with : " I think I 'll deliver the Senator 's No. 17 . " Young , good schoolmaster that he is , has a set of speeches for any occasion . No. 1 is " Our Flag , " No. 8 is " America the Beautiful , " No. 12 is " For a United Party " ( now in great demand ) . <P> *Most Brazilians speak Portuguese .
