THE WAY THE LUCK RUNS A STORY BY IRA WOLFERT T ttE two fermented apple pies I had had for breakfast had been pretty filling , but that had been a Iong time ago , and this fellow looked like meat to me . I thought that when the time came I 'd make a play for a feed . I waited for him to talk himself out while we rolled along in the cool of the evening . Yes , sir , that 's when it was , in the cool of the gloaming . He was a thin little pale man with a natty mustache . He looked like a brushed-up clerk , but I guess he was a cigar salesman . He had a brief case and a pile of cigar boxes in the back of the car . His face looked soft . When he put a scowl on or acted hard you could see the weakness quavering under it . I thought , " My luck 's going to change now . He 's good for meat and potatoes . " That seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I could look out the window and notice the time of day and enjoy seeing that it was getting on into evening . My luck needed changing . It had been needing it since two weeks after I ran out of money and a job in Logansport and the landlady locked me out . The landlady met me at the door when I came in and told me she would n't let me into my room until I paid what I owed . I had to think fast . Everything I owned that stood between me and being a bum was in that room . I asked her if she 'd be so kind and sweet and obliging as to let me go upstairs and copy off my stepmother 's address . My stepmotherwas n't anything to me . She had been married to my father four months when I lit out on my own and 1 saw her only once after that , a year ago at my father 's funeral . A fellow from home , whom I met on a job in Dallas , told me about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figuring some day maybe I would write to her . Well , it was something to think of as an excuse to get into the room . Once I got in there , I figured , I 'd be able to get some of my clothes out under my shirt and in my pants . But the landlady went upstairs with me and stood there watching me . I said , " Can I take my shaving stuff too , because you ca n't get anything selling it , and maybe an extra shirt , one of the old ones . I 'll leave all the rest . " She let me take the shaving stuff . " I ca n't help myself , " she said , " I got to eat too . " " That 's right , " I said . " All God 's chillun got to eat . " " I do n't run a rooming house because I enjoy it , " she said and I said , " Guess that 's the trouble with all God 's chillun . They got to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When I was out in the street and started thinking what I was up against , I got scared . I did n't have a dime . I could push my hands into my pockets clear down to the seams without touching anything . My stepmother 's address was the only thing I had . Finally I figured out that I 'd be better off beating my way back on the road instead of hopping a freight . I thought , on the road you can pick up food and you 're meeting people all the time and you might just talk yourself into a job and not have to go to Harrisburg at all . Well , that shows how much I knew , six days ago , back there in Logansport . I had luck getting across Louisiana . I suppose I should have headed north , but the rides were all going east and south . I took them as they came and I figured it was all right because I did n't have an overcoat anyway and the North was likely to be cold in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started to learn things  --  about vagrancy in the back country meaning thirty , sixty days on the chain gang or meaning running the gauntlet through a bunch of farmers out back of the jail , everybody taking slugs at you and having a fine time breaking the blood out of you and the sheriff coming up at the end . and giving you a root in the pants and saying , " That 's a sample , anytime you want more just come back . " I guess they have to be tough in the winter or they 'd have every bum in the country on their necks , stealing whatever is loose . Keep moving , keep moving As long as you keep moving on through they let you alone . In country like that you 're no ant at a picnic . You 're afraid to ask a fellow for a handout because that would show you 're a vagrant and you just keep moving , keeping the cops off you by sticking to the highways and making out you 're not interested in anything except getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until last night when I went to sleep hungry in an oak patch . I woke up in the middle of the night with my stomach so raw and hot from hunger I could n't sleep any more . I guess it must have been one or two o'clock when I woke up . It must have been three or four hours that I lay there in the oak patch waiting for sun-up . I waited because the fellow who walks an Alabama road at night , when there is no chance to grab a ride , is going to get picked up sure by one of those cruising cops . I drank water out of a brook tofill my stomach up with something . It was that muddy red water that tastes warm and slimy and makes you feel you 're licking a frog . I drank so much of it that it hurt me inside to stand up . But it did n't help the hunger and I just lay there with my belly all swollen with water and hunger . When the day finally came I walked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hotel there into the kitchen . A sleepy-eyed nigger was crisping bacon and had a pot of coffee going and there was an aroma that made my mouth water so much I had to swallow several times before I could say a word . He gave me the two fermented pies . I asked the nigger , " Can you spare a cup of coffee ? Just black , I would n't want sugar or milk , " and he told me no . " Hear white trash talkin ' , " he said . " Maybe he wouldn ' want some po'k sossages y'either , no-sub . " They throw out fermented pies , but I guess they never throw out coffee . Well , I looked all set for to-night anyway and I could stop thinking about getting hungry and about being afraid to ask for something to eat and that what happened last night was going to happen again to-night sure as hell is hot . I could sit back and enjoy the ride and enjoy sitting side by side with this fellow , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same stretch of road , side by side , shoulder to shoulder , almost like I was a member of the family and there was nothing between us but the same thoughts . All the same I could n't forget for long that he was in the driver 's seat and I was just something he had picked up . He had seen my thumb and put on his brakes and pulled to the side because he had no radio in the car and was lonely for something to talk to . I went running along the road after him , head down , running hard because I did n't want to inconvenience him . " You going to Valdosta ? " I said . I had learned that much . I had learned it 's always good at the start to make it look as if you 're heading somewhere definite . " Past there , " he said . " Well , that 's fine , " I told him . " I 'm going past there too . " He kept talking how 1938 was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much fat under their belts now as then and scared more easily and I kept telling him , guess you 're right all right , and kept thinking it did me good to hear him talk . Even if he was singing the blues , it was good not to be listening to myself thinking , " If only I passed a field with something growing in it besides cotton stalks , if only somebody dropped something on the road , a camera or a pair of eyeglasses or a fifty-cent piece or a twenty-dollar bill . " After a while he was beginning to run down and I picked a silent minute and said , " Say , do you know where a fellow can get something to eat around here ? " " Eat ? " he said , " eat ? " Like it was something he had never heard of . " I 'm not stopping anywhere if that 's what you want to know . You can get out at any of these bar-b-q 's , but I ca n't wait for you . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right . I could tell by the way he stiffened up that he knew I was trying to touch him for a feed . I did n't say anything . I was n't going to press the point in chain-gang country and he kept looking straight ahead , his body stiff , his face set hard , the weakness quavering on it under the scowl . I knew he felt I had pegged him for a sucker because he had stopped to give me a ride . He was sore that I should think he was an easy mark . I hoped he 'd start talking and get back to where he felt comfortable again and let me ride with him into Valdosta at least . But after a few minutes he said , " I 'm turning off here . You better stick on the main road . " I knew how he felt . I had been in the same boat myself  --  sore and ashamed and not seeing any way to climb down . " Thanks mister , " I said , but he was still hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did not turn his head . Iwatched him go straight on down the highway , making no turn , and I said , out loud slowly , " Mister , you stink , " There was some kind of luck running my way anyway . I did n't have to walk long . Two niggers came along in an empty truck . They were going to Waycross . A fellow once told me , long ago , when I did n't need to know , when I had money in my pocket and keys and nothing to worry about except what a mutt the boss was or what to do on Saturday night , that you can always tap a nigger for something . He said it made a nigger feel important to help out a white man . But , I thought , what 's the use asking these fellows and taking a chance of getting kicked off . They did n't look as if they had anything anyway and Waycross was a big town , almost as big as Dothan . I had a chance there . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this bumming along the road . I 'd just sit in the freight and think how hungry I was for two days or maybe two nights and two days . But at least I 'd be moving and have the feeling I 'm getting somewhere to the end of all this fast . I would n't be walking along cotton patches or bare orchards thinking what I 'd be having if this was Indiana or Virginia or Maryland or Pennsylvania . There would be no more of this being afraid to stop in the daytime and being afraid to go in the nighttime because that would get the cops on you and no more of this thinking about the cars going by with money inside them and the smell of frying from the bar-b-q stands and a fellow driving by with a toothpick in his mouth and grease on his lips and a girl coming by drunk , singing , with maybe two dollars ' worth of liquor in her at bar prices . She 'd poured enough liquor down her throat to buy me a week 's worth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was more luck for me . Supper trade was over and you always had a chance for a handout from a restaurant . If they wanted to they 'd give you the stuff they knew they could n't sell any more and that would spoil by morning , a bowl of soup or something . Anyway , I heard that somewhere . Knocking around from job to job , I heard tell of so many things that keep coming back to me , it seems like I must have been training to be a bum all my life without knowing . The first place I looked into was too crowded . There were six or eight people sitting around eating . I did n't want to make a show of myself . The next place there was only a fellow and his girl sitting over a cup of coffee , looking at each other like they were something to eat , and the counter-man sitting on a stool by the cash register , reading a paper . The Waycross , Journal Herald . He was turned to the comic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue-eyed , black-haired Irishman with wet lips and rosy cheeks . He had only one arm . " Mister , " I said in a low tone of voice . He looked up startled . " Have you got any work for me to do ? " His mouth was open and the fright had gone out of his face . " That 's all taken care of , " he said . He was trying to keep his face emotionless and I thought suddenly , he sure looks plenty dumb . " Sweeping up , " I said , " dishes , laundry work , polishing the silver . " " No , " he said , shaking his head slowly , " that 's all taken care of . " ' For a bowl of soup or a piece of fish or something that you 're going to have to throw out when you close anyway . " " All taken care of , " he said . He was looking past me , beyond my shoulder , trying not to see me . Well , you dumb oof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ca n't you change the record ? I would have to pick a guy whose first instinct is to say no to anything that comes up unexpectedly . But , that kind of guy is all right if you play him right , if you can hang around long enough to give his mind a chance to get used to what you 're asking . " I could empty the garbage for you or burn it , " I said , " or maybe chop some wood . Do you burn wood in thekitchen ? " He looked like a nice fellow . He really looked nice . I talked very slowly and I thought if I just stand in front of him long enough he 'll melt down . Then I noticed there was someone alongside me , looking me up and down , and I turned around and saw it was a cop . I felt sick . I felt the hackles rise at the base of my skull . I started to walk past him . I got a couple steps toward the door and he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run . I thought " I 'll break through the door . How many steps to the corner and around it and out of sight ? But the cop ' 11 be after me and then what ? " I stopped and he came toward me slowly , looking me up and down , his fat red face fixed and his small eyes rising and falling in his head and then fastening on my face . " Where you come from , boy ? " he said . " Valdosta , " I told him " You do n't talk like a Georgia boy . " " No , sir , " I said . " My family has n't been in Georgia very long . " " Your family , " he said , " who 's your family ? " " My pa and ma and my sister Jenny , and her husband and their boy , my nephew . He 's three years old . " " Where do you live in Valdosta ? " " On the highway , on number eighty-four , just back in from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minute I said it , that was a mistake . It came from getting too confident . If he asked me what bar-h-q stand , I was licked . But he was n't so quick on the uptake . He was just a dumb cop and all he did was keep plodding along . " What you doing here ? " he asked . " I wanted to see what Waycross looked like , " I said . " I hitched a ride in and I want to get back home to-night or tomorrow morning early . I have n't got the fare back or the price of supper and I thought if I did some work in here he 'd give me a bowl of soup . " " Hitched ? " he said . " That ai n't Georgia talk . " " No , sir , " I said , " my family just come into Georgia not long ago from Harrisburg , Pa . " He asked me a lot more questions and I answered him and he thought over the answers and at last he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother your kind as long as you keep moving . " " Yes , sir , " I said . " You 're a nice looking fellow , " he said , " and I do n't want to have to lay this across your mouth . " He touched the butt of his gun . " Yes , sir , " I said . " I do n't want any trouble . All I want is to get home . " " All right , git . " " Thank you , your honor , " I said and went through the door , the fellow and his girl watching me , that one-armed counter-man watching me and the cop watching me . I felt more like a plain no-good bum than I had ever felt . I went along for a few blocks , taking every corner until I thought I had lost the cop . Maybe they got a mission house in this town , I thought , maybe they got a Salvation Army , but how am I going to find out , who am I going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street is likely to feel , " We got to be rough on bums or they 'll be loading us down all winter ; we got to keep ' em moving " ? Besides , this town looked too small for a mission house . I do n't care , I thought , I 'm not going to go through anything like last night again if it costs me the rest of my life on a chain gang . While I walked looking , seeing the drugstores , seeing people eat ice cream and sandwiches and a man chewing a bar of candy , I kept thinking about this one-armed fellow and how he had a job and plenty to eat . Any time he wanted , I thought , he could fry himself a hamburger or dish himself a bowl of chili and eat so much , any time lie felt like , that his belt would cut into his belly and he 'd have to loosen his pants . God Almighty ! I 'd give up an arm for that kind of life , I thought . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fork to lift with it ? I 'd give up two arms and my legs too . If I just kept getting enough to eat , I would n't want to walk any more . I would n't want to do anything . I could n't imagine any kind of life better than just lying still waiting to get hungry enough to eat . Meat and potatoes , that was the stuff . Oatmeal and eggs and ham steak and pancakes and sausages for breakfast , meat and potatoes and soup for lunch , meat and potatoes and soup for supper and maybe you would feel like eating some more in the middle of the day and you would just fry up a hamburger and onions for yourself on a soft roll with warm gravy all over the roll , dripping on your fingers , or maybe break open a can of salmon or beans and then , before going to bed , cold chicken leg with some cold boiled potatoes , putting salt on them and just tossing them into your mouth whole and all cold from the icebox . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and legs to live a life like that . I saw another eatery and I started looking in to size up the joint , when I noticed a car pull up and looked around and there was the cop sitting there looking at me . " Hello , " I said . I tried to smile at him . It was kind of funny , Mr. Jinx riding around after me in a car . But he did n't smile back and I began to walk again , down the street , at a good fast pace . I could feel gas blowing up my stomach and I thought , that 's fine , at least I got something in there . And I could feel the skin riding up and down my ribs as my arms swung . I knew I 'd have to go out of town now and sneak back later for a freight , but every time I thought of last night and living through two nights like last night in a freight , I got so scared I felt weak . I was in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , I 'll just have to take a chance , that 's all . The way I felt then , ten years on a chain gang could n't add up in suffering to another night without food . There was one house with a " tourists " sign on the lawn , a brick house , and I walked around the back , up a few wooden steps , and rang a bell . The bell worked . That was a good sign . When a house is kept up so well even the back bell works it means there 's money in it . I took my hat off . I could feel my head pounding and echoing and making a surprising amount of noise in this still , dark , backyard world . I stood there a long time , tasting a sweetness in the air , feeling the back of my neck grow cool where wet hair touched it , seeing the cracked white paint on the door . It was so quiet there . 1 could even hear the cool , sweet breeze go through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid , slow , timid , and a high rattle of a voice said , " Who 's there ? " " Meat ' spection service , " I said . I said it fast so she could n't understand the words and would think it must be something official and open the door . " What ? " she said . I had a sinking feeling . I could n't talk through a closed door . I could n't holler into all this silence that I was hungry and wanted something to eat . " Emergency service , ma'am , " I said . I tried to make my voice sound official and disinterested , but it came out all ragged . " What do you want ? " she said . " I did n't send for anybody . " She sounded frightened . I made my mistake not going around to the front like a tourist . Then she 'd have opened the door and I might have had a chance . " I want something to eat , ma'am , " I said . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat . " I did n't hear anything for a long time . I thought she was going to pull a surprise and open the door after all . " Go away , " she said at last , " or I 'll call the police . Coming around here this hour of the night . " " Yes , ma'am , " I said . " I 'll go away . I 'm just hungry . " But she had n't waited to hear me . I could hear her walking off to the front of the house before I started to answer . I went down the steps and along the side of the house toward the street and I sawher standing with the mouthpiece of the telephone covering her lips . A tall , pale , gray , frightened-looking woman , her face wrinkled and soured . Hundred-dollara-month old maid schoolteacher , I thought , trying to keep up a big house by taking in tourists and not having much luck in this out-of-the-way neighborhood . Then suddenly it hit me that she must be talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raiding back doors . I wanted to pick up a brick and throw it right through that nice , clean , shining window , past the nice , white , lace curtains , and crack her skull with it . I even thought how thin her skull looked , the skin on it blued like watered milk , and what that rattling voice would sound like in a scream . Then I wanted just to sit still on the curb in front of the house and when the cops came they 'd find me with my head hanging down between my knees and they 'd say , " This guy is just pooped out , that 's all . " But , I thought , maybe they got a gauntlet in this town . Maybe they give vags six months on the gang . Maybe they 'll work me over and try to get me to own up to every unsolved job of thieving and stabbing and raping in the neighborhood for the last thirty years . No , I thought , not I started to run . I came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperately on tiptoe . Then I got hold of myself . " What 's the best thing ? " 1 thought . " Think of the best thing to do . If I keep going I 'll stick out all over these deserted streets . If I hide , if they find me hiding somewhere , then they 'll feel for sure I 'm a crook . I 've got a minute to do something . Do something ! What ? What ? " I was around the corner now and I walked up to the front door of the first house that had a light in it and rang the bell . I figured that was my best chance . If I got in , all right . If I did n't , well , at least they 'd find me on a front porch and know I could n't be out stealing . The bell did n't work . I knocked on the warped frame of the rusty , torn screen door and waited , thinking , I 'll tell whoever comes to the door just what happened and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will change . Maybe I 'll get a feed out of it . " You poor boy ! " I could hear her saying it . " You poor boyl " But she 'd have to come fast . Seconds now , seconds now . I could just see that radio car sneaking up , lights out , Mr. Jinx in it . It would be Mr. Jinx . A town like this would have only one cop on car patrol at night . I pulled open the screen door and rapped on the wooden door inside . It swung open a little bit . I stepped back , frightened . I never expected anything like that . I could see a block of light splitting out from the open door and I heard a deep , snoring sound behind the door , a struggle of breath . Somebody sleeping , I thought . I knocked on the door as loud as I dared in that quiet neighborhood . Too loud , I 'll have the whole town on my neck . " Hello , " I said , " anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked in and in the middle of the room , right before my eyes , a fellow was sitting at a round , bare , fumed oak table , his long , thin body hunched over a cup , his nose stuck almost into the cup , breathing deep , sucking up the fumes . I could smell the sharp , spicy odor of tincture of benzoin . He was sitting sideways to the door and he never even looked around when I walked in . He heard me . I knew he heard me , but he was past bothering . He kept his face over the cup and sucked up the fumes in long , deep , struggling snores . I once knew a lady who breathed like that when she got an asthmatic attack , but she had an atomizer that she stuck into her nose and worked when it happened . This stuff in the cup was new to me , but I thought it must be asthma because he had a look of such tired intensity . He looked like he thought if he pulled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would strangle to death . I walked in slowly and closed the door . My breath came tight . It had given me such a turn to come upon him all of a sudden like that . The house was soquiet I knew we must be alone in it . It began to feel spooky with the clock ticking on the mantelpiece and a cat standing stiff and silent in the corner , staring at me round-eyed , soundless , its back at the beginning of an arch , and this tall , thin dark man with a sunken face , sad and terrified as he struggled for breath over a cup . I came around in front of him . " I 'm in a hell of a jant , " I said . It sounded like the wrong thing . What the hell was he in if not a hell of a jam ? But I could n't get used to the idea that he was too sick to worry about me . I felt I had to explain how I came in . " I stopped at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and asked for something to eat and the Iady there called the cops . Now I do n't know what to do . I give you my word that 's all I did . " He looked at me once in an exhausted , indifferent way and then he turned his eyes downward into the cup . I could see he was n't even thinking about what I had said . I did n't even know if he had heard me , what with the rasping of the air through his nose and the long convulsive heaves of his chest , but even if he had heard , I was sure he had n't taken it in . " I do n't want to bother you at a time like this , " I said . I looked around and saw that the kitchen was just in back . The tip of the icebox  --  a nice , shiny frigidaire  --  stuck out and I thought , " There 's cold meat and potatoes in a nice icebox like that . He ca n't do anything to me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't move away from that cup . He ca n't even let out a holler . Here 's where I get fed and slip out and the hell with him . " I went a little crazy at the thought of being so close to food . I wanted to get tough with him . I had to hold myself in to keep my voice soft . " Mister , I see you 're in trouble , " I said . " But I 'm in trouble too . I 'm starving . I 'm crazy with hunger . Can I go in the icebox and get myself something ? " He did n't answer me . He was too in-tent on his breathing . I felt violently angry . " You big damn fool , " I thought , " do n't you know I got you by the short hairs ? Do n't you know that all I got to do is pull that cup away from your nose and I got you ? I can kill you . " I felt all choked up with hate and anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I told him . 1 did n't know how long his attack was going to last , but I did n't care any more . I walked into the kitchen . I had just time to open the icebox when I heard heavy steps running up the porch and heard the door creak open . " I do n't want to get caught here , " I thought . " If that 's somebody from the family , I 'll come out saying I 've been hunting up something to help him . Water , a wet cloth for his head to make him feel easier . " I swung in line with the door and looked out and saw this cop  --  my Mr. Jinx ? standing there with his mouth open , his face stricken , as he looked pityingly at the suffering man . " You got another attack , Mr. Dunfee ? " he said . I stood still , afraid to move , afraid to make a sound by ducking back out of sight . I knew if this cop saw me now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself out of it . With any other cop , I might have had a chance , but not with Mr. Jinx . I hoped if I stood still maybe he 'd get overcome with decency and back out and go away . " Mrs. Dunfee gone to telephone for the doctor , " he said , " or shall I call one ? " He was a plodder all right , that cop , a big dumb plodder . Mr. Dunfee did n't answer and I stood there waiting , breath . ing through my open mouth so that the cop should hear no noise because if he lifted his eyes he 'd see me . I was right in line with him . " There 's a suspicious character around here , " the cop said , after a while , " and Miss Wilson says she saw him go in here . " The cop 's eyes wavered around the room . Then they landed full on mine and I saw him go gray all over . I saw the blood drain out of his face and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the shock of seeing me standing there in the gloom , silent , open-mouthed , not moving . I guess I just lost my head . I turned and ran . Four steps to the kitchen door . If that door was locked I 'd die . It was n't . Luck , luck , I had some luck . I tore it open , slammed it shut behind me to give me a little start , and ran down the steps and out across the lawn . " Stop ! Stopl " yelled the cop . I put my head down and ran faster . I ran like a rabbit , going through a hedge so fast I hardly felt it and then he put a bullet into the air over my head . Baml A big roar of sound driving through the night like a fist .

I had thought it beneath the meanest thief on earth . ' " The warden looked at me a long time . I could tell that nothing I would say or do would be right . " You try mean stuff up here , " he said at last , " and I 'll peel your hide with my fingers . Remember , bub , before you start anything mean , we got seventeen years to work on you .
