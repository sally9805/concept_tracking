Last autumn the Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank was stayed from foreclosing a $9,000 mortgage on William W. Radford 's 170-acre Kentucky farm by a brand-new device for scaling down farm debts and forestalling foreclosures-the Frazier-Lemke Act , a non-Administration measure filibustered to passage by Senator Huey P. Long in the last days of the 73rd Congress . That law permitted a farmer to declare himself bankrupt and keep his farm by having its current value appraised , then paying this sum to his creditors within five years . Farmer Radford got his debt scaled down to $4,445 , arranged to pay $325 rental for the first year . Charging a rape of its rights , the Louisville Land Bank went to law , was twice rebuffed by Federal Courts . Last week the U. S. Supreme Court reversed those rulings , unanimously held the Frazier-Lemke Act unconstitutional . <P> No die-hard reactionary Justice , but famed Liberal Louis Dembitz Brandeis read the opinion . Prime point : in depriving a creditor of his just property the Act clearly violated the Constitution 's " due process of law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared : <P> " We have no occasion to consider either the causes or the extent of farm tenancy ; or whether its progressive increase would be arrested by the provisions of the Act . Nor need we consider the occupations of the beneficiaries of the legislation . These are matters for the consideration of Congress . "
