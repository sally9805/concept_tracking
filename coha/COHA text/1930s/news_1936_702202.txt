txt William F. Bleakley , the Republican candidate for Governor , ended a vigorous campaign last night at an open air meeting at Lexington Avenue and 116th Street with a final plea for the overthrow of the New Deal in the State . The candidate , as well as his campaign managers , expressed confidence that he would win . Earlier in the evening he had closed his radio campaign with a fifteen-minute speech over WABC and a State hook-up of the Columbia chain . He went over , in general terms , his objections to the New Deal and the administration of Governor Lehman , pledging that a Republican victory would mean " far less theatricalism in Albany and more constructive administration . " Promise of Tax Cut " I feel , " the candidate declared , " that it will be quite possible to bring about tax reductions , and I feel that this can be accomplished without reducing or impairing essential services rendered by the State . In fact , some of these services should and will be extended . I would say that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " However , I must , of necessity , qualify this tax reduction promise if the New Deal should be returned to office for another four years , or in the event of any other national catastrophe . " This qualification is necessary because no one knows what the New Deal might do , and its fiscal , currency and legislative policies have already proven so erratic as to shake public confidence and to make people wonder what it will do next . Weird national policies would , naturally , throw attempted State tax reductions out of the window , as would war or other disasters . " Between 10,000 and 15,000 persons , the police estimated , heard Mr. Bleakley 's final speech in Harlem . To accommodate the crowd , loud-speakers were installed along 116th Street for a block in either direction from the platform . Mr. Bleakley sounded a new note in his campaign when he recalled before his audience in the ItalianAmerican neighborhood that the Roosevelt administration had refused war materials to Italy in the Ethiopian campaign . " You know who it was that ap- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " You know who it was that withheld oil from her and - asoline . All I say is that we had no right to interfere in the affairs of another nation , and I ask you to bear that in mind tomorrow when you vote . " After completing his schedule last night Mr. Bleakley went to his home in Yonkers in order to be near the polling place at which he will cast his vote early this morning . Mr. Bleakley was annoyed yesterday by reports that a bodyguard of twenty men had been assigned to him aecause of the receipt of threatening letters . " I have received no threatening letters , " he said , " ar4 I want no bodyguard . As a matter of fact , I will not have one . " The candidate 's aides , however , were perturbed by the letters and several guards who remained as inconspicuous as possible stood a cautious watch over him during the day and evening . The letters , it was said , had called upon him to cease his attacks upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the candidate and the guard was established without his knowledge . The guards included New York detectives and special deputies from Westchester County . Mr. Bleakley 's radio speech was the major one of the day . He also spoke before 1,000 persons at the Curtis High School , St. George , S. I. , and before 1,500 persons at the Julia Richman High School , on Sixty-seventh Street between Second and Third Avenues , but in these , as in his closing one in Harlem , he departed only slightly from the radio address . " Annexation " by New Deal " Who can deny , " the candidate asked , " that the continuation in office of the Federal New Deal party and the re-election of my opponent can only result in the more complete annexation of New York State to the New Deal 's rattling chariot ? " This would mean , he said , " the complete subordination of the people of this State to the will of New Deal purveyors of planned scarcities , planned industrialism , planned regimentation , planned socialism , planned New Realism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , perhaps , fascism . " Mr. Bleakley once again declared that Governor Lehman had not answered the questions he had propounded during the campaign . " I regret he has not answered these questions , " he said . " I regret to see the Governor of a great State either unwilling or unable to reply to well-considered and relevant interrogation . " The Republican candidate reiterated the stand he took at the outset of the campaign , that he would not seek to " coerce " the Legislature into doing his bidding . It was upon this point that Governor Lehman attacked him , suggesting that the Republican candidate would be " supine " before the Legislature instead of fighting for legislation in which he , or the people , were interested . " I will recommend to the Legislature , " Mr. Bleakley said , " but I will not seek to transform that body into a rubber stamp and faint echo of my own voice . " Mr. Bleakley closed his speech by expressing thanks to campaign and party workers and to others connected , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
