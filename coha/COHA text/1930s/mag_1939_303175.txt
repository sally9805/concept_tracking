Only competitor now in sight : American Export Airlines , which has not yet made its first exploration flight . <P> With 400 on its passenger waiting list , Pan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the provisions of CAA 's order was for five flights with mail only , so that Pan Am 's crews will be thoroughly familiar with the run before the first passenger run ( capacity : 40 ) is made .
