Living room in the Secretary of State 's home , washington , D. C. It is a cluttered , homelike room  --  not " done " in any particular period , but a mixture of three generations . Charming , old-fashioned . Solid American . Dominating the room is the portrait of a vigorous , middle-aged man , painted somewhere around the turn of the century . Somehow you sense that from this old fellow have stemmed the family traditions and position . Across a hall at the rear you get a glimpse of the dining room , set for tea with silver service , candles , flowers , etc . Two butlers fuss around it , appearing , disappearing . After a moment there enters an attractive , poised woman , somewhere in her thirties . Her name is SOPHY PRESCOTT . She brings a little stack of ash receivers and scatters them around the room , replacing others obviously more valuable . That done , she calls to the senior butler . PRESCOTT Charles ! CHARLES Yes , Miss Prescott ? PRESCOTT ( Handing him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? CHARLES Yes 'm . PRESCOTT If they must have souvenirs let them steal these . I 'm not going to have them carrying off bits of jade and ivory , the way they usually do . p. 3 CHARLES I always try to watch , Miss , but there are so many ladies . PRESCOTT I know , Charles . ( She peers into a cigarette box ) Where are those cigarettes the Persian Minister sent ? We must have those out where he can see them . CHARLES Right there , Miss . And I put Egyptians in the other compartment , in case the Egyptian Minister comes . PRESCOTT That was very diplomatic , Charles . Well , we 're all ready . Smilax , Egyptians , Persians , souvenir ash trays , tea table , candles  --  all we need is a hostess . Charles , was that all that Mrs. Wayne said ? Just that she was at the Senate ? CHARLES Yes , Miss . Listening to Senator Keane 's speech . PRESCOTT ( Furiously , as she takes up the telephone ) Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( There enters a soft and fluffy young woman  --  very young , nave , Southern . EMMY PAIGE ) PAIGE ( Very , very Southern ) Is n't Aunt Lucy home yet ? PRESCOTT Oh , Charles ! Edward should be on the door soon . Or maybe you 'd better let Edward help you and put one of the caterer 's men on the door  --  that oldish one with the mole on his chin . ( To EMMY ) You know , he looked so unappetizing at the Herricks ' dinner last night , but it wo n't matter at the door . p. 4 PAIGE Oh , I know the on you mean . You know , it took me the longest time to figure out why everybody in Washington had a butler with a mole on his chin . Then I found out it was the same one . PRESCOTT Hello ! Capitol ? Senate Press , please . PAIGE ( Purling on ) I declare , some of them are such distinguished-looking men , and you meet ' em at everybody 's parties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butlers or some old Senator . I do n't see how you every tell . PRESCOTT ( Through her teeth ) The butlers do n't talk . Hello ! Mr. Halloran ? This is Sophy Prescott . Thank you , just fine . Mr. Halloran , would you look over at the Senators ' gallery and see if Mrs. Wayne has left ? I think she 's listening to Senator Keane 's speech . PAIGE I do n't see how Aunt Lucy can sit in that old Senate all the time . I 'd think she 'd just scr-ream ! I was talking to Paul Starrett about her and he says she knows what those old Senators are saying when they do n't even know themselves . He says  --  PRESCOTT Hello ! Oh , she 's still there ? Well , how long has Senator Keane been speaking ? I seeWell , if he does stop , will you tell Mrs. Wayne to come right home ? That she 's wanted hereNo , nothing serious . Just tell her to come home . Thank you so much . ( She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing serious ! Nothing but the official day at home of the wife of the Secretary of State , that 's all ! Nothing but that any minute everybody in Washington will be pouring in here , from ex-Presidents ' widows to Armenian atrocities ! And those damnable delegates ! Oh , how I hate delegates ! p. 5 PAIGE What delegates ? PRESCOTT The Women 's Peace , Purity and Patriotism League , God bless their homes ! I wish they 'd stay in ' em ! PAIGE Oh , I know the ones you mean . They were having lunch at the Mayflower today  --  they all had on big red , white and blue sashes . PRESCOTT Those are the ones . PAIGE Paul Starrett says to look at them patriotism must be a awful healthy profession . Only he says they have to be pretty big for all those medals . PRESCOTT Look here  --  where have you been seeing Paul Starrett so much ? PAIGE We just had lunch to-day . Sometimes we have lunch , and he tells me funny stories about people . PRESCOTT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Innocently ) Huh ? PRESCOTT You tell him funny stories about your Aunt Lucy ? PAIGE Why , Sophy , I do not . PRESCOTT I knew it . I knew it the minute I picked up that column of his this morning . With Lucy 's remark about Irene Hibbard being the Ten Least-Dressed Women in Washington . p. 6 PAIGE Well , Aunt Lucy did say it , and everybody laughed . She says terrible wrong things , and people always laugh . PRESCOTT But she says them at the right time , Emmy , and to the right people . PAIGE Well , down in Mississippi everybody tells everybody everything , and nothing happens except once in a while somebody shoots somebody . PRESCOTT Well , if that 's all they did here PAIGE I declare I think Washington 's awful confusin ' . All that about where you sit , and who sits next to who  --  I do n't see how you ever learned it . Aunt Lucy says you 're the best secretary in Washington . She says if it was n't for you she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as she does now , probably  --  whatever she feels like . PAIGE That 's what Paul Starrett said . He thinks Aunt Lucy is the most glamorous woman  --  he says he does n't see how she has a niece like me . I mean , he thinks she 's so young-looking . PRESCOTT Oh , I see . PAIGE So I said , I 'm just her niece by marriage , and he said , Oh , that was how it happened . PRESCOTT Well , Emmy , please do n't tell him anything more . Especially not about your aunt and Irene Hibbard. p. 7 PAIGE He says Aunt Lucy and Mrs. Hibbard are the two most glamorous women in Washington , and no wonder they 're enemies . ( She sighs deeply ) I wish I knew how you got glamorous . I remember when I first heard Uncle Stephen was engaged to Lucy Chase , I like to died it was so glamorous !

( Obviously disappointed ) Yes , this is Miss Prescott . No , just the same list the evening papers have . Why , it was certainly sent to you at the Herald , Miss Jones . Well , you might mention the Women 's Peace , Purity and Patriotism League  --  the Secretary of State and Mrs. Wayne are particularly happy to have them as guests to-day . Why , she 's wearing  --  ( She looks at her watch ; makes a quick decision )  --  she 's wearing Pompeian crepe . PAIGE ( In a quick whisper ) Oh , no ! PRESCOTT ( Silencing her with a wave of the hand ) That 's right  --  the same one she wore at the Pan-American reception . With the emerald pendant . Yes , it is nice . It was a gift to her from the Latin-American Republics when her grandfather was in the White House . Not at all , Miss Jones . ( She hangs up ) p. 8 PAIGE But she wo n't wear that gown , Sophy . PRESCOTT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rompers if I tell the newspaper women she 's going to . Really  --  I could kill her ! She 's spoiled , that 's what 's the matter with her ! Lucy Chase , the White House baby ! She 's the most maddening , self-willed , unreliable  --  ( There is the slam of a door downstairs . The eyes of both SOPHY and EMMY go to the entrance hall . CHARLES appears in the dining room doorway . For a moment they all stand waiting ) ( LUCY CHASE WAYNEcomes in . Having spent her girlhood in the White House , a hundred and twenty million people know her age , but you would never think it to look at her . She has good looks , but they are subordinate to her vitality , charm , distinction . Over the years every newspaper and magazine in America has printed her picture  --  not once , but again and again . Everything she does , everything she says , is News .

You 've arranged everything divinely ! Emmy , child , you look charming ! Thanks , Charles . I never saw so many flowers . Looks like a gangster 's funeral . ( As she gets rid of her coat ) Now , Sophy darling , do n't say it ! You 'll only be sorry , and besides I can take the words right out of your mouth . Such an unhygienic phrase , I always think . " It was all very well when you were Lucy Chase , or even Lucy Chase Wayne , " ete. , etc. ,  --  curtain lowered to denote the passing of two hours  --  " but now that you are the wife of a cabinet member "  --  Sophy , do n't look so grim  --  ca n't you ever forget you were General Prescott 's daughter ? ( She sinks onto a couch , opens an enormous bag for a cigarette ) You should n't scold me  --  I 've been saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would invent a bag you could find matches in ? p. 9 PRESCOTT Lucy , will you go up and dress ? LUCY All right , but give me a breathing spell . Sitting up in that Senate for two hours . I 've got his speech here somewhere . ( She is still delving into the bag ) Sophy , you must get me another copy of the Constitution  --  this is so ratty-looking . PRESCOTT Lucy , please ! LUCY Do you know what he was going to do , Sophy ? Keane , I mean . He was going to make a speech attacking Stephen 's treaties . If I had n't headed him offWhere 's Stephen ? Is he home yet ? PRESCOTT He ' phoned a little while ago . And there are some flowers on your dressing table . LUCY My darling old elephant  --  he never forgets . PAIGE I saw Senator Keane once . He 's right good-looking . LUCY Emmy , ask Charles to bring me some tea up in my room  --  right now , while I 'm dressing . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On her way ) I remember him . Gordon Keane . He 's the Boy Senator from that old State out West . LUCY Must you talk in captions , Emmy ? p. 10 PAIGE Well , I expect he would n't be a boy anywhere but in the Senate  --  I mean not in the movies . Because most Senators are pretty near as old as George Arliss . ( She goes ) LUCY Boy Senator ! That 's really just what he is , Sophy . I think that whole Western crowd is just using him , and Irene 's helping them to do it . But he 's not going to upset those treaties . They 're the dearest things to Stephen 's heart , and I 'm not goint to let anybody monkey with them . PRESCOTT Now , Lucy , had n't you better go easy with Keane ? Irene Hibbard is entirely too close to him . LUCY Well , she is n't as close as she was , Sophy . PRESCOTT Oh , dear ! Now what ? LUCY Well , it seems Irene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got there first . If you could have seen her face when she came into the Senate restauarant . Her nostrils positively breathed fire  --  you could have cooked crpes , suzettes over them . Just then old Senator Taylor came in and she wound up having lunch with him  --  you know , he 's a hundred and seven . They made an ideal couple . He had milk toast . PRESCOTT Lucy , when are you going to grow up ? p. 11 LUCY But the main thing is : I got him to change the speech . He did n't even mention the treaties . I watched Irene while he was talking , and she was furious . If you ask me she put him up to the whole thing . She was taking a jab at me , through Stephen . PRESCOTT You do n't really believe that . LUCY Why not ? How about that last little trick of hers  --  wrecking my dinner party by kidnapping that foul little royal jackass  --  my guest of honor three hours late , all because her car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was n't all that broke down . PRESCOTT All right , all right , Lucy . But wo n't you go up now ? LUCY You know , there 's something behind this Keane business , Sophy . She 's pushing him right into her crowd  --  every chance she gets . And this speech to-day . There 's something behind it . By the way , look out for him this afternoon , if I 'm tied up when he gets here . PRESCOTT When who gets here ? LUCY Keane , of course . PRESCOTT He 's coming here ? LUCY Of course he is  --  what do you think I 've been doing ? I want Stephen to talk to him  --  we 've got to get him into our camp . p. 12 PRESCOTT Does Irene know he 's coming here ? LUCY I hope so . I devoutly hope so . Well ! ( A move as though to go ; stops again as she sees a little pile of cards on the table ) What 's all this ? PRESCOTT Just flowers . LUCY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , roses ; Senator and Mrs. Waldron , roses ; the Minister of Portugal and Madame De Silva roses ; , Seor Don Claudio Lozano  --  oh , yes , Bolivia  --  roses ; Representative and Mrs. Button , roses ; Dr. Radomir Lopavitch , roses  --  ( STEPHEN WAYNE has appeared in the doorway . Of thoroughly dignified yet pleasing appearance . That bit of gray at the temples ) Stephen , Darling ( She kisses him ) And another for your flowers . ( Kisses him again ) I have n't seen them yet , but I know they 're not roses . STEPHEN ( As SOPHY makes a discreet withdrawal ) Well ? All ready for the great invasion ? LUCY Stephen dear , you look tired . That miserable State Department is wearing you out . What was it  --  those French and English again ? p. 13 STEPHEN Oh , it 's not as bad as all that . LUCY But it is . They began ' phoning you at six o'clock this morning  --  I heard it . And it was the same yesterday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't forget when it 's six o'clock in Washington it 's already eleven in London . You ca n't blame the British for the change in time . LUCY Well , let them stay up later or something . Why does it always have to be you ? STEPHEN It 's only for a little while . This is a special occasion . LUCY It 's always a special occasion . You 've worn your working clothes every day this week . ( A gesture toward his cutaway and striped trousers ) You know what we 're going to do ? The minute those treaties are signed we 're going away some place  --  just you and I  --  some place where there are n't any foreigners or any Americans . STEPHEN What 'll you do about cables ? LUCY Cables ? What do they say , anyhow ? " Love and kisses  --  Mussolini . " " Wish you were here  --  Haile Selassie . " We 'll go where they ca n't find you . STEPHEN ( With a little laugh ) I 'm afraid there 's no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You ca n't live without them . p. 14 LUCY Darling , I do n't really care about anything in the world but you , and you know it . ( She kisses him ) And that reminds me  --  I think I 've got a new Senator for you . You 've got to be very nice to him . Tell him you heard he made a good speech this afternoon . STEPHEN Did he ? LUCY Wonderful  --  I practically wrote it . STEPHEN Now , darling , I do wish you 'd give up ghost-writing for Senators . You know it always gets you into trouble . LUCY But you ca n't let Senators write their own speeches . STEPHEN Well , give them a chance once in a while . Remember what happened with the soldiers ' bonus , when you almost disrupted the Navy by getting old Senator Whozis to come out for a sailors ' bonus ? LUCY Well , I still think it was a good idea . They work so much harder than the soldiers  --  polishing that brass all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to pay the bonus . STEPHEN Oh , I 'm sure you had it all worked out . LUCY Well , it really was n't bad . The Navy liked it  --  remember Norfolk ? They were going to give me a salute of twenty-two guns . p. 15 STEPHEN Yes , that would have been fine . One more than they give the President . LUCY Oh , he never would have known it . He always has his fingers in his ears . STEPHEN No , Lucy , the more I think about it the more I think you 'd better give up your official writing career . You 're really safer with a sword than with a pen . LUCY Well , if you want the country to go to the dogs . STEPHEN You know , it 's really a good thing you were n't around when the Constitution was written . Lord knows what you 'd have done to that . LUCY Well , if I had been it would n't need so much work to-day . Darling , why do n't you lie down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look so tired . I 'll bet you did n't have a bite of lunch , did you ? STEPHEN Yes , I did . LUCY What ? One of those brought-in sandwiches ? STEPHEN Not at all . I had lunch with the President . LUCY Really ? What did he say ? STEPHEN Nothing . LUCY Now , Stephen , he could n't have a whole lunch and say nothing . p. 16 STEPHEN Well , he  --  said it was a nice day . Asked after you  --  LUCY Stephen , you 're so aggravating . You only tell me the things you want me to know . STEPHEN Well , that 's all we tell Great Britain . LUCY Really , it 's terrible being married to the Secretary of State . His whole business is not telling things . STEPHEN I 'd tell you anything I could , Lucy . You know I want to tell you everything . LUCY ( Suddenly serious ) Then why do n't you ? STEPHEN ( Taken aback ) What ? LUCY Oh , I do n't mean state secrets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Because I know , Stephen  --  I feel it . It was about you , was n't it ? He wants you to succeed him . We 've never talked about it , Stephen  --  all these years . It 's been  --  too deep down to talk about . Whenever anybody 's mentioned it  --  you 're being President , I mean  --  we 've just laughed . We 've never really talked about it . STEPHEN ( With quiet dignity ) And we never must talk about it , Lucy . p. 17 LUCY But I want to talk about it , Stephen . I want you to have it . So much . You 've worked so hard , Stephen . You 've been so good . You are so good . ( STEPHEN looks at her for a moment , the ghost of a smile on his lips . Then he leans forward and kisses her , ever so gently ) STEPHEN Do you want it so very much , my dear ? LUCY Oh , not for myself . It 'd be no treat for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for you , Stephen-for you and the country . They need you , Stephen . STEPHEN Oh , I think they 'll stagger along , even without me . But I appreciate your giving me the nomination . I 'd rather be your choice than the people 's , any day . ( SOPHY re-enters , bringing two or three boxes containing corsages ) PRESCOTT Do you want to take a look at these ? LUCY What ? Oh , for me ? ( She gathers up one of the offerings ; inspects the card ) His Excellency ! Paying the war debt in orchids . STEPHEN ( As he goes ) He 's got to send a hell of a lot of them . LUCY ( Bringing out an enormous spray of gardenias , tied with a red-white-and-blue ribbon with gold letters ) Oh , my God , Sophy ! What 's this ? p. 18 PRESCOTT It 's from the W.P.P.P. , and you 've got to wear it . LUCY ( Scanning the card ) Peace , Purity and Patriotism . They 're coming ! PRESCOTT In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Capitol just teemed with them this morning-they were riding herd on all the Senators . Their president was a large , dovey lady , an absolute symbol of peace-I suppose this is she- ( She reads the cards ) Mrs. Louella May Creevey Creevey , Sophy . ( The door bell rings ) ( A butler passes along the hallway ) PRESCOTT Now , you see ! And nobody on the door yet ! Lucy , will you go ? LUCY Yes , darling . But it 's only Belle Hardwick or some other tea pourer . I wo n't be five minutes . PRESCOTT Well , hurry up ! And by the way , you 're wearing your Pompeian . LUCY Who said so ? PRESCOTT I said so . To the newspaper women . And I 'm not going to have those girls on my neck again . LUCY It 's too absurd . Ca n't I even wear what I want ? p. 19 PRESCOTT Not when I 've already told the newspapers . LUCY ( Resigned ) Oh , very well . If I 've gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picks up the Creevey flowers ) But surely I do n't have to put this on ? PRESCOTT You certainly do . Those women would never forgive you . LUCY All right , General Prescott . If you want me to look like Arlington on Decoration Day ! ( She presses the flowers to her bosom as she departs ) ( CHARLES comes in , bearing a great stack of flower boxes ) PRESCOTT NO , Charles ! NO ! ( He takes them out again ) ( The first reception guests arrive . They are , as LUCY has predicted , a couple of assistant tea pourers-by name MRS . BELLE HARDWICK and MRS . MARY IVES . The former is an ample woman somewhere in her fifties ; MRS . IVES is younger ) BELLE Hello , Sophy darling ! I see we 're the first ones . MRS . IVES Where 's your tea party ? Hello , Sophy ! PRESCOTT Oh , I 'm so glad it 's you . How are you , Belle ? Hello , Mary . p. 20 BELLE Where 's Lucy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute . Thank heavens for you nice dependable women . MRS . IVES You know , I 'd like just once to get to one of Lucy 's parties after she does . BELLE Well , I 'm always early . Just an old Washington war-horse minding her protocol and precedence . I was n't a White House child ; I have n't got any of that fiendish Chase charm , so I have to be early . I have to call and be called upon . Do you know how many calling cards I used last year ? Five thousand ! ( She picks up a cigarette with brilliant red tips-the Egyptian contribution ) Do n't you love these red tips ? If Tom gets the Senate again this Fall I 'm going to relax for six years and order some of these . MRS . IVES ( Reading the printed words on one of the cigarettes ) " Le Khedive . Alexandria , Egypt . " BELLE You could use them , Mary-Cabinet members do n't run for office . But our State ! My dear , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you can shake a stick at , but their politicians ' home lives must be pure . Caesar 's wife was a hussy compared to what a Senator 's wife from our State has to be . If I smoked these at home , Tom would lose the election sure . Oh , well ! I have n't done anything I wanted to for thirty-five years . I 've been running for office , first with father and then with Tom Hardwick , till my tongue 's hanging out . p. 21 PRESCOTT You love it , Belle-you know you do . And you love all this Washington thing-that 's why you do it so beautifully , and why you 'll be coming back here , Allah be praised , long after people have stopped voting for Tom . BELLE Oh , no . I 'll never come back here an " ex " - anything . If I get carried out of Washington in a ballot box I 'm going to stay out . What do you want me to do this afternoon , Sophy ? PRESCOTT Oh , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right out again . BELLE I suppose everybody 'll be here-especially the foreigners . They always turn out for Lucy the way they do for a royal funeral . MRS . IVES Yes , the State Department has all the luck . All I get on my days are post-office officials and Congressmen 's wives . BELLE Me too . ( ANN FORRESTER enters . Young , attractive ; a State Department wife ) FORRESTER Oh , good , I 'm not late . ( She greets the older women ; makes the rounds gracefully ) PRESCOTT ( In the hallway ) Lucy , are n't you nearly ready ? ( She goes out ) p. 22 FORRESTER What a time ! I 've been packing Wallace to go down the bay and meet the President of Haiti , and you ca n't imagine what it means . His boat reaches Quarantine at an ungodly hour-that means a sack suit to meet the boat in , and changing to cutaway on the train for the reception at the station . If I 've forgotten anything it practically means war , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MRS . IVES You should n't be nervous after the way you handled the Abyssinians last summer . They do n't come any blacker than that . FORRESTER That nightmare ! Ninety-eight in the shade , Wallace in his morning coat , and the Abyssinian Prince in simple leopard skins and diamonds.You know , I just love this room . There are just three rooms in Washington that have real American atmosphere  --  the little old Supreme Court chamber  --  I do n't know why they ever left it-and the Blue Room at the White House , and this . And I think I like this best of all . MRS . IVES It 's that portrait of old President Chase . Somehow he 's still presiding . FORRESTER Well , that 's part of it , of course . ( Her eyes linger on it for a moment ) You know , Mrs. Wayne has that same look around the eyes , has n't she ? Or rather , behind the eyes . But of course she gets her beauty from her mother . That heavenly portrait in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if ever there was one . MRS . IVES I wish I 'd been here then . She must have been a very clever woman . BELLE Mm . She handled the old President like nobody 's business . And she had something else besides cleverness . Kindness . It 's a combination that 's rare in Washington -- cleverness and kindness . But it makes wonderful hostesses . FORRESTER What makes us so unkind , anyhow ? I suppose nobody else lasts here long enough to feel that it really matters . The whole place shifting with every administration . You know the people you meet are n't going to be here a couple of years from now , and you are n't either . So why bother ? MRS . IVES But it 's a lot of fun while you are here . Of course , it 's a lot like home in some ways -- every bit as hick , really , and always a feud going on , with everybody in town lining up on one side or the other . You 've got to be for either the first or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . But the difference is that everybody 's somebody here -- it puts gossip on a much higher plane , somehow . There 's a finish to it , if you know what I mean . BELLE And yet the dirt 's all there , underneath . MRS . IVES Exactly . Take Lucy and Irene , for instance . Back home they 'd just be any two Methodists , but here it 's Lucy Chase Wayne and the wife of a Supreme Court Justice . My dear , I trembled at the Roumanian Legation the other night . They just missed each other by two minutes . p. 24 FORRESTER You should have seen them up at the Capitol to-day -- nobody listened to poor Senator Keane . Every eye in the place was on the gallery . MRS . IVES What do you mean ? They were n't together , surely ? FORRESTER Heavens , no ! MRS . IVES I guess it 's one feud we can count on , year after year . What started it , anyhow ? A man ? BELLE Naturally . MRS . IVES Really ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman 's husband  --  that 's fair enough  --  everybody expects that  --  but Irene did worse . She took Lucy 's cook . And my dear , it simply is n't done . MRS . IVES Why , I never heard that . BELLE Well , that 's how it started . He was a colored chef . He made the most heavenly **27;2465;TOOLONG and roe-herringyou 'd wake up in the night dreaming about them . They made Lucy 's Sunday break-fasts the most potent political force in Washington  --  Presidents were made and unmade , right between popovers.And then Irene came along . She 'd just divorced that foreign prince of hers  --  what was his name ? p. 25 MRS . IVES Gregoravitch . BELLE That 's it . I never can remember . MRS . IVES I do n't see how you can forget . He 's always marrying somebody . He and his brothers . BELLE Anyhow , she took that house on Massachusetts Avenue , and started in to splurge with the Baker millions  --  she was born Irene Baker in Mansfield , Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , the wrong kind of automobile , while Henry Ford was making the right kind  --  but they made an awful lot of money before too many of them blew up . MRS . IVES Oh , I 'll never catch up on Washington . But of course I 've only been here two administrations . BELLE Well , man and boy , I 've seen eight , which makes me practically a Neanderthal woman . When you 've seen only two you think they 're different , but by the time you see eight you know they 're all alike . FORRESTER But so much happens . BELLE Yes , a lot happens , but nothing changes . No matter how big the personality it always passes . It 's Washington itself that stays . ( LUCY , finally dressed for the occasion , appears in the hallway . Charming , dignified , beautifully gowned , big bag of material blending with gown . SOPHY looms up behind her ) p. 26 LUCY I 'm so sorry , but Sophy never told me you were here . Sophy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eloquent look from SOPHY ) Belly , what a lovely hat ! BELLE Now , Lucy , relax . PRESCOTT ( Peering down the hallway ) Oh , good Lord , here they come ! Mobs of them ! LUCY Well , shut the doors  --  quick ! Mary darling , tell the Postmaster General he ought to put you on a stamp , just the way you look . Ann , Stephen tells me that Wallace is doing the most marvelous work on the Trans-Bulglania treaty . FORRESTER I 'm so glad . LUCY They 're going to send us all their caviar , and all we 're going to give them is a lot of old shoe or something . PRESCOTT ( Who has made an excursion into the next room ) Are you ready , Lucy ? The room 's filling up . LUCY Come on , girls  --  up and at em ! Belle , I want you near me . Mary , you 'd better start in the hall . You too , Ann . And remember , keep people moving . That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they go , so long as they keep moving . ( MRS . IVES and ANN open the center doors a little and squeeze through . There is a glimpse of arriving guests in the hallway ; the buzz of conversation ) Ooooh ! Sounds like a bird store ! Keep those closed  --  we 'll use this room as a haven . Sophy , do n't let that Peace and Purity woman get past me . Once I accidentally snubbed a temperance woman and it delayed repeal three years . ( She is gone  --  BELLE and the OTHERS with her ) ( Immediately a great buzz springs in the drawing room . You get a glimpse of WOMEN milling ) ( MARY IVES comes busily in from the hall ; passes through to the drawing room ) ( Then LUCY comes into view again , piloting a couple of WOMEN p. 27 LUCY Why , yes , of course you may ! That 's Grandfather 's picture right over there . A CONGRESSMAN 'S WIFE Oh , thank you , Mrs. Wayne ! Thank you ever so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you.Is n't she lovely ? I do n't believe half those stories about her , do you ? A CONGRESSMAN 'S WIFE We 'd better hurry and look around . We 'll never get a chance like this again ! THE SECOND WOMAN Just imagine who 's been in this room ! I can almost feel the vibrations ! To think of you living in Washington and meeting all these people ! I wish Henry was a Congressman ! A CONGRESSMAN 'S WIFE That 's her grandfather there . Andrew Chase . My husband says the party 's never had a man like him . THE SECOND WOMAN Where did he ever get that collar ? A CONGRESSMAN 'S WIFE Is n't it quaint ? THE SECOND WOMAN My dear , look ! ( She heads for a photograph on a table ) Queen Marie ! A CONGRESSMAN 'S WIFE ( Joining her ) Oh ! p. 28 THE SECOND WOMAN It 's signed ! " Marie R. " What 's the R. for ? A CONGRESSMAN 'S WIFE Roumania ! THE SECOND WOMAN Oh , of course ! How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears in the doorway , escorting a woman ) THE FOREIGNER ( With a bow ) Pardon , Mesdames . A CONGRESSMAN 'S WIFE ( Very friendly ) Howdy do ? THE FOREIGNER ( With a great deal of bowing ) Pardon . Pardon . ( With his lady , he withdraws again ) A CONGRESSMAN 'S WIFE I think that was the Persian minister . No -- Turkish . Anyhow , one of those rug countries . THE SECOND WOMAN He was awfully foreign , was n't he ? ( SOPHY appears , ushering in a very svelte , beautiful European ) PRESCOTT Come in here , Baroness . So good of you to come , when you 've been so ill . Why do n't you sit right down here , and I 'll have some tea brought in to you . ( As two more foreign-looking men appear ) Seor Ortega , would you be so good as to ask them to bring the Baroness ' tea in here ? p. 29 SENOR ORTEGA Oh , but I am delighted ! Baroness --  ( He kisses her hand , a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WIFE and her FRIEND )  --  vous avez t malade , j'ai entendu ? THE BARONESS Oh  --  un tout petit malaise que j'ai exager pour me rendre plus interessante , c'est ce que j'appelle faire Madame au Camelia . SENOR ORTEGA Vous dites toujours des choses si drles ! ( With a little laugh he goes out into the hall ) ( A CHINESE LADY and GENTLEMAN have entered from the hall , with much bowing to the exiting ORTEGA ) A CHINESE ( In beautiful English , with a bow to the women ) If you please . It is , to Mrs. Wayne , this way ? ( The WOMEN nod and smile  --  too much nodding , too much smiling ) Thank you . ( A deep bow ; he goes ) ( A GENERAL enters , in full uniform . A lady on his arm ) A GENERAL But there is one thing , Mrs. Davenport , that you must always remember . An army travels on its stomach . A CONGRESSMAN 'S WIFE Well , is n't that awfully uncomfortable ? p. 30 A GENERAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand me  --  ( As they go out one door ORTEGA comes through another , laden with tea things ) THE SECOND WOMAN Sally ! A CONGRESSMAN 'S WIFE Well ? THE SECOND WOMAN Remember that napkin I got at the White House ? A CONGRESSMAN 'S WIFE Yes . THE SECOND WOMAN Walk in back of me as we go out of here . ( They go , and as they do so she deftly picks up an ashtray  --  one of SOPHY 'S cheap ones , thank God  --  and slips it into her handbag ) ( ANN FORRESTER comes in from the hall . Not only that , but she is obviously escorting someone important , and is in quite a dither about it . And no wonder , for her prize is none other than Mrs. Creevey  --  Louella May Creevey to you . Mrs. Creevey is every inch a clubwoman  --  all bust , and flowers , and blue and gold sash . The minute she comes in you know you 're up against something ) FORRESTER  --  because this way you can miss all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . MRS . CREEVEY Thank you . p. 31 FORRESTER ( As MARY IVES opportunely enters ) Mary , I want you to meet Mrs. Creevey , President of the Women 's  --  ( For an awful moment she ca n't remember . Then , mercifully , it begins to come to her )  --  Peace  --  MRS . CREEVEY ( Graciously prompting ) Purity  --  FORRESTER ( With a gulp ) And Patriotism League . Mrs. Creevey , will you excuse me ? I just have to run . Mrs. Ives will look after you  --  wo n't you , Mary ? ( And she escapes ) MRS . IVES ( You can imagine how pleased ) Delighted . MRS . CREEVEY Mrs. Ives ? Mrs. Postmaster-General Ives ? MRS . IVES That 's right . MRS . CREEVEY Well , this is wonderful ! I 'm such an admirer of your husband , Mrs. Ives . As you may know , I have the honor to represent five million women , including affiliated bodies , and we are not going to rest until we make it ten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless you 've read about it  --  and we have petitioned the Postmaster-General to issue a special stamp in honor of the occasion . p. 32 MRS . IVES I 'm sure that would be most appropriate . MRS . CREEVEY I 'm so glad you think so , but the question is : What should be the design on the stamp ? The executive committee is divided  --  some think it should be a simple dove of peace , and others think it should be me . ( She laughs a little ) Since the quadri-centennial occurs during my presidency . MRS . IVES I think it would be an excellent idea . MRS . CREEVEY I 'm so glad you think so . ( She is peering into the other room ) Oh , is n't that Sir Arthur Erskine ? MRS . IVES Yes , I think it is . MRS . CREEVEY We met at Geneva last Spring  --  the disarmament conference.And here 's Senator Hardwick ! Senator Hardwick ! How fortunate ! I was looking for you at the Capitol all morning . TOM ( A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were . MRS . IVES Well , pardon me . I 'll tell Mrs. Wayne you 're here . MRS . CREEVEY ( Abstracted ) What ? Oh , yes . Now , Senator , as you know I represent six million women in forty-seven of the forty-eight States . Your own State has one of our strongest chapters , and we do so much want to support you in your campaign for re-election this Fall  --  p. 33 TOM Well , that 's very good of you . MRS . CREEVEY  --  if we can feel sure just where you stand . The question is : Whom are you going to nominate for President ? We want a man who had a mother , Senator Hardwick . The women of America , Senator  --  ( LUCY , having been duly tipped off , swoops down on Mrs. CREEVEY from the other room ) LUCY Mrs. Creevey ! So nice of you to come ! ( HARDWICK , being no fool , takes advantage of the distraction and tiptoes out of the room ) With all the terrific responsibilities that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just exuding charm at every pore ) I hear it 's the most inspiring one you 've ever had . ( Suddenly she becomes conscious of someone behind her . It is SOPHY  --  good old SOPHY  --  bringing along the floral horror from the W. P. P. P. and surreptitiously pressing it into LUCY 'S hand . LUCY recovers herself quickly and puts on a good act ) And to think of your sending me these beautiful flowers ! So lovely ! MRS . CREEVEY Oh , thank you. I 've just been telling the Senator  --  where 'd the Senator go ?  --  ( She looks around . No Senator ) oh , well !  --  that we must have a President that the six million women of the W. P. P. P. can get behind . p. 34 LUCY Well , of course that takes a big man . MRS . CREEVEY Indeed it does , Mrs. Wayne . The women of America demand such a man . The hand that rocks the cradle must also be the mailed fist . Do n't you agree with me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet you ! Baroness , may I present Mrs. Creevey ? Mrs. Creevey is behind six million women . MRS . CREEVEY No , no ! They 're behind me . LUCY I beg your pardon . This is the Baroness Orloff , Seor Ortega , M. Pavitch  --  ah , M. Protopopescu ! Quand tes vous rentrez de New York ? Baroness , c'est gentil d'etre venue , madame ! Mais la jolie robe ! Elle vous va a ravir ! And now , Mrs. Creevey , everyone is dying to meet you ! Mrs. Creevey , I do n't see how you do it ! All those women behind you ! What do they do back there , anyhow ? ( And out they go ) ( Meanwhile the BARONESS and her group are wending their way toward the hall , jabbering French as they go ) THE BARONESS A propos , que pensez vous de la note de Mussolini ? SENOR ORTEGA Cela depend . Nous ne vivons plus que de surprises en surprises . ( As they pass through the hall doors a newcomer enters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He comes into the room rather uncertainly  --  plainly , he is a stranger ) ( The GENERAL comes back , bringing that same feminine Einstein ) p. 35 A GENERAL Yes , Mrs. Davenport . In my opinion , war with Japan is inevitable . MRS . DAVENPORT Really ? Will you bring me back a kimono ? A GENERAL Certainly . I 'll have the Mikado help me pick one out . ( And they are gone ) ( The stranger peers into the drawing room ; he seems a little hesitant about entering ) ( EMMY comes out of the room ) PAIGE Oh ! You 're Senator Keane . SENATOR KEANE How do you do ? PAIGE I 'm Emmy Paige , Mrs. Wayne 's niece . I 've seen you in the Senate  --  that 's how I happened to know you . SENATOR KEANE You have a good memory . There are a lot of us up there . PAIGE Well , I 'd know you anywhere by the top of your head . Of course , sitting in the gallery and looking down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't mistake you . You 're the only one that 's got that much hair . SENATOR KEANE Well , I 'm glad I stand out some way.Tell me  --  where do I find Mrs. Wayne ? In there ? Or is this the wrong end to begin at ? PAIGE Well , I know Aunt Lucy wants to see you . I 'll try to get her . p. 36 SENATOR KEANE Thanks . I do n't know whether I 'm quite equal to plunging into that . PAIGE That 's all right . ( She goes ) ( Alone again , KEANE gives his attention to the room . Its chief attraction for him is the portrait of Andrew Chase ) ( EMMY returns  --  bringing LUCY , true to her word ) I got her . LUCY So you made it ! SENATOR KEANE Indeed I did . We adjourned early . LUCY Well , I thought the speech came off awfully well , did n't you ? I heard several very nice things about it . SENATOR KEANE I 'm glad of that . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than mine . LUCY Nonsense ! What did I do ? A little adding and subtracting.Emmy , tell Charles to bring us some tea in here . And if Belle or Mary Ives gets a minute off tell them to come in . PAIGE Yes , Aunt Lucy . LUCY And oh ! Emmy ! See if your Uncle Stephen 's down-stairs . ( As EMMY goes ) He 's probably up to his shoulder blades in peace women , but I want you two to have a talk . I know you 'll like each other . p. 37 SENATOR KEANE I 'm looking forward to it . You understand , Mrs. Wayne , I admire the Secretary very much , even if I do n't always see eye to eye with him . LUCY Well , anyhow , I want you to hear his views . We can have a nice long talk after all this crowd goes . Of course it 's rather hectic now . SENATOR KEANE ( Looking around ) You know , this is an event for me  --  sitting in this room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , was n't he ? He 's always been a sort of ideal of mine . LUCY Oh , I 'm glad . SENATOR KEANE Of course , I was only a boy when he was President  --  my father took me to hear him speak once . I could n't have been more than seven . His train came through the town and he spoke from the back platform . I 'll never forget it . LUCY I 've got some wonderful pictures of those old campaigns  --  they 're lots of fun.Oh , thank you , Charles . Just put it right here . ( The tea tray is set down ) I 'll show them to you later on.Tea ? SENATOR KEANE Yes , thanks . I suppose he must have sat here hundreds of times . Your grandfather . p. 38 LUCY Well , of course he liked Blue Hills best . I ca n't remember when we did n't live with him  --  either at Blue Hills , or Gramercy Park , or the Governor 's mansion . SENATOR KEANE It must have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LUCY Well , my father was his only child , you know , and he adored my mother . Of course , I ate it up  --  there was always something exciting going on . But it had its drawbacks  --  I was patted on the head by practically every member of the party . Maybe that 's what 's the matter with me  --  eh , Tom ? ( To HARDWICK , who has just entered ) TOM What ? Hello , Keane . How are you ? SENATOR KEANE Hello , Senator . LUCY Tom here was one of the chief head patters . ( To HARDWICK ) I was just talking about old times  --  back in the poker days . ( To KEANE again ) You know , during his second term Grandpa had the most wonderful Cabinet . They were the best poker players in America . TOM Those were the days , all right  --  the golden days of American politics . LUCY Mm . The chewing tobacco era . I 'll never forget Vice-President Merritt  --  remember , Tom ?  --  when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance from the fireplace . Of course mother had a sort of sixth sense about spittoons . It was part of her success in the White House . ( MRS . IVES enters , not a little disturbed ) p. 39 MRS . IVES Well , I put my foot in it with Mrs. Creevey . I admired a sweet little flower nestled in her jabot , and she said , " Flower ? What flower ? " Well , my dear , it turned out to be a little dab of chicken salad , with mayonnaise on it . ( BELLE HARDWICK comes in ) BELLE Well , this looks peaceful . LUCY Want a cup of tea , Belle ? BELLE I certainly do . ( She sinks into a chair ) Whew ! My poor feet ! I 've spent the whole afternoon walking around on broken English . LUCY Belle , you know Senator Keane ? SENATOR KEANE Oh , yes . How do you do , Mrs. Hardwick ? BELLE How are you , Senator ? ( SOPHY enters  --  a bit apprehensively ) LUCY Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiddling ? PRESCOTT Lucy . ( She advances and whispers to her ) LUCY ( Vastly amused ) Not really ? Here ? PRESCOTT Very much here . Ann Forrester has her in tow . p. 40 LUCY Oh , she must come right in ! Where is she ? FORRESTER Right in here , Mrs. Hibbard . ( There is a moment 's pause , and then IRENE HIBBARD enters . Born IRENE BAKER in Mansfield , Ohio , but Europe was her finishing school . She can be described only in French . Elegante , soigne , chic ) LUCY Irene ! How like you to give us this pleasure ! IRENE I 'm sorry to be so late . But I had no idea I could make it . LUCY Neither had I. IRENE ( Taking in the assemblage ) I know everyone , do n't I ? Yes . BELLE You know me . IRENE Oh , hello , Belle . Good afternoon , SophyTom , darling ! ( Her whole tone is different when she addresses a man ) I do n't see you nearly often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me a chance , Irene . IRENE ( Turning aside the compliment ) Oh , Tom ! And Gordon ! Well ! To think of finding you here ! p. 41 LUCY Yes , think of that . SENATOR KEANE Mrs. Wayne was so kind as to invite me . IRENE How sweet of her ! LUCY Wo n't you sit down , Irene ? You look tired . IRENE Thank you . ( As she settles herself her bag slips to the floor . GORDON bounds after it ) Oh , thanks , GordonYou 're looking  --  better , Lucy . LUCY Only two pounds . IRENE But it 's becoming . LUCY Thank you . IRENE ( Extracting a cigarette from a dainty case ) Have you a light , Gordon ? ( He quickly provides one ) Oh , thank you.You know , I 've been telling Gordon for weeks that he ought to come here once . I knew he 'd enjoy it . LUCY Oh , I hope you did n't force the poor man , Irene.Tea ? IRENE If you please . LUCY Crumpets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're nothing compared to those your chef makes . ( She turns to KEANE ) Irene has the most wonderful chef , Gordon . You must go there to tea some timeOnce . ( BELLE 'S cup descends on its saucer with a sudden and audible click ) ( There is a moment 's hiatus , devoted to tea-drinking and general uneasiness ) Well , this is cozy , is n't it ? ( She takes out a cigarette ; parrots IRENE 'S inflection ) Have you a light , Gordon ? ( There is a flicker from IRENE as GORDON lights LUCY 'S cigarette ) p. 42 TOM Nobody asks me for a light . I 've got a lighter , too . ( He exhibits it ) IRENE ( As the crowd grows noisy in the drawing room ) Really , it must be frightful for you to have to do this sort of thing , Lucy  --  these terrible crowds . People who do n't care anything about you , nor you about them . Politics would simply kill me . But then , I 'm too sincere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics lately , Irene . I saw you lunching with old Senator Taylor to-day  --  you were having a wonderful time . IRENE Oh , were you there ? LUCY And Senator Taylor , too  --  I never saw him so captivated . How I envy you your knack with older men . ( IRENE 'S silence is eloquent ) That reminds me , how 's your husband ? He did n't come with you , did he ? IRENE No , Carter 's busy . He 's writing a minority opinion . LUCY Again ? I 'm so sorry . IRENE Well , at least Carter can afford to express an opinion . The bench is permanent . LUCY Yes , it must give you such a comfortable feeling , like royalty , almost . But you were , almost , were n't you ? Of course ! What was that fascinating little country you lived in ? p. 43 IRENE If you mean Prince Gregoravitch 's country , it was Slovania . LUCY Of course ! ( Addressing this mainly to KEANE ) She had the most beautiful crest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that 's one thing you got out of it , anyhow , Irene . That crest . I remember when you had the place at Middleburg , how beautiful it looked on the bed linen ! Of course it left welts on the funniest places . ( STEPHEN WAYNE comes in ) STEPHEN Well ! So this is where you all are ? Hello , Belle ! Mary ! and Irene ! Well ! IRENE Stephen ! ( An impulsive arm stretches out to greet him ) You know , you 're getting more handsome every day . STEPHEN Well , you could n't be more handsome . IRENE ( Really , she did n't expect that ) Stephen ! STEPHEN Hello , Tom . Senator , glad to see you . SENATOR KEANE Mr. Secretary . STEPHEN Mrs. Wayne tells me you made a very fine speech this afternoon , Senator . I 'd like to read it . p. 44 SENATOR KEANE Oh , thanks . LUCY Yes , it was really superb . I was so glad I happened to be there to hear it . IRENE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LUCY Was n't it ? I do n't know how I happened to drop in just to-day . Intuition , I guess . IRENE Almost psychic , was n't it ? I should think Stephen could make use of such a gift  --  a clairvoyant in the family . STEPHEN You must n't take it too seriously , Irene . It 's just the gypsy in her . LUCY Thank you , dear . IRENE Well , Gordon and I have got to be going . We 're driving over into Maryland-to the Hendricks ' . LUCY Oh ! SENATOR KEANE I-I did n't have a chance to tell you . ( To IRENE ) There 's plenty of time , is n't there ? IRENE I 'm afraid not . You Know , Senator Hendricks wants to talk to you before the others get there . ( She turns to the rest of the room ) It 'S rather important . LUCY Oh , then you 'd better start now , Gordon . Because sometime Irene 's car breaks down . p. 45 IRENE ( Ignoring this ) Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Yes , if you think we-Mrs . Wayne was going to show me some old photographs . IRENE Not really ? Dragging out the memoirs again , lucy ? " My Life and Times in the White House . " Oh , you can see those any time  --  ca n't he , lucy ? They 're always on exhibition . SENATOR KEANE Well  --  then if I may come again LUCY May he , Irene ? IRENE Of course ! I would n't dream of his missing those photographs ! With you in bloomers , playing basketball , or riding piggy-back on dear old Grandpa ! Well , good-bye , everbody ! We just must run ! Good-bye , Lucy ! You 're so fortunate to have a past , my dear . It gives you something to talk about . ( She sweeps out , taking KEANE with her . He mumbels a " Good-bye , Mrs. Wayne " as he disappears ) ( SOPHY follows them out ) ( There is a ghastly silence ) BELLE Count ten , Lucy . Count ten before you say a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here a little late , but as an old State Department man I gather that the situation is a bit strained . p. 46 TOM Tough luck , Lucy . I thought you had her going for a while there . STEPHEN Well , suppose we leave the girls to mop up . A battle-field 's no place for a diplomat . TOM I would have put two to one on you , Lucy . Something 's happened to your footwork . STEPHEN We 'll be upstairs , Lucy , if she comes back with reinforcements . ( The men go out ) MRS . IVES I never saw such a thing in all my life . The effrontery ! LUCY It was good , was n't it ? FORRESTER Well , I guess we ought to go back to work , should n't we ? MRS . IVES Oh , All Right . Though I should think those women would be waterlogged , from the tea they 've put away . FORRESTER Yes , how do they stand it ? An eternal diet of party food . MRS . IVES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife . Why , she can lick her weight in lettuce sandwiches . ( MRS . IVESandANN pass into the drawing room.OnlyLUCY and BELLE are left ) LUCY ( Who has been holding it in all this time ) Piggy-back ! Did you hear that ? What about her picture in one of those Baker stemers that buttoned up the back ! The never of her ! p. 47 BELLE Well , what did you expect ? LUCY But in my own house , Belle ! She came right in to my own house and took him ! As if he were flat silver ! BELLE You 're not surprised , are you ? The years you 've been in this town  --  you ought to be able to guess what 's back of it ? LUCY Back of it ? BELLE Do n't you know what year this it ? LUCY What do you mean ? BELLE This is a Presidential year . LUCY ( Stunned ) Presidential ? Keane ! But where does Irene come in ? What 's she got to do with it ? BELLE Everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Tell you I know what I 'm talking about . She 's steering him for the White House . LUCY Keane in the White House ? But I still do n't  --  what would Irene getout of it ? BELLE Only  --  First Lady . LUCY You 're out of your mind , Belle . BELLE Am I ? Think a minute . She 's through with carter Hibbard-you know that . This is her big chance . Keane is younger , and attractive , and it just may happen that he gets it . You know politics . p. 48 LUCY But Irene , Belle ! Irene in the White House ! It 's too funny . BELLE Nothing is too funny for this town . And Keane is just the kind they might fall for . Good-looking , Western , and does n't know a thing . Am I right or wrong ? ( SOPHY returns ) PRESCOTT Oh , this is where you are . Well , I ca n't say that I blame you . BELLE Pleasent dreams , Lucy . I 'll see what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she goes ) PRESCOTT Do n't you think you 'd better go in , lucy ? They 're breaking up . LUCY So am I. PRESCOTT What ? LUCY ( Half to herself ) I knew there was something behind it . I knew it . PRESCOTT What ? What are you talking about ? LUCY And it 's so simple when you really get hold of it . She 's going to divorce Carter , and marry Keane , and make him President . just like that . PRESCOTT I wish you 'd talk English , Lucy . LUCY Only I 'm not going to let her , Sophy . Keane in the White House when they could have a man like Stephen ! Why does n't she mind her own business , anyhow ? What if she is sick of Carter Hibbard and that Supreme Court black night gown of his ? When I think of Stephen  --  ( She stops suddenly as she slowly gets an idea ) Sophy ! p. 49 PRESCOTT What ? LUCY Sophy ! PRESCOTT What is it ? LUCY Sophy ! PRESCOTT If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she thought Carter had a chance to be President  --  a bigger chance than Keane , Sophy  --  what would she do ? She 'd stick to him , would n't she ? You bet she would ! PRESCOTT Now , Lucy ! LUCY So what we 've got to do , Sophy , is make Irene think that Carter 's going to be President ! We 're going to launch a Presidential boom . For Carter Hibbard ! Get it , Sophy ? PRESCOTT But they 'd never think of picking Carter ! LUCY Of course they would n't  --  that 's the whole point . But we 've got to make Irene think they would . PRESCOTT Lucy  --  LUCY Just a little bit of a boom , Sophy  --  just big enough to make Irene stay with Carter  --  happily with Carter . And incidentally sidetrack Gordon Keane . Piggy-back , eh ? Well , she 'll wish she was piggy-back before I get through with her ! p. 50 PRESCOTT Lucy , you 're out of your mind ! LUCY The only question is : How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you launch a Presidential boom , Sophy ? How do you launch a Presidential boom ? ( At which point the whole thing is happily solved by the entrance of  --  you 've guessed it  --  MRS . CREEVEY ) MRS . CREEVEY Oh , here you are , Mrs. Wayne ! LUCY ( As she puts two and two together ) Mrs. Creevey ! MRS . CREEVEY I 'm so sorry I have to rush . You see , ex-officio I am a member of every committee , and  --  LUCY My dear Mrs. Creevey , I 'm so sorry I did n't get a real chance to talk to you  --  why do n't you have lunch with me here to-morrow , just we two ? MRS . CREEVEY Why , Mrs. Wayne , I 'd be delighted . LUCY Oh , that 'll be fine ! Just the two of us and not any affiliated bodies ! Because I know just the man for you to get behind ! MRS . CREEVEY Really , Mrs. Wayne ? LUCY The very man ! You see , you 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sophy can get behind me  --  why , the possibilities are endless ! ( BUTLERS are opening the dining room door ; a babble of conversation is heard from the GUESTS grouped around the tea table ) @x CARTER HIBBARD 'S study . Walls lined with bookcases filled with books that are obviously " in re " or " vs. " something . Law reports , reference works , etc . Classical busts on top of bookcases , and , by way of contrast , a great mounted fish  --  a particularly homely fish , so realistically stuffed that you can almost hear it gasp . All of the furniture is heavy , ponderous . A Supreme Court chamber in miniature . In the biggest of the chairs sits CARTER HIBBARD , Associate Justice of the Supreme Court . In his sixties  --  dignified , solemn . A pile of law journals and Congressional Records at his elbow . He looks at his watch ; makes a little rumbling sound and pats his stomach ; picks up a newspaper and shakes it out , rather noisily . Adjusts his glasses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding him . Resplendent in evening clothes , obviously not donned just to sit home with CARTER HIBBARD . Jeweled sandals that reveal glistening burnt  --  orange toes .

I do n't see my soda tablets . BLEECKER Right there , sir . CARTER Oh , yes , yes . ( He puts a tablet on his tongue ; gulps it down with a swallow of water . His stomach rumbles again . Pulls out a cigar and noisily removes the cellophane wrapper . Pulls out an elaborate bunch of gadgets on a heavy chain and fumbles for a cigar clipper . Also on the chain is a nail clip ; this gives him an idea . He takes a good substantial hunk out of one of his nails ; then trims around the edges a little . Lights the cigar ; looks at his watch ; switches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The music of a dance orchestra comes over the air . He shakes out his paper again , and , with one final stomach rumble , settles to his reading ) ( IRENE , plainly , is in a mood . Each of these little separate acts of CARTER 'S has brought her nearer to the breaking point . The burnt -- orange toes tap the floor ; she gulps down her demi -- tasse at one swallow ) IRENE ( When Carter has finally settled himself ) I never saw a room with so many books in it and nothing to read ! " In re " and " versus " and the State of Michigan ! Or this ! ( She picks up a brilliantly colored detective story ) " Murder in a Phone Booth . " Oh , I know , I know . It relaxes you . p. 54 CARTER I 'm sorry , my dear . ( He starts to give her half the newspaper ) IRENE I do n't want the paper . ( HIBBARD sits down again . There is another pause as he absorbs himself in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pals are very amusing this evening .

( He laughs again ) I do n't see how these fellows think of something new every day . IRENE ( Whose eyes have been elsewhere ) Carter . CARTER Yes , my dear ? IRENE Would you mind terribly if I did something about that fish ? CARTER What ? IRENE If I could just get it to close its mouth . Maybe I could stand it then . CARTER My dear , that is one of the finest specimens of American Amberjack . I caught that off the Florida Coast  --  p. 55 IRENE ( Mechanically ) On February 26th , nineteen hundred and seventeen .

I wish you 'd always have it very hot . BLEECKER I 'm sorry , sir . CARTER ( His watch ) What time do you have , Bleecker ? BLEECKER Five minutes to eight , sir . CARTER Yes , that agrees with mine . ( He fools with the dial a little ; there is a burst of static ) p. 56 IRENE ( Yelling  --  to top the radio ) Bleecker , will you let me know as soon as the car is here ? BLEECKER Yes , madam .

Why should I stay in to see George Mason ? CARTER Well , he seemed to make a point of it . I ca n't imagine what his errand is  --  he was very mysterious about it . IRENE Probably wants to tell you about a fish he caught . I 'm sorry , Carter , but I 've made other plans . CARTER All right , my dear . ( IRENE pours another cup of coffee ) Two cups of coffee ? It 'll keep you awake . IRENE I hope to God it does . Until the car comes . ( The HIBBARD stomach gives another premonitory rumble ; he hastily takes another soda tablet ) p. 57 CARTER My stomach seems to be getting worse and worse . IRENE Well , you will race through your dinner , and make me race through mine . All to get to your radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do not expect me to miss the Whoops Family . IRENE Seven o'clock ! No civilized person dines at seven o'clock ! And it completely spoils the servants . CARTER It is not early dining that has given me my bad stomach . It 's the rich food prepared by that colored chef of yours . I 'll never be any better till you get rid of him . IRENE Carter , we 've been over this a thousand times . If I let him go he 'll go straight back to Lucy Wayne , and I 'm not going to let her have him . CARTER That 's the real trouble with my stomach . Fried chicken , not the Whoops Family . I should n't eat anything fried ! ( He consults his watch again ; fools with the dial ) IRENE Carter . CARTER H 'm ? IRENE I 'm going to Middleburg over the week-end . The Anthonys . CARTER What ? p. 58 IRENE I 'm going to spend the week-end with the Anthonys . In Middleburg . CARTER ( He looks up ) This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRENE Well , what of it ? CARTER What of it ? We must go there together . There are two places that we must always go together  --  the Chief Justice 's and the White House . IRENE The Chief Justice 's dinners bore me to death . Habeas corpus , and you 're home again at ten-thirty . And the Anthonys are having a very amusing crowd . CARTER That 's beside the point . The Chief Justice is the Chief Justice . ( Suddenly he is reminded of an amusing incident in the day 's work ) He was very perturbed to-day . You should have been there . Henshaw contended that a judgment resting on service by publication was not valid as a judgment in per-sonam . I brought the briefs home with me . A most interesting case . Now , where are those papers ? ( He is looking around ) IRENE ( Quite calmly ) I ate them . CARTER How 's that ? IRENE I ate them . p. 59 CARTER My dear , you 're behaving very peculiarly to-night . ( THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CARTER Ah , here we are ! THE RADIO The correct time is fifteen seconds after eight o'clock . CARTER ( Looking at his watch ) I have just ten . THE RADIO The J. K. Starrett Corporation presents The Whoops Family . IRENE ( As the Whoops Family theme song is softly played over the radio ) Carter , will you turn that off , please ? CARTER Turn it off ? Irene , you know very well that after the grind of the day 's work the clean wholesome fun of the Whoops Family  --  IRENE Relaxes you ! I know ! And when you 're relaxed you stay relaxed until Bleecker brings your ovaltine , and that relaxes you again ! And then you go to bed , and GOD ! how you relax ! CARTER That is an unreasonable contention , my dear . The greatest minds in history required relaxation . Take Abraham Lincoln . He too relished an occasional bit of humor . IRENE Yes , Carter . But you have all of Lincoln 's annoying qualities and none of his great ones . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE RADIO Good evening , folks ! What is it that gives that lovely , sweet taste to the mouth when little tousle-heads make ready for another day ? It is Dr. Mackintosh 's Sweetie-Wheaties , especially prepared for the  --  ( IRENE , in fury , strides to the radio and snaps it off ) CARTER ( On his feet ) Irene ! IRENE I 'm through , Carter . CARTER What 's that ? IRENE I 'm through . Through , done , finished ! CARTER My dear , this is a most unseemly exhibition . IRENE Oh , come down off that bench ! Stop being a Supreme Court judge and be a human being just long enough to understand this . I 'm leaving you , Carter . I 'm leaving you because I ca n't stand it  --  one  --  minute  --  longer . CARTER You do n't know what you 're saying ! Because I turned on the radio ? IRENE ( In an unnatural voice ) Yes ! Because you turned on the radio . That 's as good a reason as any . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason . That would n't stand in a court of law . IRENE Law , law ! What 's law got to do with marriage ? What 's law compared to the Whoops Family , and those briefs you bring home , and that fish up on the wall , and that kit of tools that you carry in your pocket , and your stomach , stomach , stomach ! What 's law got to do with your stomach ? Answer me that ! CARTER So ! This is a case of incompatibility ! IRENE And sitting here night after night ! Night after night after night after night after night ! Relaxing ! CARTER ( Finally stung ) You have n't sat here very many nights . Traipsing around with young Keane all over the place ! How about that ? Is it my stomach or Senator Keane that 's at the root of this ? I suppose he has n't got a stomach ! IRENE I never should have married a man so much older . CARTER You 're not so young any more . You have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ! IRENE Leave my age out of this ! CARTER You tried marrying a younger man . That did n't work so well either . p. 62 IRENE Leave my marriage out of it , too ! CARTER You bought your rotten little Prince Gregoravitch and then you had to buy the filthy Slovanian courts to get rid of him  --  when I think of myself mixing in that mess ! You were just as eager then for respectability as you are now to escape from it ! Well , I 've given it to you ! The daughter of Sockless Sam Baker is the wife of a Supreme Court Justice ! IRENE You leave my father out of this ! CARTER Sockless Sam Baker ! Never took a spoon out of a coffee cup ! And I 've given you a social position second to none ! IRENE Thank you so much . And I suppose I did n't buy you , too ! All those years you were counsel for Baker Steamers . Doing their dirty work ! CARTER Irene , you know my stomach . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my constitution . IRENE Constitution ! If it is n't your constitution it 's the country 's  --  I do n't know which is the more deadly ! All I know is that I 'm sick of them both ! I 'm sick of you , if you must know ! And you do n't want me ! You 've got your Supreme Court and your fish  --  that 's all you care about ! Just be careful that you do n't get them mixed up ! p. 63 CARTER That will do , Irene . You have chosen to cast aspersion upon my calling  --  the highest and noblest in all the world . It is an offense I can neither forgive nor condone . IRENE That suits me , as long as you understand the situation . I want a divorce and I want it quickly . You got me one when you were a dinky Cleveland lawyer ; it ought to be easy for a Supreme Court judge . CARTER You 'll get your divorce  --  go ! Go ! And take that fancy chef with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public opinion , the onus will be borne by you . IRENE Onus ! Onus ! Do you think anyone cares what the wife of a Supreme Court judge does ? Do you think anyone even knows that a Supreme Court judge has a wife ? Do you suppose a Supreme Court Justice is credited with any passion stronger than heartburn ! CARTER ( With enormous dignity ) The discussion is at an end . ( BLEECKER enters ) BLEECKER Judge Mason is here , sir . CARTER What ? Oh , yes , yes , yes . Bring him in . IRENE ( Hastily collecting her accessories ) I 'm getting out of here ! ( Before she can escape , however , MASON 'S voice is heard in the hallway . She is trapped ) p. 64 MASON Thank you , Bleecker . Here you are , Mrs. Creevey . ( MRS . CREEVEY  --  LOUELLA MAY CREEVEY  --  looms up in the doorway , and with her JUDGE MASON . A pleasant-looking man , somewhere in his fifties . Behind the two of them , not visible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is only by reason of his being a stranger in the house that he is not in charge of the little flock . His name is GANNING  --  ELLSWORTH T. GANNING ) Good evening , Carter ! Well , Irene ! Ms. Justice , I 've taken the liberty of bringing along some mighty fine folks  --  two people that are among your greatest admirers . Irene , I want to introduce you to Mrs. Creevey  --  MRS . CREEVEY Mrs. Louella May Creevey , president of the Women 's Peace , Purity and Patriotism League . It is indeed a pleasure , Mrs. Hibbard . MASON And Ms. Justice Hibbard . MRS . CREEVEY Mr. Justice ! What an honor ! CARTER Very kind of you , I 'm sure . MASON And this man you do n't have to be introduced to . Ells-worth T. Ganning , of the Ganning newspapers . CARTER How do you do , sir ? GANNING Mrs. Hibbard.Mr . Justice , this is an occasion that has been too long deferred . Our mutual friend Harper Knowles was to have brought us together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to address the National Publishers ' Association . p. 65 CARTER Oh , yes , yes , I remember . Please  --  sit right down . ( Bringing a chair into place ) Mrs.  --  ah  --  Creely  --  MRS . CREEVEY Creevey . Louella May Creevey . Justice Hibbard , before we go any further , I must tell you how much we admire your record on the bench . Ever since your vote in the Rosika Schwimmer case you have consistently upheld our contention that women are not women  --  they are persons ! Because we do not want to be discriminated for any more than against  --  we will not tolerate laws that discriminate between the sexes as sexes . In a larger sense , there is no sex . Is there , Mrs. Hibbard ? IRENE ( Stumped ) Well  --  in a larger sense . MRS . CREEVEY I knew you would agree with me . ( She starts to sit ) I hope I 'm not taking your chair ? IRENE No , no . That 's quite all right . MRS . CREEVEY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So warm , so human ! And books , books ! Books make a room so livable . I 'm sure you and the Justice must spend many happy hours here , Mrs. Hibbard . IRENE Oh , many . p. 66 MASON I always liked this room . Sort of reminds me of old times . That desk of yours , Carter  --  same one he had in Cleveland , on the Appellate bench . MRS . CREEVEY How human ! How delightfully human ! MASON Yes , sir , he has n't changed a bit . Even when I 'm up there in the Capitol , arguing a case before him , he 's still just a hometown boy to me . MRS . CREEVEY Ah , what a wonderful thing it is  --  to preserve one 's simplicity ! GANNING That 's very true . When I was a poor country boy , breaking the ice in the water pitcher before I could wash , I resolved that I would never lose the common touch , no matter how successful I became . And although to-day the Ganning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million copies , I hope I can truthfully say that I am still that country boy at heart . ( There is an appreciative gurgle from Mrs. CREEVEY ) IRENE ( Seizing the first opportunity ) Well , if you 'll excuse me , I have an engagement . I 'm sure I 'd only be in your way . MRS . CREEVEY Oh , no , Mrs. Hibbard ! Just the contrary ! MASON We need you too , Irene . p. 67 GANNING You are a vital part of this , Mrs. Hibbard , I assure you . IRENE ( Puzzled ) Really ? MASON Yes , indeed Well , people , what do you say ? Shall we get under way ? GANNING All right . MRS . CREEVEY I 'm ready ! MASON ( Trying to put the whole thing on an informal basis ) Carter , we feel that these are pretty ticklish times . When Mrs. Creevey came to me  --  as a boyhood friend of yours  --  with the suggestion that I am about to present to you , my first reaction was : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago ? Then I said to myself , now , who is the man who can get behind this thing and put it over ? Well , sir , there was only one answer  --  Ellsworth T. Ganning , of the Ganning newspapers . Carter , we feel that what the country needs  --  and when I say " we " I am speaking for the Bar Association  --  we feel that with all the changes made in the Constitution latterly , it would n't be a bad idea to have a President who understood administering it , let alone had read it . And I speak for the State Association , too . CARTER Presidency ? You mean  --  of the Bar Association ? p. 68 MRS . CREEVEY Ah , what modesty ! MASON No , Carter . I mean the Presidency of the United States . CARTER Why  --  why  --  MASON Now do n't say a word yet . Not a word . We want you to think seriously before answering . MRS . CREEVEY And you too , Mrs. Hibbard . I know what your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain , the burden of it all . Can he bear it ? MASON Say ! Anybody that can wade all day in a trout stream  --  eh , Carter ? CARTER ( Still in a daze ) What 's that ? Oh , yes , yes . Well , may I say that this is  --  pretty overwhelming ? MASON I do n't blame you . It overwhelmed me at first . CARTER But  --  does this mean I would have to resign from the Supreme bench ? MASON Oh , not for a long while . Nobody 's to know about this for weeks  --  we 're not breathing a word . MRS . CREEVEY Not even a syllable ! Millions of women are keeping perfectly quiet . MASON All we want now is permission to sound people out  --  very quietly . p. 69 GANNING Then , when the time comes , we shoot ! Announcement , publicity  --  why , I 'll put your picture on the front page of twenty million newspapers every day , right opposite my signed editorial . You ca n't lose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MASON It 's up to you , Carter . MRS . CREEVEY The women of America are hanging on your words . CARTER Gentlemen  --  and Mrs. Creevey  --  I am of course engrossed in the honorable position I occupy . I regard with repugnance the strifes and partisanships of political life . Also , in the last analysis , there is a personal element involved . Any decision of this magnitude must rest with  --  my dear wife . MRS . CREEVEY How sweet ! How too , too sweet ! GANNING ( With a flourish ) Well , Mrs. Hibbard ? MASON First Lady of the Land , Irene ! MRS . CREEVEY America waits ! IRENE What can I say ? My husband 's interests are mine ; his life is mine . I can but follow him , even though it means giving up the peace and quiet of our own fireside . ( And , with that sweet dignity which is so much a part of IRENE , she embraces him ) p. 70 MRS . CREEVEY Oh ! Beautiful ! GANNING Great ! Then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to put you over , too ! GANNING You know the first picture I 'm going to print ? You and Mrs. Hibbard sitting in this room , just the way I found you here to-night . Just the way millions of American couples sit home every night , talking over the day 's work , listening to the radio . IRENE Oh , yes , he does both . Do n't you , Carter ? We hurry through dinner every night , so that he can hear the Whoops Family . MRS . CREEVEY How human ! IRENE And of course he reads detective stories . ( She picks up " Murder in the Phone Booth " ) They relax him . GANNING Like Woodrow Wilson ! MRS . CREEVEY Ah , it 's so wonderful to relax ! I often say to Ms. Creevey  --  he is one of the largest manufacturers of bed-ticking in the country , and is more tense than most people realize  --  I often say to him : if you only would relax , Irving  --  IRENE Oh , Carter 's wonderful that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 71 GANNING And Mason tells me you 're a fisherman , too . That 's all good rotogravure , you know . Hip boots , basket , that sort of thing . IRENE Oh , yes , indeed . Like Calvin Coolidge . MRS . CREEVEY ( Worshipfully ) Calvin Coolidge ! IRENE ( Indicating the atrocity on the wall ) That 's an American Amberjack . Caught off the Coast of Florida , February twenty-sixth , nineteen hundred and seventeen . MRS . CREEVEY Think of it ! She knows the very date ! GANNING A real American wife , that 's what she is ! You know what I want from you , Mrs. Hibbard ? A daily feature article on home-making . How to put up quince preserves , make your own dresses , apple pie , all the good old American dishes ! IRENE I 'd be delighted . MRS . CREEVEY She 'll be another Dolly Madison ! GANNING Wonderful , wonderful ! IRENE But of course I only know the simplest dishes . Because Carter has such a delicate stomach . Have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's marvelous ! That 'll appeal to people all over the country ! Do you know how many people in this country have got bad stomachs ? Millions ! Millions ! p. 72 MRS . CREEVEY ( Beaming ) Mr. Creevey has one ! IRENE ( Gathering up the bottle on the desk ) Darling , you must n't forget your tablets ! You know , if I do n't look after him he just does n't do a thing for himself ! ( She shakes a handful of the tablets out of the bottle ) Just a great big baby , really ! ( It is the real American wife at her best , her most uxorial . Mrs. CREEVEY and the others look on in worshipful admiration as  --  THE CURTAIN FALLS p. 73 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE II The Wayne living room . Rather late in the evening  --  the room empty and dimly lit . After a moment the dining room doors are opened by STEPHEN WAYNE  --  there is a burst of masculine laughter as he does so . One gets a glimpse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white shirt fronts , heavy cigar smoke , crumpled napkins , demi-tasses . STEPHEN ( As he emerges ) I tell you they 've got a horse named after you ! And I 'll prove it to you ! ( He comes into the room and gathers up the evening paper . Meanwhile the crowd in the dining room is in a heavily jocular mood  --  there is another burst of laughter , followed by a voice that rises above the noise : " Which end of the horse was it , Stephen ? " Another laugh ) STEPHEN ( Returning with the paper ) Here you are ! He ran down in Florida to-day . His name is Tightwad ! ( A much bigger laugh this time , as STEPHEN closes the doors ) ( A clock strikes on the mantel . Eleven ) ( LUCY and GORDON KEANE enter from the hall . LUCY is in evening clothes and wrap ; KEANE in tails and high hat ) p. 74 LUCY Oh , of course you can . They 're still in there talking  --  they 'll be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do press that button , will you ? Right at the side of the door . That 's right . Well , I must say that you set up a very nice evening , Senator . Flowers , dinner , theatre  --  what more could a girl ask ? SENATOR KEANE I 'm sorry the play was n't better . I thought it would be something worth seeing . A year in New York . LUCY Yes , but that does n't mean much any more  --  a year in New York . With traffic the way it is over there , it takes six months just to get to the theatre . ( The ubiquitous CHARLES has made an entrance by this time ) Will you have something to drink , Senator ? SENATOR KEANE No , thank you . LUCY What are they doing in there , Charles ? Just dawdling over the coffee and burning holes in the table cloth ? CHARLES Yes , ma'am . But I gave them one of the old ones , so there 's no harm done . ( He withdraws ) LUCY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with wadded up napkins and melted ice cream ? ( She is at her desk by this time , glancing through the late mail ) Bills bills bills . Hotel Shoreham . Cocktail hour , four-thirty to seven . You know , it 's calling that an hour that 's put this country where it is to-day . p. 75 SENATOR KEANE ( After a polite laugh ) Now , look  --  I 'd like to tell you about my agricultural bill , if you do n't mind . LUCY Oh , I 'd be delighted . But just very simply . Words of one syllable . SENATOR KEANE All right . ( He looks around the room ) Now , take that telephone receiver . LUCY Oh , that 's fine . I can understand that . A telephone receiver . SENATOR KEANE Well , in our State Experimental Laboratories they 've worked out a way to make that same thing out of ordinary cornstalks . LUCY Cornstalks ? You do n't tell me ? SENATOR KEANE You see what it means , do n't you ? To the farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any place in the cornfield .

Both are in evening clothes ) LUCY Oh , here 's Emmy ! PAIGE Oh , Aunt Lucy , we had the most marvelous time ! Senator , mighty nice to see you . p. 76 SENATOR KEANE Good evening , Miss Paige . PAIGE I declare I never did see anything so beautiful as that Italian Embassy , and the Ambassador was the cutest thing . I like to died he was so cute . LUCY Gordon , this is Jason Fleming . Senator Keane , Jason . ( The men exchange greetings ) PAIGE Everybody there was a signora or an excellency or something  --  I just could n't take my eyes off that Countess Di What's-Her-Name  --  you know , that stunning one that sort of unwinds when she gets up . LUCY Well , it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who took you in ? PAIGE ( In fresh raptures ) The most beautiful attach in the Embassy  --  or in the whole world , I reckon . Where 's the card , Jason ? The one the gentlemen get downstairs to find the ladies by ? FLEMING ( Producing her evening bag ) I told her to relax , Mrs. Wayne  --  that Mussolini makes them resign from the Diplomatic Service if they marry out of their country . SENATOR KEANE That 's one law of his I approve of . PAIGE You  --  all are just mean . ( She finds the card ) Here it is  --  I made him give it to me for my scrapbook . Conte Guilio  --  ( She pronounces it " Julio " ) p. 77 LUCY Jee-lio , Emmy . PAIGE Yes , that 's what he said . Conte Jeelie Giordano . Is n't that divine ? I got his autograph , too . LUCY That ought to be worth something . PAIGE And here 's a picture of the whole table . Entre  --  that 's where you go in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French ? I was just dying to ask Jee-ulio all about everything but all through supper they kept playing music  --  you could n't talk at all . LUCY That 's why they have the music , Emmy . That 's called diplomacy . FLEMING I hope you never write a book about us , Mrs. Wayne . You know too many of the tricks . LUCY You 're the one to do that , Jason . ( To KEANE ) You know , if it were n't for this man we 'd be at war all the time . How 's the latest imbroglio , Jason ? FLEMING Well , we 're still working on it . LUCY ( To KEANE again ) Somebody slipped up on the entrance cards for the White House diplomatic reception , and one of them  --  which country was it , Jason ?  --  got delivered at the wrong door with the ice cream or something . p. 78 FLEMING Oh , that was Germany . And the worst of it was it was French ice cream . LUCY You see the complications.Tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trans-Bulgania still speaking to us ? FLEMING Well , it looks as though they 're coming around . LUCY You know , Jason knows more about the Balkans than they do themselves . All these little new countries that spring up after every rain  --  he knows them all . SENATOR KEANE ( After an appropriate laugh ) Well , I think I 'd better be going . It must be getting pretty late . FLEMING Me too . I 've got to be diplomatic at nine a. m. sharp . SENATOR KEANE ( To LUCY ) Now , look . There 's going to be a hearing on the bill at nine o'clock to-morrow morning . You 'll be there , wo n't you ? LUCY Nine ? You know , I 've got a wonderful idea . Suppose I send Emmy in my place ? She 's never seen a hearing . PAIGE What ? LUCY Would n't you like that , Emmy ? Up at the Capitol ? Because I just remembered I have another engagement . p. 79 PAIGE Oh , I 'd love to !

LUCY Well , this is a democracy . PAIGE Oh , I just thought of something ! Why do n't I begin collecting Senators ? LUCY What ? PAIGE Autographs , I mean . LUCY Oh ! You scared the life out of me , Emmy . SENATOR KEANE I do n't think you 'd have a bit of trouble , Miss Paige . Well  --  good night . PAIGE I 'll take you out to the door . SENATOR KEANE Oh , thanks . PAIGE What time do you want me to be there ? SENATOR KEANE Well , the hearing starts at nine o'clock . PAIGE I 'll get there at half past eight .

At this ghastly hour ! Did n't you go home ? PRESCOTT Well , it seemed a heaven-sent opportunity to do the invitations for your Diplomatic Corps dinner . It 's the trickiest job  --  I only trust myself with it . LUCY You must be dead . Do n't you want a drink or something ? PRESCOTT No , thanks . Did you have a pleasant evening ? How was the play ? LUCY Oh , fair . ( As CHARLES enters ) Charles , do something about getting the men out of there , will you ? Nothing drastic , you understand  --  just something subtle , like pulling Ms. Hardwick 's chair from under him , or yelling " Fire ! " or something . You did n't forget to serve his coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With cream . CHARLES No , ma'am . I remembered . LUCY I wonder what they 're doing in there all this time ? Have n't they come out at all ? p. 81 PRESCOTT No . I kept hearing shouts and murmurs for a while , but they 've been suspiciously quiet now for a long time . LUCY I hope I 'm not missing anything good . PRESCOTT Well , tell me all about it . How are you and the Boy Senator getting along ? LUCY ( Taking a long breath ) Oh , very well . Too well . Sophy , he has a plan  --  you must get him to tell you about it  --  he 's going to make typewriter ribbons out of skim milk or something , and save the American farmer . Of course I 've been making silk purses out of sows ' ears all my life , but I did n't tell him that . PRESCOTT You seem to be picking up where Irene left off . LUCY ( Brightening immediately ) Sophy , she was at the theatre . Sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so beautifully connubial . She actually believes it , Sophy . It was a great success , Sophy , the whole idea . And it was worth doing , in spite of Gordon . PRESCOTT Speaking of Gordon , what are you going to do with him now that you 've got him ? Salvation Army ? LUCY Well , I had a little inspiration there . At least , I think I did . Emmy . She 'll just love these typewriter ribbons . p. 82 PRESCOTT Why do n't you open a day nursery ? ( TOM HARDWICK comes through the dining room doors . We hear his voice as the door opens : " Well , you fellows do n't know anything .  --  I 'm going to talk to a real politician .

That 's the way vegetable soup ought to be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to skate on soup stock . LUCY Tell me  --  it 's been a pretty long huddle in there . What 's it all about ? TOM I wish to God I knew  --  I never heard so much tripe in my life . Who does this Ganning think he is , anyhow ? LUCY Ssh ! Do n't ask him  --  he 'll tell you . TOM All right , he 's in the newspaper business , but when they 've got a good business of their own why do they think they have to mix into politics ? What 's politics got to do with business ? What 's back of it , anyhow ? Has he got a wife that wants to be an Ambassador or something ? LUCY Well , it 's nice work if you can get it . TOM Now , Sedgwick  --  he 's different . I do n't mind bankers . As long as they keep their mouth shut and pay the bills . But Ganning ! Why , he 's Public Opinion himself . p. 83 LUCY What 's been getting you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done anything , have they ? TOM Done anything ? Do you know what they want to do ? LUCY What ?

GANNING Mrs. Wayne , Mrs. Ganning told me I must n't come home without your promise to dine with us next time you 're in New York . Now what are you going to do about it ? LUCY Well , I would n't stand in the way of your going home for anything . GANNING That 's fine  --  Mrs. Ganning 'll be delighted . ( He finds himself next to TOM HARDWICK ) Got a match , Hardwick ? TOM ( Who would n't give him one if he had ) No ! ( The last two diners , STEPHEN WAYNE and HERBERT SEDGWICK , have emerged from the dining room . EMMY , too , has come back by this time ) STEPHEN Well , we 're finally out of the dining room , anyhow . Had you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , darling . Ms. Sedgwick , how are you ? SEDWICK A little groggy , after that session . I guess I 'm spoiled by directors ' meetings . STEPHEN Yes , you business men just get together , vote yourselves a bonus , and in five minutes it 's all over . But half the fun of politics is talking about it . LUCY And the other half ? STEPHEN Well , darling , now you 've got me . SEDWICK Ganning , ought n't we to be on our way ? ( He turns to LUCY ) We 've got to catch a train to New York . GANNING Okay ! Well  --  seems to me we 're all set . Ms. Secretary , you represent the President more or less . You say he wo n't put up any hurdles ? STEPHEN Well , of course that has to be handled delicately .

TOM ( Bitterly ) It seems we need a man who can interpret the laws of the country , and we got so God-damned many now that it takes a Supreme Court Justice to do it . LUCY ( Recovering herself ) But  --  Carter Hibbard ! How  --  how did you ever come to select him ? PAIGE ( Unable to contain herself ) Is he going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep still , Emmy . TOM Well , if you ask me I do n't see yet how it happened . GANNING He 's the logical candidate , that 's all . p. 86 TOM Well , maybe . I 'm not crazy about him , but there 's no denying he 's got the jump on us . STEPHEN There just seems to be a lot of Hibbard sentiment , Lucy . We do n't know how it started  --  GANNING Spontaneously , I assure you . STEPHEN Anyhow , it certainly exists , and it 's sort of taken us by surprise . The women 's clubs are back of him solid , and the bar associations . Taking the whole thing together , it looks as though he 's got a head start . GANNING Well , I do n't see where you 'd get a better man . A poor boy , born in Kentucky  --  there 's a doubtful State to begin with , Kentucky . Studied law in Ohio  --  there 's the Lincoln touch . Fishes every year in Wisconsin and Florida  --  there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia  --  another doubtful State . I tell you , he 's a natural . TOM Well , I hope to God you 're right . LUCY But  --  he is n't known to the country . It takes years to build up a Presidential candidate . SEDWICK Not to-day it does n't . Thanks to the radio . GANNING ( Bridling ) And the Ganning newspapers . p. 87 SEDWICK Yes , of course . LUCY But  --  have you been to him ? Has he accepted already ? GANNING Oh , I think we can wangle that . TOM ( Morbidly ) I 'm afraid so . GANNING As a matter of fact , he 's written a most human document on that very point . If you gentlemen will bear with me , I 'd like to read it to Mrs. Wayne . LUCY I 'd be delighted . GANNING At the proper moment I shall publish this in the Ganning papers . LUCY I 'm sure . GANNING ( Reads ) " My dear Ellsworth : Replying to your courteous note , I can only say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have come to me , and therefore I can not longer postpone expressing my feelings on the subject . I am not a candidate for the nomination . " PAIGE He is n't going to take it ? LUCY Emmy ! GANNING " My present duty and responsibilities should satisfy any man who desires to render public service . They satisfy me , and I have no inclination to relinquish them . But  --  " p. 88 LUCY I see . PAIGE Maybe he 's going to change his mind . GANNING " But my wishes may not coincide with my duty . If it be true , as many responsible people assure me , that a decided majority of the better element  --  " TOM Better element ! GANNING " Are insistent that I accept the nomination for this great office , I shall deem it my duty , as well as an honor and a privilege , to do so . With every assurance of my best wishes , my dear Ellsworth , I am yours most sincerely , " CARTER HIBBARD . " LUCY Well , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hearing that letter for the second time , it sort of grows on you , does n't it ? GANNING Yes , it does . SEDWICK Mm . Personally , I feel that he can be persuaded . Ganning , we 'd better get to the train . Sorry to run , Mrs. Wayne , but you understand . GANNING Mrs. Wayne , my thanks for a delightful evening . And a most fruitful one . I feel that history has been made in this house to-night . LUCY Has n't it , though ? p. 89 SEDWICK ( Making his adieus to his host ) Mr. Secretary . STEPHEN ( Moving with them to the door ) Sorry you have to go . ( He turns to HARDWICK ) Tom , you 're not catching any trains . Why do n't you wait a minute ? TOM Okay ! ( With a few more good-byes STEPHEN takes SEDGWICK and GANNING out ) PAIGE Is n't it exciting ? Is this the way they make Presidents  --  just sort of at home like this ? LUCY It 's fantastic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looks as though we 're in for it . Funny thing about it is , Lucy , I would n't be surprised if we won with him . Supreme Court , and he sort of looks like a President . They do n't know he 's full of sawdust . LUCY No . I suppose not . PAIGE ( A sudden idea ) I just thought of something . Does this mean Mrs. Hibbard is going to be the First Lady ? And be in the White House and everything ? LUCY ( After a pause ) Emmy , why do n't you run up to bed ? p. 90 PAIGE ( Reluctant ) Well  --  all right . You 're sure nothing else is going to happen ? LUCY No . Everything has happened , Emmy . PAIGE Well  --  good night , then . ( She goes ) ( SOPHY , too , makes a tactful withdrawal at this juncture ) TOM Sorry , Lucy . I never thought of that Irene angle . Well , you girls 'll just have to kiss and make up , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LUCY I hate to face myself . TOM You know , Lucy , I was n't going to say anything till it came off , but  --  we sort of had our hearts set on swinging this for Stephen . LUCY Oh , do n't , Tom . TOM Had n't been for this Hibbard business we could have done it , too . Even had the President with us . Then Ganning crashed through with all these clubwomen behind him  --  God , I wish women would keep out of politics . LUCY ( Ever so quietly ) So do I. TOM Well  --  too bad . Would have been kind of right  --  Stephen in the White House . And you there again , Lucy  --  it would have been kind of right . ( He looks at the portrait ) Andy would have liked it , too . ( STEPHEN saunters back from the hallway ) p. 91 STEPHEN Want to thresh a while , Tom ? TOM ( As he starts out ) What the hell is there to thresh about ? We 're in for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you , Lucy ? Want to come along ? LUCY ( In a low voice ) No , thank you , Stephen . ( HARDWICK is on his way by this time . STEPHEN looks at Lucy a moment ; is impelled to go to her , but does n't . After all , Lucy WAYNE is not a weakling ) ( As he reaches the door , however , Lucy calls him back ) LUCY Stephen STEPHEN Yes , dear . ( Something in her face tells the story  --  he comes back to her . She hesitates for a moment . It is hard to know how to begin ) LUCY Stephen , you know I love you , do n't you ? STEPHEN Well , I hope so . LUCY No , I mean it . I do love you , Stephen . I do love you . STEPHEN ( Surprised at the depth of her tone ) Why , Lucy ! p. 92 LUCY I just wanted to say it , that 's all . I love you . STEPHEN Now Lucy , it 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't say I would n't have liked it  --  at least I 'd be sure then that the work of these last years would n't be tipped over . But  --  you 've just got to put it out of your mind . It 's all right . LUCY I wish I could take it like you , Stephen . But I ca n't  --  I ca n't ! It kills me . STEPHEN We 've got to be sports about it  --  that 's all there is to it . Funny it has to be Irene , is n't it ? LUCY Yes , is n't it ? STEPHEN I 'm sorry , my dear . I 'm sorry to have failed you . LUCY ( Holding back the tears ) Stephen , my darling ! Do n't ! Do n't ! STEPHEN Come now  --  this is n't like you . LUCY Oh , Stephen ! Stephen ! Stephen ! STEPHEN ( Comforting her ) I know . I know . LUCY ( Slowly coming out of it ) I 'm all right now . STEPHEN Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure you 're all right ? ( She smiles at him ) Coming up ? p. 93 LUCY In a minute . Finish up with Tom . ( He kisses her  --  tenderly , affectionately . A little smile passes between them when it 's all over . He goes ) ( For an appreciable interval LUCY stands there , motionless . She looks at the portrait . Then SOPHY enters  --  quietly , eager to pretend that nothing has happened . LUCY barely notices her as she moves about her work ) PRESCOTT ( Gathering up a few envelopes from the desk ; speaking entirely too casually ) These have to be delivered by hand in the morning . LUCY How could I , Sophy ? How could I have done it ? Poor Stephen ! That 's what I ca n't forgive myself  --  what I 've done to Stephen ! PRESCOTT Well , you might have known something like this would happen . You just got caught , that 's all . LUCY How was I to know ? Do you think for a minute I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who 'd ever believe they 'd do a thing like this ? Carter Hibbard ! Oh , if only I 'd never met that woman ! PRESCOTT What woman ? LUCY You know , with the affiliated bodies . ( With a gesture she generously outlines the CREEVEY figure ) If only I 'd never met her ! p. 94 PRESCOTT Anyhow , it 's done . But it ought to be a lesson to you . LUCY Yes . Yes . I 've got nothing to say for myself , Sophy . Nothing at all . But to think of me turning out to be one of those meddling Washington women  --  the kind I 've always despised , Sophy  --  and then I go and do the same thing myself ! To think of me being responsible for putting Carter Hibbard in the White House ! I wo n't have it , Sophy  --  that 's all . I wo n't have it ! PRESCOTT Well , it looks as though you 're going to have it ! LUCY Well , I wo n't ! And Irene , Sophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! I tell you I wo n't have her in those rooms ! PRESCOTT Now , Lucy  --  LUCY I wo n't , I wo n't ! I 'd use anything . ( She looks up at the portrait ) @x The scene is again the Secretary of State 's home  --  some time in the afternoon of an early Spring day . Sitting there as the curtain rises is EMMY-EMMY in trig riding clothes , and looking very attractive indeed . She is reading . CHARLES passes through the hall . PAIGE Oh , Charles ! CHARLES Yes , Miss ? PAIGE ( Indicating a sizable pile of magazines at her elbow ) Is this all there are of the Congressional Records ? CHARLES There may be some more in Mrs. Wayne 's room . Shall I get them ? PAIGE Well  --  not now . These 'll last me a little while . ( She settles herself , with a good deal of squirming , and takes another Record as CHARLES goes out . She opens it with high hopes , but the first page turns out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further , but there are still no pictures . She puts it down and tries another ) ( SOPHY comes in  --  from the outer hallway , and with hat and coat on . She carries a few small packages , and is her usual business-like self ) PRESCOTT Oh , hello there ! Been riding ? p. 96 PAIGE No , not yet . I 'm just waiting to go . PRESCOTT ( Mildly surprised ) What are you reading ? The Congressional Record ? PAIGE Uh-huh . PRESCOTT And all those too ? PAIGE Well , I have n't read'em yet , but I 'm going to . PRESCOTT You 've got a busy summer . ( CHARLES has meanwhile entered . He takes SOPHY 'S coat ) Any messages , Charles ? Did the cards come from the printer ? CHARLES Yes , Miss . They 're right on the desk . PRESCOTT Oh , fine . Let 's see  --  the flowers wo n't be here till six . What did they say about the terrapin ? Was it all right ? CHARLES Yes , Miss Prescott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think we 'll use the lace cloth and the silver epergnes . CHARLES Yes , Miss . ( He goes ) PRESCOTT Well , I might as well get at it . ( She takes up the packet of cards ) p. 97 PAIGE Oh , those are cute . Is that to-night 's dinner ? PRESCOTT Now , do n't touch anything , Emmy . ( She picks up a handful of place-markers ) PAIGE Oh , what are you going to do with those ? PRESCOTT They mark where people sit , Emmy . The green ones are men and the white ones are women . ( She puts a couple of markers into their slots ) See ? PAIGE They look just like little tombstones . PRESCOTT You 're closer than you think . PAIGE Am I at the dinner ? PRESCOTT I do n't know yet . You may have to fill in . PAIGE Is Gordon going to be there ? PRESCOTT Yes , he is . PAIGE Oh ! ( She strolls back to her chair , thoughtfully ) PRESCOTT ( Busily writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAIGE What ? PRESCOTT You 're calling him Gordon now . p. 98 PAIGE My goodness , you ca n't keep calling him Senator . PRESCOTT No , I suppose not . ( There is a pause as she works away ) Oh , dear ! Where can you seat an ex-American Ambassador ? They do n't belong anywhere , and they 're so touchy . PAIGE ( Who has been absorbed in her Records again ) What did you say ? PRESCOTT Hostess troubles , Emmy . I was just talking to myself . ( They settle to their respective tasks ) PAIGE What 's the St. Lawrence water-wave ? PRESCOTT The what ? PAIGE The St. Lawrence water-wave ? PRESCOTT Not wave , Emmy . Waterway . PAIGE ( Looks again ) Oh , yes . I thought it sounded funny . ( Reading ) " I move to strike out in line 24 the word ' and ' and insert the word ' but . ' " My goodness , would n't you think they 'd have something better to do , with things the way they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAIGE And what 's it mean when they order a resolution to lie on the table ? They never did that while I was up there . p. 99 PRESCOTT That just means they want it out of the way , Emmy . PAIGE Well , would n't it be even more in the way on the table ? PRESCOTT They do n't mean a real table , Emmy . PAIGE Then why do they say table ? PRESCOTT It 's just an expression . PAIGE Well , here it says Senator Cartwright took the chair . Is it a real chair ? PRESCOTT Yes , it is a real chair . PAIGE Well , why do they have a real chair and not a real table ? PRESCOTT ( At her wit 's end ) Oh ! Why do n't you ask Senator Keane about it ? Let him explain it . PAIGE That 's just it . I do n't want him to know that I do n't know . PRESCOTT I 'm sure he 'll never guess . PAIGE I wish I knew as much as Aunt Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as well you do n't . PAIGE ( Going into a semi-trance ) Monday , Justices of the Supreme Court ; Tuesday , Congressmen ; Wednesday , the Cabinet ; Thursday , Senators ; and Friday , diplomatic . p. 100 PRESCOTT ( Who has only half heard all this ) What are you muttering about , anyhow ? PAIGE I was just seeing if I remembered the different At-Home days . Monday , Justices of the Supreme Court  --  ( The door bell rings ) Oh , I'reckon this is him . PRESCOTT Who 's coming ? Gordon ? PAIGE Mm . You 'd think that old Senate would be ashamed of itself , keeping ' em all in on a day like this . Here it is pretty near four o'clock . PRESCOTT Oh , it 's a dog 's life . Some days they can only play about eighteen holes . PAIGE Well , Gordon works awful hard . Last night at the movies he was writing a speech all during Jean Harlow . PRESCOTT Sounds like the perfect place to me . ( SENATOR KEANE enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to come right up . PAIGE ( Getting into her coat ) I 'm all ready . See how prompt I am ? SENATOR KEANE How do you do , Miss Prescott ? PRESCOTT Senator . p. 101 PAIGE I thought they were n't ever going to let you go . I was going to come right up there and get you . SENATOR KEANE I would n't have minded that . ( As EMMY adjusts her hat ) Miss Prescott , too bad you have to stay and work on a day like this . PRESCOTT Oh , this is n't work . I 'm just playing paper dolls . PAIGE Sophy 's fixing the places for to-night 's dinner . Oh , where 's Gordon going to sit ? Show Gordon where he 's going to sit . PRESCOTT Well , I 'm not sure yet . PAIGE Yes , you are ! ( She leans over and reads the cards ) You 've got Mrs. Archibald Wellington on one side  --  she 's the Vice-President 's daughter  --  and Madame von Langendonck  --  ( She has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . Who 's she ? PRESCOTT She 's the wife of the Dutch charg d'affaires . PAIGE Oh , yes , I know her . Oh , they 're both terribly brainy  --  they know all about everything . After you talk to them you wo n't ever want to see poor little me again . SENATOR KEANE Now , you know better than that . p. 102 PAIGE Oh , but I mean it . Because I 'm not bright the way they are  --  there 's nothing interesting about me . SENATOR KEANE Oh , but there is . You do n't know how interesting you are to me . PAIGE But they 're so much older than I am  --  they 've had so much experience . All I know is just to be myself . ( SOPHY , who has stood all she can , now brings a heavy paper-weight down on the desk with a bang ) ( BELLE HARDWICK appears in the doorway  --  there is a fleeting glimpse of CHARLES going on about his duties ) BELLE Hello , Sophy ! Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huh ? PRESCOTT No , not yet . PAIGE How do you do , Mrs. Hardwick ? BELLE Hello , Emmy . PAIGE You-all will excuse us , wo n't you ? We 're just going out riding . BELLE Run along . SENATOR KEANE Good-bye , Miss Prescott . Sorry I missed Mrs. Wayne . PAIGE Come on , Gordon . I hate to keep horses waiting . ( They go ) ( BELLE stands looking after them ) p. 103 BELLE What 's that all about ? PRESCOTT Love has come to the Senate . Tra-la . BELLE He certainly has got recuperative powers . Irene , Emmy  --  there 's a lot of bounce to the boy . PRESCOTT Is n't there , though ? BELLE Oh , ' well ! Lucy coming in soon ? PRESCOTT I 'm expecting her . She was at the Atwood luncheon . BELLE We have n't had a minute alone for ages . What 's she been doing , anyhow ? PRESCOTT Oh , nothing in particular . BELLE Do n't tell me nothing in particular . She 's up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To tell you the truth , Belle , I do n't know . She disappears for hours , and wo n't say a word when she comes back . BELLE But it 's Irene , is n't it ? PRESCOTT What ? BELLE It 's Irene she 's working on ? PRESCOTT I do n't know , Belle . I really do n't . BELLE Well , I certainly hope so . Do you realize what this town would be like with Irene in the White House ? p. 104 PRESCOTT It is n't a pleasant prospect . BELLE Pleasant ? It 's fantastic . Can you imagine her sweeping down those White House stairs at the State receptions , bowing graciously to the peasantry while the Marine Band blares out " Hail to the Chief ! " I hope they do n't forget some night and play " I Wonder Who 's Kissing Her Now . " Oh , well ! ( A glance at the dinner plan ) Is that to-night 's dinner ? PRESCOTT Uh-huh . BELLE Who do I get ? PRESCOTT Ah  --  let 's see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth T. Ganning himself . BELLE Ca n't stand him . PRESCOTT Well  --  ( Looking over her cards )  --  I can give you a Cuban attach , unless they have a revolution before dinner . BELLE Oh , I 'll take Ganning . I suppose , as the original Hibbard man , he 'll grab himself off a Cabinet place . Or will it be the Court of St. James 's ? PRESCOTT I think his wife prefers St. James 's . BELLE Yes , I suppose so . That 's all those New Yorkers see in politics . Those three feathers are more important to them than they are to a fan dancer . Oh , hello , Lucy . ( Lucy has entered . She is in a state of anxious excitement , obviously keyed up even beyond her usual pitch ) p. 105 LUCY Sophy , did anything come for me ? Oh , hello , Belle . The mail , I mean . Did anything come for me ? PRESCOTT What ? ( Reaching for a little pile of letters ) Why , no  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quickly running through them ) Oh , dear ! Is this everything ? PRESCOTT Well , there were a few invitations  --  LUCY No , no , I do n't mean that . BELLE Listen  --  read your mail later and talk to me for a minute . I 've got to get out of here . LUCY ( To SOPHY ) Well , did anybody call up ? Long distance , I mean . PRESCOTT Why , no , I do n't think so . Charles  --  ( He has been assisting LUCY with her coat )  --  were there any long distance calls for Mrs. Wayne ? CHARLES No , madam . ( A gesture of utter defeat from LUCY  --  she looks from one woman to the other ) BELLE For heaven 's sakes , Lucy , what on earth is the matter ? p. 106 LUCY ( A long breath ) They 're meeting here this afternoon . BELLE Who is ? LUCY All of them . Tom , and Ganning , and Carter . They 're making formal announcement in the morning . For President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You knew they were going to , sooner or later . LUCY But if I could have more time ! Once he 's out before the public it 's ten times as hard  --  you know that . Even a little thing might stop him now , if we had the right one . I 'm on the track of it , but if it does n't come to-day  --  BELLE What have you got ? What is it ? LUCY Oh , well , it 's not here , so what 's the use ? And just to make it perfect , who do you think is coming with him this afternoon ? With Carter , I mean . The little woman to whom he owes it all , who has stood so bravely at his side through all these years . BELLE Not really ? Irene ? LUCY Exactly . Irene . BELLE When did you know this ? LUCY Stephen called me at the luncheon . BELLE Did Tom know about it ? p. 107 LUCY What ? I suppose so . He 's coming here with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it and he did n't tell me . And I 've got to pour out at Esther Blodgett 's while all this is going on ! " How many lumps ? " ( She grimaces at an imaginary tea-drinker ) LUCY You should have been at my luncheon . They were all lumps . ( She picks up an invitation from the desk ) My God , the King of Egypt is having another birthday ! He must be five hundred ! ( Picking up a tray of cards ) And these asinine calling cards ! Obsolete anywhere else ! Washington theme song : " I hear you ca-alled on me-e-e ! " ( For emphasis she hurl the entire tray into the air . The cards flutter down like snow ) Oh , I 'm sorry . I 'll pick them up . PRESCOTT ( On her knees ) You 're in a May-time mood . BELLE I do n't blame her . It 's just the way I feel . LUCY Then why do n't you do something ? Why do you just stand here and  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , Charles ? CHARLES I just remembered , madam . Some bundles came for you this morning . p. 108 LUCY Bundles ? What sort of bundles ? CHARLES Quite large bundles , madam . ( He indicates the size ) They 're from out of town . Cleveland . LUCY ( At once galvanized ) Cleveland ? That 's what I am after ! Where are they ? Where 'd you put them ? CHARLES They 're in the cellar , madam . LUCY The cellar ? What did you expect them to do  --  sprout ? Get them , Charles ! For heaven 's sake , get them ! Go on ! Quick ! Hurry up ! ( She faces the others as a slightly bewildered CHARLES makes his exit ) Cleveland ! We 're saved ! PRESCOTT What is it ? BELLE What have you got ? LUCY At least I think we are ! It 's in re Carter Hibbard , if you know what I mean . You girls will have to excuse me if I get a little legal  --  there 's a reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy ! Will you tell us what this is all about ? LUCY All right ! Do you want to know what I 've been doing all these weeks ? Well , I 'll tell you . I 've been sitting in the Congressional Library , and I 've read every decision handed down by the Supreme Court since Carter Hibbard went on it . p. 109 BELLE Well , I do n't see  --  LUCY Oh , of course you do ! Because I felt pretty sure that somewhere along the line he 'd stubbed his toe . I wanted a case that had to do with women  --  where he affronted American Womanhood . So I just sat in that mausoleum , and I read , and I read , and I read  --  all about easement , and chattels , and depositions  --  do you know that a wife ca n't sue her husband for a personal tort , Sophy ? Well , she ca n't , no matter who the tort is  --  and I learned about competency , and estoppel , and fiduciaries , and nolle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know ! I could pass the bar examination in any State in the Union  --  but I found what I was after ! That 's the important thing ! BELLE What did you find ? PRESCOTT Yes  --  what ? LUCY The case of Mary Haggerty , God bless her . The case of Mary Haggerty versus  --  where 's my bag ? ( She reaches for the huge bag ; dumps out its contents in one great pile . Papers and general riff-raff are scattered over the table . A pair of dice roll out ) I 've got it written on a slip of paper . ( She dives into the pile ) Belle , help me . BELLE I never saw such a mess . ( Picking up a card ) " Sir Arthur Erskine . Minister Plenipotentiary . " ( She finds another ) " Nathan Feldstein . Send Me Your Old Rugs . " p. 110 LUCY Please , Belle ! BELLE You 've got everything here but golf sticks . What 's this ? LUCY Let me see . Oh , those are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to keep those . PRESCOTT Keep them ? You 've never thrown anything away . LUCY Well , you never can tell . BELLE Mrs. Mary Haggerty . Is this it ? LUCY ( Grabbing it ) That 's it ! ( She reads ) " Mrs. Mary Haggerty vs . Cleveland Interurban Railways , Inc . Ohio , 1912- ' 13 . A. L. R. , 2586 . " Whatever that means . ( She calls out ) Charles , where are those bundles ? CHARLES ( In the distance ) Right away , Mrs. Wayne . LUCY Oh , if I 'm only right about this ! Now , here 's the case . Mary Haggerty got on a Cleveland trolley car  --  this was way back in 1912 , when Carter was on the Appellate bench out there . Anyhow , Mary got on the car , and it seems she was in what 's called a delicate condition . Any-how , too delicate for a Cleveland trolley car . Well , they came to Euclid Avenue or some place , and along came a beer truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James J. Monahan stopped the trolley car abruptly to avoid hitting the truck , and what happened ? Mrs. Haggerty 's baby was born in the trolley car . Prematurely , and it died . Mrs. Haggerty sued the street car company , and the Appellate Court decided against her ! How 's that for justice ? Six to one , and you ca n't tell me Carter was the one ! He is n't built like that ! p. 111 BELLE Well , I do n't know , Lucy  --  LUCY Nonsense ! Of course it was appealed to the Supreme Court  --  that 's how I got hold of it . Only their records did n't name the judges  --  I mean out in Ohio . All it said was six to one . So I sent to Cleveland for the full report  --  used my pull with the Attorney General . Charles ! ( But CHARLES is already staggering in  --  tugging a great roped bundle in each hand ) Good heavens , they did n't send all that ! CHARLES There are two more outside , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them  --  Sophy , where are the scissors ? You open that one . BELLE Lucy , this was an awfully long time ago . Do you really think  --  LUCY You bet I do ! Oh , it may have been according to law , but an awful lot of women have got babies , do n't forget that . Including those affiliated bodies . It 's only a little bit of a thing , Belle , but it 's the kind that matters to a candidate . ( She has the bundle open ; extracts the top sheets ) " Ohio Law Reports . 1906 . " They 've sent the wrong year ! PRESCOTT ( Who has opened the other bundle ) This goes up to 1910. p. 112 LUCY They 've sent me the State archives . ( As CHARLES re-enters with the other two bundles ) Hurry up , Charles  --  it must be in one of those ! ( She attacks a bundle ) If it is n't I 'll go crazy ! PRESCOTT ( Still in the second bundle ) What year did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteen . Mary Haggerty versus Cleveland Interurban Railways , Inc.  --  Ohio , 1912  --  ' 13  --  A. L. R.  --  PRESCOTT Here it is ! LUCY ( Excitedly ) Give it to me ! Yes , this is it ! ( Swiftly turning the pages ) public carrier for hire not imputable to a passenger riding in said public carrier really , they put in more talk eminent domain annotation here we are ! BELLE What 's it say ? LUCY Decision of the court liability under constitution my God , they keep on ! in consideration of  --  I 've got it ! Concurred in the result : Sloane , MacKenna , McGivney  --  dissenting  --  Justice Carter Hibbard  --  the dirty dog ! p. 113 BELLE He did n't do it ? LUCY ( In a sunk voice ) He voted for Mary Haggerty . He was the only one that did . The skunk ! ( She drops into a chair . Licked ) BELLE Well , that 's that . LUCY I ca n't believe it . Just a great humanitarian . Weeks in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rings for CHARLES ) PRESCOTT You can take these out again , Charles . CHARLES Yes , Miss . Shall I put them back in the cellar ? LUCY Any place . Burn them . CHARLES Yes , Mrs. Wayne . ( He carries them out ) LUCY Oh , well ! ( An uncomfortable pause ) PRESCOTT Do you want to look over the seating , Lucy ? LUCY What ? PRESCOTT Do you want to look over the seating ? For to-night 's dinner ? LUCY No , I do n't care where they sit . As far as I 'm concerned , I know I 'm going to get the Peruvian Ambassador . He 's been here so long his country 's forgotten him . A typical Washington success story  --  began at the bottom of the dinner table and worked up . p. 114 BELLE ( Mulling it over ) It seems to me it would have been easier to get something on Irene , instead of Carter . LUCY Good Lord , have n't I tried ? You do n't know how I 've tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . LUCY All right , but try to prove them ! Give me one ! There 's nothing I wo n't use  --  you know that . ( She is dispiritedly putting the things back into her bag ) BELLE Well , there was that South American . LUCY That was a week-end party . No hotel register , nothing . BELLE Well , Peyton Noyes . Or I 'll tell you . That Spaniard  --  what was his name ? The charg d'affaires . LUCY He 's back in Madrid  --  who knows about it ? I tell you I 've been over everything . Those years in Slovania , or whatever it 's called  --  when she was married to Gregoravitch  --  there must be something there , but how do you find out ? Even the country 's lost now  --  you ca n't find it since the war . It is n't on the map  --  I looked . There 's no use , Belle  --  she 's going to be First Lady , and that 's that . p. 115 BELLE ( Shaking her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the White House already . Drives Carter to his office every day , walks around the golf links with him  --  LUCY Do n't tell me about it . When I think what it 'll do to Stephen . His whole career . BELLE But surely there 'll always be a place for Stephen . The party ca n't get on without him . LUCY Belle , I ca n't let it happen . I  --  I just ca n't , that 's all . BELLE You know , it 's all wrong , really  --  letting a woman be First Lady just because she happens to be married to a President . LUCY Of course it is . They ought to elect the First Lady and then let her husband be President . BELLE You know what she was doing to-day ? Guest of honor at the Girl Scout House . They were cooking her a model lunch . LUCY Girl Scout ! If I ever see that woman toasting a hot dog , I 'll not be responsible . BELLE Well , every First Lady has to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scouts and the Wayward Girls . She finally plunked for the Scouts . LUCY Too bad  --  she and the Wayward Girls could have had such fun swapping stories . p. 116 BELLE Anyhow , she 's getting all ready for the job . She 's started to tone down the make-up  --  much lighter on the lipstick , and I think she 'll have eyebrows again in another week . LUCY Oh , Belle , I do n't really care about Irene any more  --  it 's gone beyond that . But Carter , Belle ! Carter Hibbard as President ! We ca n't do that to the country ! Even Keane would have been better . Oh , why did you ever tell me about Keane , anyhow ? That 's what started the whole business . BELLE What ? What did that have to do with it ? LUCY ( Realizing she has gone too far ) Nothing . Nothing at all  --  I was just talking . BELLE ( Her eye caught by more fragments from LUCY 's bag ; she picks up the Trans-Bulgania notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It looks like him . LUCY ( Peering over her shoulder ) Yes , it does , does n't it ? BELLE ( Turning it over ) What did you say this was ? Is it important ? LUCY ( As she takes it ) No , not very . Trans-Bulgania . But it 's important to him . p. 117 BELLE Are you going to keep all this junk ? Do you want the rug man ? LUCY ( Absently , as she studies STEPHEN 'S notes ) What ? BELLE Do you want the rug man ? LUCY ( Her eyes still on the notes ) Sophy . PRESCOTT Yes ? LUCY Where 's Trans-Bulgania , exactly ? Do you know ? PRESCOTT ( Vaguely ) Why , no , I do n't . Over there some place . LUCY ( Half to herself ) Thanks . BELLE ( Who has picked a batch of samples from LUCY 's great assortment ) I wonder how this would look on me ? ( Holding a sample to her breast ) ( LUCY , with sudden decision , goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What do you want to know about that for ? BELLE ( Trying another sample  --  a good loud one , this time ) Or do you like this better ? p. 118 LUCY Oh , do n't take that one . I want it for the couch . BELLE No wonder I picked it . LUCY ( The telephone ) State Department ? Ms. Fleming , please . Jason Fleming . BELLE Well , I suppose I 'd better be on my way , or Esther Blodgett will be crazy . LUCY Jason ? This is Lucy Wayne . That 's right . Jason , Secretary Wayne wants to see a copy of the Trans-Bulgania treaty . That 's right . Can you bring it over ? Oh , that 'll be awfully nice of you . As soon as possible . Oh , thanks . Thanks a lot , Jason . ( She hangs up ) PRESCOTT ( Quietly ) What have you got up your sleeve ? LUCY ( Thinking hard ) Sophy-Sophy , listen . Tell Charles that when Jason Fleming comes I want him brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRESCOTT No , it is n't . ( The voices of TOM and STEPHEN are heard in the hall  --  there is no time to argue ) LUCY Well , never mind  --  tell him anyhow . ( She pushes a reluctant SOPHY out of the room , just as the men come in ) p. 119 STEPHEN Hello , there , girls ! LUCY Hello , darling . ( A kiss ) TOM What are you doing here , Belle ? BELLE ( On her way ) Do n't Belle me . Why did n't you tell me all this was going to happen to-day ? That Irene and Carter were coming here ? TOM Did n't know it myself till two hours ago . BELLE Why did n't you phone me ? Irene coming here ! And I 've got to go to Esther Blodgett 's . LUCY Why do n't you stand out on the sidewalk , Belle , and see which one of us comes out alive ? BELLE ( With a sigh ) And to think I 've only got Tom to describe it to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She goes ) STEPHEN Well ! What have you girls been up to ? LUCY Nothing in particular . Oh , before I forget it , Jason Fleming just telephoned . He wants to talk to you about the Trans-Bulgania treaty . He 's bringing it over . STEPHEN ( Considerably puzzled ) Trans-Bulgania . Why , that 's all finished . p. 120 LUCY ( Hastily ) Well , something must have come up . I do n't know what it is . STEPHEN Oh , I guess it 's not important . ( He changes the subject , rather consciously ) Ready to die for your country ? LUCY ( Lightly ) If I have to . STEPHEN ( Very , very serious ) I know this is n't going to be easy for you  --  this afternoon , my dear . I do n't like to ask it . LUCY Why , darling , I do n't mind . How long will I have her ? STEPHEN Well , we 'll do our best . We 've got to fix up an announcement  --  TOM You know  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STEPHEN Anyhow , we 'll hurry it all we can . Okay ? LUCY Okay . STEPHEN That 's the girl . ( A little pat on the shoulder ) How about you , Sophy ? Are you going to be around this afternoon , in case  --  ah  --  PRESCOTT Yes , I 'd planned to . p. 121 STEPHEN That 's fine . ( SOPHY gives a knowing nod as she goes into the drawing room ) LUCY How you trust me ! What do you think , Tom ? Do n't you think he ought to trust me more ? STEPHEN Lucy , I do n't like the way you 're behaving . It makes me nervous when you 're so sweet . LUCY Why , Stephen ! That 's really the most unfair remark . ( The doorbell ) STEPHEN Now-now here they are . Lucy , you 've got to behave . This is very important . To all of us . LUCY ( Sweetly ) Of course , Stephen . TOM What 's she coming here for , anyway ? Why does she have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Carter 's . LUCY Carter 's nothing ! It was hers ! Do you think she 'd miss a chance like this ? STEPHEN Now , you see ! I know that sweetness . Lucy , you 've got to do this for the party . LUCY The party ! I 've got an idea ! We 'll start a new party ! This is the very moment ! p. 122 STEPHEN Now , Lucy ! TOM You ca n't start a new party now , Lucy . They 're coming up the stairs . LUCY Oh , well , I suppose not . But something ought to be done . Oh , do n't worry , Stephen  --  I 'll behave . How can I do anything else ? ( She kisses him ) ( CHARLES appears in the hallway ) CHARLES Right in here , please . ( Enter IRENE HIBBARD , followed immediately by CARTER and GANNING ) LUCY Irene , how nice ! I 'm so glad to see you ! IRENE ( With just the right note of graciousness ) Good afternoon , Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hello , there , Carter ! " " Stephen . " " Ganning , how are you ? " ) LUCY Well , Carter , this is an honor . CARTER ( With a new resonance ) How do you do , Lucy ? LUCY ( Approaching GANNING ) And Warwick , the king maker ! We are indeed honored . GANNING Now , Mrs. Wayne ! p. 123 STEPHEN ( Indicating a chair ) Do sit down , Irene . IRENE Oh , thanks , Stephen . LUCY ( Waving HIBBARD to a chair ) Carter . CARTER ( Sitting rather heavily ) Oh , thank you . ( GANNING too finds a chair ) STEPHEN Do n't get too comfortable , you fellows . We 've got work to do . LUCY Oh , now , you can talk to us a minute . How about tea , or do you want something weaker ? Carter ? CARTER Ah  --  not now , thank you . STEPHEN We 'll have ours upstairs . LUCY Oh , very well . The men will have some drinks upstairs , Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope you did n't mind my coming along  --  do you , Stephen ? STEPHEN Why , of course not , Irene . I 'm delighted . IRENE I felt I must be with him at this wonderful moment , this turning point in our lives . And I think he wanted me to be here . ( She turns to CARTER ) Did n't you , dear ? p. 124 CARTER What ? Oh , yes . Yes , my dear . ( He indulges in a little important throat clearing ) GANNING I tell you , a man is only half a man when he stands alone . It takes a woman to fill him out . Do n't you agree with me , Mrs. Wayne ? LUCY Oh , yes . Yes , indeed . ( She smiles graciously at IRENE ) Certainly you 've filled Carter out . STEPHEN ( A bit too high , by way of saving the situation ) Anyhow , here we all are ! Seems to me we 're coming out with this at just the right time  --  psychological moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ganning ? GANNING I think so . Of course , catching a newspaper reader is a very delicate operation . Very delicate . LUCY What do you use ? Salt ? GANNING No , no . But recently we conducted a scientific inquiry : Who is the most popular person in America ? LUCY How interesting ! GANNING And what was the result ? The winners were Father Coughlin and Shirley Temple . LUCY Well , then the thing for Carter to do is to turn his collar around and wear curls . p. 125 STEPHEN ( Again the life-saver ) Had n't we better go upstairs now ? All ready ? GANNING Yes , yes , of course . CARTER ( As he rises ) At your service , gentlemen . GANNING ( Facing the ancestral portrait ) You know , it seems eminently fitting that our announcement should be made from this very house , the home of Andrew Chase . Eh , Hardwick ? TOM I suppose so . CARTER ( Also lost in the portrait ) I hope , Mrs. Wayne , that I 'm able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can . But of course it was the other end of grandfather that mattered . STEPHEN ( To GANNING , as they go out ) What time do we have to give this out to catch the morning papers ? GANNING Oh , there 's no hurry . I 've told our man to wait for it . CARTER ( Who finds himself paired with HARDWICK as he approaches the hallway ) I took the liberty of preparing a preliminary anouncement . Sort of a tentative outline . ( From his brief case he brings the preliminary draft  --  a manuscript just a little shorter than " Anthony Adverse " ) p. 126 TOM ( Taking the manuscript in his hand and appraising its weight ) Hey , Stephen ! Where 's your bathroom scales ? ( The men are all gone ) LUCY ( As CHARLES puts down the tea things ) Thank you , Charles . ( CHARLES bows and goes ) Let me see . You take  --  ah  --  IRENE Just a little lemon , please . LUCY Oh , yes . Lemon . Well ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two of us ! IRENE Oh , much . ( As though waiting for just this dangerous moment , which indeed she has been , SOPHY enters . She pulls up a chair and sits quietly down . The watchdog ) LUCY ( In mock greeting ) How do you do , Sophy ? PRESCOTT ( With a nice formality ) How do you do ? LUCY Will you have some tea ? PRESCOTT No , thank you . LUCY Lemon ? PRESCOTT No , thanks . p. 127 LUCY Perhaps a spoon ? PRESCOTT No , thank you . LUCY I see . Well ! ( Hands IRENE her tea ) Irene ? ( At the same moment she gets a glimpse of CHARLES in the hallway ) Oh , Charles ! CHARLES Yes , madam ? LUCY Pardon me , Irene . Ms. Fleming is n't here yet , is he ? CHARLES Not yet , madam . LUCY Well , be sure to let me know . CHARLES Yes , madam . IRENE Ah , if you only knew how heavenly it is to have a quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Receiving this person and that . When I allow myself to think of what 's ahead of me , it  --  it rather overwhelms me . LUCY Nonsense ! You must n't feel that way about it . With your years of experience . IRENE Ah , but it 's a real challenge  --  a challenge to any woman . Because I do n't think the White House has ever been done properly , do you ? LUCY ( Leaning forward , rapt ) How 's that ? p. 128 IRENE Oh , I do n't mean any reflection , my dear , but no one has ever preserved all its democratic traditions  --  because after all , this is a democracy  --  and still given it the flavor and distinction of a European court . Which it should have . Because Europe sees us through her diplomats ' eyes , and judges accordingly . You see , having lived abroad for so many years , I know . LUCY Oh , yes , I 'd forgotten about that . Whatever became of that country , anyhow ? It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a sigh ) Oh , that horrible war ! What it did to Slovania ! Poor Gregoravitch lost everything  --  it was only a year after we were married . LUCY Dear me ! He did n't keep it long , did he ? PRESCOTT ( Doing just a little bit of rescue work ) For my part , I think it will be very nice  --  having someone in the White House who really knows the ropes . I know it will make my life easier . LUCY Oh , I 'm sure it will , Sophy . ( She turns to IRENE ) You know , Sophy does n't care who makes the laws of a nation , so long as the dinners are correctly seated . IRENE At least that 's one thing you wo n't have to worry about for the next four years , Lucy  --  where you sit at the dinner table . Because , of course , you 're not remaining in Washington ? p. 129 LUCY I beg your pardon ? IRENE Really , I do n't know what we 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington without the monument . Because to most people you have become a monument . LUCY Why , that 's sweet of you , Irene . IRENE I 'm sure you 'll find it such a relief  --  living back in New York again , where no one will notice you . It 'll be so restful just to be nobody . LUCY Well , of course you know more about that than I do . IRENE Where you can do anything you like without having it matter . Where every time anyone says something witty it wo n't be attributed to you  --  unjustly , or course . LUCY Some more lemon , Irene ? IRENE No , thank you . And Stephen , too . Freed from the pressure of public life . I do hope he 'll find something to interest him . LUCY It 's awfully good of you , Irene , to have thought so much about us . IRENE Oh , not at all . LUCY Because it is n't what happens to us , of course  --  it 's what happens to you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are n't we ? p. 130 LUCY Oh , but you 'll be most important . Was that the door-bell ? Did I hear the doorbell ? PRESCOTT No , you did n't . LUCY Yes , Irene , you do n't realize how important you will be . IRENE ( Coolly ) I think I understand everything that the position entails . LUCY Oh , you ca n't possibly , Irene . Not until you 've actually been in it  --  or at least seen it at close range . Of course a lot of it 's wonderful  --  really wonderful  --  but you pay for it in the long run . Of course you and Carter will have to be together just the whole four years  --  you realize that , do n't you ? IRENE Well , I 'm sure I wo n't mind that . LUCY Oh , wait ! Wait till you have to campaign with him , and get up at all hours to receive bunches of wilted flowers from little girls at railway stations . Wait till you have to go to funerals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And launchings ! My dear , they just never launch a battleship on a nice day  --  it 's like open-air Shakespearean performances  --  you catch your death of cold every time . ( SOPHY , who sees her starting , gives an admonitory little cough . It passes quite unheeded ) Really , Irene , I must say I admire you for taking this on . There are so many points to consider . You take clothes alone  --  all those Paris frocks of yours . They 're out , right from the beginning . ( There is a stronger and more marked cough from SOPHY ) You 've got to buy American , and you know what that means . The simplest things  --  that 's really all you can wear . Going to the White House is like going to boarding school  --  all you can take is your rubbers , and your raincoat , and two towels marked with your initials . ( SOPHY coughs again  --  still stronger ) Why do n't you take something for that , Sophy ? Really , it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Day  --  standing there forever and forever . ( She waves a limp wrist by way of illustration ) ( And at this moment the doorbell rings . LUCY fairly leaps on it ) Ah ! Charles ! Charles ! The doorbell ! ( She makes sure that CHARLES is on his way before she resumes ) And the musicales ! Hours and hours on those little gilt chairs  --  they leave a red line across you , right here . ( She indicates the approximate spot ) p. 131 IRENE Really , Lucy , you 're being absurd ! LUCY Oh , but that is n't the worst of it . It 's those years after you leave the White House  --  they 're what really hurt . Because there is n't any place to go after that . And you ca n't lie about your age any more , because a hundred and thirty million people know all about you . Once you 've lived in the White House you 're a dated egg . IRENE ( Her back against the wall ) You seem to be having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that you go ahead and have it now . CHARLES ( Appearing in the hallway ) Mr. Fleming is here , madam . LUCY Oh , fine . Have him come right in , Charles . He can wait in here . You do n't mind , do you , Irene ? Jason Fleming . IRENE Not in the least . CHARLES But he asked to see the Secretary , madam . LUCY Well , that 's all right . He can wait in here . How about some more tea ? Do n't you want some more tea ? IRENE No , thank you . LUCY ( Nibbling at a cake ) These little things are awfully good , are n't they ? I 'm quite hungry . ( JASON FLEMING appears ) Oh , hello , Jason . Come right in. p. 132 FLEMING Mrs. Wayne . Oh , how do you do , Mrs. Hibbard ? Miss Prescott . IRENE How do you do ? LUCY You do n't mind waiting a few minutes , do you ? The Secretary 's in conference . FLEMING Not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I 'm not in the way . LUCY Why , of course not . Just the contrary . Will you have some tea ? Or are you above that ? FLEMING Oh , thank you very much . IRENE Sophy , I wonder if you could find out if the men are nearly finished . LUCY Oh , do n't hurry off , Irene  --  we 've only begun to talk . Lemon or cream , Jason ? FLEMING Cream , please . LUCY Why do men always take cream ? I believe they think lemon is effeminate or something  --  you know , dainty little pieces like this . ( With a pair of tongs she holds a sliver of lemon aloft ) FLEMING Well , cream is n't so virile either . LUCY Well , Jason , what 's happening at the State Department these days ? ( She addresses IRENE ) You know , Jason gives me all the gossip  --  I never can get a word out of Stephen . Come on , Jason . We want the inside . p. 133 FLEMING Well , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call at the White House yesterday , and had a twenty-minute audience with the President . LUCY Well ? That was all right , was n't it ? FLEMING Oh , fine . Except that Egypt has n't got a Crown Princess . LUCY Oh , dear ! FLEMING Of course that raised a pretty rumpus . How she got by everybody , I do n't know . It seemed it was the State Department 's fault , as usual . LUCY Anyhow , the Balkans are behaving these days . That 's your chief worry , usually . FLEMING Yes , they 're fine . LUCY Stephen tells me the Trans  --  Bulgania treaty is all ready for signing . That must be a relief to you . FLEMING Yes , that 'll be a red  --  letter day , all right  --  when that 's signed . We 've been on it a year . LUCY I know  --  it seems forever that Stephen 's been talking about it . I 'd no idea it was so important . FLEMING Oh , it is n't , exactly . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Business men know where they stand , for example  --  we do n't have to answer a lot of questions every day . Such as : If I import tiddly  --  winks sets from Trans  --  Bulgania , do I have to stamp " Made in Trans  --  Bulgania " on every tiddly  --  wink ? p. 134 LUCY Well , it goes further than that , does n't it ? I was just taking a look at Stephen 's notes  --  does n't it have something to do with marriage laws , too ? FLEMING Yes , it covers everything . It just means that from now on they recognize our laws and we recognize theirs . And boy ! they 've got some funny ones . Church and State are just like that over there . ( He holds up two fingers in close juxtaposition ) LUCY ( Thoughtfully ) Trans-Bulgania . Where is that , anyhow ? FLEMING Oh , it 's one of those jigsaw puzzle countries that they put together after the war . It 's a union of four pre war States , really . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces that did n't fit any place else . FLEMING That 's right . Their old names were  --  ah  --  Carpathia , Vladisoya , Hohlenburg , and Slovania . LUCY ( Salvation in sight ) Really ? Did you say Slovania ? FLEMING Oh , yes , indeed . Slovania is the largest of the four . LUCY Why , is n't that interesting ? Irene , did you know that ? ( CHARLES appears ) p. 135 CHARLES I beg pardon , Ms. Fleming . The Secretary wants to know if you 'll come up now . FLEMING Oh , thank you , Charles . If you 'll excuse me  --  LUCY Wait a minute , Jason . Tell me  --  you mean we never had a treaty with them before ? Slovania . FLEMING No . Sounds funny , but we did n't . LUCY Well  --  what did we do ? Suppose something happened to an American over there , what did we do ? FLEMING Well , nothing , really . So far as we were concerned , it did n't happen . LUCY You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephen 's notes-it said something about divorce . You mean , if somebody was divorced over there , that we did n't recognize it ? FLEMING That 's right . Of course it 'll be different from now on . LUCY Then if she married someone else afterwards , would that mean  --  FLEMING Well , strictly speaking , she could n't do it . It would n't be a marriage . LUCY But if she went ahead and did it anyhow , then she 's been  --  ( She rolls the phrase pleasurably on her tongue )  --  living in sin ? p. 136 FLEMING That 's right . ( A light laugh ) So you see we needed a treaty . LUCY Yes . FLEMING Pardon me . ( He goes ) ( IRENE , of course , has stood riveted as this revelation has come forth . A caged tigress ) ( For a moment the two women face each other , while a white-faced SOPHY stands in the back-ground ) IRENE You  --  would n't  --  dare ! LUCY Would n't dare what ? IRENE Would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on in that devilish mind of yours ! It 's a lie ! A lie , I tell you ! And I can prove it ! LUCY Oh , no , you ca n't ! You 've been living with Carter Hibbard all these years without being married to him , and that 's all there is to it . Of course , why you would want to do that , I have n't any idea . IRENE It 's not true ! Because this little squirt comes in here and says so  --  it 's nothing but a technicality , that 's all it is ! LUCY Technicality or not , wait till the opposition paper comes out with dates , and names , and places  --  with your marriage to Gregoravitch and a phony divorce ! And photostatic copies of the phony divorce ! With an interview with Gregoravitch , and another with his four wives-I 'm sure the one that 's in the movies will talk-and pictures , pictures ! They 'll print pictures of everything except you and Carter-ah-you know-and they may even print those ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will matter . You could explain till you were blue in the face , but the damage will be done . Because if a man 's going to run for President of the United States , there must n't be even a whisper about him ! And you know it ! p. 137 IRENE It's-it 's an outrage ! It 's unfair ! LUCY All right , it 's unfair . But it 'll do the trick , just the same . How about the Church vote ? Why , the party would be crazy to go ahead with him . IRENE ( Taking a long moment ) I 've got to think about it . I 've got to have time . LUCY No . He 's got to tell them to-day . This afternoon . IRENE I know why you 're doing this . Do n't think I do n't . You want it yourself , that 's why . You want it for Stephen . You 've always been in my way , wherever I turned . You 've traded on that family name of yours-you think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looks at the portrait ) What was he , anyhow ? Nothing but a dirty politician ! And so are you ! LUCY ( Quite pleased ) You bet I am . Or you 'd be in the White House . ( The men loom up in the hallway-STEPHEN , GANNING , HARDWICK , HIBBARD ) STEPHEN Well , the die is cast-meet the candidate ! ( At the first sight of HIBBARD , IRENE darts quickly to him . Without a word , she pulls him into the drawing room ) p. 138 FLEMING ( In the hallway ) Good-bye , Ms. Secretary ! STEPHEN Good-bye , Jason . Sorry your trip was in vain . FLEMING Oh , that 's all right . Good-bye , Mrs. Wayne . LUCY Oh , good-bye , Jason ! And thank you very much . ( He disappears ) ( LUCY , apparently for no reason at all , bursts into song-probably a bit of Italian opera ) STEPHEN For God 's sake , Lucy-what 's the matter with you ? LUCY Not a thing ! I 'm the happiest girl in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same way . LUCY ( On high ) Yes , but not for the same reason ! GANNING Where is Carter , anyhow ? STEPHEN Yes , where is he ? GANNING ( Peering into the next room ) Oh , I see him . Carter ! LUCY Yes , you 'd better keep an eye on him . Because he may go out the window . GANNING How 's that ? p. 139 LUCY Nothing , nothing ! I did n't say anything . GANNING Carter ! Carter ! ( CARTER HIBBARD returns from the drawing room , followed at some distance by IRENE . He advances with a solemnity that at once arrests the attention of the others . His face is white ) GANNING What 's the matter ? Do n't you feel well ? CARTER ( Painfully ) Gentlemen  --  I do n't quite know how to tell you this . I thought that I had been fully restored  --  to health  --  but I regret to announce that  --  my stomach has gone back on me . Gentlemen , I am not a candidate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " from STEPHEN , a surprised look from HARDWICK ) GANNING You 're crazy ! What are you talking about ? CARTER I simply say that I do not feel equal to the strain of a Presidential campaign . GANNING But we 've got everything ready . What 's got into you ? CARTER No , Ellsworth . No . Do n't try to dissuade me . I have made up my mind , and there is no appeal from my decision . Are you coming , Irene ? ( IRENE waits for a minute  --  surveying the room belligerently . Then HIBBARD calls her a second time ) Irene ! p. 140 IRENE ( Through her teeth ) Yes ! ( She is gone ) ( A bewildered GANNING looks around at the others ) GANNING I must say I do n't understand that , do you ? STEPHEN ( Slowly ) No , I do n't . ( His eyes go to Lucy , who is all innocence ) Just how did the Trans-Bulgania treaty fit in ? LUCY ( With a smile ) You 're not old enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of leaves you out on a limb , does n't it , Ganning ? A king maker , and no king . GANNING It 's  --  it 's monstrous . What are we going to do ? TOM You know damned well what we 're going to do ! There 's your candidate , right there ! And he has n't got a stomach either ! STEPHEN Why , thank you , Tom . That 's one of the nicest things I 've ever had said about me . ( Turning to Lucy , who is already on the verge of tears ) Do n't cry , do n't cry ! I have n't been elected yet . LUCY Kiss me anyway . ( STEPHEN Kisses Lucy ) p. 141 TOM So what do you say , Ganning ? Here 's your chance to get aboard the bandwagon . GANNING ( Taking in the situation ) Ah  --  yes . Yes . You understand , Ms. Secretary , I do n't want anything for myself , but Mrs. Ganning has always wanted to live in England . So if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited , appears in the door-way with KEANE ) PAIGE ( Unable to contain herself ) I 've just got to tell you-all ! Oh , excuse me , Ms. Ganning . I kind of forgot  --  GANNING ( Abstracted ) Ah  --  how 's that ? PAIGE Well  --  we 're engaged ! LUCY What ? PAIGE Gordon and I ! We 're going to be married ! LUCY Emmy ! Oh , my darling !
