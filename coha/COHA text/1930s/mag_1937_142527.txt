The Duke of Norfolk , the Archbishop of Canterbury and 350 Officers of the Gold Staff who will act as ushers at the Abbey Ceremony , last week made a tour of 100 toilets in remodeled Westminster Abbey . These have been specially built for the convenience of Britain 's aristocracy privileged to remain in the Abbey without a chance of escape for six and one-half hours . A jesting officer of the Gold Staff ordered all the cisterns to be tested together . As a workman obeyed the command , the Archbishop protested : " Tut , tut , that will never do . It 's just like Niagara ! " <P> Top-hatted West-Enders returning from their revels loitered in the chilly streets of London early last Sunday morning to watch the Duke of Norfolk 's partly-dressed rehearsal of the Coronation procession . Thousands of others rose from their beds while it was still dark , turned out to get a better idea of what happens when a British monarch is crowned than most of them will get on the day of the ceremony . At 6:16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the four-ton gilded coach , similar to that in which King George &; Queen Elizabeth will ride , rolled along behind eight horses with its Household Cavalry escort , policemen and soldiers snapped their heels to attention . Outside the Abbey , the procession halted while an imaginary Coronation service unwound itself , and officials with furrowed brows peered at stopwatches . On the cavalcade 's return journey any wisps of sleep that still hovered over the 200,000 sightseers were swept away by the rousing brass of massed bands . Because the procession took 30 minutes longer than the schedule allows there was many an anxious head-to-head in the Duke of Norfolk 's Buckingham Gate office this week as schemes for pruning a few seconds here and there were solemnly discussed .
