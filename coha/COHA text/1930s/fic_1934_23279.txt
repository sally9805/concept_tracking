THE SECOND STEP A STORY BY MARGERY SHARP THE car hummed smoothly round the last bend , and as the walls of the villa began to appear through the trees , young Druten put on the brake and dropped to twenty . It was a moment , he felt , to be taken slowly ; and from the tail of his eye he could see his wife 's small distinguished head lifting eagerly beside him . Slowing down still more , Druten glanced back into the car , where a Chinese manservant and two little boys were wedged among the baggage . One small boy was Chinese , son of the servant , the other American , and son of the master . " Is this it , Fu Lin ? " asked Druten over his shoulder Fu Lin nodded . He was quite young , about the same age as his master , but with emotion so wrinkling his face he might have been anything up to a hundred . " Looks just like his father ! " thought young Druten suddenly ; and for an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder and holding by a ropy tail of hair . The car turned in under palm trees and followed a wide sandy drive . After the fashion of that coast , the Villa Caterina stood sheerly against the sea , all its gardens in front and at the back only a broad stone terrace over the blue Mediterranean . At the end of the drive , before a loggia of white stone , Druten brought the carto a standstill and helped his wife to get out . They were both a little still , but neither of them noticed it ; like Fu Lin , they were filled with a deep , an almost sacred emotion . They gazed on the white stone walls , and their hearts thumped within them ; for this was their ancestral home that had been in the family for two generations , and it contained , besides the famous picture gallery , an heirloom of such extraordinary interest and value that the Drutens went straight off to look for it before even glancing at the Rembrandts . For the Rembrandts proved merely what everyone knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas the cross carved in the stone proved something known to hardly anyone at all  --  namely , that Old Man Druten had had a redeeming feature . Of Old Man Druten 's early life  --  until he fetched up East , that is , and married a wife out of the First Four Thousand  --  the undisputed facts amounted to no more than these : that between the ages of thirty and forty he made money in San Francisco , in which city four young Chinamen , otherwise of good character , made four separate attempts to assassinate him . All the rest ( as his wife 's family pointed out ) was mere rumor . With a fine contempt for gossip , Old Man Druten hired a bodyguard and went on making money . He made it out of drugstores , at about the same time that the republics of South America were beginning to acquire their taste for Chinese women . The rumors increasing , Old Man Druten strengthened his bodyguard and opened a new drugstore ; but ill-luck was dogging him , for on the very day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the loss of a daughter , went and committed suicide on the new marble floor . It was at this point that Druten showed his metal . He went straight to the old man 's son and offered him the post of valet and body-servant at an extremely adequate salary . The son mused awhile in filial piety , consulted his gods , and made a number of stipulations , among them being this , that he should bring along with him his own infant son and heir , a small boy of two years , yellow as butter and answering , like his sire , to the name of Fu Lin . Druten agreed : he would have agreed to anything . Fu Lin pondered again , pushed up the salary by one hundred per cent , and finally accepted . With such an answer to slanderous tongues  --  the son of the dead man his most trusted servant  --  Old Druten spent six months longer in San Francisco ; but though no more attempts were made on his life , the time was spent chiefly in winding up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retiring on an income which placed him well up in the second flight of American millionaires . He was n't a Rockefeller , but he could give his wife Rembrandts . After the marriage , curiously enough  --  for Old Druten was scarcely a man of cosmopolitan culture  --  they settled in Europe , buying a large , rather beautiful villa on the shores of the Mediterranean . It had gardens on three sides and at the back a wide stone terrace , from the end of which a short steep flight of steps  --  the second , in those days , unmarked byany cross  --  ran straight down to the water . Here Mrs. Druten hung her pictures , received the local aristocracy , and in due course gave birth to a son ; and here , after an uncommonly chequered career , Old Man Druten managed to die , if not actually in his bed , at any rate in a thoroughly domestic and affecting manner . It happened in this way , that descending the terrace steps late one night  --  he was fond of being rowed about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters  --  his old man 's foot slipped on the second stair and he slid quietly as a fish into the deep of the bay . Fu Lin , who was already standing in the boat , instantly dived after , crying out as he did so to arouse the house . His call carried far across the water ; a second later , from both house and village , lights flared suddenly and a confusion of voices cried from one to the other . Fishing boats put out , and all night long Fu Lin dived again and again , until in the early morning he had to be carried bodily to his bed . He was fainting with exhaustion , but they had to lock his door ; the first time they left him he came dragging himself forth and prepared to dive again . But not till three days later was the body found . Nor in the end did Fu Lin find it , but a lad from a strange fishing boat who came fresh and strong and spent one whole afternoon diving from the terrace wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot of the steps , a deep and unsuspected gully in the rock ; and in this gully the body had lain wedged while the boats passed above and Fu Lin cleft open water . They hauled Old Man Druten up and buried him under marble in the nearest Protestant cemetery ; and a month later Fu Lin was dead too . He had done his work , he said , and saw no reason to go on living ; but before he died he sat two consecutive days at the bottom of the terrace stairs , there carving out , on the second step , a big Christian cross in memory of his master . " There it is , James , " said Mrs. Druten softly . They stared down in silence . They had expected it , yet not expected it , and now there it was , greened over a little by seaweed , but yet an unmistakable cross cut deep into the rock . " And if a man 's valet does n't know the truth , who does ? " asked Stella Druten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . it just proves he was good at heart . " Young Druten drew a long breath . " I believe I remember it , " he said . " Anyway , I remember mother bringing me here , and seeing old Fu Lin squatted below , and then a day or two later her telling me that he 'd gone away . . . . " Druten cleared his throat and , reaching up to a big stone urn , broke off a couple of sprays of sweet geranium . " What they used to call a broken heart , I suppose . At any rate the doctors could n't find anything wrong . But he died all the same , and his body went back home in a first-class coffin . " In the long pause that followed they heard for the first time the light , regular lapping of the green water . It sounded peaceful , friendly ; it belonged with the still sunlight and the smell of flowers . Stella Druten slipped her hand through her husband 's arm and pressed it softly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him too . It 's strange , is n't it ? ? your father and Fu Lin 's , then you and our Fu Lin himself , and now Jimmy and little Charles . . .. I wish they 'd called him Fu Lin as well . That makes three generations , James . " Young Druten nodded . " I guess it 's just how the Southerners must feel about their old darkies . They look on them as part of the family , andthe darkies feel it too . They  --  I do n't know how it is  --  they sort of keep up the family traditions , and Fu Lin 's the same . This place , for instance , he loves as though it were his own home ; if it had n't been for him I might never have come back here , but he used to talk about it and remind me of it till he made me homesick too . Mother used to tell me that when she shut up the house and went home he was so brokenhearted that she offered to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped at it , I guess , if he had n't had me to look after . " His wife smiled back at him . " Just how old were you both , honey ? " " I was six and Fu Lin was eight . But he took himself very seriously . His father had told him to look after me , you see , and he was sure going to do it . He did it for the next twelve years at a stretch , right until I went to College ; and then as they did n't encourage valets at Harvard , he seized the opportunity to go back to ' Frisco , marry a wife , and beget a son . The day I graduated , back he came , bringing the two-year with him , and though he did n't actually put it into words , I gathered that I now had his permission to marry as soon as I liked . " The pressure on his arm tightened . " But what about his wife ? " asked Mrs. Druten . " Did n't she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she died when Charles was born . But somehow their women did n't seem to bother them , " said young Druten simply . " As long as they have us to look after nothing else counts . We do n't deserve it , of course , but there it is ; and as an awful consequence , darling , I 've an inherited tendency to quote Gunga Din . " He spoke lightly , but the tale had moved him nevertheless ; and as they turned to go he dropped back a moment and with a swift , half-furtive gesture tossed a spray of sweet geranium on to the still water . Like many other Americans of the same age , class , and fortune , the Drutens had early turned their backs on the land of their fathers . Their true , their spiritual home was Europe , and it was with a genuine sensation of relief that they unpacked their trunks and settled down for life at the Villa Caterina . During the first six months there they made only two excursions , one to Oberammergau and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too delicious to leave ; and all their guests agreed with them . For there were guests by the dozen , many of them French or Italian , but many more from the States ; and whereas the French and Italians were always led straight to the picture gallery , the Americans , especially those in a hurry , were swiftly shepherded toward the terrace steps . Old Man Druten was still pretty widely remembered , but the sight of the cross and the tale of his servant 's devotion never failed to make their effect . The story would be passed on in Paris , repeated on the boat , and finally spread far and wide through every State in the Union ; and of all the visiting troop not one failed to remark on the intriguingly feudal atmosphere provided by Fu Lin and his son . And indeed , without in any way obtruding themselves , the grave young Chinaman and the little yellow boy attracted at least as much attention as either of the Rembrandts . They shared in OW Druten 's romantic history , and indeed were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , standing side by side at the top of the terrace steps : the boy gazing solemnly downward , and his father explaining , in slow guttural phrases , the meaning of the carved cross . For they still spoke to each other in Chinese , and the Drutens , without understanding a syllable , thoroughly appreciated the exotic effect . Their son , they hoped , might possibly pick up a word or two , for like a royal whipping-boy , little Chinese Charles did lessons with Jimmy Druten , played with him in the garden , and slept next door to the nursery as Fu Lin himself slept next to Jimmy 's father . The child was a body-servant in the making , and followed in the steps of his fathers with true oriental piety . " The way he just worships Jimmy is getting too ridiculous , " Mrs. Druten used to say laughingly ; and visitor after visitor , glancing out from the window , would see a little white boy hitting a ball while a little yellow boy scrambled after . At games in general Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pitching of stones . He could pitch a smooth round pebble plumb on to a five-franc piece at a distance of thirty paces , and Druten now and then had thoughts that as the lad grew older he might be trained as a bowler and play for the M.C.C . For Druten , unlike his wife , who remained faithful to the Continent , had quickly got past being cosmopolitan and was now inclined to the exclusively British . The boys also did lessons together , and in the schoolroom too young Charles moved at a respectful distance behind his companion . Only his hands were clever : with pen or brush . he could do anything he pleased , write a flowing Italian script or draw big black ideographs on a scroll of silky paper . His hands then were beautiful , moving with calm , delicate assurance , and handling almost with tenderness the materials of his art . Nor was the tenderness a matter of seeming only , for when , one day toward the end of the fifth month , there was found on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin yellow fingers dropped scroll and brushes and worked like magic over the shattered bone . With his father 's help little Charles made splints half a match long and bandages a centimeter wide ; and presently the bird could walk about the terrace and preen its sound wing . For seven days the improvement continued , but on the eighth , while the boys were at their lessons , a rat found and killed it . So after that Charles had an enemy , and the throwing-stones whizzed vainly two or three times a day . Thus the pleasant life went on , unique ( said the visitors ) in its mingling of cosmopolitan culture and the joys of domesticity , until one afternoon an odd thing happened . It was the hour of the siesta , but Druten , though stretched out on a couch , found himself unable to rest . Ile got up , drank some water , and went to the window which , like those of all the other principal rooms , looked out over the sea . For perhaps five minutes he stood there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether to lie down again ; and then , on the terrace below , something caught his attention . Impervious as ever to the midday heat , little yellow-skinned Charles had come out of the passage door and was lying in wait for his enemy the rat . He had with him his favorite throwing-stones , a pair of big yellowish pebbles polished and rounded by the sea : and as Druten watched , the boy settled himself in the shadow , motionless as a statue , his eyes roving from edge to edge of the sun-dried shrubs . He had not long to wait . Almost at once , on the far side of the terrace , a bunch of foliage quivered slightly . It made a compact blot of shadow , vandyked at the edge to a pattern of leaves ; and as Druten and the boy watched , the blot began slowly to change shape . One of the leaf-points Was stretching itself out , it was whiskered on either side , it had two bright eyes ; and soon a whole separate and complete outline had detached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careless in the noonday sun . Hardly daring to move , lest the beast should hear and take warning , Druten turned his eyes on the other shadow , till then still motionless as the wall behind it ; and in that moment a hand flicked up and the pebble flew . The rat writhed once over and then lay still , while from its broken head a small red blotch crept out over the stone . " Hough ! " grunted Charles . And Druten , with lips half-open to shout applause , closed them again and held his peace ; for there was something in the child 's demeanor that seemed to show that the business was not yet finished . Without any sign of triumph the boy came slowly across the terrace , picked up the creature by the tail , and flung it contemptuously into the sea : then squatting down by the bloodstain took out a big single-bladed pocket-knife and began scraping at the stone . For half an hour , never raising his head , he scraped and scraped at the patch between his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian cross scratched deep into the rock . This incident Druten found curiously disturbing . It started during the next few days all sorts of odd speculations , which , because he did not share them with anyone , gradually took possession of his mind . It bothered him , for instance , that the same symbol should have been used to commemorate both friend and enemy , and turning this problem idly in his head , he presently found himself embarked on a second train of thought at least as disturbing as the first . He began to recollect certain vague but unsavory rumors , which in San Francisco at any rate seemed still to cling about his father 's name . Young Druten had visited that city but once when , at his mother 's wish , he set up the Druten Memorial Fountain ; and on account of those same malicious whispers he had not enjoyed his stay . Sheer rumor , of course ; but there was also the witnessed fact of those four attempts on Old Man Druten 's life : which would seem to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously . . " Only  --  the whole thing 's fantastic ! " said Druten aloud . It was nearly two in the morning ; for once , sitting alone in the big lounge , he had heard all the household go off to bed . Directly overhead his wife 's footsteps passed gently down the corridor , she was going her rounds , looking first into the night-nursery , where Jimmy slept , then into Charles 's room next door . Neither boy was awake to-night , for the footsteps passed on with hardly a pause ; and the gentle shutting of her own door was the last sound in the house . In the moments that passed while he listened young Druten 's thoughts seemed suddenly to have raced ahead . He had left off at a general consideration of the San Francisco rumors and now found himself faced ( with no intermediate step that he could remember ) by a question so cut-and-dried in its brutality as to seem more like the fruit of a lifelong suspicion than of a three-days ' doubt . The question was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Druten 's service with the deliberate intention of murdering him , why had he waited ? Why not have done it at once , in San Francisco ? Answer : Because in San Francisco Old Druten still had a bodyguard ; because in San Francisco his death would at once have cast suspicion on the whole Chinese community . Because ? more slowly , more reluctantly , thethird reason presented itself  --  because at that time Old Druten had not yet begotten a son . " I 'm going crazy , " young Druten assured himself . " I 've got a touch of the sun .. . . " In the hall outside a clock chimed the hour . Grateful as at the lifting of a spell , he pulled himself out of the chair , loosened his shoulders , and with a conscious effort directed his mind to the tidying of the room . Two o'clock in the morning  --  just the time for wild imaginings ! He plumped up a cushion , straightened a chair : the servants in the morning would be surprised at such neatness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folding of a paper ; it had wandered twenty-odd years back , to the night on the terrace when Old Druten met his end . An impressive scene it was , with lights and outcry and a faithful servant hurling himself again and again into the waters of the bay ; but for its earliest and most crucial moments  --  for what really happened first on the steps and then under water , where Fu Lin could swim like a fish  --  for all that there was only Fu Lin 's own word . No one had doubted it ; no one had asked , for example , any questions about times ; and with a margin of no more than a few minutes , the old man might have been drowned and dead and wedged into the gully before ever the alarm was sounded .... " Fantasticl " said young Druten again . He picked up a handkerchief of his wife 's , a picture-book of Jimmy 's : from the handkerchief came a faint smell of chypre , but for the first time since his marriage the perfume brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with a final look behind him , Druten went out into the hall and closed the door . in the extreme stillness the clock ticked heavily . It now showed a quarter past : but instead of FREEDOM AND labor invented what was later to become another form of slavery . At this stage , remember , there was less opportunity to choose one 's form of work . Freedom of movement was also limited . The forests , literally as well as figuratively , were largely chopped down and most of the forage had been garnered or protected . There were no more open spaces . The cultivated and settled West was becoming industrial . So the workers invented for their protection the new form of slavery known as the trade union . Operating as it did , with large masses , the trade union must adjust itself first to the average , finally to the lowest denominator . It was bound to destroy individualism . To protect the millions of workers who could not help themselves and were forced to low wages and long hours , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus it became difficult for the man who was in a position to advance himself without hurt by extra work to do this work The trade union would not let him lest it alter the norm . The union must also work strenuously to prevent men from asserting individualism by staying out of the union ; for the strength of the union depended upon numbers and upon killing independent competition . The union further limited choice . A member was not permitted to work in more than one trade , and we all know the absurd strictures this developed , forbidding , for example , a steam fitter to apply his wrench , even in an emergency , to a plumber 's province or , further , forbidding a man to make repairs on his own house . So , with the unions , while they protected the mass of workers from oppression and , incidentally , limited also the right of an employer to choose his men and decide their pay , the last trace of the right to work when and how one pleased , disappeared . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less Americanized . With them they had brought certain living standards , certain feudal traditions , certain political conceptions which ardent Americanization may partially have overcome , but of which some color must certainly remain to prejudice the pure idea of American individualism and undoubtedly make more difficult the policies of Washington and Monroe on isolation and European entanglements . The political concept of an American republic as the framers of the Constitution conceived it was eminent in the world 's gallery of such images . It provided for a group of sovereignties bound in a specific allegiance to the federation . Each sovereignty followed , politically , the pattern of the federation . In the course of time , along with the waning of individualism , the sovereignties as sovereignties ceased to exist . This disappearance came about partly through the activities of industry and trade . As mass production grew and communications improved , standardization became a necessity ; material standardization brought in its train political , economic , and moral standardization . So from the Civil War to Prohibition we see a decline of the rights of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not popular but representative . The intention was , however , for a control by the majority . Majorities elected the representatives in Congress and so , also , in the State legislatures , to carry out their will in making laws . The representatives were , however , elected for specified and long periods of time with no provision for replacement short of those periods , whatever their defections from the wish of the majority electing them . The chief executives were also elected with power to appoint the heads of executive departments . The
