Administrative law is the name lawyers have for rulings of Government agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and National Labor Relations Board , to whom " lawmaking " authority is delegated by Congress . With over 100 such agencies functioning today , administrative lawmakers rival judges and legislatures as a nuisance to lawyers . Last week the House of Delegates ( legislative body ) of the American Bar Association , to which 16% of U. S. lawyers subscribe , convened in Chicago 's Edgewater Beach Hotel to discuss two new brands of nuisance insurance . <P> Up for the Delegates ' consideration was a report commissioned over six years ago , finished in 1937 , by a special committee on administrative law headed by Washington 's Colonel O. R. McGuire . The report recommended that each Federal agency : 1 ) publish its detailed rules &; regulations within 90 days after the law it administers goes into effect , and 2 ) set up a special three-man dispute board to review contested decisions before they are taken into court . <P> The implied criticism of the New Deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An ex officio member of the House of Delegates , he advised his colleagues : " Let 's not spend our time tilting against windmills . . . The fact is , the record of administrative tribunals is slightly better than that of the lower courts , where appeals were made . Federal agencies won 64% of their cases , while lower courts were sustained in only 54% of the cases appealed , over a ten-year period . " <P> Unimpressed , the Delegates approved the main provisions of the McGuire report , pledged A. B. A. support to getting them written into law . Going on to consider individual agencies , the Delegates judged the time unripe for comment on the Wages- &-Hours; Administration ( though they applauded its work to date ) , but they recommended three important amendments to NLRA : <P> &gt; To let employers petition for an employes ' election to choose their bargaining representative where no company union is involved ; <P> &gt; To forbid minority strikes and picketing after a majority bargaining agency has been certified ; <P> &gt; To outlaw sit-downs.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
