I N THE Supreme Court of the ' United States , life begins at 5:30 A.si . An army of charwomen , forty strong , scrubs its marble floors . Fifteen laborers begin applying vacuum cleaners and dusteloths to its office furniture and the thick red carpet of the court chamber . The desks and bookcases of the seven justices who never set foot . within their palatial office suites are dusted as carefully as if their owners were to walk in at nine o'clock . Each charwoman is allotted 1000 square feet of floor and must produce a spotless , shimmering surface within three hours . Forty thousand square feet of marble to be scrubbed before 8:30 ! Outside , another crew of laborers is responsible for cleaning the terrace and the long glaring row of steps which lead up to the entrance . Nothing , however , has been devised to protect the virginal whiteness of the fa  --  ade and outer walls from the soft-coal soot belched forth from the chimneys of neighboring apartment houses . After vigorous protests from the Chief Justice , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blobs of smoke dust from other adjacent buildings still cling to the likenesses of Elihu Root , William Howard Taft and Chief Justice Hughes in the carved marble above the court 's impressive entrance . Justice Wakes Early T HE justices of the Supreme Court also are 1 early risers . Justice Brandeis is up and at his work by six every morning . His desk is next to his bedroom in an apartment house high above the city . Justice Cardoso is up at 6:30 or 7:00 , and at work on his opinions . The Chief Justice takes a walk every morning of his life at 7:30 and ie back for breakfast with Mrs. Hughes at 8:00 . Justice Stone rises at 7:00 , breakfasts , then goes for a mile walk in the Seldom is there any intentional disrespect of the court . Only once in recent years has anyone been forcibly ejected  --  a deranged woman who rose during an argument and accused the justices of refusing to hear her divorce case . No photographs can be taken in the chamber while the court is in session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingenious photographers . The most famous of these was a German , who concealed his camera under a black silk sling in which he placed his left arm . With the right arm he lifted the black silk to permit the exposure . Publication of the photographs caused a sensation , plus the State Department 's abrupt termination of the German 's permit to remain in the United States . The maximum capacity of the chamber , including standing room , is 500 , and on decision Mondays this is entirely inadequate . Actually , the chamber is very small in comparison with the rest of the Supreme Court Building , occupying about one-thirtieth of the Boor space of the total building area . There was considerable discussion about this when the building was being planned . It was realized that attendance would be heavy on decision days , but some of the justices argued that attendance would be thin on other days and , if the room were very large , sparse attendance would give an undesirable effect . " Besides , " added Chief Justice Taft , " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Court  --  a Study in Personality EAL clash of opinion and personality comes dur- ing the cross-questioning of attorneys while cases are being argued . This takes place from Tuesdays to Fridays and is done before a thin house . Seated on their raised dais behind the long polished mahogany table which is the supreme bench of the United States , the nine present a picture of diverse and conflicting character . Hughes never forgets his role as Chief Justice . He is the only member who does not lean to one side or bow his head or look weary . The only shift of position which he allows himself is the posture of the left judicial robes . There are no locks . An attendant helps the justices remove their hats , coats , mufflers and rubbers , for they all wear rubbers , even though they go from their homes to their cars to the court scarcely setting foot on the ground . After supping on their robes the justices move into the conference room , where they read the newspapers and chat . Promptly at twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick red-velvet curtain which separates them from the Supreme Court bench and the courtroom . Chief Justice Hughes nods to a page in knee breeches , who pushes a buzzer . The court crier , in response to this signal , cries : " The honorable , the Chief Justice and the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States ! " Simultaneously the justices advance from behind the velvet curtain and stand behind their bench . While they remain standing , the crier continues : " Oyez , oyez , oyez ! All persons having business before the honorable , the Supreme Court are admonished to draw near apd give their attention , for the court is now sitting . God save the United States and this honorable court . " The justices take their seats . The Supreme Court of the United States , most powerful judicial body in the world , is now in session . On Monthly , which is opinion day , the Chief Justice nods first to one , then another of his colleagues , and they read the opinions for which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queue stands outside . Usually , however , Monday 's performance is far less interesting than the hearing of arguments on the days which follow . It is obvious that the justices are at their best as students of the law , not as its oral exponents . Their voices are thin and do not carry . Roberts is the only member of the court whose voice is full and steady . His reading of an opinion is a masterpiece , not only of delivery but of memory . His colleagues , with the exception of Hughes , mumble into their papers , but he looks straight at the crowded courtroom , not once referring to his notes . As the justices read their opinions , two hawk:eyed plain-clothes detectives sit beside the bronze railing which separates the general public from the attorneys , and watch for any conduct unbecoming to the court . No one is permitted to read a newspaper , chew gum , whisper , knit or doze . Usually the attendants are alert to catch these breaches of court order , but , if not , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stopped.hand to the chin , with two fingers extended across the cheek . Cardozo , on the other band , slumps in his chair , his head bent forward , his shock of white hair more to be seen than his face . He is an intent listener , and the quietest of the group , though lie converses frequently with Stone , on his right . Stone , in contrast , is restless and bored , like an outs doors men who can not endure confinement . He lacks the classic features of his neighbors , Cardozo and Sutherland , is pudgy and thickset , like a middle-aged athlete . It is Stone , not Cardozo , who always initiates their conversation , but it is significant that he never turns to his other neighbor , Sutherland , on his right . ( Camelauad on Pars 92 ) No one had ever looked at him so straight . Nor had he ever looked so straight at anyone . " I 'm sorry , " she said ; " really , really sorry . " He knew that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was all different . Sutherland sits perfectly still , save for occasional movements of his hands in his hair and beard . The latter is thin and gray-white , a poor second in impressiveness to that of the Chief Justice . Sutherland 's is a handsome , finely chiseled face , with features for a sculptor , but lacking in vitality . He sits in the same position , giving the impression of complete apathy and detachment from the mundane scene . Butler alone wears old-fashioned metal spectacles . Cardozo and Sutherland wear pince-nez . Stone and McReynolds wear tortoise-shell , the latter putting them on only to read . Brandeis , although eighty years old , does not appear so old as some of his colleagues . His features are sharp and his face narrow . His ascetic life has exempted him from the paunchiness which so often goes with age . Brandeis ' most distinctive feature is his hair , which is gray , not white , and which tfrOWS long , standing out from his head as if he had just had a shampoo , followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small features and black robe , gives him an almost feminine appearance . McReynolds , on the other hand , is strikingly masculine , with heavy jaw and aquiline nose . His favorite pose is tilted back in his swivel chair , his head rolled over to the right , one large and bony hand covering his eyes , for all the world like an old man catching a nap on a park bench . Roberts keeps a glass of water before him most of the time , sips from it . frequently . He snaps his fingers for a page , has the glass filled . There is a drinking fountain just behind the velvet drapes . Roberts and Butler engage in conversation more than any other two , sometimes appear to be joking together . The Seats of the Mighty Occasionally the conversation of his colleagues irri tates Justice McReynolds , who , despite his comatose appearance , indicates by his sudden cross-questioning that he is listening carefully . The nine chairs in which the justices sit were made to order and reflect the character and temperament of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber in the Capitol , the chairs were among the few ac. eouterments transferred . The justices insisted on keeping them . But at the opening session a leg of Justice Roberts ' chair broke , almost throwing him to the floor . After that , Frank Green , marshal of the court , was able to convince the justices that their cherished but decrepit chairs should he abandoned . He called in a junk dealer , who bid only thirty-five dollars for the lot , an offer which so disgusted court officials that they refused to sell , and sent the chairs back to the old Supreme Court chamber . The new chair of Chief Justice Hughes is luxuriously upholstered in He stood up . He wanted her to go before whatever was rising in him broke through . " I know  --  I 'm  --  I 'm sort of grateful that you are . " She waited a moment longer . Then she said , " Goad night , Mr. Fortness , " in a low voice . She turned and went black leather  --  seat , back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spacious foundations of the late Chief Justice Taft . Of similar construction is the chair of Justice Stone , but with supplementary upholstering . Two leather pads are strapped across the back of Stone 's chair  --  one to comfort his neck , one to comfort the base of his spine . Most austere of all is the chair of austere Justice McReynolds . Completely lacking in upholstery , it stands , bare and unalluring , beside the sumptuous chair of his neighbor , the Chief Justice . The seat and back are made of cane , covered with a dark baize material . McReynolds ' chair is distinctive also in being mounted on a swivel , which permits him the interesting distraction of swinging from side to side during a tedious dissertation . Also it allows him to turn the chair and rise from it more easily . McReynolds frequently leaves the court chamber during hearings . Preferences regarding personal comfort extend even to the footstools hidden beneath the bench ; some being square and plain , others double-decked and covered with cloth . Each of the chairs is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of the justice . But that is superfluous , No one could confuse one with another , any more than one could mistake the bald pate of Van Deventer for the flowing mane of Brandeis , or the delicate features of Sutherland for the broad Irish face of Butler . Back of the nine sit four page boys . theoretically hired for their shortness of stature , although two of them have grown fur beyond the short-pants age and look rather ridiculous in the blue knickerbockers , blue coat and black cotton stockings which they are required to wear . Upon the snap of a justice 's finger , a page bobs up beside him , takes an instruction written on a small piece of paper , and disappears . Most requests are for books , and it is amazing with what rapidity a lad will return with the volume the justice desires . Pages receive $110 a month , and work eight months a year . They must be fourteen years old or older and have an education equivalent to the eighth grade . They are appointed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief Justice , and are selected from a long list of applicants , for it seems that almost every other family in the District of Columbia aspires to have its offspring serve in the Supreme Court . Four of the court 's chief officers at present have risen from the ranks of page boys . Frank Key Green , the marshal , was appointed a page by Chief Justice Fuller forty-six years ago . Green is a harassed gentleman who wears the gray striped trousers and stiff collar of formal attire every day the court is in session , and tries to be patient with the flood of visitors who track dust and mud over his spotless floors . out , closing the door after her as though he were asleep and she were afraid of waking him . He stood there , listening to her slow tired steps till they lost themselves overhead and the house was finally at peace . ( TO BE CONTINUED ) Thomas E. Waggaman , the court crier , has been intoning " Oyez , Oyez " for twenty-three years , but despite that fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which are written the lines he must speak in calling the court chamber to order . Although he has bean delivering his lines for nearly a quarter of a century , he wakes up at night sometimes , dreaming that he recited Lincoln 's Gettysburg Address or Little Jack Horner by mistake . Hence the little black book . Charles Elmore Cropley , clerk of the Supreme Court , and Reginald C. a deputy clerk , also came up through the ranks , beginning as page boys . The clerk 's salary of $4200 annually , and that of his aides , is not appropriated by Congress but is collected by the clerk 's office in fees for filing briefs , appearances and appeals . The surplus is returned to the Treasury . The court reporter , Ernest Knaehel , draws a salary of $8000 and is entrusted with editing all decisions , checking citations and references before they are made public . All court employees are hired subject to the approval of the Chief Justice , have no Civil Service status , could be discharged by him at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pass upon any of the staff except the marshal , reporter. , clerk , and captain of the guard . They , in turn , employ their own staff with his approval . No Patronage fivailabIe Taken en masse , the personnel of the Supreme Court constitutes quite a sizable army and would be a luscious patronage plum were it to fall in the lap of Congress . It includes thirty-three- guards , forty charwomen , three head charwomen , twenty junior laborers , seven elevator operators , two check boys , nineteen messengers and doorkeepers , seven librarians , ten law clerks , one laundress , one plumber , one electrician , one air-conditioning engineer , one steamfitter , one elevator mechanic , one engineer in charge , a large stenographic staff , and various other clerks and laborers. 1 When the Supreme Court moved into its new building , Chief Justice Hughes established for the first time a special police force answerable only to the court . They carry revolvers in holsters and are the only police force the capital whose members wear San Browne belts . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being required to check in at pull boxes inside and outside the building . No arrests ever have been made inside the building and , aside from automobile thieves , only three arrests have been made outside . One was when Harvard students hung the flag of Soviet Russia on the flagpole , another waa when an enterprising theatrical press agent used the white marble side of this building as a motion-picture screen , and recently when a ( Continued on Pogo 951 ( Continued from Page 921 young man was arrested for selling copies of the book , The Nine Old Men , on the front steps of the building . Chief duties of the guards are shepherding the vast throng of visitors which flow through the corridors of the Supreme Court every day . When the late Chief Justice Taft laid the blueprints of the court 's proposed new home before his associates , Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes remarked : But will the tourists bother to cross the plaza to look in on the court ? " His worry was unjustified . Never before have so many visitors paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-time high occurred in April , MB , when 74,329 people went through the building . Behind the Scenes With the Court The crowds are well behaved , awed by the grandeur of the building , and the guards are not bothered with the usual depredations of souvenir hunters 0 and people who write their names on walls . Even the washrooms are spared . Chief interest of the tourists centers upon the offices of the individual justices  --  the fact that each fireplace is equipped with a suction fan to carry off the heat , so that it will not interfere with the air conditioning ; the fact that each justice has a shower bath , all of them still unused ; the fact that each office is equipped with woolen blankets to warm the justices , even though the rooms seem overheated . Some of the justices use their offices in which to meet friends after the day 's hearings are over . Justice McReynolds uses his to change his shoes before going on the bench . But save for Sutherland and Roberts , many never go near ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which helped design them , is not discouraged . It points out that when new men are appointed to the court , they will get into the habit of working at the new building rather than in their homes . Promptly at two in the afternoon , at a signal from the Chief Justice , the court recesses for lunch , which is served in the small private dining room on the floor above the courtroom . Hero the chairs are alike ; but in their silver , their china , napkins , saltcellars and food , the strong individuality of the nine again expresses itself . . All of the justices have their food sent from home , with the exception of the two who use their offices , Roberts and Sutherland , who order from the public cafeteria on the ground floor . ? rRobertig and Stone , both of large phy-wtique , are the only members who even halfway approach the definition of lusty trenchermen . The others seem to go through the ceremony of eating almost as if it was a formality they did not relish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings from his home one sandwich , cut up into six pieces , and he eats each piece very slowly , as if occupying himself until his colleagues finish . His friend Cardozo eats three sandwiches of whole-wheat bread , carefully wrapped and also sent from his home . The Chief Justice eats only soup and crackers . Their menus seldom vary . Justice Roberts has a special plate of dry bread . The food is heated in electric ovens just off the dining room and served by IN Negro attendants . Occasionally , when their families or friends join them , the justices desert the common table and eat with the tourists in the cafeteria . This happens more frequently with Butler , Roberts , Cardoso and Sutherland . When the court was in the Capitol Building , Justice McReynolds never ate with his colleagues , but took off his robe and descended to the Senate lunchroom . This attracted considerable attention and led to the report that he was on bad terms with his colleagues . Now he joins the common table . The justices go back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Promptly at that hour the Chief Justice leans forward , nods to the attorney who is then speaking , and announces that hearings for the day are concluded . Only if a case can be wound up in a few more minutes does he permit the session to continue beyond the usual adjournment hour . From early October until late May , the Supreme Court follows a clocklike procedure of two weeks of oral argument , then two weeks of secret deliberation . It is during the latter that opinions are discussed and written . Discussion or conference days are on Saturday , and are held in a paneled conference room near the office of the Chief Justice . There is a long table in the center , nine overstuffed chairs around it , and massive bronze doors , outside of which the guard bars tourists for a distance of thirty feet , to make sure there is no eavesdropping while cases are discussed . Conferences begin at noon and continue until 4:30 ; sometimes , as during the recent consideration of the Washington Minimum Wage Act , until 5:30 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the conference . Indicative of how thoroughly he must be conversant with the court docket is the fact that he presents the facts in each case and the questions of law involved . On minor cases and writs of certiorari usually ? there is no disagreement regarding his presentation of the issues . Although it completely escapes the spotlight of public attention , a great bulk of the Supreme Court 's work is in passing upon writs of certiorari . A writ of certiorari is an order by a higher court to a lower court to send up the record in a ease for review , in order to determine whether the higher court shall take jurisdiction . And although there are seven channels through which ases may reach the Supreme Court , by far the most prolific is that of writs of certiorari . Prior to 1925 , the Supreme'Court had no power to decide which cases it should or should not review , and , as a result , was two and three years behind in its docket . It was Chief Justice Taft who urged reform of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain exceptions specified in the Constitution , controls the court 's jurisdiction ? to grant it discretionary power to determine for itself which cases it considered important enough to review . This enabled Taft , before he died , to clear the docket of ninny long-delayed cases , Since that time , Chief Justice Hughes has developed such a passion for efficiency that sometimes the docket has been cleared even before the periods set for hearing cases have expired . Passing upon this incessant flow of writs of certiorari is the chief drudgery of the justices and , in order to keep abreast of the flow , each must examine an average of between two and three a day . ' rho writs are long , sometimes accompanied by evidence which weighs five to teen pounds , and usually each justice depends upon his secretary to fusaces With Sealed Lips Majority opinions , on the other hand , represent a compromise . Rarely do they represent what the author really believes , but the composite of what he can get his brethren to agree on . Because of the conflicting views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversial ease is a tremendous , sometimes nerve-racking responsibility , and usually is given to a younger member of the court . For many years Justice Sutherland was the man most frequently called upon to mold the majority views for the conservative members in controversial cases , But with the passing of time , his place has been taken by the younger and more vigorous Justice Roberts . The justice who is assigned to writing the opinion may have as much time as lie wishes , although usually he finishes within two or three weeks . During the interim after a MS() has been decided , and before it is announced , every member of the court is on guard to give no hint regarding the nature of the decision . With some justices this applies even to members of the family . Justice Van Devanter 's sons making it a habit never to discuss court matters ( Continued on Page 98 ) " . THE SATURDAY ( ContInued tram Peg . 9S ) with their ' father . Washington society recognizes the impropriety of mentioning court questions to the justices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , the wife of a Federal Reserve governor naively questioned Chief Justice Hughes about . the ; gold-clause case while its derision was pending . He icily ignored her . Justice Cardozo is so careful to avoid any subject even remotely bordering on the court that his social conversation frequently becomes almost inane persiflage . Justice Stone is the only member of the court who is not afraid he will say something indiscreet while eases are pending . Once , when invited to tea by Rep. Maury Maverick , of Texas , Stone was informed by his host that John L. Lewis , of the United Mine Workers , also had been invited . Justice Cardoso , given similar information , asked to he excused , but Stone replied : " I do n't care who 's going to be there . I 'm a free agent and I have a right to come and go as I wish .

Advance information regarding some decisions would he worth millions to stock-market manipulators , but only once in the history of the court has there been a leak . This was followed by the dismissal of the secretary of one justice . A unique formula is followed in order to insure secrecy . No official of the court other than the reporter is allowed to see a decision before it is sent . to the printer . At the print shop , the decision is cut into different sections and handed to different linotype operators , so that none of them see more than small , unrelated sections . These sections are assembled under careful safeguards , proofs are pulled and sent back to the justices who are concurring in that particular decision . They write " I agree " on the margin , or sometimes suggest slight changes in the text . This is rare , however , since the case has been discussed very thoroughly before it is printed .

These copies are so limited , however , that with the announcement of some historic decision , such as the Agricultural Adjustment Art , the Department of Justice was unable to get a copy until it day after the Supreme Court had declared the act . unconstitutional . When not on the bench , the justices of the Supreme Court lead lives as individualistic and different as their chairs , their silverware , or the food they bring to lunch . The two things they seem to have in common are pride in the court and a desire to leave Washington in the slimmer . Justice McReynolds. a bachelor , is the only member who braves the heat of Washington after June , sometimes loafing in his Sixteenth Street apartment until August before he goes oil to Europe or to visit his sister in Tennessee . Of the others , Justice Brandeis is packed up on the last day of court and leaves that day for his summer place on Cape Cod . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haut off the coast of EVENING POST Maine , Justice Roberts leaves for his farm near Valley Forge ; Justice Van Deventer goes to his farm outside of Baltimore ; Justice Butler motors to his summer place at Blue Ridge Summit , Pennsylvania ; Justice Sutherland sails for the country of his birth , England ; while Justice Cardozo goes to Rye , just outside his beloved Manhattan , where he spends the summer reading and visiting with old friends . The Chief Justice makes a more leisurely exit. , motoring to Now Hampshire , and stopping en route wherever his whim dictates . During the winter in Washington , Mr. Hughes is in great demand socially but permits only one night of social relaxation , with the result that those nigh ts  --  Sa I u rdays  --  are hooked up sometimes a year in advance . Occasionally he makes an exception to this rule in order to take Mrs. Hughes to the theater . Both are great theater lovers and are patrons of a summer theater in New Hampshire .

Hughes  --  Mechanic Extraordinary He also has a unique pair of hands and a mechanical skill which few people know about . He can use surveyors ' instruments , repair lighting fixtures , and it is the boast of Senator Ashurst , chairman of the Judiciary Committee , that Hughes once repaired an organ . On one occasion a newspaperman called upon Hughes ' secretary , Wentworth W. Misehler , with a query from his editor as to the exact year the C'hief Justice had begun growing his beard . Mr. Mischler has been Hughes ' secretary for six years , and was secretary to Chief Justice Taft . before that . He replied : " No , sir , you 'll have to excuse me from asking the Chief Justice that question .

When did you start growing your beard ? " The Chief Justice threw back his head , laughed , and without a moment 's hesitation replied : " In 1599 . " Hughes is it prodigious worker , has a photographic mind , can memorize a speech almost as he writes it , and expects those who work with bins to be as fast and as energetic as he . He is considered the slave driver of the court , and has the reputation of wearing out a law clerk every year . His last clerk , Francis R. Kirkham , complained that he was only able to get three and four hours of sleep per night and resigned after a year .

Once , meeting his old law IS/ partner , Senator King , of Utah , he asked : " Do you know Zagloba ? " King was puzzled . " I 've been reading Sienkiewicz , the Polish nbvelist , and his character , Zugloba , is unsurpassed  --  or , if passed at all , only by Shakespeare 's Falstaff . " Sutherland 's only other recreation is story-telling . He has a dry Sallee of humor and an aptitude for Scotch dialect which delights those few friends who now see bine Born in England , and taken to the United States as a boy , Sutherland goes bark to his native Buckinghamshire almost every summer , has now made twenty-six trips to Europe .

They have Veen drawn closer together by two tragedies in their lives  --  the death of their son Philip when he was eighteen , and the blindness of one ( laughter . Another daughter is happily married . On his desk in the Supreme Court Building , Sutherland has a faded brownish photograph of Mrs. Sutherland and their son . This and a glass of water are the only articles on his desk , There are no pictures or trophies on the paneled walls of his office to indicate that he has any other interests . That Sutherland is the most amiable member of the court is testified by the fact that many of the Senate Progressives who disagree with him vehemently pay tribute to his sweetness of dieposilion .

Van Devanter  --  Farmert ustiee Willis Van Deventer , seventy-eight years old this month , is the second oldest member of the court and oldest in point of service . Appointed by President Tart , he has been a justice of the Supreme Court for twenty-seven years . Despite his age he is one of the most active of the nine , as indicated by his recent difference with the Justice Del part meat . over failure to have a properly authenticated duck-shooting license .

Roberts is another member i of the Supreme Court who takes his farming seriously . He has 600 acres some twenty miles northwest of Philadelphia , where he keeps a herd of Guernseys and makes enough on the sale of milk and other produce to pay for the upkeep of the farm . In Washington , during the court session . he lives in an old-fashioned white clapboard house in ancient Georgetown , not far from the residence of James Roosevelt .

Unlike some of his colleagues , Stone is not a bookish individual , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with people . The Stones dine out four or five times a week , entertain at least once every two weeks , and are at home at least once a week to their friends . Stone turns out more than his share of opinions , though he has a hard time writing them . His handwriting is so bad that even he has difficulty reading it , He writes and rewrites his opinions several times before he is satisfied with them . When court is not in session he works straight through the day , taking only twenty minutes off for lunch and quitting at five o'clock , when he goes for a long walk , usually accompanied by Mrs. Stone . " Various are the Tastes of Men " Pierce Butler , seventy-one , is the chief golfer of the Supreme Court . Almost every Sunday morning , when the weather is fair , he plays at the Burning Tree Country Club , favorite golf course of Pat Harrison , Joe Tumulty and a long list of politically minded members . Justice Butler , however , does not mingle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning with Justice Van Decanter or his old friend , Seth Richardson . Butler 's greatest passions in life are the court , his children and his grandchildren . He is a most devoted father and is the constant companion of his daughter Margaret , who is an incurable invalid . He escorts her to mass every Sunday , and insists that she come down to dinner even on formal occasions . At one time Justice Butler was one of the most energetic writers of court opinions . He is less active now , though he still turns out a larger quota than Van Devanter and McReynolds . The pet aversion of James Clark McReynolds is tobacco . He will not tolerate it anywhere near him . Debutantes and cigarette-minded ladies who come to his famous Sunday-morning breakfasts fidget nervously until they can get outside and light up . Once when Justice Roberts , then a newcomer to the bench , lit a cigar during a Saturday conference , McReynolds hastily scribbled a note asking him to put it out . Tobacco , IvIeReynolds explains , makes him physically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bachelor , is the chief recluse of the court .. He has few friends , never goes out except to very intimate parties given by his close associates . Sometimes he goes duck shooting , though usually alone . He . plays golf occasionally , but in this , too , recently , he is alone . Benjamin N. Cardoso , sixty-seven , and the other bachelor of the Supreme Court. , also was a lonesome figure during his first year in Washington , and did not conceal the fact that lie preferred to be hack on the Court of Appeals in New York . Now , however , Cardoso has made new friends , has come to enjoy Washington and , although he likes to poke fun in a gentle way at its pomposity , he also takes great pride and an absorbing interest in the Supreme Court . Cardoso 's best friend is Justice Stone , beside whom he sits on the bench . They are to be seen frequently at Sunday concerts , Cardoso having a special fondness for Wagner , Beethoven and heavier music . Schuhert 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugary . " Cardoso takes absolutely no exercise , even drives from his apartment to that of Justice Stone , only a few blocks away . He takes delight in poking fun at the walking exploits of some of his young friends , particularly Robert Marshall , of the Office of Indian Affairs , whom he once introduced to the daughter of his old law partner , George Englehardt . " Here is a young lady , " he said gleefully , " who once walked thirty miles in one duy , " Although Cardoso has been described as a recluse , as afraid to be seen in the company of women , he has accumulated , in his bashful way , a large circle of friends , most of them young lawyers in the Roosevelt Administration and their wives . One of the latter , Mrs. Walter Gellhorn , actually succeeded in taking the justice to see Of Thee I Sing , in which the Supreme Court played a ludicrous and starred role . The justice also never fails to see Gilbert and Sullivan when it comes to town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a movie . Aside from these few diversions , Cardozo 's chief interest is his work and his reading . He is one of the most prolific writers of opinions , is most painstaking in his study of every case before the court , and also finds time to do a prodigious amount of reading . People send him books from all over the country , and he feels obligated to return their kindness by reading at least part of them . The Mecca of the Intellectuals Cardoso is probably the most mothered member of the court . Ever since the death of his sister , who was very dear to him , his friends have worried about his exercise , his health and his recreation . " We must go up and see Benny , " they remind themselves . " He must not stay in that stuffy old apartment . " And " Benny " pretends not to know that lie has a nickname or that they take so much trouble over him , but is pleased and proud just the same . Louis Dembitz Brandeis , eightyyears old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his colleagues . This probably is because he , like Cardoso , has a multitude of young friends . For years , Brandeis ' Monday afternoon at-homes were the Mecca of Washington 's young intellectuals , while his voluminous mail kept him in contact with others throughout the country . The justice answers all of this mail personally , in his own handwriting . He employs a law clerk , but no secretary to help him with his correspondence . Work begins for the oldest justice at six in the morning , at which time he concentrates on his opinions . He writes all of them longhand , some running to a length of twenty or thirty pages . His study is just off his living suite in one of the oldest apartment houses in the city . Up a narrow stairway from the Brandeis apartment is the musty office of his law clerk . The justice quits working on his opinions at 8:30 in order to breakfast with Mrs. Brandeis . He eats fruit juice , eggs , a piece of crisp toast and a glass of milk . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast Brandeis goes over the newspapers , also is a regular reader
