" Only General Araki can ride the tiger , " was a picturesque excuse passed around among Japanese politicians when they found themselves forced to make him War Minister with the powers of a quasi-Dictator ( TIME , April 4. 1932 ) . " The tiger " was Japan 's Army &:; Navy , then rampant with the ardor of fire-eating younger officers " to wage a purifying struggle war for the Divine Emperor . " Last week , in view of the spectacular success in Japanese eyes of General Araki 's two year ride on the tiger , the entire Far East was profoundly jolted by abrupt news that General Araki had resigned " because of ill health . " <P> When the scraggly-mustached , ascetic General took charge , Japan 's tiger was so restive that petty naval officers assassinated Premier Ki Inukai because they considered him a pacifist ( TIME , May 23 , 1932 ) . Trusting General Araki , the fighting services who despise and hate all Japanese politicians , then settled down to the glorious tiger work of gobbling up Manchukuo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clawing at Shanghai . Probably the Araki " ride " saved Japanese parliamentary government from being destroyed by a coup d ' tat . <P> On last New Year 's Day citizens of Tokyo were dying of influenza at the rate of 90 per day . General Araki caught it . As the epidemic was brought under control he was said to have pneumonia . With Parliament about to reassemble this week Japan 's politicians looked for a chance to reassert themselves as the War Minister lay abed . Japan 's new Foreign Minister , Mr. Koki Hirota , recently her Ambassador to Moscow , hoped for a chance to launch with caution a somewhat more conciliatory policy toward Russia . <P> On his hard wooden pillow General Araki pondered these things and the flame of his fighting loyalty burned high . " I am too weak now , " he said . " Another must take my place . " This other turned out to be a tiger man more militant if possible than invalid Araki-hale &; hearty General Senjuro Hayashi , Inspector General of Military Education . <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " winked a complacent War Office official pointing out that his new chief recently wrote the preface to the novel provocatively describing a war between Japan and Soviet Russia. * But despite his militancy War Minister Hayashi is rated more cosmopolitan than General Araki . Several times he has represented Japan in Geneva , gained a broader world view . On taking office he had nothing to say to correspondents , beyond admitting that the Japanese Who 's Who is correct in listing his recreation as " the collecting of swords . " <P> *Not to be confused with the novel about the war between Japan and the U. S. with a preface by Vice Admiral Suetsugu , Commander of the Japanese Fleet ( TIME , Dec. 25 ) .
