txt The U. S. Maritime Commission agreed informally yesterday to consider the possibilities of assisting coastwise ship operators by giving them consideration in some measure comparable to treatment now accorded shippers in foreign trade . Hearing an appeal for assistance to coastal shippers , not eligible for ship operating subsidies , from Ernest M. Bull , president of the Bull Steamship Co. and spokesman for the Atlantic Coastwise Steamship Ass-Deletion , Chairman Kennedy asked that the coastwise operators ' request be briefed in detail and submitted to the Commission for special study . Mr. Bull asked the Commission 's assistance in securing the following : ' Removal of Federal taxes on replacement funds ; amendment of the tax ruling to reduce to 20 years the legal Melo ! a vessel ; a proclamation freeing coastal shippers from the necessity of securing permission to sell ships . Asks Aid in Labor Dispute . - - ? ? Mr. ' DUI ! also ** ' Crreryll'esion to find a means of settling the 31/esenit ? factional labor disputes which are now disrupting the maritime industry . But , when asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none and Mr. Kennedy agreed that there appeared to be no solution at hand . In asking aid for coastwise shippers , Mr. Bull pointed out that the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 provided that the Maritime Commis- ? sion foster all shipping , whether it be engaged in domestic-or foreign trade . He warned " surely it we set standards of expense for foreign trade , which the government will pay and the coastwise trade can not meet , our domestic commerce is bound to decline . " Cost of Construction ' the cost of ship construction has been enormously increased , he argued . " On funds which would go for replacement without a tax , if we were in foreign trade , we must pay a heavy toll . to the government . The Commission has followed what years of experience and practice have quite properly dictated , namely . that 20 years is the economic life of a vessel . The U. S.

That we are obliged to repair and rebuild old units because of higher building costs and the competition of government-built vessels which for the last few years have been a serious factor in lowerinerates , means nothing to the tax collecting unit of our Government , " he told the Commission . In discussing minimum wages and manning scales , Mr. Bull generally was in accord with the arguments advanced by Ira A. Campbell , counsel for the American Steamship Owners Association . Mr. Campbell asserted " our association regards the action which the commission may take in fixing minimums as affected with a higher public interest than lies simply in the volume of subsidy expenditures. because domestic coastwise shipping is so intimately connected with foreign shipping in the minimum wage and manning scales and working conditions prescribed in the contracts for ships engaged in foreign service will also become the minimums for vessels employed in the domestic service . " Mr. Campbell suggested that an acceptable minimum to the operators would be the lowest wage scale negotiated by collective bargaining with labor unions  --  the February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. International Seaman 's Union . Earlier William Green , A.

" Mr. Green solicited support of Chairman Kennedy and the Maritime Commission in the fight against the new CIO National Maritime Union . Calls Commission Responsible The A. F. of L. head declared that the Maritime Commission is responsible for the development of " destructive factionalism " in the maritime labor situation " because the Commission has assumed a neutral attitude and has refused to recognize that there is a vital and easily distinguishable difference between factions . " He indicated that the International Seamen 's Union has honored its agreements and opposed strikes while maintaining that the NMU has " no regard for solemn agreements , " and " advocates and practices strikes .
