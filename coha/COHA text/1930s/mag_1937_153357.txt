One morning last week Gordon Morrow , 19 , was hunting rabbits on a snow covered trail of cut-over land 50 miles north of Tacoma . Following rabbit tracks he cut through an alder thicket , stumbled over something . It was the naked body of a small boy , with head bashed in , lying stiff and frozen in the snow . Hunter Morrow rushed home , told his father . The local sheriff and his deputies came , examined the body lying 200 feet from a highway , studied fresh tire tracks and footprints , decided the child had been murdered elsewhere and been dumped there the night before . In a few hours Federal Agents arrived and the body was definitely identified as that of Charles Mattson , the 10-year-old whom a bearded , gun-waving kidnapper seized in the living room of the Mattson home in Tacoma two days after Christmas ( TIME , Jan. 11 ) . <P> Said the boy 's father , Dr. William W. Mattson , when the news was brought to him : " I feared it . I feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like this would happen . "
