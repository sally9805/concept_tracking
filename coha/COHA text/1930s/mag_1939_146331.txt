Conspicuously absent from all last week 's super-functions in Washington was the fine , bearded figure of the U. S. Chief Justice . Stricken with a duodenal ulcer , Charles Evans Hughes , 77 , lay in his bed at home , so sick that his friends regretfully concluded he would never again take his place upon the Supreme Bench . <P> Flu forced Mr. Hughes to stay away from the Court from March 6 to April 17 , but when he returned everyone commented on what an amazing comeback he had made . His step was firm and vigorous , his color high , eye bright , voice strong . Then he began to fail . His last appearance was on the Wednesday preceding the term 's end , and observers expressed doubt then that he would be able to finish out . <P> Mr. Hughes is the second man in history to have been both Justice and Chief Justice . The first was Edward Douglass White , whose colleagues in 1910 unanimously petitioned President Taft for his elevation to lead them . Mr. Hughes resigned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back as Chief in 1930 by President Hoover 's appointment . Washington insiders last week predicted that , if Franklin Roosevelt must pick a new Chief Justice and follows precedent by picking from the field , his choice will lie between Frank Murphy and Robert Houghwout Jackson . If he promotes a Court member , they said , the lucky man will be either Felix Frankfurter or the Court 's baby , William Orville Douglas , 40.
