MEN IN BATTLE-Alvah Bessie-Scrib-er ( $2.50 ) . <P> The finest book that came out of the Spanish War was Andre Malraux 's Man 's Hope ( TIME , Nov. 7 ) . Alvah Bessie 's book is not only the second finest ; it is an addendum . Malraux 's fictional account of the war ended with the Loyalist victory at Brihuega in March 1937 . Bessie 's personal story of eight months in the Lincoln Battalion begins in February 1938 , six weeks before the battalion was cut to pieces in the Fascist drive to the sea . The author , a gifted short story writer and ex-Guggenheim fellow , took part in that retreat and later in the last desperate offensive across the Ebro River . <P> To get into Spain , Bessie and his fellow volunteers had to climb over the Pyrenees one windy , cold night with small paper parcels as their only baggage . At dawn they stood exhausted on a peak , their city overcoats whipping their legs , and looked south for 50 miles over peaceful country . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When we passed we saw that they were poor peasants ; one young , one middleaged , one old . They smiled and said , ' Salud ! Salud Compaeros ! ' The oldest said nothing . " <P> By countless such uninsistent details , Bessie 's writing has the effect of telling exactly how it was . How it was for the Americans , with Times Square still in their heads , singing " There 's a long , long trail awinding " at night in dimly blue-lit trains , learning infantry drill and Spanish , shaking down into an argumentative army in which every officer was " comrade . " They had their own language : a man " organized himself " a new rifle , a chocolate bar , a butt ; the lethal cigarillos finos they were issued were known as " anti-tanks . " <P> Bessie got his first shock on joining the Lincoln Battalion after its retreat from Teruel . Of 500 men who had started the battle there were about 100 filthy , unarmed survivors , silent or snarling , lying dead-beat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an issue of old Russian Imperial Army rifles , they had to slog back into the line , still dopey with fatigue . " You fired till the rifle got too hot to handle ; then you opened the bolt and blew down the barrel and let it cool , resting your face on your extended arm , waiting . You got so you were afraid to lift your head again to fire . . . . And then you suddenly awoke to the fact that you had been asleep in the line itself . . . . " <P> Cut off and retreating again at night , Bessie found himself running in the dark through a camp of Franco 's troops . He was one of four , out of a detachment of 70 , that got across the Ebro into relative safety . After that the men knew that the People 's Army was being overpowered by German and Italian force , that they were the tail-end of the International volunteers . Scared Spanish boys came in as replacements , together with deserters and " goldbricks " once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They killed all the good guys , " he said . " I seen guys die had more room between the eyes than the new men got across the shoulders . "
