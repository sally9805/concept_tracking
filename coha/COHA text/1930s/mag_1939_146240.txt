It is sometimes said that the U. S. coal industry , disposed as it is to overproduce , needs a good strike about every three years . For the nation as a whole this is certainly no formula for wealth and plenty . The six-week soft-coal deadlock that ended last week caused serious and conspicuous economic damage . Retail trade in the strike area dropped 15% to 20% . Estimates of the total loss of purchasing power ran as high as $100,000,000 . Though last week 's settlement came in time to prevent large-scale stoppage of factories , ships or railroads , the effects of the strike will continue to be evident in chart and index for weeks to come . <P> For the bituminous operators , however , the strike was by no means an unmixed evil . On April 1 total bituminous coal stocks had piled up to 40,550,000 tons-nearly a six-week supply at the average rate of U. S. consumption ( 1,000,000 tons per day ) . Not all this accumulated coal was shoveled away during the strike . <P> Some coal users shifted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 49% , despite a price rise of 15 per ton . But the 40,000,000-ton pile of bituminous was burned down to some 20 to 25,000,000 tons , leaving coal 's statistical slate clean .
