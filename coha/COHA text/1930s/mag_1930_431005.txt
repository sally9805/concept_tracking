 | THE NEMESIS OF AMERICAN BUSINESS Y STUART CHASE I RETURNED from Mexico the first week in April . The taxi from the Pennsylvania Station landed us , about seven o'clock in the morning , in front of an apartment house in the east thirties in New York . We rubbed our eyes . How were we to get into the apartment ? For the whole length of the block a solid phalanx of men , six abreast , filled the sidewalk from house wall to gutter . Like a great python , the line curved around the corner of Madison Avenue and , like an act of creation under the microscope of a biologist , cells of humanity from every direction were coagulating into its tail as it twisted and swelled towards Fifth Avenue . A policeman , gently enough , tore a breach through the line and , with suit cases bulging with the serapes of Taxco and the pottery of Puebla , we made our astonished way between the files of stolid , battered men , and up the stairs . We had come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun . But among the Aztec villages we found no unemployment and no visible economic suffering , while here on the sidewalk of the Queen City of the Republic , where , it is alleged , thirty mechanical slaves are equipped to serve the needs of every man , woman , and child , were fifteen hundred men without work and without food . For hours they will stand here ( one has just swayed and collapsed ) until to a thousand of them are given tickets , entitling the holder to tramp some miles to the south , and there hours later receive twenty cents ' worth of food . We have the mechanical slaves truly enough , and this bread line is part of the price that we pay for them . A bitter paradox . To hold , as some do , that any worthy man can secure a job if he only applies himself diligently enough is to be guilty of ' a total , and almost criminal , misconception of the course of the industrial revolution . Let me sketch for you if I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central plateau of Mexico I found an almost pure pre-machine culture . Nor was it by any means a neolithic one . Behind it lay the tradition of a very great and noble civilization ? that of the Aztecs and the  | Toltecs who reared their incredible white cities and stupendous pyramids and temples a thousand years ago . Much of that culture remains intact in the Indian of to-day , bent but not broken by the marchings of Spanish conquerors and of revolutionary armies . A group of these villages will comprise an almost completely self-sustaining unit . Houses are built of local materials , clothing is largely home grown and spun , food comes from the neighboring fields and groves , recreation is a local product in which all participate , while over the whole economic process broods a spirit of authentic craftsmanship giving rise to some of the loveliest pottery , glasswork , masonry , weaving which the world knows . Nobody has much ; a bad harvest may cause real suffering ; you and I would be profoundly uncomfortable adjusting our **32;831;TOOLONG complexes to actual living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go around , in the basic biological sense of the term , leisure to enjoy life , economic independence within the exigencies of climate and food supply , while unemployment is as rare as a Freudian neurosis . Indeed , unemployment is a meaningless term in a self-sustaining pre-machine community . In the fields , in the forests , about the house there is always work to be done . Now let us perform a drastic ? and mindful of these kindly Indians ? a somewhat ghastly , surgical operation . Let us graft upon this community the technic which James Watt set in motion when he solved the problem of the steam engine a century and a half ago . Invested capital comes sweeping into the country and , with it , interest , profits , and wages . Corporations spring like mushrooms . A lumber company takes over the forest and fuel supply . Contractors undertake the building of houses . Mining concerns exploit the silver , copper , and gold of the surrounding mountains . Factories proceed to the manufacture of textiles , agricultural implements , boots and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banks open their Doric doorways . High-pressure men make the round of the cabins , their portfolios bulging with installment contracts . Radios blare , motor horns grunt , saxophones croon , while down from the mountains two hundred miles away loops the slender wire ? which one stroke of a machete might sever ? which pumps the life blood of power and light . Selfsufficiency lies in ruins ; the region is clamped into world machine economy , drawing its supplies of physical goods from the five continents , and supplies of credit from New York and London . The Indians will have a higher standard of living : more things ? and a perplexing amount of new kinds of trouble . They cease to direct their own economic destinies and go to work for a boss . Money wages supplant their sometime more direct means of subsistence . From diversification they turn to specialization ; from cottage craftsmanship to work on the assembly line , or in the machine shop . To eat they must punch a time clock and buy at the Arctic and Antarctic store . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed upon the grave . And unless the transformation here described is directed by a co-ordinating intelligence hitherto unknown , morning after bitter morning they will awake to find themselves without a job . And for a great variety of reasons . A badly managed silver mine fails , disgorging a thousand workers . Large profits have been made by a concern manufacturing serapes ; almost immediately a dozen new mills have invaded the field , competition for weavers has been brisk , wages are good . Then suddenly the serape market is saturated ; prices drop , the old mill and half the new ones shut their doors . Another thousand on the street . A panic seizes the stock market in New York , followed by a business depression . American buyers are marking time , imports decline ; presently Mexican glass and pot-  | tery factories must put their forces on two days a week . The world price of copper takes a slump . Three mines up on the hills give notice to all but the pump men . A new loom room is set up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as thirty did on the old machines . The twenty-six punch their clocks and march out . Five banks merge , and hundreds of clerks together with a number of high executives find their services no longer needed . An efficiency man is teaching women to fold clothes with ten motions rather than thirty , and the market will not absorb the two hundred per cent increase in output . Half the force is laid off . Meanwhile the systole and diastole of the seasons ? the wet and the dry ? fill and empty the fields and the canneries which surround them . Good times come and good times go ; men and women are broken in mind and body by the waiting , the uncertainty , the sheer physical deprivation , and join the ranks of the down-and-outers , the unemployables . No longer the rains , the soils , the personal effort on one 's environment are the arbiters of the community destiny , but the job . For the reasons spread upon the record ? and for a hundred others ? the job is untrustworthy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better off if they submitted to the surgical operation here formulated lies quite outside the discussion . Perhaps they would and perhaps they would not . I should guess the latter , but your guess is as good as mine . The only point I wish to make is that , granting a mechanized environment , normally administered , they could not escape unemployment . Where none are unemployed in the pre-machine environment of to-day , it is safe to assume that after the operation , at least one man out of ten would always be unemployed ; and in the troughs of the business cycle the ratio might run as high as two or three out of ten . Under the hit-and-miss methods of free competition and the unlimited pursuit of profit the process implacably takes its toll . Not only does the worker suffer but , by virtue of a ten to thirty per cent decrease in the community 's purchasing power , the profit suffers too . Unemployment is the nemesis of modern industry . II With the rise of the industrial revolution and the incalculability of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomena in all nations addicted to the machine : 1 . Seasonal unemployment ? as experienced by canning factory workers in the winter . 2 . Technological unemployment ? as experienced by stokers in a liner when one or two white-garbed oil tenders displace them . S. Cyclical unemployment as experienced by some two million persons in the United States this winter following the stock market crash . The last great cyclical depression was in 19 ' 21. 4 . Residual unemployment . The creation through the above misfortunes of a permanent class of unemployables incapable of any disciplined effort . In recent years , particularly in America , two further subdivisions of technological unemployment have been in evidence : 5 . Stop - watch unemployment ? as when , through time-study methods , one bricklayer takes the place of two . 6 . Consolidation unemployment ? as when , by virtue of a merger , half a dozen vice presidents and a hundred times as many clerks and salesmen find their function as overhead charges irrelevant , incompetent , and immaterial . The bread line which coiled about my apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes of unemployment were functioning at their best ? or worst ; that a real business depression had gripped the country ; and that the cheerio paragraphs with a Washington date line which I  | had read in the Mexican papers , were , like the workers caught in a merger , irrelevant , incompetent , and immaterial . It would appear that the administration and the industrial captains had sought by wish fulfillment and holding the right thought to prove the nonexistence of an unpleasant fact . Their efforts were productive of enormous publicity , but something was obviously the matter with the effectiveness of the mental concentration . Here was this bread line . Turning to the back pages of the newspapers , where the optimistic rhetoric gave way to tangible figures , were a number of other unpleasant facts . Let us glance at them . The United States Department of Labor has for years calculated an index of factory employment , using the year 1926 as 100 . What does the index show since the stock market crash ? September 1929 99.3 October 1929 98.3 November 1929 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 1930 89.8 Down , down , down . For every hundred men working in factories in September only ninety were working in March ; ten were on the street . Now compare these figures with some earlier ones . The index figure for March 1929 was 98.6 ; for March 1923 ? also a very busy spring ? it was 110.8 . The drop between these two prosperous periods of 1923 and 1929 ? from 110.8 to 98.6 ? illustrates beautifully , and tragically , the inroads of technological unemployment in six years ' time . With eleven per cent fewer men , factories were producing more goods in 1929 . But the drop from March 1929 to March 1930 was due almost entirely to cyclical unemployment , which in a few months took almost as much toll as six years ' growth in technological unemployment . The latter is in the long run the more serious , but the former is the more dramatic . I had read of " corners being turned " week by week in January , in February , in the early spring , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibit of all . The American Federation of Labor gives us the percentage of unemployment among its membership month by month . This is primarily an accounting for skilled men . The unskilled do not often join trade unions , while experience has repeatedly shown that the unskilled are more subject to unemployment than the skilled . The percentage of unemployed union members runs : March 1929 14% September 10 October 11 November 12 December 16 January 1930 20 February 22 March 21 Up , up , up ? even as the employment indices went down , down , down . These figures show two appalling things . First , that even in the best of times one skilled man in ten is without a job . Second , that the number of unemployed more than doubled from September to March . The back-page reports come soberly in . . . . Chambers of Commerce in 200 New York State communities in March show ratios of unemployment ranging from 5 to 70 per cent . . . . The National Urban League reports 330,000 negroes unemployed . . . . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against 28,000 in the peak of 1929 . . . One-third of the hosiery workers of Philadelphia are out of work . .. . Fourteen woolen mills shut down in the Albany district , discharging 1,600 , and putting 600 on part time . . . . 150,000 automobile workers jobless in Detroit , the total employed falling from 450,000 to 300,000 , with many of the latter on part time . . . . A special study in Buffalo , based on personal interviews and reported by the Monthly Labor Review , shows 11 per cent completely idle , and 18 per cent either idle or on part time . . . . A 40 per cent reduction  | in automobile workers is reported by the Monthly Labor Review from April to December 1929 . . . . The National Cash Register Company has 6,500 on its payroll on March 7 , 1930 , as against 8,000 " a few weeks ago . " . . . Residential construction shows an alarming shrinkage . . . . The Whitin Machine Works in Massachusetts normally carries a force of 3,500 men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . And I have hardly made a dent in the clippings and reports before me . What the grand total of unemployed for the nation was in the early spring of 1930 no man knows . Months from now the computing machines of the Census Bureau may give us a reliable indication . Various estimates have been made , however . Senator Brookhart believes the figure lies between 3,000,000 and 6,000,000 . He is probably right . Mr. Darwin J. Meserole of the National Unemployment League hazards 6,600,000 ? which is undoubtedly high . The crash of 1921 probably did not account for more than 5,000,000 , and the present slump is , as yet , no worse than 1921 ; possibly not quite so severe . William Green of the American Federation of Labor estimated 3,700,000 in February . Senator Couzens reports that a high government official told him that within a few weeks after the stock market debacle unemployment jumped from 700,000 to 3,100,000 . . . . Take your choice . My guess would be at least 4,000,000 in March . The figures cited earlier indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the best of times , seven per cent of the 30,000,000 " gainfully employed " are idle ? a very conservative figure ? this gives us some 2,000,000 in the army of the chronically jobless ? the number seeking work in a " good " month like September 1929 . Double this , and we reach 4,000,000 for a sinister month like March 1930 . This is a reasonably crude guess , but leaning , I think , to the conservative side . The reasons for the bread line around my house are rapidly coming into focus . In a sense it is a bread line four million strong , that , in single file , three feet apart , would reach from New York to Denver , with 300 miles to spare . For a bread line there must be bread , and somebody to provide it . Public and private charities say last winter was the worst since 1921 , if not since 1914 . My particular bread line , organized by The Little Church Around the Corner , had made no such effort since the panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 150 of whom were genuine downand-outers ; " the great majority were honest men who would work if they could . " Every trade was represented , including musicians and engineers . There were other bread lines in New York , and three in Brooklyn . The 611 rooms of the Salvation Army 's flop house on the Bowery were filled every night , with sometimes as many as 400 men sleeping on the floor . " Things are worse than they have been for a good many years . One fact is very noticeable ? the majority of homeless and jobless are nativeborn Americans . " The Russell Sage Foundation , tabulating relief budgets in 77 cities , finds : " Acute demands for outdoor relief , which , beginning in October , have severely taxed the resources of public and private agencies , were unabated in February . During the month $4,676,000 was distributed to 164,000 families . " The Charity Organization Society of New York reports more applications for aid from destitute families than at any time since 1921 ? 100 per cent greater than in 1929 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributed as many as 12,000 meal tickets in one day . Five per cent of these applicants held college degrees , and a few were Phi Beta Kappa men . They were largely American born , and their average age was 30 . The Welfare Council of New York had to charter an old barge in the East River as an overflow flop house . Twenty-five hundred men were fed daily in Pittsburgh bread lines . The Family Welfare Association  | of America , tabulating reports from 60 cities , finds a 100 per cent increase in relief administered in January 1930 over January 1929 , and a 200 per cent increase in families in distress due to lack of work . Hospital beds are also an index of unemployment . Bellevue notes an increase of 12 per cent . " Many of these patients are from lodging houses . Out of work and destitute , their resistance has become lowered and has induced an acute condition in what are ordinarily chronic complaints that do not require hospitalization . " It has been a bitter winter on the Bowery and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread lines has glared a signboard : " Business is good ? Keep it good . " III As men lose their wages their purchasing power declines . The bulk of purchasing power in the United States consists of wages . This reduces sales in other industries until they too begin to reduce their working force . The vicious spiral begins to whirl . The Annalist 's index of factory payrolls fell from 109 in September 1929 to 95.6 in January 1930 ? the lowest since December 1924 . According to the Annalist , wages have fallen even faster than employment ? indicating a certain lack of sympathy with Mr. Hoover 's recommendation that wage levels be sustained . A further lack of sympathy is reported from Dayton . Personnel managers were interviewed in respect to their handling of lay-offs . Said one , " All they got was ten minutes ' notice . That 's not fair , but that 's all I got from the New York office . " The tabulations of the Labor Bureau , Inc. , show a heavy increase in wage cuts in recent months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply far in excess of demand . Incidentally , demand is considerably below normal . Mr. William Green , testifying before the Senate , estimates a loss of purchasing power in the domestic market of one billion dollars in the first three months of 1930 . In the same hearings Senator Wagner introduced figures to show payroll shrinkages of $200,000,000 a month in factory employment alone . The repercussion is well documented by a drop of $86,000,000 in outlays for building materials in January 1930 as compared with 1929 . This seems to show a certain lack of sympathy with the great construction program which was to guarantee prosperity . IV So much for the tangible evidence as to the economic state of the nation in the spring of 1930 . If you want more , I am in a position to supply a carload of documents , more or less . The figures prove that prosperity can not be sold like a tooth paste : by making people want it . And they prove conclusively , I think , that the fifth great era of American commercial prosperity , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ( rather below the average span ) and died on a certain sixteen-million-share day in October , 1929 . Many of us at the time saw no logical reason why a stock-market collapse should necessarily undermine business , and indeed there is none ; but what most of us did not see was the extent of the black cloud over Detroit which had been gathering all summer . Along about July the nation found itself unable to purchase motor cars as fast as they were being built . Demand began to slacken , and in due time production had to follow suit . The automotive industry was the backbone of the whole prosperity era , and as , faster and faster , it began to slip , it dragged the whole business structure down with it . Thus undoubtedly a depression was in order , though without any stock-market collapse the curve would not have dipped so deep . It is alleged that factories are now equipped to produce more than 7,000,000 motor cars a year . With safety valves tied down , and selling pressure at the bursting point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in 1930 , it is safe to say , sales will be far below that figure . Senator Couzens tells us that radio factories can turn out 15,000,000 units a year , while only 3,000,000 can be marketed . In industry after industry potential output is vastly greater than demand ? a condition which grows steadily worse . Sometimes I wonder if the whole mass production , low-unit cost , high-pressure selling formula has not gone almost as far as it can under the present limits of income distribution , and is not destined , if not to collapse , at least to be profoundly modified . The automobile was the keystone of the arch , and the stone has slipped . Nor is there any article on the horizon to take its mighty place . A fool-proof airplane might do it , but where is the fool-proof airplane ? V Americans want things ? lots of them . The raw material is available ? as yet ? to provide them , together with a willing labor force , a beautiful technic of management , and an abundance of capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the motor car , business will go on . It may stagger for a time , but it is inconceivable that it is permanently crippled . The current depression will pass , and the emergency bread lines fade away . Cyclical unemployment will mark time until the next depression . What threatens to continue unabated , in good times and bad , is technological unemployment with its three faces ? the machine , the merger , the stop watch . In four years oil refineries increased output 84 per cent , and laid off .5 per cent of their men while doing it . Tobacco manufacturing output climbed 53 per cent in the same period , with 13 per cent fewer men at the end . This is the trend throughout industry . It can mean only one thing . An equivalent tonnage of goods can be produced by a declining number of workers , and men must lose their jobs by the thousands ? presently by the millions . Heretofore , after a dreary period of searching , they have found other jobs . But how near to saturation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot-dog stands , spear carrying in Hollywood , and the other " blotting paper " trades ? How near are we to a genuine attack on the staggering wastes of distribution , with its inevitable result of a reduction in man power ? Nobody absolutely knows , but many are guessing ? your author included ? that the blotting paper is becoming soggy . The automobile industry alone soaked up 4,000,000 new jobs since 1900 , but its curve of employment is now definitely downward . Says the Iron Age : " If the productivity of industry through mechanization continues to increase in the next 25 years in the same way and at the same rate as during the last 25 , only 45 men will be needed for the work which to-day requires 70 , and that formerly required 100 . In the automobile industry 30 workers were doing in 1925 as much work as 100 workers in 1914 . " What are we going to do with the 25 men out of 70 that are to be displaced in the next 25 years ? And there may be far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an accelerating one . Dr. Wesley C. Mitchell estimates that no less than 650,000 men were added to the ranks of the reserve army of the unemployed from 1920 to 1927 . We remember too the drop in the index numbers of employment from March 1923 to March 1929 , already quoted . Here is a new ensilage harvesting machine that cuts cornstalks in the field and delivers them to the silo without a human hand touching a single stalk . Here is a new tabulating machine capable of doing the work of 100 skilled actuaries . Here is an automatic mechanism producing 73,000 electric light bulbs every 24 hours , displacing 2,000 hand operators for each machine installed . Here is Section E of the St. Louis concrete sewer project . Thirtythree machine operators , aided by 37  | laborers , are doing the work of 7,000 pick and shovel men . Seventy men and machines displace 7,000 ! The United States Department of Commerce estimates that combines in the harvesting of wheat in one area have cut the force of farm laborers from 50,000 to 20,000 . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron chink " which has revolutionized the canning of fish , automatic stokers , mechanical glass blowers , automatic power stations , automatic knitting machines , bookkeeping machines , paint sprayers , mechanical cotton pickers , the telephonic typewriter , automatic check writers ? and a hundred more , all taking their toll of direct labor . It must not be forgotten that , in the final balance , the direct labor which is displaced may find a job in building or servicing the machine ? but the margin of jobs permanently lost is reasonably wide , otherwise there would be no point in introducing the mechanism . Turning to the allies of the iron bouncer , we note a recent statement in Forbes Magazine : " Never before were so many salaried men looking for positions . Men formerly receiving $10,000 to $30,000 are now anxious to start at half salary . Thus many bargains in human material are available . " Under every merger we shall find a bargain basement . And here are the indefatigable time study men . Stop watch in hand , they eliminate enough unnecessary movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 88 per cent . Moving on to the next shop , they cut the time of assembling carburetors from 450 minutes to 45 . Few markets can absorb such staggering increases in output per man . So the unabsorbed fraction must punch the clock for the last time . In swinging a pick in the coal mines , in sorting potatoes , in picking fruit , in scores of occupations , the time-study brigade is eliminating motions , and with them men . Not only in motions , but in shop arrangement , routing , lighting , ventilating , management generally , is the process rampant . Better conditions ? true ; fewer men ? almost always . If a machine does not get you , a stop watch will ; and if you dodge both there is a merger waiting around the corner ? such must be the thought which lies none too lightly in millions of American minds to-day . If you are alert enough to keep ahead of all three , God knows when you may trip and plunge into the crevasse of a cyclical depression ? like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have just recorded . VI This is no way for a civilized society to behave . Unabated , it will bring most of us to wish that the industrial revolution had never been born . For all our bath tubs , washing machines , and canned asparagus , we may grow more and more envious of the Aztec , who if he has not so many dandy little jiggers , has at least a steady and rewarding job . And quite possibly some of us may start to smash things up . Such a dependable gentleman as Mr. William Green told the Senate that he had no hopes of keeping his hitherto orderly cohorts in line if the conditions which created unemployment were allowed to follow a masterless drift . If we care enough about it , we can very greatly diminish , if not altogether liquidate unemployment . It will cost something ? but consider what it now costs us in charity , in taxes which flow from public charity , in high labor turnover , in broken shop morale , in the quality of work done by men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on closed and partly closed factories and , above all , in reduced markets due to loss of purchasing power . I wonder if the total cost of seizing the situation by the throat would equal the total losses now engendered ? I am speaking in strict financial terms for the moment , waiving the whole human cost in suffering , hopelessness , and degradation . Conceivably , we might start with  | an intelligent and honest publicity campaign to replace the winter 's dishonorable record of prosperity billboards in the Bowery ? a campaign which flatly recognizes facts , however harsh , and tries to swing public opinion towards constructive remedies . We have the precedent in the Safety First and the Cancer Control drives . We might even go so far as to hope that some of the advertising fraternity might give a moment or two from their sterner duties and originate some effective slogans : Six Hours ' Work and Work for Everybody . Give a Job and Get a Customer . A Steady Job . Ivory Soap Gives It ? Why Not Your Boss ? If Mexicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the ravings of a rank amateur . I appeal to those who know the technic to improve them . ) We need to mobilize public opinion as in the Liberty Bond drives ? with posters , page spreads , four-minute speakers , radio talks , news reels , editorials , the whole colorful phenomenon which we Americans do so well , and which is our equivalent of the poor Mexican 's fiesta . In such an atmosphere concrete measures might have a chance of success . They may be launched on many fronts . The logical , sensible , and only final answer to technological unemployment is to shorten working hours . Under present practice , as the machine advances , fewer men work equally long ( or approximately so ) . Why not keep the entire force on the payroll but work them less ? Thus the whole nation would share in technological advances : the worker in a steady job with fewer hours , the owner in steadier markets and profits , due to undiminished purchasing power . This is the final goal . I do not deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more brains and more co-ordinated planning than have ever as yet blessed the Republic . It would be something , however , to get it into the national consciousness . The regularization of industry lies somewhat short of the final goal , but concrete beginnings have already been made . The Procter and Gamble Company , for instance , estimates its annual production in advance ( the variation does not exceed 3 per cent ) , divides the total by 48 , plans to produce that much soap in every week of the year , and guarantees 48 weeks ' steady employment to every man who has been in the factory for a term of at least 6 months . Regularization may be approached through four channels : the Business Survey Conference of Mr. Hoover , the trade associations , the industrial manufacturer or contractor , the labor union . For some concerns where seasonal and storage problems have not been solved the program is impossible . For others it may have only partial application . But for thousands it could be put into tangible effect if only their managers could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force to demand it . Regularization can be only an intermediate goal , because while it provides steady work for those employed , it takes no cognizance of those displaced by machines , time studies , or mergers . It helps the ins enormously , but the outs not at all . What it does in effect is to kill seasonal unemployment and perhaps cripple cyclical ; technological it leaves untouched . Third , there are the long-swing construction programs , optimistically and exhaustively discussed these past few months . In respect to them we need more action and less talk . A construction engineer told me recently that business in his field for the first three months of 1930 had been the worst in his fifteen years ' experience . I inquired about the front-page stories , and the figures with the quantities of zeros . " Bosh , " he said , " it was stuff they were going to build anyway , except that a lot of it they did n't build ! " Carefully prepared , with something of the intelligence with which an army conserves its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursed in the good years and brought  | forward when a cyclical depression threatened . It was not so done this winter ? but the job was new and the time was short . It could be done , and Senator Wagner has a bill before Congress to expedite it . Beyond the immediate construction programs , consider the vast amount of useful and necessary labor required in a sound national afforestation project , in slum clearance , in regional planning and beautification work . Some day we must tackle such projects . Why not now ? Fourth , we must have better statistics on unemployment , preferably collected through a nation-wide system of public labor exchanges . No engineer can build a dam until he knows how much dirt he has to move . Meanwhile the exchanges themselves would be enormously valuable in protecting displaced workers from the villainous brigandage of most private exchanges and in informing applicants honorably and specifically of where jobs are to be obtained , if any . This would mitigate the practice of telling a hundred men in Chicago that there is a job in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single position or a purely fictitious one available when the whole hundred spend their last nickel in reaching Milwaukee . Fifth , we can raise the age limit at which children are permitted to enter industry , thus salvaging jobs for their elders . If the minimum were placed at 16 years rather than the prevailing 14 years ( in most states ) some hundreds of thousands of jobs would be conserved . The benefit to the children themselves is too obvious to need argument . At the same time studies should be undertaken to find out the type of job that the older worker is especially qualified to fill , and thus halt the vicious and stupid practice of firing , or refusing to hire , men or women because they are 35 or 40 or 45 years old . As industry becomes increasingly automatic , the steadiness and dependability of the older worker should be increasingly valuable . Flighty youngsters may have more muscle , but the automatic function needs no muscle ; it needs careful inspection , dial watching , checking , and repairing . I am convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the modern world which the older worker is better fitted to perform than the man under 40 . The above programs , if put into energetic effect , will go far towards liquidating unemployment , but a certain amount of lost time there is bound to be , even under the best of conditions . The industrial machine is not frictionless and never can be . For those who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own , particularly during the transition period , two systems of aid are in order ? the dismissal wage and unemployment compensation . The former is a lump sum paid by the company to an employee when forced to give his position to a machine ( or for other causes ) , preferably on a sliding scale based on length of service . The latter is such a system as that set up by the Dennison Manufacturing Company or the Amalgamated Clothing Workers , where reserves are accumulated from profits and payrolls to meet the just debts of industry when the machine or hard times come . State unemployment insurance is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be applied if management and labor are themselves unable to provide the necessary funds .
