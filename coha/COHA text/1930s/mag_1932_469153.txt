I CAN see him now , striding across the campus , hatless , his blond hair immaculately parted in the middle , one notebook carelessly carried under his arm . And always that cheery smile on his face as he recognized you : " Hullo there . " . . . Even in college it was not hard to foresee that Rollin Thorndyke was bound to be a success in life . For , unlike the majority , he knew what he wanted and went directly for it . He seldom seemed to work , always had time for any extramural activity , a dance here , a party there , a smoker or an evening of cards . With the right persons , naturally . Soon his name had become familiar to the entire class ; even those who did not know him had heard of Rollin . He did not ruin himself by being queer , did not write poems or go in for dramatics ; with a smile on his face he would walk into a mid-year examination protesting , " I have n't looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of the education offered by the University ; his was an accepting rather than an inquiring mind and he never questioned the universe of which he was a part . Not an athlete himself , he played only golf ( this was before the game had become a national obsession ) ; but somehow he consorted with all the great ones of our earth . He managed the freshman football eleven and naturally was in line to manage the varsity in his senior year . He roomed with the captain of the eleven and Ridgway the intercollegiate champion pole vaulter . In addition he found time to run the glee club and make the two best junior societies , Stylus and the Obelisk . His intercourse with the elect helped his advancement ; yet his amiable nature and his sunny smile were not small factors in his progress . Our first meeting after college took place one night in my Brigade Headquarters in France . No shelling had come our way for days , and that farm house with its covered windows and curtained doors was about as dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to be at the switchboard , the telephone corporal at my side , when suddenly there was a sound of boots on stone . It was Old Ironsides , as we called the Corps commander ; though what Old Ironsides could be doing so far from home was hard to imagine . He stood there glaring at me , an aide hovering discreetly in the dim recesses of the room . " What outfit is this ? " " Two Hundred Ninety-eighth Field Artillery Brigade , sir . " " Oh .. . you in charge , Lieuten-ant ? " " Yes , sir , for the moment . " Again he glared . By his look he disliked me far more than the enemy . Doubtless he did . " Do n't you know it is contrary to regulations to have a light so near the lines ? " So near the lines ! I wanted to retail the current doughboy crack : " The Germans have a gun that will throw a shell fifty-eight miles to Paris . " " Aw , that 's nothing . They even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But the general was in no mood for a joke . Generals seldom are . So I merely assented . " Then why the blankety blank blank have you got those candles lighted ? " I tried to explain that I was trying to keep in touch with our forward batteries , their observing officers , and the infantry in the trenches as well as other headquarters along the lines , that one could n't very well run a complicated switchboard in blackness . . . He interrupted . " Put those out , " he said , turning to his aide . The aide , a lieutenant , advanced with alacrity . Like the General , he was clothed in the smartest of uniforms with fashionably flaring light-colored breeches , a shiny Sam Browne , and boots polished to a degree . Suddenly I realized that my shoes were covered with dubbin ; that my last shave had been fifty hours before . It seemed fifty years . The Immaculate One tiptoed daintily across the flagging and blew out a candle . His face came into the light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he crossed over to blow out the other candle he tossed a glance my way . His eyebrows lifted . His lips moved . " Hullo there , " he seemed to say . Then darkness . Steps on the stone , and the two warriors vanished on their job of winning the war . An hour later our Brigade Major , who was a regular , came in cursing at the darkness . I told him the story . Immediately he ordered the corporal to light the candles . " Does n't the old fool know there 's a war on ? " he said . The incident was forgotten , but not Rollin . Our next meeting occurred in the little ruined town of Dilontfaucon after it had been captured . Already the 4th Engineers had built that marvellous road past Avrocourt and Septsarges , and we were halted in the square when up bumped a huge olive-colored Cadillac bursting with generals perched uncomfortably in the rear , while in front with the chauffeur sat Rollin , his smart figure a contrast to those corpulent old gentlemen whose Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out as the car stopped and , running around to the rear door , stood stiffly at attention , truly an elegant figure . The generals bolted into a temporary headquarters by the roadside ; then Rollin noticed me and came over , his face alight just as it used to be as he passed you on the campus . " Hullo there . " His apparent eagerness to see me was touching . The same old Rollin ! My first observation as we shook hands was that he had received well-merited advancement since our last encounter . Not only was he a captain ; his ribbons and decorations had multiplied . Being on the staff , he could explain to me just what Pershing was trying to du , something that had long been vague in my mind . The generals reappeared . Hastily Rollin scribbled an address on his card . " Captain Rollin Thorndyke , A. D. C. to General Blandenberger , G. 5 , G. H. Q. Fifth Echelon . " I never found out what Fifth Echelon meant , but it was all perfectly in keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the door of the car , and hopped in front to bump off amid the ironic remarks of the mud-soaked engineers by the roadside . Coming home on the Aquitania , whom should I run into again but Rollin . Now a Lieutenant-Colonel , he rated a special suite with bath on A Deck , whereas , like the other lieutenants , I was in second class , four to a room . But Rollin was always thoughtful ; he used to let me come up and use his shower . Meanwhile his decorations had increased with his advancement in the service ; the rows of ribbons over his left chest had tripled , his breast was a garden where geraniums and gentians , forget-me-nots and phlox , lilies and roses blossomed . There were several hundred members of the Army Nurse Corps on board ; and I leave you to guess that of all the officers , Rollin was the general favorite of the ladies . Again he was as kind and agreeable as possible . I remember that once he called me over to his table in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trifle uneasy amid all those bedecked and beribboned staff officers ; doubtless Rollin noticed this , for tactfully he brought the subject around to decorations , explaining how he had received his . That Croix de Guerre ? That was for jamming the gears of a Ford and driving backward from Verdun to Bar-le-Due in ' 16 . That red and white affair ? The Cross of St. Michael . Oh , that was for pulling a Serbian prince into the roadside during a flurry of Boche planes over Dun-sur-Meuse . So it went . Apparently not a single one had been given for valor in action . Needless to say , Rollin 's chaffing modesty deceived none of us at the table . Naturally it was easy to see why Rollin was bound to get ahead in Wall Street , where he appeared soon after demobilization . His smile , his cheery manner , and his war record were a passport to a job with the Security Corporation , an affiliate of the Security Trust Company ; but it took more than a pleasing personality to reach the place he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , as you know , was the largest Trust Company in the world , had a Chairman of the Board , a President , 14 vice-presidents , 59 assistantvice-presidents , a vice-president and controller , an auditor and 16 assistant auditors , 18 trust officers , a treasurer and 19 assistant treasurers , and a secretary and 17 assistant secretaries . What a line-up for Rollin , at that time only a private in the rear rank , to face ! But he was not long to remain in that humble position . As in the army , so in American business you can not keep a good man down . His first rise , curiously enough , came to him through sport . Rollin was no athlete but he happened to carry over from college a liking and an ability for golf . That first summer saw him come to the front when the Investment Bankers Association held their annual convention at Atlantic City . Rollin ran down , not as a delegate but as an individual , for , as he explained , you could never tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the office hooted . But the laugh was on them . For two days Rollin hung about , unobserved and unnoticed ( a new experience ) . Consequently on the final Saturday afternoon there was nothing for him to do but play in the annual golf tournament of the Association , a sorry affair with twelve contestants and four wives as spectators . Of course Rollin won easily , to the delight of a little old man who followed him around the last six holes . Afterward the old gentleman stepped up and politely complimented Rollin , and thereupon asked him for some help to correct a troublesome slice . With infinite patience the younger man spent an hour alone on the fairway explaining , hitting balls , watching the old duller drive endless shots into the distance . " Where do you work ? " asked the older man as they came into the clubhouse . " Security , " said Rollin , pride in his voice . If it was not the Bankers or the Farmers or the Guaranty , after all the Security was the Security . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then after a minute , " Like to have you come down to my place at Rum-son . Girl plays a good game , " and he held out his card . Rollin , unimpressed but ever courteous , thanked him and put the card in his pocket . Nor was he other than his normal cheery self when they chanced to meet going up in the elevator in the Security Trust Building the next morning . " Hullo there , " said Rollin with that natural smile and that unaffectedly cordial tone as ever conveying the impression that he had simply been counting the minutes since their parting . But if he was not unduly excited , one of his fellow-clerks in the elevator was . " Say .. . you . . . you know the Old Man ? " stammered the clerk as they went to their desks . Rollin , ever alert , hesitated and then mumbled an assent . He pulled the card from his pocketbook , and read : " J. Otis Clump , Chairman of the Board , Security Trust Company . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his success to luck ? But it does not seem to me that that is quite fair . It would have been the easiest thing in the world for him to have married Rosamund Clump and worked gently into a private room and an important job at the Security . That was not Rollin 's way . He preferred to rise on his own shoulders rather than on those of a father-in-law . Yet one can not gainsay the fact that the friendship of the Chairman of the Board of the Security Trust was an enormous benefit . It was at Rumson that Rollin met Percy Matthews , healthy , athletic , good-looking , intelligent , if not intellectually brilliant . For years Percy Matthews had been thinking of bringing new blood into the firm of Mason &; Matthews , an old conservative investment house to be characterized perfectly by the factthat at the age of fifty-seven he was still junior partner . Like everyone , he was immediately attracted to Rollin . ( Young . Marvellous war record . Lieutenant Colonel at twenty-eight . Must have good business head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security . ) For some time he studied Rollin closely . He observed him , completely without gene in the living room of the Clumps at Rumson , surrounded by big financiers , industrial magnates , giants of the Street and their womenfolk ; he noticed him ever natural and unaffected , liked by and liking everyone . But it was a casual remark of Rollin 's which most impressed Percy Matthews . At the moment we were going through the worst of the slump ? at least that is what we called it in those days ? of the nee period . Someone asked Rollin what the market was likely to do in 1923 . During a sudden pause in the conversation Rollin 's voice could be heard . " Stocks may go up or stocks may go down ; the American nation will always go ahead . " There was authority , there was conviction in his tone ; not a person in the room was unaffected by the remark , and every business man present was led to ask under his breath , " Who 's that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ten minutes later Percy Matthews engaged him in a chance conversation which ended in an appointment to lunch the following week at India House . Toward the end of the month the New York newspapers carried an item ? in small print as befitted an old established firm such as Mason &; Matthews ? on their financial pages , reading " Beginning October 1st , Mr. Rollin Thorndyke , late of the Security Corporation , will become associated with our firm . " Now Rollin 's best asset was the fact that he harmonized with any background . At the Security he was modern , brisk , efficient , snappy , up to the minute ; in the musty old offices of Mason &; Matthews on Cedar Street he was a quiet , well-bred , modest young financier , eager , unassuming , anxious to learn . Then , as usual , luck helped him . Eight months after leaving the Security , old Mason died , making Percy Matthews senior partner . To him Rollin , fortified by twenty-eight months ' knowledge of the investment business , came with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Percy Matthews smiled . Leaning back in his chair , he explained tolerantly that bank stocks were not an investment ; they were a rich man 's hobby , like a yacht , a race horse , or a mistress . But Rollin was in earnest . He countered with facts . He had been studying the situation and he had facts which Percy Matthews had not previously put together . He went back before the War , quoted figures . What about Farmers at 256 in 1913 , now quoted at 490 , after a four for one split ? Or Commerce at 168 in the summer of 1914 , now over 300 ? Bank stocks , he insisted , were not a speculation ; they could be made an attractive feature to the conservative investing public . M. &; M. with its sound banking record was the firm to put them across . He pleaded , begged , argued , demanded a chance to show what could be done . He offered to do night work . He did do night work . Six months , eight months went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A small section of the investing public was taking an interest in his wares . I am now telling you the inside story of the rise of Rollin Thorndyke , the great financial authority . By his persistence and personality Rollin put new life into the age-worn house of Mason &; Matthews . What had become a side issue gradually grew in importance . Other offers came his way , but he did not listen ; a small firmwith a good name , a firm capable of expansion , the confidence of the senior partner , and a chance to show what he could do , that was all he asked . When in a circular letter to clients he first advocated the careful selection of certain gilt-edged bank stocks in every balanced investment portfolio , friends of M. &; M. raised their eyebrows . When over his name as " Head of Bank Stock Department , " he advised the immediate purchase of Corn Exchange on the strength of its coming capital increase , clients of the firm in their chair cars on the 4.35 to Morristown or the 5.10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but fewer smiled tolerantly when the increase came as predicted . Some time later Rollin openly suggested that a merger of the Manufacturers Trust with the Fifth and Gotham National Banks was in the offing . At this Percy Matthews called him aside and advised him not to go so fast . However on the side he bought a little Manufacturers at 275 . When after the merger that stock went to over 500 , he did not regret his purchase . By the end of his second year with M. &; M. , Rollin had made a small name for himself on the Street . That summer , despite the increasing press of work , he managed to take a month 's vacation abroad . I was a ship 's news man at the time and happened to meet him on the sun deck of the Berengaria just before sailing . He was as immaculate and handsome as usual . When he saw me his face lighted up . " Hullo there . " " Hullo Rollin . " I realized immediately that he had forgotten my first name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Besides , with newspapermen one never knows , does one ? " Anything for us ? " I asked . " Certainly , " he answered , obliging as ever , while I pulled the back of an envelope from my pocket to write on . Talking to an old friend , he was naturally able to let himself go , and I needed more than the back of that envelope . Our late editions carried an interesting and exclusive story from Rollin Thorndyke of Mason &; Matthews , investment-expert , who was sailing for a short vacation during which he hoped to investigate banking conditions in France and England . His statement began : " We are living to-day in a new era in which formerly well-established standards of value for securities no longer retain their old significance . " And so on and so on for a column interspersed with impressive phrases such as " changes in income yields vary with changes in our civilization , " " owing to the shifting economic status of the United States from a debtor to a creditor nation we have entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years than we have enjoyed for the past ten . " He was careful not to stress unduly the first person singular , but everyone who read the piece instantly said , " Ah , that 's Thorndyke , the bank stock authority . " Toward the end of 1927 the financial columns of the metropolitan dailies carried this advertisement within a discreet border : " We take pleasure in announcing the inclusion of Rollin Thorndyke , Esq. , as a member of our firm . On and after January 1st our address will be changed from 49 Cedar Street to 120 Broadway , New York . " Even as early as this you would hardly have recognized Mason &; Matthews . Or Rollin either . When I called on him for an interview there was still a flash of the old Rollin , the greeting , the cheery smile , the cordial handshake . But his well-trimmed hairwas etched with gray , and there was a furrow between his eyes as he sat at the huge desk in that elegant corner room with its vast panorama over the harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One felt however that he saw little of the pageant far below . Two telephones on his desk trilled continually ; it seemed that as fast as he answered one , the other demanded him . Several silent and capable goddesses moved back and forth at his command across the thickly carpeted floor . Before his fingers was a row of buttons , red , green , blue . He pressed one , and an efficient youth ( Yale 1920 and Babson Institute 1924 ) appeared out of the wall with a gunfire of answers to his sharp , curt questions ; he pressed another button and a well-groomed elderly man who looked to me like a bank president came and listened suavely to his orders . It was thrilling to be on the inside of big business in this way , and my imagination responded as I watched Rollin at work , a general , no , a field marshal arranging his forces , directing his huge armies in that mighty financial war . I say huge armies , for Mason &; Matthews with their tiny offices on Cedar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vast organization of three hundred and sixty-two office boys , stenographers , secretaries , clerks , auditors , cashiers , statisticians , stock specialists , traders , junior executives , and officers . Especially important were the statisticians who , having lately graduated from the Harvard Business School , were able to plot out the future course of stocks , bonds , and commodities . Yes , an immense organization , and the dynamo at the center of it was Rollin . " Excuse me a minute , old boy . Have a seat , will you ? " Impossible not to like him , impossible not to be flattered by the way in which the great man remembered his old and humble friends . " Miss King ! Change that B 292 , going out to-morrow . Third page , second paragraph . Add this . . . " An automaton in a cool green dress , who was a young girl with hopes and fears and a mother in Montclair crippled by sciatica and a boy friend who held her hand in his Ford , stood motionless before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes downward . " A man who in 1902 bought five shares of Equitable Trust Company . . . no no , wait a minute " ? his hand passed nervously over that furrowed brow ? " Do you realize that if you had bought five shares of Equitable Trust Company in 1902 . . no . . five hundred thousand dollars invested in bank stocks in 1918 would he worth nearly two million dollars to-day ? That same five hundred thousand invested in gilt-edged bonds would be worth to-day a little more than six hundred thousand . Purchased and held on an outright cash basis , the stocks of banking institutions are relatively immune , however , to speculative fluctuations . The element of risk in the conduct of banking institutions is minimized by regulatory laws , both State and Federal . As instanced in the above estimate , sound investment practices applied to bank stocks provide a substantial yield on capital involved . For these reasons we recommend New York bank and trust company stocks for the conservative investor . " It was in the following year that Rollin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered to the general public . Needless to say , it was an enormous success , although , like many other such trusts set up then and later , it was framed with a remarkable lack of foresight , a curious neglect ( as it seems now ) of ordinary precautions . For Rollin was a creation of the Big Bull Market . Unlike Percy Matthews who had lived and suffered through thepanic of 1907 , Rollin came to fruition on an upward trend ; he visualized only a long era of constantly rising prices . On this assumption his investment trust was formed despite the sage ( but , it must be admitted , tentative ) objections of the senior partner of the firm of Mason &; Matthews . The objections were overruled by the manner in which the public snapped up Bank Stock Investors , Inc . The shares were well over-subscribed before the date of issue . Rollin anticipated as much and was hardly surprised at the reception they obtained . Of course Bank Stock Investors , Inc. , was different , he pointed out . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chemical and ended with Woolworth , Rollin 's started with American Exchange Irving , and ended with United States Trust Company . Put out at 18 , in three months it was quoted at 45 . No , he was not astonished at this either . Lunching one day with the financial editor of my paper at the Bankers Club , I happened to see Rollin in a corner putting over some big deal with Calvin Bullock . Albert Wiggin , just back from London , stopped to speak to them and gave Rollin a friendly hand ; later on George Whitney passed by and engaged him in conversation . As Rollin made his way out , greeting an acquaintance here , nodding across the room to someone else , two young bond salesmen at the next table spoke to each other in the tones one uses in talking about the world 's heavyweight boxing champion or a transatlantic flyer . " Thorndyke . Yeah , that 's Thorn-dyke . " Had they not seen his picture in the rotogravure sections , snapped on the beach at Southampton or with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genial , and important , with what seemed to me to be envious eyes . Even my financial editor was not immune ; and although he pretended to be unconcerned when Rollin saw me and gave me the same cheery smile of pleasant and unaffected delight at meeting an old friend , he was impressed just the same . About this period Rollin 's name began to appear as a director in other investment trusts and new corporations along with other big men of Wall Street . How he succeeded in getting in on these good things I do not precisely know . But clearly he was getting a reputation for conservative sound financial judgment : how could he help getting it when the stocks which he selected rose so impressively in price ? And his friends were an asset too . It was extraordinary how Rollin made friends , in college , in the army , in business ; and how those friends helped him . Even more extraordinary to me was the fact that his new acquaintances invariably happened to be persons of wealth and position . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of always finding that his new friends were men who belonged to the Brook and the St. Nicholas Club , that they had seats on the Stock Exchange and tiny places of three hundred and fifty acres on Long Island with kennels , stables , a private beach , a shooting preserve , and an aviation field . These men , the salt of the earth , were the kind of persons who sought him out ; which was fortunate for Rollin because they were leaders in American finance , sport , and society . Naturally in no time at all Rollin became one of the leaders also . Soon after he joined Mason &; Matthews he was taken into the Knickerbocker Club ; soon after he floated his super-investment trust he became a member of the Brook . His successes were merely another proof that there is in this country nothing corresponding to the class snobbery which rules European life , that even the humblest lad can still work up to a position of importance . Just exactly how much Rollin was worth or how much he made yearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich indeed . Yet he never forgot his old friends . His " Hullo there , " as from time to time I penetrated into his inner office , was as hearty and sincere as ever . Many were the exclusive stories of financial conditions that his friendship brought my paper . Once also Rollin generously permitted me to get in on one of his investment trusts ? in my small way ? before the general public were admitted . I have never forgotten that kindness . Iv I have often wondered whether Rollin smiled inwardly when asked to address the Bankers Association in late September of 1929 . Probably not , for a sense of humor was hardly one of his most noticeable assets . But he could scarcely have failed to remember that first convention he had attended after the War when he was nothing but the Association golf champion . Except for an occasional game late in the afternoon or during the week ends with his friends on Long Island , he seldom played now . Naturally his speech was tumultuously received . Rollin was an excellent speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late years had only added force to his spoken word and authority to his opinion . Moreover , his position as well as his insight into business fundamentals gave great importance to his every utterance ; there must have been a dozen of us reporters at the convention when lie rose to speak . For after all , here was a man who knew , a man really on the inside , who was so placed as to be able to observe the shifting currents of finance and to draw farsighted deductions about the trend of American business . Bankers from the country districts , far removed from the center of affairs , felt privileged to be able to hear one of the really big men of the period . Just think , they were probably saying to themselves , fifty years ago a man of Thorndyke 's importance would have been inaccessible except to a chosen few . And here he was , talking right to them , as easily and calmly as he might talk across the table in some directors ' room ! In politics Rollin was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to intrude his own personal views , he did believe intensely in the continuation of Coolidge policies as a necessity to sustained prosperity throughout the country . " It is my belief . . . " he paused a second to sweep the room with his glance , a handsome , smartly groomed man in the prime of life physically and mentally , confident of himself and his work , " . . it is my belief that the election of Herbert Hoover last November assured the continuation of our steady advance toward greater and greater prosperity , and that in years to come we shall look hack to this year 1929 and realize that we had barely scratched the surface of American industrial progress . " This was well received . So were his remarks a minute later when he silenced the croakers and pessimists in short order . " There is nothing to worry about in the financial situation of the United States . Industrial conditions in this country are absolutely sound , and I can assure you that our credit situation is in no way artificial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks , the fact remains that the present bull market is based on confidence in the soundness of American business and in the possibility of future growth . " And he ended his speech with a phrase which swept those hard-headed business men completely off their feet , " Gentlemen , we are only at the start of a period thatwill go down in history as the golden age . " Curiously enough it was just at this moment , at the start of the period that was to go down in history as the golden age , that I had my first misgiving about Rollin . After the annual dinner of the Association that night I happened to overhear a few words of a conversation between Rollin and old Julius Rothenberg of the banking firm of Rothenberg Brothers . The original Rothenberg came to this country from Frankfurt am Main generations ago ; the family had been steeped in banking and banking lore until it was in their blood . It was interesting to watch Julius Rothenberg and Rollin together : the gray-haired man with the thin ascetic face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuasive , dynamic , masterful . Rothenberg was talking to Rollin about International Copper , which Rollin had advised his clients to get in on in 1927 at 43 ; 1 , and again in 1928 at 127 . Rollin knew everything about International Copper , I said to myself as I stood listening to the two men ; did n't his statisticians have at their fingers ' tips every earnings statement , every production graph , did n't Rollin himself run out to Glen Cove every now and then on the speedboat of the Chairman of the Board , and hobnob with two of the directors at the Knickerbocker Club ? Probably at this very moment Rollin knew whether or not I. C. was going to issue rights again this autumn , and whether there was a new syndicate being organized to take the stock to 150 . But it was n't about stock rights that the old Jewish banker was talking . He was discussing Chilean polities , asking Rollin whether he thought the insurgent faction was capably led and how the present situation compared with that in 1891 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little uncertain and ill at ease . And as Rothenberg put in a question about the political sympathies of the district in which the International Copper mines were located , for just a moment Rollin 's face went quite blank . He shifted , answered the question noncommittally , and turned the talk to something else . In that moment a doubt assailed me : did Rollin really know what an investment expert ought to know about International Copper , or was it to him a symbol on the ticker tape , a collection of annual reports and earnings statements and " information not guaranteed but obtained from sources believed to be reliable , " a plaything of promoters and pool managers ? The doubt did not last long , however . I recalled that Rollin 's financial judgment had been proved right again and again . Did he not have an army of research men at his call ? Was he not right at the financial nexus , the brain-center where decisions were made and issues decided for the whole financial and industrial world ? And after all , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of over-cautious investment to be in tune with the new America which Rollin represented , and which was to usher us into the golden age ? V The crash shook Rollin momentarily ; far more , in fact , than I appreciated at the time . Outwardly he did not lose faith in America or in the fundamental soundness of the whole American financial system , but talking with him over the telephone in December of that fatal year , / thought I noticed an uncertainty in his voice , usually so buoyant . " Present conditions .. . h 'm . . . point to a fairly short period of depression . I .. . ah . . . believe that by next July those businesses which are run scientifically will have reached a stage on a level with the normal of last year . The deflation of values has been an excellent thing because it proved that the financial institutions of this country are built on a rock of security . " He became much more cheerful during the bull market of the early spring of 1930 , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , when I managed to get in to see him , the change in his appearance shocked me . The cool , confident Rollin was disappearing ; some of his jaunty assurance was actually gone . To be sure , he issued as usual a bullish statement for my exclusive use , yet I had a queer feeling that possibly after all my idol had , if not feet of clay , feet somewhat insecurely fastened to this earth . However his firm advertisements and the statements that poured forth from his office reassured me somewhat . Here is a typical one which found its way to my desk : " After a careful survey of the entire bank stock situation , we recommend for permanent investment at this time , ignoring immediate fluctuations , the stocks of the following banks : " In the case of each of these banks there are definite prospects of either capital increases , stock split-ups , or expansion by merger , or all three . We are confident that our clients who buy any of these bank stocks now will insure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strange to say , Rollin 's clients who bought had losses on their purchases and not handsome profits . This too must have upset him , for when by accident we happened to meet on Broadway one day I was shocked at the change in my old friend . Deep lines furrowed his face . His hair was more markedly tinged with gray . He was flabby under the cheeks ; about the corners of his eyes he looked weary and worn . For the first time his optimism seemed forced . His remarks lacked that precision which one thought of in connection with Rollin . " If we all buckle down to our jobs prosperity will be hack again before we realize it . " This vagueness one did not associate with him ; it was the kind of a statement that might have come from any business service . I was disappointed . Our paths did not cross again until the end of that year , 1930 , when I went around to his office for an interview . Much of the stage-setting of 1929 was missing ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapping a pencil as I came in and sat down ; scarcely had we started to talk when a stenographer interrupted us . " St. Louis Post Dispatch on the wire , Mr. Thorndyke . They want a statement from you about business conditions in 1931 . " Rollin cleared his throat . He drew himself up ; for just a minute all the old fire was there . " Tell ' em . . . tell ' em . . . " He hesitated a minute . I felt embarrassed . Something within him was failing to click . He looked over at me despairingly . " Hey , Johnny , old boy , what the hell 'll I say to those people down there ? " All through this trying period Percy Matthews ' confidence in Rollin was moving . He counted not on Hoover nor on Congress nor on a rise in commodity prices nor on the settlement of the situation abroad , but on his younger and more active partner . Was not Rollin the man who had built the firm from nothing ? Could he not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly in the summer of 1931 came the news of Rollin 's resignation . Told baldly , it sounds like the story of a desertion . I admit this was my first reaction on hearing of Rollin 's move . But when he had explained it to me in terms of modern business I saw there was nothing of that nature in his leaving Mason , Matthews &; Thorndyke . A man has a certain period of usefulness to a certain firm . When that period comes to an end he owes it to himself and to the members of the firm to resign . He should not wait to be asked to leave . Circumstances over which neither individuals nor houses have any control often bring about these conditions . When the occasion arises , the only thing to do is to act at whatever risk ! As Rollin went into it in detail I realized more fully his unselfishness . Besides , be added as an afterthought , Percy Matthews was an old man now . Their firm had really seen its best days . It was not progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the tide or go under . Now young Ned Kilbourne , with whom he was going into partnership , was a real live wire . Of course he knew nothing about banking , but Rollin would teach him all that . Their offices were to be small at the start ; that , however , was exactly what he wanted , a small house capable of expansion when normal times returned , not one of those big inflated houses with tremendous overhead eating up your profits . Moreover , this would give him an opportunity to prove what he could do as a senior member of the firm . That was all he asked , all anyone could ask . Unfortunately normal times did not return as fast as Rollin anticipated , and with every succeeding month of 1931 his gloom deepened . It was not so much that his own fortune had shrunk to nothing as that his world seemed also to have diminished in importance ; all the things he held of value were falling to pieces before his eyes . He was stunned . He could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost as a personal insult . He blamed Hoover , about whom he had formerly been enthusiastic . Those endless conferences , those commissions . What was the man doing anyhow ? Talk , talk , talk . The country needed action , not talk , at a time like this . Now Mussolini , ah , there was a man for you . He did n't talk , he acted . What this country needed was a Mussolini . Later on Rollin blamed Congress . Congress was a bunch of useless old wind-bags . No real appreciation of what the sound business men of this country were going through . If Congress would only balance the budget and adjourn , the business leaders of the country might have some chance to set things straight again . What we needed was less government in business . wanted to ask him if he were referring to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation when he said this , but I did n't . He was too low in his mind . During this period Rollin was lower than Bank Stock Investors , Inc. which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1932 I ran into him stepping into a taxicab at dusk one night in front of 80 Broadway , his new offices . The sight reassured me . It was comforting to observe that in spite of the precarious condition of the gold standard , despite the virtual bankruptcy of Europe and the ten millions of unemployed in our native land , Rollin had not yet been reduced to riding uptown in the subway . But in our brief conversation he dwelt on none of these topics , rather on his own enormous losses and those of his friends . For just a few minutes I was able to forget the spiritual and material sufferingof humanity in Rollin 's greater troubles . For Rollin seemed to have the idea that he and his friends were bearing the brunt of the depression . The vagrant unemployed were to be pitied , perhaps , but they at least were free men with no commitments to meet , no taxes to pay to extravagant governments , no capital to watch dwindling in value , no burdens of responsibility to bear . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the spring his bewilderment increased , and I heard indirectly that he was concerned about the danger of a revolution . Rollin bad more or less dropped out of the public eye ; for some time he had refused to be quoted in print , maintaining that it was undignified for a banker to be talking continually in the newspapers . His name had not been prominent either as heading new investment trusts or as a director in new corporations . Possibly that was undignified also ; or could it be that investment trusts and new corporations were no longer in the making ? For six months or more I had heard nothing about Rollin until we met by accident one day last August . " Hullo there . . . " His eagerness to see me was touching . It was pleasant , too , to observe that much of his former buoyancy and cheerfulness seemed to have returned . He insisted on taking me up to see his new offices and introducing me to the other partners . No use talking ; in American business you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also to notice that he had recovered much of his spontaneity and effervescence . Helped by the stock market rise of the summer , he had forgotten all about revolutions ; once more he was a bull on America and sound American stocks . The same old Rollin , and not afraid to put himself on record either . His offices , it is true , were small compared to those of M. M. &; T. in the heyday of their pomp but , as he showed me , they were capable of being enlarged . Their small force was being whipped into a compact and aggressive sales organization , ready , so he said , for expansion the moment we had " normal times " again . What did he think of the present situation ? " Boy , the folks who bought good sound bank stocks during this past summer have laid the foundation not merely for a well-balanced investment program but for the great fortunes of to-morrow . They have built for future prosperity . " I wanted to ask him about the people who had bought these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his enthusiasm prevented . " Here . . . read this . . . just sending it out to a selected list .. . old clients of the firm . . . " I read . And for a second or two it seemed to me that I was back again in that huge corner room at 52 Wall Street with all its expensive furniture and elaborate paraphernalia , that Rollin was the Rollin of old , that National City Bank was really worth 585 , and Charlie Mitchell was really a financial wizard . I took the sheet he extended and read it almost as in a dream . Was this 193 or 1N9 ? Vaguely I felt in his printed words the old familiar ring , the old Rollin refrain . " New York Bank stocks have in many instances advanced as much as one hundred per cent over the low levels of last spring . The recent action of bank shares shows them to be in a sound technical position and would tend to instill confidence in the minds of investors . Now is the moment to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world at a time when unheard of yields of six , seven , or even eight per cent on unquestionable security are obtainable . This firm , backed by years of experience in the bank stock field , recommends particularly at current levels instant purchase of the shares of Security Trust Company , Fidelity Mutual Trust Company , and the Fourth Avenue National Bank , all of which we believe to be conservatively priced . " " Sound technical position . " " Investment in the biggest financial institutions in the world . " There was a reminiscent tone to the tune . Before leaving I wanted to get the benefit of Rollin 's years of experience in the field and ask about my Bank Stock Investors , Inc. and my eleven hundred and seventy-eight dollars , now worth at least a hundred and sixty-two fifty . But no . . . one could hardly burden a big man of Wall Street with picayune personal problems . I left without even mentioning the matter .                @ @ @ @ @
