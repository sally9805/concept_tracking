CANNIBAL CARAVAN-Charles ( " Cannibal " ) Miller-Furman ( $2.75 ) . <P> Sunk in the plateau that surrounds the Sterren Mountains , snow-capped backbone of Netherlands New Guinea , is a triangular-shaped , 40-acre swamp with no visible outlet . On hands and knees , Charles Miller gazed down into its reeds . A quarter mile away something moved . Charles Miller 's blood froze . Lashing across the swamp was a dinosaur . It was 35 feet long , a yellowish color , with scales laid on like armor plate , a bony-flanged head , and snappin-turtle beak . Half blinded by cold sweat , Charles Miller pressed the release on his camera. * The dinosaur reared up on its hind legs , its small forelegs dangling , hissed roaringly , shot its snaky neck in his direction and slithered out of sight . Concluding that his rifle would be " about as useful as citronella , " Explorer Miller fled . <P> Ex-barnstorming aviator and Hollywood cameraman , Miller tells as many tall ones as Trader Horn , makes some of them sound convincing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he began his jungle jaunts at five , and while still an adolescent became a blood brother of the Marind-Anim tribe .

As other races use lanterns , flags and bunting for celebrations , the natives of New Guinea string up their victims ' vertebrae . <P> Adventurer Miller tells how boys ' noses are bored to take inch-wide bamboo plugs in each nostril , how a native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acrid odor . . . like smoke from a bonfire of rubber boots " ) , how a trail-cutter can die from a cobra bite before hitting the ground . His accounts of jungle sex are more colorful if less accurate than an anthropologist 's . For squeamish readers there is always the dedication : " To Mother and Dad .
