Last week the 45,000,000 citizens of Brazil celebrated two anniversaries-their 50th as a Republic , their second as a dictatorship . In honor of the occasion , plump Dictator-President Getulio Vargas proclaimed a paternal decree setting up a national commission for the protection of parents with many children. * <P> Guns cracked , the green-and-yellow flag of Brazil fluttered in the warm November breeze , the burghers of Rio de Janeiro lifted many a frosty glass to the traditional boast-toast : " God is a Brazilian . " <P> Beaming on the whole proceedings was the U. S. , South America 's Good Neighbor who wants to show Latin Americans that she is not only Good , but the Very Best . This week , to Rio de Janeiro , in seven 23-ton bombers , flew 56 Army fliers on a 6,000-mile , four-stop good-will flight to salute Senhor Vargas . <P> These 56 ambassadors signalized their Government 's intensive new selling campaign . Its objects : 1 ) to sell U. S. business a closer relationship with Latin America ; 2 ) to sell Latin America the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys among the 21 Republics in the Western Hemisphere . <P> In this same spirit , Washington last week was a welter of Pan-American projects , studies , conferences . An Inter-American cultural conference ended on a note of far-reaching program-planning . In Guatemala City , Treasury representatives of the 21 Republics met to ponder financial ways &; means . Secretary of State Cordell Hull announced conclusion of a reciprocal trade agreement with Venezuela ( eleventh with a Latin-American nation , 22nd in all ) , " progress " on new agreements with Argentina , Chile and Uruguay . Secretary of Commerce Harry L. Hopkins had his experts meet with Latin-American tourist-bureau chiefs to plot travel increases . <P> Over the whole U. S. , however , there was not this same rosy , reciprocal glow . In October Senator Arthur Capper of Kansas complained in a letter to Mr. Hull that the proposed Argentine trade agreement would injure the U. S. farmer and cattleman . Last week he got back a restrained but politely savage answer that it was " folly compounded " for farm spokesmen in the light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delusion that the farmer has something to gain from embargo or tariffs . " <P> Wisconsin cheesemen , Midwest cattlemen and wheat-growers were hot under their open collars , fearing the impact of Argentine imports on their markets . Gov William H. Vanderbilt of Rhode Island 's well-starched collar was also warm . Citing his State 's lace industry , he threatened last month to take suit to the Supreme Court against the Trade Agreements Act 's constitutionality . He too got back a politely savage letter , requesting him to note that the Rhode Island lace industry , under three years of agreements , had recovered almost 100% of its 1929 volume of $27,000,000 . Senators Pittman of Nevada , Borah of Idaho , had already served notice that next session they would seek to regain the Senate 's power to approve trade agreements .
