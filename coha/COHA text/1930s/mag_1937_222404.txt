When Myron Charles Taylor of U. S. Steel and John Llewellyn Lewis of C. I. O. sealed their historic bargain last March , most observers sighed with relief , assumed that the threat of a great steel strike which had been hanging over the nation for months was ended . They reckoned , however , without Steel 's major " independents " - Bethlehem , Republic , Youngstown Sheet &; Tube , National , Jones &; Laughlin , Crucible , Inland , American Rolling Mill-to whom Big Steel 's concession was a shocking betrayal of the industry 's traditional united front against unionism . <P> As most of the smaller independents fell in line and signed up with C. I. O. 's Steel Workers Organizing Committee , the larger companies , employing more than 200,000 men and producing about one-fourth of the nation 's steel , continued stubborn holdouts . When the Supreme Court certified the Wagner Act , their resistance took a subtle turn . They were entirely willing to bargain with S. W. O. C. and perhaps to enter into agreements with it-but they would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were strictly within their legal rights : the Wagner Act requires only bargaining , not written contracts . But S. W. O. C. 's Chairman Philip Murray , determined to win all he could while Recovery and Rearmament were booming steel production to alltime highs , cried last fortnight : " I tell you a strike will inevitably trail in the wake of this maddening policy . " <P> One night last week at grim Aliquippa , Pa. , 25 miles down the Ohio River from Pittsburgh , flames leaping up from great Jones &; Laughlin blast furnaces flickered over the tense , expectant faces of thousands of men , women and children massed outside the five-mile-long plant 's gates . Sharp at 11 p. m. came the deadline which Jones &; Laughlin 's C. I. O. unionists had set when they voted to strike unless the corporation signed a union contract . Marching out of J. &; L. plants both in Aliquippa and Pittsburgh , the unionists shut down the nation 's fourth largest steel producer , threw 27,000 men out of work , started the biggest U. S. steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pittsburgh Steel Co. struck , too . <P> There was to be no repetition of 1919 's violence . Aliquippa 's police chief decided once that the C. I. O. pickets looked threatening , tossed a few tear gas bombs at them . Strikers battered a U. S. mail truck which they thought was taking ammunition into the plant . A few hardy non-unionists tried to crash the picket lines , best scrap being put up by irate old H. L. Queen , longtime company storekeeper . " I 've got a job and I 'm going to it , " cried he . When pickets seized him , H. L. Queen sank his teeth into a striker 's hand ( see cut ) , was dragged away with bleeding lips .
