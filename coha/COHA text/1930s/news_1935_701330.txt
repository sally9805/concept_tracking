txt Fourteen recommendations to save the taxpayers of New York City a least $2,712,181a year , simplify court procedure and increase the efficiency of the courts were proposed yesterday in a report urging the reorganization of the city 's judicial system under a central administrative body . The specific proposals call for , the- abolition , of some courts and judicial offices , the consolidation and centralization of others and the substitution of still others . William Church Osborn transmitted the report as chairman of the Citizens Budget Commission to Kenneth Dayton , chairman of the Committee on the Cost of Administration of the Courts of the City of New York . The committee was organized in March , 1934 , with a membership composed of representatives of the city government , the bench , bar associations and business organizations . For the last year the commission has been making a survey of the city 's sixteen court systems and 2,000 court employes , exclusive of judges , on beLaif of the committee . The survey was supervised by a subcommittee of the Dayton committee , consisting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tanzer , representing respectively the Association of the Bar of the City of New York , the Brooklyn Bar Association and the Merchants Association . Mandatory Laws Assailed .. Besides making specific recommendations the report emphasized that the high cost of the city 's judicial system is largely due to the mandatory legislation passed year after year by the Legislature at Albany , adding to court costs without the city 's consent and compell1 ling the city government to appropriate the additional funds involved . It asserted that " the barrier of mandatory legislation should be smashed " and that " the City of New York is entitled to a greater degree of ' home rule ' in its courts , in the form at least of equal conI trot with the judges of the staffing of the various courts and the fixation of the salaries of the court officers and employes . " The court systems studied included the Supreme Court in the First Judicial District , which covers New York and Bronx Counties ; five Surrogate 's Courts , the Court of General Sessions , four county courts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Municipal Court , the City Court and the Domestic Relations Court . Mr. Osborn explained that the Supreme Courts in the . Second Judicial District , covering Kings , Queens and Richmond Counties , were not included in the survey be- I cause the investigating staff was " unable to secure access to thesel courts . " Urging the establishment of ail central body charged with the efficient administration of the city 's judicial system , the report said : " It is true that such a body might not concern itself with each judge and employe , but it should appointl an administrative judge in each court of any size to supervise the local work . The judges and em- ployes , without exception , should be brought into a unified system . " A judge in a snanll court may be an efficient administrator , but in the larger courts judicial work too often precludes administrative duties . Centralized control is necessary in the courts of many parts . " Particularly , it is important to bring employes working as part of the judicial machine under its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solely to the direction of those responsible for operating the courts . The proposal for a general regulatory system is not a reflection on the efficient judge or employe . " The judicial machine in the City of New York has become cumbersome and intricate . This condition has obstructed the administration of justice and subjected the community to unnecessary expense . Centralized administrative authority is wanting . " The work of the courts should be made the subject of continuous study . They are a living and vital part of a constantly changing society and should be more closely attuned to its growing needs . " No organization involving the numbers of persons and the amounts and diverse types of business in the courts can function efficiently without central supervision and regulation . It is not a matter of ability and honesty , but it is a question of ordinary management of many persons and a mass of business . " Where the State- Constitution or a statute prescribes the creation and powers of a particular court , or vests administrative authority in a particular judge or body , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such amendment should be promptly undertaken . Confusion of jurisdiction , overlapping of functions and duplication of work which now persist can not otherwise be remedied . " The report said the proposed central courts building in Manhattan would house the Court of Special Sessions , the Court of General Sessions , the district magistrates ' courts , the district municipal courts , the Domestic Relations Court and the District Attorney of New York County . Where Savings Are Suggested . It broke down the estimated saving as follows : From rentals paid for court accommodations in Manhattan 8138,210 From rentals paid by city departments which might be placed in building now occupied by District Attorney , New York County 122,055 Estimated income to city from taxes on property now tax-exempt due to use by courts 79,723 Saving in personnel , due to consolidation of district magistrates ' courts and of municipal courts , Manhattan 615,888 Saving in cost of operation  --  janitorial and cleaning ; heat , light and power ; ordinary wear and tear , and alteration of one central building , as compared with existing number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Court of General Sessions 78,799 51.197,871 " No effort should be spared to secure the erection of the Central Courts Building , " the report went on . " There may be legislative and legal difficulties , but these are not insurmountable . The proposal is practicable and advantageous . " In December , 1934 , a Central Courts Building Committee was formed under the sponsorship of Justice Finch . Its membership is composed of outstanding leaders of the bench , the bar and numerous city officials . The Central Courts Building Committee should press this proposal to a definite conclusion . Urging a central probation bureau for the entire group of criminal courts in the city , the report said eight independent probation departments of bureaus now are maintained in the city , employing more than 350 persons at an annual cost of more than $800,000 . Pointing out that the plan proposed to centralize the district magistrates ' and municipal courts , the report said this had been advocated for several years by judges , bar associations , lawyers ' and civic organizations as a needed step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The present decentralized courts require maintenance of separate buildings with court detention cells and all the necessary staffs of court attendants and other employes , the report remarked . In recommending the consolidation of the Court of Special Sessions and the magistrates ' courts , the report said : " This should bring about a more effective and economical administration of the criminal law in so far as it affects the handling of minor crimes . In a consolidated court appeals could be taken to an Appellate Term composed of three magistrates or justices , according to the title used , if the proposed consolidation is effected . " The two courts in 1935 employ a total of 621 persons at an annual cost to the city of more than $1,900,000 . " While the benefits of economy from such consolidation are important considerations , the intangible advantages to the public can not be stressed too strongly . These include a better distribution of work , the elimination of existing duplicated procedure and the operation of a better coordinated system in a single court of inferior criminal jurisdiction . " Conceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the salaries of its employes are reasonable for the work performed , the report held that the division of judicial work between this court and the magistrates ' courts was not logical , and that a single court of inferior criminal jurisdiction would accomplish much better results at less cost to the city . The report pointed out duplication and overlapping and emphasized that the annual reports of the Special Sessions Court showed that the business transacted kept the staff of employes busy only part of each working day . The report pointed out that the City Court is costing the city this year $942,000 for twenty-two justices and 194 regular employes . It emphasized that twenty-two secretaries of justices drew salaries totaling $77,000 a year , as an example of overstaffing in the City Court . Observing that the court deals with civil cases involving not more than $3,000 and is limited in the main to the disposition of cases that belong to the Municipal Court , the report noted that the City Court is written into the State Constitution . " The administration of civil justice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be greatly simplified if the City Court were abolished by amendment of the State Constitution . Legislative enactment should increase the jurisdiction of the Municipal Court to include actions involving not more than $2,000 . The remaining matters should be transferred from the City Court to the Supreme Court . " There is no reason for retainin , , the secretaries to justices on the payroll , as they perform only routine secretarial duties and act as reception clerks . If the need of the position were real it would require the services of a lawyer , and not necessarily one lawyer for each justice of the City Court . " Would Abolish Offices . The report said the office of Commissioner of Records in the City Court , established by the Legislature in 1931 , had made little progress in its work of caring for old records . It urged that the Legislature abolish the office . Advocatingabolition by legislative enactment of the post of Commissioner of Records in the Surrogates ' Court of New York County , the report said : " This office is a striking instance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for vague purposes which multiply costs to the city . Under the mandatory law establishing this office , the city must pay without protest salaries amounting to $80,000 a year . All the work of preserving records can be done by the regular staff in the Surrogates ' Court . " Urging the reconsolidation of the County Court , Surrogates ' Court and the City Court in Richmond County , the report said the replacing of one court by these three courts in 1932 , after legislative enactment and action by the Board of Aldermen , had increased costs to the city from $58,000 to $137,000 a year . Formerly the County Court handled criminal , surrogate and civil matters . The report continued : " Richmond County , with a population of approximately 160,000 , does not require the services of separate courts . The county judge in Richmond should be empowered to act as surrogate . Until the City Court may be abolished and the municipal court takes over part of its jurisdiction , the county judge should perform the duties of the City Court justice in Richmond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts could be reduced considerably by the establishment of a system of small fines for minor offenses . Under this system an offender would receive a summons and be notified that at his option he could pay a fine fixed by schedule before the day when the st.mmons was returnable . If he paid , he might disregard the summons . If not , the summons still would be effective . The report said this system would relieve congestion in the traffic courts . Grading of Clerks Suggested . Recommending substitution of graded clerks for high - salaried clerks as a future policy , the report said there are 164 justices ' clerks , clerks of judges , secretaries of justices , clerks of surrogates and confidential clerks of judges , all in the exempt class of the civil service and drawing an annual salary total of $635,545 . In urging the elimination of lunacy commissions in the criminal courts , now costing the city $125 , - 000 a year , the report suggested repeal of the section of the criminal code under which they are appointed . The commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of his or her duties . It entered this information on separate cards , and is prepared to submit it to the budget director and the Municipal Civil Service Commission in its effort to bring about the proposed reclassification of positions and salaries .
