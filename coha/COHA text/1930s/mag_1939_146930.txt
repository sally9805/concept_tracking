In Month I of War II U. S. production jumped from 102% of the 1923-25 average to 110 . Beginning of Month II , production was around 115 , headed for the 1937 peak of 118 . Guarantee of its getting there is the fact that the output of U. S. industry is sold out until the end of the year , that most industries have stopped booking orders , are concentrating on making deliveries . <P> Steel . Typical of industries no longer making sales last week was Steel , whose customers will be amply stocked against any possible famine if only they can get delivery on orders already placed . Chief worry of the industry right now is how to keep the operating rate ( last week : 87.5% , this week 88.6% ; buying by consumers took up about 70% ) above 85% of nominal capacity without dangerously deferring repairs , cracking up expensive new machinery , running shaky old machinery into the ground . Even small marginal companies like Tycoon J. H. Hillman Jr . ' s Pittsburgh Steel Co. were defying the rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repair , were actually smelting ingots at better than 100% of nominal capacity . Bethlehem 's battery of 30 old and new furnaces at Buffalo is now working at 100% for the first time in Bethlehem 's history . Steel 's ( mostly Big Steel 's ) last reserve of obsolescent capacity in Chicago and Pittsburgh waited to limp into action . When these furnaces are blown in to work once every five or ten years , steelmen prepare for overproduction and shutdown . <P> Pig &; Scrap . Fourth quarter steel earnings will not be as lush as production because sheets will be going at June 's cut prices until Jan. 1 . And there is a menacing squeeze in raw materials . September pig iron production rose only 12% because blast furnaces for making pig iron are in worse shape than furnaces for smelting steel ingots . Quick to profit from the scarcity of pig ( price $22.50 ) have been the railroads and other sellers of its rival raw material , scrap , who have put the price up to $26 a ton ( Aug. 31 price : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bundles of scrapped sheets which they must re-roll to strict specifications to sell for only $7 to $8 more . Rail mills are buying scrap to go into rail selling for only $14 more . Small steel companies , buying nearly all their scrap have already passed $5 of this scrap advance on to their customers , are unable to get enough raw material to fill orders even at this advanced price . Scrap is one material Europe has actually bought heavily .
