txt Excerpts From Letters on Many Subjects Webster 's Work in Goshen Lovely Goshen , where the trotting horse is king , has a greater national glory , wide-winged over a cultural world . Here it might be said our school book and public school system were founded and our language standardized by a Yale graduate , 24 years old , the famous Noah Webster , who also in 1786-87 , as a lecturer for the Constitutional Convention , urged the State Legislature to adopt the Federal Constitution with which he and his cousin , Pelatiah Webster . had so much to do . In 1782 he came to Goshen and established " a select classical school , fees 6 to 9 shillings a week . " And speaking of the horse , be it said that Webster , like Washington , was among America 's best and furthest riding horsemen . Goshen is aureoled with the national Webster school saga , and I would like to see a cultural memorial revived there. ? JOHN STUART THOMSON , Jersey City , N. J.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
