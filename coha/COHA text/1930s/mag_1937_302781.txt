&gt; Soviet Justice caught up last week with eleven phonograph record speculators , the suddenly notorious " SPECTOR AND MYZNIKOV AND THEIR ACCOMPLICES , " as Moscow called them . Spector &; Myznikov , well knowing that the State Music Stores have nothing like enough phonograph records to supply the wants of Moscow 's phonograph addicts , neglected to stay away from those stores as the State desires patriots to do in order that some records may always be " offered for sale " and appearances kept up . <P> When daring Spector &; Myznikov went so far as to enter the stores singly and have relatives and friends do the same and insist on buying records , alert Stalin Secret Police were soon on the miscreants ' trail . They were accused in court last week of reselling their phonograph records privately to more timid Moscow music lovers who make their purchases in the safety of dark alleys rather than in the State Music Stores . The court sentenced Spector &; Myznikov to seven years each in jail , gave their accomplice 's from six to five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some $30,000,000 of machines to the comrade who was then Soviet State Buyer No. 1 , long-jawed Valery Ivanovich Mezhlauk . Since 1932 he has been Soviet State Planner No. 1 , and his latest Five-Year Plan is especially behind schedule in Heavy Industry . Last week J. Stalin made the now necessarily friendly move of having Buyer-Planner Mezhlauk appointed to replace the late Grigoriy Konstantinovich Orclzhonikidze , as Commissar for Heavy Industry . Russia 's planners and Russia 's performers , inevitably , blame each other for Five-Year Plan setbacks and it is no bed of roses in which long-jawed Mezhlauk was planted . <P> &gt; In recent weeks Leon Trotsky has begun taking Walter Duranty repeatedly to task as a " dilettante journalist with a more or less Left slant . " Last week Trotskyists pointed to a New York Times cable on new U. S. Ambassador Joseph E. Davies in which Mr. Duranty wrote : " Unlike most diplomats here , Mr. Davies is profoundly interested in industrial development as a result of his own work before and during the World War . To Soviet officials , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is unexpected , and they have asked him to obtain from Washington his " own reports , drawn up from 1911 to 1917 , on the metallurgical and coal industries of the United States , and the costs of those industries in wartime . <P> " Mr. Davies has now met either officially or socially all the important Soviet leaders , except Joseph Stalin , and is said to have won top marks in all directions . " <P> Top-marked Ambassador Davies and Daughter Emlen start this week on a quick swing in their private car around industrial centres within 600 miles of Moscow . Mrs. Davies remains in Moscow as she is " not interested . To avoid indigestion , the Ambassador has informed local Soviet authorities that they will not eat outside their car , thus saving their Russian hosts the cost of local banquets for the U. S. Ambassador . He will feed as many local bigwigs as possible , also five U. S. correspondents . Next the Davieses will hurry to Manhattan , embark on their yacht for the Coronation ( see p. 19 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yacht ready for use at all times .
