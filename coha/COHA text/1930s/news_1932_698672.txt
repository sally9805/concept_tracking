txt GUESSING IN CONGRESS . Estimates of the Popular Will Ace Not Always Correct . To the Editor of The New York Times : Some of your correspondents wax amusingly wroth because our representatives vote on the popular side on tax and other issues . How else should they vote ' This is supposed to be a representative government , and the whole duty of the men we elect by popular majority vote is to act as nearly as possible upon the views of those they represent . True , it is mostly a guessing contest , and they sometimes guess wrong . They presumably guessed wrong when they attempted to make the country dry . They did most certainly not guess wrong when they killed the sales tax . Theoretically the sales tax is excellent , and in such things as gasoline and the like it works out very well . But in all other matters it simply gives the merchant an opportunity to raise his prices . The price becomes " tax included , " and is figured out in nice , clean round numbers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Uncle Sam , 3 extra cents for the seller . Let our representatives represent us ! And please urge the Republicans and Democrats to give us a platform of the simplest sort , so that , in voting for one thing of which we approve , we are not forced to vote for some things of which we thoroughly disapprove . A VOTER . New York , March 28 , 1932.
