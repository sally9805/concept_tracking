Three weeks ago Publisher Charles C. Thomas of Springfield , Ill. issued 1,500 copies of a small monograph called The Lung by Anatomist William Snow Miller of the University of Wisconsin . Price was $7.50 . The issue was sold out in a fortnight and last week zealous doctors offered as high as $50 for a copy . This rare situation in the history of medical publishing was attributable to the fact that in the history of medicine there had never before appeared so thoroughgoing a study of the human lung . Dr. Miller 's 20g-page monograph-including an affectionate dedication to his wife who was once his student-took its place overnight beside such classics as William Harvey 's Motion of the Heart &; Blood , Rudolf Virchow 's Cellular Pathology . Some well and lesser known facts covered by The Lung : <P> The lungs are two irregular conical shaped organs occupying the chest . At birth and for three weeks thereafter they are white . Gradually they darken to yellowish grey or reddish grey in the adult . People who live in smoky cities like St. Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with black and blue lines from particles of soot . Coal miners ' lungs are black , copper miners ' are blue . <P> Men 's lungs are bigger than women 's . Their weights range from 2 lb. ( women ) to 3 lb. ( men ) . At full inspiration the lungs contain about 5 qt. of air . At every normal breath 1 pt. of air goes in &; out of the lungs . <P> Air enters each lung through a bronchus , which branches from the windpipe ( trachea ) . A bronchus subdivides successively into bronchioles , air ducts ( ductuli alveolares ) , air pockets ( atria ) , lobules . Lobules bulge with many air sacs ( acini ) which look like clusters of grapes . Walls of the lobules adjoin walls of capillaries in which the pulmonary veins and pulmonary arteries terminate . The pulmonary arteries bring dark blood loaded with carbon dioxide from the body 's tissues to the lobules . The lobules treat the blood with fresh oxygen , leaving it pure and crimson . <P> Bronchial pneumonia results from inflammation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than lobar pneumonia which clogs the lobules and prevents carbon dioxide from getting out of the blood , oxygen from getting in . <P> Anatomists and physicians have known a good deal of all this since 1628 , when William Harvey published his De Motu Cordis . But enough remained unknown to cause Dr. Miller 47 years of research . It was he who discovered the lungs ' atria . He proved that the significant unit of lung architecture is the lobule . He systematized the whole lung anatomy , rationalized its physiology . He anatomized the tubercle of Ghon , the spot in the lung from which certain cases of pulmonary tuberculosis develop in children . He guided a former assistant , Professor Olof Larsell of the University of Oregon , in mapping the nerves of the lungs . Despite all this , Dr. Miller humbly and urgently begins his monograph : " There remain many problems to be solved . " For instance , does oxygen diffuse directly into the blood stream , or do the lungs first do something to oxygen to make it fit for the blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cause diseases like measles ?
