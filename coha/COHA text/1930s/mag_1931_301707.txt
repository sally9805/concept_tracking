When about two and a half years ago Florida 's banking structure was toppling , a Strong Man came to save it . He was Alfred Irne du Pont , stormiest of the great Wilmington family . Last week he was still continuing Florida 's financial salvage . <P> Alfred Irne du Pont is 67 , has one eye and an irascible nature . His 500-acre estate ( " Nemours " ) near Wilmington is guarded by a high , barbaric wall . Firmly cemented in its top are great jagged pieces of glass . The gates are made of iron grillwork backed with steel sheeting . No unwelcome eye may look at " Nemours , " no unwelcome feet tread its lawns . <P> In 1902 when the du Pont company was celebrating its centennial , the death of Eugene du Pont had left the family 's holdings at their lowest ebb . Alfred brought together his cousins Senator Thomas Coleman du Pont and Pierre Samuel du Pont , acquired $12,000,000 worth of stock and a good grip on the company . In 1915 Senator du Pont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth $56,000,000 ) to Pierre Samuel du Pont &; associates . Alfred , not one of the associates , declared war . There followed a cousinly battle of giants , du Pont against du Pont for great E.I. du Pont de Nemours &; Co . The war had banking ramifications , Alfred obtaining control of Delaware Trust Co. and with it great power in Wilmington . It had its political aspects , Alfred fighting the late Colonel Henry Algernon du Pont in State politics and Senator Thomas Coleman du Pont fighting Alfred . It had its ramifications in the company , where Alfred , William and Francis du Pont were ousted from executive positions by a 55% vote of stock . It even was carried on socially , for Alfred divorced his wife ( a cousin ) , tried to say her youngest child was not his , brought upon himself du Pont wrath . Later he married the former wife of an employe , increased the family ire . <P> Aging Alfred now spends most of his time in Florida . He became a newsworthy figure again last year when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is an able engineer , has invented many a powder machine . He is an able musician , likes a violin . Once he organized and conducted a band at the powder-works , composed stirring marches . The Marine Band recently tried to get copies of them but found he has given up music , destroyed his manuscripts . His hobby now is his yacht Alicia ( named for his second wife ) , designed by him ; his pet is a much pampered mongrel dog . <P> To Florida he brought new , sound banks , all with the name Florida National . Last week in Miami the newest one of these began business with $1,250,000 deposited , a good half million more than any other bank in the State has ever received on its first day . Other du Pont banks ( all controlled by his Almours Corp. ) are in Jacksonville , Orlando , St. Petersburg , Bartow , Lakeland . Applications are pending for Daytona , De Land and Tampa .               @ @ @ @ @ @
