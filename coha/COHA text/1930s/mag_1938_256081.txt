The President of the United States last week enjoyed himself in the role of country squire at Hyde Park . He gave out one formal statement , expressing his hopes that the new Wages &; Hours law would work , and that employers doing intrastate business would comply with its spirit . For the rest he drove in his car through the woodland roads of his estate , watching his trees grow , and enjoyed the squirely duty of receiving visitors . No ordinary squire , he naturally had callers of no ordinary distinction . <P> His most eminent caller was Ambassador to France ' ' Bill " Bullitt , one of the most trusted of his foreign emissaries . Unlike other Presidents , who frequently filled diplomatic posts to repay political debts to party fat-cats whom they were glad to have out of the way , Franklin Roosevelt has stationed two of his favored advisers , Joe Kennedy and Bill Bullitt , in important embassies abroad . Last week Mr. Kennedy in London advised Democracies and Dictators to learn to get on together in the same world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced landing two days before in the airplane of Governor Earle of Pennsylvania , the perennial rumor of a War debt settlement with France revived . Europe 's affairs were doubtless a leading topic for discussion . The pair went motoring , talked long and privately while picnic-lunching at the roadside . <P> &gt;Governor Lehman of New York came for lunch and Franklin Roosevelt 's understood purpose was to get his sore-tried friend to whoop up the New Deal in his campaign for reelection . Mr. Lehman , unforgetting foe of the Court Plan , returned to his stump with kind words for Franklin Roosevelt but no New Deal honey on his tongue . <P> &gt;Senator Wagner of New York came to discuss the prospect of Palestine being closed to outcast Jews as a homeland . President Roosevelt promised to high-pressure England . Worrying Senator Wagner also was the sudden strength of Republican John Lord O'Brian 's campaign against him for reelection . He sought and received the full-blast backing of the New Deal publicity machine . <P> &gt;In My Day , some months ago , Mrs. Roosevelt casually remarked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of shoes which " make standing for hours a pleasure . " After investigating , the radio MARCH OF TIME re-enacted on the air her White House fitting by the shoe 's inventor , 54-year-old , Syrian-born Cobbler James Fikany . Last week , in Rochester , N. Y. , Cobbler Fikany acknowledged the happy result . Deluged with orders from the U. S. , Canada and England , he proudly signed articles for a $250,000 corporation . His backers hoped to expand the little Fikany business into an enterprise for Rochester 's 2,500 unemployed shoe workers . <P> Hardly responsible was Popularizer Roosevelt for a less fortunate innovation in Green Bay , Wis . So interseted ina lecture she was giving were two women who collected admissions at the door that they welcomed the offer of two unidentified men to take over their duties , returned to find the men had walked off with the evening 's receipts , which Mrs. Roosevelt had intended for charity .
