Congressionally speaking , few U. S. industries are as strong as the puny U. S. shipbuilding industry , which employed only 55,000 men ( in construction ) in 1929 , only 65,000 last July . No U. S. industry , big or little , has been so welcome in Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's Washington as shipbuilding . None has sucked so well at the public tit . But last week shipbuilding was threatened with political orphanage . For the sea-loving President and his Neutrality Senators appeared to be compromising with land-loving William Borah and his Neutrality Senators on Cash- &-Carry.; This would force Europe 's belligerents to come and get whatever Congress will let them buy-in their own ships . And this , in turn , would obsolete the up- &-coming; U. S. Maritime Commission and its program of rebuilding the merchant marine to handle the foreign trade of the U. S. <P> Nor was there much chance that the Allies would wish to buy ships useless to the U. S. At the outbreak of World War I , 34,825,000 tons of shipping were on the seas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons lost in the War , scrapped . But at the outbreak of World <P> War II , 68,000,000 tons are already in the water-of which the British Empire owns 21,000,000 tons and can draw on at least 30,000,000 tons more . <P> But one big merchant-navy man who was not bothered by all this was Maritime Commission Chairman-Admiral Emory Scott Land . On the chance that any time within the next two years Congress might want many more merchantmen than the U. S. now has , particularly merchantmen convertible into aircraft carriers and other handy things to have around in an emergency , Chairman-Admiral Land meant to have ships on hand . His answer to last week 's shipbuilding jitters : to shovel out orders for seven ships more to the overworked yards which are currently building merchantmen.
