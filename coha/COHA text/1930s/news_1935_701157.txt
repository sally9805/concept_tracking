txt Administration forces in the House today rejected twenty-five major and minor amendments to the Social Security Bill and the Democratic managers declared that the measure had weathered the worst storm it would encounter in the House . Both radical and conservative changes were voted down . In rapid succession , the House rejected the Townsend plan , the Lundeen bill , the Scrugham-Greenway amendment , the " share-the-wealth " proposal by Representative Truax of Ohio , Republican proposals to increase old-age pensions from $30 to $40 a month and to strike out the compulsory old-age annuities , as well as a host of minor suggested changes . Votes on the more important amendments were : Townsend Plan  --  Defeated 266 to 56 . Lundeen Bill  --  Rejected 204 to 52 . Scrugham-Greenway Amendment ? Failed , 165 to 87 . Treadway Amendment Raising Top Limit of Old-Age Pensions From $30 to $40 a month  --  Rejected 144 to 80 . Townsend Hits " Pauper Pensions . " The Truax share - the - wealth amendment was shouted down without even a standing vote . The proposal read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this act shall be obtained by a capital tax levy on all individual fortunes of $1,000,000 and all inheritances , gifts and individual and corporation incomes of $5,000 a year and over . " When the House adjourned today old-age pensions and compulsory old-age annuities , contained in Titles I and II , had been completed on second reading , and Speaker Byrns and Representative Snell , Republican leader , agreed that the measure should be finally passed tomorrow . Dr. F. E. Townsend , author of the plan introduced as a bill by Representative of California , said in a statement made ' on learning of the House action : " Nothing will so crystallize sentiment and be such a tremendous aid to the Townsend plan as the passage of the administration 's socialsecurity pauper pension bill . " It will have the same effect on the nation as a whole as pauper pension bills of some of the States , many of which are characterized as ' anti-suicide pensions . ' " Townsend Plan Is Defended . Representative Monaghan of Montana , who offered the plan as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the administration had left 11,000 , - 000 persons still unemployed , " There is only one way to meet the machine age in this country , " he said , " and that is by the retirement of aged workers , a method to which even the chiselers , the unpatriotic leaders of industry , can not " object . If we take enough men out of industry and drastically cut the hours of labor , these two measures will perform the task of putting men back to work . " Representative Mott of Oregon declared that when 30,000,000 people had said by petition that they wanted something even more drastic , " you can not ridicule or laugh this thing out of existence . " He held that the only valid objection to the Townsend plan was the taxation feature . Representative Truax of Ohio defended the proposal , but moved to expand it with a provision that to finance the plan a capital tax be levied on all income over $5,000 a year . The House first shouted down the latter supplementary amend- ment and then rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 56 , was nd surprise , Speaker Byrns having predicted that not more than ' 60 votes would be cast for it . Next came the Greenway-Scrugham amendment , providing for Federal grants to States for old-age assistance on the basis of $5 of Federal contribution for each $1 by the States and setting $25 as the minimum Federal monthly contribution to the indigent over 60 . Greenway Proposal Leads All Representative Isabella Green ; way said that under the adminIstration 's bill the government would not be called upon to con ; tribute anything unless the States ; recognized their responsibility , and even in that event it would only match the State contribution. , " We are dealing here with people who are helpless , " she said . " We are considering not a distribution of wealth , but a distribution of , necessity , Many States will have to amend their Constitutions to qualify for Federal aid under the pending bill . Who will say that persons over 60 are able to help themselves when we know that employment is denied those over 45 ? " Representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to increase from $30 to $45 the monthly amount paid the indigent aged . Representative McCormack of Massachusetts , a member of the Ways and Means Committee , opposed both liberaliting proposals . He predicted that if the government undertook responsibility which was properly that of the States , a disintegration of our dual system of government would result . The House then shouted down the Ekwall proposal and , by a standing vote , rejected the Scrugham-Greenway amendment . The vote , 165 to 187 , represented the strongest support for any amendment to the bill . Lundeen Plan Sharply Debated . Representative Connery of Massachusetts now brought up the Lundeen bill , proposed as a substitute for the administration 's measure . It called for higher income and inheritance taxes to raise some $8,000,000,000 annually to pay the unemployed a minimum of $10 a week , plus ari additional $3 for each dependent , with the objective of redistributing wealth . Mr. Connery urged that " the big money men " of the country be taxed to support the unemployed The income and excise taxes provided in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor , he said , whereas the Lundeen bill would place the burden " where it belonged " and , at the same time , prevent exploitation , by manufacturers , of the poor . Representatives Marcantonie of New York and Truax supported the Lundeen plan . The former described the excise and income taxes imposed by the administration bill as a disguised sales tax , which had been rejected by the House on a previous occasion after a speech by Chairman Doughton of the Ways and Means Committee . Mr. Doughton replied that he would make the same speech again today if conditions were the same . He denied , ' however , that the taxes here imposed were in any sense a sales tax . " Wily not tax the rich ? " shouted Representative Lundeen . " We will tax the rich at the proper time and in the proper way , Mr. Doughton shouted back . " In fact , we are doing so today . There Iare Federal taxes , State taxes , county taxes , municipal taxes and other taxes . We tax ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have taxes for the living and taxes for the dead . And if that ai n't taxin ' ' em , I do n't know what is , " When the vote against the Lundeen substitute , 204 to 52 , was announced , Mr. Connery demanded a teller vote , which ended the argument on the tally of 158 to 40 . The first Republican effort came ; early in the debate . Representative Treadway , ranking minority member of the Ways and Means Committee , offered an amendment to increase the top limit of the old age pensions from $30 to $40 , shared equally by the Federal and State governments . His amendment also would have increased the initial appropriation from $49,750,000 to $69 , - 750,000 . Holds Maximum Inadequate . He said that the $30 maximum provided for in the bill was insufficient to provide the aged with the " reasonable subsistence compatible with decency and health " for which the measure calls . He was supported by Representative Jenkins of Ohio , who said the amendment would permit rich States to do better for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon " to put up another nickel . " " Beware of the Greeks bearing gifts , " said Representative Cooper , of Tennessee in opposing the amendment . " The only purpose of the amendment is to try to disrupt the President 's social security program . " He asserted that the bill , as it stood , permitted the most liberal old-age pensions of any country in the world , and pensions more liberal than any of the twenty-nine States now having old-age pension laws . Only New York and Massachusetts , he said , had laws enabling them to appropriate more than $15 a month as their share . The Treadway amendment was then defeated by a teller vote of 80 to 144 . Several amendments were offered by Representatives from Arkansas and Mississippi , attempting to diminish the share the State would ' have to bear in paying old-age pen-1 sions , but all were rejected . Representative Knutson of Minnesota proposed to raise the initial appropriation to $99,500,000 instead ; of $49,750,000 , to enable the pensions to be paid to persons over sixty instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of $30 . His amendment was defeated ' by acclamation . Immediate Payments Beaten . Amendments proposed by Repre- ' sentatives Martin of Colorado and Nichols of Oklahoma would require that the $15 monthly contribution by the government for immediate old-age assistance be advanced , regardless of whether a State plan of contribution had been presented and approved by the Social Security Board . The Martin proposal ' would have continued Federal contributions in the absence of a State plan until July , 1937 , but that by Mr. Nichols stated simply that , in the absence of a State plan , the federation contributions were to . be made as though a State plan had been offered and approved . The Martin amendment was voted down , 108 to 29 , and that of Mr. Nichols by 126 to 47 . In rapid succession the House , without debate , then voted down amendments by Representatives McClellan of Arkansas , Southoff of Wisconsin and Mott of Oregon , which would increase the $9,000,000 appropriation for immediate old-age assistance to $450,000,000 and $150 , - 000,000 , respectively , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such assistance from 65 to 60 years , The former two proposals were shouted down , and the Mott proposal lost by a standing division of 126 to 13 . With the first title of the bill adopted , Representative Vinson of Kentucky toffered the committee Ilarnendmen to the second title in connection with the reserve fund . Representative Kenney of New Jersey took advantage of the opportunity to speak after recognition had been refused him all day . Members began to smile when he obtained the floor , knowing that he would eventually come around to his scheme for a national lottery to raise funds for any and ' all governmental expenditures . He did and was satisfied after having placed in the record the fact that New Jersey paid $90,000,000 annually to the Federal Treasury in taxes and received only $52,000,000 in return . Treadway Criticizes Wallace . Mr. Treadway then began his assault on Title 2 , which sets up a system of compulsory annuity contributions , by moving to strike out the entire title . After a perfunctory condemnation of this section he directed his ire at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the efficiency of New England industry . He charged that Secretary Wallace had inveighed against the morality of New England citizens , and said he would not " yield supinely to his orders and insults . " Reminded several times by the presiding officer that he must confine his remarks to the motion to strike out Title 2 , Mr. Treadway returned to the proposed old-age annuity system . " Its whole purpose is to tax industry , and that it will eventually do , to the extent of $1,877,000,000 a year , " he contended . He was supported by Representative Reed of New York in the contention that the second title of the bill would be found unconstitutional , Representative Lewis of Maryland , co-author of the administration 's bill , took the floor to reply to Mr. Treadway 's assertion that no member of the Ways and Means Committee could say honorably that the 6 per , cent tax for financing the , annuity plan was justifiable . He cited figures to show that $21 , - 215,000 ; 000 of dividend payments had been advanced by industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of accumulated reserves . While conceding that this was entirely proper , Mr. Lewis contended that simple justice demanded that an equal amount ' should have been set aside for the emergency in which the laboring man was eventually to find-himself.
