In the gaslit era before cinema and radio , St. Nicholas was the No. 1 U. S. magazine for young people . Like the old quarry where swimming was forbidden , like the first ice on the pond in winter , it was an essential part of childhood-a storehouse of fruitful articles and hair-raising fiction for adolescents . <P> Many a youth last week had never heard of St. Nicholas , many a grown-up had forgotten it still existed . But alive it was , though senescent . Last week St. Nicholas , 66 years old , withdrew its foot from the grave , took a new lease on life , and went on sale exclusively in 112 F. W. Woolworth stores as a picture magazine for elementary grade-school children . <P> Thus passed into virtual oblivion the St. Nicholas that had nourished some of the major talents of a past generation . To St. Nicholas in 1886 young Richard Harding Davis sold his first story , about football at Princeton . For St. Nicholas Rudyard Kipling wrote Just So Stories , Mark Twain Tom Sawyer Abroad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Lord Fauntleroy . <P> Founded in 1873 by Charles Scribner 's Sons , then taken over by the Century Co. , St. Nicholas began to decline after World War I as children turned to movies , radio , comic strips , and children 's tastes grew steadily more sophisticated . To hold its market St. Nicholas lowered its age appeal year by year . Still circulation dropped : from a onetime high of around 100,000 it was down to less than 25,000 last year . <P> In 1934 St. Nicholas passed into the hands of stocky , dynamic President Roy Walker of Educational Publishing Corp . Publisher Walker wanted it as a classroom adjunct to The Grade Teacher , trade journal for educators . Then last year Woolworth 's began to look around for new magazines to replace the 5- &-10; store Tower Group , which had just sunk in a morass of financial trouble and scandal . <P> Seven Tower magazines ( devoted to movies and radio , home and children , love and mystery ) had shared a total circulation of some 900,000 copies before a Federal Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defraud . ( Case is still pending . ) One of the best had been Tiny Tower for children , with around 150,000 readers . <P> As a successor to Tiny Tower , St. Nicholas went into Woolworth stores last week . Its price was cut from 25 to 10 . It sported a bright two-color format like Tiny Tower 's . Oldtime readers of St. Nicholas would never have recognized its pages , filled with crude , bold drawings of camels and hippopotamuses and monkeys , pictures to be cut out and mounted , nursery fables in the style of Thornton Burgess . <P> Sole remaining feature of the old magazine is the St. Nicholas League , a department for child contributors . Started in 1900 , the League published early stories , poems and drawings by Robert Benchley , Stephen Vincent Bent , Robert Edmond Jones , Edna St. Vincent Millay.
