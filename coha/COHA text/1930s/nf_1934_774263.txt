APPENDIX I Mentioned last Year my design to plant the Seeds of Russia Water Melons and Cotton , the first produced Melons remarkably good and large , weighing more than fifteen Pounds : the Cotton came up but was long retarded by the Drowth , Podded , but were not Ripe . I fear our Summers are not sufficient to bring that to Maturity . Of the several sorts of Earth which I put upon my Land last Year as Manure , none of them did well but only the Earth of the dreined Land ; this in Corn and Grass was near equal to Yard Dung . I understand that some having tried Steeping Corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to be wondred at , since instead of Steeping it five or six Days , they soaked it only twenty four Hours . In the former Essay , what I proposed for this Years Entertainment as curious and useful , was that profitable Husbandry performed by the Drill Plough ; which is an Engine by which Wheat , Pease , Turneps , or what you will , are planted at a proper distance , a fit depth , and covered all at once and with great speed : This sort of Husbandry is greatly Improved and much Practised since it was first invented by the ingenious Mr. Tull . John Hubbard Esq ; of New-Haven , who besides his other useful Qualifications , is of a mechanical Genius , upon whom I depended for help to make a Drill Plough ; but he being in an ill State of Health I was deprived of that necessary assistance .

THE Foundation of a Settlement in New-England , was not laid otherwise than at a great Expence of Lives and Estate . Almost half the Planters Died soon after their Arrival , of such Distempers , which had probably been contracted by Hunger , Cold and other Hardships to which they had been exposed . This , and the following Transmigrations , the Historians of those Times inform us , Cost for the Transporting Inhabitants , Ninety Five Thousand Pounds Sterling ; For bringing over Live Stock , Horses , Neat Cattle , Sheep , and Goats , Twenty Thousand Pounds : For Provisions , until it could be Raised in the Country for their Subsistance , Forty Five Thousand Pounds more ; which Reduced to our Currency makes a prodigious Sum . They having laid for us a good Foundation , and left us , their Posterity , Possessed of the Fruits of their Expence and Labour ; we shall be wanting to ourselves , if we fail to Improve , and Manure this great and good Land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Industry which is set before us . The Continuation of this Essay is designed to forward , and promote such Improvement . If the Aboriginal-Natives , the Indian Inhabitants of this Country , did Subsist here in great Numbers when destitute  | of Ploughs , the Labour of the Ox , or any Instrument made of Iron , or any other Metal : It would be to our Dishonour , if from Indolence or want of Application , we do not comfortably Subsist , and advance in our Improvement . It hath been observed by our Writers , that Old-England , in former Times , suffered more frequently and more severely by Famine , than in latter Times . This was not owing to the Inclemency of the Seasons in those distant Times , or to better Seasons in these Days , that there is a greater Plenty . Our English Historians inform us , that there was so great a Famine in the Reign of Edward the Third , that Bread Corn was Sold at Thirteen times more than the usual Price . ' Any remarkable Scarcity is now very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Providence , as the Cause of this difference . i . In those ancient Times England had but little Shipping or Trade : There was then little sent away besides Block-tin and Wool : there being no Market for Corn , Flesh , and other Provisions but what could be found at Home ; there was no Encouragement to Raise it , more than to supply their own Wants : If they did Raise more , it must lie upon their Hands ; There being Yearly but little Corn Sowed , if the Seasons were a little Unfavourable , it was immediately felt ; whereas when a great deal is Planted and Sowed , if there happens Hail , Frost , Blast and Mildew , so as to cut short the Crop , yet there will be sufficient for the Inhabitants . 2 . Another Reason of the difference between the former and latter Times , is this , in these Times there is a greater Variety of Lands under Improvement than formerly ; some Dry Land , some Moist , some Clayey , and some Sandy Ground ; some High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III occupied the throne from 1327 to 1377 . In his reign England suffered severely from both famine and pestilence . The black death which swept over the British Isles about the middle of the fourteenth century was preceded by crop failures and scarcity of food . In many parts of England people were reduced to starvation . The populace , therefore , became easy prey to the ravages of disease .  | The Farmers of the present Age make use of a greater Variety of Grain than formerly . They sow Five and Twenty sorts of Wheat ; many sorts of Grass , many sorts of Roots and Fruits ; the Advantage obtained hereby is very great : The Seasons that ill Suits with one sort of Land , or Grain , may agree well with another : A wet Summer will Suit the dry Land , and dry Seasons agree with the low moist Land ; when one fails another hits . A Variety of Grain and Grass may be fitted to that sort of Land to which in its Nature it is thereunto most agreeable . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barley , the Land should be very Strong ; be made Mellow , that is reduced to a great degree of Fineness ; These being the two necessary Properties for Barley Ground , I tho't that certainly the Dreined Land , which would produce Eighty Bushels of Indian Corn to the Acre , and the Ground very Fine and Mellow , would not fail to produce great Crops of Barley . I made a Trial ; but it proved otherwise than was expected ; the Produce was small and poor : Whereas the same Land afforded very large Flax , at which I much wondered , till I met with an Old English Rhyming Proverb , Viz. To have great Crops of Flax , and Barley . Sow Flax in the Mire , Sow Barley in the Fire . By Sowing in the Fire , we are to understand that Barley must be Sowed in Land well heated with Dung , Lime , or Ashes , or other hot Manure . I suppose that if the afore-mentioned Land had been Dunged , and thereby Warmed , it might have yielded much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great Variety of sorts of Grain , not as yet commonly in Use among us . From what Experience I have had of it , I would Recom-  | mend Millet ; Some of this Seed was sent to me under the Name of East-India Wheat : I soon discovered that it was no Species of Wheat , but that it was Millet . It is a small Grain of a yellowish Colour , and of the bigness of Turnip or Cabbage Seed : it was anciently used as Bread-Corn , as we may see in Ezek. 4. 9 . I tried a little of it , exactly measuring the Ground and Product ; made a Computation , and found that although the Land was Poor , yet it yielded at the Rate of Thirty Two Bushels to the Acre . I have been told , that strong Land will produce Fifty or Sixty Bushels to the Acre : It may be Sowed in the Spring , or in June : It is but a mean sort of Grain , yet it will save better . The sore Drought in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put me upon Thoughts of a Supply of Fodder when Clover fails ; pursuant hereunto I Ploughed up some Flax-ground , in July Sowed Millet Seed the Twenty Sixth Day , it came up , but much Flax came up with it , render 'd it unfit for Mowing , as I designed : I should have Ploughed up Oat Stubble instead of Flax Ground . If the scattered Oats had grown up , it would have helped the Crop when it came to be Mowed , rather than obstructed it . The Millet being thus incumbred and choaked with the Flax , I let it stand for Feeding ; I put a Cow into the same Field to Fat , and observed that although there was good Rowen of Spire Grass , and while White Clover , the Cow neglected that , and would feed constantly upon the Millet till that was all spent before she would eat the Grass ; by which I was assured that it was good Feed . Although the Seed be small , yet it puts up a large strong Stalk , bigger than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leaves like Indian-Corn at Moulding , or Hilling Time : so that it looks likely that if Mowed Green , it will make good  | Fodder , which may be an help to those who foresee they are likely to want Hay . If you Sow it so Early as to have a Crop of Grain , and it stands till the Seed be Ripe , yet the Straw will be good . There is one advantage attending this Grain , that a little Seed is sufficient ; Two or Three Quarts will Seed an Acre . It is probable that when it is Sowed only for Pasture , or Mowing it will be best to Sow it thicker than when it is Sowed for a Crop of Grain . I gave a little of the Seed to a Man that hath but little Meadow ; He Sowed it last Spring , yet notwithstanding the Drought , he had a good Yield : It bears the Drought as well as Wheat . The Man is so well pleased with it , and thinks it will be such an help to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he raised . I scattered a few Seeds in the Driened Land , have reason to think it will Prosper well in such Land . Although it may do to Sow it Late , yet the last Years Experience makes it Evident , that Sowing in the Spring is best if you design a Crop of Grain . It is a Grain that will serve to feed the Poultry , and when ground to Meal serve for the Swine ; nay , I have known the Time when we should have apply 'd it for Human Sustenance . It is a Summer Grain , and therefore not Exposed to be Killed with the Winter , as it frequently happens to Wheat and Rye : Nor have I yet observed it subject to Blast or Mildew : For these Reasons it may be of Advantage to Encourage its Propagation . As Wheat is justly Termed the Golden Grain , and as we have but few Sorts of it among us , it may be of Advantage to Incourage a greater Variety , and especially of Summer Wheat , since we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fall by Wheat-lice , and in the Winter by Frost .  | There is a sort of Summer Wheat brought into Use , not subject to Blast as the sort we had formerly among us . We should Sow both Winter and Summer Wheat ; if one fails , the other may prosper . Mr. Davis of Litchfield , I hear having lately been to Great Britain , has brought over with him Four sorts of Wheat , which was prudently done , it was a Care worthy of Commendation ; I hope with the Seed he hath brought Directions to what sort of Land each Kind is appropriated : For the sorting of Grain to that Kind of Land which is agreable to its Nature , is the great point of Skill requisite and useful to a Farmer . As we have but few Sorts of Wheat , we are under no Advantage to display any Skill that way . I have Sowed Two or Three little pieces of Maslin in my Dreined Land , which came up and set well before Winter ; and now in December looks well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some Maslin that I sowed in Peat Land never came up at all , no more than if it had been Sowed on the Sea Beach ; this Land had been Dreined longer than that where the Corn grows , which is an Evidence that Peat Land requires more Time , and will be Longer before it will be Fertile and bring forth Corn , and Grass , than that Land which is proper Earth . At first I was of the Opinion that Peat Land would never be Fruitful ; but Time and Experience hath Taught me that I was Mistaken : It is slower in coming too than other Land , but afterwards produceth both Corn and Grass as well as any of the Dreined Land . This is what I think I ought in Justice to insert , considering what I have said in a former Essay . What induced me to think that Peat Land would prove totally Barren was this , I observed the Land that had been Dreined some Years , yet would bear nothing . I also took No-  | tice that when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosin : But I find that the Rain and Frost in Time will reduce it to Mould , and then it will be very good land . But to Return . I would propose the Sowing of Cole-wort Seed . This Plant is the Cabbage-kind ; it is sometimes called Cale , and when a Field of it is Sowed with a design that it should run up to Seed till it is Ripe , then it obtains a New Name , and is called Rape ; and it is of this Seed that Rape-Oil is made . The Books of English-Husbandry inform us that when it is Sowed for this purpose , and continued in the Field till fully Ripe , it yields Thirty Two Bushels of Seed to the Acre ; and Sells for Three Shillings per Bushel Sterling . Formerly in the Time when Hartlibb 2 wrote , he saith it Sold for Four Shillings per Bushel . By the Price that it bears in England , it promiseth well to be a profitable piece of Husbandry . I have try 'd it upon Poor Land , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I try 'd a few Seeds on the Dreined Land , and found it to run up to an high Head , and to be full of Seed . There are so many Oyl Mills in this Government making my Computation by the Cost of the last that hath been Built , the whole Number Amounts to the Sum of Ten Thousand Pounds , Old Tenor ; which is a great Estate to lie Dead , as they must do in a great measure this Year , by reason of the scarcity of Flax Seed . If we had a good plenty of Rape Seed , this would keep the Mills going at such a Time , to the Advantage of the Mill Owners , and Benefit of the Public : Yea , in the greatest Plenty of Flax Seed , it may be to our Advantage to raise the Rape Seed , since Flax Seed is constantly in so good Demand to send to Ireland , and fetcheth so good a Price ; Especially when we consider how difficult it is for us to make Returns to Europe . footnote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have Imployment by making Rape Seed Oyl for our own Supply , as also for the West-Indies ; so that we may send away all our Flax Seed , thereby increase our Export , ( which is an important Article ) and it may be our Oyl will be Cheaper than at present when Flax Seed bears so great a Price . When the Linseed Oyl is so Dear as at present , by reason of the high Price of Seed , the Oyl-Men make not more Profit by their Mills , if so much as when the Oyl was much Cheaper : So that here is a great Burthen upon the Country , and a Profit to no Body . Now whether the high Price of Rape Seed in England , be owing to the goodness of the Oyl , or its Yielding more to the Bushel than Flax Seed , I can not tell . Thirty Two Bushels to the Acre , at Three Shillings Sterling , is a fine Profit , of about Fifty Pounds , Old Tenor to the Acre : If it should Yield at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labour about it , we could afford to raise it Cheap , which would abate the Price of Oyl . There is another Advantage to be had by Sowing Coleworts , it would do well for Swine and Cattle . They Sow whole Fields of it in England for that purpose : They Sow some Late and do not Feed it till Winter ; by which means they save much Hay , and consequently keep more Stock . I understand that this is one of the Methods they have Practised by which they have Improved their little Farms which would formerly afford Keeping but for One Cow , now Ten Cows have their Maintenance from the same Ground . It is further said , Sheep fat sooner upon Coleworts than with the best Grass ; and that Sheep Fatted upon Coleworts will Sell better in the Market , than the Grass-fed Sheep . Our Winters are so sharp , that I do not think it will do for Winter feed here , as it doth in England , yet it may be of some Service that way ; for we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and will hold green a considerable Time  | after the Frost hath been severe , and this without any Shelter or Covering at all . I have been the more particular upon this Article , as what may be of public Advantage ; for although we have often heard of Rape Seed Oyl , yet it is not generally known that this Oyl is made of Cole-wort Seed . As it may be to our Advantage to Sow a great Variety of Grain , so various sorts of Grass that are good should be propagated among us , and may be equally Advantagious . We should have Grain and Grass to suit various Sorts of Land . We many Times , as it were , commit a Rape upon our Land , by forcing it to that Improvement for which it is not fitted by Nature : We have the clearest Discovery of this in Flax ; we shall see it flourish well on some Land , and again in other Land full as strong , and good for Grain , yet there Flax will do nothing . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we Sow , although as yet we have not the Skill to find it out . This is a piece of Knowledge in Husbandry in which we are still very Deficient , and must be obtained by strict Observation and Experience . Indian Corn , as it is a Native of the Country , seems to do well in any sort of Land , either Sand or Clay , High , or Low Land , Provided it be but Strong , whether it be made so by Art or Nature . There are Two sorts of Grass which are Natives of the Country , which I would Recommend ; these are Herd-Grass , ( known in Pennsylvania by the Name of Timothy-Grass ) the other is Fowl-Meadow , sometimes called Duck-Grass , and sometimes Swamp-wire-Grass . It is said that Herd-Grass was first found in a Swamp in Piscataqua by one Herd , who propagated the same : That Fowl-Meadow Grass was bro't into a poor piece of Meadow in Dedham , by Ducks and other Wild Water-Fowl , and therefore called by such an odd Name . It  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hartford by the Annual Floods , and called there Swamp-wire-Grass . Of these Two sorts of Natural Grass , the Fowl Grass is much the best ; it grows tall and thick , makes a more soft and pliable Hay than Herd Grass , and consequently will be more fit for Pressing , in order to Ship off with our Horses : Besides it is a good Grass , not abundance Inferior to English Grass : It yields a good Burthen , Three Load to the Acre . It must be Sowed in Low , Moist Land ; Our Dreined Land when it is of sufficient Age , is Land very agreable to this sort of Grass . As the Seed is very Find , there is danger of Sowing it too thick as some have done , so as to come up thick like Hair ; this is a loss of Seed , and prejudicial to the Grass . When you bring too a Swamp by Flowing , have killed your Brush , and ditched your Land , and got it a little Dry , you may sow your Seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , establish it self , and prevent other bad Grass from taking Possession : Then you may clear off the Wood and Brush at your Leasure ; and then you will have good Grass to Mow as fast as you can Clear the Land . I have seen it grow Knee high where the dead Brush was very thick . This Grass has another good Quality , which renders it very Valuable in a Country where Help is so much wanting ; it will not spoil or suffer , although it stand beyond the common Times for Mowing . Clover will be lost in a great Measure if it be not Cut in the proper Season ; Spire Grass , commonly called English Grass , if it stands too long will be little better than Rye Straw ; if this outstand the Time , it is best to let it stand till there comes up a second Growth , and then it will do tolerably well : But this Fowl-Grass may be Mowed at any Time , from July to October . One of my Sons told me , That at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People told him was Cut in October ; he pulled out some of the Hay , it looked green , and had  | a good smell . This is a great convenience in time of Sickness , or any other Casualty whereby we may be hindred from Mowing in Season . This good Property renders it a fit sort of Grass for a new Country , where we often have Business croud too hard upon us . In reading Mr. Ellis , I find by him that in England they have got Hard Grass Seed from this Country , and set a Value upon it ; if they like that , they would like this much better . Our common Spire Grass beareth the Inequality of our Climate better than any other Foreign Artificial Grass : It is a Hardy Grass , and is the best we have for Winter Feeding . I have tried Two sorts of Grass , which they Value very much in England , viz. La Lucem and St. Foin ; 3 they will flourish a while , but others have found , as well as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Climate : A hot dry Summer , or a hard Winter will destroy it . I have some of the Seed sent to me from Philadelphia , by a good Friend there , which I design to try upon my Dreined Land , and see if I can succeed any better than I have done heretofore . As we ought to propagate various sorts of Grain and Grass , that so we may have the Advantage of all sorts of Land , and Seasons , so we should adapt our Tillage to the various sorts of Land which we Improve . We find Land will yield Wheat best when it is Plough 'd Three Times ; and some will be hurt by it . At Long-Island they turn up their Old Land for Wheat , and begin to Plough as soon after Wheat Harvest as they can : At Sowing Time Harrow their Land the same way that it was Ploughed ; in this way they have although not great Corn , footnote 3 " La Lucem , " that is , lucerne or alfalfa . " St. Foin , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fodder . Like alfalfa , it is long-lived and deeprooted . Cf. L. H. Bailey , Cyclopedia of American Agriculture , II , 564-65.  | yet there being but little Labour or Expence , they have saving profitable Crops . The Experienced Farmers say , that their Grass Ground thus Ploughed Once in Five Years mends the Land in this way of Tillage ; the Land must be smooth and free from Stones . Eight or Ten Years past , an old Experienced Farmer told me , that he had observed much Land worn out and soiled by shallow Ploughing ; he earnestly Recommended deep Ploughing , even thin shallow Land ; said that he had tried it long , and often : Thereupon I ordered a piece of Land to be Ploughed so deep , that our Farmers thought that I had spoiled the Land . We have had Wheat Twice since that Time upon the same Land , think that deep Ploughing did the Land no hurt , but good . I have been told , and know it by my own Observation , that if you sow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crops and Land will grow better . Some Land that at first would Yield but Five Bushels to the Acre , without the least charge of Dung , or any Manure , in Time would afford a Crop of Fifteen Bushels to the Acre . It should be Ploughed , and the Seed Harrowed in soon after the Crop is taken off , the sooner the better : It will take less Seed , because what sheds out in Harvesting the antecedent Crop , will serve , in part to Seed the Land ; and the Stubble being turned in when it is new and fresh , is much better than when it hath stood long Drying in the Sun and Wind . But I believe the principal Thing is the Sowing Early ; for although Rye will do when Sowed Late , better than Wheat , yet Early Sowing agrees with it better than with Wheat . I remember Hartlibb tells us that Sir John Culpepper sowed Winter Rye in the Spring , fed it close till common sowing Time , and had the biggest Crop that ever had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of sowing Rye Yearly , must be profitable ; as it mends the Land and the Crop , is obtained with little Charge ; the Land may be Ploughed with a small Team , and there is but little Expence of Seed . A small Crop obtained with little Charge , may afford more real Gain , than when you have a great Crop where much Labour and Cost is bestowed : By the great Crop you may get Fame , but by the small Harvest you may get the most Money . But to the successful Ordering this piece of Husbandry , some few Rules should be observed . 1 . Land that you would devote to this sort of Improvement , should be free of Stones , Stubbs , and such like Impediments , which might hinder your well Ploughing and Harrowing. 2 . The Land should be very free from Chadlock , 4 Tares , 6 Chess ; 6 which if in the Ground will increase very much in this course of Tillage. 3 . Also your Seed should be perfectly Clean , and free from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the like , although there be but little , yet it will increase from Year to Year , till you are run out before you have made a full Experiment . 4 . The Land that you would improve this way , must be intirely free from Blue Grass , called by some Dutch Grass , or Wire Grass . If the Land be inclined to this sort of Grass , that in a little Time you will be forced to give over this kind of Improvement ; as I know by Experience . For having a piece of Land , otherwise fit for this sort of Husbandry , in Two Years I was footnote 4 " Chadlock , " or " charlock , " wild mustard . 5 " Tares , " a climbing weed that sometimes infests grainfields. 6 " Chess , " a species of brome grass which is a troublesome weed , particularly in wheat fields . It is often erroneously regarded as degenerate or changed wheat . It bears a very slight resemblance to oats , and if reaped and ground up with wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is said to produce narcotic effects .  | quite beat out of the Field , by the universal spreading of this Grass , which took such full Possession of the Ground as to spoil the Crop in a great Measure . The Dreined Land hath succeeded so well this Two Years past , that the same Land which might be Bought Five or Sjx Years past for Six Pounds per Acre ; nay , even although it be not Cleared of the Wood and Brush , Provided the Growth be Killed with previous Flowing . By the way I would observe , That if a Swamp be full of small Brush , and but few great Trees , the cheapest and best Way is to Flow it , ' and Kill it with the Water ; but if there be but little small Brush , and the Land be very thick with Trees , it is best to Clear it by Hand ; for when it is Killed with Drowning the Land , the Trees are extremely hard to Cut , so doth but delay the Time , and increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried it , That the best Way is to draw off the Water at the beginning of the Dog Days ; 8 the Mud will be so heated with the Sun , that in this Method the Swamp will be more Killed in One Year , than it will be in Two Years when the Water is kept up all the Time : And it stands with Reason it should do so ; for it is the heat and scalding of the Water or Mud which doth the Business . I have observed , That where the Water stands deep , and consequently keeps cool , the Bushes and Trees are the longer before they Die . But however as this is not backed with much Experience , every One must Act his own Judgment . Since the Dreined Lands are so Valuable , we should Extend that Improvement as far as we can . I have observed in many Fields there are small Swamps or footnote v That is , flood it . 8 The hot , sultry season in July and August , when the Dog Star , Sirius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a good deep Soyl , and are very Rich ; and would be Profitable could they be Dreined : But they lye Low , and are incompassed on all sides with high Land , that is impossible to Drein them in the Ordinary Way . These Swamps or Frog-Ponds , contain some a Quarter of an Acre , some Half an Acre , and some Two or Three Acres . Let them be great or small , they are worth bringing too , if possible , at a reasonable Expence . If they can be Dreined , and Recovered at all , it may be done in a way that is Easy and Cheap . i . In the first Place , Clear off all the Bushes and let in the Sun full upon it ; and this alone will do more than most Men will believe , especially if it be not fed with Springs . If the Sun did not draw off abundance of Water , why do not the Mediterranian and Caspian Seas Drown all the Country round , when there are so many great Rivers continually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out-let ? 2 . Look round on all sides , and see if on some side of the Swamp there be not some River or low Ground which is Lower than the bottom of your Frog-Pond , which you desire to Drein . On that side near the edge of the Pond , dig an Hole so deep till you come to a Stratum or Layer of Gravel , or Coarse Sand , then stop , and by a Channel or little Ditch let the Water out of the Pond or Swamp into the Hole ; and observe if in the space of Three Days the Water begins to soak away , you may expect by this Means to Draw your Land ; This Subterranious Passage in Time will draw away the Water . But in order to succeed , you will find in a few Days there will be a fine Sediment , thin like a Cob-web in the bottom of the Hole , which will intirely stop the Passage of the Water ; but this Film is easily Broken by stirring up the Bottom with an Hoe .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be not stirred and broken once in a few Days . When you have drawn off the Water , so that you can Plough the Ground , that will effectually break up the Pan-bottom , ' so that the Water will Soak away , and the Land be Useful and Profitable for the Time to come . As to the Bushes that grow in these Frog-Ponds are Buttonwood , for the most part , it is difficult to subdue them any other way but by Ploughing . This way of Subterranious Driening , is more uncertain than when you have a Visible Out-let Drein , yet the Trial may be made with a little Charge . It is not only worth while to Drein and Subdue such Places on the account of the Profit that may be made hereby , but also for the sake of the Deformity that is hereby Removed : For these Frog-Ponds spoil the Beauty of a Field ; and are undesirable , like Ulcers or Sores in a Man 's Face . When you are about to Drein such Land , or looking out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drein , it is not much whether such River or low Land be near , or at half a Miles distance . I have known sundry such pieces of Land Dreined the common way , that have been so good , that in a short Time they have paid all the Charge Expended upon them , and would look as though they never had been what they really once were . It is a common Thing in Swamps to find the Moss Two or Three Foot deep : At first I was a great deal Concerned about it , how I should get rid of it ; as also whether the Land would be of any Worth if the Moss was Removed ; as is said , Can the Rush grow up without Mire ? Can the Flag grow without Water ? So I found when the Water was drawn off by Ditches , the Moss grew so Dry , that in a hot dry Season in the Summer , footnote 9 The firm subsoil .  | it would Burn quite down to the Ground : But to Burn that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fire to it when the Weather is Clear , the Sun Hot , and a strong Southerly Wind , which makes Fire rage more Fiercely , and do much more Execution than a Northerly or Westerly Wind : In a Northerly Wind the Air is Thin and Light , so that the Fire is not strongly Compressed : The Moist , Heavy South Wind prevents the Dissipation of the Fire and renders it more Compact . We see a Smith will swab and wet his Coals , by which Means the Heat is greatly Increased . Now whether the Reasoning be just or not , the Fact is certain , which is the chief Concern of a Farmer . In the First Essay it is said , That the deep Swamps are to be preferred to , and Chosen before those that are Shallow ; and I am now more Confirmed in my Choice : For Experience chews that the deep Soil beareth extream Drought better than any other Land in the hot Season . The cold Drought in the Spring will hurt such Land , so that the first Crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second Crop will be extraordinary good . The Reverend Mr. Todd was offered Thirty Pound for the second Crop , or Rowen of Half an Acre . The red Clover in my Dreined Land , which in the Latter End of May last , in the cold Drought looked then as though it would come to nothing ; when hot Weather came on , although the Drought continued , yet the Grass recovered to a good Colour , and grew up well . This is what may be Considered as a very great Advantage , and justifieth the Choice of a deep Soyl , of Eight or Ten Foot deep . Our Ditching and Dreining drieth only the Top of the Ground , not more than Three Foot deep in the hot and dry Season , I suppose that the Moisture from the Mud and Water  | underneath is drawn up by the Force of the Sun , so the Roots of the Grass are furnished with sufficient Moisture to bring forward such a mighty Burthen of Grass . It is to be Observed , that this is not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Altered by the Sun and Air ; for at the first , soon after it is Dreined , it pincheth with the Drought more than any other Land . Those Swamps which are thick overgrown with Moss , when they are so far dried by Dreining , that the Moss will Rot , or Burn off , that Land proveth as good as any other Dreined Land . I mention this , because it is best that the Farmer Work as free from Discouragement as possible . Our Dreined Land , which is so good for Indian-Corn , and in all other Respects is so well adapted for Producing that Grain , yet being Moist and of a very loose Contexture , the Corn Planted becomes an easy Prey to Crows , and other Birds ; unless prevented will pull up a great part of it , and destroy the Crop ; which is a great Loss , in Land so Fruitful as we find such Land commonly is : This is a great Difficulty attending such Land . Which to Avoid : Take the Roots of Swamp Hellebore , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This Root is known by these several Names in different Places . Boil these Roots in so much Water as to keep them covered an Inch deep ; by Two Hours Boiling the Liquor will be of sufficient Strength , Strain it out ; put in your Corn while the Liquor is Warm , and let it Steep Twenty Hours , then it will be fit for Planting . This is found to be an Effectual Security in the Case . The Reverend Mr. Todd informs me , That having met with much Trouble and Loss , having had his Corn repeatedly Pulled up , he Planted his Ground with soaked Corn , Steeped  | in the aforesaid Liquor ; but not having enough of that , he ordered the Planting to be finished with Unsoaken Corn . The Event was , that the Birds pulled up but Two or Three Hills of the Soaked Corn , but left not One in Ten of those Hills which were Planted with the Unsoaked Corn : This which was thus pulled up he Planted over again with Soaked Corn , except some Hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second Time , with Unsoaked Corn ; it was Planted in the Middle , thinking that the Birds would not find it ; but the Result was , as before ; the Unsoaked was all pull 'd up , and the Hills Planted With the Steeped Corn was spared . Therefore with a great deal of Reason he concludes his Letter to me in the following words . Upon the whole , I think this Experiment to be a full Proof that Corn so prepared when Planted , is secure from the Birds : The Knowledge of which I can not but think will be of great Service to the Country ; as the Preparation is Cheap and Easy , and our Swamps seem by far to be the best Land we have for Indian-Corn : My little Swamp this Year Yielded at the Rate of above Ninety Bushels to the Acre , and was Easier and Cheaper Tilled than the same Quantity of Upland .

Altho ' Herd Grass be a Valuable sort , yet the Fowl Meadow Grass hath quite eclipsed its glory . The old Romans regarded the Study of Husbandry and the Improvement of their own Language as Two very important Parts of Learning , Men of the first Figure employed their Time in it .

APPENDIX The following Useful and Instructive Letter from Ebenezer Silliman , Esq : did not come to Hand , until this Essay was finished , I should do Wrong to the Public not to Insert it , although it be not in its proper Place . FAIRFIELD , Nov. 27th , A.D. 1749 . Rev 'd Sir , Having accidently had an Opportunity to see and cursorily to read your second Essay to promote useful Knowledge among your Country-Men , and to make them better Acquainted with the Art of Living ; a Design which I esteem truly Noble and Generous : I wish your endeavours may be attended with an Happy Success , and Men become better Acquainted with what may be a great Encouragement to Industry and Frugality . The Design I esteem worthy of Imitation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribute what he can , and to communicate what may fall under his own Observation and Experience that may be Serviceable . I have often lamented that footnote 12 The " Edinburgh Society of Improvers of Knowledge of Agriculture " was organized in 1723 . The Armstown society to which Eliot here makes reference was founded by John Cockburn , who spent a fortune in improving his estates .  | I was not able to make any considerable Offering of this Kind ; tho ' upon viewing your Observations about raising and increasing of Grass , have tho't that if any necessary Part of Husbandry may be accomplished with less Expence of Time and Labour , than in the usual Method it is attained , Proposals of this Kind might be worthy of Notice : this has prompted me to venture to communicate to you my own Practice in making of Hay , which may seem small and trifling at the first mentioning ; but finding it saves to me near two fifths of the Time and Labour I used to be at in that Article , and the Hay I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Method , I think it a sufficient Justification of my own Practice , and hope the mentioning and proposing of it will not be offensive to others : The Method is this : I mow my Grass and let it lie in the Swarth till the Dew is off the next Morning , and then I turn and spread my Hay and let it lie in the Sun till the after part of the Day , and then I rake it up and cock it well and never meddle any more with it till I cart it into my Barn or Stack it : ( and if the Weather be good it will do well to cart after it has stood two Days in the cock ) This 1 have found by five or six Years steady Experience answers for any sort of Hay , except Salt-bay and your red Clover , about which last mentioned I have not had so long Tryal ; but with respect to clover hay I managed it this Summer now past after this Manner , viz. I followed my Mowers , as they cut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and before night the same Day I put it in cock , and the next Day after the Dew was off I spread it again , and in the afternoon I cocked it the second Time and meddled no more with it till I carted it : and the appearance of the Hay since causes me to judge that no Man has better of that Sort : my first coming into this practice was purely accidental ; after cutting my Grass five or six Years past , I put it in the Cock the next Day , and then my Avocations were such that I had no Time in  | which I could possibly take any further care of my hay for many Days , tho ' exercised with fears of loosing most , if not all of it , and when I had dispatched my other affairs I went to take care of my Hay , and when I came to examine it found it in as good Order , ( that is the Bulk of it ) as ever I had hay in my Life ; and reflecting upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need to do , I have pursued the same Method ever since , and find it answers very well : The Reason why I take the Hay to be really better is , because I take it for granted , that the more Juice or natural Moisture we can retain in it , and not corrupt and rot the Stalk , the richer and more nutrimental it is : The too often turning and spreading of hay in the Sun extracts too much of the richness thereof ; and one Days thus lying will take away such a quantity of the most aqueous particles , as that the remainder is only sufficient to raise a proper fermentation thereof when in the Cock , and the smallness of the body when it is in the Cock keeps the fermentation from rising to such a Height as to corrupt it , and after Twenty four hours the fermentation will gradually abate , and the pitching of it into the Cart and afterwards into the Mow or Stack so checks it as that it will not again arise to such an height as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and less of it will support them : If you think there is any thing herein mentioned worthy of Notice , I submit to your disposal of it as you shall think proper , if not , I only ask Pardon for the trouble I have given you , and subscribe myself with great respect . Rev 'd Sir , Your Humble Servant , Eben . Silliman  | I went by the Field of the Slothful , and by the Vineyard of the Man void of Understanding . And lo , it was all grown over with Thorns , Nettles covered the Face thereof , and the Stone-Wall thereof was broken down . Then I saw , and considered it well : I looked upon it , and received instruction . Prov. xxiv. 30 , 31 , 32 . AS I proposed at first to publish an Essay yearly , accordingly sent my Copy to the Press the last April , but the Printer being employed in the Service of the Government , the Printing mine was necessarily postponed : What I most regretted was , that the Publication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Benefit of the Plantations , was hereby delayed . A very learned and beneficent Gentleman of Norfolk , having seen these Essays , and being willing to encourage the Design , from a generous Principle , a Desire to do Good , gave himself the Trouble to write a large Narrative of the great Improvements made in Husbandry in that County , in fifty Years last past , but more especially in the last twenty Years . As the Gentleman 's Performance doth sufficiently recommend mend itself , as the Subject , Matter , Style , and Manner of handling is above my Praise , I now present it to the Reader that he may judge for himself : I shall add no more , but that the whole Country are under great Obligations to him for his Generosity and Goodness , I take this Opportunity to offer my grateful Acknowledgement for his kind Assistance . " The Improvements made in the County of Norfolk , are  | talked of in all parts of the Kingdom ; and as I have frequently asked about them , and am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pains to become acquainted with the Nature of them , as well as their Rise and Growth . This I have been principally induced to do , because I find People generally mistaken in their Notions about them , and because as Tillage is not only the most ancient and honourable Employment in the World , but that to which the Disposition and Industry of the English Nation ; has , for many Years inclined them in a Degree conspicuously superior to the Rest of the World , as it greatly imports the Interest of the Nation generally to know by what Means it has successfully been carried on in every particular Part of its Territory ; for tho ' the like Success should not follow in many other Places , yet if it does in one , the Trial is well rewarded ; nay , if that Success be in a much less Degree , or if it answers not at all , the Experiment may hint an Advantage , that will amply compensate the former Disappointment . Thus it has been with Observations on the Powers of Nature in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sagacious Inquirer , Improvements in the Arts of civil Life very distant from his immediate Pursuit ; this is often the Effect of Chance ; but a judicious Husbandman will frequently acquire useful Knowledge from a Method of Tillage , that Climate and Soils , and other Circumstances , render impracticable , where Nature has placed him . It is currently believed in London , that the late Lord Townshend , was the first Inventor of Marling or claying lands in Norfolk : 1 This has no other Foundation , than that footnote 1 Lord Townshend 's estates in Raynham in Norfolk consisted mainly of rushgrown marshes , or sandy wastes . When Townshend revived the ancient and almost obsolete practice of marling , his neighbors prophesied that it would avail him nothing . He proved to his own satisfaction and to theirs , however , t hat they were wrong . Townshend was also an enthusiastic advocate of turnips . Indeed , so zealously did he recommend turnips as a main crop that he gained  | worthy Peer 's readily embracing an Opportunity of inriching his Tenants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by an Expence few Noblemen care to be at about Estates they seldom see , and which they know too little of , to judge them capable of making Returns answerable to the Money laid out on them . There are few great Estates in England , that will not pay 1o. per Cent . per Annum , for many Thousand Pounds judiciously laid out : And tho ' the Absence of their Possessors , and their Attention to more captivating Pursuits , prevents it for the most Part ; we frequently see Men of the first Quality turn their Thoughts this Way . The late Lord Townshend , when he retired into the Country , following Examples that he quickly eclipsed , he created Farms in the midst of Heath and Sheeps Walks , and found Means to make great Crops of Corn grow in fruitful Inclosures , divided by luxuriant Quickset-Hedges , upon Ground that had always been thought too poor for the Plow . I have said Lord Townshend followed Examples : Indeed these Improvements had already been carried great Lengths in the western Parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them at this Day . The first Person supposed to have marled a great Extent of Ground , was Mr. Allen of Lynge-House . Before him it was common to clay or marl only , two or three Acres beyond the Memory of any one that has been living within 40 or 50 Years . Marling Land in Staffordshire and Somersetshire , is of great Antiquity ; and I question not , is as ancient in the County I am writing of ; For we have Abundance of old Pits , out of which , it is evident , some-what has been dug , and the footnote the nickname of " Turnip " Townshend . He was the initiator of the so-called " Norfolk " or " four-course " system of cropping , in which cereals , roots , and artificial grasses were alternated . See Lord Ernle , English Farming , Past and Present ( 3d ed. ) , pp. 174-75.  | upper Surface thrown in again ; and many of these have gone by the Name of Marl-Pits ; and Inclosures have been denominated from them above Two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To this it may be added , that more than one ancient Author mentions the searching the Bowels of the Earth for Materials to improve its Surface . Many great Benefits accrued to England during the Republican Government of the Long Parliament : Among others , I reckon the Introduction of Artificial Grasses , which , tho ' they did not become general for many Years , yet then seem 'd , first , to have gained a Footing , as I judge , from the Writings of Mr. Hartlib and Capt . Blith : 2 It was in the succeeding Reign , the Bounty upon Corn was granted . About the Beginning of the present Century , sowing Turnips in Fields for the Feeding of Cattle began : The Advantages arising from Inclosures have been long understood in all Parts of the Kingdom , and it has become more feasible by the wearing out of small Possessors , whose intervening Land prevented fencing large Tracts . This had particularly been the Case in Norfolk , where , in most of the Townships formerly uninclosed , the Lands have since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length rendered Men 's Possessions more intire . The Soil of the County of Norfolk is mostly a light Loam , generally pretty deep ; the Farmers of the western Parts , for many Years , made it a considerable Part of their Husbandry , to keep Flocks of Ewes for producing Lambs , which they sold for Stock to the neighbouring Countries . The Price of Wool has been decaying ever since the Prohibition of its Exporta- footnote 2 Walter Blith , a captain in the Roundhead army , contributed significantly to the history of English agriculture during the mid-seventeenth century . Among other things , he suggested the employment of more capital , enclosures , abolition of " slavish customs , " the removal of water mills , the extinction of " vermine , " and the recognition of tenant right . He also ably discussed the necessity and methods of drainage . His volume entitled The English Improver Improved ( 1652 ) embodies his suggestions .  | tion ; and the Price of Sheep , when our Improvements began , was lower than they had been formerly : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Husbandry , that lessened these Commodities , and increased Corn , Butter , and BlackCattle . To all these perhaps I may venture to add a remote Cause , that , probably , had some Effect , at least by raising Corn to a better Price , some Years . Every one knows the immense Quantities of Corn the Dutch used every Year to bring from Poland , by Way of Dantzick : This seems much to have decreased of late , partly from the destructive Wars that have so frequently laid waste that fertile Kingdom ; partly , perhaps , from a greater Want of Grain in Sweden than formerly ; the Russians , since the Peace of Nystadt , remaining in Possession of the only Corn-Country that ever belonged to that Crown , and suffering an Exportation only when they please . These two last Causes could not but have the more sensible Effect in Norfolk ; as much Land there , had , in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth , been converted from Tillage , to the Use of keeping Sheep ; and , as the Coast of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any in England . I have been enumerating the Causes that helped forward the great Improvements we have lately seen in this County ; and have produced a Course of Husbandry , utterly unlike that used a hundred Years ago , tho ' gradually gaining Ground since that Time ; this will be better understood by viewing its progressive State in several different Farms : Where the Tenants , to this Day , are not to be persuaded to quit a Course of Agriculture , that has subsisted themselves and their Fathers , tho ' it be to take up one that their Neighbours have got Estates by ; in the open Field-Farms , of which , some small ones still remain , there is no Means of taking the Benefit of Clover and Turnips , yet some of these have marled their Grounds , but with Success , much short of their inclosed  | Neighbours ; their Husbandry is precisely that of their Great Grandfather 's ? Grandfather . Wheat follows a Summer Fallow , and is succeeded by two , three or four Crops of Barley , Oats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Year 's Rent , in three , four or five is lost , and yet the Land is always poor and foul , the best of it is let from five to eight Shillings per Acre , and no Tenant can well live on it ; some few will sow a little Clover , but reaps little Benefit , being obliged to tether their Cattle , and when all turn their Beasts in , it is every one 's Feed as well as theirs . Upon many inclosed Estates , the Farmers and Owners will not marl , and sow little Clover , taking their Wheat or Rye after a Summer Fallow ; yet they all sow Turnips , but generally begar their Lands , by taking many successive , and consequently poor Crops : They , who want Marle never inclose their uninclosed Lands ; but there are many who marle , yet never inclose , at least with a permanent Fence , consequently , can not enjoy the whole Benefit of the Clover and TurnipHusbandry . I shall now proceed to show what this is , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have said , the Rent of our Field-Land is mostly from five to eight Shillings per Acre ; this , when a Man can possess himself of an entire Tract , is frequently the Subject of the Improvement we are speaking of . But more commonly it is upon our Break-Lands we improve : These let from two to four Shillings per Acre , and have been used for Sheep 's Feed , seven , ten , fifteen Years , and being then broke up , yielding us a Crop of Rye , that was generally followed by a Crop of Oats or Barley , after which the Land took its Rest again , as Sheep 's Walk ; and more of the same took its Turn . When this has laid some Years , it becomes covered with a thick short Grass-Sward , on this we lay from forty to sixty Score Cart-Loads per Acre , of Marle  | or rich Clay , which last we generally reckon the better the less rough , it is mostly grey , or Marle brown ; the latter was formerly esteemed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown the former answers better on light warm Land : It is , besides , more easily procured , every thirty or forty Acres affording us a new Pit , which would otherwise be too remote , the Carriage being so expensive . These Pits , for the most Part , hold Water and become Ponds , one of which we contrive to get in each Field or Inclosure ; a Benefit I have heard Farmers say , worth onefourth of the Rent of the Land when it is fed by Cattle in Summer , which is often two Years in five . The Fence is White-Thorn on a Bank , in every Rod we place an Oak-Tree , many of which , planted since this late inclosing began , are becoming of a Stature that promises us Timber in the next Generation : White-Thorn thrives greatly with us , and our Hedges , with the Trees , form a Shelter for both Corn and Cattle , very conducive to their Welfare . Upon new improved Land , we seldom at first sow any Thing but Turnips , the hoeing these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix the new Accession with the old Surface : This is still more effectually done , by feeding Cattle in the Winter on these Turnips , either first pulling them up with an Instrument for that Purpose , or leaving the Beasts to help themselves , the former makes least Waste , the latter mixes and meliorates the Earth the most effectually . When the Land is subject to be very wet in Winter , we often carry off the Turnips to another Piece of Ground ; thus they go furthest ; but as this Ground is much benefited , it is at the Expense of that from whence the Crop is brought : After Turnips comes Barley or Oats ; with these are sown CloverSeeds , which produce a Crop the following Year , and is either mown for Hay or pastured with Cattle . Wheat regularly succeeds Clover , and thus no Crop is lost . The Land is some-  | times ploughed three Times for Wheat , but very often but once ; the Clover being ploughed in , and the Wheat harrowed in upon it , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is prevented by the next Crop of Turnips , when the Wheat Crop is clean , Barley is often sown after it . But the whole Course of our Husbandry will best appear from an original Book kept of the Crops , on the inclosed Parts of three Farms , most of which are improved for twelve Years , including some of the Crops of the thirteenth ; it will appear from hence , our Farmers , sometimes , use a Summer Tilling when it happens to suit their Convenience . 1 come now to the Consequence of this Method . First , We sow on these improved Farms five Times as many Acres of Wheat , twice as many of Barley ; of the former will grow three Times as much on an Acre , of the later twice as much as formerly . The whole Country has acquired a more chearful Appearance , and indeed more comfortable , from its numerous Defences against the Sun in Summer and bleak Winds in Winter . There is three Times as much Work for the Labourers , in Ploughing , Sowing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Families , who have almost twice as much Work , yet the Necessaries of Life are cheaper . One Farm is split into two , three , four or more : New FarmHouses are erected : The old Ones repaired : Nothing but Brick-Houses are to be seen here : Our Towns on the Coast and Market Town encreases daily with the Business done in them : Our Carpenters are twice as many : Our Masons or Bricklayers ten Times : Our Gentry have , many of them doubled their Estates : Those whose Lands were capable of Improvement have done more : Mr. Morley of Barsham 's Estate , is ? 800 per Annum : I have heard a few years ago , it was let at ? 180 . The most extraordinary Instance is that of Mr. Dun , who has at Schulthorp about ? 240 per Annum : I am told this was let to a Warrener of Rabbits , for ? 18 per  | Annum . These Instances are , however , rare : The improved Lands are worth from nine to twelve Shillings without Tythes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on Leases of Twenty-one Years , have laid out their Stock on Lands hired at old Rents , and are become worth above ? 10,000. each . The Clay laid on the Soil , and mixed is not only an Accession of fresh Earth that never bore any Thing before , but with the former , becomes a rich , yet light and warm Soil , capable of producing the best , Crops of Grain , as from four to five Quarters of Wheat per Acre , and sometimes even more , yet ploughed by a Boy and two Horses worth FortyShillings or Three Pounds a Piece , who will plough two Acres a Day , while in most other Parts of England they plough with four Horses , nay , even six , a Man and a Boy , at which great Charge they plough from two to three Rods per Day . Essex , and the adjacent Part of Hertfordshire , are usually thought as rich as most of the Kingdom ; thus they plough there , and never get a Crop of Wheat without a Year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheat be at Twelve Pounds per Last they can not live , at the same Time the Norfolk Farmers get Money . It is not to be supposed , this Improvement by claying or marling , lasts but a certain Number of Years ; yet we are well convinced , that if the Materials be good , and the Soil proper for the Improvement , it will last for ever , if managed in a good and husband like Manner , with Clover and Turnips , and inclosed : There is a good deal of Land , from thirty to forty Years Improvement , and some from forty to sixty , much better than any unimproved Land , and that is not visibly worse since the first Six Years ; during which Time , indeed , the Produce is frequently extraordinary : But even this may be gained , by adding twenty or thirty Load per Acre , once in  | thirty Years . An Expence amply repaid by the Success that never fails to follow it . As I said before , our Soil is generally a deep Loam but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a light Soil , so near a meer Sand , that it is reported to be incapable of Improvement : Of this I have no Experience myself , for I can not call to Mind ever to have seen Land , that had been attempted to be improved unsuccessfully , yet I very well know much that has answered Improvement , after it had been many Years reported unfit for it . We have a Sort of blue Clay , uncommonly tough , sometimes , indeed almost always , full of small Chalk-Stones . I have heard some very judicious Gentleman assert this to be good for Nothing , because it is apt to lye in the Lumps it is laid on in , without dissolving ( as they affirm ) for ever , without incorporating with the old Soil : This I have heard say , has been fruitlessly laid on the light Land I just now spoke of ; and after lying long on the Surface , continually hardening in the Air , it has gradually sunk deeper into the loose Earth every ploughing till utterly lost . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Account , from the Number of sensible Men I have had it from , yet can scarcely persuade myself , some Part does not moulder and fatten the Ground it is laid on : I have , myself , observed this sort of Clay lying in undissolved Lumps , many Years after its being laid there , where the Soil has been too stiff to permit its Descent . And here it is proper to take Notice , that the most skilful Husbandmen have long agreed , that to make the most of this Improvement , it is necessary to plough with Art . Most of the Clay used for Improvement , has a Mixture of small ChalkStones except the whitest ; and these , perhaps , help to give it a Warmth or Power , at least of producing a Warmth in the improved Land , that has been very beneficial to our colder Lands , where I have seen Benefits arise from it , equal to any  | in a warmer Soil ; in the latter , it helps to retain Moisture ; but in Loam it is observable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet Summer , it is worst in a very dry One : This , however , is seldom the Case in England , once in ten Years , in such a Season ; however great the Appearance may be , early in the Spring , it is astonishing how it scalds and falls off beyond other Land of not half the Value . The Carriage of six Score Cart-Loads of Clay is generally worth about One Pound four Shillings ; the filling , digging , and spreading , the same ; thus four Score Loads per Acre , costs us about One Pound twelve Shillings , including and contingent Charges , will make it up Two Pounds . We can generally advance our Rents Four Shillings per Acre ; thus our Accession of Rent stands us in Ten Years Purchase . This will seem little in Pensylvania perhaps , but is a very eligible Method of employing Money in England , where Lands seldom sell for less than 20 Years Purchase , , commonly for much more , and that charged with Taxes , Repairs , &c.; both which this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they occured , for the Entertainment of Mr. Bartram , or Mr. Eliot of Connecticut , who , I am informed , are ingenious and curious Persons in Pensylvania and New-England ; and which I was induced to do , by observing from a Letter of F. Bartram 's , to his Friend Mr. P. C. was so kind as to communicate to me , that he is desirous of knowing somewhat of the State of Husbandry in England , as I know that to be one of the greatest and most beneficial Alterations that has takep Place in it , at any Time , and which is the more remarkable , has , together with the Advancement of Agriculture in the remote and hitherto poorer Parts of the Kingdom , considerably affected the Rents of those called the richest Parts of England ; for by Means of artificial Grasses , Wheat now growing on many Thousand Acres of Land , hitherto thought improper for it ;  | and by Means of the same , and Turnips , Beasts being fatted , eyen in the Winter and Spring better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hay being made of Clover , Lucerne and St. Foine . It is surprising , to observe how the Rents of natural Pasture , and that formerly called Wheat Land , are fallen in Value , while the Price of most other Things are rising . I believe all I have wrote is Matter of Fact . What Connection the Whole has I scarcely know , for I have wrote more than I dare read , tho ' all at one Setting , but have perused each Page as I went on , and corrected the most manifest Errors . " In Norfolk , when they have once inriched their Land , as above prescribed and directed , they are careful to order Crops , so that the Land may continue in the same State of Fertility , without any farther Additions of Manure : Their Method is the very Reverse of ours ; they never feed the Land with what is exhausting , two or three Crops successively , but after Wheat or Barley , they sow Pease or Clover , as I find by a Book the Gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scheme of Management , in certain Farms , for thirteen Years past : We are not so wise ; there is nothing more common , than to put two drawing Crops together after IndianCorn , then comes Oats . The Norfolk Method is well calculated for Weathersfield , ? Glassenberry , the East Side of Hartford , Windsor and Springfield ; in these Places there is Sand above and Clay below ; it is the same in many other Parts of the Country : But there are Places where there is so little Clay , and that so situated , as to render this Method impracticable ; and therefore , Ways and Means to manure , and to increase Dung , must be useful to the Farmer , especially , considering how little Dung we make in the ordinary Way , and how little all the Dung we make will produce . The Dung of Cattle , in the Summer , is very rich , and will  | do great Service , if we improve it in the best Manner ; therefore , to save it and increase the Quantity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , proportioned to the Number of Cattle , to be inclosed ; it was made long and narrow for these two Reasons : First , for the Convenience of ploughing it ; and Secondly , for the Advantage of setting and removing the EndFences , so often as I should have Occasion to plough up the Yard : When the Yard was fenced , I put in the Cows every Night , one Month ; then opened the two Ends and ploughed it up , ploughing as near the two Side-Fences as possible ; then reset the Fence , ploughing it up thus every Month thro ' the whole Summer , then carted it upon my next adjoining Land , it being very heavy , a long Land-Carriage is not easy ; I found the whole Furrow Depth of Earth was become Dung , making an Increase beyond what one would imagine : I had fourfold more than I should have produced in the common Way : This Dung was spread upon both Grass-Land , and CornLand ; I did not find but that its Effects were equal to other Dung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is , by carting into the Yard , a great Quantity of Sea-Ware , SeaWreck , or as it is commonly called , Sea-Weed ; this being trampled and broken short by the Cattle , and inriched with the Dung and Stale becomes good Dung , in six Months Time , and is much lighter than that made with Earth , and consequently much more fit for distant Improvement . This is the Method I have most frequently used : but I think the other Sort , made of Earth , to be preferable . Before I had tried the Way of making Earth Dung I was afraid , that it would deface and spoil the Street , but in a little Time the bald Place , by the Dew , the Sun , and other concuring Benefits of the Atmosphere swarded over again , and recovered to its pristine State ; so that Practice will not be attended with any lasting mischievous Consequence . Those whose Land is so full of Rocks and Stones , that they can not  | take Benefit by the first Method , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sea , can get no Sea-Weed ; and therefore , what can they do to increase their Dung , the following Method may well answer this Intention . Mr. Masters of Pensylvania , an ingenous and publickspirited Farmer , was so good as to write me a Letter , to inform me how he increased his Dung ; his Way is to hire poor Children to gather up the fallen dry Leaves in the Woods , and by Fence Sides ; puts them up in Stacks to settle , then carts them home , puts them into his Yards , his Stables and Cow-Houses , where they are poached and trampled in together , with the Dung and Stale of his Cattle ; and in the Conclusion , makes great Increase of Manure ; he has tried it so far , and so much , as to know it , to be a great Improvement . The Dung and Stale of Beasts is so abundantly charged and impregnated with Salts , proper to promote Vegetation ; which , to preserve intire , it is proper to mix it with hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed and volatile , otherwise the Sun will exhale much of the volatile Part , and the Rains will wash off a great deal of the fixed Salt . At Narraganset , I remember I saw Swamp Mud carted into a Cow-Yard to increase the Dung , was told that it served to that Purpose very well . For want of Dung common Sea-Salt may be made use of ; a Gentleman at Middletown , who came from the West-Indies , bought a Piece of poor Land , put on it five Bushels of Salt to the Acre , sowed it with Flax , a small Strip through the whole Piece he put no Salt upon it , the Consequence was , the salted Part produced fine tall Flax , and the small Strip was poor and short . A Man of Guilford told me , he had tried it upon his Wheat-Land , it assisted and increased his Crop very well . One of my Sons sowed five Bushels of Salt , last Fall , on his Wheat ; what will be the Consequence we can not tell yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salt seems not immediately adapted to promote Vegetation , but rather the contrary , especially if there be too much of it . It is said that the Isle of Ormas , the Soil being strongly impregnated with Rock-Salt , is very barren . In the Scriptures we find , that Saltness was an Indication of Barreness , natural and judicial . Judges ix . 45 . When he had taken the City , it is said of Abimelech , he slew the People that was therein , and beat down the City , and sowed it with Salt . Of him that trusteth in Man , it is said , Jer. xvii. 6 . For he shall be like the Heath in the Desart , and shall not see when Good cometh , but shall inhabit the parched Places in the Wilderness , in a salt Land , and not inhabited . Moab was threatened by the Prophet , that it should be as Sodom , and the Children of Ammon as Gomorrah . Zeph. ii . 9 . The breeding of Nettles and Salt-Pits . Deut. xxix. 23 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and burning , that is not sown , nor beareth , nor any Grass groweth therein . There are two sorts of Salt , which do immediately promote Vegetation , and render the Land fruitful : One is what is called Nitrous Salt , this is what is contained in Dung ; the other is called Alcalious Salt this is what renders Ashes such a useful Manure ; for if this Salt is dissolved with hot Water , and drawn off from the Ashes , as when . we make Lye , it robs the Ashes of its vegetative Vertue , so far as it is deprived of this Salt . Common Sea-Salt , although of itself , and in its Nature , it be unfit to divide the Earth ; and so to promote Vegetation , yet being of a kindred Nature with the other Salt , the Nitrous Salt of the Air and Earth joining with it , I conceive it is assimilated , overcome and converted to a Nitrous Salt . It ' is said , that where they make Salt-Petre , after they have drawn out all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whence  | it is extracted , they expose the Caput Mortuum , or Matter from whence it is drawn , to the Air , and in seven Years it is fit for a new Operation . Common Salt is used in England for Manure ; and is of so much Advantage in Farming , that Mr. Ellis in his Books of Husbandry , proposes that the Duty upon Salt should be taken off in Favour of Agriculture . Another Way of mending Land , is , what they call in England , green Dressing : This is by sowing Buck-Wheat , Oats or Rye , and when it is grown up and is full of Sap , then plough it in , after this let it lie till fully rotten , then plough again and sow your Wheat . I am told the Dutch People , on poor Pine Plains in this Way , have fine Crops of Wheat ; but for green Dressing I should prefer above all , sowing Millet , on the Account of the Cheapness of Seeding the Land , the Cost is but a Trifle ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good large Coat to turn in when ploughed . Being once at Kent , an old Country Farmer had been in the Practice of green Dressing , he had ploughed in green Oats ; it seemed to alter the Colour of the Land , it looked much better than the Rest of the Lot where there was nothing but a Furrow that parted : The Farmer said , that he could raise Land or increase the Strength , to a great Degree , in a few Years , in the following Manner ; after his Oats were harvested , he added some Seed to the scattered Oats , ploughed it in , at the End of September ploughed in the green Oats , and sowed it with Rye ; the next Summer , when the Rye was well grown and full of Sap , ploughed that in , at common sowing Time , it would be fit to produce a large Crop of Wheat ; all the Cost of Ploughing and Seed , is not so much as the Cost of Dung , Carting and spreading if we can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be had upon any Terms ; there are very few such bad Husbands as to sell their Dung . Mr. Edmond Quincy of Boston , a Gentleman of Learning  | and Ingenuity , to whom I am indebted for many useful Hints and Observations . He informs me , that having a Son residing at Portmore , in England , the young Gentleman writes , that some Farmers in that Neighbourhood are entered into a new Practice , which is to sow their dry Land which is not fit for Pasture with Rye , and feed their Sheep upon it , so that it may not spindle or grow up : That this Feed makes excellent Mutton , and will continue to grow from Year to Year without any Tillage or resowing ; he doth not say how long it will continue : Possibly the Practice is so new , that they do not know themselves . I have observed that where Sheep are well kept , and remain upon the Land Night and Day the Land will grow better . As Rye will indure the Heat of a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Drought : I suppose this may be of great Service in our Southern Colonies , where the Heat comes so fast , that the Grass has not Time to cover and shelter the Roots from the piercing Rays of the Sun : The Advantage of the Grass growing up before there is a strong Heat , is , that the Grass gathers and preserves the Dews for the Benefit of the Roots : When Dew falls upon naked and unsheltered Land that is not ploughed , made soft , and so fitted to drink up , and retain the Dews , or well cloathed with Grass ; what falls in the Night is exhaled in the Day , and thus the Ground is robbed of that which is the chief Riches of the Atmosphere . If I understand it right , this being the State of some of our Colonies , the above named Method of making artificial Pasture with Rye , may be of Advantage to them , and of use also to us where the Soil is dry . That Wheat and Rye bear Drought much better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English Proverbs . Wet May , makes short Corn and long Hay , Dry May , makes long Corn and short Hay .  | As the old English Proverbs contain Truth and good Sense , founded on due Observation and Experience , I have a Fondness for them . The Honourable Society for promoting Husbandry and Manufactures in Ireland , published a Way of raising Calves , that appears rational , natural and easy . As this Essay may fall into such Hands as may never see it , unless it be by this Conveyance ; I shall insert it with the Advantages that arise from it . Take the best English Hay , chop and bruise it , put into a Churn or Barrel , pour boiling Water in such Proportion as that it will be well impregnated with the Spirit and Vertue of the Hay . Never let the Calf suck at all : For the first ten Days , give a Mixture of three Quarts of Milk , and one Quarter Hay Tea ; the next ten Days , half Milk and half Hay Tea ; all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit to wean , give three Quarters Hay Tea , and one Quarter Milk : ' They say that Calves brought up in the Way will not be Potbelied . By this Means the natural Food of Cattle is prepared , by extracting the nutritive Vertue and Spirit of Hay , mixed in a Fluid , and so fitted to the tender Stomach of such young Creatures . I apprehend there are many Advantages resulting from this Method . First , It is generally allowed , that the Milk of a good Cow , in six Months , is equal in Value to her Body ; the saving two Months Milk is considerable , or if it were but one Month , it is not to be despised . Second , This Way is much better for the Cow . A Farmer of my Acquaintance , who kept a Stock of 70 Head of Cattle , always brought up his Calves by Hand , giving them all the Milk ; this he did without any such Saving , only for the Benefit of his Cows . Third , Another Advantage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bull ; there is more Loss in a Cow 's going Farrow , than People ordinarily imagine ; it is a great Charge to keep Cattle Winter and Summer : An Ox pays the Charge of Keeping with his Labour ; young Cattle in their Growth , a fatting Beast , with his Fat and Flesh ; a breeding Cow pays with her Calf and Milk , but a dry Cow pays nothing at all . Fourth , I may add also , that this Way of bringing up Calves , saves the Trouble and bawling Noise of Weaning . If those Farmers who have great Stocks , will not be at this Trouble , yet one would think , at least , that those People , who have many Children , and but one or two Cows , should readily fall into his saving Way . It is some Time since I saw the above mentioned Receipt , so am not certain as to the Periods , whether a Week or ten Days , and think it not material . There is a Weed which grows in wet Meadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vines of Pease ; when it is hayed with the Grass , the Cattle eat it freely ; it is of such mischievous , noxious Quality , that it makes Mares , Cowes , and Ewes cast their Young , to the great Detriment of Farmers . A Person of good Credit told me , that by giving his Cattle a Cock or two of such Hay , he lost by it , to the Value of Forty or Fifty Pounds : Not knowing the botanical Name of this Plant : from its ill and singular Quality , we call it StijnkWeed : I had Abundance of it in one Swamp , and I know by Experience , that draining will intirely destroy it , and it is for this Reason that I mention it . There is another Weed called St. John 's Wort ; it fills the Ground , we are obliged to cut in with the Grass , to rake it , cart it , house it , carry it out , and when we have done , no Creature will eat one Mouthful of it , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead Weight upon the Farmer . To kill and 3 Steins.  | eradicate this , put in Sheep early in the Spring , and in two Year they will destroy it without any Hurt to Sheep . Some Trials I made last Year , gives me Reason to hope , that I have found out certain Seasons for cutting Bushes , by which they will be more effectually destroyed by once cutting , than I have ever yet found , till now , , which if I find according to my Hopes , I design in my next Essay to communicate it . In a former Essay , I mentioned the strange and peculiar property of Foul Meadow Grass , that it will hold out to be in Season for cutting , from the Beginning of Jut ) ) till some Time in October ; this I wondered at , but viewing some of it attentively , I think I have found the Reason of it : When it is grown about three Foot high , it then falls down , but doth not rot like other Grass when lodged ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at every Joint it puts forth a new Branch ; now to maintain this young Brood of Succors , there must be a plentiful Course of Sap conveyed up through the main Stem , or Straw ; by this Means the Grass is kept green , and fit for mowing all this long Period . Whether this young Growth from the joints , be owing to the horizontal Position of the Straw , or whether it is a Confirmation of that Doctrine , that the Joints of Plants are SeedVessels , I leave to Naturalists to determine . I find by Experience , that the best Time to mow this Grass , is when these new Branches or Succors have obtained to their full Growth . In my third Essay , I proposed the making Rape-Seed-Oil ; being misguided by an Author , I informed the Reader , that Rape-Oil is made of Colewort-Seed : The learned and ingenious Mr. Peter Collinson , of London , F. R. S. having seen these Essays , approves well of the Design of making RapeOil ; From a Regard to Truth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to let me know that Rape-Oil is not made  | of Colewort-Seed , but from the Seed of a Plant called Cole : was so good as to send , last Year , some of the true Seed . This worthy Gentleman has been so generously kind , as lately to send me some Wheat which came from Thessaly , it is a Kernel of a large and long Body ; as also some Flax-Seed , which came originally from Siberia , which is perreniel ; I have sowed as directed ; he saith of this Flax , that it grows with them above five Foot high , and thinks , that with us it will turn to a good Account , as it comes from a very cold Country , and requires but once sowing .

Pearls are prescribed in Medicine for great People : but is not of Use but as a testacous Powder ; and for that Use an Oyster Shell will do as well : But many Things in high Esteem have no intrinsick Worth at all . footnote * As the Indians of Peru , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World , although they had no Iron , yet they had plenty of Gold and Silver .

Husbandry and Navigation are the true Source of natural or real Wealth , Without Husbandry , even Navigation can not be carried on ; without it we should want many of the Comforts and Conveniences of Life . Husbandry then is a Subject of great Importance , without which all Commerce and Communication must come to an End , all social Advantages cease , Comfort and earthly Pleasure be no more . Nay , this is the very Basis and Foundation of all nominal or artificial Wealth and Riches .

And there was a great Famine in Sarnaria ; and behold they besieged it until an Asses Head was sold for four Score Pieces of Silver , and the fourth Part of a Kab of Doves Dung for five Pieces of Silver . With Submission , I rather think it should be rendered , the Contents of the Dove 's Crop . The Dove 's returning home from the Field with Crops full of Pease and other Grain , would , when extracted , be a welcome Entertainment to the hungry Inhabitants , and sell for a good Price ; whereas the proper Excrements or Dung , especially of such Animals who void no Urine , is so loathsome , and so destitute of Nourishment , as to be unfit for Food , even in Times of greatest Extremity . If second hand Food has been so high in the Market , how valuable are the clean Productions of the Earth ? Husbandry is the true Mine from whence are drawn true Riches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such Advantage in raising Corn , in the foregoing Essay the Reader had set before him the Norfolk Husbandry , where we find that Clay answers all the Ends and Purposes of Dung , and for Dura-  | tion much exceeds it : As also divers Ways , of making , and Methods to increase the Quantity of Dung or Manure . In this Essay , I design to shew how Land may be tilled , and the Dung so applied as that a little Dung shall extend as far , and do as much to promote and produce a Crop of Corn , as six Times so much Dung applied in the Common Way . The old worn out Land is to be tilled in such a Manner that affords a Prospect , that the same Land in two or three Years , shall produce Crops without Dung , or any Sort of Manure , in some Measure agreeable to the Method of the excellent and truly learned Mr. Tull ; 1 a Summary of whose Principles or Doctrine , F here present to the Reader in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Earth , is to divide it " into many Parts , by Manure or by Tillage , or by both : This " is called Pulveration . The Salt of Dung divide or pulverize " the Soil by Fermentation , Tillage by the Attrition or Con " tusion of Instruments , of which the Plough is the Chief . The " Superficies or Surfaces of those divided Parts of the Earth , is " the Artificial Pasture of Plants , and affords the Vegetable " Pabulum to such Roots as come into contact with it . There " is no Way to exhaust the Earth of this Pabulum , but by the " Roots of the Plants , and Plants are now proved to extend " their Roots more than was formerly thought they did . Divi- footnote 1 Jethro Tull stands at the head of the list of that distinguished group of Englishmen who have done so much to improve English agriculture . Son of a Berkshire landowner , he was born in 1674 . After Oxford , which he left without taking a degree , he entered Gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in 1699 to turn to farming . Twelve years later , the precarious state of his health drove him abroad . In 1714 he returned to his native land , where until his death in 1440 he lived in a solitary farmhouse near the borders of Berkshire and Wiltshire . Here , removed from friends and remote from scientific appliances , he conducted his experiments and recorded his observations . In 1731 he published the results of his thirty years ' experience as a farmer . This volume , The New Horse-Roughing Husbandry , aroused ' a storm of criticism which cut deep into his sensitive nature . His chief legacies were superior tillage , clean farming , economy in seeding , the value of sainfoin and turnips as field crops , and his invention of the seed drill .  | " sion is infinite , and the more Parts the Soil is divided into , " the more of that Superficies or vegetable Pasture must it " have , and more of those Benefits which descend from the " Atmosphere will it receive . Therefore if the Earth be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it answers the same End as if it " had been performed by Dung . " In the fore-cited Passage , Mr. Tull has had but little Regard to the Capacity of his Reader : Nor will it be much better understood than if it had been wrote ? n an unknown Tongue , there being so many Words used by him which common Farmers do not understand ; and therefore that Book has not been so useful as otherwise it might have been . That excellent Writer seems to me to have entered deeper into the true Principles of Husbandry , than any Author I have ever read . Had he taken Pains to accommodate himself to the Unlearned , his Book would have been much more useful than now it is . I am very sensible , that the low Stile , the Plainness and Simplicity of these Essays , has exposed them to the Centure of those who do not well consider for whom they are intended and written . It is much easier to let the Pen run forward in a pompous Parade of Learning , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicate important Truths in such Words as shall be understood , and to use such Plainness and Simplicity as will bring all down to the Level of the most inferior Capacity . It was a learned Man of the Age , instructed in the School at Tarsus , who compleated his Studies in the famous College at Jerusalem , under the Tuition of Gamaliel , the illustrious President of that renowned Seat of Learning : He was the very Man who said , i . Cor. xiv . 19 . I thank God I speak with Tongues more than you all ; yet in the Church I had rather speak five Words with my Understanding , that I might teach  | others also , than ten thousand Words in an unknown Tongue . I purpose to proceed in the same plain simple Manner , to set before the Reader the Way of mending our poor Land , and raising Crops , either without any Dung at all , or if any be applied , it shall be in such a small Quantity , that the Expence will be but little compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I pretend to no other Merit than that , I. To explain the Doctrine or Principles of Mr. Tull in such a Manner as to be open to any common Understanding . II . To offer such Reasons and Proofs for the Support of these Principles , as will naturally occur . III . To direct to the Performance , of the Work with Instruments less intricate , more plain , cheap and commodious , than those used and described by Mr. Tull . Under these three Heads may , I think , be comprehended all that I design at present to say of this Method of Husbandry , ' till Time and Experience shall enable me to write farther upon this important Subject : For if I succeed according to my Expectation and Desire , I apprehend Husbandry , in the Tillage of Land , will stand upon a good Footing . , The only Way we have to inrich the Land , is by Dung , or by Tillage separately , or by both of them together : It is performed by dividing the Earth into many Parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is done by making the Ground mellow and soft , so that the Roots may freely pass and find their proper Nourishment . The more mellow and fine the Earth is made , the more Roots will be sent out , from Corn or whatever is sowed or planted in such mellow Land ; and the more soft and mellow the Ground is made , there will be not only more Roots , but they will be longer and extend farther : so that the Corn , Turnip , Carrot , or whatever Plant it is , will receive so much the more Nourishment , and consequently  | grow so much the bigger and better . Dung , or any other Measure , divides the Ground , sets the Parts at a Distance , and so gives a free Passage to the Roots of Plants . In this Action the Salts in Dung hath much the same Operation and Effect as Leaven , or Emptyings hath on Dough ; it makes it rise , makes it light , that is , sets the Parts at a Distance . If nothing be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mellow by ploughing , or Dung , or both , no Crop can be expected . Sow or plant upon untill 'd Land , which is hard and uncultivated , no Corn will grow . If the Earth can be as well divided , and made as mellow by ploughing , digging or howing , why should not Tillage do without Dung ; provided the Tillage be equal , or in Proportion to Dung ? To do this in the common Way of repeated plain Ploughing and Harrowing , would be too much Charge and Labour : For Mr. Tull said , that three Times plain ploughing did only prepare the Land for Tillage . There is a Way of Tillage alone , without Dung , to make the Ground fine and mellow ; and this Way is cheap and effectual ; is done in the following manner , First plough your Ground plain , and plough it deep ; if you have no Dung , you must have the more loose mellow Earth : When it is thus ploughed , harrow it well with an Iron-Tooth Harrow ; let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dews , then plough it into Ridges ; to every Ridge there must be eight Furrows of the Plain-ploughing , two Furrows covered , four ploughed , and two left open ; so that in Ridge-ploughing the Team and Plough travels but half so far as in Plain-ploughing : Ridge-ploughing will cost but half so much as Plain-ploughing . I suppose I need not give any particular Directions concerning ploughing the Land into Ridges , every Ploughman understands this , or if he doth not , he may soon learn it of them that do . When it is thus ploughed into Ridges , it is prepared to plant with Wheat , or Cabbages , Carrots , or what  | else you see fit to plant . In what Manner , and with what Instruments the Seeds of Wheat , Turnips , or Cabbages are to be planted , I shall describe under the third Head , when I come to speak of the Instruments by which it is performed . I shall only add in this Place that the Wheat is to be planted in two Rows on the Middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inches Distance ; the Cabbages and Turnips in one Row on the Middle of the Ridge , the Turnips at six Inches Distance from each other , Cabbages at a Foot and Half , or two Foot Distance ; Carrots are to be planted in two Rows at ten Inches distance , that is , the Space between the Rows is to be ten Inches , the Carrots to be planted at six Inches Distance one from the other , as they stand in the Line or Row . The Reader will observe , that as yet there is no more Tillage applied to the Land than what is common and usual in our ordinary Way of Husbandry . Now , what follows , is that in which the Art and Mistery doth consist and when it is described and set before you , will appear so simple , so little , so mean , that it will be to you as go wash in Jordan was to Naaman the Syrian . Suppose it be Turnips , Cabbages or Carrots planted in the Spring , ( for as to what relates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that distinctly by itself ) as soon as your Cabbages and Turnips can be seen , weed them with a small hand Hoe . The Carrots for the first Time must be weeded with the Fingers ; this is tedious Work : When this is done , and the Plants a little grown so as to be plainly seen , then take one Yoke of Oxen , a long Yoke so long that one Ox may go in one Furrow , and the other Ox in the other , and the Ridge between , in the same Manner as we plough Indian Corn : and with a common Ox Plow , turn of a Furrow from the Ridge , coming as close to the Plants as you can , and not plough them up ; you may come within two or three Inches , if the Oxen and Plough are good . Thus take off a Furrow from each Side of every Ridge till all is ploughed ;  | let it lye in this State a Fortnight or three Weeks , then with the Plough turn up the two Furrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and turn the two Furrows , off from the Ridge again ; the oftner this is repeated so much the better : We ordinarily do it but four Times ; but seven times will do better . When the Plants grow larger , you must keep the Plough at a greater Distance ; for if you plough as near the Plants as when they are small , you will cut off too many Roots . You must hoe between the Rows of Carrots with a narrow hand Hoe , to kill the Weeds ; and to till the Ground between the Rows , you must mind to dig deep . Turnips , and whatever is planted in a single Line or Row , must be tended with a hand Hoe , while the Plants are young , and ' till all the Weeds are destroyed so that you may use the Plough . I have been obliged to enter into the practical Part of this Sort of Husbandry , without which I should not be able to explain the Principles , or doctrinal Part , as I proposed under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it exceeding fine , soft , and mellow , beyond what you would imagine : This , we have shewed already , is one Thing requisite and needful . 2 . By this Tillage we open such Clods and Parts of Earth as never were opened before , and consequently never was touched by any Root ; its whole nourishing Virtue remains intire : In short it is new Land . Every one knows what new Land will do before its native and original Strength and Vigour is consumed and exhausted by the Roots of Corn and other Plants . Thus this Sort of Tillage doth , in a Degree furnish us with new Land . In this Way old Things become new . 3 . In this Way of Tillage we intirely destroy and extirpate all Weeds and Grass yea , even that stubborn Grass called Blue Grass , which is so hurtful to Corn ; by which a whole Crop is frequently almost destroyed . This Grass by many is called Dutch Grass ; and probably that Grass in England there  | called Couch Grass , may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resemblance or Likeness of Sound ; their Farmers making the same Complaint of it as ours do here . The Destruction of Weeds and Grass is of great Advantage in Tillage . Weeds very much exhaust the Land , hinder and damnify the Crop : The more these Robbers are destroyed , the more Nourishment there is for Corn . This Method not only destroys the Weeds for the present , but for the future also ; for ploughing stirs up the latent Seeds of Weeds , sets them a growing , and then destroys them when they are come up . The Seeds of Weeds are numerous and hardy , they will lye many Years in the Ground , and when by the Plough are properly situated for Growth , they will come up very plentifully : Charlock , 2 commonly called Terrify , which can not be subdued in the common Way of Tillage , I suppose in this Way , may be effectually conquered . That the Destruction of Weeds is one Design we have in View when we till Land , is what is allowed by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ End , and at least they act and conduct as if they thought so : If it were not so , why do they neglect to hoe and plough if there be no Weeds ? And why do they aim at going no deeper than just to cut up the Weeds ? But there are other great Advantages to be had by Tillage , besides killing Weeds , as has been said already , and will further appear . 4 . This Way of repeated ploughing keeps the Land from going out of Tillage . If Land be never so much ploughed and harrowed , and made ever so light and mellow , yet in a Year 's Time the Tillage is spent in a great Degree . The Weight of great Rains , and the natural Weight of the Earth , settles it down so that it is daily growing closer and harder ; there is less and less Room for the Roots to extend and spread , find their Food and get Nourishment ; for the Roots in Plants are footnote 2 Wild mustard , one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man and Beast ; the more Roots the more growth . When Land , by the Law of Gravitation , is thus continually sinking down , closeing together , and so going out of Tillage , we then plough it once in a Month , or oftener , if there be need . Thus the Tillage is kept up in the same State as at first . I find that a great heavy Rain if it fall soon after the Land has been ploughed , it will need ploughing again : In dry Weather it will continue in a State of Tillage much longer . Our Indian Corn has this repeated Tillage ; but our Wheat suffers much for Want of after Tillage : We sow one Year and reap the next , so that from sowing Time ' till Harvest , is ten or eleven Months . 5 . There is in Land a twofold and opposite State which renders Tillage absolutely necessary : This repeated plowing answers for both . In the common and ordinary State of Land , it is too hard and close , the parts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Roots to spread downwards , and side ways ; or at least these Pores , Holes or Passages , are too small and too few to give Room for the Roots : Often and repeated ploughing sets the Particles of Earth at such a Distance , and so enlargeth these Pores or Holes in the Earth , that the Growth of Plants is by this Means greatly promoted . Although this be the ordinary State of Land which makes Tillage necessary ; yet there is some Land in a State just the Reverse : it is too light , its Parts are at too great a Distance , the Pores and Passages are too wide , so that the Roots are not big enough to fill the Pores , or Holes . If the Roots do not touch the Earth it can not get Nourishment : The Root should be inclosed on all Sides by the Earth . Every one knows that , Roots above Ground in the open Air , can do the Plant no good . All the Difference between Roots under Ground , which do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , that one is shaded , and the other is exposed to the Sun and Wind : But as Roots in the most hollow and light Land , touch  | the Earth in some Places , so they get some Nourishment and keep alive , yet the Plant makes but a poor Progress . I have a Piece of Summer Wheat in a drained Swamp , that almost died of this Disease : The Land was so new that it would not bear a Team , so that it could not be ploughed ; the Top Earth was exceeding light and puffy ; the Seed was howed in , it came up and grew well , so long as the Blade could live upon the Milk of the Wheat Kernel ; but when that Store was spent , and the Time was come that it must live by Nourishment obtained by the Roots , it turned yellow , and the Tops died : One of my Sons told me the Wheat would all die ; but an heavy Rain fell , which so closed and pressed this light Earth together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were inclosed on all Sides , the Corn recovered its Colour , grew vigorously and well , and put up good large Ears . This Land as much required ploughing as hard heavy Land would have done . Repeated ploughing in Land that is too light , and the Pores too large , will settle it down and close it together , contract and lessen the Pores , as well as raise the heavy Land , and enlarge its Pores . This seeming Contradiction , this blowing Hot and Cold out the same Mouth , may be well enough reconciled , and accounted for in a philosophical Manner : but so long as Experience shews that all this is true , it will be to no Advantage to the Farmer to say any more about it : Nor should I have entered so far into the Philosophy of Tillage as I have done , were it not necessary for a practical Farmer to understand it so far as to make a Judgment , and see into the Reason of this new Kind of Tillage and Farming : And this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Minds against what is new , or at least what Men suppose to be new . 6 . This Method or Way of repeated ploughing , fits and prepares the Land to receive and retain all the Benefits of the Atmosphere : It is now open to receive the floating Particles of Sulphur , and the nitrous Salts of the Air , the Benefit of tl e  | Sun 's Rays , which , when accompanied with a sufficient Degree of Moisture , enlivens and invigorates all.Vature . When the Winter bath brought a universal Gloom upon the Face of the vegitable Creation , Paleness and Death appears on all Sides : The Psalmist saith of it , Thou hidest thy Face they are troubled . Then speaking of the Sun , thou sendest forth thy Spirit they are created , and thou renewest the Face of the Earth . But above all this , we are hereby put in Possession of the Dews , which is one of the rich Treasures of the Atmosphere ; when Land is made fine a good Depth , it is prepared with open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the Dew falls upon Land that is untilled , or but poorly tilled , the Ground being hard it doth not sink deep , so the next Day 's Sun carries it all off again . It is the same if Land be too light and loose ; there is not a sufficient Connection of Parts to convey the Dew from one Particle of Earth to another : I apprehend , that the Moisture of the Dew passeth down in well prepared Land as Water is conveyed through a Rag in Filtration , if the Rag bath large Holes in it the Water will stop : But let this be as it will , it is certain , and known to every observing Farmer , that the best tilled Land in a dry Time , always is moister , and bears the Drought much better than the same Sort of Land which is but poorly tilled ; that Indian Corn , which is the best ploughed and hoed , will always bear the Drought best . And what is the Reason ? Because the Land is prepared to receive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he dug a Hole in the Ground a good Depth , reduced the Earth to fine Powder , and filled up the Hole with it : a Drought came on , this powdered Earth was moist to the Bottom , when the adjoining Land was exceeding hard and dry . Another Experiment was made thus , a Gallon of Rain-Water was put into a Bowl , and a Gallon of Dew-Water in another Vessel , and set them to dry away in the Sun ; the Consequence was , the Sediment or Settlings of the  | Dew-Water was more in Quantity , blacker and richer than that of the Rain-Water . The Dews and the Salts of the Air , is all by which the Land is inriched ; for the other Advantages of Ploughing are but transient . The Advantage this Way is so much , that Mr. Tull saith , that Land he hath improved this Way , by this kind of Husbandry , going into another Hand , who used it in the common Way of Husbandry , that Part of the Field was so much inriched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Difference for the better seven Years after . I suppose , that it is this alone which changed the Colour of my Land in six Months ; for having ploughed very deep , and turned up much Fox-colour 'd dead Earth , it soon became of a good brown Colour ; so that this Kind of Tillage seems likely to put us in Possession of Joseph 's Blessing : of which we have an Account , Deut. xxxiii. 13 , 14 , and of Joseph he said ; Blessed of the Lord be his Land , for the precious Things of Heaven , for the Dew , and for the Deep that coucheth beneath ; and for the precious Fruits brought forth by the Sun , and for the precious Things put forth by the Moon . Some understand by the Deep that coucheth beneath , to be the Springs and subterraneous Waters : but it seems more likely , to intend the Riches of the under Earth which coucheth beneath ; which , like a couching Lion , must be roused and raised up by a proper Tillage , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained the Principles of this kind of Husbandry , the Foundation and Reason of it , in as plain and easy a Manner as I can . Before I took any Step or Pace towards this Sort of Tillage , I read all I could find upon the Subject with Care , thought and studied on it with Attention ; wrote to my good Friend , Mr. John Bartram , 3 a Farmer in Pennsylvania , a Man of footnote 3 John Bartram , the Quaker naturalist , founder of a famous botanical garden in Philadelphia in 1718 . Bartram won from Linnaeus the praise of being " the greatest natural botanist in the world . " 4  | Worth , to know his Opinion of it . He judiciously observ 'd , that England , where it had been practised with Success , was an Island , having the Sea on all Sides , the Air must be filled with more Vapours and larger Dews , than what we enjoy upon the Continent ; their Atmosphere being much more replete with Riches for the Earth , than what is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , it ran strongly in my Head to try ; for I considered , that , as God had not left himself without Witness , in that he had given us Rain and fruitful Seasons , so , in some Degree , he hath given us the other Benefits of the Atmosphere , to fill our Hearts with Food and Gladness ; therefore thought it our Duty to take all the Advantage of it that we can ; and that we would try the Method as far as we could , without the proper Instruments , how much there was of Truth in the Doctrine or Principles , if used and applied in this Climate ; and so proceed , or forbear to get the Drill Plough , and other Instruments , as we should find Encouragement : Having made some Trials one Year , this leads rrie to the second Thing . 2 . To offer such Reasons and Proofs for the Support of those Principles , as did occur upon the one Year 's Trial which I made . After my Land was prepared and ploughed into Ridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Onions and Beets , and a Furrow ploughed off from each Side of the Ridge , and then ploughed on ; and this being repeated four or five Times from Spring to Fall , the Event was , the Weeds were killed , the Ground grew fine and mellow , Clods and Knots broken and reduced to Dust ; the Plants put out numerous Roots , spread and grew very finely ; all the Ground was mellow , not only the Furrows which were ploughed , but also the Comb or Ridge in the Middle , as it was narrow and so exposed to the Air and Dew on three Sides , it was struck through , grew mellow , and received as much Advantage by the Tillage , as that Part of the Ridge which was plowed off  | and on . The Land being ploughed deep , there was a great Quantity of fine Earth prepared to receive the Dews and Salts of the Air , and sufficient Room for the Roots to spread and branch out on all Sides , so that every Thing grew a-pace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the same Land would produce in the ordinary Way , Carrots no bigger than a common Candle ; in this there were many , 8 , io , and some 12 Inches of Circumference ; they were so large , that three Ridges of fifteen Rods long each , two Rows on a Ridge , produced more than twenty Bushels : So an whole Acre 's Product , yielding in the same Proportion , would be two hundred and thirty Bushels : had the three Ridges yielded no more than twenty Bushels , besides the greater Increase of the Crop , it is done cheap and with more Ease , as the HorsePlough performs the Work with more Expedition than it can be done by Hand , so it is done much better for the present Crop , and also mends and enricheth the Land , and prepares it for future Improvement . It is easier this Way , to raise five Bushels of Carrots than one in the common Way . I also tried this Method of Tillage with Turnips planted in a single Row ; by the Middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not weigh or measure them , I am not able to give a perfect Account of them . In a former Essay , I made mention of a Society in Scotland , consisting of three hundred Members , many of them Noblemen of the first Rank ; this Society was erected to promote Husbandry and Manufactures ; they published a Book of their Transactions ; by the Favour of Mr. Collinson of London , I had an Opportunity to read it , and find in their Fallow Year , instead of the old chargeable Way of Summer Fallow , they plough into Ridges , then plant Cabbages and Turnips ; their Cabbages and the early sort are ripe before the Time of sowing Wheat : With frequent Horse-ploughing they grow large , and the Land in fine order for sowing Wheat in the  | common Way . By this Means , they ' sometimes raise a Crop of great Value , and have their Land in better order for Wheat than in the old Way of fallowing their Land . The Lord Rea , observed to the Society , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the Rows of Cabbages grew before to be poor , but was surprized to find , that in the very Line where the Cabbages grew , in that Range was the biggest Wheat . One would expect that the Land would have been exhausted by so many large Plants . The true Reason of what appeared so strange , was this , the broad Leaves of Cabbage made a large Shade , and within that Shade there would be a swift Undulation of the Air , and consequently a Stream of the nitrous and sulphurous Particles of the Air , would be drawn in and lodged there ; I suppose by this Means , that Part of the Land became more inriched than the open Part of the Field . Pease are found to make Land mellow , to inrich , and so well to prepare it for Wheat , that , I have many Times known Farmers to invite others , who had Pease , to sow their Land without paying any Rent , meerly for the Advantage it would be to their Crop of Wheat . Pease make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be condensed , and , consequently , make room for the rushing in of more Air , so that in this Shade there will be a greater Lodgment of the nitrous Salts , and consequently the Land will be made rich . The same is found by Experience to be true of Potatoes , and therefore , it is accounted to be an inricher of Land . It has been found that Potatoes may be successively planted without Dung , and have good Crops . It will be asked , if so , why do not Weeds , which make Shades , inrich the Ground ? The Reason is plain , because the Land is not tilled , and so prepared to receive and retain the Dews and Salts of the Air : So turn it and set it in every Light , we shall see and find , that Tillage tends to inrich Land , and fits it to bring forth Fruit . My Carrots put forth such Num-  | bers of small fibrous Roots , for the Nourishment of the main Root , that when the Time came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hairy like a Rat . Roots are to Plants as the Mouth is to Animals ; therefore , in feeding Plants we have the greater Advantage : An Horse , Ox or Sheep , has but one Mouth ; provide as much Hay and Provender as you will , he can eat but such a Proportion ; if you give Benjamin 's Mess , five Times more than he can eat , it will do no good . But it is otherwise with Plants , the more Provision you make for them of good rich Mold , the more Roots will they put forth , take in so much the more Food , and consequently , grow so much the larger . Another Proof of the Truth of the Doctrine , or Principles , laid down as the Ground-Work or Basis of this new Husbandry , I shall borrow from the old Husbandry , in the Manner of raising Indian Corn . The Land being previously prepared , the Land Planted , and Corn come up , we plough a Furrow off from the Corn on each side , then hoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; so that this Tillage is nearly the same with what is now proposed for Wheat , or what ever we would plant : Only by the Way , I would observe , that the ploughing between the Rows is so shallow , as though they had nothing else in View and Design , but only to kill the Grass and Weeds ; whereas it is found by Experience , that if there be no Grass or Weeds , the ploughing and hoeing will make the Corn grow ; it is also found true by Experience , that the better the Land is ploughed and hoed , the better and longer will it bear the Drought , and better Crop there will be : Nay , what is still more remarkable , if the Indian Corn be well tilled , the next Crop , whether it be Oats or Flax , so much the bigger and better will that succeeding Crop be , so that the Land must have gained Strength and Riches : If it were not so , why did not the Indian Crop exhaust and spend the Strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | the Corn is made to grow by the good Tillage ? But we find the Contrary , the better the Crop of Indian , the better will be the Crop of Oats . There is no sort of Husbandry , wherein the superior Force and Virtue of Tillage doth so evidently appear , as in raising Indian Corn ; for if you should plough and harrow the best of Land , and sow or plant the Corn , and never do any Thing more to it , there will be less Corn than if you should plant poor Land , and tend it well ; the poor Land well ploughed and hoed , shall bring more Corn than the rich Land ; so that by this , we may see the Efficacy and Advantage of this repeated Tillage , which falls in successively , according to the Exigency and Want of the Plant in its several Degrees of Growth : This keeps the Land in a State of Tillage . It is hard to find a Reason why it should not have the same Effect upon Wheat , and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for every one knows , that without this Indian Corn , in good Land , will produce very little , and in poor Land , nothing at all . We have seen and experienced the Effect of this Kind of Tillage in Indian Corn all our Life , and yet never thought of applying the same Method to other Plants ; for we generally go on by Tradition , and do not enter into the Reason of Procedure . It is natural for Mankind to admire and be pleas 'd with new Things , without Reason , and to despise others without Sense or Judgment . The useless Tricks which Horses or Dogs are taught , are admired and valued , and the Instructor is looked upon as little less than a Conjurer ; whereas we daily see an Horse or Ox , with little Pains taught , when made fast to a Plough , to keep the Furrow without Variation ; and at the End of the Work , at a Word 's speaking , come about and return into his Work again . As this is ten Times more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What we see often we little regard .  | The Culture of Indian Corn , to a Man of Consideration and Reflection , holds forth much useful Instruction , and is a good Proof of those Principles we have now under Consideration . Having gone through the Consideration of the Proofs that do occur for the Support of the Doctrine or Principles on which we design to make Tryals , Third , I come now to direct the Performance of the Work with Instruments less intricate , more plain , cheap and commodious , than those directed to and described by Mr. Tull . Having found by Experience the Advantage of planting Seeds in Rows , and also finding that to plant by Hand is a slow and chargeable Way ; therefore I designed to use it no longer than was necessary to find , that it was likely the Method would answer the Design proposed : Being satisfied in that Point , the next Thing was to get Instruments suitable to the Work . The Instruments peculiar to this Husbandry , are Drill Ploughs . By a Drill I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a Ridge , and drop in the Seed at due Distances , and in a just Proportion : This is what it will do in better Order than Men can possibly do it with their ringers , and will do more in one Day , than One Hundred Men can do by Hand . There is not much Reason to call it a Plough , for there is no Affinity or Likeness between them but only in this , the Drill has two Coulters by which the Channels are cut . There are in Use several Sorts of Drills ; there is the Wheat Drill , the Turnip Drill , and divers others ; but these named are the Chief ; to which I have added a Dung Drill , by which Dung , Ashes , or any other Manure , may be conveyed into the Channels where the Seed is to be dropped . Mr. Tull 's Wheat Drill is a wonderful Invention , but it being the first invented of that kind , no Wonder if it be intricate , as indeed it is , and consists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really any Need of . This I was very sensible of all along , but knew not how to mend it , therefore applied myself to the Reverend Mr. Clap , President of Yale College , and desired him for the Regard which he had to the Publick and to me , that he would apply his mathematical Learning , and mechanical Genius , in that Affair ; which he did to so good Purpose , that this new modelled Drill can be made with a fourth Part of what Mr. Tull 's will cost . This I look upon as a great Improvement , and take this Opportunity to make my Acknowledgements for the Favour . When this Drill came home , I found the Wheels were too low for our Ridges , therefore it must be mounted upon new Wheels . The next Thing I wanted in order to compass my Design , was a Dung Drill ; this is an Invention intirely new , for which there was no Precedent or Model . For this I applied myself to Benoni Hylliard , a very ingenious Man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him what I wanted , and desired him to make one . At first we could think of no Way but to make it as a distinct Instrument : But at length his Ingenuity led him to set this and the Wheat Drill upon one Frame , so that it became one Instrument . Mr. Tull , it is true , might think this Drill not to be needful ; for he tells us , that he tried applying of Dung by Hand to the Channels , but found that this Assistance of Dung was not necessary : For he writes , that , to his great Surprize , he found that the Want of Dung might be supplied by repeated Horse-ploughings , and that Two Shillings in Horse-ploughing would do more than Forty Shillings in Dung . I should be glad , if in our Climate the One-half of this would prove true . The Land which I design to make use of , is so low and poor , that I shall have need enough of my DungDrill , at least , when I first begin with this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Land may be so inriched by Tillage , that this may prove needless . The Dung-Drill , exhibits or sheds into the Channel eighty  | Bushels of Dung to the Acre , which is about two Cart Loads ; the Board on the Fore-side of the Drill-Box , is made fast only by a Spring , so that if any Clod , Lump or Stone , can not pass through the Drill , the Fore-board opens and lets it out , and the Spring shuts it again : Thus the Danger of stopping or breaking the Drill is prevented . Wheat is planted in two Rows , but Turnips in one Row on the Middle of the Ridge . The Engine is so contrived , that the Wheat-Drill may be taken off , and a Turnip-Drill be put on ; and then the Dung-Drill can be so ordered , that the Dung shall be conveyed into that one Channel , either so much Dung as was shed into the two Channels , or half so much more or less as we please . The Hopper of the Wheat-Drill , holds about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half . Before we plant either Wheat or Turnips , the Tops of the Ridges must be harrowed and made smooth ; to do this , Mr. Tull used two Harrows at once , one upon one Ridge , and the other upon the next Ridge ; a Pole from the Out-side of each Harrow held them together , an Horse made fast to the Middle of the Pole , drew both Harrows : But instead of all this , we have a small Harrow on the Fore-part of the Frame , which first harrows the Ridge ; after the Harrow comes two Coulters , which makes the two Channels at ten Inches Distance ; The DungDrill fills these Channels with Dung ; then comes the two Coulters belonging to the Wheat-Drill , and opens the two Channels , and the Wheat-Drill drops in the Wheat Seed , half a Bushel to an Acre ; after this follows a small Harrow , which covers the Seed . There is a Tongue or Neb to go between the Oxen ; a long Yoak is used for this Work , so that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next , with the Ridge between : One Horse might draw it with Ease , could we find any Way to do it , and the Horse travel in the Furrow ; if the Horse walk upon the Ridge it would be hurtful.  | Mr. Tull 's Wheat-Drill , required two Pair of Wheels : We have two Drills fastened upon a Frame two Foot eight Inches square , and two Harrows , each performing its respective Part of Work at one Movement ; and to the Whole but one Pair of Wheels : The Shaft of the Dung-Drill carries round the Shaft of the Wheat-Drill by a Cogg-Wheel ; the several Parts are all plain Work , open and easy to the Understanding ; this I esteem a compendious Instrument . It has cost me a great deal more than it will to make another , Imitation being so much more easy than Invention . The next Instrument that was thought necessary for this Kind of Husbandry , is the Hoe-Plough , of which Mr. Tull has given us a Draught , which I shewed to our best PloughWrights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was almost discouraged : But at length I found a Way to do well enough , without any such strange-built Hoe-Plough : Nor is there any Manner of Difficulty about it , for the Furrows may be ploughed from , and up to the Ridges , with a common Plough , a Yoak of Oxen in a long Yoak , so that one Ox may go in one Furrow , and the other Ox in the other Furrow , and the Ridge between . Let the Plants be what they will , we can come as near to them as is needful ; or it may be done with one Horse , with an Horse-Plough ; but the Way with Oxen I like best , because there is sufficient Strength to plough deep , which is of great Importance , in order to raise a great deal of Mould , for the Purposes above-mentioned . What will be the Success of raising Wheat in this Method , will be left to Experience , and the History of that Trial to be communicated in another Essay . It is high Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheat , it is purchased at the new Towns , and these new Towns will be old in Time ; and then what shall we do unless some better Way can be found to manage our old Land which is plain and smooth ? For any Man 's Reason will tell him , that stony , rocky , rough Land ,  | is by no Means fit for this Sort of drilling Husbandry ; there is enough of such plain Land to produce a vast deal of Corn , could there be found any Way to make it bring forth good Crops . Mr. Tull saith , that the Wheat planted in this Manner is not subject to blast , therefore it is a Method that may enable those Parts of New-England , to raise Wheat , who never could , in ordinary , attain to it ; of this we can have no Certainty but by Trial . Another Instrument necessary in this Sort of Husbandry , is the Turnip-Drill : This is an Instrument which drops a single Turnip-Seed into a Channel cut for that Purpose on the Middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine is made to drop one at three Inches Distance , lest the Fly should destroy any of them , or any Seeds should fail coming up ; They should be six Inches Distance ; if they should be too thick , it is easy to cut them out . They raise Turnips in Abundance in England to feed Cattle ; some do it in the random Way of sowing , then where they are too thick hoe them up , till they are thinned to a proper Proportion ; but then they grow so close together , that it might be difficult and chargeable Work to do it : It is found by Experience , that this Way of Drilling , and tending them with the Horse-Plough , is , by far , the cheapest and most profitable Way . Mr. Tull saith , that his Turnips drilled and well ploughed , weighed from six Pounds to fourteen , did produce Six Hundred and Forty Bushels to the Acre : I should be very glad of half that Quantity : As to the Ease in raising them in this Method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am satisfied by Experience , and that they will grow larger ; what I tried were Spring Turnips . The Usefulness of Turnips for Cows when they calve , . for Winter Milch-Cows , is known to all those who have tried . To make a Turnip-Drill that will drop a single Seed and  | no more , is a nice Piece of Work . Any Thing farther relating to drilling and ploughing of Wheat and Turnips , must be referred to another Essay , when Time and Experience shall enable me . Summer Wheat standing so short a Time upon the Ground , to drill that will not be of Advantage . The raising Summer Wheat is a new Part of Husbandry , which obtains greatly of late ; and indeed it is Wisdom to have two Strings to the Bow , as was intimated in the Third Essay . As Summer Wheat requires so much Dung , which we can not well spare , I thought it might do well in the drained Swamps ; I have tried this Year , and it looks promising : There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; indeed it looks strange to see Wheat growing where not long since there was Flags and Mire ; this I suppose to be the first Wheat that ever was raised in such Land in New-England : I design to sow a considerable Piece the next Year . Most of the Summer Wheat which was raised last Year , was sold for Seed at a greater Price than Winter Wheat . But to return from this Digression . There are two Things which may be objected against the Theory or Principle laid clown ; it may be objected , that if repeated Ploughing will inrich Land ; whence is it then that Land is spent and impoverished by Indian Corn ? 1 . Indian Corn seldom is tended as it ought to be ; if there be any ploughing between the Rows it is shallow , just so as to kill Weeds , but not so as to make a great Quantity of soft mellow Earth . 2 . It is succeeded by Oats generally , which is a great Spunger , and this without Rest or Relief . 3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Land , and many Times for the Corn too . Look upon that Plant in Blossom Time , when it is in its full Pomp and Pride , observe its Height , its Breadth , its Ver-  | dure , that deep green shews it to be replete with rich Sap . A Man that spends more than his Income , altho ' that be very great , yet he will grow poor ; so in Land , if the Exhaustion be more than the Assistance it receives by Dung or Tillage , the Land will not gain but grow poor : That which is called hoeing scarce deserves the Name of Tillage , for really it is but scraping . I have had Thoughts of trying to plant Corn at a great Distance every Way , and plough deep every Time ; this , doubtless , would be better for the Land ; if the Crop were less , it may be , we should have a Compensation in the Advance of the Land . One of my Sons , upon this Sort of Reasoning , has planted his Corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper than what is common , so that will serve to make some Discovery . Another Objection is , that sandy Land seems to have all the needful Properties or Qualifications ; it is light , mellow , the Parts at due Distance , and there is Room for a Passage to the Roots ; and yet it is found that Sands are barren ; but this is where it is perfect Sand ; for it is found by Experience , that where Loam or Clay is mixed with Sand in a good Proportion , it proves the best of Land ; whether this Mixture be by Art , as in the Norfolk Husbandry , or if it be by a natural Mixture . No Fertility is to be expected from perfect Sand , for every Grain of Sand is a pebble Stone , and surely none can reasonably expect Corn from Stones alone , although these Stones lye in never such good Order : That a Grain of Sand is a Pebble , appears by being viewed in the Microscope or Magnifying Glass ; as also , that Sand is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have thought of these and other Objections , and have helped myself to get over them ; whether I have done so for the Reader , he can best tell ? I have two Things of great Importance to communicate ,  | with which I shall conclude this Essay . In the Fourth Essay , I informed the Reader , I was in Hopes , that I had found certain Times for cutting Bushes , which would be more effectual for their Destruction than any yet discovered ; that if I found it so , I would give Notice of it in my next ; am glad I am able to perform that Promise ; the Times are in the Months of June , July and August ; in the old Moon that Day the Sign is in the Heart : It will not always happen every Month ; it happens so but once this Year , and that proves to be on Sunday . Last Year in June or July , I forgot which , I sent a Man to make Trial ; in going to the Place , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going about , and the Reason of his going at that Point of Time , they also went to their Land , and cut Bushes also on that Day ; their 's were tall Bushes that had never been cut ; mine were short Bushes such as had been often cut , but to no Purpose , without it was to increase their Number : The Consequence was , that in every Place it killed so universally , that there is not left alive , scarce one in a hundred ; the Trial was made in three or four Places on that same Day . In July or August , on the critical Day , another Swamp was cut , the Brush was , the greatest Part of it , Swamp Button Wood , the most difficult to subdue of any Wood I know ; I have been lately to see it , and find the Destruction of these Bushes are not so universal as among Alders and other Sorts of Growth ; it is hard to say how many remain alive , it may be one third or a quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that they are now few , compared with what there was last Year : I did not know but that those which are alive , might be such as came up since ; but upon Examination , I found the last year 's Stumps , and could plainly see where they had been cut off ; this was not because the Season was better when there was such Suc- , cess ; for in this last mentioned Piece of Swamp , there were sundry Spots of Alders and other Sorts of Bushes , they seem  | to be as universally killed as those before mentioned : The Reason why there was not the same Success attending the cutting these Button Bushes as the other Sorts , I suppose to be from the stubborn Nature of this Kind , which would yield to no cutting ; the ordinary Way has been to dig or plough it up by the Roots ; so that considering the Nature of this Bush , I have had great Success ; the Ground being very boggy , those who mowed them , were obliged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To shew such a Regard to the Signs , may incur the Imputation of Ignorance or Superstition ; for the Learned know well enough , that the Division of the Zodiac into Twelve Signs , and the appropriating these to the several Parts of the animal Body , is not the Work of Nature , but of Art , contrived by Astronomers for Convenience . It is also as well known , that the Moon 's Attraction hath great Influence on all Fluids . It is also well known to Farmers , that there are Times when Bushes , if cut at such a Time , will universally die . A Regard to the Sign , as it serveth to point out and direct to the proper Time , so it becomes worthy of Observation . If Farmers attend the Time with Care , and employ Hands on those Days , they will find their Account in it . This Rule attended to , may save the Country many Thousand Days Work . A Farmer of good Credit told me , that he had found by Experience , that Bushes cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut with a dull one . This looks agreeable to Reason , for the sharp Scythe leaves the Mouths of the Sap Vessels all open by which Means they bleed more plentifully : The dull Instrument bruizes the Part , and in a Degree doth close up the Wound . Another important Article , is concerning red Clover Seed . It hath been the prevailing Opinion of Farmers in this Country , that Clover Seed must be laid very shallow in the Ground ;  | and by the Books of Husbandry , their Opinion and Practice is the same in England . It hath been said , that no Harrow must be used after the Seed is sown : Nay it has been thought , that if the Ground was mellow , that the Seed would sink too deep in the Earth , and never come up . The constant Lesson was , take Heed you do not bury your Clover Seed too deep . But we have gone upon mistaken Principles : By Experience it is found , that the best Way is to plough in the Seed , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the Practice in those Towns where they have raised Clover with great Success , and sold the Seed with such great Profit and Advantage . A Farmer in this Town sows and ploughs in his Clover Seed in this Manner ; has upon the Ground sundry Acres ordered in this Manner ; it was sowed this last Spring , finds no Difficulty attending to it as to its coming up . Shallow sowing has been very detrimental , attended with great Loss when a dry Season follows soon upon it ; whereas this Danger is prevented by sowing deep : I have sustained Loss by sowing shallow , which , according to the old Rule , was tho't necessary : There is the Loss of Seed , and Profit of the Land , which is more than the Loss of a Crop of Corn . Besides the Advantage we have by deep sowing of Clover Seed , to secure it in Time of early Drought , there is another great Benefit arising from it : The Seed being lodged so deep , it will be well fed and nourished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meerly wallows in Wealth ; so that the Grass grows strong and large . I suppose this to be the Reason that the Clover Seed which we have from those Parts where they bury their Seed so deep , is so much better than ours , which springs from shallow sowed Clover : Their Seed is a larger Seed than what we raise , and the Grass is larger too ; Their Seed looks plump and well fed . The supreme Ruler of the Universe takes Care of the whole Race of Mankind . His Goodness , in a special Manner ,  | meets us with Instruction , and lays it in our Way , that we may find it in our ordinary Vocation , for our Profit and Improvements , whether it be Merchandise or Farming . The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a Merchant-Man seeking goodly Pearls , who , when he had found one Pearl of great Price , he went and sold all that he had and bought it . Mat. xiii . 45 , 46 . Judah shall plough , and Jacob shall break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercy , break up your fallow ground , for it is Time to seek the Lord , till he shall come to rain Righteousness upon you . Hosea x. 11 , 12.  | The Tree of the Field is Man 's Life . Deut. xx . 20 . Fruitful Trees and all Cedars , praise the Lord . Psal. cxlviii. 9 . I planted me Vineyards , and made me Gardens and Orchards , and I planted Trees in them of all Kind of Fruits . Eccl. ii . 4 , 5 . WHEN I first apply 'd myself to the writing Essays upon Field-Husbandry , I did not expect those small Tracts , calculated to our Soil , Meridian , and Climate , would ever extend farther than to a small Circle of Neighbours ; but , they having found the Way to England , and being approved of there ; and the Design being encouraged by Gentlemen of great Worth , who were so good as to send me over a great Variety of Seeds , both of Grass , and Grain , and to favour me with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad , and at home , I designed to go on , to publish an Essay , on that Subject , yearly ; but , the War coming on , which naturally and necessarily engaged our Attention , both in the dark and bright Scenes of it , so as to leave but little Room for any Thing , but what is absolutely necessary , and especially so , as we are all military Men , as well as Farmers , our Circumstances being like that of the old Romans , from the Plow to the War , and from the War to the Plow again ; there having been so many of our labouring People draughted out yearly , ever since the Commencement of the War , no less than Five Thousand the last Year , besides lesser Excursions , which takes off Men from their husbandry Business ; which , together  | with heavy Charges consequent upon it , renders it neither safe nor prudent , to leave the old beaten Paths , for new Inventions , for , having neither Hands nor Money to spare , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have given over writing ; unless it be something that can be done in a little Time , and with a very small Expence , the Advantage of which may be of long Continuance , and of great Benefit , such as planting of Fruit-Trees , and other useful Trees : As Trees are soon planted , but take a considerable Time before they come to Maturity , it may be very proper , even , altho ' the War yet continue , to set ourselves about it with due Application . I shall begin with the Mulberry-Tree ; as we have but few of this Kind , the planting great Numbers of them is a Subject of great Importance , and is a Part of Husbandry that will be much to our Honour , and Advantage ; for the Land we improve this Way will become more useful and profitable to ourselves , and Posterity , and render us more serviceable to our Mother-Country , and gain their Attention , Esteem , and Regard ; as will appear by the Transactions of The Society established at London , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This Society have offered Premiums for the Encouragement of many Things , very useful , both at home , and in the Plantations , in North-America ; have pointed out Georgia , Pennsylvania and Connecticut for the Production of Silk , and have offered Premiums for Encouragement ; but this Matter will stand in a much better Light , and carry with it more Weight , if I cite their own Words ; the Society say : That the Production of Silk in our American Colonies , being undoubtedly a proper Object of Encouragement , as it must tend greatly to the Advantage of those Colonies , and prove highly beneficial to the Mother-Country , by promot ing a very valuable Branch of its Manufacture ; in order to forward the same , by such Bounties as may operate in equal  | Proportion , to the Benefit of the poorest , as well as the rich est Planter , the Society propose to give , for every Pound Weight of Cocoons , produced in the Province of Connecti ' cut , in the Year 1759 , of an hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only has spun , Three Pence , for every Pound Weight of Cocoons , produced in the same Year , wherein two Worms are interwoven , One Penny . N.B. These Premiums will be paid under the Direction of the Rev. Mr. Thomas Clap , and Dr. Jared Eliot , of Con necticut , on Condition that a publick Filature 1 be established in Connecticut , under Direction of the said Gentle men , that each Person bring his or her Balls , or Cocoons , to such publick Filature . ' This generous Offer , of this honourable Society , ( those true Patriots ) finds us , of this Colony , not so fully prepar 'd , by Reason of the Scarcity of Mulberry Trees , to take all the Advantage of such a noble Encouragement as they and we could wish ; so that we must crave their Patience , till we are prepar 'd , to reap the Advantage , and more fully answer their reasonable Expectation . This Invitation is not to a Business to which we are wholly Strangers , it is not to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has been something of this Manufactory carried on for sundry Years , and by a Number of our People , in divers of our Towns , by which we are assur 'd that it is practicable . So those who do not understand the Manner of breeding and feeding Silk Worms , may easily attain the Skill from those , who by long Practice are enabled to inform them ; for , indeed , that Part is very easy ; the winding of the Balls is more difficult , but this is to be performed by those who have more Skill , and who by long Use , and being well furnished with proper Engines and Implements for that Service , can do it better , and in less Time . Thus , being freed from this more footnote 1 A reel for drawing off silk from cocoons.  | intricate and difficult Part of the Work , we may give our whole Attention to the feeding the Worms , till the Silk Balls are completed , which are then to be carried to the Filature , or Silk House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be very much to our Advantage ; for , the Silk Balls must be wound off in a little Time after they are formed ; which , if neglected too long , the Silk will not be so good , when it is manufactur 'd , the Threads will be uneven , as if full of small Knots , nor will it appear with equal Lustre and Brightness , this I know by certain Experience ; and farther , the winding of the first Crop of Silk Balls will be an Hindrance to the raising a second Stock of Silk , which , I suppose , the Length of our Summers will well admit of : It is design 'd that the next Season shall determine that Point , and render that certain , which , at present , is but probable . If we were furnished with a sufficient Number of Mulberry Trees , conveniently planted , this Colony , which is so populous , might produce a vast Number of Silk Balls . The Colony of Georgia which is so new and small , hath advanced greatly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loss they sustain 'd the last Year ; their Filature , or Store-House for Silk , unhappily taking Fire , was consumed , together with a Quantity of raw Silk , and ( if I remember right ) Eight Thousand Weight of Cocoons , or Silk Balls . If they had Hands , and Trees sufficient , they might increase from Eighty Thousand , to an Hundred Thousand ; this is a Production that may be enlarged , and carried to what Height we please ; and Providence favouring our Labours ; it may be extended in Proportion to our Want of Returns , for Goods we draw from Great Britain . A little Ground , planted with Mulberry Trees , under prudent Management , would afford Leaves for feeding a great Number of Silk Worms . Capt . Meigs , in my Neighbourhood , has but two Trees , which are , by Measure , but three Feet and four Inches in Girt , or , as we commonly say , about a Foot  | over , each ; these two Trees , he tells me , will afford Leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four Thousand Silk Worms . That , as far as Experience in little Essays will enable a Person to judge of greater Works of the same Kind , he makes no Question , but that where the Trees are near , one Person can feed and tend One Hundred Thousand Worms thro ' the whole Season , from the Time of hatching , to the Time of winding up , which is six Weeks . The Family , which I have been speaking of , have made Silk many Years , so far as two Trees would enable them , for their own Use ; Knowledge and Experience , altho ' it be of Things in Miniature , yet is very valuable , from which many Consequences of great Importance may be drawn , with a good Degree of Certainty . As I have turned my Thoughts on this Subject of making Silk , I had a Fear which sat very heavy upon me , which seem 'd to be an insuperable Difficulty ; which was , that robbing the Trees of their Leaves yearly , would first distemper , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continual Round of planting and destroying , to our great Discouragement . For , as there is an analogical Agreement between Vegetables and Animals , as the faeculent Matter , Impurities of the Blood , and other Juices , which are not fit for Nourishment , are cast out by the Guts , or carried off by Perspiration , by the Lungs , and thro ' the Skin , from the Body of Man and Beast ; so the Impurities of the Sap of Trees , and other Plants , exude thro ' the Bark , and more abundantly are cast off by the Leaves : If a Tree become hide-bound , and overgrown with Moss , the Tree will not thrive ; if the Leaves of Trees , or Bushes , are constantly stripped off , or cropped by Goats or other Cattle , the Plant will die . It has been found by Experience , that a Branch of a Tree put into a Retort , or large wide mouth 'd Bottle , and luted , or  | stopped up from the Air , after a while , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thick slimy ropy Matter ; this gross foul Matter being shut up , and retained in the Mass of the Sap , and finding no Vent , the Leaves being plucked off , the Tree will be strangled and die ; so that , as a learned Man has observ 'd , one great Difference between Plants and Animals is , that the Lungs and Guts of Animals are found in the Inside ; and in Plants or Trees , they are on the Outside . After I had resolved these Things in my Mind , I informed Mr. Meigs of my Doubts and Fears on this Head , ( he being a judicious and observing man ) I desired him to give me his Opinion on that Particular ; to which he reply 'd , that there was indeed a great deal of Danger ; that Prudence and Caution was necessary ; that we must not be too eager at first , nor deprive the Tree of its Leaves very much , at our first Entrance on that Work ; and must use Moderation for a Time , till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( as his Phrase was ) the Tree was used to it , we may then grow bold , and use a greater Freedom . He told me , that by an Error of this Kind , he had destroyed a fine young Tree ; that his Trees would bear the Hardships now , which would have been destructive in the Beginning . This was a Doctrine I did not understand , I knew that Man and Beast might by Habit and Custom be enured to bear Hunger and Thirst , Heat , Cold , and Nakedness , beyond what is common ; but the Application of this , to Trees , was to me quite unintelligible ; going out abroad , the Sight of the Trees unveiled the Mystery ; I observ 'd that the Tops of the Trees and Branches were thick set with small Twigs , like Fringes , and huddled together in a confused Manner : It filled me with Wonder , to see the wise Provision of Nature reduced to Extremity , occasion 'd by picking away the Leaves ; the Sap thrusting on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leaves being taken away ) was under the hard Necessity  | of putting out new Leaves , and small Sprigs . If you give the Tree Time , there will be this Provision , if you drive too fast you spoil the Tree . I must confess , this is all new Philosophy to me , and opens a new Scene of Wonders ; and is the more pleasing , as it has a favourable Aspect upon the Silk Manufactory . The Reader may think that I have dwelt too long on such a minute Article , perhaps I have ; but if he is willing to forego his Time and Pains , to save the Life of one Mulberry Tree , I am willing to give mine . As the Society , established at London , have offered such Encouragement , and have so kindly invited us to apply ourselves to the raising Silk ; Gratitude and Interest obliges us to improve such a favourable Opportunity ; more especially , as they have display 'd such Wisdom , Goodness , and Care , in the Offer of their Favour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suitable to make an immediate and direct Return to England , for such Goods as we want , and must always want more abundantly than we have Means at present , by which we can refund : This seems to be the State of Georgia , Pennsylvania , and Connecticut . The Colony of Carolina is in Possession of a good and valuable Staple ; their Rice and Indigo . Virginia and Maryland have for a long Time enjoyed the large Tobacco Trade ; the Province of New-York is well situated for , and has been enriched by the Furr Trade ; and Eastern Governments have well , within their Reach , the Advantage of such a Fishery , as has been very profitable , and may , in Time of Peace , prove more valuable than the richest Mines of Silver and Gold , when they shall quietly enjoy the best Fishing Ground in the known World . The People of this Colony have a Trade to the British Sugar Islands ; a coasting , continent , plantation Trade , which is to the Increase of Shipping , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circular Course , and in the End , centers in  | Great-Britain , and is of some Advantage ; yet , after all , something is wanting , by which we may have a direct Trade to England ; the Society has pointed out the Way and Means . The Colony of Georgia , I presume , would not continue , and increase their Silk Trade , if they did not find it a profitable Branch of Business ; doubtless they find their Account in it . Those , among us , who raise Silk , say , that it is more profitable than other ordinary Business . As this Affair has been the Subject of my Thought and Enquiry , as I had Opportunity , so I should have enquired much more , if I had then thought of writing upon that Article . Some Years past , I asked a Man of good Faith and Credit , who had then made the most Silk of any among us , what Profit might be made of it ; his Reply was , that he could make a Yard of Silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cloth , of eight Run to the Pound ; but moving into a new Town , where there were no Mulberry Trees , he was obliged to desist ; a Woman of Experience in this Business , told me , that , in the short Time of feeding the Worms , and winding the Silk Balls , she could earn enough to hire a good Spinner the Whole Year : I have not the least Scruple of the Informer 's Veracity , but how far their Capacity might serve for an exact Calculation I know not . There are some People that care for none of these Things , that will enter into no new Scheme , nor take up any other Business than what they have been enured to , unless you can promise Mountains of Gold , and that the Colony that engages in it shall immediately be turned to Lubber-Land . I trust that there are many among us , excited , with a Prospect of reasonable Gain to themselves and their Posterity , of doing publick Service to the Colony , and what may be useful and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vigour and Application , set forward in that Affair , to which we are so kindly invited and encouraged .  | We labour under such Difficulties to make Returns for Goods imported , that many have thought it would be best that we should make our own Clothes , and by this Means lessen our Importation , which , indeed , would be better than to run into an endless and irrecoverable Debt ; but this would make us less useful to England , from whom we derive ; and from whom we have receiv 'd such Favours and Assistance , when we were surrounded by our encroaching Enemies , who were edgging down upon us , erecting Forts , and destroying our 's ; but as there is a Way now open 'd for us , by which , if we are not wanting to ourselves , we may not only continue , but increase our Importation ; for , if the same Cost , Labour , and Time , which we expend in making one Yard of Cloth , if laid out in raising Silk , will procure two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by more skilful Hands , it is easy to see which is the most eligible Method ; certainly that Course which will best serve our own Purpose , and render us more useful to the Community , is to be chosen . There are several Things to be considered that highly recommend this Proposal to our Acceptance . i . That the Production of Silk , even tho ' it should be carried to a great Height , will not , in the least Degree , hinder our Husbandry . Communities have been many Times much hurt , by calling off the able bodied Men from Husbandry , to be employed in Mines , Manufactories , or other Works ; this has bro't on Famine and Ruin . The raising Silk may , in all its Parts , be performed by Women , Children , Cripples , and aged Persons ; Boys may be employed in climbing the Trees , to gather Leaves , Women and Girls may feed the Worms , he that has the Use but of one Hand can do Good , the Aged , those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear the Burthen and Heat of the Day , and have but little Remains of Strength , may find a . Pleasure in this easy Employment , their Prudence and Care is necessary in the well order-  | ing the Matter , taking Care of the Children , who are prone to Inadvertency and Idleness , and to see that the Worms are sufficiently fed , and have their Meat in due Season ; for tho ' the Work is easy , yet there is great Need of Attention and Care , that they have Air , and that the Worms are kept clean ; for the Excrement , altho ' it be as dry as Dust , must be swept off , and cleansed away . This may serve to alleviate much of the Uneasiness of old Age , for there is nothing sits so heavy upon the Aged , except Thoughts of an ill-spent Life , as the Doubts and Fears of being useless , and burthensome , or of being like a Lamp put out : There are also some , who are of such a tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature or Accident , that renders them utterly incapable of hard and laborious Service , who would be glad to take Refuge in an Employment so well suited to their State and Circumstances ; that so they need not hang as a dead Weight upon their Relations , or the Community . 2 . This Affair may be of great Advantage to the Poor , affording them Employment at Home , or abroad , as it requires no Stock to set up with , except Virtue and Diligence ; other Business needs so much for Stock , that many can not reach it ; but , for this Business there is nothing wanting but the Spawns , or Eggs of the Worm , a Chamber or Garret for their Reception , and Mulberry Leaves for Food : There are few among us but what have some Land , and consequently may have some Trees , but if they have none , when these Trees will be as plentiful as they should be , that Person is an hard Man indeed , that will deny a poor Neighbour a few Leaves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Wind . 3 . Another Advantage , attending this Business , is , that if we raise never so much , there is no Danger of over stocking the Market ; which will be evident to any who consider the great Importation of wro't , and unwro't Silk , into Great Britain ,  | from Persia , and Italy , ( some Years from Piedmont only , to the yearly Value of Two Hundred Thousand Pounds Sterling , ) and the vast Numbers of People in England employed in that Manufactory . Dr. Burnet informs us , that in the Reign of Queen Anne , there were no less than Three Hundred Thousand , employed in that Branch of Business ; and I have been informed it is still increasing . A sufficient and invariable Market , and to one Port , is a great Advantage ; Virginia finds it so , even tho ' their Tobacco is but one Penny per Pound , to the Planter : It is not so with Regard to our Product , which is principally Provisions , we glut the Markets every where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can come at it by Land , we run , ride , and drive , till we have overstocked it ; by Sea we are all afloat , sailing till Provisions may be purchased cheaper there , than at home . Not long since , I took Notice of a Dissertation , in one of the Magazines ; the general Design of that Piece was , to shew ; that the extensive , uninhabited , Parts of North-America ought to be so planned , and settled , that every Planter should have several Thousand Acres of Land , to enable him to become useful ; and that this is the sure Way to render those Countries eminently beneficial , to our Mother Country . He observes , that New-England , as to their Manner of Settlement , Course of Business , Way of living together in Towns , being similar to that of England ; therefore he concludes , that we can be but of little Service to Great-Britain . I must take Leave , to differ from that polite Writer , and retain a good Opinion of our Tenure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into small Freeholds ; as it is an arduous Work , to clear Land , overgrown with Wood , and drain Land , immerged in Water , and bring it into a State of Fertility ; and as nothing will inspire Men with Resolution , to undertake , and Patience , to persevere , like the Pleasure , and Advantage , of having a Right to call it their own .  | When People have a clear Prospect of Support for a Family , they will marry young ; which soon fills a Country , and renders them able , in a little Time , to plant a new Colony , as large as their own : This Advantage , in Manner of settling together , with the Obligation that all are under to enroll their Deeds of Land , makes the old Proverb truly availing . Buyer look to . These Advantages have greatly contributed to the Increase of People . When there is such an Increase of those who are under Circumstances to get a living ; they can , and must , increase the trade of Great-Britain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of People is the King 's Honour ; but , in the Want of People is the Destruction of the Prince . A Collection of People , in Towns , gives Opportunity for the Exercise of social Virtues , are under Advantage to enjoy the Privileges of Society , Schools , for the Education of Children , Colleges , for those who are designed for a liberal Education ; Arts and Sciences flourish , Trade , and Tradesmen , increase , a wild and savage Behaviour is put out of Countenance ; as there are no cross Purposes , or Contradictions in true Policy , so it is not to be imagined , that in order to be politically useful , we must be divested of so many Privileges of Society ; especially the Benefit of social Worship : These are Advantages not ordinarily enjoyed , in stragling , scattered , distant Settlements . Virtue , and Order , is the true Basis of every valuable , and lasting Establishment , of a political Nature . As to the other Method , of settling thin , upon large Tracts of Land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide and extensive Territory , in order to render it useful to GreatBritain ; it has been found by Experience , that a very large , private Property , has been a great Hindrance , to the peopling of those Parts of the Country , where such Lands lie : Is not only an Hindrance to the peopling , but also to the Improvement of such Land , and tends to continue it in a wilderness  | State ; unless Slaves , and transported Servants , are introduced to subdue , and improve it ; by these Helps , a great deal of Product , fit for Exportation may be raised , and sent to England . But , as Slaves spent but little , there will not be a proportionable Demand for English Goods . It is expected , that what we send , should be in Return for Goods : People of a free Condition , live at an higher Rate , spend more , and consequently their Demand for Goods will be larger : If these free People raise , and export , so much , as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful to the Mother Country : Farther , these bought Servants , and Slaves , as they are not constitutional Members of the Common Wealth ; so they can not be rely 'd on , in a Time of common Danger . But , Love for my Country , and a Zeal for its Honour , when represented as insignificant now , and like to be so for ever , has carried me much beyond my proper Bounds , and my first Intention . As we are now of some Advantage , so I can not but hope , that by our Fishery , raising Silk , and Wine , in Time , we shall become more abundantly useful to those , from whom we derive our Original . To this End , as we have but few Mulberry Trees , we should increase the Number , and as soon as possible . There are two Sorts of these Trees , whose Leaves are used for the Food of Silk Worms ; that , which bears the black Mulberry , the other which produces a white Berry : If they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are easily reconciled to our Climate ; for they are propagated without Difficulty , and grow freely without Culture , or much Care , except securing from the Cattle , while they are young , and within Reach : They may be propagated several Ways ; by Seeds , for a Nursery , in the same Way we use to procure-Apple Trees ; but , I suppose , that instead of scattering the whole Mulberries , in the Bed of prepared Earth , it will be better , to dry the ripe  | Mulberries and break them in Pieces , which may prevent their growing and coming up in thick Clusters , as , I am told , they will do when planted whole : When these are grown of sufficient Bigness , they must be transplanted ; or , they be planted by the Side of a Fence , by which Means they will grow up to an Hedge Row , and so never need transplanting , which will save Time and Labour , as also be of Advantage to the Tree ; for transplanting retards the Growth for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , by Layers , as it is called ; that is , they bend a Branch to the Earth , and bury a Part in the Ground ; in two Years it will have taken Root and may be transplanted : This Method of Propagation is attended with more Labour ; all that makes it preferable to any other , is , that hereby we may be certain of female bearing Trees ; if we have them from the Seed , they prove all , or many of them , male Plants , which bear no Fruit . A third Way of propagating the black Mulberry Tree , is , by digging up the young Trees , where-ever we can find them , as they grow here and there spontaneously ; bring them home , and plant them in convenient Places , near our Houses , where they will stand the most handy , for feeding the Silk Worms : Also , I have seen young Suckers , growing from the Roots of Trees , cut down ; which , if sever 'd from the Stump , with some Roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trees . I have been informed , that , at a Place called Falkner 's Island , which lyeth opposite to Guilford , there are vast Numbers of young Shoots , which grow with such Eagerness , and Obstinacy , that , notwithstanding all Endeavours to destroy them , the utmost Efforts of the Proprietors of the Island , both by Plow and Scythe , has been used successively many Years , as good Hap luck is , without being able to accomplish . it . A Number of us here , and in the neighbouring Towns , ( with Leave of the Owners ) design to supply ourselves from thence ,  | the next Spring ; for , I apprehend that this Way of transplanting young Trees , will be the most expeditious , to get furnished for the Silk Trade . A fourth Way of procuring Trees , is , by Slips , thrust in the Ground : I am inform 'd , that , if the Twigs , or small Branches , of the white Mulberry , are set in the Ground , altho ' they have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mile out of my Way , to see a Tree that was propagated in this Manner ; the Owner of it bro't it home with him as a riding Whip , and , as he was directed , set it in the Ground , and in six Years Time it was become a fine Tree , I suppose , would afford Leaves to feed a Thousand Worms , or more ; it is possible that the black Mulberry may be propagated in the same Manner ; if so , it will be the easiest Thing in the World to have what Number of them we please : If I live , I design , in the Spring , to set many Slips of the white Mulberry , and a few of the black Sort , for a Trial ; I apprehend that it will be a good Thing to dig the Ground , and make it mellow , where you design to set the Slips of black Mulberries , and to water them , if there should come a dry Time , before they have taken Root ; as all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Consequences are so interesting , I can not but hope , that many will apply themselves to it , notwithstanding the present State of Affairs . It is a disputable Point , whether the black Mulberry Leaves , or the white , are the best for Silk , but it is certain , either will do well ; it will be best to plant of both Sorts , that so Experience may determine the Question . We will see what the learned Miller writes on that Subject . ' The white Mulberry , is commonly cultivated for its ' Leaves , to feed the Silk Worms , in France and Italy , tho ' ' the Persians always make Use of the common black Mul ' berry , for that Purpose ; and I have been assured , by a Gen ' tleman of Honour , that hath made Trial of both Sorts of ' Leaves , that the Worms fed with those of the black Sort ,  | produce much better Silk , than those fed with the white ; ' but he observes , that the Leaves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after they have eaten for some ' Time of the white , lest the Worms should burst ; which is often the Case , when they are so treated . ' By this it seems , that the Worms like the Leaves of the black Mulberry the best , since they devour them so greedily . He farther adds , that the Trees designed to feed the Silk Worms , should not be suffered to grow tall , but rather be kept low like an Hedge ; and that , instead of pulling off the Leaves singly , they should be sheared off together with the young Branches , which is much sooner done , and not so in ' jurious to the Tree ; this Way is much more convenient , and easy , then climbing tall Trees , to gather Leaves . ' This Quotation is from Miller 's Gardener 's Dictionary , the Possession of which valuable Book is by the Favour of the learned Richard Jackson , Esq ; of London , who will be pleased with having afforded us Instruction , in such a Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nomination , and has been most in Vogue , in Conversation on this Subject ; but whether this Preference is derived from Tradition , or from Experience , I can not tell ; having seen no Silk of our own Production , but what was from the black Mulberry . These Worms will feed freely on Lettice , and the Leaves of other Plants ; but , being thus fed , it is said , that they will yield no Silk . Having considered the Subject of planting Mulberry Trees , as absolutely and essentially necessary , for the Support of the Silk Manufactory , as being the grand Object in View ; I proceed to offer collateral Considerations , to induce to a vigorous Prosecution of that useful Work . i . That we may order the planting Mulberry Trees , in such Manner , that they shall spoil no Land , nor in the least  | prejudice our other Productions , if we only avoid planting them in our Fields , that we design for Plowing and Tillage , where they will do Hurt by shading the Ground ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or no Harm , as we see by our Orchards , where we have good Grass , notwithstanding the Apple Trees , ( if they are not set too thick for our Advantage , considered as an Orchard , which is too often done , to the great Hurt of the Trees , the Fruit , and the Grass. ) 2 . We are to consider , that , Mulberry Trees planted in great Numbers , will afford us a Supply of Fire Wood , which is much wanted in our old Towns ; and in our present Course of Husbandry , our new Towns will , in Time , be involved in the same Calamity , and be obliged to fetch Wood three , four , or five Miles ; as Land Carriage is chargeable , it has brought Fire Wood to be an heavy Article in Life , and it is an increasing Burthen ; if therefore we plant our Pasture Ground with Mulberry Trees , at about forty Feet Distance , especially those Lands which are dry and poor , they would yield more Grass , than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme Force of the Sun 's Rays ; in Shade there is a Condensation of the Air , and as the Air under a Tree is crouded into less Room , so the ambient Air , which is lighter and thin , it continually rusheth in , which is the Reason of that Undulation , or gentle Motion of Air , which we feel in a hot still Day , while we stand under a large shady Tree ; in this Shade the Air will be cool and moist , which serves to promote the Growth of Grass ; as there is a greater and more extensive condensing of the Air in the Night , so there is a still greater Degree of Coolness and Moisture , which we call Dew ; every one knows how much this contributes to the Growth of Grass , in our Southern Colonies , where the Land is richer than our 's , yet it will not produce Grass equal to our 's , in these Northern Colonies ; I have been told , that the Land at Cape-Breton yields more Grass than our 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is no English Grass , nor will it grow , or abide , if sown . I have observ 'd , that in my dry , poor Pastures , where there are some Apple Trees growing here and there , there grows more grass under these Trees , than in the same Extent of Ground , where it is all open and exposed to the Sun ; is the Grass under the Trees sour , so , that the Cattle will not feed upon it at one Season of the Year ? yet they will at another Time , so that we shall certainly have the Benefit of it . Many Years past , I saw People on Rhode-Island , planting their Pasture Land with Button Wood , and Locust Trees ; it is high Time we should make the same wise Provision , ? and be even wiser , than they , in the Choice of our Trees ; let our 's be Mulberry Trees , which are , upon all Accounts , preferable , for , besides the Leaves for Silk , I know by Experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by certain Experience , that the white Mulberry will grow from Slips or Twigs , thrust into the Ground ; and it is probable , that the black Mulberry may be propagated in the same , easy Manner , so that we may soon raise large Plantations of these Trees . 3 . Another good Property in this Tree is , that it affords very durable Timber ; as to this good Quality I can say nothing from my own Experience , but I have been informed , that it will last , when exposed to all Weathers , as long as red Cedar . One of our Boat-Men told me , that he once carried some Mulberry Timber to New-York , the People there told him , that it was as good as red Cedar , and gave him a Price accordingly . If it be as durable as red Cedar , it is preferable to it , being a much stronger Wood , more solid and firm ; red Cedar is a weak , brittle Timber . The Masters of Vessels- that coast it to the Southern Colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they use it as Ship-Timber , and value it  | much for that Purpose . How useful must this Timber be for Window Frames and Caps , for Gate Posts , for Board-Fence , and indeed for all Sorts of Work exposed to the Weather ? This Timber may be very useful to the Joiner , for Cabinets , Chests of Drawers , and Tables , as it is of a fine yellow Colour , something resembling Manchineel. 4 . They are worth planting for Shade , Ornament and Beauty ; Trees planted in a Line , and at proper Distances , makes a very beautiful Appearance . In Italy , where they raise so much Silk , in planting Mulberry Trees , they not only consult their Profit , but their Pleasure too ; for Travellers say , that all the Road from Verona to Padua , is extremely pleasant , being planted with white Mulberry Trees , in fine Ranges on each Side the Way , which charms and diverts in a very pleasing Manner . If a Row of Mulberry Trees were planted on each Side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this be to the Sight , and how useful to all ? This might be done at the publick Expence , or by Agreement , each Man planting a Range as far as his Lot extends . I observ 'd at New-Haven , they have planted a Range of Trees all round their Market Place , and secured them from the Ravage of Beasts : This was an Undertaking truly generous and laudable ; it is a Pity these were not Mulberry , instead of Button Wood , and Elm : As there is Room sufficient , I hope the publick Spirit , by which they were animated before , will excite them to plant a Range or two of Mulberry Trees , within the Circuit . 5 . The planting of Mulberry Trees thick , for a quick Hedge , or live Fence , may be many Ways highly advantageous ; for the Situation and State of a great deal of the Land in this Colony is such , that , having neither Stone or Timber at any portable Distance , it must lie waste , as I see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Timber fails , this Difficulty must increase ; naked Ditches , without any Hedge Row ,  | will not answer ; make a Ditch in sandy Land , the Contexture of the Earth is so loose , that the Bank will soon run down , and fill the Ditch to such a Degree , as to render the Fence insufficient . In Clay Land the Frost will break the Cohesion of the Parts of such Earth , and the Rains will wash it down . To prepare the Ground for an Hedge Row , only plow two Furrows , ( four will be better ) in plowing , lay these Furrows as high as you can , by this Means you collect a good Body of top Earth , upon which plant the Twigs or Slips of white Mulberry Trees ; Apple Trees , planted on such a Bank , makes an impenetrable Fence ; Mulberry Trees have never yet , been try 'd , that I have heard of , but it looks highly probable that it will do well , for I have observ 'd , that those Sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best for Hedge Rows , as it better bears plashing * or lopping , for that Wood which will grow from Slips , will live , when there is but little Remainder of Wood and Bark left . When Mulberry Wood , by plashing , is kept low , and made to grow thick , it will render the gathering the Leaves , to feed the Silk Worms , much more easy and convenient ; when a Boy goes to Pasture with the Cows , he may bring with him a Bag or Basket of Leaves , so that the Worms may be supply 'd with Leaves , at a Mile 's Distance , as cheap , except the Carriage , as if they grew at home , which is an Advantage ; for every one hath not Room at home , for Trees to grow on . 6 . Another Advantage , which we may expect from Mulberry Trees , is the Fruit ; the white Mulberry Tree bears abundance more Fruit , than the black ; in Italy , where they abound in these Trees , they fatten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , that the Pork raised in this Manner , is exceeding good ; what is made by this Means costs footnote * " Plashing , " is chopping a young Tree about half thro ' at a proper Heighth , and bending it down horizontally , along the Fence ; in a short Time it will grow in that Position , and may form a living Fence .  | nothing , for the Hogs are their own Carvers ; the Flesh raised this Way , is a clear Gain , like our Wood fed Pork . I apprehend that a better Improvement of the Fruit would be , to make artificial Wine ; what is now made in the Country is from Cherries , and Currants ; but , as this Fruit is sour , it requires a great deal cif- Sugar to make it good , which is an heavy Weight upon that Manufacture ; but as the Juice of Mulberries is very sweet , especially the white Sort , I can not but think , that from these , very good artificial Wine may be made , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet has a spiritous Strength , in Proportion to the Degree of Sweetness ; Honey will make strong Metheglin , and Molasses makes Rum . The white Mulberries are small , so it must be slow Work to gather them by Hand , if therefore you spread Matts or Sheets underneath , and shake them down , it will be an expeditious Way . From these collateral Considerations we have sufficient Argument to induce us to plant these Trees , preferably to others , even if the grand Object were out of Question ; but , as the Article of Silk is capable of being enlarged , and extended , as far as we please ; ( for , as they raise no Silk in England , but manufacture a great deal , and there are so many employ 'd in that Work , that the Number would seem incredible to those who do not know , or consider , that in GreatBritain there are supposed to be Eight Millions of People ; ) there is no Danger of overstocking the Market . If it should be allowed that raising Silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a good Sort of Gain , it will pay for what we want as well as Silver and Gold , and , it being capable of such great Enlargement , renders it highly inviting . - Sir William Temple observ 'd , that Money in Holland was but three per Cent . Interest ; he enquired of the great Merchants , why they did not hire that Money , and turn it into  | Trade ? their Reply was , because their Trade , in all its several Branches , would neat , or yield clear Profit , but three per Cent . and there was the Risk besides ; if so , saith he , how comes it to pass you are so very rich ? They reply 'd , that it was from the Largeness and Extent of their Trade . We also have this farther Encouragement , that it has been found by Experience , that the American Silk takes a good Dye , it both takes and keeps the Dye well , which can not be said of the Silk of every Country . Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great Engine in Derbyshire , ( a wonderful Structure , consisting of Twenty-nine Thousand Five Hundred and Eightysix Wheels , all set a going , and continued in Motion , by one single Water-Wheel ) for working Silk with Expedition and Success , declared in Parliament , that the Turkey Silk could not be wrought in his Engine , but that the Silk from America answered very well , 3 and that , if enough of it could be had , they should not be obliged to lay out so much of the Nation 's Money for raw Silk from Italy . These two Facts are very much in our Favour , which should excite us to a speedy Propagation of Trees ; for there is scarce any Part of Husbandry , which yields more clear Profit , from small Cost and Labour , than planting useful Trees : To instance in the Apple Tree , a Tree well known ; Fifty young Trees we will call Twenty footnote 2 One who throws or twists silk . 3 Attempts were made at an early date to produce silk in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia engaged in the industry to a considerable degree . In 1759 , for example , Georgia produced ten thousand pounds of cocoons . Silk culture was also introduced in the North in New England , Long Island , Pennsylvania , and New Jersey . With the exception of eastern Connecticut , however , not much silk was produced in the northern colonies . The scarcity and high price of labor severely handicapped the establishment of silk culture as a branch of northern agriculture . See Peter Kalm , Travels into North America , I , 123 ; Tench Coxe , View of the United States of America , p. 93 ; P. W. Bidwell and J. I. Falconer , History of Agriculture in the Northern United States , 162o-186o , p. 1o1.  | Shillings , and one Day to plant them , is Two Shillings , for Interest of the Money Ten Years , Twelve Shillings , and Six Shillings for pruning the Trees ; at the End of Ten Years , adjoining Land - of equal Goodness with that planted with Trees , and of equal Quantity , that planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has no Orchard upon it ; in this Case , the advance Price , deducting the Expence , or prime Cost , is a clear Gain . Nay , I have known Land , only from the Advantage of being planted with Apple Trees , sell for three Times the original Value of the Land . And we know , by Experience , that a Mulberry Tree improv 'd for Silk , will yield more Profit than an Apple Tree of the same Bigness . Yet , after all , Men will neglect to plant , for Fear they shall not live to enjoy it ; but the good Husband-man waits for the precious Fruits of the Earth ; such Neglect indicates a Meanness of Spirit ; we are not made for ourselves only , but for Society and Posterity : I have met with it somewhere , that the Dutch require , as previous to a young Man 's Marriage , that he produce a Certificate of his having planted a certain Number of useful Trees , to be as a Pledge or Security to the Community , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Common-Wealth by him ; if a Father should give his Daughter half an Acre of Land , covered with Mulberry Trees , it may possibly be equivalent to her being supply 'd with Wool and Flax , both for herself and Posterity , so long as the Trees should last : How long these Trees will last , I do not know ; I have one at a distant Farm , now alive , which I have known more than fifty Years , and it looked like an old Tree when I first knew it , it has been lopped , and has grown out a-new ; it is probable , that by this Means we might make them last long . 7 . There is one Thing farther that may be an Inducement to plant these Trees ; as such Groves are proper Places for Re-  | tirement , Study , and Meditation ; this will have Weight with those who love Contemplation , those who are wise and good ; he that is not Company for himself , when alone , will be none of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who have no Fund for their own Entertainment , will afford but poor Entertainment for others . The Loneliness of a Grove , the solemn Shade , the soft Murmur of the Air , in the Tree Tops , all conspire to sooth our Passions , calm the Perturbations of the Mind , recover our fleeting , wandering Thoughts , and fixing them on proper Objects ; here is true Pleasure and Serenity , beyond all that Pomp and Noise can give ; surely it is not without Foundation , that in all Ages and Countries , Trees and shady Groves have been the favourite Subjects of Poets , both heathen and divine : It is needless , and it would be endless to recite what has been written on this darling Subject ; but I can not forbear turning to one Passage , Isai. lv. 12 . The Beauty of which has not been taken Notice of . The Mountains and Hills shall break forth before you into singing , and all the Trees of the Field shall clap their Hand . This is expressed with a Grandeur and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly exalted &; poetical . The Garden of Eden was furnished , not with Palaces , but with a great Variety of Trees ; here was original Beauty , and primitive Grandeur . Abraham entertained his heavenly Guests under a Tree : Abraham shewed the Esteem and Regard he had for Trees , when he made a Purchase of Ephron ; he took Care to secure the Trees , for he bought the Field and the Cave that was therein , and all the Trees that were in the Field , that were in all the Borders round about , were made sure . Gen. xxiii , 13 , to v. 19 . We have here an Abstract of the oldest Deed of Sale in the World . Whoever reads the whole with Attention , if he is a Lover of Antiquity , will be fill 'd with Admiration , to find an  | Instrument of such an ancient Date so complete , both with Regard to the essential , and circumstantial Parts . And we may further observe , that Abraham planted a Grove in Beer-sheba , and called there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gen. xxi. 33 . In after Times these Places were multiplied , and some of them became Places of great Fame and Resort ; as that at Sichem , Josh. xxiv. 26 . Mispah , Bethel ; Gilgal : The Jewish writers , Philo , Joseph us , and Epiphanius , tell us , that they were Places walled in , and planted with Trees in Places of Retirement , and on Mountains , hence they were called High Places ; these were in Use , and continued from Age to Age , for we read of them in the New-Testament , they were called at that Time Proseucha , or Places of Prayer . It is said of our Saviour , that he went out into a Mountain to pray , and continued all Night in Prayer to God , in the Proseucha , as Dr. Doddridge renders it , in the Oratory , or Place of Prayer . Luke vi . 12 . So Acts xvi . 13 . Agreeable to what has been said , we read ; And on the Sabbath he went out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wont to be made , a Proseucha , or Place of Prayer . But , you will say , did not these Groves and high Places become an Execration , and the very Scenes of Idolatry , so loudly complained of ? True , the best Thing may be prostituted to the worst Purposes ; the House of Prayer was converted to a Den of Thieves ; nevertheless , our Saviour , we see , made Use of one of these Groves . Christ saith to Nathanael , I saw thee under the Fig-Tree . I do not remember that the Mulberry Tree is mentioned more than twice in the Bible , and then on the Account of two remarkable Incidents , 2 Sam . N ) .. 24 . Let it be when thou hearest the Sound of a going in the Tops of the Mulberry Trees , that then thou shalt bestir thyself . Psal. lxxxiv. 6 . Who passing thro ' the Valley of Baca , make it a Well , that is the  | Valley of Mulberry Trees . I can not but hope , that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become an extensive , and flourishing Branch of Trade , * altho ' my great Age excludes all Expectation of living to see it ; I shall think myself happy , if in this or any other Way , I may contribute in the least Degree , to promote the Good of my Country . God is graciously pleased to meet us with Instruction , in the several Parts of Husbandry , even in this of Trees . Every good Tree bringeth forth good Fruit , but a currupt Tree bringeth forth evil Fruit . Every Tree that bringeth not forth good Fruit , is hewn down , and cast into the Fire ; wherefore by their Fruits ye shall know them . The Ax is laid to the Roots of the Trees . Let us so conduct us , that we may be called Trees of Righteousness , and Plants of Renown , and have our Fruit unto Holiness , and the End everlasting Life . NOTA BENE As the Silk Balls contain , some of them male , and others female Worms ; and as some Persons have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been to their great Disappointment ; for , if they have but few Eggs , they can have but few Worms , which must frustrate their whole Design , for one Year at least . Since the above was written I have been well informed , that to avoid this fatal Inconvenience , you must save an equal Number of those which are oval , or oblong , with those which are quite round , for one Sort contains the Male , and the other the Female ; the Female only produce the Eggs , and the Male are necessary to impregnate the Female , in order to continue the Breed . footnote * By a late Account from " Georgia , " it appears , that the Silk Manufactory is in a flourishing Way . In the Year 1757 the Weight of Silk Balls , received at the Filature , was only 1052 , last Year produced 7040 , and this Year already above 10,000 , and it is very remarkable that the raw Silk , exported from " Georgia , " sells at " London " from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from any other Part of the World .  | The Book was written in Winter , and now , June 12 , I am able to assure the Reader , that many of the Mulberry Slips , or Twigs , are now growing , which I set this Spring , both of the white and black Sort . If the Slips are bruised at that End which is set in the Ground , it may promote their taking Root .  | The Reverend Author of the foregoing Essays has evidently in them , made the Good of his Country the Object of his Attention . He has pursued this Object in the Method that the Instruction of Mankind ought to be pursued in . As Agriculture is the Subject of his Essays , he relates Facts and Experiments , which are the Foundation of almost every Kind of human Knowledge , and of that in particular ; and he has conveyed his Meaning in such Language as is adapted to the lowest understanding . As some Instructions of this Kind were much wanted in this Province , a Number of Gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spread those Instructions around them ; they are therefore now again recommended to publick Attention . The Writer of this Appendix , having had Mr. Eliot 's leave to correct or alter them , he would just observe , that he thinks they need no material Corrections . As I happened to be pursuing his Plan , in some of his Experiments , before I had any Acquaintance with him or his Essays , I acknowledge I was much pleased to find my Sentiments so agreeable to his , and to turn out in Fact , as in Theory it appeared to me they would do . But as Agriculture is a Science of so extensive a Nature in its Principles , and so useful to Mankind in its Consequences , I take it for granted it will not be displeasing to the Publick , if a small Addition is made to the foregoing Essays , either on Subjects which Mr. Eliot has but just touched , or on those which he has not entered upon . And here I take Leave to mention an Error , which , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in undertaking to open too large Tracts of Land at once for Improvement ; by which Means the Expence of inclosing , of perhaps fifty Acres , amounts to a large Sum of Money and Quantity of Labour , which , a small Part of , expended on five Acres well cultivated , would yield a much larger Profit ; for it is not the Quantity , but Quality of Land which must fill the Farmers Barn . Another Error , I mention , is , that in Pasture Ground we leave open too large a Piece to feed upon , in Proportion to the Number of Creatures to feed ; as it is frequently the Case , for one Cow to range on five or six Acres of good Land at once , whereas by Division Fences into two Acres Lots , the same Tract would maintain three Cows ; and if the Owner has but one Cow , he is at needless Expence of Fence ; or , if he inclines , he may improve four Acres in another Manner , for two Acres of good Land with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England they do not allow an Acre of Feeding Ground to one Cow ; but then their Method is , to have a Lot of Clover , which they mow an Armfull of twice a Day , and give it to the Cows in Racks placed in the feeding Ground , and by this Method , a good Cow will make two hundred Weight of Butter , and one hundred Weight of Skim Milk Cheese , in the Course of the Year . There is another Advantage I have experienced in Division Fences , that in a wet Year I have saved several Lots for Mowing , which my Creatures did not want the Feed of ; and , had my Pastures lain in common , they would have been trampled down and useless . As Agriculture is founded on Principles of natural Philosophy , it is therefore absolutely necessary for a Farmer to be acquainted with the Nature of Soils , and sow on such as are adapted to different Seeds ; for to_the endeavour to propagate Wheat on a wet Bog Meadow and fresh Meadow Grass on a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would have only a good Crop of Labour for his Pains . The  | miry Swamp that has lain unimproved ever since the Creation , will , when drained , produce good Grass , and make the most constant Pasture : The higher loamy Soil will give a Crop of Wheat , Rye , Oats , &c.; and so of others ; when we see the Sand and gravelly Hills we seem to be at a Loss what they were designed for ; but as Nature hath not made any Thing in vain , we should turn our Thoughts to the Melioration or mixing of Soils , and we shall then find that every Thing is good for some Thing . When I have travelled the Road , I have seen on one Hand large Sand Hills , where the small Spires of Grass struggled to rise an Inch in Height , and on the other Side a gloomy Bog , that produced only Frogs and Reptiles , and have been at a Loss to know what Use they could be put to ; till a few Rods further hath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sand of the Hill on the cole heavy Soil of the Bog , hath begun a fine Piece of English Meadow ; This Hint which Nature hath kindly given , must be a full Proof that Sand is a proper Dressing for low wet Ground : But the Soil of the Bog will not always do for the Sand Hill , because when the Water which always kept it moist in its original State , is thoroughly drained off , it will then retain no more Moisture generally than the Sand itself . This Bog Soil , when it has lain in a Heap to ferment one Year , makes a good Manure for ploughed Lands that fall heavy , by keeping such Lands light , that the Roots of Vegetables will be able to range under Ground for their Food . Sand mixed with Clay , or Clay with Sand , will make a good Soil , for the chief Cause of Vegetation is Water ; and could we contrive any Method to keep a due Proportion of it in Soils , we should hit on a Part of Knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what would be the most effectual Method to secure a Crop : Now Sand lets the Water pass through it as a Sieve doth , and Clay retains it  | too long , but when mixed in due Proportion , they make a good Soil ; the Art is to proportion them and mix them thoroughly , and this must be learnt by Experience . It is well known and practiced in England , to burn Clay for Manure ; for the burning destroys the Cement in the Clay in some Degree , so that it will not hold too much Water , and when burnt , it serves to manure loamy Soils . On what I have now said , of the Cause of Vegetation , I would not be understood in too contracted a Manner : There have been great Disputes whether Fire , Air , Earth or Water , is separately the Principles of Vegetation , and the Disputes have been carried on by Men of great Ingenuity . For my own Part , there is no Doubt with me , but they unite in promoting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Water is the chief Cause , whether as Water simply considered , or as containing the finest Particles of Earth , and so serving as a Vehicle to convey those fine Particles into the Tubes of Plants . The purest Water contains such Particles , and I can not conceive how the Substance of a Tree can consist of Water divested of Earth , since the Tree may be reduced to Earth itself . But the Limits of this Appendix are too confined , to enter upon a thorough Examination of so curious a Subject . I shall now make a few Additions to what Mr. Eliot has mentioned . In the 5th Page of this Impression , he has begun upon clearing the low swampy Grounds . He justly observes , that the Charge of ditching will be paid in the Fence that comes out of the Ditches ; and let me add , that if no such Fence is wanting , the Mud that comes out of the Ditches , by being stacked one Year to ferment , and used as Manure for heavy Lands , will over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a beneficial Part of Husbandry as ditching Meadows , not to'make his Ditches either too narrow or  | too shoal , for if too narrow , they will often want cutting , by coarse Grass growing at their Sides and confining the Water too much , and so will be overflowed a great Part of the Year , and be kept almost in its first State . Some Years since I saw such a Swamp ditched three Feet wide at Bottom , and nigh five Feet at Top , and so deep that Allowance was made for the Soils settling ( which it did a Foot and an half , and would have settled much more had the Soil been deeper , for it was but about four Feet deep in most Places ) and it has produced a Variety of Vegetables . It is now chiefly good English Meadow , but it has produced forty Bushels of Oats upon an Acre , and very fine Winter Rye . This is subject to early Frosts in Summer , and late Frosts in Springs , how it is with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be best for English Grass , Oats or Rye . Indian Corn hath been planted in it at six Feet Distante of Rows , and there have been thirtythree Ears upon one Hill , but generally eighteen ; it was computed there would have been at least seventy Bushels on an Acre , but the Owner being obliged to plant later than common by Reason of the wetness of the Soil , and the Corn being touched with an early Frost it did not produce above twentyfive Bushels an Acre . One Pint of Rye sowed in it , produced one Bushel and twelve Quarts . A Gentleman in Weymouth had such a Swamp where he said he raised his Corn for Eight Pence per Bushel ; the Charge of ploughing and hoeing being trifling to that of Uplands . An Article of very great Importance is Hemp . It is a Commodity of great Value , and very profitable to the Farmer : A Tun of it is worth Sixty Pounds lawful Money , and an Acre of good Land , well tilled , will produce a Tun Weight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise proportionate to the Price , and such a Price will afford a distant Transportation to a Market . I have heard it objected , that it wears out  | Land soon ; but supposing it doth , if a Farmer can reap a Profit from the Improvement of an Acre of Land , which will give him three or four , or perhaps six Times the Value of his Land , I think he need not be concerned about the Wear of it : but if it should exhaust the Strength of his Land , there are Manures enough to repair Hemp Land as well as Corn Land . I can not but express my Surprize , that there is no Encouragement given for the raising it : by the best Account I can get , of the Consumption of Hemp in this Province of Massachusetts-Bay , it requires not more than One Thousand Acres to supply ourselves ; and what a trifling Quantity of Soil is that , to the Lands and Farmers of the Province ? and how many Thousands a Year would it save to the Province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Encouragement of Arts , Manufactures and Commerce , I am informed , have lately given large Praemiums for raising Hemp as well as other Articles in these Northern Colonies ; and not only these Colonies , but all Mankind are running deeply into Debt to them , for their benevolent Praemiums for the Encouragement of Ingenuity and Industry : and if I should presume to hint any Thing to the Legislature of this Province , to promote the Interest of it , I hope the Good of my Country , which I am not ashamed to own that I have a Regard for , will excuse me . As to Manure ; there are very great Varieties : but that which seems to be of the greatest Estimation by all who have wrote of Manures , is Marie . I acknowledge that it gives me great Satisfaction , to find it in different Parts of the Province . I have seen it proved in light Lands , and am apt to think , that not any of the Manures comes nigh it . It has the Reputation of lasting many Years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak Clay , and so is disregarded . There were several Pieces published in the Boston News-Papers last Year ,  | which described it 's Nature and Qualities ; and was I not limited to a short Appendix , I would with Pleasure enlarge upon it ; since I have great Reason to recommend it , from the Proof I have already had of it ; but as I imagine that the Reputation of the foregoing Essays will spread them into Places where those News-Papers may not have reached , or may be lost , I can not excuse myself from a short Description of this most useful Manure . It generally lies in low Land , and not deep under the Turf : To try where it is , bore into the Ground with an Auger that has a long Shank to it , and the different Soils will be brought up by it . When you suspect that you have found it , rub it between your Fingers under Water , and if it rubs off easily , feels like Grease and without Grit , you have then one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as big as a Walnut , in the Sun or Air , and when thoroughly dry , put it into a Vessel , of Water of the Warmth of Rain ; let the Water cover it about half an Inch , and if it bubbles like Loaf Sugar and dissolves , you then have the concluding Proof of its being Marle . It is of different Colours and Textures , the Colours are white , blue , reddish , and yellow ; Some are weak ; which are more proper for Lands that are closer than Sand or Loam ; the heaviest is best for the lightest Soil . It ought to lie in Heaps for a Year after it is dug , in order to ferment ; and then to be used . If put upon Grass Land , it ought to be spread thin and bushed , in the Fall of the Year . If upon Tillage Land , to be well ploughed in ; and it would be best to carry it on Indian Corn or Potatoe Land , to be well hoed in and mixed , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that on Grain Land , fifty or sixty Load will last fourteen Years ; they say that the general Rule ought to be , one hundred and twenty Loads on an Acre of Tillage Land , which will last thirty Years ; and if so , the Proportion of Charge between that and Dung is easily computed . It is also said , that it doth not  | show itself fully in the first Year , but is constantly increasing its Benefit . If any of these Hints may be of Service to this my native Province in particular , or to any of the Colonies in general , it will give me Pleasure . June , 1761 . Jn . Turner  | An Essay , on the Invention or Art of making Iron from Sea Sand , &c.; AS one great End of our Existence , consists in being useful to each other in social Life , in a careful Discharge of all relative Duties incumbent on us ; sensible of this , according to my small Capacity I have endeavoured to promote the Good , and general Interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with whom I have a strong Connection ; but by Reason of my Situation in the Country , Want of proper Instruments to lend Assistance in searching into the Secrets of Nature , and State of Bodies , have been able to make but a slow Progress in that which I have so much at Heart . With this View , I now give an imperfect History of a singular Sort of Sand , called scouring Sand ; denominated so , on the Account of its peculiar Fitness to scour , burnish , and set a Gloss upon Pewter , and other Metals : It is also more extensively known by the Name of Writer 's Sand , much used by Merchants and Printers . Of this Sand there are three Sorts , black , brown , and red ; the black is much the best for every Use as yet known : These sands it certain seasons cover the Face or surface of the Sea Beach , to the Extent of ten , twenty , and even to sixty Rods in Length , in some Places : Had they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their uncommon Colour , and ponderous Nature ; they might have remained unnoticed to the End of Time . These Sands appear and disappear at different Seasons of the Year , they appear in the Summer and Autumn , and in a great Measure disappear in the Winter . They lie in the greatest Degree of Depth close in with the  | Upland , then fall away gradually towards the Sea , ? know not whether there be any beyond Low-Water Mark . I once thought these Sands were brought up by the Waves of the Sea , and then by the Agitation of the Sea in Storms , and by the great Hurry of Waters , were carried back again to the Sea ; but am now fully convinced that this Conjecture was unphilosophical , and not founded on true Principles : As the Solution of that Phoenomenon did not then appear any Way interesting , my Thoughts were unattentive , nor was I concerned whether my Conjecture was right or wrong ; but I am now certain , that the black Particles of these Sands are Iron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived from the upland Earth adjacent , as also from other distant Lands ; I conclude so , for the following Reasons ; First , Because these Sands are not found on Flats or a low Beach , but are found at the Foot of proper upland Earth . 2d , They are found only where the Sea hath made Encroachments upon the Land . 3d , Because that when Fragments of the Earth are broken off , or you dig into the Ground , you will find the same Sort of Iron Particles as you find on the Beach below ; these Particles of Iron in the Ground , are of the same Colour and Dimensions with those on the Beach ; at least they appear so to the naked Eye , with which I am obliged to rest satisfied , having no Microscope to ascertain and determine the Thing : I suppose that these Particles are Iron in their primitive and original State ; and that these Particles were created at the Beginning with other Parts of the Earth , viz. Gravel , Clay , Chalk , and Grit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metals in Mines , and those great Beds of Ore called Mountain or Rock Iron , as also Bog Mine Ore , both are no other than a Collection of these Iron Particles , conveyed by Water to such Places as are fit , in their Formation , as in a Bed to receive them ;  | where we find them in such great Masses , and in such a State of Cohesion , that we are obliged to break it up with Crow Bars , Sledges , Wedges , and Gun Powder . There is good Reason to conclude , that this great Collection of Sand Ore would long before now have formed into Masses as we find it in Bog Mines , and in Mines of Rock Iron , were it not that these Iron Particles are so frequently put in Motion by the Agitation of the Sea , in its Flux and Refiux , that there is not Time to form a Cohesion ; this Motion of the Iron Particles is what keeps them so pure and free from all favulous and other heterogeneous Mixtures ; which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this Sand Ore will afford such a large Quantity of Iron , beyond that of Bog Ore , or Mountain Ore : The Iron Mines of New-Milford and Salisbury , which are accounted very good ( if I remember right ) afford but one Ton of Iron from three or four Tons of the Ore ; ordinarily they reckon four Tons , one with another , to a Ton of Iron . I formerly had an Interest in the Ore Bed in Salisbury , which I have sold ; the other in New-Milford I still retain , but having committed it to the Care of one of my Sons settled in those Parts ; I have in some Measure forgot the Proportions of Ore to Iron , but think I am not mistaken ; and can correct afterwards if I find any Mistake . When we dig thro ' these Ore Sands , underneath we find a yellow Substance , much resembling what those who dig up the Bog Ore call the Mother of Iron , which they suppose to be the Pubulum and Food of the growing Bed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be the Cement which holds the Particles of Iron together , but is prevented in doing its Office by the frequent Motion of the Particles of Iron , and so falls to the Bottom where we find it . These Iron Particles are scattered in many Parts of the Earth , and carried forward by'the Water from Rills to Brooks ,  | from Brooks to Rivers till they fall into the Sea , mingle with the Sand Ore , and add to the Quantity , or to some proper Bed . Travelling the Road with the Reverend Messrs . Ruggles and Todd , at the Bottom of an Hill which we had descended , while we were discoursing on this very Subject , we observed some Sand brought down by the Water , nigh a Brook , which it might probably reach the next Rain ; on the Top of that Sand there was a thin Stratum of a blue Colour , we had nothing convenient to take off this Stratum , but took up all together , brought it to my House , and dried it ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we extracted with the artificial Magnet 15 Grains of Iron Particles , which were in Figure and Colour the same with the Sand Ore . If it be objected , that as Iron is much heavier than Water , so it must be contrary to the Laws of Gravitation to suppose Iron to be transported in Water : If we consider how Iron may be plated so thin as to swim in Water , and that these Particles of Iron are much less than Plates made by Hand , it is not strange they should swim . As these Particles of Iron were on the Surface of the Sand , so they must have floated on the Top of the Water by which they were conveyed ; if these Particles of Iron were much larger , the Velocity and rapid Motion of the Water might thrust them forward , as we see Gravel and even great Stones tumbled forward by the Force of Water . Since this Observation was made , Persons that are curious and attentive , have seen frequently in the Roads and elsewhere , these Iron Particles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only in Vegetation , but also for Transportation of Bodies to the Place of their Destination ; so what a Political Writer said of the Dutch , that they were the grand Carriers of the World , footnote 1 A pennyweight is the twentieth part of the ounce in troy weight , used-in the United States and England for valuation of gold , silver , and jewels .  | may with greater Propriety be applied to Water . Water not only serves to bring together the Materials which form a Tree , or a Mine of Iron , but also unites them together ; it is the grand Cement or Bond of Union ; take away Water from Wood and it will become like Powder of Post , take away Water from common Stone and it become as Sand , extract it from Limestone ( which as Borehaave saith , yields the most Water ) it will become Lime in fine Powder ; so I suppose , if Water was taken from Bog or Rock Ore , it would become like this Iron Sand Ore . Many Years past a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Want of Iron Ore , heard of a great Quantity in an Island ; they sent and found a large Bed of it , but the Water which had fed and maintained it being drawn away , or dried away , the Mine was starved , become dry like an Honey Comb , when all the Cells are destitute of Honey , and therefore would yield no Iron . I was also informed of another Iron Mine at Windsor , which was so richly fed with Water , fully impregnated with Iron Particles , that the Ore being taken away , the vacant Bed in a Number of Years was replenished with a new Stock fit for Use . It is consistent with Reason to suppose , that as it is with Fire , Water , Air , and Earth , so it is with Iron , which is a component Part of the Earth ; that there was at first , just such a Proportion and Quantity created , which is never more nor less , and hath so continued from the Beginning , and will to the End of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World , is gathered and collected into one or many Places , and is increased according to the Proportion of Fuel , where it is put in Motion ; which is vulgarly called a Fire . It is as easy to strike Fire with Flint and Steel , or if you have Wood , to kindle a Fire in Greenland , as in Persia , or the hottest Part of the World . Water which is raised from the Seas , Lakes , Ponds and  | Rivers , and carried in Clouds over the Land , is let fall in Dews and Rains , and then returns by Rills , Brooks and Rivers , to the Places prepared to receive it ; and as Water continues its circular Motion and Round , so I conceive it is with Iron ; by the Water the Particles of Iron are carried to a proper Bed or Receptacle , thence it is taken and wrought for the Use of Man , and is worn out in his Service ; or contracts a Rust and is consumed when it is worn away , as by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelling , or from Iron Shod Wheels in carting , or by grinding with a grind Stone : The Iron by these Means , reduced again to fine Particles , and returns to the Earth again : When it is corrupted by Rust ; this is much as when a Tree rots , or a Man dies , they Each return to Mother Earth again ; these same Particles of Iron then worn away , are not annihilated or lost , but being joined with Sulphur , and those other Materials which constitute Iron Ore , it proceeds and takes the same Journey round till it comes to the Smith 's Forge again : Under all these Changes and Revolutions there is no Addition ; the same Quantity as there was at first , there remains the same still , and no more . A Piece of Iron Ore was sent to me as a Curiosity from Salisbury , taken from the Ore Bed in that Place ; it was in the Shape and Form of three icicles , two or three Inches long , and joined to a Body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Particles of Iron , had ran down upon three Spires of Grass as Conductory to the Mineral Water , the Water from Time to Time drying away , left the Iron Particles in the above said Form : ? Which is a farther Evidence , that Iron in its primitive and original State , is in very small Particles , and are collected and brought together by Water , and there formed into Masses of various Forms , as we find in what we call Iron Mines . Iron if considered either Mechanically or Medicinally , is the most useful Metal in the World : An Ax made of Ir6n  | and Steel is for all Mechanical Uses very much to be prefered to an Ax of Gold ; Steel is only Iron differently modified ; if Amputation is to be performed , the Surgeon and Patient would choose a Knife of Steel , rather than a Knife of Gold . In the Rebellion under Pizarro in Peru , they were obliged for want of Iron to Shoe their Horses with Silver , but it was but poor Stuff for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferable to other more costly Metals . There has been much said of Aurum Potabile , 2 and of Preparations of Silver , but they are but splendid Trifles compared with Preparations of Iron ; but let the Preparation or Composition be what it will , whether a Water , a Powder , or a Salt , still it is Iron ; these Preparations pass through the Body , and return again to their original State . How useful is this Metal for the Forging and making the Instruments of Agriculture , for procuring our necessary Food ; for making Instruments of War for our Defence and Safety ; for carrying on our Trade and Commerce , so advantageous to social life : and therefore procuring a sufficient Store of it must be of great Importance to Mankind. * What I have further to write on this Subject , not only for the Sake of Order and greater Precision , but even from Neces- footnote * It is well known that Mercury or Quicksilver is a mere Proteus , can by Art be so ordered , as to appear ir'a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Operation ; as that of Salves , Ointments , Pills , and Powders ; yet can be reduced back to its primitive State ? . Yet , of itself it inclines to return to its original State or Condition , for in the Grave Dust of those who in Life had been salivated , it has been found returned back to Quicksilver with all its true Qualities , tho ' it had been exhibited in a very different Form . ? So Iron after it has passed through several Stages , and subsisted under various Forms , and having assumed different Types , Colours and Figures , may return each Particle to its original and primitive State : As we may conclude both from Analogy and Experience that this is the Case ? From these Facts we may infer , that the Doctrine of the Resurrection is neither inconsistent with , or contrary to the true Principles of Philosophy , as founded on Observation and Experience . 2 Literally , portable gold : a medieval cordial containing minute grains of gold .  | sity too , will be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Borders of Terra incognita , ? can advance not one Step forward , but as Experience my only Pole Star shall direct , am obliged to write as poor Men live , from Hand to Mouth , and as Light springs up before me as I advance . To trace the Matter therefore from the Beginning ; Some Years past viewing this black Sand , the present Subject of writing , with particular Attention , was very much of the Mind that the black Particles were Iron ; if it had been tried with a Magnet and was not affected by it , it would not have alter 'd my Resolution to try it if an Opportunity should present , having been credibly informed that the Mountain Ore of New Milford , was not affected by the Magnet , even when it was pulverized . Having had no Opportunity of making a Trial , the Matter rested till the last Year , when my Son erected Iron Works in this Town , in order to refine Pig Iron ; upon that I resumed the Purpose of making a Trial , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true , I might have sent some of this Sand to an Iron Work at a Distance : If I had , how unavailing would it have been , where I had neither Interest or Authority to stem the Tide of Prejudices that there is against Projectors , and the seeming Impossibility of making Iron from Sea Sand ? The Owner of the Works , and the Workmen would have united in rejecting such a silly Proposal : A Projector is under discouraging Circumstances , he must make his Face harder than a Rock ; for if he succeeds in any important Undertaking , it is then depreciated as no great Atcheivement , and within the Reach of an ordinary Capacity ; if he fails , it spreads general Joy , and he becomes a Subject of Ridicule , as a Jeffery Grimcrack , or a Second Don Quixote ; and indeed if the Undertaking be either useless , or impossible , such as the Art of Flying , the grand Catholicon , or the Philosop'her 's Stone , the Projectors are truly ridiculous .  | Mentioning some things of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , L.L.D . Esq ; to whom I am under great Obligations on many Accounts ; he very judiciously observed , that such Treatment was neither just nor political ; that the Germans acted a wiser Part , for if a Project failed , unless it was ridiculous in itself , the Undertaker was named with Respect , saying though it failed , yet it was well imagined . If some Body had not happily projected for us the Art of making Iron and Steel till this Time , we might have been confined to the Use of Stone Hoes and Axes , as were the miserable original Indian Inhabitants of this Land , and are even to this very Day . My Son 's Iron Works being erected as I said before ; some Time last November I rode down to the Beach , where I found the black Sand had in a great Measure disappeared . I filled my Saddle-Bags with the black Sand , which I gathered from the Surface of the red Sand , but the Chaffery was not then finished , and the Refinery not being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made , it was therefore necessarily suspended till the first Week in January . The Sand being weighed , which was designed to be used in the Trial , we desired the Workman to use his best Skill to see if he could ' make Iron from it : Against which , the Workman objected three Things . 1st , That he was not a Bloomer by Trade , but a Refiner , therefore it was out of his Province ; but as there was such an Affinity between these two Occupations , we did not doubt his Skill and Ability to do it , if done it could be . 2d , That notwithstanding the Weight and Appearance of this Sand , he much doubted whether it contained Iron Ore or not . footnote 3 " Chafery , " a forge in which iron is reheated previous to being wrought into bars .  | 3d , He farther observed that if it were Iron Ore , it consisting of such very fine heavy Particles like Flesh without Bones , having nothing to sustain it , would run down among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low , and consequently never gather into a Mass and form a Loop . This , I must confess , was a formidable Objection , a Difficulty which I had foreseen , and which we know not how to obviate , otherwise then by adding to the Sand some Cinder or Slag , which had stowed from Pig Iron in the Working ; notwithstanding this Difficulty , my Son and I were determined at all Events , that a Trial should be made . Besides the Exertion of Authority , we thought it best to engage the Workman to exert himself , and use his best Skill by motives of Honour and Interest ; let him know the Importance of the Undertaking ; he being a sober Man , who would use strong Drink with Moderation and Temperence , I promised him that if he could produce a Bar of Iron from that Sand , I would send him a Bottle of Rum . The Workman used great Diligence , Labour , Patience , and as far as I was capable of judging Skill too : As there were a Number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Undertaking , who grew uneasy with long Attendance , we diverted ourselves as well as we could . I told them that it had been said of Spaniards , that when they were angry with a Man , the utmost that I11-Will could suggest was , that they wished that he might be always employed in Building , and wait for a Man that should never come : That our present Situation made me think of a certain whimsical Enthusiast , who told his Wife , that if she had primitive Faith as he had , Stones might be turned into Bread ; therefore ordered her to heat the Oven well , then to put in Stones , and close the Mouth in good Order ; after two Hours baking directed her to draw the Bread ; before she opened the Oven , said , I do not believe that it is Bread ; on Sight of the Stones said , I told you so , that it would not be Bread ; to which the  | Man replied , All this is because you did not Believe ; but said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Workman being under great Discouragement took the Hint , and turns to me , Sir here is no Bread . After some Time found a Substance adhering to the Crowbar , which he shook off , tried with the Hammer , and found it Malleable , says , this is certainly Iron ; after five Hours Labour , the long look't for came at Last , he drew out a large Loop ; it bore Shingling and Hammering well , and when completed , the Bar weighed Fifty-two Pounds and an Half , and proved excellent good Iron ; Part of it was tried by the most Skilful of our black-Smiths , who pronounced it to be equal to the best of refined or Swedes Iron . Some may say , that such trivial Stories , and a long Detail of minute Particulars concerning a little Bag of Sand and a Bar of Iron , is really below the Dignity of Writing . I do not know what such Persons intend , by Dignity of Writing , unless they can Mean , that when a Person is to write a Letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , think himself going about something quite different from the common Actions of Life : That he must divest him himself of that Sociability , that easy Freedom , that Familiarity which is so much the Support and Pleasure of Conversation ; must now put on a distant and forbidding Air , assume a solemn Mein , a formal Stiffness , as if clad in Buckrum ; and being thus equipt is in Appearance like a Hog in Armour , very different from the inimitable Sir William Temple , who relates the common Incidents of Life , in such an easy agreeable Manner , as to engage the Attention , captivate the Mind , and excite the Admiration of every Reader . The Matter related is not so inconsiderable as some may think , but a Matter of importance ; for as to me , it was to know whether these numerous Sand Banks , which as far as we know , may contain Ore for many Thousands of Tons of
