A JEW in LOVE-Ben Hecht-Covici , Friede ( $2.50 ) . In this book Ben Hecht has created a character who may well cause many a reader to fling the book from him in too precipitate disgust . Coming to know people is not always a pleasant experience and Author Hecht 's creature seems at first a repulsive caricature . But the caricature grows into a portrait , the creature into a personality who is as interesting as he is unpleasant . Many an author would give his eyeteeth to be able to approximate the Hechticvitality . Jo Boshere ( real name : Abe Nussbaum ) made a fortune on the stock exchange , then turned his attention to publishing . But his real hobby was women . He was married to a woman " whom he kept concealed on ocean liners , " with whom he enjoyed sporadic interludes but to whom he was in no sense devoted . She was a cipher who only occasionally complicated his amorous arithmetic . Jo 's steady mistress was Alice , who used to write poetry before he made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he was fond of doing , like dirt . Jo was an introspective egoist and not much fun for those around him . When he discovered Tillie , a retired dancer still aching from her last affair , he welcomed her as a wanted complication . Then , against his will ( he had no judgment ) he found himself taking her seriously . Incapable of fidelity at his best , he went through all the contortions of betrayal , attempting even the wife of a best friend . A simplicist would say that Jo was his-own-worst enemy . His sadistic self-torturings finally landed him in a pretty mess : still completely married , practically sure he was in love with Tillie , he made dishonorable proposals of marriage to two other women . As luck and the author would have it , Tillie 's old lover turned up at this point , and just as the humiliation of being actually in love was threatening to bring Jo to a normal level , he overheard a conversation which even a cleverer man would have understood .

Ben Hecht writes with violence but without bad temper . Consequently his forceful delineations of character carry weight even when they are brutally offensive . Jo Boshere will leave few readers without some fellow-feeling . Hecht 's dialog is nearer real life than most authors dare go . Ben Hecht was a small , dark , demoniac member of the Chicago literary circle that gave the U. S. such figures as Sherwood Anderson , Theodore Dreiser , Carl Sandburg . Big-eyed , thick-lipped , baldish , he looks Mediterranean rather than Jewish . With Charles MacArthur ( husband of Actress Helen Hayes ) he wrote the Broadway smash-hit The Front Page ; with the same collaborator has written a new play that will be produced this year . Other books : Gargoyles , Erik Darn , 1001 Afternoons in Chicago , The Florentine Dagger , Humpty Dumpty , Broken Necks , Fantazius Mallare ( limited and suppressed ) . <P> *New books are news .
