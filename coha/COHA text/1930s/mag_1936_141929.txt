Long before he moved from Germany to the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton , Albert Einstein wrote an equation based on Planck 's little constant h to explain how and why light falling on a metal kicks electrons out of the metal , setting up electric currents . This photoelectric effect is now familiar to laymen because it serves to open doors in restaurants and railway stations , operate drinking fountains . <P> Last week Washington 's alert Science Service , browsing among the patent files , discovered that in his long search for a Unified Field Theory the great mathematician had not forgotten the uses of photoelectric cells . Patent No. 2,058,562 , it appeared , had been issued to Dr. Albert Einstein and Gustav Bucky . Manhattan X-ray researcher , for an automatic device to prevent unskilled photographers from under-or over-exposing their plates. * A photoelectric cell attached to the camera measures the quantity of illumination available , adjusts a screen of varying transparency so that the proper amount of light is admitted to the lens when the shutter is operated . Cornered by newshawks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snapped Dr. Bucky in Manhattan : ' ' A man must have some private corner in his life . You will excuse me , please . " <P> * The photoelectric exposure meters used with minicameras are not automatic : they give a brightness reading from which the photographer must adjust his exposure time .
