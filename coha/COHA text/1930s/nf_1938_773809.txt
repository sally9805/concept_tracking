txt // the prophet who had taken hold of his garment and torn it into twelve pieces , giving ten pieces to Jeroboam as a sign that he should have rule over the ten tribes of Israel . It is therefore to be presumed that Ahijah was well acquainted with the family of Jeroboam and it was to him that the latter turned when he needed information as to whether his son would recover from his sickness or not . He had evidently quarrelled with the old prophet , since he found it necessary to compel his wife to disguise herself when she went to his house with the diviner 's fee in her hand . The writer of the story relates how Yahweh had forewarned the prophet of the woman 's impending visit of inquiry and as he has expressly stated 1 that Ahijah was unable to see because of his advanced age , there can be no question of an omen being drawn from a visible object . The text ( after making a necessary alteration in the vowels ) 2 reads : And it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a strange woman . And when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door he said . . . When thy feet come in at the ( door of the ) city the child shall die . ' The Septuagint 3 preserves the connexion of act and omen , though less clearly : And it was that as she came into the city ( polin ) ' and it shall be as thou comest in at the gate ( pulen ) . ' The Hebrew order door ' and city ' is inverted . Therefore it is unlikely that pulen is merely a mistake for polin , and if the Septuagint justifies the addition of the word door ' before city ' the parallel in the Hebrew text is exact.4 The uncertain fumbling movements of the king 's wife at the door as she tried to imitate the timid approach of a poor woman could not deceive a man whose sense of hearing and perception had become sharpened by the loss of his sight ; the sound of a woman accustomed to the finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasant suggested the disordered dress of a mourner . Thus it was that the omen of the unnatural movement of the feet supplied the physical phenomenon on which the oracle was based . // Familiarity dulls the sense of horror which this savage and inhuman contempt for a parent 's anxiety would ordinarily evoke , and it is well to remember that the Old Testament contains the record of the gradual education of a barbarous people in the knowledge of God . The lower the starting-point the greater the glory of the summit of their achievement . At this time the only way to cope with the wicked was to exterminate them and men believed that in doing so they did the will of Yahweh.l LECTURE IV DIVINATORY PROPHECY ( continued ) Amos viii . 1 , 2. - Thus the Lord God showed me : and behold , a basket of summer fruit . And he said , Amos , What seest thou ? And I said , A basket of summer fruit . Then said the Lord unto me , The end is come upon my people Israel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books of the Old Testament have left us so little material that we can not trace the fortunes of the communities of prophets . A good deal is known about individual prophets like Elijah and Elisha , but of the rank and file we know next to nothing . They seemed to have formed a sort of chorus ; having little or nothing of their own to contribute , and living on the mantic prestige of their forefathers , they were well called sons of the prophets . ' They were a well-known fraternity . Later they were to be found in both northern and southern kingdoms , in Samuel 's time ; and they persisted until the downfall of the Judaean monarchy . But it is possible only to guess at their relation to what the Old Testament writers regard as the true religion of Yahweh . Probably they maintained what we may regard as a sort of religious independence until the time of Ahab and Jezebel , when the persecution of the latter led to a general massacre 1 and the survivors had to hide themselves in caves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found who were bold enough to rebuke kings in the name of Yahweh , but rigorous pressure from the foreign queen who was hostile to the democratic spirit of the free-born Israelite resulted in a compromise be-tween the prophets of the Tyrian Baal and the prophets of Yahweh , so that we do not , as we should expect , find the prophets of Yahweh in opposition to Ahab.2 Only thus can 142 // we explain the sympathy of the four hundred prophets whom Ahab was able to summon to commend his expedition against the Syrians . ' They had ceased to be men who proclaimed a message which they believed to be divine in origin , and had become servile ministers of the court . It may well be that a royal subsidy had succeeded in corrupting them after an attempt to coerce them had failed ; or perhaps their patriotism overcame all other considerations and so they gave their support to a man whose bravery and statecraft were of the highest order , and whose sins could be attributed to a foreign wife . The absence of any chronological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine what relation Micaiah held to Elijah , whose death did not occur until after Ahab had fallen in the border engagement which gave rise to the prophecy with which we are dealing . Elijah must therefore have been a contemporary of Micaiah . But there is some ground for thinking that Micaiah 's spiritual home was Judea rather than Samaria , for there are two occasions on which Jehoshaphat , king of Judah , asked for a prophet of Yahweh ' to be summoned to give his forecast of the future ? here and before the joint expedition against Moab , z when Elisha was consulted . On each occasion the king of Judah was unwilling to embark on a campaign without consulting a man who was believed to be the mouthpiece of Yahweh . Jehoshaphat had no confidence in the ravings of Ahab 's prophets . From this time onwards there is a clear distinction between the prophets ' and particular individuals who claimed to stand in close relation to the God of Israel . Such persons were always a minority ? few believed them , but the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so abundantly vindicated , that particular individual prophets of Yahweh became the interpreters of the mind of God to future generations . This difference between the one and the many , which is sharply drawn when it first appears , ultimately became an open battle between truth and falsehood ? a claim to know the will of Yahweh and a claim to predict the future . The struggle here begun was not decided until more than // two centuries later when Jeremiah , in the mental anguish of a patriot inspired with a message of destruction , was compelled to face the question : How do you know that you are inspired and that others who call themselves prophets are liars ? It is more than likely that the four hundred prophets who predicted the success of an expedition which Ahab had obvi-ously determined to undertake were men who made an easy living by soothsaying at Ahab 's court ? men like the zarragin of the Arabian stories ? and that they represented a decadent form of Yahweh worship which made compromises with sur-rounding heathenism so serious that men like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual descendants of these men with hypocrisy and falsehood and with having sold themselves as tools of the aristocracy and the priesthood . Therefore it is but natural to suppose , when they first stand as allies of the court against a prophet of Yahweh , that the vice of covetousness , which poisoned their powers in later times , was already at work . Nevertheless it must be admitted that the mantic frenzy which overcame these men was singularly favourable to the impress of what we call mass suggestion , and given an unscrupulous soloist like Zedekiah ben Chenaanah , many of the chorus would take up his chant ' Go up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper ' in all good faith . This prophecy can be put with reasonable probability in the year 853 B.C. , and as the attendant circumstances are set out in some detail it is possible to relate it to the kind of divinatory prophecy which the Beduin were wont to practise . As the old writer describes the scene , the two kings are to be seen sitting on their thrones in a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before them four hundred prophets are raving in ecstasy . ' Zedekiah , their spokesman and leader , knowing that a rival prophet has been summoned , has procured 2 a pair of iron horns . Ignoring Jehoshaphat by the use of the second person singular , he addresses the king of Israel : ' Thus saith Yahweh , with these shalt thou gore the Syrians until they be consumed . ' The four hundred obediently repeat the refrain ( cf. verse 6 ) , ' Go up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper . ' Meanwhile Micaiah had arrived , and Ahab asks him whether the expedition should be undertaken or not . His reply is a contemptuous and sarcastic repetition of the words of the four hundred : ' Go up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper , ' so that Ahab is forced to demand the truth in the name of Yahweh . He answers : I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains As sheep that have no shepherd . And Yahweh said : These have no master , Let them all go home in peace . ' What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep scattered over the hills of Samaria in their search for grass . The presence of the two kings and their forces has lent security to the owners , who have left their flocks in the charge of a shepherd or two while the rest , either summoned to serve in the border raid that is destined to end so disastrously , or attracted by the crowd in the capital , are already in the city . Micaiah continues Therefore , ( as you have forced me to speak ) , Hear the word of Yahweh : " I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne And all the host of heaven attending him On his right hand and on his left . " // And Yahweh said : " Who will deceive Ahab , That he may go up and fall at Ramoth Gilead ? And one said on this manner And another on that manner And a spirit went forth and stood before Yahweh And said I will deceive him . And Yahweh said Wherewith ? And he said , I will go forth and be a lying spirit In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Thou shalt deceive , and shalt also prevail . Go forth and do so . " Now , therefore , behold Yahweh hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all thy prophets , seeing that Yahweh hath purposed evil against thee . ' Ahab was sitting upon a throne . ' Micaiah sees Ahab as a figure of the divine king surrounded by his army of angels , the host of heaven . What he knows must have happened in the immediate past he transfers to the heavenly court . One malign prophet ( Zedekiah ) has shown a greater ingenuity than his fellows , and has thought of putting a lie in the mouth of all Ahab 's prophets , and this because Yahweh intends to compass Ahab 's destruction . Micaiah knows that the prophets must be wrong , and they can only be wrong because of a lie which Yahweh has permitted . If this interpretation be correct , the text affords little or no support to the alleged doctrine that Yahweh incites men to their ruin because Yahweh reveals the truth through his prophets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take . Great care is needed in the translation of Hebrew causatives both in the Old Testament and in the New and a literal rendering is often misleading . No doubt Micaiah would have held that no mis-fortune could occur without Yahweh 's being its ultimate cause , but the real enemy of Ahab is Zedekiah ; and now that his character has been laid bare and his prophecy derided , Ahab must be responsible for the defeat and death of which he has been forewarned . Zedekiah has no doubt as to Micaiah 's // meaning , since he immediately smites him on the cheek . He is identified with the spirit ( his mantic powers are recog-nised ) which became a lying spirit in the mouth of all Ahab 's prophets , and that is why he asks , Which way went the spirit of Yahweh ( which was ) with me to speak with you ? ' The meaning is : You are the liar , not I ; and as you claim to know the counsels of Yahweh perhaps you will explain to us how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed from me to you , as undoubtedly it has . ' To this Micaiah replies : Behold , thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself . ' These ominous words do not deter Ahab , who gives orders that Micaiah is to be imprisoned until he returns from Ramoth Gilead in peace . The last word 2 in-peace supplies Micaiah with a final oracle : If thou return in peace Yahweh hath not spoken by me . ' Hebrew prophecy closely resembles and yet profoundly differs from Arabian divination . If it is true to say that the phenomena of the present provide the material for the prophecy of the future for the seers in both the sister nations it is also clear that the Hebrew prophet relied on the word of Yahweh . Like Balaam , Micaiah refused to commit himself . He had been carefully coached beforehand by the king 's messenger who told him what the other prophets were saying , begging him to give the king a favourable prediction . With a solemn oath by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his God should reveal to him . He came to the place of decision with an open mind , waiting on the word of Yahweh which would become clear to him when the phenomenon of the moment presented itself . It will have been observed that like the Beduin seer whose divinatory gift had been released , he could not refrain from prophesying and he continued unasked to foretell the defeat and dis-persion of the Israelite forces . Nothing in the narrative implies that Micaiah was an ecstatic . On the contrary he stands in opposition to the ecstatic dervish-like prophets led by Zedekiah , and he speaks with calm assurance of the coming disaster , knowing full well that he is braving the king 's anger . // Nevertheless it is clear that all prophets from Balaam onwards were marked by some abnormal psychological pecu-liarity . They were not as other men are . There was some-thing intensely exciting in the exercise of their psychical powers . Similarly the Beduin who began calmly , registering the significance of the water-pots without emotion , became possessed by such enthusiasm that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by visible phenomena . A growing excitement is often to be perceived in the emotions of the prophet as his abnormal insight presents the image of , things to come before his mental vision . He feels the Hand of Yahweh upon him guiding him in the choice of ominous objects and directing him to an understanding of their significance . Perhaps nothing indicates so clearly the telaesthetic powers of the prophets as the story of Elisha 's temporary failure to know what had happened elsewhere . ' Elisha , whose gift of clairvoyance appears to have been more strongly developed than any of the prophets , confessed z that he did not know what had happened to cause the distress of the Shunammite woman . Knowledge of what was happening , or had hap-pened , afar off was normally his : for once , this power had forsaken him and left him in the ordinary man 's ignorance of the unseen . It is certainly remarkable , ' says Skinner , that Micaiah claims to have a truer knowledge of God 's will than that imparted by the spirit ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a special purpose , a lying spirit . ' The falsification of prophecy appears to be traced , not to the imperfection of its human medium , but to the supernatural source from which it emanates . To our minds , such a theory of prophecy involves moral difficulties greater than those it solves ; but it is enough that it enabled a true prophet to hold fast his faith , in spite of the fact that men possessed by a spirit not their own were prophesying what he knew to be a lie . ' 3 There is nothing in the actions or words of Zedekiah and his followers to suggest that their method of drawing an omen for the future was by way of a notion which the actual // phenomena of the present suggested to them . On the contrary Zedekiah , as it were , manufactures his material . Horns are not there : he has to produce them . Unquestionably his symbolic act is a form of mimetic magic , similar in kind to that which had already been employed by Ahijah of Shiloh if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevalence of this method of prophecy among the canonical prophets of Yahweh will be discussed below . The Book of Amos , with its introduction : ' the words of Amos . . . which he saw ( hdzdh ) concerning Israel , ' encourages the hope that some autobiographical account of prediction will be forthcoming . This expectation is satisfied in chs. vii and viii . Two common everyday objects which the prophet sees are invested with enormous significance , and Yahweh Himself explains to the prophet what their significance is . Let us take the second example 2 first : Thus did the Lord Yahweh cause me to see : And behold , a basket of summer fruit ( gais ) . And he said , Amos , what seest thou ? And I said , A basket of summer fruit . Then said Yahweh unto me , The end ( qes ) has come upon my people Israel . I will not pardon them again any more . In this colloquy the working of the prophet 's mind is laid bare . He sees an ordinary fruit basket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer , and it assumes omin-ous significance . Its name gat 's suggested ges , 3 the end of Yahweh 's patience ; and Amos felt that Yahweh Himself had conveyed the message to him by making him see the basket . Actually the method of divining the future did not differ materially from the Beduin method . There was the common object and there was the connexion of ideas through a word of similar sound . But there the parallel ends . The Beduin saw : Amos was made to see . The old intuitive method of augury had become the means by which Yahweh // revealed His purpose to His prophets . The basket of fruit was a mashal or parabolic or symbolic representation of the pre-determined counsel of God . In itself it had no signi-ficance , but its presence at a time when Amos was conscious of the guidance of the Spirit , and when his preoccupation with the fate of the country and the deplorable state of public morality was ceaseless , became of profound significance . It linked a conviction born of prayer and revelation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought him outward confirmation of inner certainty , while to his audience it carried the terror of the omen of evil . The preaching of the word of Yahweh might only enrage : the presence of a sign could terrify . Amos ' prophecies as a whole were rooted in a belief in the immutable righteousness of God , which demanded that a nation such as Israel then was should be removed from the land which it had polluted with its sins : everything else was secondary and accidental . Turning to the first example , 2 we find the same form of dialogue between the prophet and Yahweh . Amos sees a man stationed by a wall with a plumbline in his hand . The R.V. , following the Hebrew text , translates : ' Thus he shewed me : and , behold , the Lord stood beside a wall , ' etc . But this can hardly be right . Of the four visions 3 which Amos records three begin , Thus the Lord God shewed me , ' and they continue with the naming of the object seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of the sentence and makes it the object seen . As the Septuagint leaves the words , ' Thus did the Lord Yahweh show me ; Behold one stationed , ' etc. , in their customary order , it is all but certain that it is a man stationed ' by a wall that Amos sees , i.e. the builder who has been called in to test the state and condi-tion of the wall . The occasion affords a concrete example of the metaphor which Isaiah uses : I will make judgement the measuring-line , and righteousness the plummet , and hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies . ' 4 As Micah rose in spirit from the throne of Ahab to the Throne of Yahweh , so Amos sees in the form of an earthly builder the Heavenly Architect // of Israel who has come to apply the standard by which a bad building is marked for destruction . ' By far the noblest example of the fusion of the earthly and the heavenly is Isaiah 's vision in the temple.2 The ordinary furniture of the temple on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the presence of Jehovah Himself . In the language of the late Dr. Driver : The scene is the heavenly palace of Jehovah 's sovereignty , modelled upon , though not a copy of , the earthly temple at Jeru-salem . The comparatively small chamber of the Temple on Zion is indefinitely expanded , the lofty throne takes the place of the mercy-seat , the skirts of the royal mantle , falling in ample folds , fill the space about and below the throne , and conceal from the prophet , as he seems to himself to be standing beneath , the Form seated upon it . The two colossal cherubim , whose extended wings overshadowed the ark in the Holy of holies , are absent , their place being taken by a choir of living creatures encircling the throne . . . Isaiah , standing , as it were , by the doorway , hears the seraphs ' hymn of adoration ; and as the sound of their united voices peals through the expanse the pillars of the door shake to their foundation , and smoke , indicating probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fills the space around . ' 3 Obviously Hebrew prophecy has greatly developed since the days of Micaiah , the son of Imlah . And yet the method is the same . The eye and the heart are still the channels of revelation , but augury has become a vision in which the prophet perceives the divine will at work , deciding the fate of nations and separating the wheat from the chaff . In this vision more than the immediate objects of sight and the heavenly things they suggest are present . The prophet 's thought , consecrated to the high ethical purposes of Jehovah , mingles with the mystical experience of the temple vision , and evokes an emotion in the reader in character not unlike that which the prophet himself describes . // The note of authority in this authentic record is unmistakable . Like the words ' suffered under Pontius Pilate ' which press upon every Christian the recognition that the Incarnate life of Jesus is a fact of history , the words in the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord ' press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A definite date in Hebrew prophecy is rare , and has all the force of a solemn asseveration . From Isaiah 's own words we can see how the all-righteous God communicated His purpose to the nation He had chosen . The vision of Yahweh in His glory filled the prophet with a sense of sin and unworthiness which only God could remove . Reconciled to God he gladly accepted a task which was to bear little fruit save among a remnant . Much that is implied in the attitude and preaching of earlier prophets is explicit here . Consciousness of knowledge of the counsel of God is paramount and overrides all else . Partial and imperfect revelations to Isaiah 's predecessors are enlarged until the way to communion between God and man stands open . The majesty and moral holiness of God have now been made known to men : only the unbelief and moral insensibility of the people stand in the way of that universal righteousness to which Isaiah looks forward . Of all the prophets of the Old Testament Isaiah most closely approaches the English ideal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebuked all those whom it was to his interest to placate ; he saw his advice flouted and his country brought to the verge of ruin , yet he did not yield to the temptation to reproach his opponents , but prophesied the inviolability of Zion when all men had lost heart . He never doubted the truth of his vision , nor ( like Moses and Jeremiah ) did he ever shrink from the task which God assigned to him . He stands out from all other prophets as the indomitable witness to the reality of divine revelation , never weakened by hesitation nor shaken by the failures of others . Yet with these martial qualities he was tender-hearted , looking for man 's response to God 's love which had been so manifestly shown to Israel . To him the word of God was so certain that the future in so far as it had been revealed to him was as plain as the present ; and he expected statesmen in the throes of a foreign invasion or on the threshold of a momentous // decision to exercise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophecy that Sennacherib should ' hear a rumour and return to his own land " 1 and perish by the sword there , and that no arrow should be shot against Jerusalem , 2 was literally fulfilled , and proved that he was inspired with a knowledge of the future which did violence to all probability . Isaiah 's faith was so rooted and grounded in knowledge of God that it could almost be denied the name of faith . To the absence of faith and a knowledge of God amongst the people of his generation he traced all the disasters that befell them . But though the people as a whole might perish in their unbelief , the faith of the individual who separated himself from a sinful generation would be his salvation . The deep intensity of Isaiah 's vision of God can best be measured by his struggle to raise his nation from idolatry and superstition to a knowledge of God ? a task which forced him to oppose the prevailing current of political affairs and to endure for a time the shame of the despised and rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a man who spake from God , being moved by the Holy Ghost . ' 3 Before we pass on to consider other types of prophecy a few more examples may be given in order to complete our survey of this field . The Book of Jeremiah , with its immensely full record of the prophet 's struggles with misgivings within and enemies without , in its opening chapter affords two perfect examples of the Beduin method of augury : ( a ) Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying , Jeremiah , what seest thou ? And I said , I see a rod of an almond tree ( shirked ) . Then said the Lord unto me , Thou hast well seen : for I watch ( shoke 'd ) over my word to perform it . ' 4 The sequence of the ordinary object seen by the eye , its name , and the thought the name by way of assonance suggests is complete . Similarly too : ( b ) And the word of the Lord came unto me a second time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see a seething cauldron ; and the face thereof is from the north . Then the Lord said unto me , Out of the north evil shall break forth // upon all the inhabitants of the land . ' 1 In this case , unlike the first where the R.V. margin explains the assonance , the English Bible gives the reader no help in locating the ominous element in the oracle . The seething cauldron is literally one that is fanned or blown upon , and ( after omitting a letter which was not in the old Hebrew text read by the LXX ) the oracle says that evil will be blown forth from the north , consuming all before it like a flame driven before the wind.2 Another example of an oracle drawn from a visible object is to be found in ch. xxiv . Two baskets of figs , one good and the other bad , are made to stand for an estimate of the com-parative moral worth and survival value of the Jews in Babylon and the Jews in Judaea respectively . Ezekiel , Jeremiah 's contemporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated sections of his people and , as Jeremiah prophesied , the exiled Jews in Babylon became the determining factor in the religious future of the nation . The problem of the distinction between true and false prophecy I leave for discussion in the last lecture ; but some-thing must be said here about the sign which Jeremiah gave to the priests and prophets of Jerusalem at the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim.3 Yahweh , it is said , commanded him to make bands and bars ' and to put them on his neck . Apparently it is this yoke which he still wore at the beginning of Zedekiah 's reign to symbolise the coming servitude of Judah to the king of Babylon . A striking reversal of ancient pre-cedent has occurred . Several generations earlier Micaiah had brushed aside the horns which a false prophet had used : now a false prophet , Hananiah , destroys the yoke which Jeremiah had procured . To Hananiah the yoke stood for a tyrannous power which was to be broken by the word of Yahweh of Hosts , the God of Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only time could show which man had a right vision of the truth . More than ordinary men the prophet was vulnerable to suggestion from without ; he could be swayed and influenced // by the passions and the expectations of the multitude to an unusual degree , unless his mantic power was dedicated to Yahweh 's purpose . In such an atmosphere the lying prophecies of Hananiah germinated ; and herein is the ex-planation of the saying of Ezekiel : If a prophet let himself be deceived and speak a word , I , Yahweh , have let him be deceived . ' The man who acts as though vox pofiuli were indeed vox Dei can not expect true guidance , and Yahweh allows him to be deceived . An interesting discussion of the different meanings which the same words convey to those in a state of ecstasy is to be found in the work of a great Muhammadan mystic , ' who points out that frequently some are right and some are wrong in their interpretation of the inner mystical meaning of words and songs . He finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mystic 's mind and the different stages of spiritual development . Ecstatic states are entangled with the sinful personality of the individual , and perfection is not reached until a man is conscious only of God . Jeremiah , though he applies other tests , bases his assertion that his words are divinely inspired on intimate personal knowledge of the God who had predestinated him to the office of prophet , and who had taught him in ways of which his opponents were ignorant . The visions of Ezekiel , Jeremiah 's contemporary , belong to the category which we are considering . Heir to the pro-phecies of the greatest figures in the religious history of his people , Ezekiel exhibited in his prophetic ministry the out-ward characteristics of his earliest predecessors . One feels that he was born out of due time : he should have lived a century or two earlier ; - but it was decreed that he should exercise his ministry at a time when the national fortunes were at their lowest ebb , and thus his scathing denunciations of a rebellious people prepared the way for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great canal near the ancient city of Nippur in the land of his exile Ezekiel watched a storm coming up from the north . A great bank of cloud shot through with lightning flashes and charged with a sombre radiance overtook him , and ' the Hand of Yahweh ' came upon him . He saw a // wonderful vision : four living creatures , half-animal , half-human , bore a lofty throne on wheels , moving hither and thither through the cloud ; above it , enshrined in the brightness of a rainbow and veiled in brilliance of light , was a form as it were the likeness of the glory of Yahweh . In an ecstasy the prophet fell to the ground , and heard a voice commanding him to go and speak to a people who would not hearken . A priest cut off from Yahweh 's altar , horrified by the sin and moral insensibility of his people , conscious that they were hardened by adversity and embittered by exile  --  such a man abnormally sensitive to the reality of the unseen world , and full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazing at visible phenomena saw that which temperament and tradi-tion enabled him to see . He came into a personal relation with Yahweh , a relation which on his side was inevitably coloured and affected by the trend of his mind , the pictorial background of his imagination , and his capacity to apprehend new truth.I Fire , cloud , and storm were traditional accompaniments of a theophany , and it was to some extent natural that they should suggest to him as he pondered over the calamity of his people the coming of the Lord in judgment ; nor can it be doubted 2 that the winged and animal-headed creatures with which the walls of the Babylonian temples were covered , the huge man-bulls and the winged genii , together with some of the objects in the temple at Jerusalem , ' formed the imagina-tive background of his visions . All these things fell naturally into place and took shape in the prophet 's vision . To explain the constituent parts of the vision as a picture of such objects seen amid the flashes of a mighty thunderstorm is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole it eludes analysis . For our purpose it is enough to note that with Ezekiel the ancient method of perceiving the unseen and divine through the medium of the seen and mundane still prevailed . Ezekiel responded to ecstatic suggestion with complete selfDIVINATORY // abandonment . He more closely resembles the dervish in his actions and moods than any other figure in the Old Testament . Besides the acted signs which will be discussed later , it is to be noticed that his prophecies were often accompanied by violent movements of arms and legs ; these members he felt to be subject to divine compulsion in the same way as his mind . Smite with thine hand and stamp with thy foot ' I was Yahweh 's command when he broke into impassioned speech at the thought of the coming destruction ; he felt called upon to cry and howl and smite upon his thigh when he prophesied of the terrible sword which was to cut through the great ones of Judah.2 This man was possessed by the spirit of prophecy , especially in its ecstatic and predictive aspects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was filled with a sense of God 's outraged majesty , with wrath and hate against idolatry . Possessed of psychic powers of clairvoyance and clair-audience to an extraordinary degree , he was able to see in visions events that were happening hundreds of miles away . He was an Asiatic of a type which few Europeans are able to understand or sympathise with . So alien was his world of thought and emotion , so different his conception of God and society , so lost to all dignity and self-restraint as we conceive them , that it is wiser to offer an objective account of him rather than to judge him from the standpoint of another race and age . We can at least recognise his zeal for righteous-ness , his passionate devotion to his God , and the beauty of his poetry when he is deeply moved by the thought of the fate of the young princes of Judah , or by the image of the stately galleon of Tyre . The trances into which he fell as the result of the approach of the divine presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom we have record , and his dreams or visions were of greater substance and often brought him knowledge of far-off events . One such is dated in the year 592 , when he felt himself transported by the hair of his head from Babylonia to Palestine and saw there seventy elders offering incense to their idols in the very temple itself , while without at the gate the women sat weeping for Tammuz. // The ancient method of prophecy from seen events to events as yet unseen and unknown again comes to light in the pathetic story of the death of the prophet 's wife , the desire of his eyes . On the very day that the king of Babylon invested Jerusalem the word came to him that his wife was to die and that he must abstain from all conventional signs of mourning . When the people came to inquire what significance his unusual behaviour could have for ' them , he announced that Yahweh 's word was that the desire of their eyes would be taken from them ; the temple was about to be destroyed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to destruction and those of their families who had been left behind would perish with it . As in the case of Jeremiah , the prophet 's justification could be achieved only when his prophecy of doom was confirmed . The speechlessness which had fallen on Ezekiel was removed when a fugitive came with the news of the fall of Jerusalem , and the prophet 's mission entered upon a new stage : the messenger of woe became a shepherd consecrated to the task of raising a new community . An interesting example of Ezekiel 's telepathic powers is contained in the story of the elders of Israel who came to consult him . ' It does not appear from the narrative that any particular oracle was sought ; apparently men were in the habit of sitting and waiting for the words that might fall from his lips.2 He felt with a certainty , divine in its assurance , that these men were still idolaters at heart : the stumbling block of their iniquity ' was still in their path . Probably at that moment some were thinking that they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had worshipped in Palestine . In response to the words their minds had framed , Ezekiel announced that Yahweh would answer them by Himself according to the multitude of their idols by destroying them in their apostasy . Visions had marked and moulded the lives of Amos , Isaiah , and Jeremiah ; but no prophet was so often subject to ecstasy as Ezekiel . He is the connecting link between the ancient prophet of Israel and the post-exilic apocalyptist . But what was to become a literary device was to him a reality . A paramount sense of the prevailing presence of God controlled , // and gave unity to , the varied emotions which his visions stirred within him . The overwhelming force of the revela-tion of God with which his prophecies open was never lost . Though he seemed to proclaim destruction upon destruction , it was not a message without hope , for more clearly than any other before or after him he insisted that every man was responsible for his fate . God desired not the death but the repentance of the sinner . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the last stage of decadence . In Jeremiah 's life and work it held but a subordinate place and was never more than a detail . In the Deutero-Isaiah , the great prophet of the Return , there is no trace of the method at all . The author remains anonymous . His experience of divine revela-tion was personal and intimate , and though the promised future to him is naturally and inevitably coloured by glorified visions of a new Jerusalem and a nation in every sense of the word restored , ' it is a future which is in the mind of God  --  - not a future which is in any way linked with an omen in the present . Henceforth the Old Testament knows the old traditional method of vaticination no more . ' Haggai , Zechariah , and Malachi , devote themselves to the practical , moral , and religious problems of their day . Already in Zechariah there is evidence of a widespread conviction that a gulf stretched between the Judaea of the Persian Empire and the former prophets ' 1 of the old independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form and method . More and more the messages of Jehovah , as Zechariah and his successors inter-preted them , tended towards the cryptic . The visions neces-sarily contained phenomena familiar to men , but they were not earthly . Horses and horns patrolled and tyrannised the earth , and the Satan was seen standing at the right hand of the high priest . All are familiar with the fact that the Law , canonised , fixed , and unalterable , the very word of God to Moses , forced Prophecy into a subordinate position . The Prophets were read not only as a Second but as a Secondary Lesson . And I2 16o PROPHECY AND DIVINATION there was no room for more prophets . The need for prophets still existed , as witness the pseudepigraphical and apocalyptic literature , but the old method of inquiring of the Lord ' ( ddrash ) is met with for the last time in Ezekiel in the passage referred to above . Henceforward the word ddrash gradually acquired the meaning it has in Ecclesiastes i. 12 , I set my mind to seek wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set his mind to study the Law of the Lord and to perform it , and to teach in Israel statute-law and ordinance . ' It was not God that was inquired of , but the Law that was believed to be His final word . If prophecy was dying in the Exile , it is now ( c. 400 B.c. ) dead ; for in the words of this verse Ezra writes over it Ric jacet . In future any claimant to the office of prophet must necessarily be an impostor , and , as such , is to be put to death when he prophesieth . ' To the writer of the latter half of the Book of Zechariah it is inconceivable that a prophet should be anything but an impostor . The last flicker of a belief in a contemporary prophet having the mind of God appears in the Apocrypha : 2 And they took counsel concerning the altar of burnt offerings , which had been profaned , what they should do with it : and there came into their mind a good counsel , that they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them , because the Gentiles had defiled it : and they pulled down the altar , and laid up the stones in a convenient place , until there should come a prophet to give an answer concerning them . ' But there is no question of prophesying in the sense of giving a prediction . The point involved is mere ritual . What is to be done with consecrated stones which have been defiled ? How are the mighty fallen ! It is better to end , as the Old Testament does , with Ezra 's Hic jacet . To what is the decline and fall of prophecy to be attributed ? Burkitt , in his brilliant sketch of the rise and fall of Hebrew prophecy , 3 points to the existence of a written Code and its interpretation as the rival of prophecy , and in writing of Zechariah he says : The Prophets , in fact , had almost done t h e i r work : the danger now was that the claim to inspiration vuuild sink into a trade . ' But this danger was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the monarchy ; the professional prophet who lived on the rewards of divination had been the enemy of Yahweh 's messengers from the days of Ahab to the last days of Jerusalem . Doubtless the final blow to prophecy was given by Ezra the Scribe ; but he was only applying the logic of events . One would have expected that the prestige of Isaiah , Jeremiah , Ezekiel , and the Second Isaiah would have established prophecy on an unshakable foundation , and have kept the way open for other prophets to rise and speak as the Spirit gave them utterance . ' But , with the exception of some of the last chapters of Zechariah and the missionary tract which was ascribed to Jonah the son of Amittai , no voice was raised to rebuke the evil of the age or to make known the will of Yahweh , although Daniel , and the Apocalyptic writers whose works were excluded from the Jewish canon , are an indication that the Law by itself could not meet men 's spiritual needs . If we put the question in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hindered the rise of a prophet ? , it may be possible to answer the larger question , for it forces us to consider the outward forms which the evolution of prophecy in the individual assumed . So far as the evidence goes we have seen that all the prophets , from the greatest even unto the least , employed the sacramental method of interpreting phenomena , especially in the early stages of their ministry . So deeply rooted was this method in the religious psychology of the race that it is questionable whether we have the right to deny that prophets whose life and circumstances are unknown to us ( e.g. the Second Isaiah ) were ever subject to inspiration in this way . Something , then , must have happened to bring this visionary form of prophecy into disrepute ; and as even the great prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah gained their first experience of revelation through ordinary objects of vision , a reaction against any oracular visionary form of prophecy would , to judge from precedent , have strangled prophecy at birth . Is it not probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the cradle to the grave , whose religion was made up of superstitious magical practices , and whose system of omens was so comprehensive that prac162 PROPHECY AND DIVINATION tically nothing in life was devoid of dreadful significance , should have caused the Jews to revolt from every appearance of divination ? We know , indeed , that the ordinary Jew was superstitious in the sense that he stood in fear of demons ; but the Old Testament delivered the faithful from such fears : Yahweh was the Lord of the Universe , and as such was able to destroy the power of the magicians and to bring their schemes to nought . The many attacks against Babylonian gods which the Second Isaiah is forced to deliver show how great was the danger that the pomp and majesty with which the worship of the great Babylonian pantheon was surrounded might lead the Jews to think that their God was inferior to the great gods of Mesopotamia . Bold indeed was the challenge to the heathen to foretell the future . They whose special province it was to predict were charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then announcing . Enchantment , sorcery , astro-logy , all alike were impotent to save Babylon from its approach-ing fate . Those who gave advice on the strength of omens were specially singled out for ridicule and punishment . Was it not to be expected that those who so vehemently attacked divination in all its forms should abstain from any outward manifestation which in any way resembled it ? Furthermore , the Second Isaiah 's conception of the Servant of Yahweh , however it is to be interpreted ( and the difficulty of precise interpretation is notorious ) , is that of national , personal , or ideal election . Before he was born , the Servant was chosen by Yahweh to accomplish His work . The great-ness of this figure , whether it is ideal or actual , must inevitably have tended to throw into the shade the prophecies of those who might arise in the future . Indeed , the only great prophet who arose in Israel subsequently identified Himself with this Suffering Servant of Yahweh . But the greatest blow to prophecy may well have been the compulsory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prediction were common to Judaism and heathenism . It is plain , after time has brought its vindica-tion , that the resemblance is only superficial , and that the difference is profound ; but nothing is so fatal to the fine // flower of prophecy as the cold wind of unbelief . Where it was said that Jesus could do no mighty work there because of their unbelief , ' it might equally be said of a prophet that he could say no great thing because none would believe that he was a prophet . This was not true of Isaiah and Jeremiah , because in their day the validity of their method of receiving and delivering oracles was not questioned ; but it was true of a generation which knew Babylonian divination on the one hand and accepted the Law of Moses on the other . The occasion of the promulgation of Zechariah xiii . is not known ( though conjecture is rife ) , but there is a clear connexion between idolatry and prophecy . After it has been said that the very names of the idols are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if a man prophesies , his parents are to put him to death because he has spoken a lie i Y the name of Yahweh . Unless we are to suppose that once again the religion of Yahweh had been contaminated with heathen rites , l it is prophecy itself that is subject to the death penalty . This , too , seems the most probable meaning , as the hairy mantle ' which must cease to be worn was the mark of Israel 's prophets when the Desert rather than the Sown was the source of true religion . Despite the part that prophets had played in the teaching of the people , and despite the fact that it was they , and they alone , who had turned the religion of Israel into an ethical system which resisted the power of Hellenism and became , in its Christian form , the basis of modern society , nevertheless , after the Exile the prophet for some centuries was regarded as a blasphemer worthy only of death . Herein lies the reason for the great output of pseudonymous literature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a revelation from God ; and consequently names like Jonah , Zechariah , Daniel , Baruch , and others , were attached to prophecies and writings of which those long-deceased persons could have known nothing . Once the custom had become established ? it probably began by way of additions to the authentic writings of the prophets , and then , when that method succeeded , was extended so that men like Jonah and Daniel , who were known to have been prophets in ancient times , // were credited with definite written prophecies ? it grew with such amazing speed that what was at first a pious attempt to obtain a hearing for a neglected aspect of truth or duty , became a recognised literary convention . The wound from which sacramental prophecy was to die was received in Babylon , where its origin in the pre-Israelite religion of the Arabian peninsula became apparent ; and it was left to the Law , as promulgated by Ezra , to give the coup de grace . Driven underground , there sprang up from its roots that unhealthy growth of apocalyptic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a violent catastrophic inter-vention of the God of Israel . Such was one of the results of the suppression of prophecy when , as before in the days of Samuel , there was no open vision . So far we have dealt mainly with oracles which were drawn from visible phenomena and owed their relevance to a notion which could be extracted from the object seen , either directly or by way of an assonance or verbal connexion . There remain two other types of divination : ( a ) cledonomancy , the acceptance of the fatal word or of the spoken omen ; and ( b ) the acted sign . ( a ) Jonathan 's assault on the Philistine garrison at Michmash was determined by a cledon . ' He arranged with his armour-bearer that the words which the Philistine sentries should use should determine whether the assault was to be carried out or abandoned : if they dared them to climb the slope it was a sign from Yahweh that He had delivered the garrison into the hands of the Hebrews ; but if they called to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them it was a sign that the attack was not to be delivered . This incident is evidence that the old Hebrews believed that from Yahweh 's sovereignty over chance utterances His will could be inferred : the speaker became the unconscious agent of the god . In the spin of a coin this kind of omen , shorn of . all religious significance , survives to this day . Psychologically it met the need that men felt when confronted with an emergency that called for a decision on which depended success or failure , and when the pros and cons were fairly evenly balanced . It lifted responsibility from their shoulders , and , when fortified // by religious conviction , supplied that confidence which persons who have to choose between two evils or two doubtful courses are painfully conscious of lacking . A man who felt that his God was concerned with all that concerned him could risk his life in battle against great odds when he had received a sign ' such as Jonathan believed that Yahweh had sent . In a somewhat similar case of augury Abraham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman to become the wife of his master 's son : the woman who lets him drink from her pitcher and volunteers to water his camel is to be the wife that Yahweh has appointed . ) It might be argued that there was an element of shrewdness in this latter augury : the fact that the woman took no little trouble on behalf of a stranger indicated a kindly nature ; but the argument that the Philistines ' invitation to Jonathan indicated over-confidence is worth very little . Decisive action was made wholly dependent on an omen drawn from a chance utterance . Cledonomancy was , of course , well known to the Greeks and Romans , and to the neighbours of the Hebrews . The Old Testament gives us one example of its use by the Syrians in the story of the defeat and flight of Ben-Hadad and the ruse adopted by certain of his servants to save his life : So they girded sack-cloth on their loins , and put ropes on their heads , and came to the king of Israel , and said , Thy servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he said , Is he yet alive ? He is my brother . Now the men were divining , and they instantly seized it ( sc . the word brother ' ) from him ; and they said , Thy brother Ben-Hadad. ' 2 The Vulgate with its admirable rendering acceperunt viri pro omine of slightly involved Hebrew has caught the exact meaning which the makers of the Revised Version have put in the margin instead of in the text.3 // This kind of divination was ? and still is 1 ? extremely common among the Arabs . A good example from the year All . 65 ( A.D. 684 ) is recorded by the historian Tabari.2 A man somewhat in the position of Jonathan , in that he was faced by an enemy whose force was unknown , gives orders that the first person to come that way is to be brought to him in order that an omen may be obtained.3 He happened to be an Arab of the tribe of Taghlib , which means Victory , and the good omen was further strengthened by the presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies . Omens of this kind were called fa'l by the Arabs . The history of the term resembles in some ways the probable development of nihhesh in Hebrew.4 The last chapter of Ghazali , the Aquinas of Islam , is devoted to the Mercy of Allah , so that , as the author says , it may be an omen of the happy close of the believer 's life.5 With this may be compared the Jewish practice of reading the last verse but one of the Book of the Prophet Isaiah a second time after the final verse ( 24 ) , in order that the book shall not bring misfortune by its ominous ending The conclusion thus becomes all flesh shall come to worship before me , saith Yahweh ' instead of they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh . ' Similarly , the Revelation of St. John the Divine ends with a curse on anyone who shall add to or take away from what is written in the book ; but // two verses have been added so that the last word shall be gracious . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance utterances , as when a man , to beguile a long desert journey , murmurs a verse of poetry which could be given an ominous turn . On one occasion when a verse descriptive of the destruction of all but'one of a large gathering was recited , the hearer in agitation ' demanded to know if the verse had been quoted with any arriere fiensee by the speaker ; and when the man replied that he had recited the words in all innocence his hearer sorrowfully accepted them as a prophetic oracle.2 Of such a character , probably , is the oracle which Elisha pronounced against the officer of the king during the siege of Samaria.3 The prophet had announced to the king in the presence of this officer that on the morrow there would be a plentiful supply of food in the city which was then on the verge of starvation . In the circumstances there was every reason to doubt the prophecy , as the garrison were in sore straits and there was no hope of relief from without . When Elisha prophesied that grain would be offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied , If Yahweh were to make windows in heaven such a thing might happen ! ' Elisha 's answer is a remarkable foreshortening of the method of drawing an omen from the object on which the eye falls and the extraction therefrom of a notion applicable to the problem in question . ' It is not said that an ominous object ? in this case a window ? was present to his vision , but the notion of a window was given him ; and from that notion the oracle proceeded : Thou shalt see it with thine eyes but shalt not eat thereof . ' Here the connecting link is the window ? something through which a man looks at happenings in which he can take no part . The man himself suggested the fate that was to befall him . Another example of the fa'l is to be seen in the story of Isaiah 's reception of the rab-shakeh 's threats.4 Hezekiah had sent a last despairing appeal to Isaiah ending with the words : // It may be that Yahweh thy God will hear the words of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to reproach the living God , and will rebuke the words which Yahweh thy God hath heard . ' Isaiah 's reply is in the manner of traditional oracles : Thus saith Yahweh , Be not afraid of the words that thou has heard . . . Behold I will put a spirit in him , and he shall hear something , and shall return unto his own land ; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land . ' It is not possible in English to reproduce the full effect of the cognate accusative in Hebrew , which indicates the ominous emphasis which is to be laid upon the hearing ( shama ' ) of a rumour or report ( shemuah ) . Yahweh has indeed heard the man 's blasphemy , and now he in turn will hear something that will cause him to go to his death in his far-off land . One more example of a rather different character may be given . It is taken from the life of Jeremiah . ' Jeremiah had been beaten by Pashhur , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks . There , in pain and the open shame of his condition , he uttered the verses which go far to explain the prophets ' consciousness of their divine calling . Despair , humiliation , and terror , are uppermost at first , but the convic-tion that God has commissioned him to preach , and that therefore he will prevail over his enemies , ultimately comes to the top.2 The words of verse io , I have heard the defaming of many , terror on every side . Report ye , and let us report him , ( say ) all my familiar friends , ' 3 supply the key to the oracle which he utters against Pashhur on the following day when he is released from the stocks . Yahweh hath not called thee Pashhur , but Magor-missabib ( i.e. Terror-on-every-side ) . For thus saith Yahweh : Behold I will make thee a terror to thyself and to all thy friends . ' Here of course an omen is not drawn from a name , but a name is given to create an omen . If horns could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be coined to produce an omen . Such oracles as these are the counterpart of the acted sign . Hosea and Isaiah both used them . // A very early example of this kind of oracle occurs in the Second Book of Samuel . ' The speaker is that elusive prophet Nathan , about whom we know so little . Like Elijah , he steps without introduction into the narrative , and we know nothing of him but the facts incidental to the story itself . In the ancient document which forms the core of the Books of Samuel , after the lamentable story of David 's passion for Bathsheba , the death of Uriah , and the marriage with his widow , the well-known story of Nathan 's interview with David is described . Nathan is not called a prophet , though the later writer in ch. vii . rightly saw in him a forerunner of the prophets.2 The state of society which this narrative pre-supposes is that of the old desert democracy . The king is not a king , but a tribal chieftain , ruling by virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His people are not subjects but free-born Israelites , fellow-members of a confedera-tion of tribes . We know from the story of Naboth and his vineyard that this conception of society held until the foreign queen Jezebel succeeded in making Ahab behave as a despot.3 Nathan 's rebuke to David is a fa'l . And in the manner of its application it is ciosely linked with that principle which has always been dear to the heart of the Semite ? the law of the lex talionis , consecrated by the codes of Moses and Muhammad . David had smitten with the sword , stolen a wife , and put to death an innocent man . Therefore the sword would never depart from his house , his wives would be taken from him , and his child would die . ' ( b ) The last type of prophecy which falls to be considered 17o PROPHECY AND DIVINATION is often not divinatory at all . It is declarative . I mean that type of prophecy in which the prophet says that Yahweh has commanded him to perform some symbolic action , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it , he uses the acted sign as an example and a proof that a certain action will take place , or a certain happening will befall the people against whom the sign is directed . The symbolic act was conceived as initiating the event of which it was the symbol . Thus when the Assyrian commander besieged and sacked Ashdod in the year 711 Isaiah was commanded to go about the streets of Jerusalem in the garb of a captive stripped of the greater part of his clothes and without his sandals . ' This was to be a sign of the fate which was to befall Egypt and Ethiopia.2 Obviously this is prophecy , not divination . The sign , indeed , comes before the prophecy , but it is a part of it ; it is not the material from which the future is divined . It leads up to the future event , and has a definite effective power in procuring its fulfilment . This at least is how the Hebrews and their neighbours conceived the nature of a sign . Thus the acted sign has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a survival of the mimetic magic of man 's prehistoric past and on the other hand it is a development of the mysterious spoken word of a god which wrought its own fulfilment . In the first Lecture 3 it was shown that this principle of the Word of God was firmly established in the old Sumerian religion . Educated Sumerians thought of the Word of God as the Deity in action ; the wisdom of God ; His creative , regulating providence . The Semites did not consciously rise to this level of thought until they came under the sway of the philo-sophical schools of the Greeks . With them the conception of the Word of God was naive , but much more real . The Word of God was not an all-pervading wisdom , but the fiat of a heavenly king , who took cognisance of all that went on in the world beneath His feet . He revealed and entrusted that word to His chosen servants and , once liberated , the word ( or act ) must necessarily accomplish all that its divine speaker willed it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Semites that the // one thing a community needed above everything else was a man who could speak with this supernatural authority . Nowhere is the difference between Hebrew prophecy and heathen divination more marked than in the character and standing of its prophets . Among the Arabs a divining poet was more to be desired than a warrior , because he had the power of humiliating and disarming his enemies by curses and spells woven in the jingle of his rhymes . He was a tribal asset of inestimable value . He had his own private jinn or shaitan ( i.e. daimonion ) , who could inspire him to pronounce the shame and doom of his opponents . A great many of the oracles of the Old Testament directed against foreign nations undoubtedly are of this genre , though whether they are the work of the prophet in whose collected writings they figure is often very doubtful . They are the product of patriotism , rather than of religion ; though even in these to us least attractive or helpful prophecies of doom and vengeance there is generally a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country which he threatens in the name of Israel 's God . But the prophets who succeeded in convincing their hearers that they were the mouthpiece of God were not patriots in the ordinary sense of the word . On the contrary , they were opposed to the whole tenour of public policy . They opposed alliances with foreign powers ; they counselled neutrality when there seemed to be a good chance of winning long immunity from foreign oppression and crushing taxation thereby ; Isaiah even counselled resistance when prudence called for an immediate submission on the best terms obtainable . Almost always they were prophets of woe , announcing disaster and defeat in the name of a God whose every command had been set at naught by a disobedient generation . The good time to come , with few exceptions , lay in a distant future . Nothing like the prophetic literature of the Hebrews is to be found anywhere in the world 's literature , least of all , perhaps , in the writings of their Semitic kinsmen . In view of their unpatriotic attitude it would seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writings are extant was put to death . They were mocked and imprisoned , treated as criminals and fed as such ; but only one of the // prophets known to us by name was certainly put to death , ' though tradition often reports that others came to a violent end . There can be little doubt that they owed their lives to the popular belief that they were under the protection of their God . Their persons were sacred , and the many examples of veridical prophecy created an uneasy suspicion in the minds of their opponents that they might after all be speaking the truth.2 Probably this fear would have borne more fruit were it not that they were generally opposed by the court prophets and diviners , and when prophet contradicted prophet the rulers naturally followed the advice which tallied with their own inclinations and desires . Ahab 's campaign against Ramoth Gilead , which has already been discussed , 3 is a case in point ; while Jeremiah 's lifelong struggle against the false prophets illustrates the great difficulty that a prophet had of getting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophet could still command such reverence that his life was safe , but his influence was on the wane . This is another way of saying that it was not universally held that he was the mouthpiece of God in later times ; in the early days of the monarchy the belief in the effective power of speech was much greater . However , inasmuch as the sacraments of the Christian Church owe not a little to this conception of an effective power operating through words and actions , there can be little doubt that the ancient belief in the power of the spoken word and of the symbolic act maintained its hold because they were found to meet man 's need of God and to strengthen his sense of com-munion with Him . The extraordinarily intimate relation between word and act is illustrated by the old idiom of the Arabs by which it is actually possible to say he said ' when actions , not words , are // intended . Thus , Ibnu-l-Athir writes : The Arabs use the word speech ( qaul ) of all actions where no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus you can say " He spoke with his hand , " i.e. he took ; " He spoke with his foot , " i.e. he walked ; " Her eyes said to him , To hearken is to obey , " i.e. she signalled with her eyes ; further , the tradition " he spoke with the water on his hand " means he poured it on his hand . . . All these are metaphorical uses of the verb to speak . ' 1 The Hebrews , too , were accustomed to equate word and deed , for the same noun ( dabhar ) often does duty for both , and the cognate verb , to speak , ' carries with it the idea of acting or behaving . It is not easy to transfer one 's thinking into a region of thought in which such a way of speaking is natural ; but if we can do so it will help us to understand the way in which the ancient Semites looked upon the world . Speech and action were indissoluble and sometimes synonymous . They expressed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agents of their actions and words ; they were the interpreters and instruments of their god . What they did and said was the expression of the will of their god . Therefore their actions and words not only foretold what was to come : they actually operated in such a way as to bring nearer and make effective the fate foretold . It was this latter feature which made the acted sign more ominous and awe-inspiring in the eyes of the multitude . The world-wide existence of a primitive belief in the power of what is known as mimetic magic would suffice to explain the influence that prophets and diviners wielded in ancient Israel ; but above and beyond that we have the evidence of the most ancient Hebrew traditions . Moses , their great leader , had brought Yahweh 's plagues upon the Egyptians by proclamation and by energetic action : Moses stretched forth his rod towards heaven , and Yahweh sent thunder and hail , and fire ran down unto the earth . ' 2 Again , a similar action brought darkness from the heavens.3 In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egyptian magicians Moses took handfuls of soot and threw it up unto the air , thus symbolising the outbreak of boils which should come upon the Egyptians and their beasts.l Whether the plagues which undoubtedly came upon the Egyptians with unexampled severity at this time were actually preceded by words and actions precisely in the way in which Moses is said to have acted and spoken is not of fundamental importance . The systematised frame-work of the three writers whose work has come down to us in this portion of the Pentateuch may preserve the national memory of what happened with general rather than detailed accuracy.2 What is of fundamental importance is the belief in the power of the prophet 's signs ? a power not his own , but a power given to him by Yahweh ? which could release the forces of nature . The passage of Scripture which justifies the assertion that actions performed by a prophet , or through a prophet 's instiga-tion , are not merely symbolic , but are also effective in bringing about the fulfilment of a divine purpose , is 2 Kings xiii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph definitely and conclusively over their hereditary enemies , the Syrians , is attributed to the feebleness of the acted sign . The moment was ominous to a degree . Elisha , who was to Israel as chariots and horsemen , was on his death-bed , and therefore in immediate contact with the unseen world.3 He had told the king of Israel to smite the ground with his arrows . He did so but three times , and the prophetic historian records that the man of God was wroth with him and said , Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times ; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it : whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice . ' No doubt such a half-hearted response indicated that the king was not a man of force and decision , but that is not the point of the story . The act was ominous and determined the subsequent course of events . The power put symbolically into the king 's hands by Yahweh was lightly used , and its effect in action would be correspondingly lessened . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps even more clearly the action of Moses at the battle // of Rephidim illustrates the belief in the potency of symbolic action . While the tribesmen were fighting the Amalekites , Moses held up his hand with the rod . While he could maintain that position Israel prevailed : when his arm tired Amalek prevailed . To ensure the victory for Israel his two com-panions supported his arms till sundown . In the story as it stands the whole weight of the battle is thrown upon Moses ' all-powerful intercession with its quasi-magical accompaniment . Nothing is said of the valour or fighting power of the com-batants.1 A similar act of symbolic character is recorded of Joshua , Moses ' successor , in the taking of Ai.2 In the biography of Samuel3 an omen is drawn from an accidental happening . As Samuel turned to leave Saul the latter clutched at his robe which tore in his hand , and Samuel declared that this was a symbol of the fact that Yahweh had torn the kingdom from the house of Saul and given it to another . A very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tore his own clothes into twelve fragments and gave ten to Jeroboam as a sign that the nation would be divided into two unequal sections.4 This sign , unlike its predecessor , was deliberate and marked the prophet 's know-ledge of the Divine intention . Such acts were rare in the ministry of Isaiah , though it is to be remembered that his inaugural vision was informed by symbolic acts which marked his consecration to the prophetic office , and gave him the power and assurance of a life dedicated to the service of Yahweh who had inspired him with an overwhelming sense of His majesty and holiness and of His purpose to be worked out in the nation which He had chosen . It is at first sight not a little surprising that a prophet whose writings are marked by an intimate consciousness of God and whose teaching culminated in the prophecy of a time when men should know intuitively what the will of the Lord is , should have made use , not once or twice but many times , of symbolic acts to bring home to his people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . However , there is no 13 // finer and clearer example of religion escaping from the cramp-ing chrysalis of magic ' than in the life of Jeremiah whose actions at times differed little outwardly from the magic of the heathen , but whose soul was in constant communion with the God of Israel . It is unnecessary to go through in detail the story of the bands and bars ' which he sent to the chieftains of the surrounding peoples , the bar that he put round his own neck , the breaking of the potter 's vessel , and so on.r All these belong to the circle of ideas which has been discussed , and only one presents any new feature . During the siege of Jerusalem Jeremiah 's uncle came to him to ask him to buy the family property in Anathoth . Of this offer Jeremiah writes : Then I knew that this was the word of Yahweh. ' 2 So he bought the land and preserved the deeds as a sign that in days to come property would once more be bought and sold by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to come under the yoke of foreigners for many years . This act of faith was inspired by Yahweh Himself . It was a sign that the Jews would return to their own land , and that the mind of God was to do them good . Nothing was without significance in a world that was ordered by Israel 's God . Somewhat similarly Hosea interpreted his unhappy experi-ence as the husband of an adulterous and ungrateful woman . ' He read back into the past the deep and symbolic meaning of his unhappy marriage : it represented Israel 's rejection of a God who had given them their land and every opportunity for happiness . It is in this sense that the author of the first Gospel interprets the Old Testament . Its casual happenings were prophetic : the ministry of Jesus confirmed and estab-lished their meaning . All that had happened had its place in history , but its real significance was established in the life of Israel 's Messiah.4 Instances like this show how deeply reflexion and meditation on experience must have influenced the prophets ' utterances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship with the God of Israel they were able to see in everything a sign of the working out of that Divine will which had been revealed to them . Actions which at the time they were performed seemed to have no significance , were afterwards felt to be , as it were , God 's object lessons teaching the prophet from his own experience what the mind of God was . Hosea , who had committed himself to what seemed to have been an imprudent marriage , came to see that he had rehearsed in his own life the history of his people and his instinctive generosity and forbearance seemed to him to stand out as an acted parable of the loving forgiveness of Yahweh . Some pages previously I have discussed a few of the probable causes of the decline and death of prophecy in Israel . It is possible that Ezekiel himself may have had something to do with that decline . His book abounds in acted prophecies.l It is clear from the way in which the elders of the Jews of the Captivity received his prophecies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to the present and could therefore be ignored.2 It is probably due to his extraordinarily developed sense of the majesty and immanence of God , and the devotion to the law which the book that bears his name displays , that his prophecies have been preserved . The critical problems which this most difficult book creates have not been definitely settled , and it would be premature to express a definite opinion on them here without a discussion which would go outside the limits of these Lectures . It has even been disputed whether Ezekiel was in Babylon at all , and it is asserted that the prophecies are ex eventu , the work of a writer of the Greek Age.3 // Most scholars , too , doubt whether some of the symbolic actions attributed to Ezekiel were ever performed , on the ground that they are so extravagant that it can not be supposed that they really took place . Thus , writing of iv . 5 , Davidson 1 said : Even if 190 days be the true reading it is most improbable that the prophet should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it appears impossible when other actions had to be done simultaneously . The hypothesis of Klostermann hardly deserves mention . This writer supposes that the prophet lay on his side because he was a cataleptic and temporarily paralysed , that he prophesied against Jerusalem with outstretched arm because his arm could not be withdrawn , being convulsively rigid , and that he was " dumb " because struck with morbid alalia . It is surprising that some reputable scholars should seem half inclined to accept this explanation . They perhaps have the feeling that such an interpretation is more reverential to Scripture . But we need to remind ourselves , as Job reminded his friends , that superstition is not religion . . . The Book itself appears to teach us how to interpret the most of the symbolical actions . In xxiv. 3 the symbol of setting the cauldron on the fire is called uttering a parable ( cf. xx . 49 ) .2 The act of graving a hand at the parting of the ways ( xxi. 19 ) must certainly be interpreted in the same way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to some of them , probably the actions as a whole . They were imagined merely . They passed through the prophet 's mind . He lived in this ideal sphere ; he went through the actions in his phantasy , and they appeared to him to carry the same effects as if they had been performed . ' This writer shows his attitude towards the symbolic sign in a footnote in which he wrote : In regard to ch. iv . 1 ? 3 // Calvin remarks , Hoc fuit puerile spectaculum , nisi a Deo jussus fuisset Propheta sic agere . But that which would be puerile unless commanded by God remains puerile in itself , and the sound sense of men will conclude that God did not command it . I do not think that anyone sufficiently acquainted with Oriental life and literature would care to dismiss this story so definitely to-day . The feat was a mere nothing compared with the mortifications of Hindu and Muslim faqirs , and the Syrian stylites or pillar-men . ' The prophet was bound , but one arm was left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . It is not impossible that Ezekiel was temporarily paralysed , though such an assumption is not necessary to explain his abnormal acts . He attributed his physiological ( or psycho-logical ) inhibition to a command of Yahweh , just as he inter-preted his wife 's death to His will.2 It is not reverence for Scripture which dictates this interpretation , but general considerations . If other men , in this very region , have done similar things in the belief that they were acting ad majorem Dei gloriam ; and if it is admitted , as it is , that some of Ezekiel 's enacted symbols were really performed , it must be demonstrated that those to which exception is taken were impossible before they can be rejected out of hand.3 Lucian 4 tells us that at Hierapolis at the sanctuary of the goddess Atargatis there was once a pillar which a man climbed twice a year and stayed there for seven days in prayer to the gods . Ezekiel was strongly influenced by Babylonian sculpture and the symbolism of the Babylonian temples which appear often in his visions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stylites felt , that in outdoing the mortifications of the heathen he was testifying to the greatness of his God . Ezekiel 's visions , his symbolical figures , and his symbolic acts , stand or fall together . It is not just to apply the literary 18o PROPHECY AND DIVINATION and aesthetic standards of the Europe of to-day to the Orient of the sixth century before Christ , though judged even by a modern standard there are many passages of great beauty in Ezekiel.l Whether the causes be those which I have suggested , the fact remains that symbolic acts were hardly ever used again in Israel , so far as we know . An exception is the coronation of Zerubbabel , though here the text presents many difficulties.2 But prophecy in Israel did not end with the Old Testament , which , as it could not tolerate another prophet , closed with a promise that Elijah the prophet should reappear to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children before the great and terrible day of the Lord should come.3 In the New Testament Hebrew prophecy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The vision of Zacharias which St. Luke records 4 bears all the marks of an overwhelming religious experience . At the moment when Zacharias was to make the incense offering which was to carry the prayers of Israel into the Divine Presence , he became conscious that the great wish of his heart was to be gratified : he was to have a son . An external voice which his forefathers would unhesitatingly have ascribed to Yahweh , a later priestly reverence for a transcendent God required him to attribute to an angel . The child that was to be born was to be dedicate to God from birth as a new Elijah who should , like Israel 's ancient champion against idolatry , deliver the people from their enemies and from the hand of all that hated them . Over-come by the vividness of the vision Zacharias became dumb until the prophecy of the birth of the child was fulfilled . The events which followed were in themselves the ordinary happenings of life , common to human experience , yet , like // the events which were the occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed to be of divine significance . Thus , when Mary , within whom the Incarnation had already begun , went to visit Elizabeth , the babe leaped within the womb of Elizabeth who , filled with the Holy Ghost , ' cried , Blessed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb . And whence is this to me , that the mother of my Lord should come unto me ? For behold , when the voice of thy salutation came into mine ears , the babe leaped in my womb for joy . ' Elizabeth 's experience was in no way unusual , but coming as and when it did , in the presence of the Holy Mother to be , it evoked a prophecy which , in the manner and method of its proclamation , was in complete union with the oracles of the Old Testament . Again , the old man Simeon waiting in the temple for the consolation of Israel , feeling divinely assured that before he died he would look upon the Lord 's Christ , sees two poor parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; and , in the poetry of prophecy in his Nunc Dimittis , confesses Mine eyes have seen thy salvation . ' Simeon had come into the temple in the spirit ' 2 ; he was led to believe that some great revelation awaited him there , and the first thing of significance on which his eye alighted was a child called Salvation ' . The late Dr. Burney has shown by his examination of the language of poetry which our Lord used in His discourses that He stands at the end of the long line of Hebrew prophets . A great many similarities could be found between their method of drawing lessons of high ethical import from surrounding objects present at the time and His own method of teaching , e.g. the taking of a child into His arms and saying , Except ye become as little children , ' etc . But this is not prediction : indeed it is remarkable how few definite predictions are recorded of our Lord . Furthermore , where predictions are implied , as we have not the original words of our Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a certain element of conjecture must be present , as in the words The kingdom of God cometh not with observation , ' 3 which to the Semitic // scholar seems to have a meaning other than the obvious one . But at any rate one clear case of vaticination of the old order is to be found in our Lord 's words : And as some spake of the temple how it was adorned with goodly stones and offerings , he said , As for these things which ye behold , the days will come in which there shall not be left here one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down . ' 1 I venture to cite one other passage 2 which , though it has nothing to do with prediction , is germane to our discussion because in it our Lord is called a prophet . It is interesting to observe that it is precisely because He appeared to the woman of Samaria to have divined the hidden secrets of her past that she calls Him a prophet . In the case of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word husband ' and the train of thought the word would evoke in the woman 's mind , were the cause and occasion of a telepathic communication between her and the prophet . // There is , of course , no need to resort to a similar supposition here , though it would not be out of harmony with the perfect manhood of Christ . ' If such be the explanation of the way in which many of the Biblical oracles were given , how , it may be asked , is it possible to find room for the deep sense of Divine compulsion which inspired the prophets ? How can their solemn assertion Thus saith the Lord ' be justified ? The answer , I think , is that to the Hebrews God was the immediate cause of every act in the universe , and therefore sights and sounds which fell upon the senses of the prophet at the moment of prophesying were signs ' communicated by God at that particular moment to indicate His will . A similar explanation may be given to the oracles of the Beduin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a heathen god : in Islam they were believed to rest on a knowledge of Allah 's purposes . In Islam , as in Judaism , there is no intermediate agent between God and creation . This attitude towards the insignificant is especially character-istic of the man of the desert . Few things happen in his closely ordered life , but everything that does happen is ominous . His hard-headed , matter-of-fact nature is little inclined towards speculation , and his long leisure he employs in watching and observing . As his poetry shows , all phenomena exist for him in so far as they affect him or his people or , in certain stages of his thought , in so far as the things that are seen can be interpreted as a revelation of the Unseen . Those Hebrew prophets who lived in mind or body nearest to their desert kinsmen have preserved most faithfully this attitude of watch-ful- expectancy towards the small happenings of life.2 To the modern mind such methods of divination as those we have discussed may seem childish because it is obvious that the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which might , or might not , have happened when they did.3 Whereas our forefathers thought it natural that The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes , ' // the Semites could find sufficient warrant for their belief in divine predestination and human power to predict its course in the sight of sheep scattered on a hill-side or in the killing of a wasp . Often in our thought there is a vast gulf between man and God which is bridged by a chain of causes . The Hebrew , on the contrary , lived in the sphere of God 's immediate action : he felt himself to be literally , not metaphorically , under the hand of God . ' His life , and the life and movement of the universe , were from moment to moment under the immediate operation of the Divine will . In such a world nothing , however seemingly insignificant , was without importance : everything expressed Divine purpose which it was the function and privilege of God 's chosen prophets and ministers , who received His guidance , to interpret . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our Lord . Nothing is insignificant . Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing ? and not one of them shall fall on the ground without your Father : but the very hairs of your head are all numbered . ' 1 Moreover , of the spoken word ( to which reference has been made in the inference drawn from Luke xxi. 5 , 6 ) , He said : And I say unto you , that every idle word that men shall speak , they shall give account thereof in the day of judgement . ' 2 As the people of God are forbidden to call God 's creatures common or unclean , so they are forbidden to regard anything in God 's creation ? a creation that embraces all activity as well as all being ? as insignificant . To the Christian everything is to be viewed sub specie aeternitatis. 3 LECTURE V DREAMS AND VISIONS Numbers xii . 6. - ' If there be a prophet among you , I , the Lord , will make myself known unto him in a vision , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunate in having detailed discussions and analyses of the relation of man to the unseen world written by men of outstanding ability who represent the genius of the Jewish and the Arabic-speaking peoples . A collection of examples of prophecy , hydromancy , rhabdomancy , oneiromancy , and so on , among these peoples , instructive as it is in laying bare the principles on which men acted and the forces which impelled them so to act , must necessarily present an incom-plete picture unless place is found for a review of the study which their co-religionists have devoted to the subject . In a note I give a few references to books where more detailed information can be found ) . Here I confine myself for the most part to the studies devoted to the subject of revelation , prophecy , and divination by the Spanish Rabbi Moses ibn Maimun , whose eighth centenary was celebrated in 1935 , and the Tunisian , Ibn Khaldun , who died at Cairo in the year 1406 . Both these men represented a society and a world of thought which was no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek thought , especially of Aristotle , and their way of thinking was modern in the sense that they looked for the causes of things ; they sought to systematise beliefs ; and to give a rational interpretation of life : in short , in their time and generation they were philosophers , but the society in which they moved was Semitic , saturated with the // traditions of the past and continually open to the influence of Semites whose culture was primitive . The first-named is regarded by his co-religionists as the greatest Jew since Moses ; the second is only gradually winning in Muslim estimation the place which Western scholars , who recognise his great services to learning , long since awarded him . Maimonides , as he is called by European writers , is sur-prisingly modern in his outlook ; and quite apart from his great and long-recognised influence on Christian theology deserves to be regarded as the greatest Jewish interpreter of the Scriptures . Judaism owes to him as much , or more , than Western Christianity owes to St. Thomas Aquinas . His great Summa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was written with the express intention of reconciling the truths of revealed religion with the findings of philosophy . In the middle of his work he devotes some seventeen chapters to the study of prophecy , preparing the way by a discussion of the meaning of the words The Lord spake unto X. ' 2 Thus he says that when we read that God spoke to the prophets we are to understand only that the prophets attained a knowledge of the Divine will , and that what they said comes to us as from God , and is not only the product of their own minds . It is of no moment whether the Divine thought or will becomes known to man by a voice which he hears or by other means of inspiration ; for speech , thought , and will , predicated of God , are simply accommodations to the modes of human thought.3 Here we have an intelligent and reverent explanation of revelation ; it is the Divine will acting through human personality , informing but not suppressing it . Maimonides departs utterly from the spirit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asserts that prophecy is an emanation sent forth by God through the medium of the Active Intellect , first to man 's rational faculty and then to his imaginative faculty , ' 4 though // he has some valuable observations on the action of the latter during sleep . A person can not be a prophet unless his imagina-tive faculty is naturally highly developed . In such persons sensual impressions are retained in all their freshness , com-bined with one another , and built up into new images of thought . The imaginative faculty does its work when the senses are at rest , for it is then disposed to receive divine inspiration . Veridical dreams and prophecy differ in quantity , not in quality . The words of Scripture , If there be a prophet among you , I , the Lord , will make myself known to him in a vision , in a dream will I speak unto him , ' show that prophecy is a perfection acquired by dream or vision : in such a state a thing is seen as though it came from with-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prophet 's thought and meditation were not without influence on his imaginative faculty which in turn illuminated his mind in dream and vision . Maimonides ' dictum that imagination is influenced by the intellect only in so far as it is predisposed to such influence ' exactly applies to the things which the prophets saw , ' such as the almond tree which suggested a new thought to Jeremiah . Stripped of its mediaeval Aristotelianism his theory was that a prophet was a person whose mind and thought had been disciplined by prayer and meditation , and whom God had chosen . With sure instinct he points to sadness , anger , and lassitude as the enemies of illumination . Prophecy is dependent on man 's co-operation with God , and therefore depends on the bodily or mental state of the individual . Unless he is receptive he can not receive . He applies to his own time the words , Her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not ; yea , her prophets find no vision from Yahweh ' : 1 in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are points of contact between the teaching of Maimo-nides and St. Paul . Maimonides divides men who are occupied in divine things into three groups which can be subdivided into smaller groups . These are : ( a ) those who , like philo-sophers and thinkers , can respond to Divine influence only through their logical powers ; ( b ) those who , like the prophets , // can respond with both logical and imaginative faculties ; and ( c ) those who , like statesmen , lawgivers , diviners , charmers , men who have veridical dreams , or do wonderful things by strange means and secret arts , can respond only through the imaginative faculty.l St. Paul 's 2 summary of the categories of leaders in the Church presupposes an order based on somewhat similar considerations : ( a ) apostles , 3 ( b ) prophets , ( c ) teachers , then powers , gifts of healing , helps , governments , kinds of tongues ; but the greater gift is prophecy which all are urged to desire earnestly . By prophecy St. Paul seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spirit of God . To the modern mind it is astonishing that Maimonides should include such dissimilar types as lawgivers and diviners in the same category and that he should assert that the imaginative faculty of the former was in the ascendant to such an extent as to deny them a place with thinkers ; and also that any place should be found for those who practised the black arts . Apparently neither Jew nor Arab in the Middle Ages had any difficulty in believing that wizards and diviners were able to work wonders and they accepted them and their works as part of the natural order of things ? a fact which goes to show that even the strongest and most confirmed monotheists still retained a belief in magic . Exactly what St. Paul and Maimonides had in mind by the working of wonders is not quite certain ; but probably St. Paul meant the healing of the sick , while the feats with which Maimonides would be familiar were the actions still performed by dervishes // to-day , such as fire-walking , swallowing swords and nails , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workings of the Semitic and the Western mind than in their view of miracles and wonders . Paradoxically it may be said that miracles and marvels are very ordinary things to the Semite . It seldom occurs to him to doubt them . Muhammad , for example , never doubted the miracle of the Virgin Birth , or the miracles of Jesus ; and the miracles of the Muslim saints created a problem for Muhammad 's followers only because they appeared to rival the miracles of Muhammad himself , not because of any inherent improbability in their occurrence . Maimonides deals with exactly the same problem in his 35th chapter , and asserts that the general distinction between the miracles of Moses and those of other prophets was that his wonders were wrought in the sight of all Israel , while those of other prophets were done in the presence of a few people only . Even Joshua 's miracle , when the sun stood still , was no exception . l Maimonides distrusts those whose intuitive mystical vision is unchecked by intellectual discipline . He does not doubt the reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put upon it , and the consequent actions which their misguided inferences lead them to take . Maimonides would have said with St. Paul : Desire earnestly the greater gifts . ' Such men as these , who do not strive to advance to fuller knowledge , amazed by the visions that they perceive , think that they have acquired wisdom without training , and their teaching is a strange mixture of truth and fiction . ' The author has a profound observation to make on the effect of prophecy : people are influenced and continue to influence others until finally persons are reached , who , though comprehending for themselves , are unable to communicate the Divine will to others . Prophecy in its high reaches is a com-pelling force which urges men to go on delivering their message even though death be the inevitable result . The word of Yahweh is made a reproach unto me , and a derision all the day . And if I say , I will not make mention of it , nor speak // any more in his name , then there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in my bones , and I am weary with for-bearing and I can not contain . ' 1 According to Maimonides all prophecies and all instances of revelation came to the various prophets either in a dream or by a vision , or through an angel , whether these means are explicitly mentioned or not . Even where a man is intro-duced as the speaker , and only subsequently discovered to be an angel , it is to be inferred that the occurrence is visionary , not real . Thus , when Jacob wrestled with an angel , we are to understand that a visionary phenomenon is in question.2 This theory Maimonides pushes to extreme limits . Thus the story of the three men who appeared to Abram , which follows the statement that Yahweh appeared to him in the plain of Mamre , and all the conversations and actions which are recorded therein , he holds to have happened in a prophetic vision . He asks his readers to note very carefully this great principle of Biblical exegesis.3 He does not like the intrusion of the divine into human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whenever he can he interprets angels as human beings . 4 In discussing the type of divining prophecy which has been illustrated in the preceding lectures Maimonides holds that DREAMS AND VISIONS iqi the prophet saw things in a vision and perceived their meaning when he woke from sleep . We ourselves , he says , dream that we are awake and are telling a dream to another person who tells us what its meaning is . Such is the explanation of the visions of candlesticks , horses , and mountains , which an angel showed to Zechariah ; the scroll of Ezekiel ; the wall made by a plumb-line which Amos saw ; the beasts of Daniel vii . and viii . ; and the seething pot which Jeremiah saw . The effect of Maimonides ' theory is to throw all the weight upon dreams and visions and the exercise of an abnormally developed imagination , though he has guarded himself against the danger of unduly exaggerating such a theory by postulating equal intelligence and imagination in prophets . He notices the fact , to which attention was called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophets are shown do not so much illustrate the object of the vision , as indicate it by their name , the said name being a homonym . Thus the imaginative faculty forms the image of a thing , the name of which has two meanings , ' the significance lying in the other meaning which is not represented by the image at all . He quotes the examples shaged and shoged , gain and qes , which I have already discussed . Still more strange , ' he says , is the way in which a prophet 's attention is called to a certain object in the following example : he is shown a different object , the name of which has neither etymologically nor homonymously any relation to the first object , but the names of both contain the same letters though in a different order . ' The example is Zech. xi . 7 ff. , I took unto me two staves , the one I called Graciousness , the other I called Destroyers ( HOBHELIM ) .1 Maimonides follows his predecessors in their interpretation of the passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under good and then under bad kings ( staves ) ; and though this can not be right as an interpretation , as there is a recent historical allusion in the passage , there is considerable interest in his note that God 14 // destroyed the people because they despised ( BANAL ) Him.l As he says : The prophet found in the name HOBHELIM an indication that the people despised God , and that God despised them ; not , however , from the word HABHAL itself , but by a transposition of the letters B , H , L , whence the mean-ing of despising and rejecting was obtained . Therefore the prophet had to change the order of the letters . ' There can be no doubt that Maimonides is right in his explanation of the phenomenon of prophecy so far as this example is concerned : it is an allegorised vision . Neverthe-less the Arabian examples which I have collected in the preceding chapter conclusively show that no vision ' is necessarily required by a diviner when he pronounces what the esoteric significance of common objects is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the plain meaning of the text when acted symbols are used by the prophets . Maimonides saw this clearly , and therefore he was compelled to reject a literal interpretation of all such state-ments as My servant Isaiah went naked and barefoot . ' 2 But here he was wrong . The same actions which prophets and others performed in order to bring about by a sort of sacramental efficacy the result desired or decreed ? and it must be remembered that more often than not the result was not desired by the prophet but was a disaster decreed by Jehovah ? were , and are , still performed by magicians among the heathen . The mechanism , as it were , is the same ; but the prevailing motive is entirely different . A magician generally seeks by an acted sign to impose his will on events : a prophet seeks by means of a similar acted sign to bring about the predetermined purpose of God which has been revealed to him ; and at the same time he strives to convince his audience by a sign which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing the end its agent has in view . The study of comparative religion only from an anthropological point of view has caused some to overlook this point and to suppose that the Hebrew religion // can be explained ' by the religions and beliefs of other nations . It can be so illustrated , but it can not be so explained . In the first place , when one can point to some religious custom about which a particular belief or superstition was held and to something similar in a higher religion , it is a fallacy to suppose that the latter is nothing more than a survival of the older custom with its attendant superstition . In the second place , the whole history of the Hebrew , and we might add of the Christian , religion , is a process of divinely guided selection . Heathen myths , heathen ceremonial , heathen prophecy , and heathen philosophy , have all been drawn upon by the Hebrews ; and comparison with their sources shows how , despite the constant atavistic tendencies of a mixed population , the tenacity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment and transmuted the ideas and doctrines of more highly educated nations into unalloyed monotheism . Maimonides has endeavoured to identify three types of prophets on what we should call psychological grounds . He then goes on to point out the different types of prophecy . Modern study of the development of prophecy in Israel from the earliest times , which includes both the inflamed ecstatic of the Books of Samuel and the quiet mystic of the Psalms , has shown that the same noun is the agent of a verb which came to have two very different meanings . It is interesting to find that the Jewish scholar has to some extent anticipated this conclusion , although he tacitly excludes the ecstatics of Saul 's day from his discussion . This is the more remarkable as he must have been familiar with the dervishes who have so much in common with early Hebrew prophets . But Maimonides was bound by a theory of Holy Scripture which did not leave the door to a recognition of progressive revelation sufficiently open . He holds that there are some degrees of prophecy which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophet . Here , no doubt , he would have included the early ecstatics ; for he rather naively adds that when such persons are called prophets the term is used in a wider sense , and is applied to t Item because they are almost prophets ' ! It is not often that this great theologian is reduced to such straits ; but if we reflect that the traces of the transition from the meaning // raver ' to ' prophet ' through the stage ecstatic prophet ' have been laid bare only within the last few years we shall not find this slight lapse from his avowed purpose of reconciling reason and revelation hard to condone . ' Prophets , he observes , prophesy at different times in different types or states of prophecy , or , as we should say , by different means ; and he recognises higher and lower types . The two principal degrees of prophecy are : ( 1 ) The Divine assistance which enables men to accomplish great things , such as the deliverance of their country from the tyranny of foreigners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophets . ' He may have been led to do this because the Hebrew Bible includes the Books of Joshua to 2 Kings under the title Nebhi'im Ri'shonim , i.e. Prophetae Priores ; as well as for the reason that the campaigns of the Judges are usually prefaced by some such statement as the Spirit of the Lord came upon X. ' It would seem that the connexion with the office of prophet is to be found in the descent of the Spirit of Yahweh . Prophecy , then , is not a gift which manifests itself only in speech and moral leadership . It can inspire a man to wage campaigns and to fight battles on behalf of his country . It was the spirit of prophecy which moved Moses to slay the Egyptian , and it was the same spirit which moved him to act in defence of Jethro 's daughters . A prophet can not refrain from intervening when he sees injustice . By the same spirit David overcame lions and bears , and slew the champion of the Philistines . Acts of heroism and courage and foresight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as prophets : the term is only applicable to sublime actions which lead to some great end . It is difficult to follow the principle which Maimonides enunciates at this point . The motive which has always moved men to slay the enemies of their nation can not be very different at any time when men believe that they fight because they must ; but perhaps it is legitimate to infer that Maimonides means that history has shown how God saved the nation of Israel in the past by its prophets ; ' among whom were numbered soldiers as well as preachers . Here 1 v.s. // there is a lingering taint of the heresy that God 's favour is most clearly seen in worldly prosperity. ) ( 2 ) The second degree of prophecy is the power , not their own , which inspires men to address their fellows by word of mouth or through writings and poems while in a normal state of consciousness . Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit such was the origin of the Writings ' : indeed the term indicates that they were written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This category of prophecy is exceeding wide , embracing the seventy elders , 3 every high priest who inquired by Urim and Thummim , the oracles of Balaam , and the inspired utterances of David , Solomon , and Daniel . Maimonides is careful to point out that prophets of this class , though they were inspired , were not in the same cate-gory as Isaiah , Jeremiah , and others . On the whole it may be said that his reason for making a distinction is a sound one . Prophets of the type of David and Solomon received their inspiration and spoke through indirect intercourse with God , while the prophets of the highest rank were inspired by a vision from God.4 A sure instinct led him to see that such passages as The God of Israel spake : the Rock of Israel said unto me . . . ' 5 were not introductions to the actual words of revelation , but a resume of what had been said elsewhere on another occasion . There is , he insists , a vast // difference between a dream that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prophecy from God . Because the Jewish fathers understood this difference they placed the Book of Daniel among the Writings , ' and would not allow it a place among the prophets. ( 3 ) The highest degree of prophecy is that in which a man sees an angel speaking to him in a vision . Maimonides regards it as improbable ? he does not say impossible ? that a prophet should be able to perceive God speaking to him even in a vision . He holds that only Moses received a direct message from God . We need not follow Maimonides in his subsequent categories of prophecy . They seem to be formed on the basis of the phrase by which Scripture introduces them to the reader rather than upon any substantial difference of type . However , we may note that such sayings as The word of Jehovah came to him , saying . . . ' appear as a class by themselves . The expression often seems to mean little more than So-and-so was ( divinely ) assured that . . . ' Where it is said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks to him , we are to understand in a vision , ' even in such an instance as the narrative of the sacrifice of Isaac . Thus Maimonides rationalises ancient traditions . It is the imaginative faculty which hears in a prophetic dream the voice of God . The one exception is Moses , who heard the voice of God without the medium of the imaginative faculty . The meaning of Jehovah said unto me ' is always communication by means of a vision even when a long narrative follows . Thus all the symbolic actions of the prophets which were done in the sight of all the people Maimonides relegates to dreams , apparently without perceiving that this would reduce many of Israel 's greatest prophets and teachers to mere writers and recorders of visions . Symbol , metaphor , allegory , hyperbole , exaggeration , are the words he uses to explain some of the most striking events in the lives of the prophets at some of the greatest crises in the history of his people . One can not but feel that at this point the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student of religion than the greatest exponent of orthodox Judaism , though it must be admitted that a fairly recent school of commentators deny that the symbolic acts were ever performed . // His assertion that the prophets ignore intermediate causes , and ascribe the production of all acts to the immediate opera-. tion of God , needs no qualification in modern language ; and the examples he draws from the prophetic writings illustrate the application of this principle from the elements , from the actions of men and of animals , and from what he calls chance . Though he fails to do justice to ancient modes of thought and practice , especially in the realm of divination , and though he does not recognise the great place held by prophetic acts designed to , and believed to , bring about their accomplishment in the future , yet he has a comprehensive view of prophecy . Its origin is divine though its manifestation is sometimes defective and incomplete . It is born of God , brought into being by the will of God operating in the mind and heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by prayer and meditation . It prompts men to acts of heroism , raises leaders , and creates initiative . It inspires writers and teachers , and it is manifest in the priestly office , notably when the sacred lot is cast by the High Priest . Maimonides knows nothing of the modern view of the opposition between priest and prophet . Each in his office possesses the gift of prophecy . For him prophecy is not ended : it is in abeyance , waiting for the coming of Israel 's Messiah . Apart from Moses , who was unique in that he received revelations direct from God , those who saw and heard an angel in a dream were the greatest of the prophets , and in them prophecy is seen in its highest and most perfect form . I have devoted these pages to a survey of Maimonides ' opinions about prophecy , not only because he is the greatest representative of later Hebrew thought ; but also because spiritual insight , rational power , and knowledge of tradition , as they meet in him , are of permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundations of a conservative , reverent criticism among his own people . Naturally , many problems which he could not foresee confront the student of Scripture to-day , but it is not an exaggeration to say that the discussion which he devotes to them is of permanent value . Ibn Khaldun 's incomparable Prolegomena , to which we now turn , covers a much wider field than Maimonides ' study of // prophecy . The purpose of the two books is quite different . The first is a re-statement of Jewish belief in its relation to the philosophy of the Middle Ages which the recovery of Aristotle had thrown into a ferment : the second is a brilliant Introduction to Universal History which surveys all spheres of human thought , and lays bare the principles which , in the author 's view , underlay man 's social and political actions.l Here we are concerned with the great Arab 's views on diviners , magic , talismans , the world of spirits , the significance of dreams , and the difference between the prophet and the diviner . Ibn Khaldun belonged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ninth century . They remained in Seville for some three hundred years , and crossed over to Africa when the power of the Christians in Spain became a danger . Our author was born in 1332 at Tunis , and died at Cairo in 1406 . His learning and scholarship were recognised by his contemporaries in his appointment as Chief Cadi at Cairo . Divination ( kihdna ) , ' he says , is a property peculiar to the human soul.2 The soul is so constituted that it can divest itself of its fleshly integument and rise to a higher spiritual state . Men who belong to the rank of the prophets through their natural dis-position receive as it were a flash ( of intuition ) , and this comes to them without effort on their part , without the aid of sensual means of perception , and without forcing the imagination ; nor need they bring their bodies into play by uttered word or hurried movement . They need employ no artificial means . By divesting themselves of the flesh they put on the angelic state which is natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' 3 // The persons against whom the author inveighs are the dervishes , who , by constant repetition of the name of God , attain a state of trance in which they see visions and some-times utter prophecies . The movements are those of the dance by which a similar state is induced.l Since this capacity belongs to human nature as a whole , ' the author continues , it follows that there must be persons who are logically opposite to the prophets as imperfection is opposed to perfection . Not to seek sensual aids to spiritual perception is the opposite of seeking aid . Logically there must be another class of persons so constituted that their reasoning faculty sets its reflective force in motion through the will which is spurred on by desire ( to attain a spiritual state ) , the intellectual faculty being by nature unequal to the task . Thus they are forced to make use of par-ticular objects of the senses , or of the imagination , such as trans-lucent bodies , the bones of animals , rhymes , and what the behaviour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the help of the sense perception or image to effect the detachment from the normal state which is their object , and it becomes a sort of help and stimulus to them . This faculty which they have ? the funda-mental principle of that perception ? is Divination . ' From these words it is evident that Ibn Khaldun thoroughly understood the psychology of the Arabian diviner . The type of person mentioned in the memoirs of al-Tanukhi 2 was no stranger to him . He finds a clear-cut distinction between the prophets , who pass from a normal state to a state of immediate intuitive perception of things spiritual , and the diviner who has to induce this state by the use of a polished surface ( crystal-gazing ) , a scapula , and so on . But this distinction , as we have seen , is not entirely true of the Hebrew prophets , who were often guided by objects of the senses to prophesy , especially when the object seen suggested by its name some other object or concept . And , contrary to the learned Tunisian 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not been able to examine the early chapters of the Quran systematic-ally , and therefore I must confine myself to two examples , but these are sufficient to establish the fact that Muhammad employed the method of the visible sign in uttering his oracles . In the Io5th Sura Muhammad said : last thou not seen what
