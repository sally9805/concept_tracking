Representative Hamilton ( " Ham " ) Fish Jr . stands six feet three in his stocking feet but prefers to measure his stature by inches of newsprint . Last week , by his own standard , he grew wonderfully tall . <P> Ham Fish was captain of his Harvard football team . During the War his horse was blown up in a stable behind the lines in France , and he wrote an angry letter to his father about " the maggots of pacifism . " Twenty minutes after he first arrived in Congress in 1920 he introduced a resolution providing for the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier . He saw to it that nine towns near his New York State home were provided with captured cannon . He helped organize the American Legion . <P> After all this drumbeating , Ham turned pacifistic . Last spring he proposed a National Committee to Keep America Out of Foreign Wars " to counteract the inspired propaganda which has created mass war hysteria throughout the Nation by inflaming the fears and passions of our people . " In April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end to all this war talk . " In May his committee was offering $100 prizes for essays on " Why America Should Keep Out of Foreign Wars , " and Congressmen were beginning to refer to their alarmed colleague as a " Leader of the Ostrich Bloc . " <P> Month ago , bristling with optimism about the chances of no war , Ham Fish sailed ( as leader of the U. S. delegation of four Senators and 24 Representatives ) for the annual meeting of the Interparliamentary Union at Oslo ( TIME , Sept. 13 , 1937 ) . By the time he reached Berlin , he had to admit having talked with some people ( including British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax and French Premier Edouard Daladier ) who thought there might be a war . " I myself , " he said , " do not believe it , or my family would not be here . " If invited to arbitrate the Danzig dispute , he said , he would gladly accept . <P> But then he had a talk with German Foreign Minister Joachim von @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came away " very depressed . " By the time he had reached Oslo , he was in a towering funk . " My impressions of Europe are terrifying . . . . Europe is drifting toward war . . . . America will go to war ... if the British Fleet is defeated . . . . I believe we can expect war at any moment . . . . August 20 . . . . " <P> Two days later-three days before his deadline-he rose before the Interparliamentarians and , with a wild look in his eye , proposed a 30-day moratorium during which Great Britain , France , Germany and Italy would talk things over ; if the four powers failed , said Ham Fish , the problem should be refered to the Kings of Norway and of the Belgians and the President of Switzerland . <P> The Union gave the U. S. contribution to the War of Nerves a day to cool off , then rejected his proposal . Said Ham Fish , who had in a big way filled the role of U. S. political tout-tourer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of the whole thing . "
