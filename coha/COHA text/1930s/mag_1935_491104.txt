H OMAN ingenuity , after thousands of years of effort , has not yet uncovered the secret of making any direct tax palatable to the taxed , and human nature makes our tax-imposing bodies seek substitutes that will be popular with voters by leaving the majority apparently untaxed . To the legislator , the tax problem has a major phase : lts vote-losing power . Between the public 's self-inflicted blindness and political exigencies , the tax bill grows larger by the minute . Not only have taxes risen but they are becoming more and more discriminatory . The rise may be due to needs which must be met , but discrimination is merely a form of an economic suicidal mania masquerading as social reform . It is human nature for the unemployed to favor the redistribution of wealth . But they are not told what is bound to happen when there are no more rich to tax . Many millions of Americans are today supported by the Government ; which means by the taxpayers . And the beneficiaries talk of their " rights . " They confuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South , East and West , the least unpopular tax appeared to be the income tax , not so much because it was paid by so few but because it was paid by the rich . It is bound to be overexercised because it is levied on dollars and distributed per capita ; which means that the power to boost the surtaxes as desired is in the hands of those who do not pay it . It was everywhere contended that a man must contribute to the cost of government in proportion to his means . When I said that if that were true , nobody should be exempted from paying his share , large or small , I met with violent opposition from wage earners and other income-tax-exempted who swore they could not afford to pay a peony , and from officials who asserted that a tax on small incomes was impracticable because of the cost of collection . Less than 3 per cent of our population file Federal income tax reports out of about 60 per cent of males over twenty-one years of age . Forty per cent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exemption there would be at least 35,000,000 Americans who would pay a tax . The tendency everywhere except in the United States is to lighten the tax burdens of all . With us it is the reverse . That self-interest and political expediency come before justice sounds cynical , but when they come before dollars , it is poor business . Arguments based on economic grounds , the soundness of which can be demonstrated mathematically , were futile . Men who ridiculed the notion that Communism could gain headway in this country could see no danger in confiscatory taxes , even when they admitted that Communism , after all , amounts to little more than a 100 per cent tax on all incomes , since it pools the results of the work of all individuals for the entire community . There must always be a first step . If we begin by despoiling the few for the benefit of the many , the next step must necessarily be the despoilment of all for the benefit of all . The usual answer was that the income tax did n't despoil anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Federal Government began it , and some states are going on the theory that , when in doubt. , it is safe to tax twice . The victims of the increased rates are deprived of the power to fight them , for all deficits incurred for the benefit of the incomeless must he made up by the payers of the taxes , in life and even in death . ( Continued an Page 82 ) 82 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST February 23,1033 " I only thought ? " lie ventured again . " Ah , yes , to be sure , " she recalled at last , and smiled condescendingly . " What is it , Mr. Milliken ? " " I was just wondering , " Mr. Milliken reminded her apologetically , " if you were going to write your name on my picture , Miss Leslie . " Ill M R. MILLIKEN leaned back on the hard leather Pullman seat , braced an elbow on the jiggling sill beside him , and glanced about the empty washroom cautiously . With a furtive smile he reached in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully , and held up a faded photograph . He released the clasp of his folded glasses and balanced them on the bridge of his nose . " ' With very best regards , ' ' ' he road half aloud , in a dreamy voice , " ' Lorna Leslie . ' " He started guiltily at a step in the passageway , and crammed the photograph back into his pocket . The porter entered , stared at him a minute , and then beamed in cordial recognition . " Well , sah , of you ain ' back again It was obvious that the average man was convinced that the rich deliberately evade paying their income taxes through trickery and dishonest subterfuges and that all corporations are against all taxes . When I ventured to say that an income tax meant a tax on income and nothing more , and that there were times when very rich men might not have taxable incomes , the usual retort was : " They are millionaires , are n't they ? They admitted before the Senate Committee that they paid nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They merely felt . They all had read , months before , the same newspaper dispatches from Washington . Congressmen have never deemed it expedient to make clear to their constituents the difference between " evasion " and " avoidance , " possibly because the blame for " evasions " must fall on the man who wrote the laws . The President denounced income-tax dodgers for disregarding the " spirit " of the law and for observing only the " letter " of it . It has long been well established by the courts that a tax law is necessarily all " letter . " It must be so construed . It has no collateral moral implications . A tax law is a measure exclusively designed to raise revenue . It is no part of a citizen 's moral or patriotic duty to pay more than the law specifically says he must . Nobody thinks of paying ton dollars for a hat when the seller asks him to pay five dollars . The point that seemed to linger longer in the memory of the average citizen was that Mr. J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this country and admitted that he paid one in England . " Well , " I explained , " in England the income tax does not consider capital gains and losses . In this country we do . You fellows ignore the fact that Mr. Morgan 's firm paid many millions of dollars in 1929 when he had large capital gains in addition to his other income . A fine law ! In 1931 , when ho had more capital losses than profits , hefrom Hollywood already 1 Did you get to see Lorna Leslie ? " " You bet I did ! " said Mr. Milliken proudly . " I was with her for almost a whole afternoon . " " Is ' at a lac ' ! " said the porter . " Did she write on yo ' picture ? " Triumphantly Mr. Milliken produced the signed photograph . " I do n't think she 'll ever realize how much she did for me that afternoon , " he said humbly . " This means more to me than anything else in the world . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , " he beamed . " I mailed a letter to the studio the other day , and they sent me a picture of her too . She even wrote on it for me . " He fished in the pocket of his white jacket and took out an envelope . " See what she wrote on mine . " Mr. Milliken adjusted his glasses and hold the second signed photograph beside his own . Across the bottom , in Lorna 's flowing hand , he read : " With best regards , Lorna Leslie . " For a moment his hand trembled , and he gulped . He took a deep breath and looked up confidently . " She did n't say ' very , ' " said Mr. Milliken. had no taxable income on which to pay . That was n't patriotic , was it ? The law said he did not have to pay a cent , and he did n't . That was a crime , was n't it ? What happens is that the tax on capital gains is fine in fat years and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress , assumes that because Al Capone went to jail because he did n't pay an income tax , all millionaires are just so many Al Capones still at large . When a rich man declares that he paid no income tax last year because he lost more than he gained , you sneer because you see him riding about in expensive cars and still living in his palatial mansion and still paying wages to a lot of help . He did all this because he paid no income tax . " Usually the reply was that all rich men hire experts to show them how to get around the law . If I told a man that if he bought stocks or bonds today and sold them tomorrow at a profit , he had to pay an income tax , but if he bought them today and sold them tomorrow at a loss , lie could not claim a loss on his tax return , the answer was that sales to establish a loss always violated the " spirit " of the law . England , with its much older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has recognized the justice of applying income-tax laws over a longer period than we do . There they not only permit but they expect the taxpayers to take every advantage possible under the law . With us now , a man who earns $50,000 net one year and pays his income tax and then loses $100,000 the following year and pays nothing will find , when he figures his net income for the two years , that although he has run his business at a loss of $50,000 during that time , he has had to pay an income tax on $50,000 . That is considered one way to plug loopholes . It is fair to say that the heavy burden borne by the owners of real property has done a great deal to make legislators regard the income tax as offering the easiest way to help those who now pay excessive real-estate taxes . Sympathy for ( Continued on Page 851 ( Corttioluyel from Papa 82 ) the farmer , for the hard-working clerk who , unfortunately , owns his home , I found everywhere . But nobody could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice . Some states had to do it because no other tax could be levied without meeting with violent Oposition . A-merchant in a small town in the Middle to told me : " Millionaires ought to be taxed still more . " We were riding through a small village . On the oittskirts stood a magnificent school building , large enough to accommodate not only the children but the entire adult giopulation , with room to spare . ? " Some school , " I said . The Dellnquent.Tax Problem ? We drove on past farmhouses and barns , not too close together .. III-low can they pay for that school ? " , I asked . ? The storekeeper merely pointed to a large barn . ? " How much do you think that farm is , taxed for ? " he asked me . I shook my head . " Ten dollars an acre ! " He almost shouted in his indignation . " How can it stand it ? " " It ca n't ! Most of the farm land in Central Iowa is taxed about $3.50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only farmers who get by are those who are not mortgaged and have no interest to pay and have grown-up sons and daughters who help work it . The poor devils who paid 3200 an acre and up and still owe half of it ca n't make both ends meet . The interest and the tax leave nothing for them to live on . That is-why those who have big incomes ought to pay . " A week later , one of the largest real-estate owners in an Eastern resort , to whom I spoke about the delinquent-tax lists everywhere , asserted that the trouble was all due to political organizations . He did n't blame real-estate owners for not paying taxes when they had no money to pay them with . " I will not pay taxes on my real estate . Yes , I have the money , but the political gang here wo n't be ousted until the taxpayers get mad enough . I am helping to infuriate them . Taxes on my real estate are a business proposition with me . Many municipalities are offering rebates to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If I can reduce the expenses of running my apartment houses and office buildings by waiting , why not wait ? All I propose to do is to pay when it is cheapest to do so . " The delinquent-tax problem can only be solved by clean and efficient government . We could balance our budget , meet our obligations , reduce realty taxes and benefit everybody . Common sense is considered fantastic in this country today . " I suspect that thousands of realty owners feel as he does . Perhaps that is one of the reasons why others are taxed twice and even three times . In common justice , it may be said that real estate pays proportionately three times as much in taxes as any other form of wealth . - At a New York club , last spring , I mot a distinguished foreigner whose opinions on men and affairs often appear in print . " I have visited this country before and I have known many Americans , here and abroad . I 've always considered them aggressive , vigorous , practical and highly individualistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never been , and are not today , as difficult to envisage or to solve as those of Europe . But your politics are difficult for us to understand , As a people , you have youth , vast resources , huge wealth and the American spirit , and yet , you do not fight to hold what you own , Your rich men do not fight to keep their riches , in the amassing of which they may have sacrificed much that we older and less vigorous Europeans esteem so high/a , . Your bankers fear to plead ' guilty of being bankers and they let the politicians puncture their money bags . Your workingmen fail to grasp the fact that their duty in helping to bring about a recovery is a matter of life and death and not of union recognition or controlled industry . " To me , it is inexplicable how , as a people , you refuse to take arms against the common enemy . Industrial leaders fight defensively instead of offensively . Labor leaders are largely concerned with obtaining more dues for their organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of profits derived from the combined efforts by both labor and capital might perhaps reasonably be demanded and obtained . But you seem less interested in the competency of your general than in his salary . Suppose Grant had been placed in command of the Northern Army in 1861 instead of McClellan and had shortened your Civil War by two years . Would his salary have been excessive at $1,000,000 a year ? As individuals , you have developed a desire to tax the other man without studying what the tax may cost everybody . Only the amount the Government collects interests those who have the spending of it . That is not the American way of conducting private business . Efficiency and common sense are urged everywhere except in the Government , which is everybody 's business . Taxes clearly defeat the purpose for which they are levied when business is taxed beyond the point at - which it will pay to do business . But you first appropriate billions and then tax . You ca n't balance budgets with bookkeeping chickens that do n't hatch or that cost more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Postmaster General of Australia , speaking last April before the British Luncheon Club of New York , said : " When Australia was in a perilous position , with a ? 40,000,000 deficit , we adopted the ' Premiers ' Plan , ' based on the simple principle that before you obtain money , you must earn it . Government salaries were cut , interest rates on the internal debt reduced , the bank interest rate lowered to help the mortgage situation , and additional taxes were levied . We have now wiped out the deficit and abolished the additional taxes , in the belief that this , rather than increasing grants to the unemployed , would make industry extend its operations and a feeling of confidence be restored . " Two days later , Mr. Neville Chamberlain , IChancellor of the Exchequer , in his budget speech before the House of Commons , announced his proposal to lower the income tax . Ho asserted that the relief which would confer the most direct benefit on the country , and have the greatest psychological effect and impart the most immediate stimulus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standard rate of the income tax . Australia and Great Britain have found that soaking the rich may kill EVENING POST without curing . The so-called redistribution of wealth through taxation does not distribute . It destroys . The tax law that makes the rich man poor does not make the poor man rich . I sought an old friend  --  a Wall Street man who has made money by studying mon , measures and conditions , playing fair and backing his judgment . " How do you feel about the rising tide of income-tax rates ? " I asked him . He hesitated a full minute . But his self-control was perfect and he answered calmly : " In all seriousness and sincerity , without reservations of any kind , I give you my word of honor that if the Government were to come to me and say : ' We propose to confiscate all you own in the world and in return we shall pay you $2000 a year in cash and take care of your dependents , ' I would accept the offer instantly and gratefully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , I do not mean that I do not spend more . My real expenses consist of providing for a large number of dependents of various sorts in my home and in my office . I am always told that the rich must hear the greater part of the tax burden , irrespective of the number of people whose livelihood depends upon their efforts . There are many men and women who work for wages because I work for wages . My own motor is five years old , but my two stenographers have had a new car every year . I suppose that proves I must underpay them in order to keep on being rich . " During the past year or two , I have spoken with dozens of friends who provide incomes for many hundreds of people . Most of them feel as I do  --  a longing to throw up the sponge . My own individual wants , as I have said before , are modest enough , even if you have been good enough to admire this place of mine . And what deters me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously sensible thing ? Why do n't we take it easier , when the more we earn the more we have to give up ? Why let the Government cut down my expenses when I could do it myself much more comfortably ? " Well , if I stop making money for myself and the Government , I simply stop making it for others . It is n't a financial , but a morhl consideration . Good Christians who think of me as a rich man would not believe this . Thirty families are directly and absolutely dependent upon me for their living . In taking From me more and more of my earned income , the Government is doing its best to deprive these people of their wages . I have spent on my house and gardens some hundreds of thousands of dollars , 90 per cent of which was spent for labor . The people I paid , in turn paid taxes and helped others to pay taxes . For years what I earned has helped the community . I shall be unable in the future to do as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys often ask me whether I think I have a right to own such an estate . I had rather suspected I had the same right to live in this house that my gardener had to live in his nice cottage , the same right that nature gives to man when it makes Paderewskis as well as cabaret key thumpers . If all men could really be taxed in proportion to their means , nobody would be either undertaxed or overtaxed . But we are not . " My not . income during the last twenty years has amounted to several THE SATURDAY millions of dollars . I worked hard for it . I had my accountant figure the other day how much I would have had left. , net , had the present surtaxes been in effect during the past decade or two . Lumping my income , I find I would be in the red over a million . My real problem today consists of deciding whether to stay in business during the next twenty years and inevitably go bankrupt , or quit now and let thirty families find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to earn enough to keep my business going and provide for a reserve to take care of emergencies . " Against Common Sense " You know that I am not what the newspapers would consider rich enough to be a danger to the community , and yet I paid more in income taxes for 1933 than all of North Dakota . An excessive income tax is against common sense , as it is against common justice . Only so long as a citizen retains the right to sell his goods or his services in the highest , market we need not fear Communism . The manufacturer , with goods to sell , understands this . The workingman , with service to sell , understands it as it applies to his own wages , but not to his employer 's profits . And yet Congress insists upon regulating by statute the human urge to sell in the highest market . " A vicious thing about a major tax on incomes is that it presupposes a return on capital , which is based on the theory that money by itself will make money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general  --  for the entire community  --  and it also assumes that the average return upon the average capital invested is large . These assumptions are incorrect . The average return , or yield , for money over long periods is probably far too small to support a tax of nearly three-fourths of 1 per cent . All our income and estate taxes are levied on the apparent and not on the real return on capital . But not one man in ten thousand will believe that it is highly unprofitable to himself and all of his neighbors to soak the rich that he reads about , who make so much money without working . The redistribution of wealth is a pleasant-sounding phrase , but the accepted connotations are utterly false . One of the original thinkers I have found among economists , Charles N. Edge , with whom I spoke on this subject , answered : " How greatly the true return on capital differs from the apparent return can only be shown by a concrete example : " In 1900 an insurance company wished to show the beauty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in actual fact and not by mathematical tables , that the sum of $100 in gold invested at 4 per cent would grow in thirty-four years to the sum of $380 in gold . They realized that in practice , to achieve this result , no unforeseen error , bankruptcy , fraud or confiscation could be allowed to happen . Their experimental investment fund was $700 , which they decided to invest as safely as human mind could conceive at that date , 1900 . They therefore deposited $100 at 4 per cent interest in each of the Government postal-savings banks of the seven richest countries in the world  --  the United States , Great Britain , Franca , Italy , Germany , Russia and Japan  --  each country guaranteeing principal and interest in gold . By 1934 the $100 in gold invested in the United States , EVENING POST compounded for thirty-four years , had become not $380 but only $228 in gold ; in CI reat Britain not $380 but only S239 ; in Franco not $380 but only $77 ; in Italy not $380 but only $108 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $380 but nought ; in Japan not $380 but $138 . The total sum invested , $700 in gold , had not become 82060 in gold but only $700 . " The insurance company is bitterly disappointed with its experiment , for the $700 gold , compounded at the apparent interest rate of 4 per cent for thirty-four years , has only grown to $790 in gold , which is a compound-interest rate of less than three-tenths of 1 per cent . In actual practice it can almost truly be said that gold is sterile and the return is nought . " What is commonly mistaken for the return on money is return upon the management of money . Ultraconservative Americans bought Governmeiat bonds that yielded less than 4 per cent because they felt they were the safest investment in the world . They were beyond harm by the ordinary risks of business and other natural enemies of wealth . These cautious patriots invested gold dollars worth 100 cents . Today the principal and interest are payable in sixty-cent dollars . The apparent return is the same . The real return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bondholder do without his 4 per cent interest to make up what he has lost ? Ten , or more , when the interest is only 33/2 per cent . The savings-bank calculations measure what the depreciation in the currency in the seven countries has done to the savings and the difference between the apparent and the true return . Money Does Not Make Money Now , there have always been wise investors , shrewd men who gave careful thought to their investment problems . Yet it is clear that no fortune has grown as it logically should have done if there were only the interest rate to consider . In other words , there is a natural growth of wealth which is not determined either by the theoretical interest rate or by human foresight . If it is clear that money by itself , however wisely invested , does not make money , then an income tax rewards the idle , sterile or unprofitable use of money . The public always has and always must carry the burden of the Government . Today we ask taxpayers who pay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government . Education at the expense of the Government benefits many more poor people than rich . The benefits of government , theref ore , are shared by the rich man only after sharing them with all other members of society . Instead of coming first , the rich man really comes last , but the average man finds it diffi-cult to admit that those who pay taxes on their wealth give to the poor , who do n't pay , those things that the poor could not obtain with their own money . It was Mr. Charles N. Edge who stated the axiom : " Prosperity is not bought with dollars . It is bought with work . " It would help the entire country if more Americans could be brought to realize this truth . Increased profits would mean more work for more people , and unemployment would be reduced . The way of creating wealth can not be changed suddenly without inflicting hardship on everybody . The first three generations under Communism , for example , are bound to suffer greatly , and the standards of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under individualism like ours . Because of the tendency to tax the same thing twice and even three times , I found everywhere an urgent demand for what might be called the standardization of methods for tax collecting . Where one corporation head insisted that taxes must be lowered if business is to survive , I found a hundred who merely asked for a reduction in the cost of paying them . The High Cost of Returns A high authority has estimated that it costs the taxpayers of the United States in excess of $400,000,000 a year merely to prepare the returns necessary in paying the income taxes required by the Federal Government , The head of the legal department of a large corporation asserted that the cost of ascertaining the tax liability in the various states , including local taxes , is still greater . I did not believe it , but my authority is unimpeachable . It seemed more than incredible that the need of legal advice , the preparation of complicated reports , the study and enforcement Of all sorts of regulations , the clerical help and work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the country 's yearly tax bill . And the height of this absurdity is that the Government benefits so little by it . Corporations doing an interstate business assert that the cost of complying with the regulations when a certain tax does not . amount . to more than $250 is at least four times as much as the tax . The cost of determining the necessary data often exceeds the amount received by the states . Thousands of taxpayers now hope that the Federal Government may soon undertake to collect sales taxes and allocate to each state its fair share . The old issue of state rights is promptly raised when such a plan is suggested , although , as a matter of fact , no state would abrogate its rights to levy such taxes , but merely enter into a co-operative agreement to have Uncle Sam do the collecting and thereby save the millions that come out of the taxpayers ' pockets and do not go into the treasuries of the states . What is contemplated is not the federalization of the taxes , but the federalization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . The treasurer of a corporation in charge of the payment of the tax bills laughed in my face when I asked him how he liked the sales tax . " It is far more serious than the public realizes , because it goes even beyond the general desire to punish wicked corporations and unfair practices . We dare not complain so long as legislators and public are certain that the main business of all corporations is to evade their taxes . Being a small concern , we only have to prepare a little more than 300 documents . We do a small business in an Eastern state . I figured the tax return strictly in accordance with the requirements of the law . But the tax commission was not satisfied . We were compelled to answer a questionnaire , showing in complete detail all our transactions for the year . It took twenty-five , single-spaced , typewritten pages to do this , to say nothing of numerous letters . It cost us $2000 to comply with the commission 's demands . We finally received the correct amount due on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Incidentally , this was exactly what we had figured we owed when we submitted our first report . " ( Continued on Page 88 ) " LiFE INSURANCE should hring securityand peace of mind , ' ' writes Mr. Batt . " For that reason I deliberately sought a sound , conservative company . " My research showed such a record of fidelity of purpose , of conservative management , and of sound progress in the case of the Mutual Benefit that I did not hesitate to place my insurance with it . The passing years only serve to confirm my judgment " The Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company has always insisted on absolute financial security  --  with the result of an unbroken series of dividend payments and a very low net cost of insurance . But it has also led the way in administering life insurance for the benefit of the policyholder . It has progressively increased the benefits offered in its contracts , and has made these benefits available to old policyholders , insofar as possible . It has a noteworthy record of considering moral as well as purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a result , you will share the feeling of satisfaction as you , too , choose the Mutual Benefit . Continued from Page 86 ) Mr. J. W. Oliver , an experienced business man who is one of the country 's leading exports on taxation , expressed his views on present trends ; The increase in the cost of government since the World War has made legislators attempt to appease their constituents by approving laws taxing large corporations and incomes . They have succeeded chiefly in increasing the cost of doing business , with little relief to real property owners . Nobody objects to shifting an unfair burden , provided it is fairly and intelligently shifted . Instead , we have today numerous complex formulas for measuring the tax on businesses engaged in both interstate and intrastate sales . The cost of administration has risen more rapidly than the revenues . Seventeen states , comprising more than one-half of the population of the United States , now have some form of retail sales tax within the state . It calls for a collection of the tax from every little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is never collected . Tax evasion by the small shops places a penalty on honesty . The states can afford to audit the large establishments ; they can not bother with the small . " Costly Taxgathering " Business men throughout the country believe that the Federal Government should be the sole collecting agency of liquor , gasoline and tobacco taxes and a manufacturers ' excise tax to take the place of all sales taxes and all other forms of business taxes , though not including taxation of banks , insurance companies and public utilities . Simplification of the method . of collecting the taxes would reduce the cost to taxpayers as well as to the Government by hundreds of millions . I could tell you amazing stories showing how much harm the different states ' sales taxes work on corporations and persons engaged in interstate business . The objections to a federalized plan of tax collection tare based on the alleged violation of the sovereign rights of the states and on the difficulty of allocating fairly the apportionable revenue to the individual states . The tax departments of corporations also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my friends favor basing the allocation on population , while others would figure on consumption . Consumption per capita , of course , can not be determined to the penny . Tentative plans provide that of the taxes collected , one-hall of the proportion reserved for the states should be distributed on the basis of population and one-half on the basis of assessed values of property , as compiled by the United States Census Bureau . Some tax commissioners oppose the federalization plan an the ground that the present agitation comes exclusively from corporations that maintain expensive legal departments in order to find ways to evade taxes . This criticism shows how little certain natures are affected by the troubles of the taxpayers . The danger of being ruled by a bureaucracy at Washington may exist . But it would be better and cheaper than forty-eight bureaucracies . It is common sense to consider how much would be gained and not how little might be lost . " The Goose and the Golden Eggs Mr. Mark Graves , Tax Commissioner of the State of New York , believes that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the most important tax problems before the country . Greatly reduced tax yields and increased demands for relief and recovery purposes growing out of the depression , together with the growing tendency of the Federal and state governments to levy taxes on the same taxpaying abilities , make the need of prompt action imperative . Levying too high personal or corporate income taxes by the Federal Government , Mr. Graves believes , would Limit to nominal amounts the revenue which the states would derive . Should the states lay relatively heavy personal and corporation income taxes in addition to the high Federal taxes ; on the same objects , the revenue yields of both would suffer , just as high state taxes on tobacco , liquor and other commodities reduce the consumption and , consequently , the revenues . In Mr. Graves ' opinion , the taxpayers are the victims of the lack of planning by government " The costs of providing the services required of a given unit of government may bear no relation to its ability to levy and administer taxes sufficient to defray such costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should he performed by that unit of government which can best and most economically administer it , and a tax should be administered by that unit of government which can most efficiently and economically , both for the government and for the taxpayers , levy and collect such tax . In actual practice , this is seldom the case , so that the taxing unit will in some eases have to share some part of the proceeds of a given tax with other governmental units . " The problem is to devise a method of financing all government in this country by laying taxes which will spread the aggregate tax load as evenly and fairly as possible over the various taxpaying abilities and other objects of taxation . "
