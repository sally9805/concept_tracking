Mathematical physicists use the same three tools commonly employed by novelists and amateur race track bettors : pencil , paper and imagination . One who wields these tools brilliantly is Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac of Cambridge University , who won a Nobel Prize in 1933 for his powerful contributions to atomic theory and who is one of the half-dozen greatest mathematical logicians in the world . In the U. S. last week arrived the British journal Nature with an article by Dr. Dirac which he began as follows : <P> " The fundamental constants of physics , such as c the velocity of light , h Planck 's constant , e the charge and m the mass of the electron , and so on , provide for us a set of absolute units for measurement of distance , time , mass , etc . There are , however , more of these constants than are necessary for this purpose , with the result that certain dimensionless numbers can be constructed from them . " <P> Dr. Dirac then proposed to construct a new universe out of the leftovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington , had arrived at theoretical values for certain constants , such as the quantity of matter in the universe ( using the proton as a unit ) and the ratio of the electric to the gravitational force between proton and electron . These two Eddington values worked out at **27;593;TOOLONG ( 10 multiplied by itself 77 times ) and **27;622;TOOLONG . Although , as Dirac says , " Eddington 's arguments are not always rigorous , " they nevertheless gave him " the feeling that they are probably substantially correct in the case of the smaller numbers . " But **27;651;TOOLONG and **27;680;TOOLONG looked so large that Dirac had difficulty regarding them as constants at all . <P> Dirac took a short-time scale figure for the age of the universe , expressed it in terms of the atomic constant e/mc3 . The figure turned out to be approximately the same as Eddington 's **27;709;TOOLONG . The square of the universe 's age would therefore be equal to Eddington 's other figure , **27;738;TOOLONG . Armed with these two fine coincidences , Dirac next proposed to dispense with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrical to gravitational force between proton and electron equals t , the age of the universe , and the amount of universal matter equals t . But the universe is not getting any younger . Thus the values dependent on t and t are not constants at all , but get bigger with the passage of time . The quantity of universal matter would increase proportionately to the square of the universal age . The electrogravity ratio would increase in proportion to the age itself , but increase of the ratio would diminish its gravitational denominator . <P> Result : A universe which is slowly acquiring more matter , but whose matter is slowly losing " weight " so that the effective mass remains the same .
