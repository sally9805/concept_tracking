One day last fortnight , 5,000 wounded German soldiers arrived in Berlin from the Polish front . Only a handful of doctors and nurses were at the station to help them , and there were neither stretchers nor ambulances enough to go around . Aided by scores of " Hitler girls , " the bandaged men were bundled into busses , trucks and taxis , driven to hospitals already overcrowded . <P> Five days later , notices were posted at the German consulate in Antwerp , begging doctors " of German nationality regardless of race " to come home at once . The posters promised that , because of a serious shortage of physicians , all returning refugees would be immediately repatriated and paid back their confiscated fortunes to the last pfennig . To date , no answers have been received from the 3,000 Jewish doctors who escaped from the Reich .
