txt . WASHINGTON , Oct. ** Roosevelt , like his distinguished fellow-alumnus of Harvard , T. S. Eliot , is a master of ellipsis . And that is probably the principal reason why his fireside chats , like Mr. Eliot 's poem , " The Waste Land , " are the topic of such controversy , and the occasion for such diametrically opposed opinions . That is perhaps the reason why a liberal newspaper , a supporter of his policies , could go to press last Monday morning with an almost indignant commentary on significant omissions in his radio address of the night before , while at least two very conservative journals could pat him kindly on the back and thank him for the " reassurance " he gave to the business community . For months the business community , through its acknowledged mouthpiece , the Chamber of Commerce of the United States , has been imploring Mr. Roosevelt , obliquely and directly , to say something " reassuring , " and into that one vague adjective has been read whatever meaning the individual desired . When a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not going to kill you " ; " I 'm not going to cut off both legs  --  only one " ; " I 'm not going to give you any more castor oil " ; or " I think I 've doctored you enough now  --  suppose we try neglect for a while " ? Undoubtedly there were large blocks in the business world desirous of each of these answers  --  some of the more importunate , perhaps , desiring all of them  --  from " Dr. " Roosevelt . Replies to Patient 's Plaints . But what answer did he give them Sunday night in this " report to the nation " which they had hoped would contain " reassurances " ? A summary of the patient 's complaints would read somewhat as follows : 1 ? He wants to go back to the gold standard . 2 ? He wants the budget balanced . ( A ) ? . As a means to this end he wants the Public Works Administration 's expenditures chopped off right below the ears . 3 ? He wants the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtailment meanwhile of the activities of the Recovery Administration . 4 ? He wants the rigid regulation of securities iss- nce modified or abolished . 5 ? He wants an affidavit that the dollar will not be further devalued . 6 ? He wants to know exactly what medicine , if any , and preferably none , the doctor proposes to give him during the next two years . What " assurances " along this line did he get last Sunday night ? 1 ? To the clamor of the patient for a return to the gold standard , the good doctor gave an oblique refusal by pointing to the course pursued by England in similar circumstances . 2 ? To the Cemand that the budget be balanced , he replied indirectly by citing the need for continued emergency expenditures . ( A ) ? In this connection he defended expenditures for public works as a means of re-employment and relief of suffering . 3 ? To the insistence that the National Industrial Recovery Act be modifed and the NRA curbed , he did go so far as to cite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added significantly that the NRA codes were to a great extent the work of the business community itself . 4 ? To the appeals for modification or abolition of securities regulation he replied firmly in the negative , even going so far as to say that the patient was " enjoying " his medicine . 5 ? The doctor did not even hear what the patient said about further devaluation of the dollar . 6 ? As to his future prescriptions for the patient , he said in effect : " You 'll get what I think is good for you . " Specifically , he said : " I believe with Abraham Lincoln , that ' the legitimate object of government is to do for a cdmmunity of people whatever they need to have done but can not do at all or can not do so well for themselves in their separate and individual capacities . ' " Actually , there is a strong impression in Washington that President Roosevelt and the administration generally , liberals and conservatives alike , are somewhat impatient with the election-year clamor for abandonment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These men are said to feel that a program interrupted in the middle is worse than wasted , and that a great deal of the criticism that gets into print is inspired by selfish motives . Part a it , they believe , is political , part of it based on a resurgent desire for what Herbert Hoover calls freedom and what Henry A. Wallace calls freebooting , and part on honest convictions of sin- 1 cere men . The latter group they respect , but while respecting it they profess themselves unable to understand what the shooting is all about . Close observers who have been watching the Treasury during what is conceded to have been an extremely trying period , when cranks and crackpots were proclaiming the merits of every conceivable snakebite remedy , have nothing but praise for the manner in which it has kept its head . They point to the orthodox methods of financing , the steady resistance to half-baked schemes , the release of gold to sustain the dollar and the cautious use of the powers conferred by the Silver Act . They note that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maintenance of whose wealth depends upon a continuation of fiscal orthodoxy . They are convinced that there will be no further devaluation of the dollar and that there will be no wild silver inflation . What annoys those responsible for the administration 's recovery measures more than anything else , however , is the feeling that industry has been for some months in effect on strike . There is a feeling that when business asks for reassurance it is really asking for something much bigger than that ambiguous word is generally taken to mean  --  that it is asking for a jettisoning of part of the administration 's program . End of Experimenting Seen . For the reassurance of business , however , it may be said that indi1 cations point to an early end of experimentation . The President is of an inquisitive and peculiarly daring temperament when it comes to trying an experiment , but there is the feeling right now that the end is in sight , that the administration believes it has to a large extent achieved a position where a sound conduct of the measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An exception must be made in the matter of so-called " social legislation , " and perhaps of banking legislation designed to strengthen further the financial structure of the country . The one possible fly in this ointment is what Congress may attempt in further public works expenditures . The PWA has put out most of the money it has at hand , beyond the funds to be realized from the gradual sale to the RFC of the municipal bonds it holds as collateral . The field of profitable non-Federal public works is reported to have been pretty well covered , and a continuation of aid tci current projects is said to be about all that can now be considered urgent . But projects have been rejected for want of satisfactory security or of satisfactory assurance that they are inherently sound . Will Congress pass an omnibus public works bill legislating hundreds of those projects into existence as a further drain on the Treasury ? And if it does , will the President be able to resist the eager horde when it gets a whiff of pork ? That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require considerable delicate handling .
