txt With a considerable volume of - near maturities to handle , the Treasury is likely some time in the near future to issue some bonds to pull in a portion of these short term issues and also possibly to refund at lower interest rates , convertible bonds . While December 15 appears to be the most propitious time to convert , it is also possible that on September 15 , or shortly thereafter , the Treasury might provide a note or small bond issue to take up some of the bills and securities . - It may be stated that for the present , officials see no compulsion moving them toward such a. step . There appears at present no prospect for an appreciable rise in money rates . The government has lately been borrowing money for around .4 of 1% on 91 day bills . So long as cheap funds remain available , officials will be inclined to take advantage of them to save the Treasury as much in interest costs as possible . The government is actually in a position to make a profit on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest rates alone are concerned . The Corporation has been making loans to banks at around 5%% , and has been paying the Treasury 31,42% on its notes . The Treasury has been borrowing on bills at less than half of one per cent interest and on certificates from 1%70 to over 2% and 3% ? Volume Offers Problem What will bring officials to a decision to offer a bond - issue , however , will be the large volume of near maturities which has accumulated and will continue to pile up so long as the Treasury intervenes in the market on behalf of the Reconstruction Finance Corp . There are now about $650,000.000 in bills , ** 000 in certificates , and about 1,900,000,000 in notes outstanding . it must be borne in mind , however , that not all the certificates and notes could easily be converted and taken ' lip into a bond issue . Most of the notes run from two to four years , and the ' nearest lingua is one of about ; 500.000.000. 314,56 maturing next December 15 . In addition there are sass.000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converted in December . If the Treasury should decide to convert these 434. s by December " 15 , it Would have to give notice on September 15 , the next interest payment and call date . This suggests December 15 as a likely date for a conversion . At the same time that lower interest bearing bonds might be exchanged for the 4iis. the Treasury by a new bond issue could raise funds for paying off the $600,000,000 in notes , and probably , ? some additional to reduce the outstanding volume of bills and ' securities . There are no certificates maturing December 15 , and probably it will not be sought to curtail drastically the amount of certificates . To Continue Certificates The present volume of about f2.500.000,000 of these is much larger than is necessary to offset tax payments , but the Treasury will continue to use the certificates in more than normal amounts , it is believed , because they provide a balance in the spreads of various maturities while borrowing is taking place on such a large scale . There is the additional possibility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sold for 3% or under , the Issue of 32 , fi% bonds outstanding in the amount of $1,392,000,000 Might also be converted at whatever was the lower rates . However , it is not yet hoped for quite such a low rate . Treasury will have about $314,000,000 of 1%% certificates and nearly $400,000,000 of 3% certificates to pay off on September 15 . Interest payments will probably be not particularly high for that date . On October 15 an additional $333,000,000 of certificates mature . Against this the Treasury will probably receive around $150,000,000 of interest payments and by September excise taxes should be fairly large . The excise taxes could probably pay off the October 15 maturity without providing funds on the September 15 financing to meet them . Also , these excise tax receipts will tend to provide some funds for the maturing issues around the tax date . However , additional new funds will probably be needed for the R. P. C. Under the circumstances theTreasury will probably , issue another series of two of certificates or not more than the September 15 maturity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , officials may decide to put out a small amount of certificates and provide the balance of the funds in notes of two years or more and possibly take in some other near maturities .
