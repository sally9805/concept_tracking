A transparent water flea called Daphnia magna has had a lot of flattering things said about it by Professor Arno Viehoever of the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy &; Science . " This little animal has a divine simplicity that is miraculous , " Professor Viehoever never tires of telling . " It is seemingly a primitive form of life until studied . Its fundamental biological responses are very similar to ours . It has nervous , digestive , circulatory , respiratory , optic and reproductive systems , and the beauty of it is that the animal is perfectly transparent so you can see everything that is happening , from the digestion of its food and the beating of its heart to the working of its eye . " <P> Daphnia , a one-fourth inch relative of lobsters and crabs , can live in ten drops of water . It is small enough for its whole body to be studied through a microscope and transparent enough to be projected upon a magic lantern screen ( see cut , p. 32 ) . These qualities make Daphnia a fine biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized . For Professor Viehoever , Daphnia solved an important strychnine puzzle , he enthusiastically told the American Association for the Advancement of Science at Denver this week . This bitter , crystalline product of nux vomica is used as a tonic , stimulant and antidote in medicine . The effects of strychnine have long been unpredictable , even when the drug is manufactured strictly according to the U. S. Pharmacopeia . After diligent tests on rats , manufacturing druggists gave up hope of producing an utterly reliable strychnine . But Professor Viehoever tried many brands of the drug on Daphnia and in every instance he produced identical convulsions , paralysis , death . Good strychnine , he concluded , is invariable . The trouble lies with the people , animals and insects who react variously to the drug . <P> Professor Viehoever is as interesting as Daphnia . He is a terror to his family , who never know what noisome creature or substance he may pull from his pockets . The U. S. entered the War a few weeks before he , a German , could become naturalized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bureau of Chemistry at the University of Illinois . Back in Washington , he composed The Doughboys March , which the U. S. Army band at Fort Washington , Md. , near where he has a farm and summer home , still plays . Professor Viehoever 's laboratory , where a pet white kitten dabbles in his bowls of Daphnia , is in a red-brick house next to the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy &; Science 's garden . He likes to recall that this garden , surrounded by a high spiked fence , was planted by the late Dr. Frederick B. Kilmer , a trustee of the college and father of the poet who wrote Trees .
