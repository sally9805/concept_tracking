Brain Sweat ( by John Charles Brownell ; produced by James Montgomery &; Henry R. Stern ) . The season 's most disagreeable title cloaks one of the few straight Negro comedies ever produced on Broadway . Inoffensive and in spots disarmingly merry . Brain Sweat is concerned with Henry Washington 's " projeck . " Henry ( fat , benign Billy Higgins , nightclub comedian ) has not done a lick of work in two years . While his wife and son support him , he has been content to wear a fine patina on the seat of his rocking chair and cogitate means of making some easy money . " Brain sweatin ' , ' ' explains Henry , " is de wus ' kind of sweatin ' . " <P> As the comic trials of Henry 's long-suffering wife ( able Rose McClendon of Porgy ) increase , as Henry 's sister-in-law becomes increasingly acidic on the subject of Henry 's laziness , not a few spectators may be reminded of those unpretentious little Irish genre comedies of the Abbey Players . The parallelism goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have gone off despondently and drowned himself . Needless to say , Henry reappears , alive and happy in a store-bought suit and brown derby , his " projeck " a success . First-week audiences seemed immensely pleased when Henry outwitted his onetime white employer , sold for $10,000 an option on some land which had only cost him $1,000 . Magniloquently , Henry gives his patient wife a thousand , his gambling brother-in-law another thousand , his son still another ( no one in the cast had seemed fazed when it was announced that his son 's little fiancee was pregnant ) . " And Henry , " the darktown financier addresses himself , " hyeah 's seven thousan ' fo you . " <P> Moor Born ( by Dan Totheroh ; George Bushar &; John Tuerk , producers ) . The success of Katharine Cornell in The Barretts of Wimpole Street encouraged at least two other playwrights to turn their hands to theatrical biographies of 19th Century lady authors . A year ago there was talk of producing in the U. S. Clemence Dane 's Wild Decembers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This possibility becomes more remote now that Playwright Totheroh ( Distant Drums ) has gotten his own story of the three weird sisters of Haworth on the boards . There would be no use selecting the same family twice to demonstrate the well-proven thesis that the library , not the theatre , is the proper setting for biographical research .
