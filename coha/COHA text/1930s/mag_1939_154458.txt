Aside from the bleeding , dying and bereavement , one result of war is that while it impoverishes most people , some people make money out of it and a few make a lot of money . Last week no less than 50 U. S. Senators , enough to pass any bill , revived the idea of " taxing the profits out of war . " <P> The historically-dubious idea that wars are started for profit has long obsessed a group of Senators including Washington 's Homer Bone , North Dakota 's Gerald P. ( " Neutrality " ) Nye , Missouri 's Bennett Clark , Michigan 's Arthur Vandenberg . " To keep democracy alive , and for other purposes , " these gentlemen and 46 cosigners last week outdid themselves by sponsoring a war-tax measure written by little , pinch-faced Senator Bone . <P> Mr. Bone apparently failed to take into account that many States do not allow taxpayers to deduct Federal taxes in figuring their State income tax . Bone , Nye &; Co. proposed such wartime tax rates that many top-bracket taxpayers would find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not exceeding it , as newspapers reported last week ) . In New York , for example ( which has a State tax graduated up to 7% plus a 1% emergency tax ) , a $500,000-a-year man in a war year would have to pay Federal and State income taxes totaling $486,677 . On $1,000,000 , taxes would be $982,077 . <P> Homer Bone figured that such absurdities could be eliminated , would affect few people anyhow . For 1937 , only 48 taxpayers reported net incomes of between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000 ; only one of above $5,000,000 . But Bone &; Associates proposed to lower the personal exemption for single persons from $1,000 to $500 , for married persons from $2,500 to $1,000 , reduce allowances for dependents from $400 to $100 , up the basic tax from 4% to 6% . Proposed takings from sample taxable net incomes ( before State taxes ) : $60 from $1,000 , $860 from $6,000 , $11,080 from $20,000 , $90,280 from $100,000 , $9,891,280 from $10,000,000 . Corporations would have to turn over to the U. S. all net income in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However effective they might be in scaring the U. S. people into peace at any price , such levies would take away incentive for U. S. businessmen to help win a war . One of the 50 signers ( Iowa 's Guy Mark Gillette ) said he expected nobody to take a confiscatory proposal seriously . And of the 50 , only ten professed to have read the bill in full before they signed .
