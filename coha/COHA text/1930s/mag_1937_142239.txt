Saint Lydwina of Holland , when a sickly virgin of 15 , was persuaded in the winter of 1395 to rise from her sickbed and go skating upon the ice . No sooner had she ventured out on her runners than a rude young woman crashed into her , knocked her flat and broke her rib . " With unimaginable wailing of virgins , " St. Lydwina was carried back to bed where she remained for the next 38 years in constant agony , relieved only by angelic visions . <P> Last week a woodcut of St. Lydwina on ice , probably the earliest skating print in existence , was a feature of an exhibition of sporting prints and paintings at Manhattan 's Metropolitan Museum . If the Museum staff was only vaguely familiar with sporting art , this was not to its credit . Besides the skating woodcut , there were assembled a Rembrandt etching of a tired golfer , another skating scene by Rowlandson , etchings by Goya , five fine bronzes by Degas , a Hogarth cockfight , lithographs by George Wesley Bellows . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hounds and hunting . More than half were British , all were of a quality far superior to typical " sporting " art . <P> To avoid unnecessary rivalries , the Metropolitan 's exhibition contained the work of no living artist , which led to one curious result : in all these pictures of a form of art which holds accuracy and fidelity to nature a chief essential , there was only one picture of a horse really galloping . <P> Until the invention of photography , the shrewdest observer of horses in motion was a self-taught British sporting painter named George Stubbs . For eight years he studied the anatomy of the horse , dissecting carcasses , hanging articulated skeletons from the ceiling to move the legs with ropes . His Anatomy of the Horse , published in 1766 , is a landmark in veterinary medicine as well as in art . But in his pictures , many of which were in last week 's show , his hunters still galloped in the traditional hobbyhorse attitude , with all four feet fully extended . <P> This inaccuracy in equestrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of California , a famed horse breeder , bet two cronies $25,000 that there is a moment in each stride when a galloping horse has all four feet off the ground at once . It took him nine years and cost him $40,000 to win the bet . He hired a photographer , erratic , long-bearded Eadweard Muybridge , to take pictures of horses in motion at his Palo Alto stud farm . The first experiments were all failures . There followed an interlude while Photographer Muybridge was tried and acquitted under unwritten law for the murder of his wife 's lover . Meanwhile Governor Stanford became impatient , hired a young engineer named John D. Isaacs who finally arranged a battery of cameras along a track , wired their shutters electrically so that they could be opened and closed in succession as a running horse went by . Using this device , by 1881 Muybridge had succeeded in making an accurate series of pictures of Occident , Governor Stanford 's favorite horse , not only with four feet in the air at the gallop , but also in the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fence .
