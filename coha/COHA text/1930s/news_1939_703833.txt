txt The fate of James J. Hines , old-style Democratic leader , whose power in Tammany Hall has been great enough to make and break chieftains , today was in the hands of the blue ribbon jury impanelled in General Sessions Court since mid-January for his retrial on charges of affording political protection to the $20,000,000 " Dutch " Schultz policy racket . The curtain was run down on summations yesterday when Thomas E. Dewey , New York County District Attorney , whose prosecution of the Hines case climaxes a record in racket-busting that has brought him national distinction , delivered to the 12 ' ' good men and true " and two alternates in the jury bgx an arraignment of the politician that found every talesman leaning forward in rapt attention for the closing words of the'State 's summing up . Contrast In Attorneys From beginning to end , the young prosecutor 's day-long presentation of argument differed in every detail from the flamboyant showmanship which had characterized that of the day before of Lloyd Paul Stryker , defense counsel , whose 30-year grounding in criminal court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no studied effect on Mr. Dell'ey 's part , however , but as distinctively his approach as Mr. Stryker 's had been  --  a new school in pleading , as distinct from the old , as is Tammany brand of politics from the new progressive-ieform order now prevailing in New York City affairs and of which Mr. Dewey is a major product . In contrast to the Stryker method of bringing in nearly every point of the patriotic compass to declaim his client 's right to liberty , Mr. Dewey 's whole concern was with the book of the case . He had a story of crime in politics to unfold , and that is what he did , permitting himself no oratorical digressions from a record , which in itself had all the elements of a " best-seller " detective tale . The alliance between crime and politics must be smashed if the City is to be free , he pleaded , branding defense counsel 's charge that the . lase was a " frame-up " by two crooks , n Tombs Prison as a " terrific phony " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 ' " nonaccomplice " witaesses for the prosecution who corporated for the State the story of the alleged conspiracy . These innuded two former high officers of he Police Department , the Mayor of Mount Vernon , N. Y. ; John F. Curry , me-time Tammany chieftain ; Max Steuer , nationally known lawyer ; gr . Hines ' bookmaker , and Mrs. Arhur widow of the slain " Dutch " Schultz , whose policy ring was the " big-time " operation he politician is charged with shieldng . The review was exhaustive , but effect was cumtllative on the Jury , for it was listening to a building up of the whole , bit by bit , a link lime and a link there , that fastened all in together to accord with the District Attorney 's definition that " each witness is a bridge in the structure which , when completed , is a perfect whole . " " Ninety per cent of the people 's case is established like a rock by witnesses who were not even cross-examined , whole testimony was not even contradicted , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevail at the last , and the faces of the jurymen were as intent and solemn as his own as they sat forwaid to hear his words , " Here is a case which by every single fact which can be found is incontrovertibly true , " he said in tones as gravely quiet as defense counsel 's had been stridently emotional in conclusion . " Every statement by the witnesses weaves like this ( moving his hands together ) . It is the irrevocable march of truth . " Sentence in this case on the defendant is secondary . The court can suspend sentence , give one day , one year . whatever he pleases . It is none of my business and none of youis . People Freed " The important thing is that you declare to the people of New York , the police of New York , that they are free : that they wo n't any longer be betrayed by a corrupt alliance between crime and politics ; that that alliance is going to be smashed by this jury and branded as something we wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of system we have in this country and we do n't want it polluted by a betrayer and the protection of gangsters of police officers . ? " Here is the very thing which makes organized crime possible . There could n't be ? organized crime for five minutes unless the paralyzing hand of a crooked politician were available to break an honest ' cop , ' or to tell a magistrate what to do , or to use gangster money to elect a public prosecutor who is under his control . " I think we want to see that the men who are ultimately responsible for these things are punished for their sins ; that notice is served on the world that that sha n't , happen again ; that for these things we know there is a certain retribution visited by the community , which is you . " We are helpless , gentlemen , unless that is visited . I know you will do your duty . I know you will not say go back , prosecute the players and collectors , prosecute the burglar who gets caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner , but do n't get the man who sent him to steal ; prosecute the cheap and the petty , and perpetuate and turn loose those who made it possible ' " I know you will do your duty as citizens of New York .
