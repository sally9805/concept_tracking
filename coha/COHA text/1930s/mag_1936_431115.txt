NEXT to the public highways our homes are the most dangerous places in this country . Each year the records of fatal accidents offer tragic proof of this . The figures are appalling . During the last few years the yearly toll has been close to 35,000 , while at least four times this number of people have been permanently disabled each year because of home accidents , and millions have been injured more or less seriously . In fact , the home is far in the lead as the scene of accidents , yet we hear much less of these than we do of automobile accidents . Of course , we should remember that most people spend at least a third of their time at home , but only an hour or two a day on the streets and other highways . Therefore they axe exposed to domestic accidents many more hours each week . However , we should re- member , too , that nearly all these home accidents could have been prevented . Most of them were caused by the same old human failings ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to take risks . Accident prevention in our homes usually needs only a little extra care , a little added knowledge of unsafe conditions , then checking up on these throughout the house and promptly correcting them . We need not be fearful of accidents at home . We should be aware of the causes and apply the remedies ? usually simple . Last December , at the suggestion of President Roosevelt , Secretary of Commerce Daniel C. Roper called a conference in Washington to work out plans for making accident prevention more effective . This conference group  | planned to function as a clearing house in a nationwide safety drive by coopcrating with organizations crcady working in the interests of safety . Several committees were formed , each representing major aspects of the safety problem as a whole . As a member of the Committee on Home Safety , I am calling on the women to lead the way . Let us begin in our own homes today ? not tomorrow . And let us miss no opportunity to carry the message of safety to other homes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ? the increasing protection of workers by means of safer working conditions and practices , and by periodic inspections for the purpose of maintaining these day in and day our . But a man 's house is his castle ; we can not invade it with regulations or laws . We can not subject private homes to periodic inspection as we do our industrial establishments . We can ,  | however , volunteer to make period . inspections of the conditions in oz. - own homes , and encourage others t do the same . Falls lead as the cause of accidents i : . the home . Have you ever slipped on a scatter rug laid on a polished floor ' If so , you were lucky if you escaped without a serious fall . A friend of mine slipped on a scatter rug in his own living room , fell , and fractured his leg . That was three months ago , and he is just now learning to walk again . If that rug had been anchored to the floor by putting under it a non-skid material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly tried out a number of these rug anchors at the Institute and have found them effective . Of course we should avoid placing small scatter rugs just at the head or the foot of the stairs , as rug anchors may not prove adequate for the extra demand made upon them . Check u ? now on your own scatter rugs . Waxed floors are made slippery not by too much polishing but by using too much wax and too little polishing . Apply wax sparingly and evenly and polish it to a hard finish . A friend of mine was hurrying downstairs a few months ago , holding something in both hands . Her toe caught in a small hole in the carpet , and she  | was thrown headlong downstairs , hitting her head , fracturing her right arm , and seriously injuring her shoulder joint . She had looked at that hole several times and had planned to have it repaired ? tomorrow . The neglect of minor repairs about the house too often results in major accidents . If my friend had had one free hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been avoided . All stairs not only should have rails , but should be free from any obstacles , and should be well lighted by merely turning a switch at the stair head or foot . And for the protection of toddlers , there should be a gate at the head of the stairs . On page 85 Mr. Wyrtzen has stressed the importance of good lighting and of having switches so placed as to light a path ahead of us , eliminating groping for a switch in the dark . Good lighting makes our homes safer not only for our eyes , but for our limbs . Night lights use very little current and therefore cost little , but if they are suitably placed , they may save us from serious falls . Have you ever mounted the first thing at hand in reaching a high shelf ? a rocking chair , a doubtful-looking box , or a step stool that offered an insecure footing ? And that decrepit stepladder ? it may fail you some day . Have you slipped in getting out of the bathtub because there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious falls . You should have in your kitchen a well-made , firm step stool , with a good broad base to prevent its tipping . Stepladders should be sturdy , and you should always be sure that the brace is securely locked before you use it . Are you guilty of using gasoline or naphtha for dry cleaning , or taking out spots , or for cleaning the floors ? I say guilty , for if you use gasoline or naphtha for this work , you are inviting death and destruction . Gasoline is highly volatile , and the vapor , when mixed with air , is highly explosive in the vicinity of even a small flame . Even the spark sometimes given off when rubbing the garment lightly may cause a devastating explosion . The daily papers too often carry harrowing stories of deaths by fire and explosion , as a result of using gasoline in the home . Yet many women still take tragically serious risks in using it ; and frequently not only they themselves but others and their property are seriously injured . Noninflammable solvents are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but work in a well-ventilated room , and do not attempt dry cleaning at home . It is difficult to do this work satisfactorily and it is not altogether safe either , for these solvents are also highly volatile , and their fumes are toxic when breathed in any quantity . The comparatively large quantities of the solvent necessary in dry cleaning give off fumes in a volume that  | might well prove hazardous , so stay on the safe side and send your work to a good dry cleaner . Tidiness about the house is an important safety measure . Trash should not be allowed to collect ; and if you burn it outdoors , use a good trash burner to keep the fire well enclosed . The best and the safest place for cigarette and cigar stubs is in an incombustible ash tray . Oily rags may start a serious fire . Dispose of them safely . Hot ashes should be stored in a metal container . Although modern equipment for housekeeping has introduced the possibility of new hazards , reliable equipment , if properly used , should make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of the dangers involved in using kerosene lamps , the old wood stoves with their stovepipe and chimney fires ; and think of the clouds of dust that rose when the carpets were swept ? to say nothing of the drudgery of it all . On page 191 Mr. Wyrtzen has emphasized the necessity of using fuses properly , of not overloading both the outlets and the house circuits , of not connecting appliances to lamp sockets , and of keeping the wiring and good connecting cords in repair . There is too much makeshift wiring in our homes ? wires strung around the baseboards and over and under rugs . This invites serious fires as well as serious falls . In testing equipment at Good Housekeeping Institute , we give a great deal of attention to its safety aspects . Our standards insure good , safe construction ; and our Seal of Approval carries a message of safety as well as of efficiency , if the approved device is properly used and cared for and kept in good repair . In this nationwide safety drive the various organizations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel sure , be glad to cooperate with you in spreading the gospel of safety in your community ? such organizations as the National Safety Council , the American Red Cross , and the American Federation of Women 's Clubs . All have been doing outstanding work in the field of safety .  |
