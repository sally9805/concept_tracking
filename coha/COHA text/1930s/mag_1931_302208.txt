Embargo , like Tariff , is a game at which any number of nations can play . In Washington , Chairman Legge of the Federal Farm Board is calling for " a temporary embargo on wheat imports " ( TIME , Jan. 5 ) . Last week Argentina got into the game . Her new Provisional Government , headed by swart , hard-eyed , big-mustachioed General Uriburu , suddenly declared an absolute embargo on " Paraguay tea . " <P> For little Paraguay the blow was staggering . She has exported her " tea " ( yerba mate ) almost exclusively to Argentina . Other nations do not like it . Last year a campaign to launch Paraguay tea in New York as " a new drink with a.new kick " petered out . The brew is not alcoholic . Aghast last week , Paraguayan statesmen realized that whereas Paraguay has been accustomed to drink two-thirds of her tea she may now have to drink it all . <P> Hard-boiled Argentine reason for the embargo : an " infant industry " producing Paraguay tea in Argentina has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 50.000 Argentine laborers . Amid present " depressed conditions " the native and foreign yerba mate industries can not both flourish . It seems best to knife the adult neighbor to save one 's own child . <P> So may the U. S. attempt to knife Canada in her wheat pit , so may Canada knife back at the U. S. with an embargo on manufactured products . Already Australia has clapped embargoes on a list of nearly 100 imports ( TIME , July 21 ) .
