Out of the mouths of babes , parents are sometimes horrified to see emitted sturdy pink bubbles which burst with a snapping sound . A child who is expert with bubble gum can blow a globe almost as big as his head . Satisfaction is also to be derived from gulping back bubbles of moderate size , making them pop inside the mouth . As millions of U. S. moppets return to school this month these practices are going to be more prevalent , because September is a peak month for sales of " Blony " bubble gum . <P> Blony is not the only nor the original bubble gum , but for eight years it has been the most popular , and comprises at least 60% of that delicacy now sold in the U. S. It is concocted in Philadelphia by Gum , Inc. , which occupies five floors and the basement of a building on Woodland Avenue . The Blony process and Gum , Inc. , are both creations of one of Philadelphia 's lustiest characters , burly , brown-eyed Jacob Warren Bowman , whose business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio , raised on a New Mexico ranch , he was " married , divorced and bankrupt " before he was 21 . After going broke he settled down to work for the Overland used-car agency in Los Angeles until one day he heard that a steam laundry was badly needed in Tampico , Mexico , to wash oil workers ' dirty shirts . <P> By the time Bowman got to Tampico a local group had already started a steam laundry , so he bought a little motor boat to pull barges . When this enterprise failed , he and another young American chugged off to Veracruz , conceived the idea of revolutionizing the mahogany trade by floating mahogany logs down the rivers to the Gulf . The two adventurers struggled for several days getting a mahogany log out of the forest into a small stream , where , since mahogany is heavier than water , it immediately sank . <P> Back in the U. S. the alert Bowman went into the coffee-roasting business , impulsively sold out when it occurred to him that candy lozenges like Life Savers would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work out his idea at the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research in Pittsburgh , he was surprised to learn that it had been tried before , was hopeless . But Bowman was getting nearer to his destined specialty . On his way to Detroit to take a job in an automobile plant , he met a chewing-gum salesman who was working the ' ' butcher knife deal . " Within a year J. Warren Bowman himself was a topnotch gum salesman , exponent of the " Indian blanket deal " ( one blanket with every 24 boxes ) and part owner of a plant in Lansing , Mich. , which turned out a 1 gum called " Ju-Ce-Kiss . " In 1927 he started his own plant in Philadelphia , in 1929 produced Blony . <P> Blony 's chief claim to commercial prestige is that it is bigger than any other piece of bubble gum offered for a penny . Base of all bubble gums is a synthetic rubber product combined with hydrogenized vegetable oils and synthetic resins . " Blony , " which is flavored with what Bubbleman Bowman calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Three Big BITES for a penny , " has made Gum , Inc. the biggest firm in the U. S. catering exclusively to the penny gum trade .
