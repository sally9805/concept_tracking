Last week Montgomery Ward &; Co. reported March sales at the highest level of any month since 1930 and 62.6% above March 1933 . Ward sales were not news , for almost every report of retail volume for the Easter season had revealed thumping big gains . But with accountants still footing figures for Industry 's first quarter , no one knows precisely how much the swift advance has meant in profits . What was news in the Ward statement was President Sewell Lee Avery 's estimated earnings of $1,000,000 for February and March . In the same two months of last year Ward lost $1,900,000 . In all the months of last year it earned only $2,000,000.
