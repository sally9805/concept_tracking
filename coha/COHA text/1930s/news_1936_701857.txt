txt In one of the liveliest annual meetings Yield by stockholders of Montgomery , Ward &; Co .. Sewell Avery , chairman of the board , said in effect that the management is just as desirous as stockholders of increasing dividends as soon as it feels it can properly do so But many things remain to be done , he explained , to produce maximum Operacang efficiency . The session was unusual in the number of questions asked by a large number of stockholders , the scope of subjects discussed , the readiness with which queries of all kinds were answered , and the apparent eagerness of stockholders to participate in every phase of the discussion , on one side or the other . " This Miserable Little Dividend " However , throughout the meeting discussion repeatedly came back to the one question which seemed of paramount interest to most stockholders : What will be Ward 's dividend policy ' " You have received this miserable little 20 cents a share dividend , " said Mr. Avery ti answer to one stockholder 's question " Maybe it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silas H. Strawn , chairman of the executive committee , entered the discussion . He said that if there is any chance of paying a larger dividend , we will be glad to . But the bulk of the management 's talking was naturally done by Mr. Avery . who remarked that about 100 stockholders bad written notations on their proxies , commenting on a number of subjects . Six Classifications of Questions These , he asserted , fell into six classifications in the following order of importance : ( 1 ) dividend was considered too small , ( 2 ) comments upon the tax situation : ( 3 ) salaries are too large ; ( 4 ) too much is spent in expanding physical properties ; ( 2 ) stock purchase option granted Mn Avery ; 161 occasional objection to what was assumed to be his political activities . More Capital Needed " We are on the verge of needing more capital in the business , " said Mr. Avery " At the moment we do not . We have brought our mail order structure back to modern efficiency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' we could operate those we have profitably . " I should say from the proposed tax bill that at least half our earnings must be declared in dividends or a heavy penalty inflicted . If we should declare 40% or 50% of our earnings in dividends we would have to make growth by selling additional stock or putting a bond issue on the company . " As to offering more stock Mr. Avery said that since the company has almost 4.600.000 common shares outstanding it would be best to build up from earnings to replace past losses without attenuating the stock too much . As for incurring indebtedness , he pointed out the low rates are on short term money . Earlier . in arguing for more dividends , a stockholder had suggested that if working capital is not sufficient commercial paper is 1% and bank loans a year . Financing Is Principal Problem Mr. Avery , explaining that one of the difficulties of the company is its financing , traced its depression difficulties with a retail store program on its hands under which , at one time , 74% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unused funds raised for establishing 1,500 stores saved the company from outright disaster . " In recovery , the business has grown so that formerly unused acres in all the mail order houses are crowded to the roof , and additional building has been necessary . The trend of the growth still continues . It must be remembered . however , that in extreme conditions mail order institutions suffer unusually , because of the nature of catalog business , and it is particularly advisable not to be in debt in this business , but to bold a sound credit position , so that in stresses you can command temporary amounts you may need to carry it . " Mail order operations are being conducted better and more cheaply than heretofore , and 54 stores have been completely relocated . Through that kind of development , on which was spent a large part of surplus funds carried through the depression , the company has been able to change its mail order and retail statement into the black . " To illustrate the attitude on dividends in some quarters . Mr. Avery said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a share in the past two years . while stockholders got 20 cents a share . Who got the balance ? , the stockholder asked . Mr. Avery said that a strong corporate position should be reflected in the value of the stock even though it does not provide income . Another stockholder said . " Stockholders generally feel that they have a right to 50% of earnings , unless the outlook is pessimistic , and if there is ample working capital " " Interesting Idea Still another said that , while naturally those disgruntled about dividends or Mr. Avery 's compensation would be most heard from , be knew several stockholders who were enthusiastic about what he had done , " The plowing back of profits , " he said " Is the soundest kind of buainesa and all that Is needed is a little patience and we will be money ahead . Also , if we hired Mr. Avery or a man of his ability at $500,000 a year we would be money ahead . " very interesting idea , " nxmarked Mr Avery . Two elderly stockholders asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would not get them in their lifetime . One , a woman , said , " This concern has money for everything except the stockholders " . In reply , Mr. Avery said . " Corporations are soulless only legally . They are men and women . cooperating presumably for the common good . The intricacies and difficulties of handling these larger business groups are very great We are fearful that in the search for the answer that will satisfy every one in this country we are going into experiments and forgetting the system that has made possible our country 's marvelous growth . " Another stockholder said that as labor must have its hire . so should the stockholder . Mr. Avery said , " The aun is to bring about that We have paid our debt , put our buildings in shape . and paid accumulated preferred dividends . We are going fairly well  --  not too well ? ahead . We are tusking money at an increasing rate . IN:ow we are quarreling about the size of the common dividend . Our economies can be greater and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , common horse sense , at work with great earnestness and enthusiasm , sometimes amid great stress , " he declared . Question of Expansion The same elderly man who spoke before said . " If the surplus is being constantly used in the expansion of the business , then the stockholder does not get a good share of it When a man gets along in his seventies he begins to wonder if he is going to live long enough to get a part of it " . Mr. Avery answered that there was no choice . " If stockholders ' funds had not been used to revitalize mail order houses and stores you would not have been at this meeting " , he said . " We were going down and out We are in a competitive business . The battle is severe.1 You must have capital equipment . " Another stockholder asked whether a corporation could not expand too far , in view of the Government 's adverse attitude toward further expansion of great corporations and driving the small man out of business . Another asserted there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best interests of the stockholder . Ward Policy on Salaries As to his 3100,000 annual salary and option for 100,000 shares of common stock , Mr. Avery said that while most people would say that no one is worth more than $5,000 a year , the matter of paying leaders in any field becomes an economic , negotiable affair . " Only three large compsnies do most of the automobile business , but 800 automobile concerns died in the competitive struggle . Growth seems to indicate accomplishment from the standpoint of the buyer . Surely you do noj , object to as much growth as a consumer demands ? " Mr. Avery explained that Ward 's plait is to give employes a participation in their own excellent performance . " Competitors are constantly raiding the company for able people and that situation has to be met " As to his option , he declared that he is still considerably in debt for that stock and there is the question of how to get it out in view of the taxes that face him . As to his salary , an expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take $70,000 of his $100,000 salary and in the event of his death with consequent inheritance tax only 412,700 of the $100,000 would go to his family . Still another shareholder wanted to know if it would not be better to give the money to the stockholders instead of the Government . Mr. Avery remarked that corporations are bigger than the individuals trying to run them . " You 've got to get the people to run this trained technicians doing nothing else but training and educating personnel . You can not get good men except at the market price When I came here thousands of men had beer cut down in pay until they were starving . " All of our money is at work in the business . We have no weak division that we can shut up . They are all profitable . Tim things are han pening as an evidence of your on-coming div ? dends , " he concluded . George M. Vaught , Ward 's treasurer , was elected a director .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
