In New York , where there are five race tracks , betting on horse races has been illegal since 1908 , but bookmakers for the past five years have been permitted to operate at the tracks through a loophole in the law . Although most New York racing fans consider pari-mutuels* ( which have been legalized in 18 States ) a fairer system of betting , a small but powerful lobby in Albany has for five years influenced legislators against replacing book betting with pari-mutuel machines . <P> A year ago New York 's law makers , enviously noting that California collects some $2,000,000 a year from the 4% tax on the pari-mutuel handle at its race tracks , finally turned a deaf ear to lobbyists , passed ( 33-To-14 in the Senate , 110-to-36 in the Assembly ) a resolution for a constitutional amendment to legalize pari-mutuel betting . Under New York law , however , it had to be passed by two successive Legislatures before it could be submitted to the voters for referendum . <P> Last week , while 120 of New York 's bookies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be their last Belmont Park meeting , the measure met its crucial test , passed the State Senate a second time-in spite of an alleged $100,000 greasing fund put up by bookmakers . Now expected to be passed by the Assembly and approved at the polls next November , pari-mutuels may appear at New York tracks next spring , and an extra $5,000,000 to $10,000,000 revenue is counted on for the State . <P> For those racing fans who prefer to bet against bookmakers ( because their odds are stable ) , non-partisan observers last week suggested permitting both bookmakers and pari-mutuels to operate at New York tracks , a common practice in England and Australia . New York merchants , who disapprove of mutuels ( because of their popularity with the masses ) , had the condolences of the merchants of Miami , Los Angeles , Boston , Baltimore . <P> <P> * Machine betting through a general pool in which the odds are determined by the amount bet on each horse-after 3% to 10% has been deducted for the owners of the track and 3 % to 4% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
