U. S. education attempts to cultivate children 's minds and bodies , lets their emotions grow like weeds or wildflowers . The results of this neglect , think mental hygienists , appear in the appallingly high rates of U. S. divorce , crime and insanity , in a national jitteriness . Last week the American Council on Education published a report* proposing that the schools pay as much attention to children 's emotions as to the three Rs . <P> The committee that produced the report spent four years exploring the relation of emotion to learning . It had a grant from the Josiah Macy Jr . Foundation . Its chairman is husky , placid Professor Daniel Alfred Prescott , 40 , of Rutgers University . A onetime Harvard teacher , Dr. Prescott is widely respected by educators for his tremendous research in sociology and psychology , is also an indefatigable stamp collector . <P> Dr. Prescott and his colleagues found human emotions a largely unmapped wilderness , its few known contours indicating that feeling 's springs feed learning 's river . Thus , whether an individual learns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive for learning it . One significant test showed that people learn pleasant words most efficiently , unpleasant ones less easily and words about which they are indifferent least efficiently . <P> Chief concern of Dr. Prescott was what can be done about training the emotions so that children will become well-balanced adults instead of arrested adolescents . The emotional impulses and cravings with which a child is born - love , fear , the need for affection and for the sense of belonging to a group - are bedeviled by many witches . Besides the timeless family jealousies and bickerings that make a child feel insecure , the accelerating tempo of modern life , the danger and excitement that fill even the comic strips , the rootlessness of city dwellers and competition in all things make " anxiety . . . the most prominent mental characteristic " of western civilization . Dr. Prescott found that by &; large even the schools create tensions in children , by regimentation , by making them read before they are ready to learn to read , by giving them too many doses of failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's emotions can be trained . The big problem is : in what direction ? The committee could not tell what emotional maturity is . Emotional behavior that eliminates tensions in the individual may not please society . " Yet society is not consistent within itself . . . . Socially , it is regarded as a mark of maturity in the United States to hate communism , while in much of Russia the affectively mature hate capitalism . " Emotionally mature behavior , concluded Dr. Prescott , must be a compromise between physiological , social and ethical demands . <P> The committee recommended that the schools provide much more art , music and other esthetic outlets , that they offer children a fair balance between failure and success . Greatest need , however , is unworried , better-balanced teachers , preferably married .
