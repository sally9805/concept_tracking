Last week the most exhaustive aeronautical survey ever undertaken by the Federal Government opened in Washington as the Federal Aviation Commission , headed by Atlanta 's small , roly-poly Clark Howell , began public hearings . An outgrowth of the airmail contract cancellations , the Howell Committee was a belated attempt by President Roosevelt to right a wrong and , at the same time , determine a national aviation policy . Chairman Howell had spent six weeks investigating , at Government expense , the condition of aviation in Europe , while his four fellow committee members had flown some 1000 miles on an inspection tour of airways and airports in the U. S. and Central America . <P> Witnesses at the first week 's hearings of the Howell Committee included : <P> Daniel Calhoun Roper , Secretary of Commerce , who declared the U. S. should be " aeroized " just as it was " motorized . " For a means of " aeroizing " the country he suggested that the Howell Committee confer with " some of the outstanding leaders in the motor industry . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics , who foretold development within four or five years of a 400-m.p.h. military plane capable of flying from Washington to New York in half an hour . <P> James Aloysius Farley , Postmaster General , who predicted that the U. S. airmail system would become self-supporting within three or four years . Until that time , said Mr. Farley , in nearly the exact words of onetime Postmaster General Walter Folger Brown , it would be the Post Office Department 's policy to continue financial assistance to mail-carrying transport lines . As to new airlines , the Department 's position was that it was economically unsound to finance them in competition " with the lines we are trying to build up . " <P> Eugene Luther Vidal , Director of the Bureau of Air Commerce , who urged a five-year expansion program for U. S. airlines to foreign countries , under Government subsidy ; also a passenger subsidy to domestic airlines as an incentive to further passenger traffic . <P> Ewing Y. Mitchell , Assistant Secretary of Commerce , who proposed that the Federal Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round-the-world passenger service .
