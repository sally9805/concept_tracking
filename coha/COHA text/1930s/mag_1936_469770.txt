( This narrative is true . I have told it not in the precise words in which the secret agent told it to me , but in words which convey the gist and spirit of his life story . A few unessential details have been altered , others suppressed , for obvious reasons . The whole effort has been to preserve in its stark reality the human elements involved in the melodramatic experiences of a trusted secret service agent , working for thirty years at his dangerous undercover craft . 1-1 . W.L. ) Fliedmore than a quarter of a century I 11 lied and stole and deceived and bribed and killed men suddenly and ruthlessly ? all in doing my appointed everyday job . Not once did my conscience reproach me . Rather did I feel that I have " deserved well of the country " I served . But I realize now that I have been necessarily a solitary soul . A secret agent must live without friends , without love , without excitements , without even enthusiasms . Only when he is completely divested of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his task requires . Almost from my birth I was sternly trained in the cheerless art of living alone . I was predestined to be a soldier , like my father and all my forebears . Ever since the First Crusade that tradition had been unquestionably dominant in our family : a first son was born , not into the world , but into the Army . My father was an awe-inspiring illustration of how a man may harden into an egocentric tyrant over all the little group of human beings he can dominate . That was my father , a brilliant mathematician , a most capable brain , a completely logical mind . He brooked no contradiction , exacting blind , slavish obedience . But while the colonels and majors and captains of his staff feared within and stammered without each time they came before " General Bear , " his family was in far worse case . No checks stood between the autocrat and the slaves of his household . Law , ancient tradition , and accepted custom gave him unrestrained dominance there . As a sub-lieutenant , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousin Peter and several other fellows . It was my first escape from home and I speedily became drunk with the novel excitement after my restricted existence . I quickly lost not only the thousand dollars I had saved up during several years for some such epoch-making occasion ? but two thousand more which I did not have . After the first overwhelming panic I found Peter had been lucky . Borrowing from him the sum necessary to clear my debt of honor , I paid the Casino . Then I wrote my father , telling precisely what had happened . His reply was completely in char-acter : " I am sending you a draft for the two thousand dollars you have thrown away . You will immediately pay this over to your cousin , taking his receipt and forwarding this promptly to me . The slightest reflection will show you that you have merely transferred your creditor : you now owe this two thousand to me instead of to Peter . It is a large amount of money , especially for a boy of eighteen who has nothing except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is but one possible way in which you can discharge this debt within the next ten years ; and , recklessly dishonorable as you have shown yourself in this disgraceful episode , no son of mine could possibly hesitate under such circumstances to redeem this small remnant of honor . " You will write me at once your solemn , sworn obligation never again to touch cards or bet on games of chance as long as you live . " For I have decided that , with this safeguard of my name for the future , I shall cancel your debt to me of this two thousand dollars . " In my abasement it seemed a small price to pay for a clean slate . I swore as ordered . And , after keeping that oath for thirty-five years , I no longer have any desire for the relaxation of even the most innocent card games . I realize now that I have never had an intimate friend , never really loved any woman . That capacity too was a part of me which was excised , first in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craftsmen who shaped me for my profession . Even when I graduated from the military college and went , as second lieutenant , to join a Colonial regiment , my father fought hard and cunningly against letting me escape . He actually wrote my colonel , suggesting that he keep an extra strict watch over me . " He is a boy who will disgrace his regiment , his family , and himself unless you drive him always with a curb bit and the tightest of reins ? as I have done all his life , " declared this parental missive . The Colonel happened to be a human being . He sent for me , read me the whole thing . " What in the world does this mean , Lieutenant ? " I told him . " Ah , I see . One of that old race which confuses themselves with God . Listen . While you are with me I wish you to live a normal life . Nothing more . Nothing less . It will not be gay ; but after twenty years of ? that -- it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It will be heaven after the life I have had to live , sir . " " Very good . Remember . Dismissed . " All this home repression , driving my natural instincts back within , to consider and feed upon themselves ; all the daily training in concealing everything I really felt , was a chance product of being sired by a martinet . Yet it did something irrevocable to me : always would my secret life be mine alone . The outer layer of " me " could and did take part in all sorts of small social activities ? and never betray that there was anything different underneath . I was secret long before I was a secret agent . And since there is always a place where an unusual human quality can be put to work in the great human machine , presently this complex organism stretched out a cunning hand , laid hold of me as a potential cog in its intricate mechanism , and deliberately set about perfecting the involuntary training and shaping of my nature first begun by my father . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , years . In peace times that routine military existence is like an endless uneventful ocean voyage . A man does not even have any ultimate decisions to make , responsibilities to assume and worry over : all initiative , all responsibility is for those higher up . A subaltern officer must not think ; he obeys orders . The lucky fact that my colonel had been through the mill so many years yet remained human saved me from the worst effects of the tyranny my father had attempted to continue from his little official dictatorship a thousand miles away ; he did succeed , however , by the solemn oath he had exacted in depriving me of one of an idle man 's chief resourceseven the most harmless forms of cardplaying without any stakes . Now cards and chess and dominoes and such " time-wasting " little diversions are life-savers to a man engaged in a mechanical routine , in a profession to which he was predestined by lack of any other taste and by the example of thirty generations of ancestors ? but in which advancement during peace times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men require only a charming woman in the offing to secure all the excitement they need . There were charming women who appeared in my little orbit from time to time . More than once , in a momentary blaze of sentiment , I fancied such a fascinating creature was the feminine other self whom every man dreams of finding ; but in no case did the illusion last long enough even to land me in that bittersweet turmoil which is the supreme joy and torment of hot questing youth . The ancient anodyne of drunkenness had no appeal for me . I considered a real dinner impossible without wine , but a little satisfied me . And some native temperate quality made it impossible for me to seek release in the relaxing potencies of alcohol . It seemed messy and stupid . I had not even the recourse of an intimate friend : that same fixed glance inward , that self-conscious uncertainty with other unknown personalities , prevented my making any real friends . Little was left except my work , my ambition to rise in my profession , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a healthy , vigorous young man of thirty . Yet that is what I lived on for ten years . It was not a gay life . And , as any psychologist could have told me , these stupid social inhibitions increased all the time . Then one day , out of the blue , I was ordered to report to Q 2 . That was somewhat startling . For Q 2 was our Secret Service ? so secret that one in any other branch did n't talk about it . To be summoned theremight mean anything : if a man happened to have a bad conscience it might mean running away as far and fast as possible ? while knowing that would n't be fast enough . For the head of that Service had no superior except the Head of the Department ; he ranked as a major general , with peculiar responsibilities , privileges , and summary powers . Should swift private action be necessary " for the good of the State , " he did not report or consult ? he acted . And those people had their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to justify their classification by sharp deeds . A mart who let out secrets in unfriendly company , however innocently , came easily within that definition . Nothing of that sort troubled me . I had no women in my life to whom one must at times tell forbidden matters . The one wholehearted allegiance of my life was the Army , and the Government behind it which symbolized my native land . It would have been impossible for me to be indiscreet even had I known anything to be indiscreet about . Still it was with lively curiosity , and with something more nearly approaching excitement than I often experienced , that I set out for the designated quarters . The major before whom I found myself , in a retired little whitewashed cubicle , received me with the smiling intimacy of an old friend of the family . " You are comfortable in your new quarters ? And it is something to be a captain instead of a lieutenant , no ? " " Yes , sir , it is a step . " " And it stirs your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . " " You wish then so ardently to rise in your profession ? " " It is all I have , sir . " " How is that ? One has love , one gambles , one savors good wine , one has a family , and friends . " " The Army is all that to me , sir . I have nothing except the tradition of a thousand years to be a soldier . " " Then why ? ? " And to my amazed discomfiture he began at the very beginning , nearly ten years before , and recited , with all the proper emphasis , every single peccadillo , every least infraction of regulations , of which I had ever been guilty . It was like having the Recording Angel receive one hospitably , and suddenly pull forth your complete dossier and read inexorably through the list of things done which ought not to have been done . The tall man facing me seemed to know even the fugitive hot , impulsive , rebellious thoughts smothered without turning into acts which I myself had utterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daze . So this was the reason for my summons . What was going to happen ? The cumulative effect of these petty misdeeds piled on top of one another was overwhelming . It must be like that to stand in the dock and have some relentless prosecuting attorney charge you with one crime after another . Should I presently hear this calm emotionless voice announce that I was reduced to my former rank ? Or could it be that I should be dishonorably dismissed from the Service ? The Major 's next words quite dumfounded me . " We shall soon see if you have the makings of a Q 2 agent . You will be transferred immediately . Report to the place mentioned in your orders . " Remember always that now , in these dull times of peace , we may be only sixty in all , we who belong to Q 2 . But when war comes it is we who will have to handle the essential activities of thousands . " And remember always that the first law is silence . " Carelessness with us is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more fatal : we can look out for traitors and open enemies ; but a hundred wise men 's efforts may be destroyed by one loosetongued fool . " There is a hard but true saying in the Bible : ' For it must needs be that offences come ; but woe unto that man by whom the offence cometh . ' You may go . " 1 went out from there , a very thoughtful young officer . A week later I entered my new and secret life 's work . ' II Many a time I have smiled , even if somewhat wryly , at the romantic readers of spy fiction who tell me how thrilling and exciting my life must have been . There may be romance and adventure in the secret agent 's work , but he has no part in it . Those things are found only by those who already carry them within . And before a man is fit for our work he must , as the surgeons say , completely extirpate that very capacity . As proof , consider the course of training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherished reputation of infallibility . No individual ever gets credit for any specially brilliant coup . His immediate superior demands success , at the price of dismissal ; if that final disgrace of open discovery should befall , he knows that those who sent him to death must disown him completely . He is no longer a person , he is a secret Number , one of a group of Numbers which , when put together acquire a mystic power . Here is what happens to the digits before they can become integers of this dominating complete Figure . The aim of all the activities for which I was to be trained was , to obtain information . That was the Chief End of Man , as your Catechism puts it . Information about every " enemy 's " armaments , fortresses , military condition , new inventions , plans , experiments . And to our Service , as to any General Staff , all other nations in the world are potential enemies . To justify existence there must be plans all ready and filed away , complete , like those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last legging button ? for war with anybody . Of course generals ca n't make intelligent plans without being informed exactly as to what the enemy has , both in the way of attack and defense . That was where we came in . To secure a constant stream of up-to-the-minute " inside dope , " on which to base these constantly revised plans for all conceivable and inconceivable emergencies , a marvellous technic and a body of traditions had been developed over a couple of centuries . And we performed that job . There was nothing so hidden in any great country but that we presently revealed it to our masters in power . In military and naval matters we knew all about every other nation ? and , I must admit , they proved again and again they knew all about us . Once I was somewhat taken aback , on reaching this point , to have an irreverent outsider burst out laughing and demand : " Well , if you discover all their most closely guarded secrets before they can be used , and they find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemn precautions , and all the stagey hush-hush stuff , differ from the play of a gang of boys pretending to be Indians on the warpath . " 1 ca n't answer that ; it was not included in any of the school courses . Anyhow , mine was not a thinking part . It was not my province to understand the least fragment of Why . Doubtless the department heads would have a crushing retort to such levity : their god-given attributes were omniscience and infallibility , As for me , I obeyed orders . I soon learned there were half a dozen chief sections of the curriculum which was to turn out competent workers in this exacting profession of procuring In-formation : ( 1 ) Special and technical knowledge of many sorts . ( 2 ) Physical and mental equipment of the worker . ( 3 ) The working tools of the profession . ( 4 ) The science and art of securing information . ( 5 ) Arranging to get the information to Headquarters . ( 6 ) Offense and defense in emergencies . There was plenty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rigorous years of training in military college , and ten years ' actual army service . When I reported to the C. 0 . in a city not a hundred miles from my own native region , and learned that my first study was to be geography ? three months of intensive concentration on it ? it seemed somewhat as if time had actually turned backward , landing me in childhood 's classes once more . But I soon discovered this geography was different . A highly specialized form it proved to be ? military geography . I learned every detail of the strategic position and defensive qualities of every important city in Europe ? not to mention some in Asia , Africa , and the transatlantic world . The highways , railways , mountain passes , rivers , and other joints in that country 's natural armor took their place in this memorized , annotated gazetteer , as did the location of fortresses , army posts , artillery , small-arm and munition plants , chief factories , water supplies , centers of electricity and gas , ports ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , either as a lone scout , or with an invading army . No notes . A man who could n't write would hardly have felt the handicap in that branch of the Service : nothing must be put on paper lest in case of accident some private fact get out . Everything must be patiently memorized , held in the subconscious , ready for instant use , yet safe from the cleverest enemy . I learned the amazing things constant practice and rigorous necessity can do in developing memory . The textbooks used in this course had an ancestry dating back to the Thirty Years War , when France and Germany , Catholic and Protestant , concentrated central authority and a shifting group of heterogeneous States , showed the world what sub-human savageries man is capable of in the sacred name of Religion ; also they dragged all the rest of us Europeans , actively or passively , into that terrible vortex of blood and tears . These texts were revised up to the minute like a Wall Street broker 's market reports ; like all the other textbooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own specialties , in part from men whose very names were unknown outside the Service , but whose special knowledge was exhaustive , and whose enthusiasm for the cause was that of fanatical devotees . Naturally we used the splendid work of Bertillon on fingerprints , and some stuff on handwriting and physiognomy by great German scientists , as a basis for the expert manuals developed by our own technical writers , just as they embodied in their works any new ideas we developed . It was a bewildering new world of startling facts and ingenious classifications , complex in the extreme . Even the comparatively straightforward statistics of geography jostled one another into kaleidoscopic confusion . But I had nothing to distract my mind from my task , and I am capable of profound concentration . Impossible as such a result seemed at first , when I came to the exhaustive tests at the end of the quarter-year , I had a mental map of the civilized world as vivid and detailed as if Mars , God of War , looked down and beheld every past and present human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a question slid smoothly across the conscious stage of - my mind , displaying every least fact needed for the answer . In physical and mental fitness , and in all-round ability to do anything which might need doing , our instructors set a difficult enough standard . As a self-contained , independent power unit , ready to perform for himself any operation of everyday life , a man must of course drive a motor car or plane , run a launch , sail a boat , ride any horse , be an exceptional mountain climber , walker , skier , swimmer , diver . His muscleswere trained to instant explosive energy and to tirelessness ; he must run till finding second wind became an expected commonplace ; even gymnasts ' tricks , scaling walls , climbing ropes hand over hand , had to be included in the repertoire , since he could be quite sure of finding himself in situations where only the unexpected and extraordinary could bring him out again . Mental training went beyond the utmost which one could imagine called for in ordinary walks of life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ languages . Memory and observation were cultivated to their extreme capacity . Everything must be carried in the head to avoid tell-tale memoranda which might be lost or stolen . The parts of a face impossible to disguise must be studied so minutely that that face would never be forgotten . Thus we learned that the base of the nose is full of individuality and can not be altered ; nor can the space between the eyes ; nor the way a man uses his hands , all those unconscious little personal tricks of expression . There was detailed training in the tested methods of securing documents , courses in handwriting , frightfully complex and difficult study of codes and ciphers , invisible inks , sign messages . Above all , there was the constant inculcation of silence . Silence about the most insignificant details : some veriest trifle might fit into some other trifle in a shrewd opponent 's brain , and he might get a glimpse of a pattern which must remain utterly hidden . Silence on everything , to everybody , in health or illness , at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In laying and testing this essential foundation , our trainers did not hesitate to use agents provocateurs . At the caf ? or wineshop a pleasant stranger would buy drinks , strike up a conversation . Most subtly , after long desultory chat or amusing stories , he would lead the talk to some fact about our military force , some harmless reference to the Secret Service ? all in the most casual , innocent fashion , avoiding the least impression of interest or importance . But woe betide the neophyte who , drunk or sober , even so much as admitted the correctness of the other 's surmises . No later than the next day he would find himself before a stern , inexorable C. O. " At five-thirty-seven yesterday you said in the presence of a stranger thus and so . Do you really imagine , childish imbecile , that we will entrust the reputation of this Service , the safety of the nation , to one who has no more control of his tongue than a gossiping woman ? " And when the offender was reduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a suspended sentence . One such interview was enough to put the future agent constantly on guard against the whole world . Reticence became second nature . Everything real dwelt in a dark depth of the mind : should even the lovely little feet of the most alluring woman stray in that direction the sound was an instant warning ; all that hidden knowledge crept away to a still more inaccessible retreat . We learned the use of some highly specialized implements of our trade . Photographs were invaluable records in a hundred ways . Our camera was adapted from the ingenious device worked out by Lumiere for the French bureau : it was a stickpin adorned with diamonds the size of a ten-cent piece . Each stone was a magnificent Zeiss lens , working at F.3 , with universal focus up to one hundred feet . The tools became more grimly suggestive as we took up the approved methods of removing awkward human obstacles which stood between us and success in our missions . An agent must be a crack shot and thoroughly understand all sorts of explosives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wielder of sandbag and leaded cane . There were those who from racial instinct added most skilful knife-throwing to this armory of attack . We knew the disabling stroke with the side of the open hand against the carotid artery or windpipe ; the stunning or fatal blow at the base of the brain . We knew the precise effect of the dumdum bullets from automatic pistols , making a tiny hole on entering and a six-inch cavity on the other side : also the three spots at which to aim ? the jugular vein , the heart , just behind the ear . For when the time came to kill , as it surely would sooner or later , the killing must be cold-blooded , sure , instantaneous . One final , culminating weapon remained for the most dangerous missions : a tiny hypodermic syringe with prussic acid . Most of us added some other swift deadly injection to this equipment . I knew one agent who specialized in curare , that mysterious virus prepared by the Indians of the upper Amazon ; though the sale is strictly prohibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manaos , and through underground channels had obtained several of the poison-impregnated thorns , each good for five deadly little pricks . His clinical observations were that there was almost instant partial paralysis , death followed in about ten minutes , and the body turned black . I had my own superior rarity ? a West African hell-brew , said to be compounded from the venom of a small snake , like a garter snake , and the virus of the tsetse fiy . These melodramatic weapons were not for show . We used them . And they did their work . IV Since my retirement I have been met with cynical smiles when I casually mention something which was an everyday commonplace of the Service . Fiction writers have worn out certain obvious situations , just as certain excellent useful words become banal and shabby from over-use . Probably the following incident would strike many sophisticates as copied from a story , instead of being the literal fact it is . A battle-cruiser of a powerful country was being launched . The Captain gave a big luncheon in honor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I secured an invitation . No harm in seeing what these sea-dogs had got in their latest floating fortress . I noticed a little man painting away at some retouching , cap pulled down , absorbed in his mechanical job . My gaze kept coming hack to him : surely I had seen that face before . Making an opportunity , I came close and asked quietly , " I know you . Who are you ? " He glanced up with a quick smile , bent to his painting again . " I know your face , " I repeated . " Come to my room at my hotel to-night . " He came . But I could get nothing out of him except more of those amused , noncommittal smiles and little deprecatory bobs of the head . " All right , " I said finally . " You are of such nationality . I 've seen you before , somewhere . You need n't tell me anything if you prefer not . I shall know all about you presently . " He was a captain in his country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battle-cruiser . Yet there he was , an inconspicuous little workman , picking up every scrap of first-hand detail which keen eyes , shrewd brain , and great professional knowledge could gather . Why not ? The two countries might be allies , good friends . Still , no one could know what might happen . And the guiding minds of that foreign navy must know what even an ally considered the last word in guns and armor plate ? in speed and handling , in anything which could be " adapted " by one 's own designers . In looking back at my thirty years of experience , I remember it all , but half a dozen episodes stand out sharp as framed paintings . Were I an outsider and heard another man relate these little stories , I should most probably be convinced he was touching up the picture . Yet the incidents related are just what happened . In my work truth is miles ahead of fiction , and surveys terrain and happenings of which the second-hand story teller remains quite ignorant . I was dressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loafer , bought in a local slop-shop . Just an inconspicuous derelict , with the furtiveness natural to a down-and-outer . Elaborate disguise usually defeats itself . The experienced agent gets inside some surface too commonplace to be noticed : a workman , a seedy member of the unemployed ? those are apt to be perfect masks . Not one chance in a thousand that any responsible person will so much as look at your face . Why should he , when you are so obviously just one more member of the ever-present and possibly troublesome proletariat ? In the afternoon of a raw winter day I slouched through the streets toward the harbor ? that harbor upon which had been spent millions , and then more millions ? to make it one of the world 's most impregnable naval bases . My job was to get photographs and notes of the fortifications if possible . But , above all , I must bring facts about the great locks by which the fleet of new sea-hornets returned to safety from their ocean dashes . These must be operated electrically ? but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a military strategist than exact details of such a vulnerable heart to a great war mechanism , whose owners may some day be in the enemy class . Martial efficiency rejoices in the mental vision of one good " egg " striking that center and crippling the whole elaborate mechanism on which depends the usefulness of the locks . Thickets came down near the shore in places . Sentries , each with a beat of fifty paces , patrolled the whole stretch opposite the locks ; on the retaining walls of the latter guards kept watch . After long hanging about , and scrutiny of these structures , I could see not the slightest indication of any control chamber . Dusk fell . As the darkness settled down , I slipped gently into the icy water . Very quietly I inched my way through a bed of reeds . Then , with the numbing water up to my shoulders , I worked my way out toward the lock . The slow minutes were as monotonous as the lap of the little waves against the concrete walls . I thought nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts , I should be too numb to turn back and escape . All my mental powers were concentrated in a complete alertness , ready to catch any least hint of the secret I must pierce . Hours passed . There is a second wind in suffering as well as in running . When a resolute mind refuses to admit the pain upon the lighted stage of consciousness , tortured nerves after a while lose some of their capacity for feeling . Deep night settled down upon land and harbor and sea outside . No moon , no stars . I had figured on that . There was no sound except the measured tread of the sentries , the provoked slap of the waters against this manmade obstruction . Midnight had passed long before : that meant I had but three or four more hours before even the sullenest dawn would betray me . If any favoring quirk of chance were to aid , it must come soon . Impossible to guess even what form this piece of luck might take . Concentrate your whole being into attention of every sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the lock . One of the veritable sea-hornets returning from a cruise by the canal . No excitement : " excitement makes your needle lose the North . " Only a more tense readiness of senses to grasp at the first indication of the mystery . Floodlights beat on the stone walls . The slender , pointed , wicked-looking craft advanced between them to a point where she must evidently rise to the next level to proceed . And then eyes and ears seized the answer . A uniformed officer passed along the gangway on top of the wall , entered a low dome-shaped structure a third of the way along the lock . Wondering when I should step into some hole and plunge over my head , Iworked my way to a point opposite the window in this dome , and not more than ten paces away . I looked into a dimly lighted room . The engineer lieutenant was there , handling levers . Gradually the masts of the vessel began to rise . At the end of seven or eight minutes she had lifted to the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . I understood everything . I could draw a map from memory , placing that domed control chamber within a few feet of its actual location . The information was secured . Naturally , that was not all . I was in the water , between sentries on the lock and patrols on the shore . What had been accomplished meant nothing unless I could get away with my mental booty , Very cautiously I worked my way back through the water toward the spot where two sentry-beats met . Even this gentle movement was welcome after those motionless hours . The patrols did not speak as they came to their respective boundaries , but the beat of their feet told me where they were every moment . At Last one sentry was relieved . The new man stopped for a few seconds to speak to the other . Before he started his patrol I was creeping up the bank toward the nearest tongue of woods . I crawled like a snake ? and kept on crawling till I was far out of hearing . Reaching the outskirts of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest large city , where my orders bade me deliver what I had secured to our Consul 's diplomatic pouch . I had succeeded . But I can say honestly there was almost no elation . No reaction of tense nerves , no overpowering sense of relief and triumph bade me celebrate with some vintage cognac . It was only a job , like a thousand others . Yet after twenty-five years I admit I can still hear the lap lap of those little gray waves , and see that officer throwing the control lever , and feel the briars and stubs that raked me as I bellied my way up from the shore of deadly peril to the safe woods . V I suppose that a man going through the crisis I learned to meet must have many emotions in his subconscious self of which he is nut aware . I can say that I had no sense of fear or excitement . I knew of course that the possibility of shameful failure or death might burst upon me at any moment . But I never experienced a flutter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the directing will had learned to stifle such emotional reactions . Grand Duke Nicholas with a Russian army had captured the ancient city of Trebizond , on the south side of the Black Sea . Enver Pasha and his German military tutor , Von der Goltz , decided that this was too close to their military nerve center ; they were planning to send a force against the Russians . We too wanted the exact plan of operations , also the size of the guns in the shore forts and what reserves of ammunition they had . While one was about it , the location of the mines in the Dardanelles might come in handy . That was my chore . I completed the slow , roundabout rail trip from Salonika to Adrianople , passed on through , and met , at a remote country hut , an Armenian in the Service employ . He lived in Istambul and had come up there to pass me through the Turkish lines . The method was picturesque and simple . Along came a convoy of peasant laborers , bringing essential tobacco from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lying back in an oxcart , I was no more conspicuous than any other as we creaked and jolted our snail-like way . Awkward questions from my fellow tobacco haulers were checked by my guide 's pitying comment that I was partly deaf and entirely dumb . We passed the sentries at the city gate without the slightest incident . At once I got in touch with another Armenian who was handling the direct communications with the man who wasto provide those plans . Very soon I met this essential person ? about 5 P. M. on a rowboat in the Bosporus . He proved to be a tall , handsome Turkish officer with a black mustache , who was on Enver Bey 's staff . He was well-educated and keen ; and he explained that he himself was of Armenian birth . From the moment when Mutagh Bey decided terror must be struck into the hearts of the rebellious Armenian " dogs " and ordered those wholesale ruthless massacres , which our new acquaintance had witnessed in horror , a deep hidden passion for revenge had burned in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so complete , he explained , as ruining all the plans and hopes of these savage oppressors by getting me what I wanted . That would be easy , owing to his position of confidence on the Turkish General 's staff . I politely applauded a resolution so helpful to my effort . And even when he justified all the sayings about the bargaining proclivities of his race , I refrained from any comment on the result of mixing eagerness for money with patriotism . We agreed on a price . It was large , but the plans were worth it . " I can secure everything you wish , " said the officer on parting . " But you must give me a few days . You will have to be ready at any moment , for it may be impossible to notify you in advance . I have fooled Enver 's spies so far . But they are very clever and terribly persistent . " I assured him we should be ready at the Armenian 's house , day and night , and we separated furtively . We made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our call , telling him we should probably wish to be landed in a small Rumanian port on the Black Sea . Then we settled down to that hardest of all routines ? necessary inaction amid dangers that might burst upon us at any moment . The Armenian 's house was built round a central court of trees and flowers and fountain ; it was flat-roofed , with galleries , trellises , and vines . A pleasant enough abode under other circumstances . As it was , all I could do was again to discharge my mind of all speculation and be completely ready when the instant for action arrived . Several days went by in this taut quiescence . Then , at night , I was in an upper room with Mirochian , the Armenian guide who had turned me into a hauler of tobacco for Turkish cigarettes . The other Armenian , owner of the house , was below . Suddenly the Turkish officer rushed in at the ground-floor entrance , his face white , his eyes wild . " Where is he ? " he cried . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following ! Quick ! " " Up , fool , " said the Armenian , sitting motionless as before . " Up . Get away over the roofs . I will meet them . " The officer dashed up the stairs , thrust a parcel at me . " The money ! " he demanded . " Hurry . The money ? and let us fly , or we are all dead men . " I hurriedly examined the documents . The package did not contain everything we had bargained for , but it was a haul all right . We ran softly up to the roof , jumped over the parapet to the adjoining one . No go . The trap door leading down was fastened from below , not to be opened . To call would be fatal . We returned to our own house , descended the top stairway , sat down , hands on pistols , in a small room with an old sofa . I noticed with some surprise and contempt that Mirochian , my cheerful , resolute Armenian guide , promptly hid himself behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We heard voices and footsteps . A few moments after the officer had joined us , a squad of four police had entered below . Their leader confronted the impassive Armenian owner : " Where 's the Captain ? " " What Captain , Effendi ? " " The officer in Turkish uniform who entered this nest of traitors just now . " " No officer came into this room , Master . I was almost asleep , but I should have known had one entered . " " You lie , pariah dog . He came . I shall search the house . And when I find him I shall shoot you for the nasty jackal you are . " " That will be as the Master wills , " replied the Armenian submissively . The police officer hurried out , afire with the chase . " Search each floor so that no rat escapes , " he shouted to his men . " I will see to the roof and cut them off there . " Quick steps ascended while we heard doors slammed below , the frightened squeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ladderlike steps to the roof , when a cautious glance about showed him the open door of the room in which we were . Long years of bullying slavish subject races had removed all thought of possible resistance . He came right in , revolver drawn , but more from a sadistic pleasure at the thought of shooting somebody than from precaution . " So here you are , my little mice ? snug as possible , " he roared . " Comer he called to his men outside . It was death if we were imprisoned : I had the documents on me . Worse , it was open , shameful failure . I coldly threw up my hands in token of surrender . " All right , " I called out . The guide followed my example . The police officer turned sharp toward us , a horrible grin on his sallow face . That stopped my hand stealing toward the automatic in my belt . " Aha ! So we have ideas , have we ? Naughty , very naughty ? " The word broke off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armenian Mirochian behind the sofa rose and threw a long , sharp knife deep into his back . The other four policemen were just entering . I seized my automatic and shot fast . The guide shot too . In a moment two of the policemen were dead . The other two , whimpering and sobbing , had thrown down their guns and were begging for their lives . The officer lay face down , dead in a pool of blood . I was trained to kill swiftly when necessary , but never needlessly . Leaving those two alive did not greatly increase our danger . We tied them and hurried out . Making our way to the waterside , we signalled the fisherman . The honest fellow got the signal almost at once , rowed ashore , and put us aboard . It was nearly 2 A. M. The strictly enforced port regulation was that no boat of any sort could leave the harbor before daylight . It seemed foolhardy to sit there with those vital papers next my skin . I went to the anchor-chain locker , scrabbled some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents down , and covered them deep with anchor chain . Then there was nothing for it but to wait ? without speculating whether the bodies had yet been found , how soon the hunt would begin . Rarely have I looked with more pleasure upon an approaching dawn . Dressed as fishermen we fussed about the deck , tidying up the litter . The motor put-putted . We were off ? leaving the Turkish-Armenian officer , avenging patriot or traitor , to make his escape in another boat with the price of his patriotism . I heard later he managed to get into the British lines at Gallipoli , where he was made prisoner . The news meant little . He was already like a figure in last night 's dream . VI Another tense scene took place in a European capital . I was ordered to get the latest codes and some highly confidential reports , statistics , and plans . Those were staples in my strange business : you bought them at rates pretty well established by the importance of the material ? often modified by the necessities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haggle over the price like any pair of Hebrew junkmen . But a bargainer is severely handicapped when heknows , and the buyer knows , that pressing debts force him to sell . In this case , not at once discovering any obviously venal official in that particular government bureau , I decided to make it burglary instead of bribery . So I got a job as window-washer and general handyman in the War Department building ; and I succeeded in having employed as my helper a most entertaining scoundrel , whose nature and training fitted him for this special work . He was a Frenchman . He had worked in a safe factory till he could make the tumblers of a complicated lock sit up and beg ; then retiring from manufacturing he started a business of his own , taking a rigorous post-graduate course in safes of all makes as he came upon them , until there were few which he could not persuade without having recourse to raw violence . He was a unique combination of a marvellously skilful mechanic and a cold-blooded apache , knowing every trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciate his gifts , or perhaps he had not found the right job in which to exercise them . He shook off the dust of his ungrateful native land , and after an odyssey which would furnish material for a dozen picaresque novels , he arrived within our borders . Some alert scout of our Service , perceiving how handy a human instrument this might be on occasion , recommended him to our superiors . He had achieved a most complete internationalism ; he naturally took pleasure in the thought of tricking his native land which had , he felt , persecuted him because he was so much cleverer than most . Except for a sort of good-natured personal liking for myself and some of the others , he would just as readily have worked against us as for us . In fact , for a price , he was ready to work for or against any country in the world , being desirous mainly of frequent chances to show his varied and startling professional skill , and having enough money in his pocket for women and drink . He needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All we had to do was to understand him and use him . It took nearly three months of surreptitious spying to locate the safe which housed our prizes , to determine the make , to study the location of that little office and the possible ways of quick getaway , to chart the daily habits of the officer who was the responsible custodian of that particular strongbox . At last 1 was ready . Late one afternoon I hid with my safe-cracker pal in a little coat-and-broom closet of the office , facing the door . Everybody Ieft . The lights went out . Stillness settled down upon the deserted war department offices . As soon as it was safe we entered the little inner room . Like any honest skilled workman who loves to exercise his craft , my apache got busy without a word , lost in his delicate problem . In spite of his absorption , however , his sensitive perceptions caught the click of the latch on the door of the outer office . Instantly his powerful hairy hand smothered the flame of the stubby plumber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crouched there , holding our breath , 1 with an automatic gripped in my Left hand . Steps crossed the outer office . The inner door was pushed open . Stepping to the desk , the visitor flashed on the light . It was the officer in charge of that bureau . He had forgotten something , and it was our bad luck that he had returned for it . As the light fell on his startled face and waxed mustachio , it also gleamed on a pair of brass knuckles , evidently kept on the desk as a paper-weight . I was nearest . I jumped on him before his wits were fully functioning , and got in that disabling blow with the side of the open hand upon the windpipe . Automatically he had seized the brass knuckles at once ; his roundhouse swipe at me caught me over the eye , so that the skin hung over , and blood gushed down , blinding me on that side . My companion got in one cunning blow as the officer fell . Something more grim , however , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor devil , and I should be a marked man . There was only one thing to do . We gave him a prick with a thorn point soaked in that African poison ? then did not even watch him die , but returned to our job . Unfortunately the other papers had been removed , but we got the codes , which were most important . My efficient apache gave my wound first aid in the toilet , and we hastened silently out , down the deserted stairway and through a window from which we could reach the street . The calm moon shone brightly on the quaint buildings of the ancient capital . I blessed the architect who had loaded the outside of the office building with all that hideous encrusted ornament of baroque architecture which made descent so easy . My driver , a splendid exiled Alsatian , was waiting round the corner in a dark spot . In two minutes we were speeding out of the city . By circuitous side roads we made the border before dawn . There was no trouble ; our passports were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards into good humor . vII One might ask whether I realize how completely cynical my experience has made me . I prefer to call myself a realist . I take no responsibility for the world of men . 1 did not create them . I have used them as I found them , to do the job which came my way to do , and serve my country as ordered . For I was born , and have lived , a soldier . As a matter of cold fact , I have never met a man I needed to buy whom I failed to purchase . Some came much higher than others , but there was always a price . The men who could filch what I needed were not independent ; they were underpaid bureaucrats , men with a grudge , men who felt themselves unfairly treated by an impersonal , unfeeling Government . Such men are not independent ? far from it . They are daily going through the degrading process of trying to get a better job , or hold the one they have , by currying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any man is bound to become blunted in his finer sensibilities ; usually he is utterly demoralized ? ready for any momentary escape from the toils . For always these are men with a position to maintain , whose children must go to the right schools , whose wives must be properly dressed at official dinners and functions . Such men are always in debt . And a man deeply , irretrievably in debt can no longer afford the bright jewel of Honor . Hence the incongruous fact that the higher an official 's position , the easier he was to buy ? and the cheaper . He was harder pressed . It is only one man out of many who will not break under the steady , relentless torture of continuous , hopeless financial pressure . I took a sort of professional , clinical interest in marking the action of the idea of relief upon one of these unfortunates . In an important case I would look the man up before meeting him ? from acquaintances , bankers , anywhere . When we came together I knew a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and official prospects . The talk at first would be about anything interesting . Gradually I would begin to complain about the cost of everything , the impossibility of living on an official salary . That always brought sympathetic response . Then the general topic of financial gain , people who had made a lot quickly by some lucky coup . After a time , when it came to actual negotiation , his eyes would never meet mine . Always he would look away . But I learned to know from his expression when the amount mentioned was enough . If he was the kind without that odd courage to do a disgraceful thing at first , I would drop the subject , leave him to himself for a week or two . Only too well I knew that I had in his financial worries a ceaseless ally . Almost always it was he who brought about the next meeting . The rest was easy . An elderly colonel was anxious to be bought . He would turn over detailed plans of all his country 's fortifications . But he valued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact . Some instinct warned me as I negotiated with him ; but for once my confidence , after an unbroken run of successes without a hitch , made me disregard this inner monitor . The truth was that this ingenious colonel had decided to retain money , plans , and honor ? all three . His idea had the simplicity of greatness : alone with me , he would kill me and take everything . No one but himself would ever know . A meeting-place was appointed far away from both our headquarters , on the coast near Brindisi . It was a lonely house occupied by one of our men . The Colonel came swiftly in , looking about nervously . " Are we alone ? " he whispered . " You see , Excellency , " said I , waving my hand about the bare room . " Let us finish . Here are your plans . Where is the money ? " I stepped forward and handed him the package of large notes in my right hand , stretching out my left for the large envelope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside his cape , armed with a blackjack , and gave me a glancing blow on the forehead . Taken by surprise I was knocked down . The blow opened that former wound , and I was momentarily helpless . He had me at his mercy , and I could see his smile as he deliberately drew a pistol . But my local man had not taken any chances . He was watching at a cunning hole in the wall , concealed by a loose flap of figured wall-paper . When he saw the Colonel 's blow , he rushed to the door , levelled a big pistol , fitted with a silencer , and shot the Colonel through the heart . It was odd to lie there , hear the slight phht of the explosion , and see that officer topple forward on the floor almost at my feet . I was never over-given to trustfulness in my work , but that experience made suspicion of everybody an instinct . VIII In Bucharest , on a short furlough , I had become acquainted with an agent of a friendly country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a delightful vein of quiet humor . Temperamentally and professionally , really intimate friends were not for me ; yet I took considerable pleasure from his company . We separated , of course with not the slightest hint where either was going next . My assignment was odd enough ? to make a full report on the coast defenses of a fortified Oriental port . No stretch of the imagination could conceive of our invading that country . Still , secret agents do not question orders . I reached my destination , and found that all the harbor fortifications would be in plain view from up the steep hillside ? but the entire area was prohibited and strictly patrolled , with a military post on the crest of the mountain . One could go a short distance up the main road , toward the heights ; then a sentry would politely turn the visitor back . I started up , left the road some distance below the sentry post , plunged into the thick scrub , and painfully worked my way up toward a sort of slanting shelf , from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As I cautiously wriggled through the last thickets between me and my vantage point , I caught a glimpse of a human figure ahead , just at the spot I was making for . With all the stealth I could manage , I wormed my way toward him . Just as 1 had decided I was close enough to rush him , I was amazed to see that he was using a camera ? on those very fortifications I meant to photograph . My surprise must have made me careless . A dry twig cracked under my knee . The man whirled about quick as a flash , reaching for his pistol . Then he saw mystartled face peering through the leaves . He broke into a noiseless laugh , and waved his hand . It was my Bucharest friend , on the same mission as I ! We foregathered , compared notes , finished our work together . It had got on to perhaps four in the afternoon . Just as we were thinking of making our way back to the lower road with our booty , we heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sentry had evidently seen something suspicious and was corning to investigate . My companion sank out of sight behind some thick bushes . I concealed myself as best I could across the partly clear space in which we had been working . The crashing drew nearer , interspersed with violent language as some stub raked the sentry in a tender place . Presently he broke through close by me , hot , sweaty , and much out of humor . I stood up . We looked at each other . He jabbered angrily ; and while I could not understand a word , his sign language with his gun was all too clear . To hold his attention , I stepped toward him , talking loudly and gesticulating . My companion needed no prompting : as the sentry took a step backward , levelling his gun at me , my ally seized him from behind with a jiu-jitsu hold and swung him over his shoulder . The rifle flew through the air and crashed among the bushes . The man was too startled to make a sound . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both share in the finality . With a mighty heave we swung him over the precipice . No need even to glance over to see what happened down there . We stayed not on the order of our going from that place . For two weeks we lay doggo at the house of a countryman of my companion . Then we got away safely . Though the authorities made the most strenuous efforts to penetrate the mystery , all they ever knew was that this soldier was found at the base with a broken neck , while his rifle lay in the bushes far up the hillside .
