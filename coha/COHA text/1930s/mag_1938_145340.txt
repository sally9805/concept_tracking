" Blank Chocolate Manufacturing Co. held its monthly policy meeting last week . Present were its president , stenographers , chocolate mixers , office boys , each with one vote . Up rose an employe committee chairman to report . ' After careful study , ' said he , ' your committee recommends that the size of our nickel candy bar be doubled . ' After long discussion Blank Co. ' s policy-makers approved the recommendation by a majority vote and sent it to the board of directors . " <P> If any U. S. business were run in this fashion it might be deemed revolutionary . Yet that is the system under which Denver 's public schools have been run for a year . <P> Originator of this remarkable experiment in democracy is cool , grey-haired Alexander Stoddard , 49 , famed as chairman of the N. E. A. 's potent Educational Policies Commission . Nebraska-born , he taught in country schools , was superintendent in Bronxville and Schenectady , N. Y. and Providence , R. I. before he went to Denver last year under a five-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school systems the superintendent is an autocrat . But many have insisted that if U. S. schools are to produce democrats , they must be democratic in administration . Superintendent Alexander Stoddard had scarcely been introduced to his Denver staff before he took the boldest step toward that theory . He organized a Policies Council with principals , teachers , clerks , even janitors as members . Teacher representatives , elected by their fellows , numbered a majority . To decide major policies , 100 votes of the Council 's 175 and the Board of Education 's approval were necessary . Dr. Stoddard had one vote , no veto power . <P> This group formed committees to sift out proposals , which might be made by any one of Denver 's 1,700 school employes . They met in a high-school library the first Monday of each month to debate how Denver 's schools should be run . Soon they were studying how much homework Denver pupils ought to have , how big classes should be , when teachers should retire . <P> Most sweeping new policy adopted by the Policies Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Under this plan textbooks will be replaced by project guides , and 50,000 pupils are to make daily trips to factories , department stores , libraries , police stations , Government offices . Rockefeller General Education Board , in one of its rare gifts to public schools , contributed $5,000 to this project . <P> Most cheering outcome to Superintendent Stoddard is a new enthusiasm and alertness among Denver 's teachers . <P> Superintendent Stoddard has only one more year at Denver . Combing the nation to fill one of the biggest jobs in the U. S. , Philadelphia recently tapped him to be its superintendent . Denver agreed to release him from his contract only if he would stay another year . When he goes to Philadelphia next fall Superintendent Stoddard hopes to establish a similar council there . Says he : " It marks a trend . "
