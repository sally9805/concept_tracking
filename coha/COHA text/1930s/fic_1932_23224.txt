MR . DENNIT 'S GREAT ADVENTURE A STORY BY WALTER D. EDMONDS O N A bright Tuesday morning , late in May , 1836 , Atwater Dennit , the warehouse clerk for Jones and Trumbull , Feed and Provision Merchants in Utica , came hurriedly down the front steps of his small Bleecker Street house . At half a glance it was evident that this was an unusual procedure for Mr. Dennit . In the first place , just as he set foot on the narrow boardwalk , the bell in the great white spire of the Presbyterian church on Washington Street bonged out the hour of eleven . In the second place , though he was dressed in his shiny , every-day blue coat that showed green at shoulders and elbows and wore his gray high Lafayette hat ( outmoded now by some ten years ) , he was carrying a carpet bag in his right hand . In the third place , when he remembered at the end of the block that he had forgotten to shut the door , he did not have to hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at marketing . He had been able to slip in and pack his bag , to write a note for her explaining why he would not be able to wait for her . He was on particular business for Mr. Trumbull . Mr. Dennit was very conscious of the particular business , for he carried it in a thin belt next his skin  --  five hundred dollars to be delivered to Mr. Jones in Syracuse by seven o'clock on Wednesday morning . Mr. Trumbull had Nom ' intended to take it out himself , but a card party bad turned up that he did n't care to miss , and he had offered the commission to Mr. Dennit . They had intended to send someone out to audit Waverly 's accounts in Rochester anyway  --  Mr. Trumbull had put his beefy hands on Mr. Dennit 's narrow shoulders  --  why could n't Mr. Dennit combine the two , hey ? And make it into a holiday for himself , hey ? After all , he had been with Jones and Trumbull for fifteen years without a holiday . Even now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he thought of it  --  a holiday  --  he had never been out of Utica in his life . Mr. Trumbull had said there was no danger . " Nobody will suspect you of carrying that belt of money , Dennit , my lad ! Just wear that hat of yours ! " Mr. Trumbull had rocked up and down and roared with laughter . But it was a lot of money to be responsible for . Mr. Dennit looked covertly right and left to see if any of his neighbors had observed him . But except for the water cart with its drowsy yoke of red and white oxen , and Mr. Brierly 's smart pair of chestnuts at the corner of Chancellor Square , the street was unnaturally quiet . So Mr. Dennit set out . He lifted his thin face and breathed in the sun-filled air . Nesting sparrows were twittering in the branches of the Square elms . Overhead in the bluest sky that ? Mr. Dennit had ever seen , great white fleecy clouds were floating . A flock of crows were winging their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he barely heard their cawing . His mild brown eyes were shining , his puckered forehead smoothed until it became almost bland , his inoffensive pursed lips twitched an instant , then his mouth opened with pure pleasure . He was on a holiday ! It was at that particular instant that the church bell bonged . Instinctively , Mr. Dennit 's hand strayed to his waistcoat . He yanked out the heavy silver watch . Eleven o'clock . Before he could breathe he heard the warning notes of the packet boat 's bugle floating over the drowsy city noises . Mr. Dennit sprang like a hare . His thin knees lifted into a run . With his right hand he grabbed the brim of his Lafayette hat , in his left the carpet bag swung wildly back and forth against his shanks . His old shoes , newly polished , flashed up and down under the strapped snuff-yellow trousers . His cravat worked free of his waistcoat , the black ends fluttering ; and the narrow tails of his blue coat rose and sank at every stride . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The passage agent of the Red Bird Line regarded Mr. Dennit with undisguised surprise . " Atwater Dennit ! Where are you going to ? " " Syracuse . " Mr. Dennit just managed to get out the word . " Want a passage , hey ? " Mr. Dennit nodded breathlessly and mopped his pink cheeks with his frayed handkerchief . " Well , " said the agent , " you get your dinner and supper on the boat , thirty cents apiece . Fare costs a cent and a half a mile . Sixty-one miles makes ninety-two cents . One fifty-two does the trick . Always did and always will . " Mr. Dennit fished in his old black leather purse , getting out an Oneida bill , four York shilling-pieces and a lip . The agent looked at the bill , turning it this way and that : then he bounced the shillings on the counter of his little office . " I do n't trust a York shilling very good , " he said . " Howandever , I might as well chance it . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces while Mr. Dennit alternated his gaze between the waiting boat and Abel Whitely 's grimy hand . There was a touch of whiskey smell about the agent , though he looked sober enough , but his small eyes twinkled over his swollen red nose . " Do n't rush yourself , Atwater . That brute ca n't start his boat until I give the word , for all he blows his horn so loud . I never knowed you was a traveling man . What are you doing in Syracuse ? " Mr. Dennit was putting the pennies into his purse . Now he reached down for the bag he had been holding between his legs , and tried to say in an offhand manner , " Just a business trip for Mr. Trumbull . " " Auditing ? " Mr. Dennit nodded casually . " Auditing Waverly 's accounts . " " Waverly ? He 's in Rochester . What are you doing in Syracuse ? " " An errand . Our company 's got houses in Syracuse and Rome and Montezuma and Rochester and Buffalo , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones and Trumbull . " The agent eyed Dennit 's face . He noticed little prickles of sweat on the thin high forehead . " Well , Atwater , you know your business ; but if anyone asked me , I 'd say you was making off with the company dollars . " He was surprised at the sudden blanching of Mr. Dennit 's face . The latter had pulled his high gray hat lower over his eyes  --  of all people to wear a Lafayette hat ! ? and stared right and left . Then he turned back to Abel Whitely and affected laughter . " Do n't tell on me , " he muttered . The agent guffawed . His eye met the captain 's eye and the captain 's eye was angry . " All right , Atwater . Hop on . " He raised his voice . " Saunders ! " " Yeanh " " That gent 's for Syracuse , paid down ! " he bawled . " Haul out . " Mr. Dennit ran to the boat and up the gang . As he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said to a man in a black top hat and a neat black coat , " Lost us all of two minutes . " " I 'm very sorry , " said Mr. Dennit . The captain grinned , stuck his bugle through his whiskers , and broke out an intricate call . Mr. Dennit could hear the notes floating off above the noises of the town . A couple of idlers were tossing in the tie ropes and the steersman was coiling them round the cleats in the forward deck . The driver boy in his red coat climbed up on the rope-horse . He snapped his whip over the leader 's withers . The horses took up the tow rope , the boat gave a series of infinitesimal jerks under Mr. Dennit 's feet , and the packet swung away from the dock . The bugle notes lifted jubilantly as the boat gathered way . The team was struggling into a trot . Fresh horses ; their collars and traces were shining black , the brass on their bridles glittered in the sun . A little whisper of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stern . Mr. Den-nit heard it lapping along the dock planks . He could feel the breeze in his face . Ahead , the Genesee bridge made a dark tunnel . A freight-boat team swung out for them , letting their slack rope trail in the water while the boat nosed wide to the far side . They passed between . The faces of people looking down from the bridge were reflected whitely in the water . People who knew took the Red Bird Packets ; good food and speed ; Syracuse in just under fifteen hours ; Schenectady to Buffalo in four days ; regular as time . Mr. Dennit glanced along the shining red walls of the saloon and cabin , the white windows and the yellow blinds . The Rochester Belle was one of the company 's crack boats , and he was on it . " Steward ! " shouted the captain . " Show this gent where to drop his bag . What 's your name , sir ? " " Atwater Dennit . " " Pleased to know you . Hope you 're comfortable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The saloon took half the length of the boat , thirty-five feet , three windows on each side . It was handsomely paneled in maple , with a maple floor . The deckboards that made the ceiling were painted white , but the arched rafters were maple . Down the middle were two long tables at which the passengers ate . Under the rear deck a small cubicle housed another table and four or five chairs beside two small bookshelves . Two passengers , obviously husband and wife , were glancing through the last Albany papers . There were perhaps twenty other passengers scattered through the saloon . most of them men , traveling west on business . The steward led Mr. Dennit to a forward corner and showed him his berth , an ingenious iron frame , like a stanchion , hinged against the wall . Laced to the frame was a piece of canvas . " That 's yours , sir , " said the steward , and ducked through a door in the left front wall to the kitchen . A couple of men in natty clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely leave his bag . One of them got up in a leisurely fashion and swaggered across to Mr. Dennit . " Name 's Markus , " he said , extending a slim soft hand . Mr. Dennit turned round and smiled uncertainly . " Dennit , Atwater Derma , " he said , " at your service . " Mr. Markus placed the toe of a polished boot on the seat of a chair and rested his chin on his hand . He smiled guilelessly at Mr. Dennit . " Off on business ? " " Yes , sir . " " Long trip ? " " Not to speak of . Just to Syra-cuse . " " Well , it 's a nice boat . Nicely run . Fast . I ca n't stand any other line . I 've tried them all , Ohio and Erie , Michigan , Blue Lions , Ohio boats . " " Dear me , " said Mr. Dennit . " You must have to do a great deal of traveling . " " Quite a bit , " said Mr. Markus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Traveling for a company ? " " Yes , " said Mr. Dennit . " Jones and Trumbull . " " Big people , " said Mr. Markus with admiration . Mr. Dennit felt himself important . " Now my business keeps me moving , but it 's small . One-man stuff . " He peered through the window . " Noisiest basin in the line , I 've always thought . But it looks thriving . " He glanced over his shoulder . " Hope I 'll see more of you. ? Look here , come over and let me introduce you to a friend . " He took Mr. Dennit delicately by the elbow and led him over to his companion . " Mr. Dennit , let me make you acquainted with Mr. Burton . John Burton . First-rate fellow . Jack , Mr. Dennit 's traveling for Jones and Trum-bull . " A glance flashed between them as Mr. Burton got up and bowed . " Very pleased . " Like his friend , Mr. Burton was well dressed . Mr. Dennit bowed . His thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packet traveling could be so pleasant . " Join us ? " suggested Mr. Burton , motioning to a couple of glasses . " Morning beer is a great thing for traveling . " Mr. Dennit was tempted . But the thought of the deck sights was too much for him . " Thank you , sir . Not just now . I believe I 'll run upstairs for a moment . Just for the air , you know . I 've been in the office all morning . " " Sit with us at dinner , " suggested Mr. Burton . " I 'd be delighted . " " We might kill some time afterwards with a touch of the cards , " said Mr. Burton . Mr. Dennit started . " I 'm not a card player . I hardly know any games . " Mr. Markus laughed . " We 're nothing . Black jack , sledge , euchre , that 's our limit . " " Well , " Mr. Dennit said dubiously , " it sounds very pleasant . " He managed to hack away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's deck and stood beside the man . It seemed to him that the sky had never been so blue , the clouds so white , the water so sparkling . The spring sun shed a golden warmth over the long basin , bringing out the colors of boats that had been newly painted . Greens , blues , reds , magentas , yellows , and whites : their reflections , broken by the packet 's passage , threw glittering spots of color against the docks . Boats were everywhere . Men swarmed in the pits while others rolled down barrels from the warehouses . Invisible men were lowering crates from the overhanging second stories . Mules stood about . Voices were lifted on boats and on shore ; the curse of a man with a barrel , the shouts of men catching swinging crates ; a driver hollering " Back , you ! " to a team as he hooked on the tow-rope ; a woman crying out at a child ; back east , the blow of a horn for the weigh-lock . It was a babel . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he had never listened to it from the water . His eyes found Jones and Trumbull 's , a great red warehouse . A tackle swung from the second story . A brown boat was loading . He saw Candler , the watchman , sitting on his accustomed bucket inside the yawning door . Mr. Dennit 's narrow chest arched . The easterly breeze was fresh and cool , and thick with the smell of the docks : of flour , of pork , and grain , of potatoes , of stove wood , and iron farm machinery : and in the midst of it , as a boat passed , a smell of sage . He looked at the boat . The steersman leaned against the rudder . A woman was stretching clothes on a line over the pit . The driver lurched along behind the mules , dragging his whip like a tail . Mr. Dennit breathed deep . Their faces might seem hard , but they were free . Their very curses lacked care . They worked for their living , but their work took them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Dennit was traveling with them . " Do you think we 'll have rain ? " he asked the packet steersman . " Surely will . I 'd say we 'd get some showers in a couple of hours . " " That 's too had . " " Yes , " said the steersman . " Specially if you got to stand out here and take the worst of it . " Mr. Dennit eyed him . It had n't occurred to him that boaters were ever uncomfortable . " Well , " he said uneasily , " I think I 'll just get up on top for a spell . " " You 'll just have to come right down , " said the steersman . " You could n't even lie down under that bridge . " He spat overside . " Even me , standing here , I 've got to take my hat off . " Mr. Dennit eyed the bridge : two stone abutments and sleepers laid over ; eight feet above water ; and the boat was seven . Even as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . At the bow end of the deck , the captain 's head uprose . He gave his horn a toot . " Bridge ! " cried the driver 's high voice . " Low Bridge ! " bawled Captain Saunders . " Low Bridge ! " the steersman echoed him gutturally . The bridge glided towards them ; to Mr. Dennit 's romanticized eyes it seemed to swoop over them . There was an instant of cool shadow , of loud lapping water . Looking back , he saw the entrance to the long basin small in the distance , as if the bridge framed it in a picture . They were out of Utica . Faintly on the east wind he heard the bell in the high white spire of the church bong once . " Why' n't you go up forward ? " said the steersman . " There 's chairs to set on . There 's only three ladies in the ladies ' cabin and they 're all down in the saloon . You can see out at the country better until we get clear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top . " " That 's a good idea , " said Mr. Dennit . There was a twelve-inch catwalk past the saloon windows on either side of the boat . He chose the outside walk , maneuvering his feet carefully and keeping a hand on the top deck rail for support . He passed the saloon windows to the kitchen window . The pipe was right beside his head . It breathed heat into his face , and the acrid scent of a hot wood fire . Through the open window he smelled roasting beef , potatoes , and frying parsnips . It seemed to him that he had never smelled anything so delicious in his life , and he wondered how he could manage to wait tilt noon . He avoided looking into the three forward windows of the ladies ' cabin , and edged himself round the corner . The forward deck was a small place , low over the water , with room for half a dozen chairs . The captain was sitting there with the gentleman in black . " Sit down , Mr. Dennit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that the captain remembered his name ! ) " Enjoying your trip ? " The man in black addressed Mr. Dennit courteously . He was obviously a gentleman , with an educated voice . " I certainly do enjoy it , " said Mr. Dennit . In the flush of his happiness he could n't help confiding in them . " You see , it 's my first trip on a packet . " The captain 's beard parted . But his eyes fell on the clerk 's face , his flushed cheeks and his sparkling eye . He grunted . " Look here , " he said , " let me make you two gents acquainted . Mr. Dennit , Mr. Wallet . Mr. Wallet 's in business in Albany . One of my regular passengers . " Mr. Wallet bowed . " I 've got to go down , " said the captain . " Dinner 's in half an hour . " He left them together . " You 've no idea how I 'm enjoying myself . " Mr. Dennit leaned confidingly over to Mr. Wallet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you something . I thought I 'd pretend I 'd traveled a lot . But I 'm not going to . You see I 'd Inse half the fun . " Mr. Wallet nodded sympathetically . Mr. Dennis . felt that there was nothing more to say . You did n't have to talk to this gentleman ; he understood . So he composed himself to watch the clouds , the water , and the banks sliding by . His heart surged beneath his waistcoat . He thought of the dusty office he had quitted , the noise of the city , the hurrying people , and in this placidness he experienced a lifting gratitude even towards Mr. Trumbull . Mr. Wallet tapped his knee . " Perhaps , " he said , " I 've no right . But I just thought I ought to warn you . I overheard those two gentlemen inviting you to a game of cards . " Mr. Dennit started . " Yes ? " " Well , I think , as one gentleman to another , I ought to warn you that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Dennit in hushed tones . Mr. Wallet nodded soberly . " But they were so cordial ! " " Naturally . It 's part of their lay  --  their business , " Mr. Dennit felt as though his world had dropped out from under him . " What will I do ? " he cried . " Why , just keep clear of them . " " But I promised to play . I practically promised . " " Well , feel indisposed . Travel sickness . Something like that . " Mr. Wallet seemed genuinely anxious to help him . " Do you think ? " Mr. Dennit hesitated . His face was quite pale now , and there was a kind of misery under his eyes . " Do you think they 'd rob a person ? " Mr. Wallet laughed reassuringly . " They 'd hardly dare on the boat . Anyway I 'll look out for you . " " Thank you , thank you very much . I  --  I have n't much experience , you see . It is n't that . You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About three o'clock to-morrow morning . " " That 's very fortunate , " said Mr. Wallet . " I 'm leaving the boat then too . We can keep together . " He gave Mr. Dennit a keen , friendly glance , then looked away . Mr. Dennit looked out over the banks . It seemed to him that the sunlight was gone from the world . Indeed , he could see clouds mustering behind them in the east . But then he felt perhaps he was fortunate anyway . If it had not been for this gentleman , he would have fallen right into the hands of those two robbers . But he was still troubled . He felt uncomfortable , his belt chafed him now , though before he had hardly been aware of it . Something induced him to be artful in his question . " Mr. Wallet . Supposing  --  supposing a clerk was carrying a large sum of money . " " Yes , " said Mr. Wallet , encouragingly . " Do you think , supposing he was , that he would do better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , supposing he was on a packet ? " Mr. Wallet stared thoughtfully at his boots . " Do you know , I think it would be better not . It would be difficult to do it inconspicuously . Of course , if your supposititious clerk thought the rogues had particular knowledge of his charge , he might pass it on to a trusted friend . " Mr. Wallet paused for the fraction of a second ; then he shook his head . " But on a boat , no , I think he had better keep it . " Mr. Dennit had been listening with a heart full of woe , his eyes on the cleat that held the towrope . As Mr. Wallet finished , Mr. Dennit turned on him suddenly , and surprised an extraordinarily sharp glance from the gentleman 's eyes . " By God , " said Mr. Wallet , turning his eyes away . " It makes me boil to think of those rogues allowed to travel in decent company ! " " Yes , " cried Mr. Dennit , relieved by he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallet got up suddenly . " I must go down . I 'll sit with you at dinner , if you like . " " Oh , thank you . But I promised those men . " " Then I 'll sit just across . They ca n't do anything . Cheer up . Enjoy the trip . I promise you they wo n't take a cent . " His hand jerked suddenly inside the cuff of his coat . It reappeared holding a small four-barrelled derringer . " I 'm prepared . It 's a habit . So do n't worry . " He walked jauntily back . Enjoy the trip ! Mr. Dennit could have wept . What fearful luck ! His only holiday disturbed by a couple of ruffians . Then his face brightened . He was really lucky to have scraped acquaintance with Mr. Wallet and found so true a friend . He thought of the derringer and smiled . Mr. Dennit gave his attention to the canal . Behind him the steersman shouted , " You might as well get on top , Mister . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his word . From his new eminence he could see out over the riverside meadows , the Mohawk flowing sluggishly through its coiling channel . The brilliance was out of the air ; there was a faint mistiness . And back where Utica lay , a dark shadow slanted to eatth . It must be raining . The horses had subsided into a walk . Through Whitesboro they had trotted ? a kind of advertisement for the line  --  with the driver shrilling , and the captain playing a , bar of " Anacreon " on his bugle . Mail was tossed on board from the dock and a bag thrown hack in exchange . They had not stopped once . Now they were in the open country . Ahead , Mr. Dennit saw a couple of boats approaching and a line boat going away . Twenty minutes to catch the line boat , said the steersman . They were doing a mile and a half an hour better time . Red Bird packets were surely fliers . Mr. Dennit , facing forward , heard a cough , turned round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , sir . My name is Prentice . I 'm a minister of the gos-pel . " Mr. Dennit doffed his hat to the old man 's white hair and cloth . " My name is Atwater Dennit , " he said . " Mr. Dennit , " said the old man soberly . " Just a word . It 's for your own good . I 'm a minister and , I trust , an honest man . I 've traveled the canal often . I saw you speak just now to a man named Markus and a man named Burton . " " Yes , " said Mr. Dennit , his eyes bewildered . " They asked you to cards ? " " Yes . " " I make no comment on the practice . But I can see that you 're not an experienced traveler . Those men were interested in you . When you bent down to put down your bag , your coat tails parted and an excrescence was visible at your waist . Then they spoke to you . Sir , they 're gamblers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " said Mr. Dennit . " I have been already made . " Mr. Prentice held up a white hand . " Listen , sir . Did your information come from the gentleman who calls himself Wallet ? " " Why , yes . " " Let me warn you . Those three often travel in company . I should beware of him above all others . I do n't know what your mission is . But they have made up their minds tosomething . Just now Wallet came down and spoke to Markus . Just a word as he passed . I was reading nearby . Wallet said , ' Easy . ' That was all . Do you understand ? " Mr. Dennit was staring at him with stricken eyes . " I had better go down . You 're safe on the boat . It is better that they should n't see us talking . Good day . " " Stop , " cried Mr. Dennit . " What will I do ? " " Keep your head and trust in the Lord , " suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went below as if he had rescued a soul and solved for it all earthly problems . But poor Mr. Dennit 's soul was shrunk by a spasm . For an instant he thought wildly of jumping to the bank and hiding in the fields . But his best blue tail coat was in his bag . And just then the steward 's bell rang for dinner , and the wind blew gustily and rain began spattering the deck . Mr. Dennit summoned his nerve and went down . As he passed , the steersman said , " Did n't I prophesy ? And me out here like a rotten sponge . " Mr. Dennit entered the saloon . Burton and Markus waved to an empty seat between them . The steward backed him with a steaming platter of red slices in thick brown gravy . Mechanically , Mr. Dennit helped himself to potatoes and to parsnips and pickles . Whatever was passed he accepted . His plate was heaped before him . He sat looking down dismally on the mountain . His appetite had fled . A large glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He gulped a stinging swallow of it and mustered nerve to look around . Across the board he met Wallet 's encouraging eye . He shrank under his coat as he thought of the derringer , and lowered his face . Down the table the clergyman was helping himself and eating with gusto . Beside him Mr. Markus suggested wine . " A little madeira ? How about it , Mr. Dennit ? They carry a good bottle of Graby 's Red Seal . No ? Sherry , perhaps ? Holloway 's Port then ? No ? Brandy like a true blue . I agree . Nothing like brandy . Touch of travel sickness ? Phuh ! Gone in a couple of hours . Take a turn after lunch if the rain lets up . By George , listen to it ! " The saloon had grown shadowed . The pictures of Washington , of Lafayette , of Clinton in the garb of a Roman Emperor , were specters against the walls . On the boards overhead , rain drummed louder and louder , until the sound of the fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the windows , showing the canal bank livid white , the grass like bending ghosts , and the black skeleton of a broken tree . The thunder rumbled down upon them . The steward entered with a long match to light the lamps swung from the rafters . People talked little . At the second table , a traveler remembered a story and proceeded to tell it . The others listened in silence . Mr. Dennit did not hear a word . He nibbled his food , saw his scarcely touched plate give way to pie , drank some coffee . The belt round his waist seemed to communicate a chill to his insides . He did not know whether to be glad that the meal was over or to apprehend the advances of the rogues on either side of him . As he feared , they suggested cards , but he pleaded a headache , and Mr. Wallet sympathetically suggested that he be given a comfortable chair under the rear windows . Markus and Burton started a card game . The minister retired to a far corner and read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in the semi-darkness while the ' rain sloshed over the banks of the canal he considered what he should do . He thought he might escape at Rome and make for the company office , but when Rome came in sight at three fifteen , Mr. Wallet kindly left a game of euchre to sit down beside him with a newspaper , under cover of which he whispered , " Everything 's going to be all right . They do n't suspect us , I believe . You acted finely at lunch . " Mr. Dennit writhed . He did not dare get up . There were no passengers , the captain was in a hurry . The new team was brought out . In five minutes they were on their way . The rain continued with a steady roar . The thunder had long since marched overland ahead of them , but the darkness remained . Little of the country was visible beyond the windows . Outside , the driver boy was hunched like a wet red burr on the top of his bay rope horse ; and both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east-bound packet from Montezuma slid past with a bare exchange of bugle notes . From time to time they passed freight boats , the drivers sludging through the mud , the steersmen hunched inside their coats , the rain spouting from their wide hat-brims . Three miles out of Rome they passed Wood Creek and entered the Blacksnake of the Long Level . The boaters had named it for the twisting course of the canal through an eternal swamp of pine and hemlock . Again and again set-backs like ponds branched off from the canal . In some places the towpath gave way to a floating bridge , and the horses ' hoofs thumped heavily . The travelers became more and more silent . The card game was given up . Some men stood glowering at the windows . Traveling , thought Mr. Den-nit , was the most miserable thing in the world . But at five o'clock , a cold breath cut through the airless windows . Suddenly the rain stopped . And even as they watched the clouds breaking , there came a shrill cry from the towpath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the bank . The captain 's boots pounded forward over-head ; and then in the bows his voice was profanely uplifted . " We 've hit something . " " A boat sunk in the channel ! " " Tom ! " A woman 's voice . The steersman bawled through the open door at them . " Do n't get flustrated . No harm to the boat . We 're just agin the bank . " Mr. Dennit lifted his head . Like a kind of promise of better things he saw the sun way westward at the end of a straight stretch of the canal . He picked up his hat and followed the minister on deck . The captain had jumped ashore dragging a tie-rope behind him . " You 'd better get off and hold in the stern , " he shouted to the steersman . He swung on the driver boy . " Why in hell do n't you watch where you 're going ? " The boy rose up out of the grass , a smear of mud across his face . Then Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The animal 's eyes were wide , his nostrils red He gave a lurch , and then a shudder ran down his neck , and his eyes closed .

" bawled the captain . The boy pointed . " He 's broke his leg . " " Oh Jesus ! " said the captain . " Now I 'm scrummed . " He stamped ahead . " How did it happen ? " The boy was casting round . " There ' t is . " He pointed his hand . " That damned eternal muskrat hole got gouged out by the rain . The horse broke through . God , Mister Saunders , it ai n't my fault .

The captain turned round . " Any of you gents mind killing a horse ? Me , I ca n't do it . " Mr. Dennit blanched and backed behind the minister . There was a complete silence . After a moment , Mr. Wallet said , " If you 've got a heavy pistol or a rifle , I 'll do it . " " Thank you , Mister . Steward ! " The steward fetched a heavy horse pistol . Mr. Wallet took it , examined the cap , jumped on to the towpath , and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the ladies gave a little shriek . Mr. Wallet heard her and asked the captain for a handkerchief . The captain took one from his neck and handed it over . Mr. Wallet bound it expertly over the horse 's nose and mouth . " I do n't usually miss , " he said . He stepped back and levelled the pistol . There was a heavy report . A balsam , close by , shook down drops of rain . There was no movement from the horse . But Mr. Dennit felt his stomach small and cold like a little bag of icy water hung against his backbone . Mr. Wallet looked down at the thread of blue smoke trailing from the pistol mouth in his hand . Then he came aboard . And as he did so , the travelers , according to custom , began to bewail the delay . " Ca n't be helped . Ca n't even blame the driver , though he 's a lazy little brute , " said Captain Saunders . " I 'm sorry , ladies and gents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wait . " He stood looking at them over his black whiskers . " I 'll suggest something to pass the time . They 're some mighty good bass and catfish along here . Now I 've got hooks and some line aboard . What do you say ? push the boat over on the other side and let you off and you can fish . " " By Jupiter ! " exclaimed Mr. Markus . " That 's a suggestion ! I 'm not much of a fisherman , but I 'll put up four dollars for the biggest fish . Let 's make a pool ! " " With you , ' Kus , " said Mr. Burton , flashing a wallet . " Let 's make it two dollars , though , so everybody will feel they can come in . Let 's give it to the captain He can hand over the award at supper . " The idea took . Except for the minister , every man put up some money . " How about you , Mr. Dennit ? " asked the captain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a small boy . He had almost forgotten what it was like . And his mind was confused with all the events that had confronted it during the day . " It means thirty-eight dollars to you if you win , " suggested the captain . " Everyone else is joining up . " " Why , yes . I 'd be glad . " He pulled out his shiny old black purse and fished out a couple of dollars . It was a lot of money , a fearful lot , but he could n't appear backward . " Now , then , Steward ! " While the steward got the hooks and line and cut the latter into equal lengths the captain and the steersman poled the packet over to the far bank . They fastened it , bow and stern , to a couple of trees . The captain waved his arm . " Now , ladies and gents , we 'll put off supper till half past six . I 'll give a toot on my old bugle fifteen minutes before we leave . Here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Any man can cut him a pole to suit his own ideas . But he 's got to bring in his fish  --  and me , I weigh it . And I hold the right to examine the winner for shot or stone in his guts  --  that is I open up his fish if it suits , sec ? Now there 's the canal . Most anywhere you might catch most anything . " Mr. Dennit was enjoying himself . He was sitting on a fallen tree trunk that ran far out into a set-bark several hundred yards up the canal . He had a pole he had broken off a birch tree and trimmed nicely . And on the end of his line he had a prime fat worm he had found under a log . Carefully wrapped in his handkerchief were two more . And best of all , a minute ago he had had a most encouraging nibble . Already he was considering various ways of spending thirty-eight dollars . He had had a bad moment or two before he left the boat . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when he found that both Markus and Burton were going to fish from the deck , he had jumped over the side . After all , once out of sight in the woods , he could keep hidden until the bugle sounded . He would n't be worried by those sinister faces , and he could fish . This was really a treat . Something , he thought , would turn up at Syracuse . " Trust in the Lord , " said Mr. Prentice , and it was really the best advice . If the Lord would only send him an especial nice bullhead , everything would be all right . canal . And inside the deepest watter you 're going to catch a mammoth fish , Mister . " He went round to the other end . Mr. Dennit heard him grunting and wheezing . He had heard of shanty boats that appeared and disappeared along the canal . This was the first he had seen . There was a clatter of oars and presently the boat appeared , the old man bending in powerful strokes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its stern . Without stopping to think , Mr. Dennit stepped in . " All right , " said the old man , " now set . " He hegan to row back . He had powerful broad shoulders , but it was his face that interested Mr. Dennit 's attention . Just now it was wreathed in a whiskery grin ; but the eyes had a cold slant about them . Mr. Dennit suddenly asked , on top of his amazed thought , " How do you know about the boat ? " The old shanty-boater chuckled . " There 's lots of shanties round here . We know what goes by . Anyway I could hear Saunders a-cussing and a-swearing fit to cat a pole cat . Noises carry over watter . " Mr. Dennit felt relieved . " Are there many boats like yours ? " " Well now , ' pends on what you mean . Reckon , I do , there 's one or two to a set-back . This-here 's mine . Nobody dasst take it off me . I found the fishing . Kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he squinted round at his houseboat , " you might say , Mister , there 's a hundred boats in the ' Snake , ' maybe three hundred people . " " I had no idea . " " Not many does . We 've got arrangements . Do n't let more'n so many outside in a day . " " It 's amazing . How do you live ? " " Fishing . We send round fortune telling . Gypsies , kind of . We do a mite of hoss-trading . " He seemed perfectly willing to talk ; but at this moment they slid under the bow and with a huge hand he stopped the boat and steadied it for Mr. Dennit to get out . With a strangely active spring he jumped out beside the clerk . A twist of the painter fastened the boat . " Come along , Mister . " He led Mr. Dennit down thecatwalk to the porch . The windows near the bow were closed up with board shutters . The others looked into the main room . Mr. Dennit had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a big cupboard . The old man showed him a chair on the porch . " Set , " he invited . " You 're right over deep watter . What 's your bait ? " Mr. Dennit exhibited the worms with some pride . " Wait till I get you a piece of pork . " He slouched into the room and came forth with a small piece of whitish stuff in his broad fingers . Mr. Dennit smelled it easily . The man baited the hook for him . " Heave over . It 's a short line but the pool goes for the same length . I reckon they 'll nose up to you anyway . " He sat down on the boards and leaned against an upright . Mr. Den-nit was puzzled . " I do n't see how you learned about the pool . " " Gal , Lissa , was onshore when the horse went down . She listened . I said , ' Maybe one of ' em will come this way . Maybe I can get him the winner . ' Lissa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's young . Been acting up to be my boss . Thought I 'd best get him in family . Lissa was good bait . " " Is she your daughter ? " " Kind of . Lived with me since she was fifteen . But I 'm getting old . " " By the way , " said Mr. Dennit , " howl I get back to the boat ? " " There 's the bugle . You do n't need to worry about it though . I 'll fix you . " The old man 's eyes lifted sardonically . He grinned at Mr. Dennit . And for a moment Mr. Dennit was troubled . But just then he had the king of nibbles . And then he was hauling with all his might . The old man had rolled over on his naked chest , tucking his beard in not to wet it , and peering far override . " He 's a mammoth , " he shouted . " A real Masterman fish . People call these fishes Masterman fishes after me . There ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Dennit 's eyes were bright . His Lafayette hat was tilted far back on his head , showing the trace of baldness . His timid face glistened a bright beet red . " If the line holds , if the line only holds , " he prayed . " Oh Lord ! " " Pull , Mister ! Pull hard ! Set back against the mammother . Haul him ! " The shanty-boater had picked up a heavy brass bolt . " Now then up and over . " With a desperate effort Mr. Dennit hauled the fish on to the deck . For a second it lay there flapping its massive black length . Then the boater was on it . One blow of the bolt and the fish lay still . It was over two feet long . The old man looked at Mr. Dennit with a broad grin . His teeth were stumpy and brown . " Well , Mister , do you think that 's the winner ? " " I should think so . " " How about the five dollars ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said , " Here you are , " and passed over the bills . The thrill had been worth it even if he lost . The old man wadded the bills and stuck them in a crack . " Maybe I ought to get back , " said Mr. Dennit . " No hurry . row you , Mister . I reckon you want to get back without those others getting after you . " " What do you mean ? " cried Mr. Dennit . " The gent with the derringer , or the other two . " " What do you know about them ? " " Lissa heard them talking . Tom , he 's trailed you . " Mr. Dennit froze , solid . " You see , " said Masterman , " I do n't allow no such goings on . We do n't want the sheriff in after us . So you set here . It 's quite a fish , ai n't it ? " Mr. Dennit , for all his worry , could not help feeling gratified as he examined the fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The shanty-boater said , " Now my idea is we have a snort . You come in . " He led the way into the cabin . It was a magpie sort of room . There were pots and pans laid whichways among fishing tackle , a gun across the table , a couple of boots of odd sizes under the bunk , extraordinary scraps of clothing . It had a queer musty smell , of old spirits , tobacco , snuff , and fried fish . The old man lighted a candle set in a lump of clay . The wick shed a feeble smoky glimmer . Outside the window the sun went down behind the hemlocks . A strange stillness settled on the water . The only sound was the old man 's step and his wheezy breathing as he gathered two glasses , stained and brown with fingermarks , and a stone bottle . He tilted the bottle over the glasses . " Consarn ! " It was empty . He paused irresolutely a moment , then his face cleared . He lifted his head and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he too heard the cautious oars . " That 's Tom , " said the old man , suddenly . " He rows a funny way . Right and left . The one over one I call it . " His eye fastened on Mr. Dennit 's . " Tom 's a bodacious kind of boy . He 'd of had me soon if it was n't I had Lissa . He 's ambitious for money . Kind of unmoral . Mister , " he stooped to whisper , " I calculate you 'd better lay hid . You 'd better step in here . Tom 's keen . He 's knife-itchety . I 'll send him for a snort and then I 'll get you out . " Before Mr. Dennit could think , he was seized by the elbow and pushed into the forward room . The door was closed softly after him . He crouched down in almost complete darkness . Mr. Dennit trembled . The oars came closer . Suddenly it occurred to him what a fool he had been . What an utter fool to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a loan . The old fellow spoke fair enough , but if he chose , Mr. Dennit was at his mercy . He had n't even a gun , nothing but a silly penknife . And he did n't know how he could use even that . He tried to pray there in the darkness , but his tongue was dry . He could not even think a prayer . The boat came closer . The oars ceased to splash . There was a faint bump , and then Masterman 's voice . " ' Lo Tom . Glad you came . How about you lending me a drink ? I 'm all out and dry as feathers . " Tom 's voice was low and hoarse . " All right , Benj . Have you . " Shussh ! I 'll come along with you and row myself back . " Mr. Dennit 's heart rose . That sounded fair . Then the hoarse voice asked , " Where 's Lissa ? " " Outside in the woods somewheres , " said the old man . " How should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs a powerful taming . I 'll have to train her down . " The old man chuckled . " You 've bit off a thaw , boy . " " I 've got back teeth , Benj . She 'll learn . " " All right , but we might as well get going . " Mr. Dennit heard a wash of water as the old man stepped into the boat . He crept to the side of the dark room . There was a knothole there , and through it he saw the light from the candle shining through the window directly into the boat . The young man 's face was turned towards him . The young man was a giant in build , but his face was abnormally small and very dark , and the eyes were a light brown , so light that they looked almost white . And while Mr. Dennit looked , the face grinned , and the man said out loud , " How about him ? " " He 's safe , " said the old man shoving off . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the way he watched the wafter . " " How about Lissa ? " " I 've got the key , Tom . There ai n't no axe . She 's queer , I know , but he 's safe . " Safe ! The boat stole away . Safe ! Mr. Dennit began to weep . It was plain now . They were waiting till the Rochester Belle hauled out , and then they would murder him . Safe ! As if in answer , he heard the notes of Saunders ' bugle stealing over the water . Desperately , Mr. Dennit got to his feet and felt his way to the door . It was locked , as he knew , but he threw his weight against it . For all its crazy appearance it was soundly built and his puny strength made scarcely a tremble . He felt his way to the window and battered against the boards with his fists . But they were heavily nailed . He crawled round the room , feeling the walls . There were shelves with jugs and boxes . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the room could he find a hopeful weakness . He went back to the door and tried to examine the lock . A chink of light came through beside it . He wondered if he could whittle past it with his knife . He got the knife out of his pocket and opened the blade , but as he started to work it dropped through his damp fingers . Whimpering to himself he hunted about the floor . It took him five minutes to find it and when he tried whittling again he produced only pitiful scratches . But he worked till his fingers ached . And then he heard a sound of oars coming towards the boat , and he sat down weakly and gave lip . The boat came very quietly . He did not even hear it touch the shanty-boat . But after an instant bare feet patted past the window and entered the cabin . They were so stealthy that he knew his end had come . He tried to think of his wife , Cornelia . He thought instead of Mr. Trumbull and the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the office  --  only now did he realize how he loved its familiar dustiness  --  the ink spots , the ledgers , the rows of red and black figures emerging from the neat point of his pen and always coming right . If he could only get back to his desk , mount his high solid stool once more before he died . A hand tried the door ; but there was no sound of the key . Then a voice , soft and musical , said , " Mister ? " " Yes , " he whispered . " They 've got you , then ? " .. yes .. " I ca n't get in . " " Ca n't you break it down ? " cried Mr. Dennit , springing up in a last desperate hope . " No . Hush , Mister . " There was an interminable silence . " Mister , can you swim ? " " No . " There was a small oath , then more silence , then , " You 'll have to . " " Do n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will you . " He heard her feet slipping out . The silence lasted longer and longer . Then there was a faint splash . Mr. Dennit slid down on his knees facing the door . His breast ached with misery . Then he sprang to his feet . Somebody was knocking on the floor , directly under him . Two little taps . He stood still sweating and trembling . Two taps . " Yes , " he whispered . " Do you hear me ? " The voice was oddly muffled . " Listen , there 's a board loose at the back . I 'm knocking underneath it . You find it . " Then Mr. Dennit began the queerest game he had ever played . It was pitch dark ; and he had to crawl on his hands and knees . He kept bumping off his Lafayette hat against the rear wall , and he was getting cobwebs on his face . And all the time - while he worked towards the tapping , his ears kept stretched for the sound of oars . The taps continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he made a false cast , they came in a triple rap , that somehow sounded impatient and angry to Mr. Dennit . Lord knows , he was doing his best to please . His knees felt as if his trousers and drawers had worn away , he had splinters in his hands , and the blood was throbbing in his forehead . It seemed to him that hours had passed before he heard the voice say , " Right . Lift that one . " Mr. Dennit felt eagerly with the tips of his fingers down one crack , across the end , up the other crack . The board was a short length , and a double width . He could not get his fingers in and was forced to look for his penknife . It was not in his pocket . He realized then that he must have dropped it at the door . He explained to the voice apologetically . " All right , Mister . Go get it . Do n't talk . It 's cold in this water . But leave something on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands and knees to the door and fumbled for the knife . For once luck was with him . At the second swoop of his right hand along the floor , his left hand rested on it . In a moment he was back , and the Lafayette hat was easy to find . He stuck in the blade . The board lifted easily enough . He flung it off . In the well he could just see dimly the girl 's white skin . The face was upturned and he could hear the ripples against her neck as she trod water . " It 's a bother you ca n't swim . Will you be scared to get in with me ? " " I 'd drown rather than stay here . " The girl laughed softly . " I do n't exactly blame you . Now listen , you 've got to promise to get in here and hang on round my middle . And you must n't try to swim . I 'll get us out under the boat . Do you see ? " Mr. Dennit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Yes , Miss . " " All right , climb in . We 've got to hurry . " Mr. Dennit put on his hat and lowered himself into the water . He did n't wonder the girl was in a burry . It was very cold . Inch by inch it crept up to his knees , his waist , and then he had to let himself go . He went down sickeningly . The girl caught him by the armpits . " Do n't be scared , Mister . " She faced him in the water . He could feelher knees chugging the water against his . " Round my waist . And then get in all the air you can into your lungs . " Mr. Dennit gasped . He put out his arms under the water and felt her waist come into them . His hands closed on her back . He gasped again . The girl was as naked as the day she was born . He would have let go , had she not cried , " Now ! " and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she shoved them under with her arms . He felt her legs trailing under his . She was creeping along the bottom of the boat with her hands . The water was over him , round him , in his ears , in his nose . His lungs seemed to swell like balloons . But he clenched his teeth and gave himself up to the water and the powerful thrusts forward of the girl 's arms . And at last , when he knew that he would have to breathe or die he felt them shooting upward through the water , and they broke out into the light from the cabin window , face to face . The girl was looking directly at him . She was shivering . But not half so hard as Mr. Derma . He had to clench his jaws to keep his teeth from chattering . She did not speak , but turned over and taking his hand laid it on her shoulder . Then she struck out for the rear of the boat . There , where the shanty-man had landed Mr. Dennit , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . Mr. Dennit obeyed . In an instant she had left him , to swim round to the side . She gave a strong kick and rose out of the water like a silver fish . Mr. Dennit turned away his eyes , while she slid herself over the gunwale as lithely as an otter . The boat rocked gently in his hands . After a minute , she directed him to pull himself round to the side . There she seized his wrists and told him to kick upward . The boat rocked dangerously , but with her strength added to his he managed to flop in . " Lay still , Mister . " She had taken up her oars and was skimming the boat into the shadow of the shore . Lying on his back Mr. Dennit watched her row . She had slipped on a shirt and a loose pair of trousers , and she stroked with the ease and vigor of a boy . " Miss , " said Mr. Dennit , " it 's hard to thank you enough . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it because I wanted to . " " It was a noble thing for you to do . And I 'd given up hoping . " " You was in a bad way , Mister . " " I 've never been so scared in my life . " " I do n't blame you . Benj and Tom are pretty bad for people like you . " " Would they have murdered me ? " asked Mr. Dennit . " Truly ? " " I do n't know . I reckon they 'd have just passed you through the way you got out , with something tied on your feet . That 's what they 've used it for . " " Miss ? " " Call me Lissa . " " Yes , Miss . I ought to have known better than to bring the money . It 's been awful . And now I 've got to chance that boat again . " " The Rochester Belle ? She pulled out an hour ago . " " What 'll I do ? " " I 'll put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you really ? I 'm terribly grateful . I 'm terribly indebted to you . I 'd like to give you something . " " I do n't want nothing , Mister . Then Tom would find out . Now they 'll find your hat floating in the well and figger you found it and drownded yourself . " All the time they whispered she was oaring the boat swiftly along the set-back . The stars overhead were bright and large . Against them the fringe of tree tops with their May softness of leaves floated dreamily . Suddenly the girl leaned on the oars . " Shh ! " Mr. Dennit held his breath . She slipped in her oars and pulled the skiff against the bank . " Lie still . " Then he heard the dip of other oars coming closer , and a hoarse voice singing throatily . " A roguish youth asked me to wooHeighol The buds wereblowing ! And I was puzzled what to do Heigho ! The buds were blowing ! " The drip of the oars passed close , the voice faded slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash came against it . " There goes Benj and Tom . " The girl waited endless moments ; too long , thought Mr. Dennit . Then she said , " Now we 've got to push . " She bent swiftly to her oars . Mr. Dennit could feel the urgency in her strokes pulsing through the boards . He sat up , his bare head trickling little streams down his neck . The girl said , " So long as I get you into the canal afore the moon rises . . " Mr. Dennit watched the trees sliding past . " Suppose , " he asked suddenly , " suppose Burton or Wallet are waiting . " " They would n't dare hang round here after dark . " The skiff shot suddenly into the open water of the canal , and the girl stroked it west . " We 're about all right . I 'll take you west a mile or so . Maybe we can catch a boat . " Even as she spoke , they heard ahead of them the toot of a brass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the steersman were drowsy . It had no music , but to Mr. Dennit it sounded very HLY MAGAZINE lovely . And in a moment it came again . The girl rested , cocking her head . " They 're going west , about half a mile ahead . " The boat throbbed gently to her deep breathing . But instantly she began rowing , not with the same frantic speed , but with long steady strokes . The moon rose behind them through a veil of mist . As if to greet it , all along the shores small frogs began their peeping . A whip-poor-will lifted its plaintive voice in the track of the towpath . And in a low-hanging tree on the south shore , a tree-toad swelled its throat and trilled as if its heart were aching . Tears came to Mr. Den-nit 's eyes . He did not speak , but he watched the slow moonlight drawing the girl 's features for him to see . She W 41 . R young . Dark hair surrounded her cheeks and fell away over her rough woolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and pointed and dark . In the sounds of the marsh-night , handling her oars so strongly , she was beautiful as a wild creature is beautiful where it grows naturally . But Mr. Dennit , with the citizen 's misplaced instinct , felt sorry for her . He was thinking of Tom 's dark face as he talked to Beni about the girl , his hard eyes , his thin mouth . " I 'm so grateful , " he began . " Do n't , " she said . " I did it because I want to . " " But you do n't want to live with those awful men ! " " I might as well . I like the swamp . " " Yes , but . " She seemed to divine his thought . " I like Tom . He 's hard-bitted , to you , Mister . I do n't deny it . But he 's young . And he 's powerful here . " " But , " cried Mr. Dennit , " he 'll treat you badly . He might beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A man has to break loose now and again . I guess I can watch out for myself , Mister . " " I could take you back with me . Find you a home , " said Mr. Dennit desperately . " I do n't want a home . I 'll find my own , that is. - Her voice hardened . " Now you tend to yourself , Mister . Do n't bother about me . " Mr. Dennit felt humiliated . " I want to do something for you . " " I 'm grateful . But there 's noth-ing : , " You 're one of them , I suppose , " Mr. Dennit muttered . " Yes . I am . What difference ? " " Why did you get me out ? " She lowered her eyes . She might have been blushing . After a short hesitation , she said , " You see , Mister , me and Tom is getting married to-morrow . And I guess I 've got a kind of funny streak into me . I could n't abear thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beni leaves us . " She did not look at him . But Mr. Dennit felt his humiliation completed . He lowered his face . " You must pardon me , Miss . I 'm an inexperienced man . I did n't intend anything against your young man . And I made an awful mess of everything , or I would n't have given you all this trouble . " As she made no reply , he lifted his eyes . She was smiling . " I do n't mind , Mister . I 'm proud to have done it , even to getting the better of Torn and Benj . I never seen nothing since I was born as brave as you getting down into that hole with a girl , and you could n't swim . " Mr. Dennit was glad his back was to the moon . He was flushing alI over . " I was just plain scared . I 'd have gone with anybody then . " She laughed aloud . Round the bend ahead , they heard a man call from the boat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of them shanty-boater girls . " " Well , lay into that black mule . This stretch makes a man uneasy . " The skiff rounded the bend . Just in front , a freight boat was creeping along . They could see the figure of the steersman outlined in black against the glow of the how lantern . At the same instant the man heard the oars . He turned at them . " Hey there ! " Mr. Dennit raised his hand . " Hello ! Will you take a passen-ger ? " " Who the hell are you ? " " Atwater Dennit . I got left behind by my packet . " The man swore . " Did you hear that , Bill ? " he yelled at the driver . The mules stopped , and the heavy old boat barged slowly forward with lessening way . " Come up where I can look at you , " directed the boater . The girl rowed into the zone of the bow lantern . " By eternal nation ! It is him . Sure you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cargo out of Rome . Me , I 'm Vince Tucker . " Mr. Dennit caught the low rail . He turned to the girl . " I 'll say just once more how grateful I am . " " Do n't , Mister . Good-night . " " Good-night . " The skiff slid into darkness . Mr. Dennit went aft to confront the amazed boater . " How 'd you come to be left here , Mr. Dennit ? " " I went fishing . " A gaping hole of amazement fringed with yellow teeth opened in the steersman 's beard . " But who 's the girl ? How 'd you find her ? " Mr. Dennit said , " She very kindly put me on this boat . " " I seen that , " said the boater , and he swore to himself . " All right , you can go down . We 'll be in Syracuse after sun-up . " He waited until Mr. Dennit had vanished into the small cabin . " George , " he called softly as the mules took up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " " Yeanh . " " George , did you see that girl ? " " Yeanh ? One of them shanty women . They 're a burn scrub for a man like you and me , I 've heard . " " But George , did n't you see her good ? " " Oh , shut up ! I seen her . Do n't bother a man that 's sleepy . " " By God , she was a pretty piece , " the steersman said to himself . " I wonder how that clerk got across her , and what he was doing with her . Fishing ? Hell ! " But Mr. Dennit never told . Not even after he had delivered his money to Mr. Jones . It was his great adventure , and he preferred to keep it to himself .
