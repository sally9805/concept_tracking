Petition &; Privilege <P> Why Louisiana will not be an exhibitor at Chicago 's " Century of Progress " Fair this summer was last week explained to an Alexandria , La. audience by Arch Johnson of the World 's Fair staff , as follows : <P> " Because the late Mayor Anton Cermak of Chicago voted against seating the delegation of Senator Huey P. Long at the Democratic National Convention . . . . When Governor Allen was appealed to , he also forbade the sending of the exhibit to Chicago . " <P> Of far more consequence last week to the chunky , rumple-headed Louisiana " Kingfish " than keeping his State out of the Century of Progress was the matter of keeping himself in the U. S. Senate . To Vice President Garner 24 Louisiana citizens dispatched a sizzling petition calling for the ousting of Senator Long on eleven charges . The Vice President turned the petition over to the Senate which whisked it temporarily out of sight to a committee . Its chief sponsor was John Milliken Parker , onetime ( 1920-24 ) Governor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Parker &; petitioners volunteered to furnish the Senate with evidence to prove that Huey P.

His black record is nationally known . Psychiatrists have stated in my presence that he is a dangerous paranoiac . . . . The Senate should have him permanently incarcerated in Washington . . . . He is the greatest menace to American decency and civilization . " <P> The petition 's reference to a Federal investigation of Huey Long 's income started press stories that the Senator might soon be prosecuted by the Treasury on charges of tax evasion . Senate wiseacres concluded that the widening rift between Senator Long and President Roosevelt is attributable to this tax matter , held by the Administration like a club over the Louisianian 's unruly head .
