txt As the statesmen have been meeting at Geneva , to discuss a United State , s o/ Europe and to fix the date for the World Disarmament Conference , big movements and big changes are afoot , In drawing up a survey 01 Europe 's prospects for the year 1931 , Mr. Iluddleston has endeavored to elimtnate the more extreme views of pestintsts and optimists alike and to strike a fair balance , showing that while conditions are unquestionably critical , the movement /or unity and caaperation is gaining strength . Previous articles on this subject appeared Jan. 19 , 27 and 28 , Nationalities were multiplied and intensified by the war , There is a curious contrast between the underlying ideas of the nineteenth and of the twentieth centuries In Europe , The object of one was to simplify , apparently the result of the other is to conmlieate . The former trend was toward larger and fewer nations . The latter trend was toward smaller and more numerous nations . Self-determination of peoples is certainly to be defended , but it should not be pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welded together by the union of Croats , Greece partially fulfilled its ambition . Latvia , Estonia and Lithuania attained independence . But in the formation of new nations , purely ethnic considerations were not enough , Economic unity had to be taken into account , Strategic needs Could not be disregarded , Even had the new map of Europe been drawn with far more foresight , it would have been impossible to avoid some measure of injustice ; the injustice had to be on one side or the other , Thus there are minorities in almost every country , It would have been well had these minorities settled down and accepted their fate , But they do not always show a disposition to accommodate themselves to the life of the country to which they have been allotted , and their restlessness Is encouraged by the parent nations , which hope to recover them . Their attitude provokes retaliation , and it is probably true that the countries in which they find themselves , moved by resentment andsin some cases by fear , do not always treat them wisely . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to diminish sufficiently in a few years to permit a general disarmament . It is not acknowledged that the shake-up is final . Therefore it is natural that the nations should remain on the qui vive and refuse to surrender their arms . Need for Arms Reduction The problem of disarmament is not easy to solve , Yet it is something that exists even as a problem . There have , of course , been earlier attempts at disarmament ; but never before hoc the necessity of a substantial reduction been so acutely felt . it %ea : , plainly seen in 1919 that the peace of Europe depended on such a reduction . It was stated in the treaties that one of the main tasks of the League would be to prepare such reduction . The piling up of arms was one of the causes of war ; and the years before 1014 were described as n period of armed peace . It is already much that there should be a real desire to find some method of relieving Europe of a dangerous burden , The recognition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Individual nations ; that in this matter full sovereignty is not ultimately possible ; that the old national autonomy which permitted Unlimited armaments must go ; that some scheme must be devised by which there will be a simultaneous reduction by universal agreement  --  the recognition of these things is a proof of an unprecedented advance . But how to translate this ideology Into practice while there is still an exacerbation of nationalisms is a question which is not yet answered , There have been many checks during the past 10 years , but these checks have not been accepted as final . It has been resolved to continue the search for a solution until a solution is found , The preparatory commission of disarmament has completed its task and a conference is now to be called . It is facile to say that there has been procrastination ; it is facile to criticize the timid suggestions that have Yet to be accepted and acted upon . Nevertheless the skeptics have been routed by what Is , after all , the most notable international performance of 1030 . The League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiments against leaving peoples unprotected against an invader , " Give us security first and we will disarm , " Was the thesis of many nations , And their conception of security was either the formation of an international army which would defend them , or , better still , specific pledges on the part of their neighbors of assistance in case ' of need , In other words , there was to be no disarmament , but only a displacement of armaments , If A consented to reduce its army , it would be because it could count on an equivalent number of Men and munitions from B. Since an International army Is , for the time being , out of the question , and since each nation feels that it has quite enough to do to provide for Its own needs without providing for the needs of others , this form of security was , In the nature of the case , ruled out . It requires some moral courage in these circumstances for the powers to proceed to draw up even the framework of a disarmament scheme , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of the League , of the Loearno pacts , of the Kellogg pact , anti of facilities for arbitration , necessarily marshals public opinion on the side of a peaceful nation . It is to be regretted that there has been no real agreement on trained reserves , The question has been virtually brushed aside . and yet it is Important , It brings up the whole matter of conscription , Various European nations compel the whole of their man power to pass through a period of military training . Others adopt the system of long-service voluntary enlistments , Between these two types of armies there is no common measure . Arms Controversy There are experts who hold that a long-service voluntary army must be more efficient than a conscript army , and would serve as the nucleus of a Much greater army that could be quickly enrolled and trained . But the tuitions with conscript armies are disinclined to abandon them , because by traditleon they believe that every MU zen should be inrp , nt ( I to take hi , share M the defame of his ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has been imposed a Hinttecl long-service voluntary aunt The countries , such as Fiance , winch has , . conscript alone : , declare , , oiri ? v , hai contradictorily that ' they will not abandon thir own methods , but that the ? email method offers c. menace They compelled Germany to mint a professional army , and then complained that a professional aim 1 , dangerous .

Either there must be disarmament by general consent , of there will be a race in armament : , such as led to the war . The great virtue of the document drawn up by the commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactory ; but disarmament is no longer a vague expression , a word tossed into the air . It has become a definite plan , It exists black upon white , with commas and full Mom But indeed it has more than the mere merit of existing ; it is , on the whole , better than was hoped . Budgetary limitation of material has been adopted . An organization of control has been accepted . The exchange of information , which may be the preliminary to a consultative pact , has been admitted . In short , though frontiers are still being fortified , and European nations wrangle over naval parity , and more money is being spent on the maintenance of national forces than in 1013 , yet not only the notion , but the practical plan of disarmament , has come into being , and public opinion will press for its realization . The plan will doubtless be modified ; it will undoubtedly be the subject of arduous discussion ; but at last a forward step has been taken , and European countries , like non-European countries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
