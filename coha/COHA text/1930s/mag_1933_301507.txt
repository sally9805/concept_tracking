All over the Fatherland solemn little groups of school children paced the streets importantly one day last week , chanting at grown ups " Ja , ja ja ! Vote Ja ! Ja , ja , ja ! Vote Ja ! " <P> Blind men ran their fingers over a Nazi hump- &-bump; manifesto in Braille which keynoted " Vote Ja ! " <P> Gaudy prostitutes from Berlin 's West End hotels and night clubs , who are rarely seen on the streets by daylight , piled out of bed and trudged sleepily to the polls , minced home again wearing little buttons with the legend " Ja . " <P> Nazi war veterans in wheel chairs displayed the challenging placard : " German , hast thou voted Ja ? If not , our sacrifice was in vain ! " <P> In remote seaports Germans piled aboard steamers to register with the captains their " Ja . " <P> In Berlin nearly every kiosk blossomed with a poster of Der Marschall und der Gefreite . Onetime Gefreite ( lance-corporal ) Adolf Hitler was shown in Nazi uniform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Together they appealed to all Germany in giant capitals to KAMPFEN MIT UNS FUR FRIEDEN UND GLEICHBERECHTIGUNG ! ( " Battle with us for peace and equality ! " ) . The great plebiscite decreed by Chancellor Hitler to vindicate his withdrawal of Germany from the Disarmament Conference and resignation from the League of Nations ( TIME , Oct. 23 et seq. ) was on . Adolf Hitler , born an Austrian , was about to make good his audacious boast when summoned before the German Supreme Court three years ago ( TIME , Oct. 6 , 1930 ) . Asked by the Court , " Are you plotting a revolution ? " , he snarled , " Nein ! " we are merely planning an intellectual eruption of the German people by peaceful means . . . . Within three years 35,000,000 of the 40,000,000 German voters will support us . . . . Heads will roll in the sand ! " <P> Last spring in the last election more than 20,000,000 Germans voted against Hitlerism , though Adolf Hitler was then Chancellor and had put on a terrific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure of a real " intellectual eruption " last week - an utter blasting of Nazidom 's foes-the Chancellor and his chief henchmen have been shouting themselves hoarse for weeks , roaring up and down Germany in Herr Hitler 's big private plane , often piloted by the bullnecked , hot-eyed No. 2 Nazi , General Hermann Wilhelm Goring , Premier of Prussia and a War ace ( see cut ) . To ensure victory other steps were also taken-or at least a great many Germans seemed to think so. * <P> Nazi wrath knew no bounds when His Eminence Michael Cardinal von Faulhaber , Archbishop of Munich , exhorted German Catholics last week to vote " according to your conscience . " Nazis stormed that the Cardinal should have said " Vote Ja ! " In a speech of passionate denunciation General Goring spoke of " black moles " ( priests ) as little better than " Red rats " ( Socialists ) - despite the fact that Chancellor Hitler is nominally a Catholic .                  @ @ @
