txt Early yesterday . morning we were very low-spirited vi:hen we saw the fog shut out the sunlight in Halifax , and thought we : should again be delayed in arriving at New York . Since Reykjavik we have lived for nothing but this wonderful city . As for me , I had planned for the flight for two years , but I did not tell Zimmer ' and Franz and Fritz until we reached Iceland , because I did not wish the authorities to find out and to stop our flight . But tonight what I have dreamed of for a lifetime is accomplished . We had a splendid trip yesterday , the best of the crossing , except for two hours of fog off the Nova Scotia coast . And then when we saw New York from the air , the immense buildings , the thousands of tiny dots that thronged the streets , the busy waterways , it was what we call in the old country , wunderbar . I followed the police plane down and touched the water just off what they told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though there were many boats in the harbor . and I had to be careful not to let the old plane strike any driftwood , which is very dangerous to a seaplane . But we are here . And , now we are here , I want to say how well old Fritz stuck at that key in the after cockpit and to tell you how faithfully Franz Hack climbed up each hour of flight to look at the thundering motors , B. M. W.-6 we call them , 500-horsepower motors built by the Bavarian Motor Works . They are new , but the plane itself is the same old . Dornier-Wal that Amundsen and Courtney used . Edward Zimmer , one of my students at the Deutsches Verkehrs Fliegerschule , was at the stick with me , and when I was ' navigating Zimmer kept us on the course . Much Improvising Done on the Plane . Because the plane is old , we had to do a lot of what you call . improvising before we started . It is not a comfortable plane to he in a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchor and the towing lines and all such gear as that . And then , in the pilot 's cockpit , Zimmer and I sat side by side . I made all the landings and took the stick at the takeoffs , too , because there is only one throttle , and it is on my side . Back of the pilot 's cockpit was a little place where I kept my navigating gear ? the navigating cockpit we call it , though it is closed over and I had to use the pilot 's cockpit to take my sights . I took along a bubble sextant , lots of charts  --  but not enough , as I found out  --  and four compasses . Three of them were magnetic and one was an earth inductor compass , which behaved very well . Between the navigator 's cockpit and , the radio cockpit , further aft in the hull , is the tank room , where we kept the gasoline . We could only crawl through there , so we rigged up some wires and a carrier so that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the plane . Fritz had his sending and receiving gear back there , a wind-driven generator for the sending set and an auxiliary petrol-driven generator . Franz Hack , Our mechanic , spent his time in the tank room or in helping Fritz , and every hour , as I have said , he would climb up to the great motors and look them over . Aides Unaware of Momentous Venture . We trained for the flight by a preliminary three-day trip to Stockholm . Finland , and other places in the Baltic . But ? of course Zimmer and the others did n't know we were going through other than routine training then , for the school sponsors every year long-distance flights as a part of its instruction . Zimmer is a student at my school and the other two are , like me , a part of its staff . You see , I did n't want the authorities to know , because they would have stopped me because of the risk and other things , and so I just went . One must have some daring if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ List , our little flying village on the Isle of Sylt , in the North Sea , last Monday morning  --  just nine days ago . I can hardly yet believe it ; it seems more like months . In forty-seven hours of flying we have sailed over 4,000 nautical miles : over ice and angry waters , over Greenland and those other countries I had only read about , and now at last we are here , and it is warm again , almost too warm . When we left Sylt we shot along over the North Sea with pretty fair weather conditions and a strong tail wind which made that the quickest lap of our journey , about 700 miles in six and a half hours . We had often hopped over to the Faroe Islands , and I knew a little cove there called Transesvaag , where we had stored some petrol . It was raining very , very hard when we came there , so there was nothing we could do but just set the plane down on the water , cover up the motors as best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop . We stayed there over night and on Tuesday we took off for Reykjavik . We started in clear weather , but we had not gotten far before we ran into a mighty fog bank lying before us and going up very high . It is strange flying into fog . At first , just for a moment , there is always an uncomfortable feeling , but then one gets used to it . We flew through the fog for hours , and Fritz kept getting messages from ships and stations reporting a head wind . I always want to get down when there is a head wind , for the wind is usually not so strong near the sea . So we came very low and could see that the sea was very rough , but there was no head wind . All the way to Iceland we kept getting messages reporting head winds and we had a tail wind all the way . About six hours we were in the fog and then suddenly all was clear and we saw the island before us . Great white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' rocky coast , and inland we saw the foaming hot springs and the steam from the boiling water . The clouds of steam were yellow and white ; the yellow , I suppose , came from the sulphur springs . Just before we got to Reykjavik we swooped down into the lips of a crater and above a beautiful lake deep in the crater . We had a very kind reception in Iceland , and it was good to sleep in fine beds at a good hotel . The Meteor , a German surveying ship , was in port , and her first officer was an old Kamerad of mine in the German Navy . She had just come from Greenland and gave us some valuable information on weather conditions . At Reykjavik I told the others about how I wished to go to the United States , to the State of New York , and , oh , they were so happy at the idea . It had never entered their heads . Storm Strikes Them After Leaving Iceland . Wednesday it rained fearfully and there was a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port . And on Thursday we spent the day in refueling and in getting ready for the long leg to Greenland . Just as before , it was splendid weather when we left Iceland , but before an hour we ran into a storm . And it kept up almost the whole way . For seven hours it blew hard from the north , about forty miles an hour , I think . And the air was bumpy so ? that piloting was hard . It rained hard , too , and there was mist so that we could not see far and had to fly close to the surface of the water . And the sea was very rough , and we did not like to look upon it . So we were all relieved , I think , when we first sighted the pans of floating ice . For the sea is seldom rough in an ice field , the ice breaks the force of the wind and the water does not " kick up " so much . After ten hours we saw Greenland 's barren coast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an icy sea ; it was barren and awful , though grand . We could see no living creature anywhere ; nothing but ice and sea and rock . The whole centre of the island is ' a great glacier and from the glacier rivers of ice poured down the steep slopes into deep fjords . Stolid Greenland Eskimos Were Amazed . The old Dornier-Wal , rain-soaked , but still bumping along , rounded Cape Farewell in what should have been for us , about sunset , but because we had been flying with the sun , it was still early afternoon in Greenland . We flew slowly over the coast because I wanted to see Julienahhab and Friedershavn , where I had sent some petrol in case of an emergency landing . But they were so little and the huts of the Eskimos so small we could scarcely see them . Then we landed in Ivitgut in the Greenland afternoon , and the Eskimos were stolidly amazed . We had a splendid reception from the manager of the creolite factory , the only one of its kind in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in real beds : And we had not expected that in Greenland . Saturday morning at 8 o'clock as we prepared to leave it was very fine weather at Ivitgut , though the town had just had a report from a steamer which was trying to get in the fjord and could n't find the entrance because of fog . We took off , though , and then we had our only accident , and we were lucky , very lucky , that it was n't worse . Just as the plane lifted from the fjord , the propeller for our driven radio generator , a small propeller , driven by the slip stream , broke to pieces , " exploded " really , for it made an awful noise and smashed all to bits . It wrecked the generator , but fortunately it did n't do any harm at all to the tail of the plane or to our elevating rudders . We came down again , saw we could n't do anything about the generator , and decided to make the hop anyhow . ? We had the petrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it had . to be cranked by hand each time we started it . And it could n't be kept going long because it became too hot . We got off all right the second time , but soon ran into the fog the steamer had reported . We climbed and climbed and got over the fog . Then we could n't use our driftmeter , and so I got out the bubble sextant , wnue Zinimer took the stick and took some shots of the sun . They were not very accurate because I could n't get a true horizon on account of the fog and the air was so bumpy that the artificial horizon afforded by the bubble in the sextant was n't very good , either . But they were better than nothing and served to show us our approximate positions . The radio did n't help us much in navigation ; we got no bearings at all , though we were in touch with Ivitgut and Resolution Island . The noise of the motors was so terrific that every time Fritz Albrecht tried to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after-motor , and that is not so good , you know , in a long flight . We managed to stay above the fog for a time and the sun shone , but then clouds came above us and the fog below and we were shut in a world alone . We glided down toward the water and skimmed along above the wave tops , so close that we had to reel in some of the radio antenna . At about ten feet we sped along for almost six hours , until suddenly we saw ahead of us icebergs , blue-green and huge . Then we knew we were near land and soon we found it . The rugged cliffs of Labrador rose sheer from the sea before us , great and gruff and grim , but they seemed glorious to us . " Thank God , we are over to America , " we said , and had a drink of brandy around to celebrate it . " But we do n't know where we are , even if we are here , " was our second thought , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . We flew right over Gready Island and saw the masts of the radio station there , and that was a landmark and we knew we were not far from Cartwright . Only when we flew over him could we get the operator at Gready ; we had been trying for hours , and the only time we stirred him his fist was so bad Fritz could n't copy it . At Cartwright we were wonderfully taken care of by the Hudson 's Bay Company factors . When we first landed we thought we had struck a band of robbers , for all about us swarmed boys and men with long beards . We found out they were only college lads from America and working at Cartwright for Dr. Grenfell , whom they call the patron saint of Labrador . We left Labrador Sunday morning at 7 o'clock , skirted the Labrador coast and tried to find Greenley Isle . I had long wanted to see that , but we lost it in the fog . So then , despite a ten-degree error in our compass off Newfoundland , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions in Halifax so bad , we landed at Queensport , and I guess you know the rest . It is good to be here , and now , all I want is sleep for a long , long time .
