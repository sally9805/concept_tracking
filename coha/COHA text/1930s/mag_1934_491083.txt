A NORMAL day in the White House varies a little with the administration . The first stir comes sometime after seven , when the doors to the residential quarters are opened to permit the entry of the staff . The President and his wife will EDITED BY WESLEY STOUT emerge from their rooms , as a rule , about eight o'clock . Most of them have breakfasted at 8:00 or 8:30 , though some have eaten as late as nine . If there are house guests , they will have been told the night before of the hour of breakfast and that they are expected to join their hosts in the upper corridor at that hour . Upon meeting they descend to the main floor , where breakfast may be served in any of the dining rooms or , as with the Hoovers , on the south porch . Only the Coolidges , in my time , did not breakfast with their guests  --  they eating this meal in the President 's dressing room with the company of two or three dogs , to whom they fed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their rooms or in one of the dining rooms , as they chose . In the Harrison Administration , the family and any guests gathered in the library for morning prayers after breakfast . How common this was previously . I do not know , but it has not been true since . The breakfast menu lies somewhere between the old-fashioned morning meal of Americans and the fruit and toast of some moderns . There is fruit and cereal , bacon , sausage or ham and eggs  --  with hash or chipped beef scrambled in eggs sometimes substituted for bacon or ham  --  hot bread , toast or cold bread , white or brown , as the tastes of the family may dictate . Jelly and marmalade always are on the table . Only in the Taft Administration were heavy meats common to the breakfast table . Mr. Taft 's breakfast must include a steak . He ate largely of other foods and liked to sit at table long after the others had left , reading the papers and munching toast spread with guava jelly or marmalade . Coffee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his coffee to the heavy cream used by everyone else . Breakfast over , it is a scramble for the next hnlf hour . Many times there are overnight guests who are leaving after this meal . They must say their good-bys , return to their rooms to pack , and be whisked off to the station in a White House car . House guests who remain over are left to their own resources . They may go shopping , sight-seeing , relax in their rooms or write letters . The opportunity of writing letters on White House stationery is one that few neglect . The President goes from the breakfast table to his office , whether , as in the old days , to the suite in the east end of the second floor of the White House itself , or , since Roosevelt 's time , to the Executive Office Building . There are two routes to the latter , the overland and the subway  --  so described by their first occupant , T. R. The overland leads via the state dining room , over the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly into the Executive Offices . The subway , or bad-weather , route travels by elevator or stairs to the lower floor , down the corridor past the kitchen and under the west terrace . Two Presidents ' wives have made a practice of walking to the office with their husbands  --  the second Mrs. Wilson and Mrs. Hoover . The Wilsons usually strolled by the overland route , and she would part with the President on the winding stairs . As they were , at this point , out of the view of even the secret-service man on duty , the staff inferred that they kissed on parting . The Hoovers used each route impartially and Mrs. Hoover went right to the office door  --  frequently into the office to remain awhile . The Hoovers had many guests , the President worked incessantly , and this often was the only opportunity Mrs. Hoover had during the day of speaking to him of personal matters . Busy Mornings for the First Lady AT THIS time the First Lady turns to her mail . Regardless of the personality of the woman or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy . Usually her secretary has gone over it first , sifting out the known personal messages for delivery unopened , disposing of the remainder according to her judgment . Some of it goes direct to the wastebasket . The exception to this rule was Mrs. Hoover , who , though she had two or three secretaries , delegated no part of her mail , opening it herself , distributing it among them and indicating the disposition . These women secretaries are officed in the White House , and they confer with the First Lady as much as the President 's secretaries do with him . Especially in the social season , when Mrs. Hoover used a third secretary , is the wife 's staff as busy as the husband 's . Mrs. Hoover held regular Cabinet meetings before and after each important dinner and reception , her Cabinet consisting of the secretaries , the Army and Navy aides attached to the White House , and the chief usher . Here we threshed out details of parties to come and criticized details of parties done . The President 's wife will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff and other Government employes on matters relating directly or indirectly to the house , and for those visitors to Washington who bear letters from close personal or political friends . It is customary to ask such visitors in for five or ten minutes . Mrs. Hoover used to save some part of her mornings for her Girl Scout friends . Or it is possible that , as the tourists are winding through the public rooms , the First Lady will be closeted with her dressmakers above ; fittings always are arranged for the morning . The President will remain in his office all morning , with rare exceptions . Lunch will vary from 1 : 00 to 1:30 with administrations . Whatever the hour , the President usually returns promptly , neither early nor late . Lunch was purely a family meal , with business eschewed , down to Theodore Roosevelt 's time . His table rarely was without extra plates , and the meal hour was an open forum for business , politics , literature , sport or whatever the company suggested . Taft occasionally had a guest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ; but with the coming of the Hoovers , breakfast as well as lunch and dinner became semipublic meals . Business and politics were discussed steadily . When he returns from his office , the President will meet other members of the family and any guests in the Red Room , the guests gathering there in advance . They proceed to the dining room , the President leading with the ranking woman guest , who is seated at his right . However he and his wife may try to make these meals as informal as they would be in private life , they differ little from state functions except in numbers and outward aspects . It seems quite impossible to accomplish an easy informality in the White House ; it is the shadow of the office . The lunch menu always is complete , but elaborate only on very special occasions . The meal will begin with a soup or fruit cup , according to the season , followed by a meat course , several vegetables , a salad and dessert . Cheese is served with the salad at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always are passed at the end . Some serve coffee for lunch , others do not . Cigars and cigarettes are passed to the men with the coffee to be consumed in another room ; but at this writing-1931 ? cigarettes , as yet , have not been passed to the ladies . Once or twice , women have been bold enough to ask for cigarettes and have been given them . Confirmed smokers are more apt to bring their own and steal off to their room or a quiet corner for a puff after meals . Even this is uncommon . The only smoking I have seen done at the table was on a few occasions when only men were present , and the suggestion came , of course , from the President . Even when the company is all male , they retire usually to one of the parlors or to the President 's study for smoking . The end of the meal is signaled by the President rising . He may join the others briefly in another room before going back to his office . Coolidge invariably took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President joins them , the others usually retire to the living-room floor for a few minutes ' talk before breaking up . House guests now may go shopping , go to sleep , take up their correspondence on White House stationery where they left off , or just sit . The President commonly will return from his office around five or six o'clock to relax before joining the others for dinner . Even this time is broken into ; Hoover often gave it to appointments with special visitors whose presence it . was desired to keep from the newspapers . Callers who see him in his office must run the gantlet of the newspapermen , but no reporters watch the house doors . Secrecy frequently is essential for reasons of public policy , and it implies nothing beneath the dignity of the White House . Personally , I have arranged for private mail boxes under assumed names for two of the Presidents in my time as chief usher . Teatime at the White House T HE ladies of the White House set aside the late afternoon from 4:30 to 6:00 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls on coming to Washington or on leaving it are given private audiences of ten minutes . A White House aide always is present to make formal introductions . Small teas are frequent in the season . Some - wives have limited their teas to special guests ; others , like Mrs. Hoover , opened them to visitors known to them only through a letter of introduction from some officeholder . Such letters pour in on the social secretaries , and not all can be honored . It is so gratifying to be able to murmur , " I must hurry away , as I have an appointment at the White House . " The implication is that the White House is eager to see the lady ; much more often it is the lady who is eager . Mrs. Hoover introduced the innovation of serving orangeade as well as tea in the summer months . Lawn parties are held at this time of day . If and when these various functions are ended , it is a good time for a motor ride . It has been common in more recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this lull before dinner in riding through Potomac or Rock Creek Park . Many of the Presidents have spent the predinner hour in exercise . Roosevelt always did . Harrison , McKinley and Coolidge walked . The latter might walk out one gate and in the other , but he called it a walk . Cleveland and Wilson rode at this hour ; one in a surrey behind a spanking team , the other in an open car . Taft and Harding left the office regularly in midafternoon to play golf until dinner . Wilson , though a golfer , did not play as often and preferred the early morning . Hoover alone took no exercise , unless you count his pre-breakfast medicine-ball sessions , and these were a joke so far as exercise was concerned . He talked shop all the time and invited only players willing and eager to talk shop with him . All work and no play , and this in an environment where most occupants have taken it easy . Until the war came , Wilson worked only a small part of the day . Coolidge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known . Others fell somewhere between the Coolidge and Hoover extremes . Dinner at the White House has fluctuated between 7:00 , 7:30 and 8:00 , with , again , the Coolidges at one extreme , the Hoovers at the other . In each case they were continuing the practice of their private lives . The Coolidges had lived unfashionably , the Hoovers fashionably , before coining to the White House . State dinners are set for eight o'clock , irrespective of the administration . Dinner guests gather in the Red Room , are introduced to one another , shown their place at the table on a plot , if there are many of them , assigned a dinner partner , then arranged in a semicircle from right to left , according to rank , before the President and his wife enter . The latter pass down the line , greeting the company just as in the most formal function . The President then precedes the company , escorting the lady who is to sit at his right . The First Lady follows on the arm of the ranking man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only exception that I recall to this rule was Mrs , Cleveland , who , even at state dinners , waited until all others had left the parlor , then brought up at the end of the line with her escort . When the President Dines in State rr HE President and his wife sit opposite each other . 1 The honor position for women is to the right , then the left of the President ; for men , to the right , then the left of the wife , and so on until the groups meet . Again there has been one exception . The invalid Mrs. McKinley always sat next to her devoted husband , at his right hand . A momentary exception occurred at the dinner to the King and Queen of Siam . On this occasion the State Department overruled the good American custom in favor of European court precedent , to the irritation of all of us . The King was placed at Mr. Hoover 's right , the Queen at his left , with Mrs. Hoover at the right hand of the King . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the American rule was quite as good as the European . The menu for a state dinner and a normal one are little different . There will be a few extra touches to the decorations and service for the former , but the quality of the food and the number of courses will be the same  --  good American food , and enough of it in either ease . Fortunately , the State Department ha-s no authority over the menus , or we might have a lot of Asiatic or European dishes . Dinner ended , the men retire to one room , where coffee and tobacco are served , the women to another , where the tobacco is omitted . When the party is a large one , there usually is music in the East Room by invited artists , for which extra guests often are invited in  --  the East Room seating 300 to 400 comfortably . Large or small , the affair ends with the President and wife taking their leave and retiring to their private apartments , while the ushers and aides see that the guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to bed at ten o'clock , the convivial Hardings not before midnight . No others retired so early as the Coolidges , none so late as the Hardings . When the family retires , they signal the fact by pushing an electric button . At ? this signal the lights are extinguished , and the doors  --  including the doors to the presidential bedchambers  --  are closed and locked . The President may not lock his door , but he would not be permitted to leave it open if he wished . A guard makes regular rounds in the corridors through the night , reporting each half hour by signal buttons , one of which is located just outside the door of the presidential chambers . If the guard were to find an open door . he would investigate at once . When Roosevelt rang the bell for lights out , it was his custom to wait for the coming of an usher and to call a cheery goad night . The others have rung and vanished , but in any case it is a welcomed signal , for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted and calm prevails under the roof for the next seven or eight hours . Whenever the President or his wife leaves the private apartments , the signal is passed through the house . Neither is permitted to operate the elevator . Though Presidents are not forbidden to do this or that. , they are educated at the beginning of their terms that certain precautions are essential to their own safety and comfort . How a Chief Executive is Protected WHENWHEN the elevator starts , the attendant signals the usher 's room , ringing three times if the President is aboard , one for the wife . The ushers , secret-service and police details take their stations on the main floor . Should the President or his wife continue to the basement floor , the signals are repeated there . If the President turns toward the Executive Offices , the three-bells signal is repeated to the offices ; and when he leaves there to return to the house , the signal is reversed . Whenever and wherever he moves outside his apartments , his steps are dogged . Most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all ; but he recognized it as a " necessary evil , " in his own words , and came , like Roosevelt and Hoover , to submit philosophically . Taft and Harding showed their irritation at times . Coolidge liked to beat the system . It was one of his practical jokes to steal out of his bedroom and down the stairs unobserved , if he could . The greater the dismay of the staff , the more his pleasure . Simplicity is the rule of the house . Though there is a system which goes on while Presidents come and go , its motive is efficiency , and there is no pomp and ceremony in the European-court sense . All is easy and sensible , within the limitations fixed by circumstances . The best of order , naturally , is maintained and all are held to strict accountability for their duties . Some wives have taken more interest in the household than others , and one President has reveled in domestic details . Coolidge made it his business to know everything that was going on ; matters too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the men have taken the household machinery for granted . Roosevelt and Hoover knew nothing and cared less about such matters . Hoover , in fact , was utterly oblivious . The President and his family come into direct contact with the attendants constantly , and no form is observed . The passing salutation of the day serves . The cordiality may vary with the individual and the mood , but any attendant feels free to address the President or his wife at any proper time in the normal way of human beings . It is not uncommon to see a President talking with the lowliest employe . This is a pleasant condition and in marked contrast to the ways of Buckingham Palace as I observed them when accompanying President Wilson to London . The very solemn and efficient butler who served the table at which three of us ate could not conceal his amazement at seeing the President talking freely with us . He told us that in the six years he had been in the royal service , the King and Queen had never spoken to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should come face to face with them in a passageway . In that case , he said , he would come stiffly to attention , then bow low and murmur , " Your Majesties . " Tho King or Queen might nod in acknowledgment , or they might ignore him . We congratulated ourselves that we were serving a republic . The Domestic Staff There are many of us , but enough work for all . The Chief Usher has two assistants . A housekeeper heads the domestic staff . Mrs. Hoover had a personal maid and two second maids , Mr. Hoover a valet . On the front door are four Negro doormen , and there are four butlers in regular service . One head cook , three assistants and a dishwasher handle the kitchen . Two men take care of the basement floor , one the main floor and four men the living-room floor . There are two maids on this floor as well , and two other maids on general work . In the ' basement are a storekeeper , an engineer , three firemen , an electrician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floors . There also are a messenger , a man who attends to the dogs , and one who runs the check room at the public entrance , Some ten in all are attached to the social room , whose duties are principally concerned with the White House itself . Some twenty aides are assigned to the house , two of whom have offices here and are supposed to be found here daily . The State Department also details a social aide . The police force numbers fifty-six in all , with seven always on duty in the house . This is exclusive of the Secret Service , one or two of whom always are on duty . The garden force numbers about ten , and there is a staff of chauffeurs . For large dinners and receptions , extra waiters , kitchen help and checkroom hands are brought in . The Marine Band always plays at such affairs , and a detail of twelve to fifteen private soldiers in dress uniform is stationed about the doorways . A House With No Servant Problem The employes continue from one administration to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and valets . The only wholesale sweep was on Cleveland 's return in 1893 , when I was one of a very few to escape the ax . Other than then , it has been customary only to make room for a few personal servants . The Wilson and Coolidges brought none , the Hoovers six ; these were the extremes . At present-1931-there are many who have been here twenty years or more , and one butler who has been here more than forty years , except for the four years of Cleveland 's second term . Three of the four colored doormen installed by Mrs. Taft still are on the job . The housekeeper hires the domestics , the Chief Usher his assistants and others of that character ; the mechanics are employed by the office of Public Buildings and Parks , all subject to the approval of the mistress . She can , of course , and sometimes does , hire a servant direct , acting on the recommendation of a friend . No butler , floor man or other who comes into frequent close contact with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen him . Mrs. Harding and Mrs. Hoover were most particular in this respect . Mrs. Coolidge and both Mrs. Wilsons relied on the judgment of the housekeeper or Chief Usher . Discharge is almost unknown ; and as few quit of their own accord , death and disability provide such openings as occur . Neither old nor new employes are given any formal medical examination . It is only since Wilson that a doctor has been constantly in attendance , with an office here . Before that , service surgeons were appointed to the White House , but they waited to be called in . In the event of illness , the family was quite as likely to call a doctor in private practice . In the absence of proof to the contrary , the President 's health was pretty much taken for granted , that of the employes entirely so . Admiral Grayson and his successors , Sawyer , Coupal and Boone , have kept a general eye on the physical welfare of the staff and a close one on the President 's , sometimes to the noticeable exasperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have thrown the doctor out if he had not dreaded the fuss . His objection was more to the surveillance than to the man . There is not an idle inch of space in the house , and if there were twice as much , we could find use for it . In making these notes , I counted the rooms . Eliminating bathrooms and alcoves , but including all else , there are sixty-eight . It sounds like a great many , but No. 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue really is a small house relative to what is asked of it . On the lower , sometimes called the basement floor , as a tourist enters from the east , is the guard room and a long cloak room which takes up the entire space under the east terrace . Entering the house proper on this level , there are three rooms on the left , open to the public from ten until two , except on Sundays and holidays , and in the summer , when the closing hour is one o'clock . Two are furnished as living rooms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left is the old billiard room , now the doctor 's office . Adjoining is a servants ' dining room and another used by the help . Tour of the White House Returning to the east . door and looking to the right , the first room is a large one used as an employes ' locker . Next is the original kitchen , now the commodious engine room . The great old fireplaces in which all the cooking was done for half a century still are there . The present kitchen adjoins , on the west , one large and two small rooms . Under the west terrace are many rooms , another dining room for the help , a large room for the florist , a small one for the Army and Navy aides , another for the State Department aide and two more for the social bureau . At the extreme end are three rooms , two used by one of Mr. Hoover 's secretaries , the other by the secret-service force . Entering the house by the front door on the main floor , there is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous East Room on one end of the house and to the state dining room on the other . The East Room is open to the public . Between , on the soul lr , are the three parlors , Green , Blue and Red , looking from east to west . The breakfast room and pantry adjoin the state dining room . The one remaining room is called the usher 's , but is used for every purpose under the sun . Going to the second floor by the grand staircase or by elevator , the guest emerges in another corridor reaching from the east to the west wall . Beginning in the southeast . corner , there is a suits used by Lincoln as an office and cabinet room , and restored to a study and conference room by the Hoovers . Like all suites on this floor , it is composed of a large room , a dressing room and a bath . No part of the upper floors is open to the public at any time . The three parlors and the state dining room on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present requests from members of Congress and other ranking Government officers . Next on the south side , moving west , is what is now the Rose Drawing-Room , arranged by Mrs. Hoover when the President vacated it as a study . Adjoining this is the Oval Room , or library , then a bedroom , and on to another suite in the southwest corner which has been used as the sleeping THE SATURDAY quarters of most of the Presidents in modern times . These pleasant rooms overlook the rear grounds . Mrs. Taft was the first to introduce twin beds into them , displacing the famous Lincoln bed ? a great , old-fashioned affair with a headboard topped by a canopy and a gold crown . Mrs. Taft long lay ill on one of these beds , and the first Mrs. Wilson died on one . The second Mrs. Wilson banished the twin beds to another suite and returned the Lincoln bed . Mrs. Harding brought back the twin beds and occupied one in her serious illness . The Cootidges moved these beds to the boys ' room and Calvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to Walter Reed Hospital , where he died . Crossing the corridor to the northwest corner , there is a corresponding suite , now known as the Lincoln , due to the fact that all the identified furniture of his time has been assembled here . Cleveland and McKinley were the two Presidents in - my time who slept there , looking out on Pennsylvania Avenue . Next , as the guest moves back east , is a small hall room that shares space with the elevator shaft ; then the blue bedroom , the yellow bedroom and the head of the grand staircase . The blue bedroom was assigned permanently to Mr. and Mrs. Stearns during the Coolidge time . These Boston friends spent more than half their time in the White House . The rose suite occupies the space between the head of the stairs and the east wall . As the grand staircase ends at this floor , we take the elevator or return to the other end and mount the domestics ' stairway to the top story . When I came here , it was an attic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of past administrations , to be gnawed by the rats . Roosevelt had a stairway built and two rooms partitioned off . The Tafts added more rooms , the Wilsons still more  --  this being the only part of the house capable of expansion . When a new roof was put on in the Coolidge time , the floor was converted from a makeshift and an overflow into habitable quarters . Saluaging an Attic Here , again , is the long east-andwest corridor , with rooms on each side and a suite at each end used as servants ' quarters . On the south side are four rooms intended as guest quarters , but occupied in Mrs. Hoover 's time by her secretaries . Of the other two rooms on this side , one is the sewing room , and the other is the valet 's quarters . On the north side of the corridor the housekeeper has two rooms ; there are two linen rooms , a cedar room for winter storing and three general storerooms . A large hall leads from the corridor to a great room taking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stored the extra chairs needed for musicales and the great dinners . The number of servants who sleep in , varies . Now all the colored help are sleeping out and the housekeeper , four cooks , two bedroom maids and the President 's valet are living on this floor . There have been times when both white and Negro help have slept in . I have not counted the fourteen private baths and ten lavatories . When I went to work here there were only two baths , and they dated only from the Arthur Administration , a few years earlier . A White House without baths Marketing for the White House The steward , Crump , stayed on with the Garfields . When Cleveland came , he brought as steward William Sinclair , who had served him in Albany . Sinclair went out and returned with Cleveland , then remained on with McKinley . Mrs. Taft finally abolished the office of steward and substituted a housekeeper , appointing Mrs. Elizabeth Jaffrey . Even then Mrs. Taft examined every bill before it was paid . The marketing is done by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days the buying was done at the public markets and White House wagons returned with the cream of the crops . Now the telephone is used , patronage is distributed among the higher-class groceries , and deliveries are made by the shops . The food budget is liberal ; the best the market affords is demanded and no reasonable price protested , The one exception was the February lo , r9.34 Coolidge term , when most of the buying , meats included , was done at the chain stores . If you work at the White House you may expect to work overtime and to accept added responsibilities . That of secrecy , loyalty , discretion applies to the humblest , not so much personal loyalty to the incumbent as loyalty to the office . The atmosphere of the house would be intolerable if the President had to look on all hands as eavesdroppers ; he must take their loyalty for granted . State and personal secrets are n't shouted , but in a house so littered daily with confidences , some must reach the ears of the least employe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , the servants gossip among themselves , but reporters can testify that little information seeps out the back doors . What is known in the theater as doubling in brass is common here . The doormen also act as messengers , running errands through the house , and as policemen in necessity . , One is a barber and does all the tonsorial work of the President and family and , at times , their guests . The floor men , after a day of shining and polishing , may be called at night for extra duty in the dining room or cloak rooms . The mechanical staff are pressed in as carriage callers and for other outside work in handling the crowds at the larger functions . The Usher 's Job What does an usher do ? Nearly everything , including ushering , though this is the least of his work . The title is a misnomer . He has been called a major-domo , a master of ceremonies , lord chamberlain , master of the household , custodian , prompter , head guide and head doorman . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office has been a gradual evolution from the original job of tending door . To avoid confusion , the title was changed to Chief Usher under the reclassification act passed March 4 , 1923 . It might be said that anything not obviously the responsibility of another employe falls into the usher 's lap . His room , located at the main entrance , is the clearing house of the establishment , and his telephone much the busiest of all . The office is open twenty-four hours a day , for the Secret-Service men and inside police detail on duty make it their headquarters . The Chief Usher passes judgment on the eligibility of every person who crosses the threshold . In consultation with the First Lady and the President , he makes all plans for any form of entertainment or hospitality , personal , social or official , and is present to see that the plans are carried out . He is responsible under the President and his wife for every guest , he is the keeper of the precedents and he carries a figurative oil can with which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as sixteen to eighteen hours a day ; Sundays and holidays are only words to him . When I had been in the White House forty years , it was estimated that I actually had put in at least fifty years . A common remark by White House workers as the crowds stream by from the Government buildings at five in the evening and noon on Saturday is : " They have positions , we have jobs . " In recent years the mechanical force have managed to create an eight-hourday precedent for themselves , except in the social season or emergencies , but there are no hours for the rest of us . Inevitably , the employes have their favorites among Presidents , but this is mostly in retrospect . While he is in office , he is " The President " and automatically commands the respect , even reverence , with which the office is vested in our eyes . But when he leaves office , it is the man rather than the President we are apt to remember . Of the nine under whom I have served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of popularity with the staff . It does not follow that they thought him the greatest . It was the charm of his personality . The routine goes on at the White House when the President and his family are away . The strain lifts and there is less to do , yet enough . Repairs are made to rooms not easily accessible when the family is home , and loose ends gathered . The outward sign is that the flag does not fly from the staff . The flag is symbolical of the presence of the President , not necessarily in the White House but in the city . The real boss here is the system , a product of trial and error through many administrations . Its ways and precedents are not hollow forms or the stubborn habits of servants , but oils on troubled waters . Through the years , practice has demonstrated that this or that way is the simplest and most sa tisfactory of doing the things that must be done , in the space and with the facilities available . Some occupants have challenged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , knew the White House intimately before they came . They had watched how things were done without always being aware of the expediencies that dictated the method . They had not always approved , and they came determined on changes . For a few weeks , in such a case , all is different . New ways are directed and an honest effort made to carry them out . But usually the ways have been tried before and discarded for cause . Soon they are discarded again , many times unconsciously . The old order creeps back . The system bends , but returns . Others , such as the McKinleys , Wilsons and Coolidges , took the White House as it was , to their greater ease and comfort . The lIcKinleys and Coolidges knew the house well before they came , the Wilsons never had been inside it , I believe . Alter the system , the boss is more often the wife than the President , as is proper in a home . Some have left everything to the First Lady , out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them to do . Coolidge had both the interest and the authority , and he delved into everything , often to the annoyance of the help , who were used to another reckoning . As in nearly all else , Mr. Hoover was Mr. Coolidge 's opposite . In the former 's obliviousness to the routine , he seemed unaware of the servants . What they took for neglect more probably was the abstraction of a man who never for a moment stopped working and worrying .
