txt With the passage of a bill to establish New Jersey 's part of an Interstate Sanitation Commission , the New Jersey Legislature has brought the hope of cleaning up New York Harbor a step nearer realization . New York acted in 1931 and needs only to make minor changes to conform to the New Jersey provisions . With these two States in agreement , the commission will come into existence when the approval of Congress is secured , without the necessity of immediate participation by Connecticut , which is still looked for . Although a step has now been taken , and a most important one , it must not be assumed that the way to a clean harbor is as yet entirely clear . There are some difficult legal and financial questions to be answered and many details of procedure to be worked out before the administrative machinery can be put into action , and it may be many months before anything effective can be done . So vast is the problem that it may be years before any general improvement in the condition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To get a fair idea of the undertaking that faces the commission , it is necessary to take a birdseye view of the territory to be covered and of the ' present conditions of sewerage and of sewage disposal . Under the Tri-State plan the most crowded sections of the three States are involved , with an aggregate population , according to the 1930 census , of 11,948,180 . Of this , 67 per cent is in New York State , 25 per cent in New Jersey and 8 per cent in Connecticut . On the New York side of the State line which divides New York Harbor is the City of New York , with its hundreds of relatively short , tide-locked sewers discharging all along its extensive waterfront . On the New Jersey side of the State line are some 200 municipalities , only a few of which are situated on the shores of the harbor . Many of these have combined to form sewerage districts , with trunk sewers carrying the sewage to the tidal waters for discharge . One of these is the Passaic Valley sewer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sewage of Paterson , Newark and a dozen other municipalities to New York Bay ; the capacity is sufficient for the sewage of about 1,600,000 persons . The Passaic Valley District and sewer are excluded from the jurisdiction of the Tri-State commission . To improve the condition of the harbor , sewage treatment works must be built on the shores of the harbor . There must be many of them . The cost of cleaning up the harbor , if the job is done thoroughly , will be very large . Alternative plans put out in 1931 by the Department of Sanitation of the City of New York for the proper treatment of the sewage of the metropolis called for an expenditure of $243,500,000 for Plan A , and $377,935,000 for Plan B , the difference in cost indicating the difference in the thoroughness of the treatment . No estimates have been made for the whole metropolitan territory , but , taking Plan . A as a basis for the cost of treating all the sewage of the metropolitan district , it would seem that an expenditure of at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would not all be built simultaneously , nor would the full effect be apparent for a very long time . The authority conferred upon the Tri-State Sanitation Commission is to compel the treatment of sewage to such a degree as will protect and improve the tidal waters to the extent which the commission deems necessary . It is not to construct works itself nor is it to prescribe processes . The water areas are to be classified according to their uses and the sewage is to be purified to the degree called for . Powers of Commission . Whenever , in the opinion of the commission , a discharge of sewage is injurious to the public health or welfare , the commission may issue an order on the offender to show cause why such discharge should not be discontinued or why the commission should not issue an order to correct the condition . The commission may make rules and regulations , conduct investigations and issue orders , and do other things necessary for the proper performance of its functions . Whenever the commission is of opinion that any of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its legal representative to commence an action or proceeding in the name of the commission in an appropriate court to have the violation stopped by mandamus or injunction . The Supreme Court of each State is given jurisdiction in such cases as arise in that State .
