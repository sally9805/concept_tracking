( See front cover ) <P> Earnest , black-mustached , ivory-spectacled Hirohito is not Emperor of Japan by the grace of God . Rather his people conceive that their country is an Empire by His grace . Last week this extraordinary personage , adored as the " Son of Heaven , " faced firmly one of the most involved and ominous crises since his reign began six years ago . <P> Hirohito was not crowned . Instead , upon his father 's death in 1926 he assumed protection of Japan 's three Sacred Treasures : The Sword which commands " Be Brave ! " The Jewel which says " Enlighten thyself ! " and the Most Sacred Mirror of the Sun Goddess Amaterasu-Omikami which enjoins " Know thyself ! " <P> In November 1928 the Son of Heaven was not only enthroned as Japan 's Emperor . He also ascended " The August High Seat " as the Shinto Pope . But neither as Pope nor as Emperor is Hirohito first in Japanese hearts . His unique position derives from the fact that Japanese believe they are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of 124 Emperors . Thus Japanese revere their Son of Heaven as the corporeal head and spiritual father of the national family . Their language abounds in such maxims as " Judges enforce the Law but the Emperor does Justice . " As a divine being the Son of Heaven can no more do wrong than Jehovah or Allah . Nevertheless , last week in Japan his recent acts were under unusually close scrutiny . <P> " National Government . " After the assassination of Premier Ki ( " Old Fox " ) Inukai amid a welter of national resentment against " corrupt politicians " ( TIME , May 23 ) , Emperor Hirohito commanded Admiral Viscount Saito to form a new Cabinet . When this Cabinet was formed last week it proved to be a " National Government " ( as in Great Britain ) but almost as full of so-called " corrupt politicians " as the last Seiyukai Party Cabinet headed by " Old Fox . " Specifically the Japanese national family was surprised that the Army and the Treasury have been left in exactly the same hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by men of the fighting services , Japanese public opinion assumed that War Minister Lieut. - General Sadao Araki must hand in his resignation , demanded by Japanese custom . Instead General Araki took the line that Premier Inukai had been assassinated by cadets and therefore it would be sufficient if General Nobuyoshi Muto , Director of Military Education , should resign . This he did-and was promptly raised to membership in the Supreme War Council . Meanwhile the police continued to hold secret the names of the assassins of Premier Inukai who voluntarily gave themselves up . From the first , strong Tokyo rumors have insisted that not all of these young men are cadets , that one or more are junior officers of Japan 's regular Army . <P>
