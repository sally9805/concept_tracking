Rather more than an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth was exacted last week by the Soviet Court which tried the murderers of Pavel , 13 , and Fedor , 9 , Russia 's famed " good children " who peached on their father Trophim Morosov and had him banished for the crime of " obstructing collectivization " ( TIME , Dec. 5 ) . <P> Though the court sat in Gerasimovka , an insignificant village in remote Sverdlovsk Province in the Ural Mountains , every detail of this " propaganda trial " was published and broadcast throughout Russia . Too many villagers had stabbed and hacked the two " good children " for all the assassins to be shot . One woman and three men were sentenced to " the supreme measure of social defense " : Death by shooting . Three of the condemned were close kin of Pavel &; Fedor .
