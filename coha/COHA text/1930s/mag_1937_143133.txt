Favorite observation of saturnine old newspapermen , who remember how rich Groceryman Frank Andrew Munsey bought 17 important newspapers between 1912 and 1924 and killed half of them through his thumping ignorance of practical newspapering , is that nothing has been right in the profession since " the grocers took over the newspaper business . " Last week the grocers got a better grip on the magazine business . <P> It all started five years ago when spry little Harry Evans began giving away the monthly Family Circle , which now goes to 1,477,000 housewives over the counters of five important grocery chains . Last week the 15,000 stores of the Great Atlantic &; Pacific Tea Co. became newsstands for an even more pretentious giveaway . From 215,000 contest entries A. &; P. paid two women each $1,000 for the title Woman 's Day . Mrs. Haydie Yates , who once ran a western dude ranch and became managing editor of Today and New York Woman in rapid succession , was selected to serve up a magazine of household utility , designed to tell women how to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hints , the 8-in. by 11-in. 32-page magazine will carry no fiction or film gossip as does Family Circle . <P> Publisher of Woman 's Day is Stores Publishing Co. , an A. &; P. subsidiary . Its president is A. &; P. Adman Donald Parker Hanson , who will send the magazine in bulk to individual A. &; P. stores at cost , less any advertising income . Its first issue of 815,000 copies carried over $13,000 in paid advertising , nearly half from A. &; P. and its manufacturing subsidiaries . <P> The suspicious advertising trade could look in vain through Woman 's Day for signs that A. &; P. intended to use its magazine for editorial propagandizing in favor of chain stores . The Robinson-Patman Act was designed in part to end the evils of advertising allowances from manufacturer to retailer , and Publisher Hanson has stoutly denied that Woman 's Day is an attempt to salvage these lost allowances . However , six manufacturers from whom A. &; P. buys goods are represented in the first issue of Woman 's Day . <P> Publisher Hanson will continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose to 750.000 circulation , has cost his company a million dollars in six years . The first Thursday of each month the Menu will be part of Woman 's Day . With true grocery psychology , A. &; P. printed on the cover of free Woman 's Day : " Price 3 " coyly crossed out the figure .
