txt President Roosevelt sent to Congress today a special message asking for immediate amendment , of the Neutrality Act to eliminate its compulsory arms embargo . This action was necessary , the Chief Executive declared , so that the United States might be on record on the side of preserving world peace , and so that the country would be in the best position to avoid involvement if a general war should break out despite preventive efforts . Thus for the first time Mr. Roosevelt formally asked for specific changes in the neutrality law , although he has several times previously stated that he thought the statute was not satisfactory . The message took the form of a brief Presidential introduction indorsing and calling to the attention of Congress a detailed statement on the subject by Secretary Hull . The net effect seemed to be that the President has transferred the issue of revision from Congress to the country . The message was received in the Senate and in tho House largely on that basis , and it was believed that Mr. Roosevelt would have much to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which he has tentatively scheduled to start four days after the adjournment of Congress . European Situation Noted . The message pointed to the critical situation likely to prevail in Europe for the next several months , and divided , without naming them , the countries of the world into two categories : those bent on forceful change and those desiring to preserve peace . Secretary Hull found t hat proponents and opponents of revision are agreed on four cardinal principles of American foreign policy . These he listed as the conviction that the United States must consider first its own peace and security ; that the American Government must avoid being drawn into wars between other nations ; that this country must steer clear of entangling alliances or involvements , and that this country must maintain strict neutrality to avoid being drawn into war . The Administration , lie said , believes that an arms embargo is a dangerous departure from the practices of international law , while the opponents of change believe thb trade in armaments inevitably tends toward involvement and is " immoral . " After more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " neutrality " legislation which have been in effect , Mr. Hull reached the conclusion that " the present embargo encourages a general state of war both it Europe and Asia . " Sees Threat to This Country The result , the Secretary stated , " is directly prejudicial to the highest interests and to the peace and to the security of the United States , " since this ? ountry can be at its best only in a peaceful world . The aggressors are " more tempted to try the fortunes of Nv a r " if they know their less-prepared opponents " would be shut off from those supplies which , under every rule of international law , they should ho able to buy in all neutral countries , including the United States . " The message pointed out that " almost all sales of arms and ammunition made in xecent years by our nationals have been made to governments whose policies have been dedicated to the maintenance of peace . " Mr. Hull recalled the many years he spent as a member of both houses of Congress in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in solving the external problems facing this country . " A peaceful nation like ours can not complacently clJse its eyes and ears in formulating a peace and neutrality policy , as though abnor- mal and critical conditions did not exist , " he said . Congress to " Wait and See " The attitude of Administration leaders in Congress seemed to be one of " wait and see . " No plans were discussed to take swift action too d realizat on of the President 's recommendation- . The opponents of revision have repeatedly stated during the debates that there is no sizable public opinion in favor of changing the law , and that the proposed changes are dictated merely by the personal fancies of Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Hull . Under those circumstances , there probably will be a lull in Congressional proceedings for a few days to see how the public responds to the latest Presidential appeal . If that response does not develop in measurable volume , it is highly probable that the question will be allowed to rest in the comparative oblivion which the Senate Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress will begin setting the stage for quick adjournment . Senator Barkley , majority leader , and Senator Pittman , chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , praised the message but added that they had no plans for carrying it into effect . " I think it is an unanswerable argument , " Mr. Pittman said . " I was particularly pleased with the calm and tolerant manner in which he stated the position of the executive branch of the government . I am sure it will clarify the subject in the minds of the people of the country . " Borah Sees Nothing New Senator Borah , however , found nothing new in it . " These are the same arguments we all considered before voting to postpone action on the neutrality subject , " he said . " They are arguments presented heretofore . Other than this , I only want to say one thing : In the present condition of European affairs , the sale of armaments , in my opinion , will inevitably involve the United States in the imperialistic war that is now in progress openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I liked the message , but I do not know whether it will do any good . " Senator Vandenberg , one of the most active leaders of the opposition , said that most of Mr. Hull 's suggestions were " substantially part of the existing Neutrality Law upon which I continue to rely . " " His departures would chiefly involve the repeal of the arms embargo and the creation of new Presidential discretions , " the Michigan Republican added . " He argues that the maintenance of the existing law results in partialities ; but he answers himself by pleading for the alternative partialities which the abandonment of the existing law would produce . " The former partialities , if any , are not unneutral because they are the natural result of rules written ahead of the necessity for their application . The latter partialities would be specifically unneutral because they would flow from our deliberate choice . In my view , that way lies the larger possibility of war for the United States . I can not and will not take it . " Hiram Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition , found nothing in Mr. Hull 's arguments to please him . " When Mr. Hull speaks of our duty to contribute to the preservation of peace , " he said , " he apparently means that we shall indicate s clearly our intention to support one group of belligerents that the other group will be deterred in its designs , and think twice before precipitating a struggle with nations who are already assured of our military and economic support . Certainly , this is not neutrality . This is a mere gambling assumption . It is intervention or military alliance and we want none of it . " In the House . comment followed the sides the various Representatives took two weeks ago during the floor debate , when the arms embargo was forced back into the Bloom resolution by a narrow matgin . Those who had supported the Administration liked the message and their opponents found that it told them nothing new . Lending Measures Still Lag The lending program for " selfliquidating " public works which the President has recommended is fast reaching the stage where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe . Several other measures are on the preferred list , including the Hatch bill to bar Federal employes from political activities . Still on the " must " calendar is a final deficiency appropriation bill , which is usually held until the last day of each session and carries necessary funds not already included in the regular supply bills . The $2,460.000,000 lending program was still in the " dead " spot which it hit soon after reaching Capitol Hill . Leaders considered it quite unlikely that it would get through both houses in anything like the amount and form prescribed in the Barkley-Steagall Enabling Bill . Apprehensive lest its curtailment might he considered as another Administration defeat , these leaders were contemplating asking the President to use the authorities of existing law and not press Congress for action on the new bill at this session . It was estimated that the greatest part of the lending program for the current fiscal year , which began on July 1 , could be carried out under laws already on the books .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
