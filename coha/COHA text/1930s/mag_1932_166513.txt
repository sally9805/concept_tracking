Sirs : <P> In TIME , May 16 , in your article headed " Locusts , " you quote the President of the U. S. as saying that the halls of Congress were ' ' haunted by a locust swarm of lobbyists " and then TIME remarks , " . . . active and successful lobbies which pay their legislative agents $10,000 or so per year to secure Congressional favors include the following . . . . Motorists . The American Automobile Association , whose special pleader is Alexander E. Johnson , failed to block a Senate increase in the automobile tax . " <P> This Association employs no legislative agent , never has employed one to my knowledge , has no such man as Alexander E. Johnson on its payroll and no one at our headquarters has ever heard of such an individual in Washington . A director of our affiliated Louisville , Ky . Automobile Club named Alex E. Johnson is Chairman of our Legislative Committee , the principal function of which is to outline and formulate policies for submission to our annual convention . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time , has taken no part in the presentation of our views on national taxation . He does not and has not received any compensation from this organization . <P> Furthermore , in the interests of editorial accuracy , may I point out that the Senate has neither accepted nor rejected an increase in the auto tax as it has not in this session had the question before it for vote . . . . <P> We do not assume that you would classify the appearance of business men before committees of Congress to set forth their views on legislation of vital importance to them as " lobbying . " <P> <P> ERNEST N. SMITH <P> Executive Vice President American Automobile Association Washington , D.C. <P> 1 ) TIME 'S source of information was the A. A. A. 's publicity department . 2 ) Yes , TIME does designate as " lobbying " the appearance in Washington of citizens endeavoring to influence legislation to their own benefit . But TIME attaches no stigma to such lobbying , either by paid or unpaid agents , where openly &; honestly conducted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislative procedure . <P> Chief current criticism of U. S. lobbying has been aimed at the delay and confusion caused . Outside of regular hearings there have been much buttonholing in corridors , much crowding around committee room doors , much pestering of legislators at homes , hotels , clubs . Many States require lobbyists to register as such , sometimes to pay fees . Not so in Washington . The late sarcastic Senator Caraway used to call the lobbyists " The Third House . " Others have suggested that lobbyists be recognized and dignified as such , given a forum of their own in Washington , given rules &; regulations and caused to function as a debating body in the Government where the private friends &; foes of legislation could air their views for the edification of busy legislators. - ED . <P> <P> Sirs :
