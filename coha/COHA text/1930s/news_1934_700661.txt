txt Adjournment of Congress next Saturday is " possible but not probable , " Speaker Rainey of the House said today . The House , operating under its re cently adopted " emergency control " which the Republicans call a " gag " rule , can be ready to quit by Saturday , but a different situation exists in the Senate , where the rule of unlimited speech-making may delay adjournment indefinitely in the event the administration insists on passage of the Wagner Labor Dispute Bill and the enactment of housing legislation , members of Congress assert . There is strong opposition to both propositions . The Senate is expected to pass the Silver Purchase Bill late tomorrow or Tuesday , and the Wagner Bill may be called up by Senator Walsh , chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor , immediately silver is out of the way . If the Wagner Bill Is made the " unfinished business " following the final vote on the Silver Bill , many Senators believe the result will be to prolong the session for a week or possibly ten days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the problem rests mainly with the President . If he insists on labor and housing legislation , Congressional leaders say , adjournment next Saturday appears to be definitely out of thequestion . If he agrees to abandon the legislation , adjournment is possible . President Roosevelt returned to the White House in the late afternoon from an overnight cruise aboard the Sequoia , on which he took two large baskets of official memoranda for study with Louis Howe , his secretary , but he did not indicate whether he had reached any decisions that would affect the legislative program . Despite the difficulties apparently in the way of adjournment , the Democratic leaders will use every effort to clear the legislative slate by Saturday , and in some quarters it is considered quite probable that adjournment may be reached late that night after a last-minute shuffle of pending legislation such as frequently has characterized the closing hours of a Congressional session . There is a remote possibility that the Wagner Bill may be removed as a stumbling block to quick action through a hasty revision of its text , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admittedly debatable . Members Eager to Go Home , Perhaps the most compelling force working for adjournment on June 16 is one that has no connection with the actual business of Congress . It is sometimes referred to privately as the " election itch , " and is a nervous condition manifested by members of the House and those Senators facing election fights who find it increasingly difficult to sit in their seats in the legislative halls and postpone a return to their political battlegrounds a moment longer than is necessary . There also remains on the Senate calendar the Deficiency Appropriations Bill which places in the Pres // ident 's control a potential emergency relief and recovery fund varying between $2,500,000,000 and $6,000,000,000 , and the bill appropriating $525,000,000 for the relief of farmers in the drought States . The House has passed the Deficiency Bill and is expected to take prompt . action on the drought relief measure early this week , probably passing the latter by an overwhelming majority under its suspension of the rules . The Deficiency Bill is still pending in the Senate Committee on Appropriations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That it will pass is certain , but how long the debate will last is not known . Harriman in an Appeal . Henry I. Harriman , president of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States , sent a letter to Senator Glass , chairman of the committee , today in which he urged on behalf of the chamber that expenditures under the Deficiency Bill be held to an amount which would permit a balanced budget in the fiscal year 1936 . " The Deficiency Appropriation Bill passed by the House and now before your committee makes possible , " Mr. Harriman said in his letter , " expenditures much in excess of those requested in the budget . Any excess of . this kind will operate against a balance of the budget in 1936 , even if taxes were somewhat increased . " We urge that the Senate limit expenditures authorized by the Deficiency Bill , or any other appropriation measure , to an amount that will permit . the realization of a budget balance in 1936 . If the power to transfer Reconstruction Finance Corporation funds for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deficiency Bill , it would appear advisable for Congress to fix the limits of such transfers at an amount which will permit maintenance of a program for a balance of receipts and expenditures in the fiscal year ending with June 30 , 1936.
