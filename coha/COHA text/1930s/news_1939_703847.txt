txt That Pope Pius XII came to the throne of the Papal Sovereign State upon his birthday is another one of those coincidences into which many observers read a significance that even when estimated by practical and not mystical considerations seems wholly justified . It is compared to the new birth into a higher life that the supreme rulers of the Catholic Church alone can know , that may , that almost certainly will , begin a new epoch in the history of the central organization of the Catholic Church as it moves forward into a conflict with the organized forces of State absolutism , of materialistic atheism and racial heresies . The fighting front has already been fully drawn in two great countries , . Germany and Russia . It is rapidly developing its lines in Italy , the very home of Catholic Christianity for nearly 2,000 years , and it is being extended to many other parts of the world . It is a war , moreover , that in many other lands , including the United States and South America , is proceeding in scattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what its proponents hope will be in time a declared alliance with the greater powers of modern paganism that now control so much of humanity . New Problem Faced This commentator is still overwrought , perhaps , with the impact of the swift , determined action of the College of Cardinals . There was a spirit-stirring excitement of the hour that struck its fateful signal when the announcement went forth to the city and to the world of the coming to power of Pope Pius XII and the clamor of bells in Rome 's thousand of temples of the Catholic Christian faith . The St. Peter 's " Campanone , " or big bell , solemnly thundered above all those calling the faithful to prayer and rejoicing . This commentator still realizes that it may be considered that he is exaggerating the particular problem sketched above which must now be faced by the new Pope . It may be said , especially by Catholic critics , that after all and above all the true significance of today 's events is to be found in the simple enduring fact that St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of doing all that his own natural powers , aided , as Catholics believe , by the supernatural power of God 's grace , can accomplish to administer religion pure and undefiled in the name of Christ to the sinstricken souls of mankind . All other problems , even so grave a one as the relationship of Ow world-wide church with the worldwide opposing power of organized atheism and materialism , they hold are accidental , not of substance to today 's story . School Issue Raised It may be so . Nevertheless , even such convinced Catholic upholders of the spiritual primacy of wholly supernatural motives in church government were anxiously discussing and pondering the ominous nature of the most recent school legislation adopted by the Italian Government on Feb. 15 , only one day after the burial of Pope Pius XI and while ceremonies of mourning for his parting were still proceeding in Italy 's churches . At least these Catholics , including , of course , - many ? who are far from being mere observers of the church but who are active and prominent participants in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glad exOktement of the election and the announcement scenes , particularly the new Pope 's blessing from the exterior balcony of St. Peter 's , temporarily overcame such worries and forebodings as they had expressed in confidence and with deep emphasis to the writer . But these Catholics who may deprecate the prominence given to lesser considerations are , it may be said with a fair degree of confidence , in the minority among Catholics . What may be termed a majority of practical realistic Catholics  --  without , of course , inferring a real distinction between these two groups in principle but merely a distinction in their mode of action in their conversations with this writer  --  consider the problems of racial doctrine and State supremacy with which the church must deal as inseparably connected with its bigger spiritual mission . Right to Educate These observers told of the late Pope 's concern with the great issue of free education of Christian children along the lines chosen by their own parents and the church 's right to that free and full performance of its teaching . It has maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very nature of its being , must still maintain it in spite of all opposition . It may be and often is defeated on this or that section of the battle , and its branches here and there may be crushed , but the root remains and the very root of the whole matter is its faith in what it holds to be its divine and not human mission . From that root it invariably has put forth new shoots in the past ' struggles with secular powers that would not compromise , and its servants , high and low , still cling to that fruitful faith . So say these practical observers . They declare that the new Italian education laws will work a great hardship on the church . They fear that their coming into operation during the period of mourning for the late Pope is indicative of the determination with which a powerful section of the government is pursuing its announced intention of reducing religion in Italy to what they term its essential spiritual dimensions . Practical Catholics term this a condition of innocuous desuetude , to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Patronage " In other words , if the government goes ahead on the lines drawn by this group within itself , which is closely allied with a similar group dominating the German Nazi Government , the Catholic Church will receive high praise and a certain amount of patronage , so to speak , provided it obeys the totalitarian governments ' dictum that the only thing religious people should do is pray . But these practical Catholics in Italy and , of course , in Germany , and all practical Protestants as well , believe in the Benedictine maxim that work as well as prayer belongs to the worship of God . They , therefore , are far from content with the reduction of Catholic Action in Italy and all forms of active Christianity in Germany to a bodiless state of abstract religiosity . The real point about Christian supernaturalism is the belief that the spirit does not operate effectively , at least in human affairs and conditions without being united with and cooperative with the more obvious forces of matter and flesh . Above all they point out that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that man might rise toward God ; that any mere earthly state or philosophy should attempt to change God 's law for a pagan law of force and pride is not to be tolerated . So they conclude that in this election of a new head of the Catholic Church , whatever worldly wiseacres may say or however nations ' rulers may take counsel together against what Catholics must claim to be the Lord 's anointed vessel for his work , the work is God 's work and may well be considered to have provided a human agent fit to carry it on . History alone will reveal in time to come whether or not this faith in Pope Pius XII is justifiable . That he enters on his task with the full support of his brethren of the episcopacy  --  who are still his brothers , although now he is their mystical and yet very real father , since he is their father in God as well  --  needs no further demonstration than the circumstance of his swift election . This broke an ancient precedent that heretofore has ruled that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become its ruler . It shattered also the wisecracks ? if that very descriptive bit of American vernacular may be used  --  that were rife in Vatican City and Rome to the effect that Cardinal Pacelli was too closely identified with the rule of the late Pope ever to be chosen by those who for long had obeyed that rule but not always gladly . In an age of smashing of precedents this demonstration of the energy and promptness with which the church 's ancient organism can function will be welcome indeed not only to Catholics but to millions of those who look to the Catholic Church for leadership or cooperation in humanity 's struggle to attain civilized liberty and humane conditions of life . Blessing by Pacelli This commentator will carry from the Vatican . City a precious personal memory which he may be pardoned for mentioning . It was his good fortune not only to receive his individual share of the blessing of the city and the world from this son of Rome  --  the Pope is the first Rome-born Pontiff in many centuries  --  who today became the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a private and personal blessing bestowed on a small group of Americans whom Bishop Daniel F. Desmond of Alexandria , La. , introduced to Cardinal Pacelli three days ago in his Vatican apartment . Mr. and Mrs. Neeley of Shreveport , La. , were the other two of a party of four . The Cardinal , in the midst of all his tremendous responsibilities at the time , was his ordinary gracious self . He spoke of his recent visit to the United States , of his love for the people of our country and of his hope for another longer visit . But Mrs. Neeley made bold to say what no doubt was in all our minds : " But , Your Eminence , though we Americans would most gladly welcome you , we think you must remain in the Vatican . " Cardinal Pacelli made no reply except a gentle smile , but it may be said with full confidence that the sentiments expressed by him as a Cardinal will remain with him as Pope Pius XII .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
