Preparing for a six-day convention of 2,000 delegates , factotums of Chicago 's Hotel Sherman last week installed the usual facilities : a microphone and loudspeaker in the convention hall , a glittering screen behind the speakers ' platform . All this unfortunately was not evidence of tact and foresight . The delegates were members of the National Association of the Deaf . The microphone was useless and the glittering screen had to be replaced by a black one before the audience could see what the speakers were saying . <P> Almost as inappropriate as the hall 's equipment in the alert eyes of the deaf-mutes , was the message from President Roosevelt read off to them on his nimble fingers by the N. A. D. 's dapper President Marcus Levi Kenner of Manhattan . Deaf-mutes applaud by waving their hands in the air , but the President 's hope " that the present great activity in those branches of physics affecting acoustics may result in the development of vastly improved aids to hearing " caused only perfunctory gesticulations . Fact is that the nation 's 100,000 stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear a sound . Their problem is not acoustics but ameliorating the disadvantages of deafness , most serious of which is difficulty in getting jobs . <P> The deaf-mutes who attended the convention of the 57-year-old organization last week danced to the music of a five-piece band , which they felt through their feet . They learned that the only " impostor " ( a person of sound hearing who poses as deaf to cadge charitable upkeep ) to appear during the past three years , one Charles Burton of Altoona . Pa. , had been punished by law , then killed by a motorcar . They pointed with pride to the deaf-mutes who make high mark in the world today-Sculptor Elmer A. Hannon , Poet Howard Leslie Terry , blind Pianist Helen May Martin , Dancers Charlotte &; Charles Lamberton , Dentist A. H. Clancy of Cincinnati , Broker Samuel Frankenheim of Manhattan , Research Librarian Elizabeth McLeod of the New York Public Library , President Arthur Lawrence Roberts of the National Fraternal Society of the Deaf ( a $2,000,000 insurance company exclusively for deaf-mutes ) , N. A. D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance bureau . In general , nonetheless , discontent ruled the convention . Scarcely a finger was crooked concerning the causes of deaf-mutism ( chiefly whooping cough , scarlet fever , various types of meningitis , severe falls ) . But knuckles bent , palms flipped , wrists twisted over many grievances : <P> The talkies fail to print subtitles throughout the films . Hence deaf-mutes who dislike reading lips can not understand all of the action . <P> Many states do not permit deaf-mutes to drive cars , unless they secure liability insurance . But insurance companies in some cases refuse to issue policies to deaf-mutes . Motioned President Kenner , quoting a National Safety Council decision : " There is no evidence that deaf people can not drive safely ; therefore our only object is to determine whether they know how to do so .
