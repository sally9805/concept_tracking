For 22 years John L. Casey has led parties of New York school children through the State Museum in Albany 's State Education Building , faithfully explained the prehistoric skeletons and the lifelike reproductions of Cayuga and Mohawk tribesmen , in which interest is perennially strongest . Last week Guide Casey declared that he was thoroughly tired of modern moppets who lead him a romping chase through the exhibits , make sport of his educational efforts . Said he : " Kids are worse than they ever were . They used to play tag around the mastodons and the paleozoic fossils . Now they 're not content unless they carve their initials in the wood exhibits and the display cases . . . . I even used to try to figure out in advance what they were going to do and then try to prevent it . But do you think that helped ? Not a bit . Every move I made they were 30 seconds ahead of me . " Best-behaved , observed Guide Casey , are rural students . " I can pick them out every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to see everything and learn more than any of the others . "
