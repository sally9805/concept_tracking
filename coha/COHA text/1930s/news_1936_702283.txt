txt The theft from Federal court records of eighteen pages of names of stock and bondholders in the Francisco Sugar Company was disclosed today when an investigation by Federal authorities was ordered . The theft was suspected to be linked to the spectacular rise in bonds of the company following the ending of its receivership last week . The loss was revealed by Federal Judge Guy L. Fake when he directed that the matter be referred to United States Attorney John J. Quinn for investigation . At the same time it became known that the Federal equity receivership under which the company has been operating since Nov. 15 , 1933. was ended last Wednesday . The order ' ending the receivership had not been made public here . The theft was believed to have been committed in recent weeks . Neither Judge Fake nor any of the lawyers concerned in the receivership would comment publicly on it . Speculators Suspected Several of the lawyers said pri- ; vately , however , that the list of investors might have been used by speculators in connection with the expected rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " rigged " the ! market to delay the price rise while they induced the bondholders to sell outside the market at a small premium or to switch their holdings to other issues . The company had $2.880,000 in bonds outstanding , according to papers in the case , on a $5,000,000 issue maturing in 1942 , on which interest of 7% per cent had been in default . Bonds of $1.000 par value denomination sold this year on the domestic bond market at a low of $355 . By last week the market value rose to $1,280. and after a 10-point gain ' on the week the bonds sold for $1,380 . One of the principal attorneys in the case , however , said he saw no connection between the theft and the discharge from receivership . The lists were probably wanted by makers of " sucker lists " or lists of prospects for securities salesmen , he believed . He pointed out that it had been known for months that reorganization of the company would undoubtedly be approved . In Three Court Offices The papers have been in court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years , having been transferred about wherever they were needed . They were open to inspection by lawyers and other persons . But those inspecting them , including the thieves , had first to give the deputy clerk 11 in whose custody they were a legitimate reason for wishing to look at them . The stolen sheets included fifteen pages of names of bondholders and three of stockholders , all closely ' typewritten on legal size paper . They were clipped together inside a heavy batch of documents , forming part of the original pleadings on which the receivership was granted . An accountant interested in the company 's affairs looked over the papers last Friday . He found that a wad of sheets had been ripped from the batch of documents . Reporting the theft to Elmer Pettengill , deputy court clerk , he said he had looked at the papers recently and had observed that they were intact . Mr. Pettengill told Charles E. Jaeckel , another deputy , who reported the loss to Judge Fake . The company was incorporated in New Jersey in 1899 . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , produce cane sugar and molasses from plantations owned , leased or controlled in the Province of Camaguey , Cuba , where the two companies had in 1933 242,196 acres of land , some of which was planted in cane and where they operated two grinding mills , served by 179 miles of standard gauge railroad . At that time assets were reported as $12,699,141 . On Feb. 16 , 1933 , following the filing of a plea for the receivership , Manuel E. Rionda of Alpine , N. J. , vice president of the company , was appointed a receiver , as was Shelton Pitney of Morristown , N. J. Later Samuel Kaufman of Newark was also named a receiver . A reorganization plan was worked out last Summer . On Wednesday an order ending the receivership was signed by Judge Fake , who had approved the plan , and it was forwarded to Trenton and the company was returned to its officers and directors . Because the signing of the order was not made public at that time , there was a report that secrecy had i been sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that publicity might be used for purposes of speculation on the bond market . Today , however , all concerned in the case denied there had been any effort at ' secrecy . L. J. Rionda is president of the company , which has offices at 106 Wall Street , New York , and in Francisco , Province of Camaguey , Cuba .
