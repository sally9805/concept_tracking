In the House of Commons His Majesty 's Loyal Opposition have about 185 votes . Last week on the issue of Neville Chamberlain 's new foreign policy-rapprochement with Italy and Germany , the issue which caused Anthony Eden 's resignation ( TIME , Feb. 28 ) - the Opposition voted 167 strong against the Government . They won over to their side just one Conservative , Mr. Vyvyan Adams , an official of the British League of Nations Union . <P> But the opposition vote did not show the extent of the crisis . About 100 M. P.s who normally support the Government abstained from voting . Among them were Anthony Eden himself , Lord Cranborne ( Eden 's undersecretary who resigned with him ) and Eden 's prominent Conservative supporter , Winston Churchill . The Cabinet was finally upheld by a safe margin , 330-to-168 . <P> " Shocked , " " troubled , " " stunned , " " puzzled " were the adjectives used by the press in describing British reactions to the crisis . Popular , young ( 40 ) Anthony promptly went forth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall cheering , while an overflow meeting of 400 was arranged . <P> " Do I look like a sick man ? " asked Mr. Eden , in answer to rumors that his resignation had been caused by ill health . " I resigned because no other course was open to me ! His Majesty 's Government believe that their new policy , while risky , must ultimately succeed and must contribute to the peace of Europe . Unhappily I can not believe this-indeed I believe exactly the opposite-so how could I recommend such a course to the House of Commons ? If I had done so . I should have been a hypocrite . " <P> Repeating his accusation that Mussolini had told Britain she must enter negotiations " now or never , " Eden continued . " Is it to be ' an agreement , when you can get it , negotiated on a solid basis ' or is it to be ' an agreement , if you can get it , regardless of the basis ? ' " <P> But it soon became apparent that he intended not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within . Said the Conservative Party 's great idealist who may one day make a popular Prime Minister : " It is with the Great Democracies of Europe and America that our natural affinities must lie . We must stand by our conceptions of International Order , without which there can be no lasting peace . ... It is the duty of His Majesty 's Government at this time to be vigilant and to be firm . The decision is made . The Government must then go ahead . I most sincerely wish them success . " <P> Vigilant &; Firm . Meanwhile Grade A taunts were hurled at the Prime Minister in the House of Commons : <P> Lloyd George : " You have got rid of the one man in your Cabinet who would stand up to the Dictators ! " <P> Labor Back Benchers : " Resign ! Get out of it , you dirty dog ! " <P> Winston Churchill : " In the United States our many friends there are dismayed . The millions of our enemies there now are armed with this to mock us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as the people of the Continent-tarred with the same brush ! " <P> Herbert Morrison , Laborite " Mayor of London " : " Eden was stabbed in the back with an Italian stiletto ! "
