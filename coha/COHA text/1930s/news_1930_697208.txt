txt It was enough , a few years ago , for a woman to be gentle , a true wife , a wise mother and a good housekeeper . Now she is asked to add the instincts of a gentleman . If this seems an impudent or unreasonable request , let her consider that she has acquired many of a gentleman 's privileges , and that it is not a rude male but one of the leaders of her own sex who urges her to keep within the ancient boundaries established by men . Miss FRANCES PERKINS does not disapprove of smoking for women , but in her article in The New Republic on the fire hazards they are creating she speaks her mind on the bad manners of some of them . She is well aware that any social group is likely to flaunt a little when permitted to take over new customs . Few men have protested when the young lady at the dinner table strews it with cigarette ashes straight through the meal . They have wondered how she could destroy what little palate she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not tried to convert her to the pleasures of sensitive taste . Even if her manners allow her to scatter ashes in the butter , theirs prevent them from telling her that they prefer their butter plain . They may let her pick out their ties or shirts or socks , knowing that she will fill the shop with smoke and tantalize the sales , man , who is forbidden to indulge while on duty , but they do not feel it necessary to join her in smoking if they happen to accompany her to the haberdasher 's . She smokes everywhere  --  at quick-lunch cowl/ ters , in dining cars , theatre lobbies , art galleries , street cars and depart ' ment stores . Perhaps she should not be blamed too severely for turning the depart ' ment stores into fire hazards . The stores themselves catered to this habit . Miss PERKINS says that shoe departments started it . Those that have gone in for gleaming modernist furnishings have , placed strange twining ash receivers beside every I chair , and the woman who carries cigarettes must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while she tries on a dozen pairs of slippers . Fitting rooms where gowns are tried on are almost invariably supplied with smokers ' conveniences . The man who goes with his wife to buy a dress waits without smoking in the comparatively safe surroundings of the shop , while she , in the midst of swirling and highly inflammable draperies , drops glowing sparks wherever they chance to fall . Smoking has not been prohibited by the laws governing mercantile establishments because it has not heretofore been the custom to smoke there . Men 's freedom to smoke elsewhere , and the self-discipline that comes from convenient freedom , have kept them from lighting up in places which are women 's almost entirely . It is still unusual for women to smoke as they stroll along the street , and the department store that makes them feel welcome to come in and enjoy a cigarette probably picks up a little business from the casual smoker . However , the fire hazard pointed out by Miss PERKINS is a serious one . The danger from panic among crowds unorganized and uninformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
