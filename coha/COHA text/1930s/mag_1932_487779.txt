IF campaign financing were reported in terms of reality , the next report of the Republican National Treasurer might well contain the following item : " From the taxpayers of the United States , by the grace of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation , loans totaling $102,000,000 , to enable Hoover to carry California . " It is easy to place that interpretation on the loan of $40,000,000 extended by the R. F. C. to finance the construction of an aqueduct in the Los Angeles district , and it is difficult to place any other upon its subsequent advance of $62,000,000 to finance the erection of a bridge across San Francisco Bay . These two projects may be entirely meritorious , but circumstances indicate that the Administration was actuated by other considerations in granting the loans , especially the second one . If the purpose was to create jobs , why were the loans delayed until the eve of winter , and , incidentally , until the eve of the election ? If the purpose was to avert suffering , why was such an enormous proportion of the corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less from winter than almost any in the Union ? Perhaps the answers may be found in the public statements of Republican politicians and editors who were at the scene . William H. Crocker , former Republican National Committeeman for California and head of the . Crocker National Bank in San Francisco , is quoted as follows : Nobody but Mr. Hoover and Mr. Mills could have put that over . We would n't get any such consideration if anyone else was in the White House . Mr. Hoover has done this for us . Additional light is shed by the San Francisco Chronicle , a Republican newspaper , in a news story which makes this interesting disclosure : Secretary of the Treasury Ogden Mills , in San Francisco in the interest of President Hoover , added his weight to the funds application by personal messages to Washington this week . Commendation of the interest shown in the bridge project by President Hoover and members of his Administration , including Secretary Mills , who during his stay here last week urged quick action on the allocation of funds , was heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the foregoing , but the meaning seems plain enough . If I know anything about reporters , this one was trying in a polite way to say that when Mills turned up in San Francisco to make speeches for Hoover and Curtis , the local Republican bosses got him into a room and told him Hoover certainly would lose California unless Washington came through with that loan , whereupon the patriotic Secretary called up Washington and " turned on the heat . " Nice work , Ogden  --  unless the rest of the country happens to hear about it ! T HIS business of " turning . the tide " every time Mr. Hoover makes a speech is becoming very funny . No sooner had he delivered his address of acceptance than party publicists discovered that he had " turned the tide , " and that the " drift " would be increasingly toward the Republican ticket . Then came the Maine disaster . Presently , however , he went to Des Moines , and again it was disclosed that the tide had " turned . " The Literary Digest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I venture that it will be found , after Mr. Hoover 's appearance in Ohio , that the tide has " turned " once more . It does n't seem to stay turned . The evidence indicates that Hoover 's Des Moines speech was effective in one important direction : it effectively depressed the price of the dollar and American securities abroad and thus antagonized a large section of the financial interests which had been supporting Hoover . Wall Street is not alone in believing that the gold standard was never in peril , but that if it was , the less said about it the better . The known facts about the gold reserve and the emphatic testimony of Senators Glass and Hull are almost conclusive that the danger never existed and that the President is guilty of having made an alarmist statement with the sole object of furthering his own campaign . The country should be prepared for more tactics of this character . As election day draws nearer , and the shadow of defeat looms larger , I think the American public will be amazed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adventurers will resort in their desperate efforts to retain control of the federal government . This campaign has elements of obsession and delusion seldom encountered , and the consequences may be grave . HUS far Roosevelt has disclosed few of the qualities of superman . Yet as the ghastly story of the Insull mess unfolds , Democrats may well get on their knees and thank God that they did n't nominate Owen D. Young . The Insull story is the biggest news in the country  --  more impor-tant , in fact , than that of the Presidential campaign . Sup-pose Young had been nominated and suppose that , right in the middle of the campaign his name had been revealed as one of those comprising the " preferred list " of persons who were cut in on the various " good things " promoted by the Insulls ! Hoover would have been reelected without a strug-gle . Readers of this page are aware that this writer never succumbed to the Young myth . Hymns to his supposedly messianic traits always rang hollow to ears that had listened to the testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar with that record were not surprised when the Great Nonesuch was identified as a pet and beneficiary of the man who is now a fugitive from justice . Incidentally , that subject suggests another . Some Democrats are com-plaining that the National Broadcasting Company is giving Hoover the " breaks " on the air . It therefore seems perti-nent to ask what has become of the government 's anti-trust suit against the radio trust , which has been pending for many months but which for some reason has not come to trial . Is it possible that the suit is being held as a club until , the campaign is over ? Roosevelt should be reminded of this when , as President , he undertakes the task of revamping the Federal Radio Commission and choosing a new Attorney-General . Or , will he , too , fall under the Young spell ? * * * * * THOSE who agree , that nothing is more precious or re- . freshing than a good joke at the expense of priggishness will delight in an incident of the American Bar Association convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he denounced Congress , condemned the government for competing with private business , and criticized laymen for not joining with lawyers to remedy the evils of government . It is not necessary for me to dwell on the obvious fact that lawyers are responsible for most of the evils of government , or to emphasize that denunciation of Congress is nearly always accepted , by those who know the facts , as a sign of mental indolence . It chanced that another speaker on the program was the brilliant Joseph B. Eastman , member of the Interstate Commerce Commission  --  but a layman . With a manner that was all humility he took up the subject of holding companies , and spoke in part as follows : Under certain conditions , and properly limited and safeguarded , there may be a legitimate place for such corporations . But when instead of a reasonably simple corporate structure one finds a tangled maze of pyramided and interlacing companies , many of them strictly of the holding or dummy type , it requires no great amount of intelligence to know that some process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furthermore , the creator or architect of every such corporate labyrinth is bound to be some clever legal shark . . . . I suggest that disease is attacking the business , banking , and financial practices of this country , and is an important factor in our present troubles . . . . I suggest that the legal fraternity is largely responsible for these unhealthy and even poisonous conditions . I suggest that the essentials of sound practice with respect to the organization of corporations , the limitation of their powers , and the restrictions to be imposed upon them , have been thoroughly considered in the past , both in this country and in England , so that material for a discussion of this forgotten subject is readily available . I suggest finally that the American Bar Association furnishes a most appropriate forum for such discussion . Looking down upon the horror-stricken faces of the public utility lawyers who composed a large part of his audience , and suppressing even the semblance of a twinkle in either eye , the sardonic commissioner concluded with the humble observation that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as coming from a layman . " I CAN NOT refrain from one parting comment on Calvin Coolidge 's speech in Madison Square Garden . In a slurring allusion intended for Governor Roosevelt , little Calvin said that President Hoover " was never carried into political office by way of family influence . " Well , neither was Calvin Coolidge . He was carried into the Vice-Presidency because a weary and perspiring national convention stampeded in the mistaken belief that Coolidge had quelled the Boston police strike , and he was carried into the Presidency by the death of President Harding . Roosevelt probably will be carried there because the country is wet , broke , and disgusted .
