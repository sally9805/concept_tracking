SOUTH CLIFF A STORY BY CATHERINE DRINKER BOWEN AG GIE snapped the lock on the last suitcase . She went out of the room and , finding the chambermaid ( no use ringing bells in the Hotel Beau Rivage ) , told her they were ready for the moving . On the first of September the management collected all of its clients from the Beau Rivage and the Annex and moved them into their big new hotel a little farther up the beach . Aggie hurried along the deserted passageway . " Zack could n't call me deliberate if he had seen me do the packing this morning , " she said aloud . Nobody argued the point  --  one of the advantages of talking to oneself . As she stepped into the bedroom from the dark corridor her shoulders drew together slightly . The room was bare and bright , the beds disheveled . The little black bag with the medicine bottles sat in the middle of Zack 's bed where Aggie had put it for safety . It lookedllorrid , squatting there so plump and black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor with the other bags . Oh , well , she thought , all hotel bedrooms look dismal till you settle into them . When they were moving to a new place Aggie always packed Zack 's neckties on top , so she could take them out first : she would hang them over the bedstead or on the knob of the French windows  --  gay slashes of color , red stripes and yellow and blue and black . Neckties were the only extravagance Zack allowed himself . And he chose such daring ones  --  always the right kind of daring , though , with stripes that might be the colors of a polo club . But then , thought Aggie , Zack looks daring even in a black tie . Beau Brummel , Zack said , always wore a black cravat . Aggie wondered if Beau Brummel , when he was dressed and brushed and ready for the street , could possibly have looked as dashing as Zack . Impossible . No one could look as dashing as Zack , so lean , so tall and brown , with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graying at the temples  --  Aggie liked the phrase . She had used it that very morning in answer to her husband 's complaint that he was getting gray as an old college professor . " Why , no , dear , " she had said , " your gray hair is distinguished . You 're only graying at the temples . " Zack had laughed gloomily and told her she had a talent for cliches . " If I want to avoid cliches in my stories ; " he had said , " all I have to do is to keep you around , Aggie . You 're a perpetual warning . " Aggie spoke better French than Zack  --  the only thing she could do better than he , except practical things like sewing on buttons , which did n't count ; but she did not know what a cliche was . She looked it up after he had gone downstairs , but it was not in the pocket dictionary they carried with them . " Oh , well , " she thought , " I do n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zack . " She set the four suitcases neatly in a row and stood for a moment looking down at them : ZACHAILIALE SMITH stared at her four times . " Silly , solemn name , " thought Aggie , " for my Zack . " She went quickly out of the room and down three flights of rickety stairs to the hotel entrance , where she found the concierge , the proprietor , and two chasseurs in attitudes of expectant hovering . " Madame goes pik-nik ? " asked the concierge . Pik-nik , as all the days ? " " Yes , " Aggie replied in French . " We shall return at four . You may move our things to the Hotel Roches Blanches while we are gone . " She walked out the door amid a flurry of bows . But the bows did not deceive Aggie . She was not one to be taken in by bows . Ten per cent for service , it said on the bill . They could bow all morning as far as she was concerned . Her purse was locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the triple effervescent bromides and the pink tablets . When she thought of the tablets a little crinkle of fear ran down Aggie 's spine . She did n't like it , Zack 's taking hypnotics . Until this summer he had kept to bromides . Dope , those pink things ; Zack could say what he liked , and that smart-Alec English-speaking druggist could say what he liked  --  it was dope . When Zack got very bad at night and asked for one she always pretended she could not find them . She would get up and grope and stumble and risk all kinds of language from Zack . Not just swearing  --  nobody , thought Aggie , minds swearing  --  bat really bitter things , words and words , piling up , lashing at her , fantastic words , wild , extravagant words , crazy words , but not quite crazy enough to be foolish . They were true , these torrents of words ; that was the worst of it . 1 will not listen , I will not hear him , I will forget what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her white nightdress . In the end , she would find the tablets and give one to Zack with a drink of water . Nobody could go against Zack when he began thrashing round . She would creep into bed and turn out the light and wait for him . to stop talking . In about half an hour the pink tablet took effect . When he was asleep she would sit up and stare into the darkness , trying to see him , afraid to reach out her hand . No light at all came through the long heavy shutters . Zack liked the shutters closed , and indeed , if they had been open , Aggie thought she would have blown out of bed , so fierce were the early autumn winds and so near were they to the sea . The shutters would rattle and the awning over the balcony flap like a sail . Aggie came out of the hotel with her parcel of lunch and her pint bottle of Vichy and stepped quickly down the beach between the heavy black hulls of the fishing boats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why stay in the house and worry , when all one needs to stop worrying is to get out in the sun ? The sun and wind . " Aggie did not mind the wind in the daytime ; she liked it . She lifted her face to it now and let it pour about her . " Clean , salt clean , " she thought , " that 's what Normandy means . " Down to her left , past the dories and the fish nets drying in the sun , the women were kneeling on the pebbles , washing their linen in the fresh stream that ran down from under the rocks above . Sheets were spread to bleach , weighted down with stones . To the right the bathing cabins , red and blue and pink , ranged gaily against the sea wall , and below the cabins children ran and shouted , jumping over the slim little sea skiffs set out so neatly with their painted paddles lying beside them . Aggie looked at her watch ; it was ten o'clock . She need not start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same  --  as far as anything which concerned Zack was ever the same . You could do things with Zack over and over , day after day , and it would be always different , always exciting . Zack made it different ; he put a meaning into things . Aggie had tried to tell him , but be had pinched her and called her sentimental . At thirty , Aggie still invited pinching . - Do n't think , " he had added , " that I 'm making fun of you . I like sentimental women . All women should be sentimental . Especially wives . That is what they are for . " At eleven Aggie would climb the south cliff and walk along the moors until she found Zack . They would have lunch and sit together for a little and then she would leave him to finish his writing or his painting  --  he had " taken up " his painting again since the accident . Writing tired him , he said . She would kiss him and go off across the moors to the lighthouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lately , though , he had not even cared to paint , let alone write . He had just lain there when she left him , with his arms under his head , staring at the sky . It bothered her a little ; a person should not be idle for such long hours , especially a man . A person should at least keep up an appearance of industry ; she herself always carried a little sewing in her pocket . Of course men did n't sew or knit but they could at least pretend to read a book or go to sleep . Anything but to lie there and stare . This morning the tide was out . For a quarter of a mile the sea floor lay bare , shining with pools and slippery brown seaweed . Aggie decided to spend her hour poking about , looking for shells to take home to the children . Nieces , Zack 's nieces . Aggie had no children ; for a long time she had been very sorry for herself because Zack would not let her have babies . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But her husband had cured her of this . " Babies ! " he had said . " Faugh ! It 's the vulgarest of vanities , the desire for babies . " He had taught her to be above babies , and indeed it was a good thing he had . What would they do with babies now since the accident ? Zack had not got out a new book for three years ; that was n't long , of course , as books go , and they were not entirely dependent upon royalties for income , but even so , babies would complicate matters terribly . They could not go roaming about Europe with babies . They would have had to settle down at home in the suburbs somewhere . Pelham , perhaps . Zack would have died in Pelham . No , he would not have died , he would have walked off somewhere and left her with the babies . Since the accident he had had to give up his newspaper jobs and all the reviewing . Why , Aggie wondered sometimes , with the impatience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fencing foil through one 's eye shake a person all to pieces , shake a person 's courage all to pieces ? For that was all that ailed Zack . Lack of confidence , lack of courage . And yet his eye had healed ; it was not even scarred . The paralysis had got well too  --  Zack looked , if anything , handsomer than ever . But he ran away from people , he would not talk . Not even to shopkeepers and porters , let alone writers and clever people such as he had used to gather about him . " I 'm tired , " he would say . " I 'm tired . I 've got to be alone . I ca n't even have you , Aggie . There 's too much blood in you . I can feel you tingle . " She crossed the park ( ridiculous to call this reach of slimy sea floor " le pare d'Etretat " ) and climbing to a ridge on the cliff 's face , passed through a long dark cavern out to a dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She leaned against the iron rail ; far below the rocks reached toward her with fangs licked clean , but Aggie gazed down at them placidly . Zack was afraid of high places ; when he walked on the moors he kept well back from the cliff 's edge . She looked out beyond the great arched rocks  --  les elephants , they called them  --  to the sea . How blue it was , a deep September blue , a windy blue . The dories with their henna sails pitched and swung . It was so bright all round , with the sea and the sky and the white cliffs  --  it was almost terrihle . It was Zack who had taught her how terrible such brightness can be . She had always loved October days at home , with a northwest wind and the mountains all scarlet ; but when it was like that Zack would not go out . Even before the accident he would not go out . " It is too much , " he said . " It burns , it hurts , like walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed , " he had said , " on bright days than on rainy ones . " Aggie shook herself . What was wrong with her this morning , thinking about dying ? She climbed down the perpendicular ladder along the cliff 's face and ran across the beach , plunging among the smooth pebbles . The Vichy bottle and the lunch were wedged tightly in her basket ; as she began to ascend the goat path up to the moors the basket felt heavy . No use wondering what was in the parcel . It was always the same , a loaf of bread , cheese , grapes , hard-boiled eggs , and two kinds of cold meat , She hoped there would be veal to-day . Neither she nor Zack ate veal , but the oyster woman loved it . Aggie always made up a package of what was left and car-tied it hack to the old woman who sat all day on the beach before the hotel , selling oysters to be opened and eaten on the spot , with a dash of lemon . " Reconnu salubrc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pare d'Etretat . " Only they were n't from Is part d'Etretat at all , the old woman had told her with a leer . They came from Cherbourg , a day 's journey . Aggie paused to take off her sweater . In spite of the wind , she was hot . She pushed her brown beret off her damp forehead ; she must remember to straighten it before she met Zack . Zack hated women who wore their hats on the back of their beads . " It is a sign of being hardened in virtue , " he said . Nor would he permit Aggie to wear dark blue , dark-blue hats especially . " A woman must have had at least twenty lovers to be able to wear dark blue with style , " he told her . " Perhaps Ninon de l'Enclos could have done it , but it is a question . " It was not a question with Aggie ; she had never had any lover at all except Zack , not even an approach to one , unless , she thought , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zack had come along when she was twenty and carried her off from Aunt Fan and Pelham and had made ten years of glorious adventure out of what had once been merely twenty-four contented hours repeated round and round the clock . " Glorious adventure , " she repeated stoutly , even since the accident , with Zack not sleeping and being so fidgety and down on her every minute for something  --  even with him having those rages . After all , being raged at was better than being in Pelham . Being raged at was terrifying , especially when it happened in the middle of the night , but at least it gave you something to hold onto . To hold onto . Why , that was what Zack had said when she used to ask him , " But why me , dearest ? Why , when you could have had anybody on earth  --  me ? " " Because , " Zack had answered , " you were something to hold onto . " If she had been something to hold onto then , Aggie mused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was small and round and firm and fresh . Yes , fresh at thirty . In summer when she was tanned the blood glowed gypsy rich under her cheek . She had no " features , " but her teeth were white and her smile was quick . She walked firmly on her rope-soled espadrilles ; above the laces crossed about her ankles her leg swelled appreciably . Aggie knew she could never be really stylish no matter how Zack worked over her , because her legs were too fat . " Rot , " Zack would say , " I like a leg with a swell to it . " Madame Briane 's legs had n't had a swell to them , Aggie thought . She set her round little jaw and put Madame Briane from her . After all , it was three years since Madame Briane , and there had not been anybody since . " But why could n't she have called herself Bryan , " Aggie asked irritably for the thousandth time ; her last husband 's name was Bryan . In the end , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when at last it was over and the woman had gone away , Aggie had flung herself upon her husband , weeping . " Forgive me , Aggie , " Zack bad whispered , hugging her , patting her . " I hate the Briane . I hated her all the time . I hate all clever women . " Doubtful comfort in this . Aggie began to live in perpetual terror of more Madame Brianes . She never asked questions , but she developed an uncanny faculty for knowing where her man was and what he was about . " You 're beginning to surround me , " he told her . " You 're surrounding me and absorbing me , like a giant jellyfish with a helpless periwinkle . " Aggie wondered whether jellyfishes really ate periwinkles or whether it was just somemore of Zack 's nonsense . But she began to look forward to the time when Zack would be fifty-five and she forty-five . Then she could be sure of him ; he would belong to her . Maybe she had better say sixty and fifty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands . To fence masked like other people  --  but no , that would have been too safe , too un-Zacklike a gesture . He had become hers by virtue of that very foolhardiness she had once feared would take him from her . That young fencer ? Harry Mimed his name was  --  had given her husband to her . Yes , given him to her . Zack was hers now , Aggie thought with a quick thrill of triumph , stepping clear of the steep path onto the welcome green of the moors . He needed her ; try as he would , he could never escape her now . She might even have to get out and be family breadwinner if he did n't start writing again pretty soon . He had said so himself only this morning , said it without smiling . She would n't mind , she would like it . No , Zack could n't escape her now . Not even up here on the moors , she thought , pausing to breathe . She knew exactly where he had gone and where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass and looked northward down the green valley to Etretat . Clouds had come up against the wind , their shadows moved across the soft undulation of the hills . Down in the hollow lay the town , its blue-slate roofs clean and sharp in the sun . And north of the town at the water 's edge the cliffs rose sheer and white , sweeping landward in green turf patched with stubble . The hill 's summit was treeless and bare save for the little white church with its absurd steeple . Like a toy church , Aggie thought , a Noah 's Ark church . In the steeple the bell was ringing for mass ; how pretty it sounded . She wondered if Zack could hear it a mile farther on where he was waiting . She thought it a little absurd , the way the bell was always ringing for mass . She had been intensely , protestantly religious before her marriage , but nobody could be a psalm singer living with Zack . He did not believe in anything at all , and yet he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people need a church on a hill , " he had said gravely . " They need masses . And incense , plenty of incense , to forget for a while the strong breath of the sea . " Aggie lay on her stomach , her chin in her hands , gazing down across the golf course . After the dazzling brightness of the beach and the sea below , the green of the golf course was a miracle . It smoothed one 's eyebrows down . The reason it was so green , even now at the end of summer , was because it rained so much up here in Normandy . It would probably rain to-night , Aggie thought , looking at the sky , where the clouds were rolling up darkly from the east . Well , she did n't care if it rained for days . She would have Zack all to herself then , in their bedroom . There was nowhere else to go when it rained ; Zack hated bridge and the Casino . She rose and strolled southward along the cliff 's edge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne 's lace , shivering and tossing among the high grasses , heather , and thistles . Such fat thistles , a deep strong purple , standing up spikily on their short stems . The grass was sprinkled with little flowers . There were yellow flowers like dandelions and a flower like a buttercup and still another like a tiny yellow sweet pea . She picked one of each and put them in her basket ; she would take them to the hotel and ask the concierge their names in French , and then she could look them up in the dictionary . She would not ask Zack . She had long ago given up asking Zack the namesof things , ever since he told her the story about the man and the star . " There was a man once , " he had said . . . " This is n't my own , Aggie . . . and when he looked up and saw a star he had n't seen before he would ask , ' What star is that ? ' And they would tell him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that he had learned something . " Aggie had gone perhaps half a mile before she found Zack 's first signal , an empty Vichy bottle with a thistle in the top . He always carried two pint bottles with him , and as he emptied each bottle he would leave it as a sign for her . It was a kind of game . This one was standing on the fence post to the left of the path , between Aggie and the golf course . It wobbled drunkenly in the wind ; she wondered it had not blown off , or that the thistle had not fallen out . She smiled ; it was like Zack never to forget the thistle . " To show which way I 've gone , " he had explained . There would be one more , and then she would find him . In another week , she thought , the thistles will be seeding ; already they were fading , here and there a soft mauve fluff floated above the long grass . Zack would have to change his signal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatly in the grassy ditch went on , still thinking about the man and the star . " But I like things better , " she told herself , " when I know their names . They belong to me then . " Zack could look in shop windows at beautiful things , old china , brocades , bronzes , jewels , things to eat , even , like the baskets of candied fruit at Le Grecques , and enjoy them just standing there . Afterward he would talk about them . " Remember the Chinese rug we saw at Harouk 's ? You could feel the texture of it right through the window . " He never seemed to care whom things belonged to if he could look at them . When Aggie saw a beautiful thing she wanted it for her own . If it was smooth , like a crystal ball , a porcelain cup , her fingers crawled . to touch it . And she would , when possible , pick the object up and turn it over , rubbing it with her finger tips . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ca n't you enjoy old ivory without holding it in your hand ? " Aggie was ashamed ; why had she not Zack 's fineness of perception ? She was perpetually offending him by her grossness . She had come now to the end of the golf course . Zack must have turned here , she thought , and gone down over the cow pasture to the lighthouse . He must have been feeling extra strong today to walk so far . Usually they sat here in the grassy hollow by the fence corner and ate their lunch . Aggie looked along the fence for the second Vichy bottle , but it was not there . She glanced at her watch . Five minutes to twelve . She was provoked . Now she would be late , she who loved to be punctual . Not that Zack would notice if she were two hours late . He had no watch anyway ; he had smashed it three nights ago in a paroxysm of blind fury over nothing at all , had flung it deliberately on the bare floor of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashamed , his face had lighted up as Aggie had not seen it in months , and he had turned quickly to the mirror  --  a trick of his at emotional moments . It made Aggie slightly uncomfortable always when he did this . It was not quite , well whatcould he expect to find there , anyway ? People 's faces were just their faces , year in and year out . This time at what he saw the light had gone out of his eyes and his mouth resumed its tight , tortured look . Aggie sat down abruptly on the grass . Zack must have gone off somewhere to rest for a few minutes , away from the path and the possibility of being greeted by a passerby . He might come back , and she would miss him . She would wait for five minutes and then go on toward the lighthouse . She loved it here . It was the highest point along the cliffs . The drop down was breath taking . She wondered how many feet it was to where the surf pounded on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind was dying now , and the roar of the sea came to her very harsh and heavy ; the hills were all in shadow , although to the west the sea had not lost its brightness . It will surely rain before night , she thought . There drifted to her the scent of mustard blossom , incredibly sweet ; she turned her face to it and saw the flowers , greenly golden , wave upon wave of light blowing along the field . Clover , too ? . Zack loved the clover fields ; he would stand and sniff at them like a colt . Hugging her knees with her brown arms she gazed along the grass to where its swaying needle ends broke the smooth blue circle of the horizon . If Zack should come along and find her sitting so near the edge he would not like it ; in a moment , she thought , she would move back . Suddenly , without turning her head , she became aware of a small object to her left , standing up motionless , outlined against the blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it was not a rabbit . She got up and walked toward it , but she did not look at it . At the edge of the cliff , with a great effort , an effort which wrenched her very heart from her body , she turned her face down and looked . It was an empty Vichy bottle , with a purple thistle in the top .
