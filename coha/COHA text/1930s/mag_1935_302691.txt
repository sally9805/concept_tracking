As is its longtime custom during the first week of every year , the Press last week printed a batch of 1935 prophecies from U. S. Businessmen . Newsreaders with memories long enough to recall similar predictions made on New Year 's Day 1930 or 1931 or 1932 scanned last week 's output with thoughtful amusement . <P> ' The peak of the Depression passed 30 days ago , " said James Augustine Farrell of U. S. Steel Corp . in January 1931 . Same week Owen D. Young declared that the " dead centre " of Depression had come &; gone . <P> Last week there were 5,000,000 heads-of-families on the dole . <P> In 1931 Secretary of Commerce Robert Patterson Lament declared : " . . . The banks of the country generally are in a strong position . " <P> On Jan. 1 , 1931 there were 22,092 banks . <P> Last week there were 6,554 fewer . <P> In 1930 President Edward Eugene Loomis of Lehigh Valley R. R. said : ' ' The high plane of railroad performance today is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business finds itself . . . . " <P> Today one-fifth of all the railroad mileage in the U. S. is in receivership . To keep afloat , railroads have borrowed nearly half a billion dollars from the U. S. Government . <P> In 1931 Chairman Alexander Legge of the Federal Farm Board predicted : " There is no further general decline in commodity prices in sight . " <P> In 1931 wheat dropped to its lowest price ( 45 per bu. ) on any primary world market in 300 years . <P> In 1930 President John Marcus Davis of Delaware , Lackawanna &; Western Ry. declared : " Few if any people will stop eating , wearing clothes , postpone getting married or change their habits , just because the stock market took a tumble . . . . " <P> The following year 20,160 people jumped out of windows , shot themselves , turned on the gas , or swigged poison-highest suicide rate recorded since 1912 . <P> Last week 's crop of prophecies was the shortest in years . Five years of defeat , frustration and ridicule had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmless forecasts about their own industries . Samples : <P> " The outlook for the steel industry is reasonably favorable. " - Tom Girdler of Republic Steel . <P> " We look forward to continued improvement . " - Gerard Swope of General Electric . <P> " Conditions in 1935 should be somewhat better . " - Alfred P. Sloan of General Motors . <P> This time there was justification for an undercurrent of hope : electric power production and steel ingot production were up , automobile prospects were rosy ( see p. 62 ) . But the New York Times , which has practically ceased gathering New Year forecasts from businessmen , commented : ' ' Never before within the memory of Wall Street veterans have prophetic efforts been so lightly regarded .
