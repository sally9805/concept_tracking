Mr. George Parmly Day , the treasurer of Yale , expects to pay part of the university 's expenses from unexpected legacies . He was therefore both surprised and not surprised when he picked up his paper one morning last week and learned that a rich old gentleman who had never shown any interest in the university 's management and who had not been in New Haven in six years had left Yale some $1,800,000 . <P> Donor of Yale 's windfall was Edward Benedict Cobb , a typical , obscure , sentimental old grad . Inheriting nearly $3,000,000 from his family ( who had owned 300 acres in the heart of Tarrytown . N. Y. since Revolutionary times ) , Benedict Cobb went to Yale in 1868 , played on his class chess team , made Psi Upsilon , was elected a class officer in his senior year . After his graduation in 1872 , he got a law degree at Columbia and practiced law in Manhattan for twelve years . At 38 , bored with the law , he retired and married a Yaleman 's sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law but also by society , music , art , outdoor sports and the movies , Benedict Cobb spent each summer quietly in Pittsfield , Mass. , each autumn in Boston , each winter in Washington , each spring abroad . He seldom visited Tarrytown , his birthplace . But for some 60 years he went back often to New Haven for football games and alumni affairs . So modest , however , that he never posed for a photograph , Benedict Cobb was known to few Yalemen , was quickly forgotten when he dropped out of alumni activities in 1932 . <P> Tall , haughty and always immaculately dressed , wearing a white mustache and a wing collar , Benedict Cobb spent much of his time after his wife died in 1929 taking long daily walks with his nurse , Miss Miriam M. Caldwell , a vivacious Virginian . In a Pittsfield hotel last Thanksgiving Day , at 89 , he died . In his will , announced last week , childless Benedict Cobb , last of his family , left $250,000 to his nurse , $450,000 to hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got $400,000 of that and an estimated $1,400,000 in his residuary estate . <P> Chief sources of Yale 's visible wealth , immortalized in such forms as its Gothic buildings and great research projects , are huge U. S. fortunes ( e. g . Harkness , Rockefeller ) . But the bulk of Yale 's endowment , like that of many another U. S. college , * comes from the gifts of sentimental old grads like Edward Benedict Cobb . <P> <P> * New York City College 's Dr. Ernest Victor Hollis , author of Philanthropic Foundations and Higher Education ( Columbia University Press ) told eastern university business officers in Pittsburgh this week that the trend is toward a broader base of college support . Most colleges , if they are to survive , said he , will in future have to depend on 1 ) tax funds or 2 ) numerous modest gifts from tax-evaders.
