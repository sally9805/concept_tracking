txt Government ownership and operation of the American merchant marine is favored by the New York Maritime Council in a report to Congress made public here today . The council reviews the position of the merchant marine under the present system of direct subsidies , under Government ownership and private operation , and , lastly , under Government ownership and operation . " In the light of the apparent intention of certain operators not only to continue to use the merchant marine as a syphon for draining public funds intended for more honest use , but to enlarge the syphon and accelerate the process , " the council says with regard to the first point , " we see no excuse for further ** of this proposal by Congress or the " Atnerican people . " The second proposal also is turned down by the council . " We see in this proposal nothing more or less than a method for opening the front doors of the United States treasury to a group of interests not content with access to the back door , " it continues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subterfuge agreed to for the purpose of sugar-coating , for public consumption , the supposedly bitter pill of outright public ownership . " At first glance , it adds , the third proposal for Government ownership and operation , would shiver " one of last resbrt , " to fall back upon in case the public was unwilling to accept the " reform measures " suggested in the first two points .

Private management in these fields has long ago been abandoned in the public interest . " The safeguards proposed by tile maritime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the council to be inadequate to protect the public interest .
