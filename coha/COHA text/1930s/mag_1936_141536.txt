This week that intrepid transatlantic exhibitionist , Crooner Harry Richman , and his pilot . Dick Merrill , headed back across the ocean from England to the U. S. , ran out of gas over Newfoundland , plopped into a bog with slight damages to plane and flyers . Few days before , two really important transatlantic flights had been accomplished with much more efficiency and much less ballyhoo by Germany 's Lufthansa . <P> In 1929 Germany 's No. 1 airline started catapulting ship-to-shore airplanes from the Bremen and Europa . Since February 1934 , Lufthansa has been running a regular weekly airplane mail service across the South Atlantic , using a catapult ship anchored off either shore . By last week Lufthansa was ready to tackle the more formidable North Atlantic on the experimental co-operative basis arranged with the U. S. and Pan American Airways last winter ( TIME , Feb. 24 ) . <P> To Horta in the Azores , some 500 miles off Lisbon , sped the mothership Schwabenland . Aboard were the world 's most powerful catapult and two sleek new Dornier all-metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sponsons , powered by two Junkers Diesel engines in tandem on the wing-top , they weigh ten tons , have a cruising speed of 135 m.p.h . Anchoring 100 miles off Horta , the Schwabenland prepared to send one plane non-stop to New York , the other to Bermuda , then to New York . Reason the start was from the Azores is that Lufthansa regards the flight there from Germany as child 's play . The planes are catapulted so they might take off with a greater load than they could lift from the water . <P> First away was the Aeolus , bound for Bermuda . After 60 miles it turned back with trouble in the air-cooling system . Same evening the Zephir shot away , uneventfully buzzed the 2,390 miles to Pan American 's Long Island base at Manhasset Bay . With four men aboard , the silver and yellow flying boat covered the route in 22 hours , using Pan American 's radio as a guidepost . Shrugged Ruddy Captain Joachim Blankenburg : " A routine flight . . . an everyday event . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything the ocean could offer in the way of weather . " <P> Two days later , in dropped the Aeohis , having made the 2,063 miles to Bermuda in 18 hours , the 770 miles on to Manhasset in six . Both planes tied up to await the arrival of the Schwabenland this week when they will be catapulted away for the return flights . <P> Significance of last week 's flights was that they thoroughly proved that transatlantic airplane service is feasible . Probably by next spring , say the Germans , regular flights will commence , but only to carry mail and express . For transoceanic passenger flights , Germany puts its trust in dirigibles like the Hindenburg which during the past summer made ten round trips between Frankfort and Lakehurst without a hitch.
