As a form of gambling , betting on a horse race is less expensive than the stockmarket , healthier than playing cards , less brutal than bearbaiting , more spectacular than roulette . Largely because of these advantages , horse racing has long seemed a particularly pernicious sport to those who consider all gambling immoral . At the turn of the Century there started a wave of earnest reform to curtail gambling by putting a stop to racetrack betting . Typical was the history of the reform in New York , where there has generally been more horse racing than anywhere else in the U. S. <P> From 1894 to 1908 , betting on New York horse races was legal under State law . In 1908 Charles Evans Hughes as a reform Governor outlawed racetrack bets with a statute which also denied betters the right to sue to collect winnings . By 1912 , since racing can not flourish without gambling , a turf track on the golf course of Long Island 's Piping Rock Club was the only one functioning in the State . Year later a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was legal for betters to deposit money with a bookmaker before the day 's racing , bet against it by marking paper slips during the races , collect whatever was left after the races . That left only the exchange of cash at the track during the races prohibited . With " oral " betting tolerated , horse racing again began to flourish in New York . <P> Depression wilted attendance at the racetracks throughout the State to such an extent that last year they lost $250,000 . The New York Legislature went to their rescue last month , less to shore up a sagging sport than to provide the State with a new source of tax revenue . Last week , Governor Lehman signed a bill which pulled the remaining teeth out of the Hughes anti-betting law by permitting money to change hands at the track and betters to sue for their winnings . <P> Two days later , when the racing season in New York opened at Jamaica , L.

A onetime program salesman at New York tracks , then a vendor of bookmakers ' sheets , he organized the Metropolitan Turf Association ( bookmakers union ) before 1900 . During the interim of oral betting , ' " Ringmaster " Cavanagh functioned as unofficial arbiter for a group of New York bookmakers . <P> Each layer last week had to employ a clerk to register bets , a cashier to pay winners , a runner to carry wagers from the clubhouse . To belong to the betting ring was expected to cost about $90 a day . Total bets on the opening day , in which the feature race was the Paumonok Handicap which Sgt. Byrne won at odds of 3-to-1 , amounted to $500,000 .
