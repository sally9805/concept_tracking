txt Type of financing program to be adopted by the American Telephone &; Telegraph System during the current year is undecided and subject to developments between now and the time for its undertaking . This was indicated 3 esterday by Walter S. Gifford , president of A. T. &; T. , during a discussion before the annual meeting of stockholders at which he presented a roundup of current results of operations in conjunction with a summary of the 1938 experiences . Highlighting Mr. Gifford 's remarks were statements to the effect that : The company currently is earning its dividend ; Plant expenditures in 1939 will amount to $320,000.000 or $35.000,000 more than in 1938 : A continued gain has been shown in telephones to date in April . The company holds a cautious attitude toward competitive bidding for its issues . Financing of Paramount Interest The prospects for financing this year by the country 's largest service organization has been an outstanding topic of financial discussion for several months . That security holders share in this interest also was evidenced at the meeting by the attention directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question as to whether the company contemplated any financing this year . " We have no plans at the moment for financing this year . " Mr. Gifford said . " We have two or three methods by which we might finance , but no final decision has been made . " Pointing out that the company would not need much money this year , Mr. Gifford estimated that A. T. &; T. would have $56,000.000 in cash at the end hf the year without financing . As alternatives he said " we may merely finance by having some of the subsidiaries pay off obligations to us , or we may do some financing our own . " It was indicated also that the 1939 construction requirements might have a bearing on the ultimate financing program . May Have to Spend More " If the company 's rate of growth keeps up , " Mr. Gifford said , " and we hope it will , sometime we will have to increase that volume of plant expenditures 15320.000.000 for 1939 ) , but for the moment it is at the rate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business we are getting . " Reporting a gain of 34,000 ' phones during the first two weeks of April . compared with 14.000 a year ago , Mr. Gifford at the same time explained that the company was currently earning the dividend . He forecast a 89,000,000 increase in taxes and asserted that if taxes today were relatively the same as in 1935. current earnings would be between $2 and $3 a share greater than they are . The competitive bidding bogey crept into the telephone meeting.as it has in the meetings this year of most large public utilities . It came in the form of a suggestion by a stockholder that if subsidiary companies planned any financing , their issues be offered " to open competitive bidding and thereby save millions of dollars , and also that these issues be offered to insurance companies and save money . " Sales to insurance companies . Mr. Gifford retorted , were not new to A. T. &; T. , but the difficulty was that if the system is going to raise large sums " which we have to in the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to have a market We have to have people who are generally public buyers of bonds , or we ca n't do it " Would Avoid Risk Admitting an open mind on competitive bidding , Mr. Gifford nevertheless hinted that he would rather have other companies be the guinea pigs and not the A. T. &; T. system . -I do not want the risk involved in view of the success we have had on the other basis . I would like to do some more thinking and some more watching to see where we could get on it before we take the responsibility of running a chance . " Competitive bidding . Mr. Gifford said , is " a very complicated matter and it has lots of things to be said for it on both sides . My feeling is that the proof of the pudding is in the eating , and the record which we have made without competitive bidding is an extraordinary record of achievement . Whether we could have done as well on competitive bidding or not . I do n't ' know , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some companies which do not have to constantly finance try out this competitive bidding on a big scale and let us see whether it works . " It is of interest , he said , that currently residence telephones have been showing somewhat larger gains , relatively speaking , than business telephones .  - -  The number of toll and long distance messages . Mr. Gifford said , is running well ahead of like months of last year , and while not yet equal to the peak period of 1930 , is slightly above the same months of 1937 , which was the best year since 1930 . At the present time . Mr. Gifford said , the system has approximately 16.000,000 telephones in service . a record high . This is some 800. - 000 telephones more than the pre-depression peak in 2930 , which was not reached again until October , 1937 The gain in telephones over 1930 , Mr. Gifford explained . varies in different sections of the country . Practically all sections , however , he said , show some gain , except the northeastern section which stall has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes about as poor a showing as anywhere , he added , there being 185,000 less telephones here than in 1930 . The greater gain over 1930 has occurred in the southeast followed closely by the Pacific Coast and the Rocky Mountain states . While it is gratifying , Mr. Gifford continued , that the absolute number of telephones is at a new peak , the number of telephones per 100 of population for the country as a whole is still slightly lower than in 1930. although in the southeast , Pacific and Rocky Mountain sections it is higher than in 1930 . " Our current rate of growth is encouraging , " he said . Mr. Gifford said many firms in addition to " usual statements of earnings and expenses . point out the percentages of revenue that go for wages , taxes , materials and supplies . interest and dividends , etc . It happens that our annual report for 1911 stated these - figures in a chart that showed that 50% of revenue went to employes , 5% for taxes , 20% for materials , rents , etc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twenty-seven years later the corresponding figures as shown in the annual report for 1938 were 49% to employes 14% for taxes , 18% for materials , rents , etc. , and 19% for interest and dividends and nothing for surplus . You will note that the only large differences between now and 27 years ago are in taxes and surplus . - Then 5% went for taxes and 6% was left for surplus . Now 14% goes for taxes and there is nothing left for surplus . "
