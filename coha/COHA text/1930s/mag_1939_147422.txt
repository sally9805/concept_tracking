When the New Deal , tackling Depression , launched NRA , WPA , PWA , AAA , a host of new officials turned up in Washington to tackle new jobs . Last week the vanguard of a new host appeared to tackle the problem of a world at war . <P> New men for new jobs , new jobs for old hands abounded , as Franklin Roosevelt began to make over his Government to wartime specifications . Changes extended from the Cabinet ( see p. 9 ) down to bureaus where the urgencies of peace-in-war abruptly supplanted the routines of peace . Great was the demand for lean fellows , hungry for action . Under the new faces which went to Washington appeared hardly a single paunch . <P> The Treasury in time of Neutrality is a fiscal balance wheel , an enforcement agency of the first magnitude . Its Secretary Henry Morgenthau scurried home from vacation ( in Scandinavia ) by cutter to St. John 's , Newfoundland , from there to Washington by plane , dashed to his office at 4 a.m . Within 48 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1 ) competent , stable businessmen , 2 ) economists who comb their hair . <P> To be Assistant to the Secretary ( at $10,000 a year ) in charge of Neutrality operations having to do with shipping , tall , knife-nosed , wealthy Basil Harris quit his vice-presidency of U. S. Lines in Manhattan . The better to watch over U. S. ports , he also became Commissioner of Customs , succeeding venerable ( 80 ) , goateed James Henry Moyle of Utah . Spry Mr. Moyle during part of World War I was an Assistant Secretary . Last week he was gently upped to Assistant again , temporarily without portfolio . <P> A new job called Assistant Secretary Herbert Gaston : to coordinate the activities of Treasury 's 10,578 Coast Guardsmen , 750 Customs agents , 250 Secret Service men , 250 income-tax inspectors , 1,250 alcohol inspectors . Tall , worn Mr. Gaston is an ex-newspaperman who lost out at 50 ( when the old New York World expired ) , came back as Henry Morgenthau 's trusted man Friday . Because he clamped down on departmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ribald , nude-daubed Treasury press room . But columnists and other " think piece " composers who value the long view applaud his emergence as Treasury No. 3 man ( No. 2 : Under Secretary John Hanes ) . <P> Herbert Gaston 's chief job within a job is to direct the Coast Guard on peace patrol . Along with the Navy ( which last week began to recommission 116 ancient destroyers for patrol ) , the Coast Guard will range the Atlantic Coast and 200 miles at sea . <P> " I 'm just trying to be forehanded , " Henry Morgenthau explained , as he made an announcement that wakened memories of 1917 : the appointment of the first dollar-a-year-men of World War II . They were three bankers : able , affable Tom K. Smith , 57 , of St. Louis , a distinguished veteran of the Liberty Loan campaigns in 1917-19 , who in 1939 is to be " a sort of coordinator of all banking problems for the Treasury " ; Warren Randolph Burgess , 50 , of Manhattan 's National City Bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty last week as an expert on Government financing ; shining-eyed Earle Bailie , 48 , of J. W. Seligman &; Co. , drafted to gauge war 's effects on international exchange .
