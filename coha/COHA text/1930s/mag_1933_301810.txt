" The Vice President of the United States and members of the Senate , " cried Doorkeeper Joseph J. Sinnott of the House of Representatives shortly after noon one day last week . The House rose . Through the door , down the centre aisle strode Charles Curtis , erect and grim , accompanied by the Senate 's Secretary Edwin Pope Thayer . Behind them marched two small page boys bearing two large boxes of highly-polished mahogany . Behind boys &; boxes came 90 members of the Senate , advancing to the three front rows of Chamber seats . <P> Vice President Curtis stepped smartly up on the high rostrum . Speaker Garner handed over his gavel , sat down at the Vice President 's left . The Congress of the United States , thus in joint session assembled , shuffled and murmured . The Vice President of the United States rapped , called for order . " Mr. Speaker and gentlemen of the Congress . . . " he began huskily . To the desk below the rostrum advanced at his command Senators King of Utah and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts and Jeffers of Alabama in business suits . <P> Mr. Curtis fumbled a moment with some keys , opened the mahogany boxes . Drawing out an envelope , he ripped it open , handed the contents to Representative Jeffers . Mr. Jeffers cleared his throat , read solemnly : " Mr. President , the certificate of the electoral vote of the State of Alabama seems to be regular in form and authentic , and it appears therefrom that Franklin Delano Roosevelt , of the State of New York , received 11 votes for President , and John Nance Garner , of the State of Texas , received 11 votes for Vice President . " The sound of the Curtis gavel was lost in a storm of Democratic applause and laughter . <P> The counting continued . Arizona , Arkansas , California , Colorado all " appeared " to have cast their votes for Roosevelt &; Garner . Then came Connecticut : " . . . and Charles Curtis of the State of Kansas , received 8 votes for Vice President . " The Congress leaped to its feet , clapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curtis grinned , went on with the counting . <P> When Wyoming 's three votes had been announced , the Vice President of the United States declared that 266 votes were necessary for a majority , that the Democratic candidates had received 472 . <P> Thus last week by means of a solemn Constitutional anachronism were Franklin Delano ( " Frank " ) Roosevelt and John Nance ( " Jack " ) Garner finally and officially elected President and Vice President of the U.S.
