An experiment of bringing up an infant ape under identical conditions with a human infant was reported in outline last year by Winthrop Niles Kellogg , associate professor of psychology at Indiana University ( TIME , May 23 , 1932 ) . Last week Dr. Kellogg , with his wife collaborating , detailed in a book their curious stunt , the fun and trouble they had . <P> Professor Kellogg conceived the experiment when he was at Columbia University , six years ago . After he secured his Indiana post and other psychologists applauded the idea , the Kelloggs agreed to have a baby to companion an ape . Their boy , Donald , was born Aug. 31 , 1930 . His parents at first wanted to take him to Sumatra to find a foster brother or sister among the orangutans . But they lacked the money . No U. S. zoo would loan them an infant ape . The Kelloggs felt frustrated until Professor Robert Mearns Yerkes , Yale 's ape expert , offered to loan them Gua , 7-month-old , tan-faced , brown-eyed , black-haired female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosalie Abreu 's ape colony at Havana . The Kelloggs took a bungalow close to the Yale Anthropoid Experiment Station at Orange Park , Fla. and thereafter Gua and Donald , who was 10 months old , lived precisely similar lives . <P> From 7:00 a. m. to 6:30 p. m. the Kelloggs were incessantly occupied with the children , dressing , feeding and cuddling them . Daily it was necessary to weigh , measure , test , photograph , observe and teach them . Gua could not learn to speak human words , although she has the necessary apparatus and tried to use it . Nearest she came to a word was to pout her lips in effort to say " Papa . " <P> Gua learned to walk upright more quickly than did Donald . Although both had walking carts to aid them , Gua used hers only for play . She preferred to proceed by hanging on to Professor Kellogg 's trousers , walking between his legs . When Donald tried to imitate her in this form of walking , he , being taller , kept bumping his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect step with Professor Kellogg , unless he went too fast . In that case she would make skipping hops until in step again . <P> Gua liked to pull at every kind of hanging-curtains , table cloths , ropes , visitors ' skirts . She recognized people by their clothes better than by their faces , by the smell of their chests and arm pits better than by their clothes . Donald recognized faces readily . Gua was fond of poking her fingers in people 's mouths . Donald liked to tweak noses . <P> Gua taught Donald to bite walls and people , and to peek under doors . Gua 's many teeth were blunt and so hurt less than Donald 's few . Gua hated perfume and asafetida ; Donald liked perfume . Both reacted similarly to sweet , salty and bitter substances . Gua , however , liked sour things . Gua was more ticklish than Donald , frequently tickled herself for pleasure . Gua was first to recognize herself in a mirror , first to show interest in the pictures in a book .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
