ON THE morning of Wednesday , August 31 , 1932 , I noticed that the signal station at Nassau was flying advisory storm warnings , indicating that the center of the storm was expected to pass close by . I had arranged to take passage on the following day for Abaco Island , one of the Bahamas , in the Diesel mail boat Priscilla and , thinking that possibly her sailing would be delayed because of the storm , I went to the local meteorological station to find out more about it . The report from the Hydrographic Office in Washington said that there was a tropical hurricane centered in the general vicinity of Turks Island , moving slowly , with increasing intensity , toward the northwest . Obviously , unless it changed its course , it would pass through the Bahamas . The weather on this day , however , was fine and clear with a gentle easterly breeze and a normal , steady barometer . The storm was still much too far away to show any effects in Nassau . Throughout the following day ? Thursday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been for the past week . However , the local meteorological station received continued warnings from Washington that a hurricane was still moving in the direction of the Bahamas with increasing intensity . The storm warnings were still being displayed , and the people had started battening up their doors and windows . Bay Street , the principal thoroughfare of Nassau , preseated a strange sight with all the shop windows boarded up and shutters nailed fast . Captain Roberts of the Priscilla apparently thought there was no danger of the hurricane for at least another twenty-four hours , and accordingly we sailed for Abaco Island at 7:00 P.m . As Abaco lies due north from Nassau , we were moving away from the approaching storm about as fast as it was moving . I can remember Captain Roberts saying to me that evening that if we were going to have a hurricane he would a great deal rather ride it out at Green Turtle Cay , Abaco , where he had special moorings , and a much better anchorage than in Nassau harbor . We had a most uneventful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made five other stops before reaching Green Turtle Cay , which was my destination ; and this took all the following day , Friday , Sept. 2 . We lay over that night at a place called Marsh Harbour , where we again received news of the hurricane by wireless . It apparently was expected to strike the Bahamas on Sunday , Sept. 4th , but I must say nobody seemed to be worrying much about it any more . All the Priscilla 's crew lived at Green Turtle Cay and they seemed more interested in the prospect of getting home early the next morning than in the approaching hurricane . Had these poor fellows been able to look into the future and see the condition of their homes and families on the following Monday , we should certainly not have been such a light-hearted crowd as we were that evening . At ten o'clock the following morning ? Saturday , Sept. 3 ? the Priscilla came to anchor at Green Turtle Cay . This little settlement has a population of about five hundred people . Seventy-five years ago it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some three thousand inhabitants ; it was then the center of the sisal and pineapple plantations and was the port through which these products were shipped out of the Colony . As these industries declined , Green Turtle Cay also declined ; now the people make their living by sponging , fishing , and growing fruit on a small scale . They are all sailors ; in fact they are the finest sailors I have ever seen . They are white ; Abaco Island is the only one of the Bahamas on which whites predominate . The only reminders of the former prosperity of this little settlement , when I saw it last September , were the huge Cathedral and other big buildings , mostly unoccupied ; many of them were three stories high , built out of stone , which used to be quarried here on the Cay . The day of my arrival , which was Saturday , Sept. 3rd , I spent almost entirely with Basil Lowe , a fine fellow who used to be in the shark-fishing business . We sat round all day and talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great detail , as I was thinking of going into it . The weather in the meantime was beautiful with not the slightest sign of an approaching hurricane . As a matter of fact , I had forgotten all about it , and I guess everybody else had too . I spent that night in the Court House , where the resident Commissioner had kindly arranged for me to sleep while I was in Green Turtle Cay . The next morning , Sunday , September 4th , I did not get up till very late . During the afternoon I took a long walk along the sandy shore of the Cay with three boys of the town . One of them was Basil Lowe 's son , a fine strapping young fellow of sixteen . Little did I think that the following day I should be picking up his dead body with the dead body of his baby brother clutched tightly in his arms . The weather on this day , for the first time , gave indication of the approaching trouble . Streaks of thin , filmy cirrus clouds appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread over the entire sky . The wind remained east throughout the day , a gentle breeze at first , later increasing to a moderate breeze . Toward evening , instead of clearing away , the cirrus clouds became thicker until the sky was completely covered by a grayish-white veil . In the east it looked particularly bad . The clouds seemed to be much thicker , rolled and piled up on top of one another with long heavy black streaks . Every once in a while a low cloud would detach itself from the rest of the thick bank and come flying down the wind , bringing a rain squall with it . Just before dark I climbed a high hill back of the town and studied the sky carefully . At this time of year , when such a thick veil of high cirrus clouds shows no signs of disappearing in the evening , it is usually the signal of an approaching hurricane . As I stood up there alone on the hill , the daylight began to fail and the east became one black mass , with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water . From out of this the shades of night seemed to reach quickly across the water and settle over everything . There was nothing left but the booming of the surf on the outer reef and a pale greenish light in the western sky where the sun had gone down . I walked back to the town , feeling sure that the hurricane would come down during the night . Before turning in I looked up my friend Basil Lowe and we talked for an hour or so , principally about the weather . I found that during the afternoon the barometer had gone down , but not alarmingly . The town was by this time in a state of great activity with everybody prepar ! ng for the worst . All doors and w:ndows were being nailed up tight and battened ; any movable object was put under cover or shelter of some kind . Some men put long shores against the sides of their houses with the bottom ends planted firmly in the ground and the tops against the second story . The women packed all clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of a room on the lower floor , usually dunnaged up with boards so as to keep them out of water if the floor were flooded . The goats , sheep , and other livestock were tied up under the houses to the underpinning to keep them from being killed by things flying through the air . There were about fifty dinghy boats owned by different people in the settlement , and it was necessary to drag them all up to the highest part of the cay , as these hurricanes are often accompanied by tidal waves that do nearly as much damage as the wind . The big boats , of which there were six , presented more of a problem . During the day they had all been moved to an adjoining harbor called Block Sound and put up among the mangroves on the shore , made fast with all the lines and chains available . Every man and boy was turned to doing something . While these preparations were going on there was a steady undercurrent of nervousness and excitement , which I believe everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for the night at about 8:00 P.M , This was a big two-story stone building with walls eighteen inches thick . It had a shingled hipped roof . It seemedabout the most substantial building in the entire place , and I certainly never for a moment thought that it would be blown to pieces by the wind . However , I turned in with my clothes on , or as sailors say , all standing , ready to heave out quickly if things got too bad . By this time I was thoroughly convinced that we should get a had hurricane ; but oddly enough , the consensus of opinion in the town was that it would not amount to much . After I fell asleep I did not know a thing until the day was breaking . The fateful day of Monday , Sept. 5 , dawned with the hurricane obviously only a few hours off . At daylight , when I turned out , it was blowing a heavy gale of wind with a steady downpour of rain . The squalls which came racing out of the northeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To say that it just rained and blew in these squalls would give you a wrong impression ; the rain was really a solid wall of water driving horizontally before the wind . It seemed impossible to withstand the onslaught . The roof of the Court House was straining and creaking in a most alarming way , and I could already see daylight through several places where the shingles had been stripped off . It was evident that if the wind once got in under the roof the whole thing would be lifted bodily off , and probably take most of the walls with it . Everything in the building was soaking wet , in fact , the whole place was flooded , as the rain seemed to beat right through the walls and roof and run in torrents from the places where the shingles were missing . I quickly got myself some breakfast , and then went up to the main part of the town to see what the situation there was like . I found the entire male population turned out making lastminute repairs to buildings , boats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent gale and the rain was pouring down in such a deluge that it was really impossible to do anything more outside . With four or five other men I went to a store kept by Mr. Willis Bethel and there sat talking and waiting to see what was going to happen . Mr. Bethel had a barometer , and when looked at it I am sure that my heart missed several beats . I have spent practically my entire life at sea , which means constantly watching barometers in all parts of the world and under all kinds of weather conditions ; but I had certainly never seen anything like this before . It then read 28.8q , which in itself is disconcerting enough in this part of the world , but what was worse , I could actually see it going down all the time . I tried to time it but found that my watch had stopped and was full of water . I suppose that there was not a dry thing in the whole place by this time . When the barometer reached 28.00 I thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The last time I can remember noticing it , it read 27.50 . I had never before even heard of a barometer being this low . The wind had by now reached what I judged to be hurricane force , and seemed to be getting worse every moment . The squalls came sweeping over at shorter intervals and would strike with a terrific blast of wind and driving stream of water like a fire hose . Shingles , fence palings , and almost every other kind of article imaginable were by this time flying through the air . It was beginning to look serious . The other men had all gone to their respective houses where their wives and families were gathered in the strongest part of the house with the doors and windows boarded up and nailed closed . The building which I was in would obviously not hold together for much longer , and Mr. Bethel decided to abandon it altogether and take refuge in his dwelling with his family . I abandoned it too , with the idea of going back to the Court House , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when I got outside I realized just how hard it was blowing . To stand upright w almost impossible , but I managed to get down the main street by crouching over and pulling myself along the sides of buildings , fences , or anything that happened to be within reach . The buildings were still standing all right although there were plenty of boards and pieces of lumber flying about . I did not see any other people outside . Right in the center of the town there is a store kept by a woman named Mrs. Roberts , and I stopped in there on my way by as I noticed the door on the lee side was open . Inside the store at the time I found Mrs. Roberts , her daughter , one old man almost sixty years old , and a little girl of about five or six . They all appeared to be very frightened and were naturally anxious to have news of what was going on and how other people were making out . As it happened , I never got back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people the hurricane came down in all its fury . II The store that we were in now was a low one-story wooden building almost sixty feet long and fifteen feet wide . There were counters on both sides running the whole length . Shelves , built on the walls from the floor right up to the collar beams , were piled with canned foods and all kinds of other merchandise . When I first entered the building it seemed to be withstanding the wind all right and showed no signs of breaking up , although everything was flooded by the rain which was beating in under the shingles of the roof and the weather-boarding on the sides . The water got so deep on the floor that I ripped up a plank in the lowest part to let it run out underneath . The end of the building which faced on the main street was to leeward , and we left the door on this end open so that we could see what was going on outside . I was in the store , I should say , at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hurricane struck . It came with one terrific blast of wind and water , like a judgment of the Lord , sweeping everything before it . The building creaked in every joint and the sides bulged like rubber balloons . The women immediately became hysterical and after a few moments threw themselves upon their knees and prayed . Never before in my life have I felt so utterly helpless and insignificant . There was literally nothing that anybody could do . The Lord knows how hard it was blowing . Any estimate that I make of the velocity of the wind is only the wildest guess . I do know that the weather observatory at Hopetown , twenty-five miles away , registered a velocity of one hundred and sixty miles an hour before the place blew down . This was several hours before the real hurricane struck . If this was correct , it certainly must have been blowing well over two hundred . When the onslaught struck , my first impulse was to run outside , as it was perfectly obvious that the building was not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there looking out , trying all the time to remain cool and keep my senses , which was nearly impossible with the hurricane howling outside and the women hysterically screaming inside . Never have I seen such frightful destruction . The crash of buildings being smashed to pieces could be heard even above the roaring of the wind and rain . Directly across the street there stood a big three-story stone house in which fourteen people were gathered to ride out the storm . As I stood there watching , the first few blasts ripped all the shingles off the roof and sent them off to leeward like a shower of leaves . An instant later the entire building collapsed , some of the heavy stones being carried off with the wind , but most of them crashing down among the wreckage of floors and partitions that remained . I had not seen anybody leave the house and thought that they had all surely been killed . If they had not been killed they were probably trapped in the wreckage , but even so , I was perfectly powerless to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and go out in the storm now seemed like sure death . There were roofs , whole sides of houses , boats , and all kinds of wreckage hurtling through the air and crashing right and left into other buildings . It is really impossible for me to describe the frightful havoc , as anything I say is inadequate . At about this time a man suddenly appeared , apparently from nowhere , crawling up to the house on his hands and knees as best he could , his head streaming with blood . I dragged him in the door and tried to find out where he had come from , but he did not seem to know himself . He said that he had been in two different houses that had gone down , and had been struck on the head by something . He had quite a bad cut just over his ear which I bound up as well as I could with my handkerchief . After this he just sat on the floor moaning and praying . His nerve was completely gone , but I could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been really hurt . He certainly did riot improve the morale of the women , who by this time were screaming and carrying on in the most frightful way . The next people to come in for shelter were a young fellow about my age with his wife and a little baby who had been in the big stone house that I had seen demolished . They had had an awful time . As the building was collapsing the man had thrown his wife , with the baby in her arms , out clear of the wreckage , then jumped after them himself . They seemed to think that the other people had been killed instantly . Since then they had been buffeted about by the storm , desperately fighting to get in under some kind of shelter . How that fellow managed to drag his wife and child over the piles of wreckage , and protect them from the fury of the hurricane will always be a mystery to me . They were cut and bruised and completely exhausted . Their nerves were also completely gone and they immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time the hurricane had been raging unabated ? getting worse if this were possible . I had been watching the building which we were in very closely , and had just about decided that it was time to leave , as it would most certainly not hold together much longer . The sides were bulging out and the roof seemed about to lift off at any minute . The fastenings had started in all the joints and the ends of the rafters had come away from the plates about six inches . I broke up the prayer meeting and suggested that we all go out and fight our way to the nearest house that was standing , and which could be reached by crawling over the ruins of two other houses . As I was talking there came one terrific squall of wind accompanied by a ripping and tearing noise , and then the whole building simply took off from its foundation like an airplane . All hands were sent sprawling on the floor and the things on the shelves came piling down on top of us . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it , was flying through the air , and it seemed to me then as though it would never come to earth . It finally landed with a splintering crash that broke in the floor in several places . This was enough for me . I decided to leave without any further loss of time and try to find shelter in some other house that would have more regard for the laws of gravitation . I sang out to the others that I was going , and tried to persuade Mrs. Roberts and her daughter to come with me . However , by this time they were in such a state of combined hysterics and devotion that they had not even got up off the floor . I started out the door , which was on the lee side of the building , and immediately was picked up off my feet by a puff of wind , blown bodily in the air across the street , and crashed through a picket fence on the other side , which for some reason was still there . I was then blown and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house , until I finally got a firm grip with both hands on an old piece of floor joist . I hung on to this for dear life , trying to collect my thoughts , while the deluge poured down on my back , and the wind roared by with such force that it sometimes took all my strength to keep from being torn away . It was hard for me to see anything in the driving rain ; in fact , it was altogether impossible even to open my eyes if I was facing it . The howling of the hurricane and the general noise and confusion of the destruction going on around me , combined with the constant danger of having my brains knocked out by something flying in mid-air , made it very difficult even to think . From the position I was in I could see only two houses left standing . The rest of the town was simply a tangled mass of wreckage and ruins . As there was certainly no point in remaining where I was , lying flat on my stomach , completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make my way towards the nearest house , which , I should say , was about two hundred yards off . Getting there was an awful job . I did it on my hands and knees , sometimes crawling and sometimes literally dragging myself along against the wind . In the particularly heavy squalls I had to stop all progress and stretch flat on the ground , hanging on to whatever was near with all my strength to keep from being blown away . I had one very close call . The whole gable end of a house suddenly appeared from nowhere , driving through the air and coming right at me . I did not have time to do anything but throw myself flat on my stomach , and when I looked up again it had passed clear over me and was disappearing to leeward , gaining altitude all the time . I finally managed to work my way round to the leeward side of the house that I was heading for , and went in through an open door . Everything inside was crazy . There were five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in a state of hysterics . The house was shaking and vibrating so that you could hardly stand up , and the water was pouring down through the ceiling in a perfect deluge . As soon as I got inside one of the men told me that he was afraid the house would collapse at any moment , and that ' they ' were all about to leave it . Before he had finished talking there was a noise like an explosion , and the roof and part of the second story were torn off . Next the windward wall blew in and the ceiling above started to come down on top of us . All hands piled pell mell through the door , out into the hurricane . As I went I grabbed one of the children , a little girl of about six or seven , who had apparently got separated from her family . The confusion and chaos outside had by this time reached a point impossible to describe . I had no idea what the others intended doing , but I immediately started struggling along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was still standing near by . The rest of the people , orrather those of them that I could sec , struck out in the opposite direction . They looked like ants as they crawled along on the ground , desperately clutching at pieces of wreckage and cowering behind the ruins of buildings . It was a fearful moment , and I will confess that I was having difficulty in thinking clearly myself . The child simply clung to me , with her two arms around my waist , whimpering and crying . I looked back once and saw the remains of the house we had just left being smashed to matchwood by the fury of the wind . The next moment a whole dinghy boat came flying out of space through the air and landed with a terrific crash a few feet from us . My face was cut and bleeding badly in several places from the sand and gravel driven horizontally before the wind , and I was having great difficulty in protecting the child from it . The rain alone was really as much as a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flight of stone steps built up from the ground and leading apparently to nowhere , but just rising up into space . There was a section of a roof wedged in behind them , and several other pieces of wreckage lying strewn about which gave evidence that a house had once stood there . I got round to leeward of the steps and crouched behind them to rest for a few moments before continuing on my way . The first thing I noticed was a pair of legs protruding from under the roof . I pulled on them and dragged out the body of a rather old man , cold and quite dead . III After I had finally reached the house for which I was aiming I had quite a job to get in , as all the windows and doors were boarded up and nailed shut . The door on the lee side was fastened from within , and it was only after I had started to batter it down with a piece of rafter that the people realized there was somebody trying to get in . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been used as a store . It had been unoccupied for some time , but when the hurricane struck , several families took refuge there , as it was a most substantial building . When I arrived there were about fifty people all told inside , men , women , and children . Never before have I seen a more frightened , helpless , and thoroughly miserable gathering of human beings . It was really pathetic . The windows being all boarded up , it was as black as night inside . The water was pouring down in streams from the floor above , and everybody was soaked to the hide . The women and children lay huddled together on the floor , their teeth chattering with the cold , praying hysterically to the Lord for mercy . The roaring and howling of the hurricane outside made it almost impossible to think , and to talk it was necessary to shout at the top of your lungs . These poor wretches had been cooped up in this black hell-hole since the storm first broke and had no idea what was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news of their families and relations , but I did not have the heart to tell them how bad things really were . Surely they were suffering enough without my adding to it by a tale of death . With a heavy heart I thought of the next day and of the train of woes and misery that it would bring : of these poor , simple , God-fearing people standing alone beneath the soft blue sky and warm sunshine , among the ruins of what had once been their homes , and of their children being laid to rest forever in the soil . Although the storm was now at its very height , the house showed no signs of giving way . But as it was a stone house , I was afraid that if anything struck it it would come down veryquickly and , therefore , started at once to plan a course of action in case we should have to leave it . I stood at the door on the lee side and from there could see only one house standing ? and that had half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonged to Dr. Kendricks , the local doctor , and was obviously the place to go next if we had to move . If the house we were in collapsed on top of all these people it would be a frightful thing . I was determined not to get caught under it , and kept the little girl close to me all the time , ready to run out at a moment 's notice . I had lost all track of time but I suddenly realized that it was beginning to get dark . This made matters worse than ever , as it would most certainly be impossible to move around outside in the night without being killed . The darkness came quickly and with it , to my great relief , came a decided change for the better in the weather . The wind in the space of a few moments went right down to nothing but a strong breeze , and the rain stopped altogether . The general opinion of the rest of the men seemed to be that this was the end of the hurricane , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just a temporary calm while the center passed over us . If you are in the path of the center of a cyclone storm of this type , it will be calm for a short while as it passes over , then the wind will come with hurricane force again from the opposite direction . As soon as it moderated , all hands went to work at something . The most important need was something to eat for the women and children , as the majority of them had had nothing the entire day . Three men went to the remains of Mrs. Roberts ' store to search around for some food and for some lanterns and oil . Two other men went to work on the building , battening up windows on the top floor which had HURRICANE IN blown open , reenforcing doors , and a hundred other much needed repairs . I tried to get them to nail up the doors and windows on the south side , which so far had been to leeward , in case the wind came from that direction , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it myself but we had only one piece of iron for a hammer , practically no nails , and only what lumber we could rip off partitions inside . Their failure to do it nearly cost the lives of everybody in the building an hour or so later . In the meantime , I went to Dr. Kendricks ' house to see how many were there , and also to try to find out what the barometer was doing . I found Dr. Kendricks ' home in much the same condition as the one I had just left . There were about one hundred people crowded into it , many of them quite badly hurt . The women and children lay huddled together in the darkness crying and praying . I tried to raise their spirits and comfort them but there was practically nothing that I could do . I think that I shall always remember this feeling of helplessness as the worst part of the hurricane . Never before in my life have I been so totally unable to cope with a situation . Nobody had any idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness and confusion of the night it was certainly impossible to find out . Dr. Kendricks appeared to be the only man who was really keeping his head . He went about his work of giving first aid to the injured in a calm , businesslike manner , although he had himself suffered as much loss of property as anybody . I found Mrs. Roberts here , unconscious , with a fractured skull . Dr. Kendricks had brought her in himself . Kendricks ' barometer stood at 17.60 and showed no signs of rising . This convinced me that the hurricane was really only half over , and that the calm which now prevailed ( mid soon be broken by the wind coming howling from out of the south . IV I had no sooner got back inside the stone house than the wind came again , this time from the southward , in violent squalls , accompanied by the usual downpour of driving rain . There were several more people in the building now , who had taken advantage of the lull to crawl from under the ruins of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths amounted to seven , with about two hundred still entirely unaccounted for . All the colored people lived at one end of the town , and nobody had seen or heard a thing from them . There was not a sign of a house left standing in this section . I now began to feel a pain in my right side which was caused , I found out a week later , by one of my ribs being broken . This had probably happened when I was blown through the picket fence but I had not noticed it till now . The hurricane was now raging outside with the same violence and destruction but from the opposite direction . Right away we found ourselves in a very bad position , because the windows and doors on the south side of the building had not been boarded up . On account of the shift of the wind this was now the windward side . The very first squalls had smashed the sash right out of the window frames and torn the doors off their hinges . The water was pouring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and small pieces of wreckage . All hands had to move to the leeward side , which meant almost sure death if the building collapsed . It would not have been possible to get out as all these doors and windows were fastened on the outside . I was afraid that the wind , by getting inside the building , would lift the roof off or blow the walls right out . Already the wooden partitions inside were beginning to buckle badly . Something had to be done and done quickly . I went outside with two men to help me , and after an awful battle , lasting nearly an hour , we managed to get the openings boarded up to a great extent . It was a most surprising thing to me how a lot of these men appeared to lose their nerve . Many of them just simply gave up and joined the women in prayer , rather than make any effort to help themselves . The moaning of the injured , together with the weeping and screaming of the women , made a most frightful din @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man started singing hymns at the top of his lungs and was immediately joined by everybody else . This would have been very nice except that he chose for his opening number " We Will Meet in the Sweet By and By . " It was the last straw for me , and I could not help suggesting that he sing something a little more cheerful . Things went on like this for what seemed like hour after hour . Nobody had a watch , but I should say that it was about midnight when I noticed that the wind had started to moderate slightly . The rain continued just as hard but the squalls were considerably lighter than they had been . Somebody came up from Dr. Kendricks ' house with the welcome news that the barometer had started rising rapidly . This was very reassuring and convinced me that the worst of the hurricane was now over . For the remainder of the night the weather continued to improve steadily until by daylight the wind had moderated to a strong gale , and the rain , though still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As soon as the danger was obviously past the people all began to brighten up . Somebody during the lull had managed to get a kerosene stove out of Mrs. Roberts ' store , so I turned to and made strong tea for all hands . We had also a couple of boxes of soda biscuits . After this the women and children lay down on the floor and through sheer exhaustion were soon fast asleep I had dried out my pipe and tobacco over the stove . After drinking six cups of boiled black tea , munching a couple of handfuls of biscuits , and smoking three pipes of strong tobacco , I was once again ready for anything . There was nothing to do now but wait for the daylight . Many times before in my life have I spent long hours on end searching the eastern sky for the first streaks of dawn ; but all these hours of waiting put together were as nothing compared to the short time between the moderating of the hurricane and daylight the next morning . I really thought that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the question with the moaning and suffering that was going on on all sides . People kept coming in with reports from different parts of the town , and the list of dead and injured was mounting steadily . The most serious thing for the immediate present was the condition of the people who were still living but trapped under the ruins of their houses unable to get out . This was the first job to be tackled . Every man who was physically able turned to , but , nevertheless , it was a slow , hard job to get these poor wretches out , as the gale of wind and pouring rain made it very difficult to work . V With the first signs of daylight 1 started for Basil Lowe 's house to see how he and his family had come through . Nothing appeared to be left standing , and the streets were piled so high with wreckage that it was impossible to follow them . Where Basil Lowe 's house had stood the day before was a litter of smashed timbers . In the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eldest son , a fine boy of sixteen , lying face downward on the ground , cold and stone dead . I roiled it over and found that his neck had been broken . With a death grip , he still held in his arms the body of his baby brother , also cold and dead . I carried them both out to an open space and laid them on the ground side by side , then covered them with loose boards , weighted down with stones , so that they would not blow away . As I was doing this Basil himself appeared . It was the most harrowing moment of my life and there was little that I could say to him at the time . He had had a frightful experience during the hurricane and was in a dazed condition . When his house collapsed he , his wife , six children , and his mother-in-law all had to run for their lives . His wife had fallen through the floor and was perfectly unconscious , which meant that he had to carry her in his arms after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed , by the gable end of the building , as they ran through the door . In some way or other he had managed to get the rest of them into a near-by house , but had only been there a short while before this also collapsed . Once again they found themselves out in the hurricane , and once again he carried and dragged them all to safety under the floor of a ruined house , where they remained until daylight . He had not yet told his wife about the two children being killed . I returned to the stone house , in which there were now about one hundred additional people who had come in from different parts of the town , all in the same state of exhaustion and hysterics . It was now so full that it was almost impossible to get in through the door . By this time everybody in the settlement had been accounted for , and the death toll amounted to eighteen , with twenty-five badly injured . We held a kind of council of war to talk over our position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead had to be buried , but this was practically impossible until the weather moderated . It was still blowing too hard to walk round without holding on to something , and the rain was pouring down in a steady torrent . Luckily there had been quite a quantity of food salvaged from the ruins of the various stores . Some people had managed ? how , the Lord only knows ? to unearth some clothing , blankets , and quilts that were still fairly dry , and these were immediately distributed amongst the women and children . The women got busy brewing gallons of strong tea and baking johnny cakes . Somebody collected several dead fowls from among the ruins , and we soon had steaming hot soup , which , I thought at the time , was the best thing I had ever tasted . Very discouraging reports came back of how the colored people had fared in the storm . Their houses were all built in one district at the eastern end of the town , and had all been destroyed with the very first blasts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not knowing where to turn , had very sensibly taken to the open country . At the very height of the storm , men , women , and children , about eighty of them altogether , had desperately crawled , dragged , and fought their way up the side of a high hill , and had taken refuge in a stone quarry at the top . The quarry was a huge round pit about three hundred feet in diameter and sixty feet deep , which afforded shelter from the wind but not from the cold and wet . They had all huddled together at the bottom on the windward side , while the hurricane went thundering by overhead . It was now getting on toward the middle of the day . I decided to go up into the quarry and spend the night in the open rather than stick it out in the stone house amid such misery and suffering . Anyway all the space available was needed for the injured and the women and children . The poor colored people in the quarry , nearly blue with the cold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weather and with nothing to eat , for over twenty-four hours . I do not yet know how they stood it . I had brought a few tins of beef along with me , which I quickly divided up among the women , and then dispatched somebody back to the town for more . They were all so terrified and exhausted that I had difficulty in persuading anybody to venture up out of the pit . I must say that I can hardly blame them for this . I noticed a dead horse lying at the bottom of the quarry and was wondering how in the world it had got there . They told me that they had no idea where it had come from , but at the height of the storm it had suddenly appeared flying through the air , and had dropped about sixty feet to whereit now lay . One old negro preacher said that he had thought it was the dove coming down upon the Apostles , but I could not exactly see the simile . He apparently considered it as some kind of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to the edification of his audience , about the Ark full of animals landing on " Mount Arral " after forty days of flood . He managed to work into it something about the waters of the Red Sea being opened , then rambled on about Saint Simon fishing in the Lake of Galilee ; in fact he used every part of Scripture that had anything to do with water . I thought it most appropriate as both he and his congregation looked more than half drowned . I spent the afternoon in the quarry , trying to keep out of the rain by crouching under a shelf of rock , getting colder , wetter , and more miserable every minute . Toward evening the wind seemed to moderate considerably , and I returned to the town in search of a more comfortable place . There was not much comfort to be found . But at least the hurricane was over .
