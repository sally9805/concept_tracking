California has the highest mountains , deepest valleys , best climate , loveliest women , mightiest men , craziest cults and most enthusiastic boosters of any State in the Union . It is therefore fitting that this superlative State should have the world 's most extraordinary bridge , opened last week in true Californian style with a bang-up jamboree . <P> First proposed in 1856 , the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge was not begun until May 1933 . To celebrate its opening , California scheduled a three-day fiesta which officially began with speeches at the bridgehead at the Oakland end . Rabbi A. A. Stern offered prayers for the 24 men who lost their lives during construction . Herbert Hoover told how the commission he appointed in 1929 first decided that the bridge was possible . Charles Henderson , an officer of Reconstruction Finance Corp. , which financed the bridge with loans of $77,600,000 , represented President Roosevelt . Chief Engineer Charles Henry Purcell paid tribute to his staff . A steel-helmeted worker paid tribute to the daily average of 6,500 men employed in the construction . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frank Finley Merriam severed a gold link in a silver chain across the bridge entrance . Said he profoundly : " This bridge is not the product of a day ! " <P> As the chain fell , 1,500 pigeons sprang into the air . In the harbor , 14 men-of-war boomed a 21-gun salute . Some seals popped up near one of the piers , added their barks to the crowd 's cheers . Across the sky droned 250 Navy planes . Beneath them popped a display of daytime fireworks . The dignitaries drove across the bridge to San Francisco , repeated their speeches there . Not until they were carefully out of the way was the public admitted . Then , in the White House , President Roosevelt pressed his little gold key . On flashed green lights at each end of the bridge and a phalanx of cars charged up the ramps . In the first twelve hours , 70,000 cars drove across . Toll : 65 . That night the Navy contributed to California 's debutante party a searchlight cotillion . <P> Crossing from the San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill , then over the world 's two largest suspension bridges , stretching end-to-end for two miles to Yerba Buena ( " Goat " ) Island . There , the highway dives for 500 ft. through the world 's largest bore tunnel , 76 ft. wide , 58 ft. high . Next come the world 's third largest cantilever bridge ( 1,400 ft. ) , five smaller spans , then a long trestle to the Oakland shore . Total length is eight and one quarter miles . The whole structure is strong enough to resist the mightiest earthquake ever known . If the biggest of battleships hit one of the main piers at full speed , the bridge would only quiver , the ship would be telescoped . The world 's greatest and most costly over-water roadway has two decks , no pedestrian walks . The bottom deck for trucks and trains will not be completed until 1938 . Top deck has six lanes , will permit 10,000,000 cars to cross annually . Experts predict that tolls will amortize the bridge 's cost in 20 years . Drivers may hit 45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a tabloid jail in one of the towers . Before nightfall on the first day it had been well used .
