Boy Scout into Field Marshal <P> ( See front cover ) <P> Last spring 18-year-old Egyptian King Farouk went incognito to England 's great festival of precedent and tradition , the Coronation season . Last fortnight Farouk the First arrived back in Cairo to have his own kingship solemnized by a ceremony for which there was no precedent , no tradition . Nearly 2,000 years ago died beak-nosed but fascinating Queen Cleopatra* , the last of the Ptolemaic Dynasty . Egypt then became a province of the Roman Empire until 641 A.D. when it fell to the Mohammedan Empire . In 1914 the British Empire 's War Office issued this proclamation : " In view of the state of war arising out of the action of Turkey in joining Germany and Austria against Britain , France , Belgium and Russia Egypt is placed under the protection of His Majesty King George V and will henceforth constitute a British Protectorate . The suzerainty of Turkey over Egypt is thus terminated . " After the War the British puppetized on the throne of Egypt as " Sultan " the father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who in his declining years was styled " King " ( TIME , May 11 , 1936 et ante ) . Last week , however , big-boned , fair and six-foot-tall Farouk I was correctly hailed by Egyptian dignitaries representing his 16,000,000 subjects as " The first Sovereign invested as King of modern Egypt , the Senior Arab Kingdom . " + <P> Since no precedents existed to guide His Majesty 's Government , plans for last week 's ceremony were evolved in last-minute haste by tubby little Premier Mustafa El Nahas Pasha . To make up his mind on one point he telephoned from Cairo , Egypt to Vichy , France where an eminent expert on protocol was taking a water cure . The question was whether to crown His Majesty with the golden fillet once worn by Ancient Egypt 's King Tutankhamen and only unearthed in recent years . This was a good idea , except that Mohammedan sovereigns are never crowned , and Premier Nahas knew that the Egyptian people grew accustomed , when they were subjects of Turkey , to seeing each new Sultan symbolically invested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeweled sword of Mohammed Ali , founder of the present Egyptian dynasty , or so the Premier thought . Upon actually looking for this historic State Sword , it simply could not be found . With neither sword nor crown exactly available , His Majesty 's Government ordered that anyhow the State procession should be featured by bright red limousines , changed this finally to one bright red limousine for Premier Nahas and a shiny gold coach for King Farouk .
