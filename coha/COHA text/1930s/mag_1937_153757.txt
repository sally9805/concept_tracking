The standard African game-hunting expedition consists of several big , fearless men looking for lions and buffalo , and a battalion of black " boys " who wear their shirttails hanging outside and call their employers bwana . Ivan Sanderson , a young zoologist , broke all the rules when he went game hunting in Africa in 1932 . At Cambridge he had decided it was necessary for anthropologists to know more about the neglected , obscure little animals whose places in evolution were uncertain and whose capture would have scientific rather than sporting importance . To help him collect them , he again broke the rules by selecting men who were not the usual great athletes and huntsmen , but barflies whose long hours in smoky night clubs , reasoned Zoologist Sanderson , had endowed them with the endurance required for life on the Dark Continent . <P> With two men of this mettle , Mr. Sanderson relates in a highly readable book published this week , * he set off for a section of West Africa called Mamfe . He chose it because while it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beasts he wanted . Hundreds of specimens collected by the Sanderson expedition had never been bagged before . One of the first animals he encountered was a horrible , smelly little creature named the shrew . It looks like a rat with a long snout and eats anything from snakes to other shrews . Other of Zoologist Sanderson 's beasts were no less odd . He captured several varieties of frogs that changed color and one that grew hair . He got into a fight with a herd of drills , which are a kind of baboon , and they threw rocks at each other until he scared them off with a series of Rugby calls . <P> What makes Ivan Sanderson 's account of his amiable expedition heart-warming is the fact that his sympathy toward animals is as rich as his eye for observed detail is acute and his prose style is limpid . Sample : ' ' Above me rose the immensity of the primeval forest , filtering the golden sunlight , as it has done since the dawn of terrestrial life . In the bowels of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furry squirrels , countless birds , and scaly lizards . <P> " So much I saw lying there . Deomys , a lanky rat with hind legs like springs , came bounding past in pairs , their sleek orange fur glistening in the half-light , their white bellies immaculate as snow . Bundles of purplish fur bobbed up and down amongst the water weeds , every now and then appearing on open patches of mud and sand , balanced on their pale , stilt-like supports and long , naked tails . A marsh rat ( Malacomys ) has much to do as darkness falls , searching out likely feeding grounds , cleaning his dense woolly coat , preening his immense whiskers , and apparently fraternizing with his kind . <P> " Never , until I watched this kaleidoscope of little life , did I realize how much rats cooperate and gossip .
