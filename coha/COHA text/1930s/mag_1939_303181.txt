THE LETTERS OF RALPH WALDO EMERSON-Columbia University Press-6 vols. ( $30 ) . <P> The best letters are brief , direct , factual . The best letter writers are usually women and soldiers , who observe closely , state simply . Worst letter writers are usually writers-who philosophize . Among topflight U. S. letter-writing writers have long been Henry Adams , Henry James , John Hay , Nathaniel Hawthorne and Ralph Waldo Emerson . Last week readers who could spare the price could look at all the Emerson letters they were ever likely to want , in six good-looking , gilt and salmon-pink volumes . Of these letters , claims Editor Ralph Leslie Rusk , 2,313 have never been printed before . <P> Emerson 's best letters were written to his family on his lecture tours . They considerably spoil the conventional picture of New England 's **26;11985;TOOLONG as shy , frail and retiring . Because Emerson was surrounded by people like volcanic bluestocking Margaret Fuller , semi-insane Greek Scholar Jones Very , zany Poet Ellery Channing and " this Gautama " Bronson Alcott , myth has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly was . <P> On lecture tours in Maine ( the arctic villages made him imagine he was exiled to Siberia ) , out in the frontier West , Emerson all but forgot the Concord saints . The men in the Maine train he found " independent , with sufficient manners and more manly force than most of the scholars he had known .

If his travels read like a drummer 's timetable , his Abolition activities make lim look like a Balkan conspirator . Such behavior as his dining John Brown , " a real hero , " might shock Concord , but Emerson snapped his fingers . It need not have surprised any who recalled that the American Revolution was barely a generaion old when the penniless Emerson boy used to " thrill " as he pastured the family cow " on the battlefield , " and that the author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to veterans of the fight at Concord Bridge . <P> The first of these Emerson letters is dated 1814 , while Madison was still President and the War of 1812 was drawing to its close . The last was written in 1881 , when Emerson 's mind was beginning to dim . He could no longer spell the simplest words , recall the simplest names . " He was a good man , " he said standing at Longfellow 's bier , " I can not remember his name . " To Sam Bradford , " oldest of friends , " he says in a last letter , " I have ceased to write , because the pen refuses to spell . "
