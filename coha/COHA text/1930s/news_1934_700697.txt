txt The New Securities and Exchange Commission , which is to administer the law regulating stock exchanges and the sale of securities , met for the first time today and used up most of the time Wrangling over the chairmanship . In the end the skies cleared and at 5 o'clock the members of the commission took the oath of office and unanimously elected Joseph P. Kennedy , of New York , chairman for one year . The program called for the swearing in of the commissioners at 3 P. M. , but the chairmanship snag was encountered and for two hours it looked as if the day would end without the commission assuming office and without electing a chairman . The commissioners divided into two groups , one group occupying the office of Commissioner James M. Landis , and the other that of Commissioner George M. Mathews , in the Federal Trade Commission Building . Messrs . Landis and Mathews are leaving the Trade Commission to serve on the new Securities and Exchange Commission . Pecora Opposed Kennedy . Ferdinand Pecora of New York , the one-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office shortly before 3 o'clock . It was said that he had not up to that time decided to accept his appointment as a member of the commission , the reason being , according to talk in trade commission corridors , that he was opposed to the election of Mr. Kennedy to the chairmanship . Last February Mr. Pecora , as counsel for the Senate Banking and Currency Committee , developed the fact that Mr. Kennedy had participated with members of Kuhn , Loeb &; Co. , Walter P. Chrysler , Lehman Bros. , and other persons and firms in a Stock Exchange syndicate that operated in 145,000 shares of the common stock of the Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Company . That was understood to be the reason back of Mr. Pecora 's opposition to the election of Mr. Kennedy . During the first hour of the discussion , 1. ( r . Pecora was secluded in the office of Mr. Landis while Mr. Kennedy , Mr. Mathews and Judge Healy of the commission were in close conference in the office of Mr. Mathews , four rooms further west in the same corridor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion to and from the Mathews office . He looked very solemn as he passed back and forth , and refused to answer any questions . After more than an hour had elapsed Mr. Kennedy emerged from the Mathews office and was escorted by Mr. Landis into the office containing Mr. Pecora . Another hour passed and the big building was deserted by all but members of the commission , newspaper men and photographers , when without warning Messrs . Kennedy , Landis and Pecora emerged from seclusion and proceeded to the office of Commissioner Mathews . They were smiling . Mr. Pecora and Mr. Kennedy , marching side by side and in perfect step , were as chipper as two long-parted and suddenly reunited brothers . All was well , they told the newspaper men , as they formed in single file for the entrance into the office of Mr. Mathews . A score of photographers crowded into the room . Then it was discovered that Judge Healy was missing . He had gone to his own office on the floor above . In answer to a telephone call Commissioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when informed that the hour to take the oath had finally arrived . The oath was administered by Mrs. Edna B. Vincel , a notary of the Federal Trade Commission . That formality over , the photographers had their inning . There followed a brief executive session at which Mr Kennedy was elected chairman . When it was over Commissioner Landis came to the door and motioned to the newspaper men to enter . Plied With Questions . The commission was seated behind a big table with Mr. Kennedy in the centre , Mr. Pecora on his right , and Mr. Landis his left . " What was the occasion for this long delay , why in the past hour were the three Democratic members of the commission , yourself , Mr. Pecora and Mr Landis , closet . ed in one room while the Republican members , Messrs . Healy and Mathews. remained in this room ? " Mr. Kennedy was asked . " We were simply discussing policies and matters like that , " replied Mr. Kennedy . " We discussed a dozen different things , " Mr. Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The answer was a unanimous smile , all memb  --  rs of the commission participating . " Did it take longer to settle the chairmanship than it did the other 1 eleven matters discussed ? " Mr. Kennedy was then asked . " You are entirely wrong , " was the reply . Mr. Pecora was asked if he had taken advantage of the opportunity to question Mr. Kennedy as to his participation in the Libbey-OwensFord glass syndicate . Mr. Pecora replied that he had not . The matter of the chairmanship he would not discuss . " I want to render all the service I can and I shall try to do so . " Mr. Pecora said . " I will try and do my I part to put the child on its feet . " The commission will meet tomor-1 row , at which time it will take its next step in the matter of organizaition . A complete staff , which will probably number about 200 persons , has to be recruited .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
