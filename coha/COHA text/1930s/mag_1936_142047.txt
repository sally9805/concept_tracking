Dignity , like the Imperial mantle which is placed upon England 's King at his Coronation , clothed Edward VIII and his every act last week after the decision of His Majesty to abdicate and become not " Mr. Windsor " but Prince Edward , newly created Duke of Windsor , and still Knight of the Most Ancient &; Most Noble Order of the Thistle , Knight of the Most Illustrious Order of St. Patrick , Knight Grand Commander of the Most Exalted Star of India , Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order , Grand Master of the Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael &; St. George , Grand Master of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire , Knight of the Golden Fleece of Spain , Knight of the Order of the Annunziata of Italy . <P> Scarcely anyone failed to tune in on Edward VIII as he took leave of his country or to read within a few hours the simple words with which His Royal Highness said good-by to very nearly all except " the woman I love . " <P> Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do and say all he could to uphold the Kingdom and the Empire , giving no opportunity to irresponsible groups of the masses to harm Britain . Long after His Majesty 's instrument of abdication was signed , sealed , published and in course of certain enactment by Parliament ( see p. 17 ) one of the greatest mass gatherings in British history was still roaring outside of Buckingham Palace , " WE WANT EDWARD ! " He was not there . <P> Neither as King Edward , nor later last week as Prince Edward , did the eldest son of the Royal House enter London . This idol of the British masses ( for such His Majesty unquestionably was ) vanished , and after a little space other idols ( for such King George VI , Queen Elizabeth and crown princess Elizabeth will soon be ) were substituted .

Its symbol is the Crown , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanley Baldwin and a few hundred others . They rule over millions of British soft hats , tens of millions of caps and hundreds of millions of Indian noddles . Members of the British Royal Family have long had this basic reality embedded in their natures , and last week in King Edward VIII 's hour of sorest indecision it tipped the scales . He left England as the eldest son who has locked a rattling skeleton in the Empire 's closet and thrown away the key . Not ungrateful to opportune Winston Churchill , who had offered and sought to form a party of " King 's men " to fight the issue out in Parliament , His Majesty rewarded this active British son of a U. S. mother last week with a discreetly private lunch . <P> With Prince Edward supplying all necessary dignity , the British Broadcasting Corp . found it possible to send out a " children 's hour " message to the moppets of the Empire , a description in words of one and two syllables of the relations between Edward VIII and Mrs. Simpson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scandalous " ( because undignified ) that they were supposed to be something which only a few nasty-minded British adults would stoop to read in the " American press .
