For months Chicago 's LaSalle Street has buzzed with rumors that stormy , exuberant General Robert Elkington Wood was about to resign as president of Sears , Roebuck &; Co. and campaign for public office , possibly the Presidency of the U. S. Sears has a rule that executives must retire at 60 ; the rambunctious General is 59 and no man to twiddle his thumbs . <P> Last week , not General Wood , but wan , diffident Board Chairman Lessing Julius Rosenwald resigned . At 47 he retired to his philanthropies and etchings . Sears ' directors promptly upped General Wood to the chairmanship , a post to which the retirement rule does not apply . <P> Having marched Sears stores into 45 States and raised annual net sales from $319,000,000 to $537,000,000 in eleven years , General Wood is not likely to confine his generalship to board meetings . To succeed him the directors picked a man who can get along with the General ( who chews up cigarets when he is mad ) . New President Thomas Joseph Carney is a company man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Born in 1886 , same year as the company , he went to work at 16 as a shipping clerk . Later he managed the Philadelphia store , rose to be vice president in charge of operations under the excitable General ( who eats caramels in their wrappers ) . <P> Though Sears will be without a Rosenwald at its head for the first time in 39 years , it will have one on its board . Julius Rosenwald 2nd will be one of three new directors to attend the General 's first meeting , which he may begin ( as he does his meals and conferences ) by barking out : " Let 's charge ! "
