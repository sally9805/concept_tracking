txt Imports nave lately come nom Washington , mostly vague , that the Government was considering how , in the Imaginable event of war , such results might be avoided as the closing of the Stock Exchange for five months after war broke out in 1914 . What plans were discussed we are not informed . But it is worth while to consider just what happened to the markets of 1914 , and how far the circumstances would be repeated in the supposable case of outbreak of European war today . The first point of rather striking contrast lies in the well-known fact that Germany 's war declaration in July , 1914 , took the whole world by surprise . The consequence was , that markets of the world were as closely interlocked , the " foreign commitments " of banks , private banking houses and stock exchanges as heavy , as in a period of unbroken peace . On the stock markets , this meant that Continental Europe 's holdings of British or American stocks cou:d be " unloaded " instantly on London  --  perhaps by Berlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided not to close , even when the London Exchange , for the first time in its history , had closed its doors . But overnight , our Stock Exchange authorities learned of an immense mass of selling orders that-had been cabled overnight from Europe , and the governors of the New York Stock Exchange concluded that their only recourse was to close . Their reason was , that financial New York was in no shape to confront such torrent of liquidation , when every other Stock Exchange in the world had stopped business . At New York , the banks had for weeks been close to a deficit in reserves . We had already exported some $120,000,000 gold since 1914 began , and every European belligerent was now grasping at foreign gold supplies . If European sales on our Stock Exchange had been what was threatened , the decline of prices would have so far impaired the value of collateral against call loans as possibly to cause- widespread failures . How far this situation is from applying to the markets of 1939 will readily be seen . So far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to occur , the world 's markets have been preparing during two or three years for such a possibility . International finance is not spread out as it was in 1914 . Whereas American bank reserves were inadequate , even before that year 's war crisis , last week 's report on excess reserves , held ' by private banks in the Federal Reserve membership , showed the wholly unprecedented , surplus of $4,000,000,000 . Instead of Europe 's grasping at our gold , we have imported since last Summer a monthly average of more than $300,000,000 gold , and the gold was sent here , not on ordinary operations , but for safe-keeping against the risk of war . Whether , in case of actual international conflict , there would be outpour of European holdings on our stock exchanges , is perhaps debatable . But it is not certain , financial predictions and precautions having already been what they are , that even Europe 's financial markets would stop trading . What Europe 's attitude would be toward the American market is perhaps conjectural ; but experience in the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we know at least that , whatever might be the history of munitions exports in another conflict , we should have possession of the export trade with neutral countries . But the discussion may be academic ; the not at all ill-grounded hope of every market is that war will be averted .
