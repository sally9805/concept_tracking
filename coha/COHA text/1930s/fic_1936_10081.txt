you come to Toledo we 'll be taking you riding in an automobile . I 'm thinking of getting me one and hitting these old streets up for twenty miles an hour just like that , " Mort said , snapping his fingers in gesticulation . " I 'd rather ride on a grocery wagon than an automobile , " Mary , the flaxen-haired seven-year-old girl , said . " Mother , she 's a tomboy , " the boy said . " Children ! " the mother said in gentle cautioning . " I 'll bet Mary here is a real girl , " Al said . " She 's too real when she gets to climbing fences all along the block , " the mother said . " Just like my nieces and nephews , " said Al . " That 's right , Al , you 're raising and educating one of your nephews , are n't you ? " " I got him in school now . He started this fall , " said Al . " Mary did , too , did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Uh huh ! " " That a part of the alphabet you learned today , Mary ? " Mort asked .

" In another year or so he 'll be too tough for his old man , " Mort said , receiving a reproving look from his wife . " Aw , I can skin you now , " the kid laughed , and Al , rememberingLord Chesterfield 's letter on decency , that is , on bienscance , thought that Mort should read those letters . " Say , Al , how is your brother Ned doing these days ? " " Pretty well , thank you , Mort , " Al said , again nibbling at his steak . " When he comes to Toledo we 'll have to have him out here . Alice , Al 's brother is another jolly O'Flaherty . And he 's a good shoe man , too . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , Al , have some more , " she said . " No , thanks . I 've had plenty , " Al said , thinking that itP101was better manners not to take a second helping , but he was hungry , and it was a delicious supper . " Give me his plate , Alice . When he comes to the Goodwins , he 's got to eat , " Mort said , and as she handed him the plate Mort filled it with a generous second portion . " Say , Al , I wanted to ask you how are the medium vamps going ? " " Not so well , " said Al . " I thought so . They are n't moving much in my store . The short vamps are doing much better , " Mort said , his face full of steak . " The round full toes are going better , too , " said Al . " Oh , you men ! Ca n't you let business alone and see eachother in the store tomorrow ? " Mrs. Goodwin said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , pleasedwith his well-turned and gracious phrase . " Alice , the Duke of O'Flaherty knows the right gab for the ladies , " Mort said , laughing . " I do n't think that that is the proper decorum and eloquencefor a discussion of the knightly practices of chivalry , do you , Duchess ? " Al said . " Say , what is that word you always use , decorum ? " Mort asked . " Latin . It means proper and fitting , everything in its proper place , " Al said with pride . " Say , Al , did you go to college ? You know such a lot , " said Mort . " Al , you do . You talk like an educated man , " she said . " No , I never went to college . " " Neither did I. But say , you must be a whiz to educate yourself and learn all them words you know without getting it in college , " Mort said . Mrs. Goodwin went to the kitchen for tea and dessert , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She went out , and as she came back with a freshly baked cake , she said : " I 'm afraid the cake 's sunk a little . "  | " These kids of mine do n't at all like their mother 's cakes , " Mort said . " Aw , go on , Dad , " the boy said . " I do so , Daddy , " the girl said , with the adults laughing ; the girl eyed them curiously for a moment , but then she laughed , too . " It 'll melt in your mouth , " Mort said . " Countess , it is a cake fit for royalty , " Al said . " Al , when I got me a little woman , I told myself I was going to get me one that can cook , and I was n't fooling myselfnone , either . " " Al , I do n't think the cake deserves such praise . It sunk in the oven , " Mrs. Goodwin said . " Do n't kid yourself , Alice . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mort boasted . " That cake is art , " Al graciously said . " Wait till you taste it first , " she said , handing Al a piece on a small plate . " A most fetching delicacy from the royal oven , " Al said after his first bite . " Melts in your mouth , " Mort mumbled , his words choked off because he had put so much cake in his mouth . " Such joshers ! Goodness gracious ! " " I like it , Mumsy , " the girl said . " You got a sweet tooth , " Mort said with imitation gruffness . " I do so like it , Daddy . " " Arthur there , he does n't . He 's just going to eat a second piece so he does n't hurt his mother 's feelings , " Mort said . " I 'll clear the dishes and get the children set for study in their room . You men go and talk in the parlor , " Mrs. Goodwinsaid when the meal was finished . " You ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Al said . " I would n't think of it . Al , you 're our guest . And if I let that hulk there do it , he 'd break every dish and cause a leak in the faucet , " she said.  | " Is that so ? " Mort joshed , arising , and he and Al went to the parlor . " Say , Mort , what 's Joe Goddard doing now ? " Al asked as both of them were comfortable in the parlor with their cigars . " Nothing , " Mort said . " He 's not a bad scout , " Al said . " You know , Al , he 's too happy-go-lucky . Business is business , and when a man 's got a responsible job , he has got to take his responsibilities seriously . He did n't . He was always drinking , running around after women like one of these Bohemian artists you read about in the papers , the ones that live in Paris . Well , you ca n't be the buyer in a first-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirts . " " Too bad . If he watched his business like the real wise guy does , he could have been a good shoe man . " " Did n't have the will power . You know will power is n't all that you got to have in the game of life , but if you ai n't got it , well , you are as bad off as a guy trying to hit Walter Johnson 's smoke-ball pitches in the dark . He got let out , and I do n't blame ' em for letting him go , either . He had a good job , too . And his wife , as dandy a girl as you 'll ever find . Joe treated her like a dog . I feel sorry , not for his sake , but for hers . He had every chance a man can expect to get in the world , and well , when Old Man Opportunity knocked on his door , he was out in the alley horsing around . I feel sorry for that lovely little woman . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensified self-righteousness . " That 's bad . Bad ! That stuff does n't mix with business , " Al said , thinking proudly that he had never let opportunity find him out of the house when it knocked ; and he never would . And he would never mistreat a lovely woman , either.  | " You got to play the game according to the rules to get anywhere , Mort . " " No exaggeration in that pearl of wisdom , Al , " Mort said , ensconcing himself more comfortably , blowing smoke rings , watching them drift to the ceiling . " Anyway , business ought to be better in the spring , " Al said . " Sure it will . This is a great country , and a great age . In an age like this there is absolutely no excuse for the quitter , the loafer , and the Joe Goddard . Things are happening every day , marvels , wonders of the world . Why , look at that airplanerace from coast to coast they got on now , " Mort said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have a luxury age , " Al said philosophically . " When we do , you and I are going to sell more shoes . It 'll be good for you , handling a high-class expensive line of shoes like you do . " " My shoes are not expensive , if you consider the cost of production , the material , the workmanship that goes into them . Now one number we got . . . " " I know that , Al . I meant expensive for the average pocketbook . Like most of my customers . They do n't want to pay five , ten , twelve dollars for shoes . Well , when the luxury age comes , they will . And then Mort Goodwin 's Classy Shoe Store will spread all over the block downtown , Al . " " I suppose that you boys are selling shoes again , " Mrs. Goodwin laughed , coming into the parlor . " We was only waiting for you to come in , Alice . Say , how about tickling a few keys for us ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , let 's have some fine old-time songs , " Al said . " Mort , you know I do n't play well enough to exhibit myself in company , " she said demurely . " Say , I 'll wager that you 're an exquisite pianist , " Al said . " Al , you can bet your boots on it , and you wo n't go wrong . There is n't a little lady on this whole block that can ticklep105more heartache out of those keys than my little lady there can . " Al , I know you wo n't agree with him if you hear me , " she said . " She 's just bashful , Al . " " We 'll be charmed to hear you , " Al said . " If you insist . But it 's your asking , " she said , sitting down at the piano . She began with The Rosary . Al hummed , and Mort nodded his head to the tune . Soon they were standing over her , reading the words over her shoulder , singing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment , became dreamy , their eyes misty , faraway . They sang old-time songs yearningly . About nine-thirty Al left . Walking back to the car line , h ( , thought of home , wondered how they were there , wished his trip were over , hoped some day to have as happy a home as Mort , with his own little kids in it . He looked at the bungalows , lights cracking through drawn shades . In every one of these houses , perhaps , there was a home . People happy with their families , the home a shrine . Perhaps in these homes love shot its arrows of bliss into every heart . Now , if Norah ? . . . He wondered about Mother , and Peg , and the lad . From far away he heard the melancholy notes of a train whistle . He walked along humming to himself.  |p106Now  , Brother , you make an A this way , " Aunt Margaret 1 . ' y said , sitting with him before sheets of paper on the dining-roomtable and slowly writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of the pencil in his mouth , studied his aunt 's writing , seriously and slowly attempted to copy it . " Peg , you should n't have bought all those things for me and the home . Sure , I did n't need such grand lace caps you bought me , " the grandmother said , rocking away , darning Danny 's socks , looking over the five-and-ten-cent-store glasses which were pushed down toward the top of her beaked nose . " Mother dear , I love to do things for you , and buy things for you and the home . And Al works so hard , I love to help him out with the expenses when I can . Al deserves a good home . He works so hard , " Peg said . " The likes of my Al never walked the face of the earth , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " And Lizz needed money so bad . I gave her twenty-five dollars and bought things for her kids . They are such dears , " Peg said . " Look , Aunty Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now what comes next after an A ? " " B , " he said proudly . " Now , Brother , how do you make a B ? " " Like this , " he said , scrawling out an awkward suggestion of a capital B. " Fine ! Try it again and see if you can make it a little nicer and neater , " she said while Danny looked up at her with blue eyes that begged praise . He stuck the pencil in his mouth and earnestly tried again . " That 's much better , " she said , bending down , kissing his light brown curly hair . " Is n't it wonderful , Peg , the things that people can do nowadays , with their schooling and their automobiles , and with steam heat and electricity , and nearly everybody being able to read what 's in the newspapers ? " " I 'll read you the papers when I finish with the little one , " Peg said . " My poor mother , may the Lord have mercy on her belovedsoul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the things that they do nowadays ? Indeed , she would n't believe her own eyes . Ah , God is a wonderful Man to be giving such things to people , letting them read what 's going on in the newspapers . " I 'll read them to you right away , " said Peg . " No hurry , Peg , I have to be darning the holes in my grandson 's stockings . " " It 's little schooling that I had , damn little . Anything I know I learned and earned for myself , " Margaret said dreamily , but with bitterness underscoring her words . " I know what comes after B , Aunty Margaret , " Danny said , gazing innocently at her , causing her to return his look with a self-weary smile . " What , Brother ? " " This ! " Danny said , showing her a line of scrawled-out C 's . " And now what is after C ? " Danny frowned importantly , trying to imitate Uncle Al 's frown when his uncle seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said uncertainly , taking the pencil out of his mouth.  | " No , Brother , it 's D. " " That was what I meant to say , " Danny said as his grandmotherlooked at him with adoration , still peering over her glasses . " How do you make it ? " Danny looked up at his aunt . He watched her write out a large and clear letter D. He studiously copied it , and then waited for praise . " Good , Brother , " she yawned . " Aunty Margaret , how do I write my name ? " " Like this , " she said , and he watched her intently . His attempts to copy resulted in illegible scrawls , so his aunt guided his hand as he wrote out his name . " Now , you show Mother what you did , and how neatly you wrote your name . " " Mother , look ! That 's my name . Aunty Margaret showed me how to write it , " Danny said , handing her the sheet of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You 'll be a scholar some day , Son ! Now is n't it grand ! " she said in awe of the writing he held up to her . " He 's going to learn faster , all right , now that I am helpinghim , Mother . " " Mother , when I learn more , I 'll write your name for you , and show you how to write it . Then when you get money orders from Uncle Al , you can sign them yourself instead of having to have Aunty Margaret do it for you . " " Indeed , you wo n't . I can write my own name on my son 's money , " she said haughtily . " Brother , when you grow up to be a man , what are you going to do ? " " Gee , maybe be a baseball pitcher like Ed Walsh and pitch no-hit games . " " And are you going to be rich ? " " I 'll make lots and lots of money . This whole room full of money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to take care of and buy presents for ? " " You and Mother . " " Ah , I 'll be rotted in my grave then , " the grandmother soliloquized . " You wo n't , Mother , because I 'm going to buy you a great big shiny automobile . " " Brother , Aunty Margaret is tired now and she has things to do . She 'll help you another time , " the aunt said . " Aunty Margaret ? " Danny said as she got up from her chair . " What , Brother ? " " Read me my letter from Uncle Al again . " " Some other time . Your aunt is tired . " " No ! Now ! " he said imperiously , pulling out the crumpledletter from his pocket and handing it to her . " Read it , Peg . I want to hear it meself , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " Brother , you 're so sweet . But you 're a trial to your tired aunt , " she said , taking the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are being an obedient boy and doing what your aunt and grandmother tell you to at home and what your teacher and the Sisters tell you to do in school . You want to be a real sport and a real sport obeys his superiors . When you study you must think of your studies and , when you play you should think of play . And in school , and at home , listen to how those older than you speak and try to speak like them and develop a better diction . And do n't forget to say yes mam to your teacher . Be good now . Sport . Your uncle , AOF " My uncle sent that to me and it 's all for me , " said Danny.  | " He thinks so much of you . You must be good now as he says , " Peg said . " Indeed , Al does think of his nephew . Al thinks that nothingis too good for him , " the grandmother said , raising her voice in pride . " I 'll be so good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , I can write letters to Uncle Al when he 's away on the road , ca n't I , Aunty Margaret ? " " Yes , Brother . And Al will be so proud of you then . " " He will , wo n't he ? " " Peg ? " the grandmother said . " Yes , Mother ? " " Any murders in the paper tonight ? " the mother asked , her eyes alight . " I have to do some things in my room , and then I 'll read them to you . " She left the room . Talking to himself , Danny scrawled on the paper , copying from the alphabet at the beginning of his first-grade reader . The grandmother resumed her darning , still looking over her glasses as she worked . Puffing on a cork-tipped Egyptian cigarette , Peg strode thoughtfully and nervously back and forth in her room . She suddenly wrung her hands . She paused before the mirror and studied her handsome , worried face . She tried to look tragic . Ah , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life looking at her out of the dusty mirror . Her cigarette was almost burningher lips . She went to the chamber pot under her bed , took off the lid , dropped the butt in , and there was a sizz as it was extinguished . She quickly put the lid back on , and made a face . Filled , too . She would have to be emptying it in the bathroom . But she wanted to get that letter written first . She sat down at her small and disorderly desk in the corner , brushed things aside , began writing , destroying sheets of paper , rewriting , destroying more sheets , and then writing out a short letter quickly , and in a graceful handwriting.  |p111Dear  Mr. RobinsonBusiness conditions are not very favorable at present , and it seems as if they will get worse unless something is done . I thought I better write to you to give you this information . It will be imperative that something be done to cause a turn for the better immediatelySincerely yoursJ . S. OlsonShe addressed the envelope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get her some money from Lorry . She had spent so much buying things for the house , and helping Lizz , and she had n't even spent a penny on her own poor self . And she had taken a hundred dollars from her petty cashbox , too . She had to put it back before there was any audit . Here she was , bonded , risking her bond . If she got caught , she could never get another job . She was risking the blacklist for her family . And did they appreciate it ? Did Jim O'Neill , that long-legged , bucktoothed teamster show gratitude ? Well , she had learned something from hard and bitter experience in life . She had learned that there was no gratitude , no gratitude , in the human heart . None whatever ! And money ! Oh , God , the very idea of it would some day drive her crazy . She looked over the envelope . She kissed the name she had written on it . If she could only see him tonight , he with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong arms of his , have him undress her , spill himself into her , oh , God . She smiled suddenly , sadly , hearing her nephew talk to his grandmother . Such sweet sounds . If only she and Lorry had a beautiful child of their own like Little Brother ! Instead , that poor thing , born a bastard , put in an institution for the feeble-minded . Oh , God , oh , God , oh , God , was there no justice in the world ! She walked back to the dining room . " Peg , any murders in the paper tonight ? " " I have n't looked . I have to go down to the corner to mail a letter . I 'll get the latest edition and come back right away and read it to you . " " Aunty Margaret , can I go with you ? " " No , Brother , it 's cold out , and you must study . " " I want to go with you ! " " What did Uncle Al write , Brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? " " Gee . . . . Will you bring me back some candy ? " " Yes , you little darling ! " she said , kissing him . Peg walked rapidly along Calumet Avenue toward FiftyfirstStreet . It was a cold and frosty night , and a mist hung over the apartment buildings along the street . A carriage crunched past her . She heard the rumbling elevated trains . Ahead of her , she could see the not-too-brightly-lighted window of O'Callahan 's saloon at the northwest corner of Fiftyfirstand Calumet . Suddenly a westbound street car flashed in front of her . It was an Indiana Avenue car , and it would turn on to Indiana , and go downtown . It made her remember how once when she and poor Louise had been going downtown in the afternoon , Little Brother had followed them , dirty-faced and crying . He had climbed on the car with them , and they had had to take the little darling along , just as he was . Danny had loved Louise so . He used to call her his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little darling angel . It was so sad when she was dying . The little angel did not know it , and he was shouting and making noise , and Louise was in the side bedroom  --  dying . Poor Louise , she had been so pale and beautiful on her deathbed , her lovely long brown hair , and her blue eyes that men liked so much , and her lovely face , like glass , and so colorless . Lorry had once said Louise was a fine girl . It had made her so jealous of Louise . Ah , had she known , had she known what sad fate was bound to overtake poor Louise , she would never , never , never have been jealous . Walking more slowly , she began to think of how muchp113she loved Lorry , and how she wanted only to be with him forever . Two boys passed , shouting and swearing at one another . Her lips curled . Nasty little runts ! Not like her darling nephew . A man , wearing an overcoat with a velvet collar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She knew , as she walked on , that he had turned to look after her . Well , if he wanted to look at her ass moving when she walked , let him , the poor goddamn fish . Yes , she was glowingly pleased to be a handsome woman , handsome enough to have little pikers oogle after her . They would come with their tongues hanging out , too , if she gave them the chance . But why should she ? She who knew men , gentlemen , men who were rich , Lorry . Lorry , what was he doing at this minute ? Might he , right now , be thinking of her , wanting her , wishing that he was with her here in Chicago ? Or would he be thinking of that creature ? The mere thought of that goddamn wife of his made her want to puke . Think of it , Lorry , her lovely Lorry , in bed with that skinny bitch of a wife ! Think of it ! Oh , God ! Yes , yes , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't that bitch die ? She was no good , no good on earth . " Peg O'Flaherty ! How are you , darling ? I 'm so glad to see you . " " As I live and die , Martha Morton , " Peg answered , and the two women kissed . They faced each other , smiling . Martha was a frowsy , blown woman , with a large and flowery hat , a fur coat , a wrinkled , painted face , thick crass lips , circles under her stupid blue eyes , and piles and layers of red hair . " Peg , my dear , let 's go some place where we can sit down and talk , " Martha said . " Just as soon as I get a stamp and drop an important letter in the box , " Peg said , and she left Martha to enter the drug store on the corner . She came out immediately , and dropped the letter in the mailbox . They crossed the car tracks , walked down the side of O'Callahan 's saloon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a corner table in the small , dimly lit room , with its damp smell , its scattered tables with oilcloth coverings , its pictures of hefty actresses on the walls . It was connected with the saloon proper by swinging doors , through which they could hear echoes of male talk , sudden bursts of masculine laughter . " How have you been , Martha ? " Peg asked when they were comfortably seated . " Peg , it 's a terribly long story . Peg , my dear , my heart has just been eaten out . But how have you been , dear heart ? Tell me what has been happening to you ? Do you ever see that little runt , Older , any more ? " " That ! That ! That ! " Peg sneered . They smiled at each other , a mutual feminine contempt for a male . They laughed . A waiter appeared , and they ordered beer . " Oh , Martha , I ca n't go on tolerating it much longer . All the weight of responsibility that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you poor dear thing ! Peg , I always said that you had too kind a heart . I always told you that . " " I wo n't much longer . Martha , I am thinking of clearing out , bag and baggage . I love my family , and my lovely darling mother , but Martha , oh , a family is such a burden on a poor girl 's shoulders . " " Peg , you can love your family . But I do n't love mine . Jesus Christ , I most certainly do n't . I would be a different woman today , a different woman , if it was n't for the family I had . My father , he screwed me when I was thirteen . Can you imagine that ? I was only a little girl who hardly knew how to pee and that 's what my father did to me . " " My family is such a burden . My poor brother , Al , he means well , but he is such a mollycoddle . With a man like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of my own . " " I know how bad he is . Did n't he have that nasty little nephew of yours tell me that he did n't want me in your housep115when I lived over you on Indiana ? I know what he is . But he is n't as bad , he ca n't be as bad , as a father who screwed his own thirteen-year-old daughter . " " My poor father . He was such a good man , such a hardworkingman , so badgered and nagged . And he was so sick , dying from cancer . Well , poor dead Dad , he has gone to hie reward with God at last . And he is better off , better off , maybe , than his poor daughter who loved him so much . " " Well , he was not like that rat I had for an old man . Peg , did you ever hear of a father doing to his thirteen-year-old daughter what mine did to me ? " " It 's just that my family is too big a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brother , Al , I wish that he would just go and clear out and get married . He 's such a mollycoddle , " Peg said . " I 'll bet he 's just like Mr. Morton . Well , Mr. Morton learned some things . He learned that Martha Morton could n't be dictated to . " " That 's been my trouble . I let them dictate to me . But they wo n't continue to ! They wo n't ! They wo n't ! " " Do n't let them , honey , " Martha said , frowning harshly and reaching across the table to touch Peg 's arm . " Why , Martha , do you know that I ca n't even have a friend without them asking me questions in that goddamn snooping way of theirs ? Where have you been ? What have you been doing ? Who were you with ? Martha , I 'm of age , and it 's none of their goddamn business ! " " Peg , you 're right . You 're of age , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Peg , it 's because of that five-and-ten-cent edition of a man you call your brother that you 'll never see me in your house as long as there is breath in my body . He insulted me as no man ever did . He did n't want me in his home . Well , I tell you I never went in it because of him . " " I 'm so wearied of it . I tell you , Martha , I ca n't have a friend .

Then we make the men pay , " Martha said as if she were telling a dark secret , and they drank in agreement on Martha 's sentiment . " Martha , I got to get away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who is he ? Another clown ? "  | " He is n't a clown ! " Peg glared . " Peg , dearie , " Martha said quickly in a soft and persuasive voice , reaching over to pet Margaret 's hand as she spoke . " Peg , darling , I 'm sorry . I did n't know . I just did n't know . " " I understand , Martha . But my Lorry is different . He 's my sweetheart . He is going to be a great man some day . " " Has he got plenty of onions in the bank ? " " He 's a millionaire . A millionaire ! A millionaire ! And he 's going to marry me as soon as he gets his divorce . " " Peggy ! " Martha shouted , arising , running around the table to embrace Margaret . " Darling ! " she said , her arms still enfolding Margaret , her beery breath whiffing into Margaret 's nostrils . They kissed . Breathless , Martha again sat down . They drank . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden cutting glare coming into her eyes , and Margaret , catching this look , smiled sweetly back , reached over , squeezed her friend 's hand , and they finished off their steins , ordering new ones . " Lorry is so kind and so gentle . He is such a wonderful man . He 's too good for this world , " Peg said sentimentally , her eyes dreamy and far-off , so that she did not catch the cynical curl of Martha 's lips . " I wish I had a man like that , " Martha said as the waiter set new steins before them . " I wish I did , " Martha said , drinking . " If I had the right man , I would settle down . I would keep home . I would slave for him . But I never met a man who was worth the tiniest part of a woman 's toenail . Now take that runt , Mr. Morton . What good was he ? He was n't worth a fart in bed . And do you know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars a month . " " Most men are little pikers like that hawk-nosed brother of mine , " Peg said bitterly , drinking after her remark . " Peg , I speak the truest words ever said when I tell you that most men are n't worth the tiniest part of a woman 's toenail . " " Pikers ! " Peg said , and they finished their beer and ordered still more which the waiter brought promptly . " Oh , Peg darling , do n't cry , do n't ! " Martha said , beginningp119to sway in her chair and to see Margaret in tears through bleary eyes . Her voice became thickly sweet . " I 'm unhappy , too , my Peg . " " My family will ruin my life , " Peg said while Martha drew a handkerchief from her hefty pocketbook , wiped her eyes , and then loudly blew her nose . " That 's what Mr. Morton did to my life , " Martha said in a contemptuous tone , and , drooling , they drank from their steins . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lovely flower of a girl when I met Mr. Morton . Mr. Morton and those fine promises of his , kneeling before me , saying he loves me , calling me his tootsie-wootsie . And what did he do when I , innocent thing that I was , when I believed him ? Why , I did n't even get one decent night in bed from him . " Her face became hard , firm . " Well , I tied a can to that funny little ass of his , goddamn it if I did n't ! " " Sometimes , Martha , I get so nervous , and everything seems dark , and goes black before me . And I think of ending it all , " Margaret said after they had more beer . " Peg , so do I. " " Martha , if I had n't met you tonight , oh , I might have done it . Martha , you 're such an understanding friend . " " Girls like us , Peg , should be understanding to each other . Walking along tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars . Suppose I just fling myself under one of them . Who will care ? Who will miss poor . Martha Morton ? Nobody ! Nobody ! But then , the world would know of the perfidy of Mr. Morton . I almost did it , dearie . " They drank more beer . They cried . They decided to leave . Martha made no effort to pay . Peg paid the bill . Arm in arm , they left the saloon and staggered to the corner of Fifty-first and Calumet . A carriage with two men in top hats stopped by the curb . They entered the carriage . The elevated driver lightly applied the whip . As the horse broke into a trot , Martha and Peg were heard singing drunkenly ,  | Come on and hear , come on and hear , Alexander 's ragtime band . Come on and hear , it 's the best band in the land.  | WHAT did she do ? " Bill asked as he and Danny sat on the lower ledge of the back stairway , looking out onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass by the narrow sidewalk that ran to the few steps at the alley gate . " Oh , she came home awful late , and she hollered so loud that the people on the second floor below us hammered on the radiator for her to shut up . And Mother woke up , and tried to get her to go to bed and not yell so much , and she and Mother had a fight , and she cursed Mother , " Danny said , spitting through the stair railing . " She was drunk , " Bill said knowingly . " When I came home from school for dinner today she was crying and walking around the house , saying she was awful nervous , " Danny said , trying to seem as knowing as Bill . " Pa does n't yell so much as Aunt Margaret when he comes home drunk . But after little Catherine was born , Ma made him go see the Italian priest and take the pledge again , " Bill said . " Mother says it 's a sin against God to drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and makes noise , too , when she drinks too much of it , " Danny said , again trying to spit through the stair railing , his saliva missing , striking against the wood and slipping slowly downward . " Mama says the same thing to Papa , and she says that Uncle Al never drinks , and then Papa gets sore and tells her he does n't give a damn what her dude brother does , " Bill said , pulling a long cigarette butt from his pocket , squeezing offp122the used edge and lighting it . " I hope Mother does n't catch me smoking , " he added mysteriously . " She 's upstairs working . But gee , Bill , I wish you could stay for supper , " Danny said . " It 's starting to get dark and I got to go . Pa said I got to be home for supper . " " Gee , I wish you could stay . We could talk about baseball . " " Pa said for me to be home when he left for work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sore , and I might get a whaling with his razor strap , and it hurts a hell of a lot , " Bill said . " Gee whiskers ! " A grocery wagon clattered down the alley toward Fiftieth Street . " Danny ! " the grandmother called shrilly from the porch up on the third landing . " Daniel ! Daniel ! " " Here I am , Mother , " Danny said , running out from under the stairs so she could see him . " I 'm with Bill . " " Daniel ! Daniel ! " " Here I am , Mother , " he shrieked . " Do n't get your little self cold , Son . " That woman living under them looked down at Danny , then up at the grandmother . From one of the yards down the alley a dog was heard barking . " Bill , Aunty Margaret saw that awful woman who lived under us on Indiana that Uncle Al said could n't come in the house , " Danny said ingratiatingly , because he felt Bill would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill to like him , and praise him . " Mama was telling Papa that Mrs. Morton is getting divorcedfrom her husband , and Mama said it was awful . Pa said he did n't want to hear what such people were doing , " Bill said , inhaling , letting the smoke out his nostrils . " What is that , to get divorced ? Aunty Margaret talks about people getting that , too , " Danny said with added interest . " It means a man wo n't live with his wife any more . "  | " Why ? "  --  " Jesus , Dan , you do n't know your rump from a hole in the ground , do you ? " Bill said contemptuously , shooting his butt several yards as he spoke . " It means a man wo n't live with his wife any more , and he wo n't make babies with her . " " God makes babies , does n't He , and gives them to their father and mother , like He just did when he gave Mama and Papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know ! " " That 's so . Aunty Margaret told me . " " Daniel ! Daniel ! Daniel ! " " Yes , Mother , " Danny said , again running out from under the stairs . " Do n't go ' way , Son ! It 's getting late . " " Yes , Mother . I 'm talking to Bill right here , " he yelled , his voice rising above the sounds of another wagon passing in the alley . " That 's all you know about babies a " Bill said , almost sneering . " Aunty Margaret told me that when I asked her . " " You 're too young a punk to know any better . " " Why ? " Danny said , pained by Bill 's scorn . " When you get older , I 'll tell you how babies are made . " " Please tell me , Bill . " " You 're too young , and you 'd snitch on me if I did . " " Why ? Is there something bad about knowing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know what I do , " Bill boasted . " Tell me , please , Bill . " " You 're too young . " " Here , Bill , I 'll give you this if you tell me . It 's all I got . Mother gave it to me today , " Danny said , handing Bill a nickel he had just dug out of his trouser pocket . " You 're too young to know , but I 'll tell you , " Bill said , taking the nickel . " But if you ever say I told you , I 'll lam the shit out of you.  | " I wo n't , Bill . " " When Pa and Ma want a baby , they go to bed . And there is a hole in all women where they pee , and Pa puts his dick into Ma 's hole . " " And does he pee into her , and does that make a baby ? That 's funny . I do n't believe it . You 're teasing me . God makes babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , call me a liar . I 'll never tell you anything else . Here , take your lousy nickel back . " " I do n't want it . " " You 're just dumb , Danny . Anybody ever tell you you were dumb ? " " Bill , if you say it 's so , I 'll believe you , " Danny whimpered . " But , Bill , how can peeing in the hole make a baby ? " " White stuff called jism comes out , and that makes the baby inside of Mama . " " Gee ! " " It hurts a woman , too . " " What hurts ? " " Having the baby . The baby is inside of Mama , and Mama 's belly swells up like a balloon , and after the baby comes out of her hole she has to stay in bed for a while , and when little Catherine came out of her that way , gee , there were a lot of bloody rags that Papa threw in the garbage pail . " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't God make it another way ? " " I heard Mama talking to Pa about it , and they did n't know I was listening . Mama said it is a punishment of God . When Adam and Eve were made by God , God said to them that they ca n't do that , and they did , so God said to them they had sinned , and women would always have to have babies in pain and suffering that way . " " Aunty Margaret and Miss Devlin at school said they ate an apple . " " They did , and they did this thing , too . Only they do n't tell kids about this , because kids are n't supposed to know it . "  | " Daniel ! Daniel ! Daniel ! " " Here I am , Mother . " " Do n't let your little feet get cold ! " " I wo n't , Mother . Honest I wo n't . I 'm all right . " " The hurt only happens , Danny , when the baby comes out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pecker in Mama . Women are supposed to like a man to do that with them . I heard that from the kids older than me at school . " " Do all women like it ? Do they all do it ? " " I guess so . But it 's a sin , unless the man and woman are married . " " Is that why Ma and Pa are married ? " " Uh huh ! " " Gee , I never knew that , " Danny said , and another wagon passed in the darkening alley . " Ca n't they do it together if they ai n't married ? " " It 's a sin . If a woman let 's a man put his pecker in her , and she ai n't his wife , it 's a sin . " " Gee ! " Danny exclaimed , quizzically scratching his head " It 's supposed to be a lot of fun , " Bill said . " Can I do it , too ? " " You got to get big down here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day I 'll have hair like Uncle Al has ? " " Everybody does . I 'm starting to already . Sometimes kids like it with girls . Down on La Salle Street , a cop caught some kids doing it with a girl . They were all naked in a barn . There was hell to pay , and I heard Mama telling Papa that they might be put away in reform school . " " That 's funny . And God made it , too , did n't he ? " " You saphead , God made everything . " " I know it . It 's in my catechism lesson . It says , Why did God make you ? And I know the answer . God made me to know Him , to love Him , and to serve Him in this world , and be happy with Him in the next . " " You belong in the first seat at the head of the class , " Bill sneered.  | " Gee , I never knew about that thing . " " It 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They sat in silence . Danny wondered , should he tell Bill how he and Little Margaret had played doctor that day over in the house on Forty-eighth and Indiana , and he had played that Little Margaret had been kidnaped , and tied up so tight with ropes by the kidnapers that every part of her was hurt , and he was the doctor coming to examine her , and he had lifted up her dress first thing and touched her with a card from a deck of cards , but he 'd been afraid to touch her with his fingers . And Aunty Margaret had come in the bedroom , and she had seemed worried , and asked them had they done anything else , and she was less worried when they told her no they had n't . Now he knew what it was . Aunty Margaret had been afraid he had peed in Little Margaret . Gee , the next time that Little Margaret was up to see them , and they were alone , he wanted to play some more doctor with her . They sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to talk to him any more . Gee , he wished he was as big as Bill . " I got to grab a street car and get home , " Bill said , gettingup . Danny sadly watched Bill walk in the growing darkness to the alley gate . He heard Bill whistling after Bill was out of sight . He felt afraid now , with the darkness . He might be kidnaped or something . " Daniel ! Daniel ! Daniel ! " " I 'm coming , Mother , " he said , starting to run up the stairs . " Daniel ! DANIEL ! DANIEL ! " Usually when his grandmother went out like this at night , he was terribly afraid of burglars and Blackhands , or that somebody might hurt Mother and he would never see herp127again . And he loved Mother , he guessed , even more than he did his Mama . But he was n't so afraid now , because he wanted to think about what Bill told him , and he wanted to think about himselfpeeing babies in girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousin , Catherine Nolan , and girls in school , and Hortense Audrey , the girl he liked so much . When he grew up he would like to marry her , only she was n't a Catholic , and Mother and all of them said that you should n't marry anyone who was a Protestant . But Bill had said that doing it without being marriedwas a sin , but gosh , he could n't help it , because he had just this wish in him that he could go around doing it to one girl , and then to another girl , and he wished that God would make it so that he could do it without it being a sin , even if it was a sin for everybody else . He wished that God would make him just as God made Himself , and then , like God , he could n't do anything that was a sin . He unbuttoned his pants , and looked at himself in the parlor mirror , hearing the rumble of an elevated train as if from a distance . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God made boys and girls different . Now why , he wondered , did God give this thing to boys , and something else to girls ? And why had God had to fix it that babies were born the way Bill said they were ? Gee , that was funny , he told himself , scratching his head . He went closer to the mirror to study himself , because he could see so much better if he was up closer to it . He wanted God to give him right away a pecker as big as Uncle Al 's . He fingered himself with self-indulgent pleasure . He looked from the mirror to himself , and back again . He wished that he could go around everywhere like this , without his pants having to be buttoned up , so that everybody could see him just like he saw himself in the mirror. lie turned thoughtfully away from the mirror and pretendedthat of all the people in the world he only was allowed by God to walk around with his pants not buttoned . He wasp128like a king in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a king and a whole parade by himself . He walked around the edges of the reddish patterned carpet , telling himself that he was the king of everybody , and he walked around like he was a whole parade by himself , and every time he felt like it , he stopped and peed a baby into some girl who was one of his subjects . Leaving the parlor , he stopped at the hall tree , and imagined that he was peeing a baby into his cousin , Catherine Nolan . He moved down the dim hallway , stopping again to imagine that he was peeing a baby into Hortense Audrey . He halted at the entrance to the dining room . He started back , playing that he was the king of everybody , with a purple crown on his head and a purple robe over his shoulder , and no clothes where his pants should be buttoned up . He held out his hands as if he were holding a trumpet , and he filled his checks with air until they swelled and then let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becausethe king was parading with his pecker out . And on both sides of the street girls lined up to watch the king , waiting for him to pee babies into them . And it would not be a sin , either , when he did it , because God let him do it without calling it a sin on him . But God would n't let anybody else do it without it being a sin . The bell rang . He quickly buttoned his pants and , disappointed , he pressed the buzzer to open the downstairs door . He opened the door and waited , hearing his grandmother ascending . " Son ? " she called . " Yes , Mother , " he said innocently . " Arc you all right ? " " Yes , Mother . " He watched her coming up the final flights , wearing her knitted black shawl and carrying a can of beer . " I hurried back so you would be all right . And I got this to wet me whistle , " she said , holding up the can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed him , but he did n't like the kiss because of her beery breath . " Your uncle will be coming home soon and I wo n't be able to be getting out like this again , so I thought I would get this and wet me whistle , " she added , entering the apartment , Danny slamming the door behind her . " Hurry , now , and get your breakfast eaten so you wo n't be late for the Sisters , Son , " the grandmother said , setting soft-boiled eggs before Danny as he sat down to his breakfast , rubbing his sleepy eyes with his knuckles . " Aunty Margaret thought that she would get up early and have a cup of coffee with Brother , " the aunt said , seated oppositehim in a pink kimono . " Peg , you do n't work today ? " the mother asked . " I 'm off because I worked Sunday . I 'm going to give the house a good cleaning to have it all spick and span for Al . It 's a shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was going to be here in time for supper , I 'd cook the most delicious meal for him . " " I 'm going to bake some fresh bread for my son , " the mother said . " Now eat your eggs there , Brother , dear , " Aunt Margaret said . " Mother , are you my mother , or is my Mama my mother ? " Danny suddenly asked , his lips stained with egg . " Why , what do you mean , Brother ? " " I 'm his mother , " the grandmother said . " If you are , then I came out of your hole instead of my Mama 's ? " he asked . " Why , Danny , what are you saying ? " the aunt said , so puzzled that she held her cup of coffee suspended in mid-air . " Peg , Peg , what 's the little fellow saying ? " " Well , Bill said to me that everybody is born that way ,  |p130and  if Mother is my mother , then I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Glory be ! " the grandmother said , blessing herself . " Brother , what are you talking about ? " " I was only saying what Bill said to me , " Danny said naively . " He did . Only let me get my hands on him ! He did ! " the grandmother shouted in blind anger . " Brother , that is a bad thing to say . You must not talk like that , " the aunt said . " Ooh , let me get these hands on him . I 'll cut his eyes out with a butcher knife , " the grandmother said . " Well , Bill , he told me that men pee into women , and that makes babies , and down on La Salle Street a policeman found a lot of boys doing that to a little girl in a barn , and they were all naked , " Danny said . " Jesus Mary and Joseph , may all your curses cripple him for saying such things to my grandson ! " the grandmother shrieked dramatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin , and a sweet little fellow like you must never again say that , or your aunty and grandmotherwill have to wash your mouth out with soap , " the aunt said , and while she spoke the grandmother rushed into her room , grabbed the holy-water fount from her wall , returned , and sprinkled holy water around . " Is it a sin , Aunty Margaret ? " " It 's an awful sin , and it would make you burn in Hell . Promise your aunty you 'll never again think or talk like that . " " I will . I was n't saying it myself . I was only telling you what Bill told me , and asking you , " he said . " God bless my soul , but I 'll never rest in a night 's peace until I can lay these hands on him , " the grandmother said slowly , seriously , her beaked face intense with passion . " What did Bill say to you , Brother ? " " What I told you , " Danny said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of him the way grownupsalway did . " Peg , I 'll rip the tongue out of his mouth ! Telling such things to an innocent baby . If his father do n't beat him , I 'll slit his father 's ears with the butcher knife ! " the grandmother said , nervously dancing and hopping around the kitchen . " Just what was it ? " " Peg , call Lizz ! I 'll scratch his eyes out . I 'll tear the flesh off him and feed it to dogs in the alley ! " " Go ahead , Brother , you tell Aunty Margaret everything . " " I did n't do nothing , " Danny pouted . " We know , Brother . We wo n't hurt you . But tell us what else Bill said to you . " " That 's all . He said that 's how babies were made . " " Brother , promise me you 'll never think or speak of this again . " " I wo n't , Aunty Margaret , because it 's a sin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " " Peg , " the grandmother interrupted , " we got to get the boy off to school . " " Yes , because we have catechism first , and Miss Devlin says none of us should be late and miss anything from the catechism lesson . She said if we do , our guardian angel puts a black mark against us in his book . " " Hurry up and finish your breakfast , Danny , " the aunt said . " Oh , Blessed Virgin Mary , give strength to these arms that I might chop that one with a hatchet , him saying things not meant for the ears of a baby , " the grandmother said , as if in prayer . Danny marched out of school in his regular place in line , thinking how at home they would blame Bill and tell Uncle A I. And Uncle Al would sock Bill , and Bill would be sore at him then . And gee , he had n't meant to tell them what he did . The words had just slipped out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , and now , gosh , how would he be able to make Bill believe that he had n't been a snitcher . The children marched out of the small , fenced-in schoolyard , and the line dispersed at the gate leading onto Fiftieth Street at the alley . As Danny crossed the alley beside the schoolyard , there were kids all around him , walking , running , talking , shouting , wrestling . Artie Lenehan , a plump boy of seven , who always threw spitballs and made trouble in the schoolroom , came up to him . " Sissy ! " Artie said . " You go ' way , and let me ' lone . I 'm not doing nothing to you , " Danny said . " Sissy ! Wears white stockings . Sissy ! " " I ai n't a sissy . " " Wears white stockings on Sunday ! Wears white stockings on Sunday ! Wears white stockings on Sunday ! You 're worse than a sissy . " " What am I ? " " You 're a sonofabitch . " Danny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said about his mother . " You 're worse than a sissy , because a sonofabitch is worse than a sissy , " Artie said , standing in the center of a gang of kids who laughed at Danny . Danny got mad . He closed his eyes and blindly ripped into Artie , punching , kicking , scratching . He fell forward with his eyes closed . When he opened them , he was on top of Artie , screaming , scratching , shouting for Artie to take back what he had said , and Artie was yelling murder , and shouting that he never would . Danny was dragged off Artie by a bigger kid he did n't know . " I 'm going to tell my mother on you , " Artie screamed , his face scratched and bleeding . " You ca n't talk about my mother bad , " Danny sobbed , quivering and nervous as Artie ran away , still shouting . Danny walked home alone , his body shaken with sobs , notp133knowing even if he was walking the right way . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he was doing it in his sleep . Walking up three flights of stairway , he tried not to cry . His grandmother was at the door , and she kissed him as he stepped across the threshhold . " Son ! My Son ! You 're dinner is ready . Where were you ? " He walked ahead of her to the kitchen , and when she followed him into it she saw that his eyes were red from crying , and that his clothes were mussed . " Son , are you hurt ? Are you sick ? Who hit you ? " " No , Mudder . A boy called me a sissy . " " The little devil , who is he ? Tell me , and I 'll tear his mother 's hair out of her head . " " Artie Lenehan , who always makes trouble and does this all the time , " Danny said , lip-farting to show his grandmother what Artie always did . " Lead me to him , and I 'll flay the hide off him ! I 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No . I hit him . " " Did you scratch the little devil 's eyes out ? " the grandmothersaid , and as she spoke the bathroom toilet was heard flushing ; she folded her arms around him , kissed him , mutteredproudly , " Son ! " Peg entered the kitchen . " My grandsontore his eyes out of his head . " " What 's this ? What happened , Brother ? " " Artie Lenehan called me names , and I hit him good . " " Are you hurt , you poor little thing ? " " No . But I hurt him . I tried to scratch some of his flesh , and bring it home to mother , but it would n't come off of him , " Danny said , and the aunt laughed loudly . " Brother , it is n't nice or gentlemanly to fight like that . " " Tear their eyes out ! " the grandmother said . " Why , Mother ! " exclaimed Margaret . " Come , Son , sit down and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to wash my hands , do I ? I 'll be late for school , " Danny said.  | " Here , Aunty will do it for you , " the aunt said , taking him to the sink and quickly washing his hands while the grandmother nervously bustled about the table . " If any of those little devils touches a hair on your head , you tell them you 'll get your grandmother after them , " she said . " I beat him up . " " Come , drink your soup while it 's hot , " the grandmother said . ' Sitting in the classroom , he thought of how , gee , he was always a little bit afraid when Uncle Al came home , and always a little bit glad when he went away . Because when Uncle Al was around , Danny did not know when Uncle Al would go losing his temper , and bawling him out or socking him . He looked around the room , and he thought of how when he was marching up in line , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good the way he went and socked Artie Lenehan . He did n't care , Artie had no right to call his mother an awful name . There was a knock on the door . The eyes of nearly every child in the room were turned toward the door . They saw . Sister Marguerita 's head , framed in the stiff white headpiece and black-hooded veiling of her order . She and Miss Devlin talked . " Daniel O'Neill , " Miss Devlin called , turning from the opened door , the nun still standing there . He looked toward his teacher , afraid . They were new nearly all looking at him . " Daniel , I am calling you , " Miss Devlin said . " Yes , mam , " he replied timidly . " Sister Marguerita wants you . " He knew that something was wrong , and it must be because of Artie Lenehan . It had n't been his fault , either . Hep135looked hesitantly at his teacher , while she motioned for him to come forward . That woman ! " Come here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nun , and her voice was not as angry as Miss Devlin 's had been . " I want to speak with you in the office , " Sister Marguerita added as he walked down the aisle of desks , toward the nun . " Yes , Sister , " he said spiritlessly as he followed her out of the room and down the corridor , hearing the heavy rattle of the long beads she wore and the swish of her clothing . They passed into Sister Marguerita 's small office which was overcrowded with furniture , statues of saints , and holy pictures . Danny looked down at the green carpet . He knew all right that something was up because there were two fat women sitting on each side of the desk , looking as if they were really sore . The nun sat down , faced him . He halted about eight feet away , pale and breathing a little hard . " Daniel , were you fighting ? " Sister Marguerita asked in a surprisingly stern voice . Gee , he liked Sister Marguerita all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to him . He squirmed . He could n't talk . " Daniel , answer me ! Were you fighting ? " " Yes , Sister , " he replied in a half-whisper . " Come closer to me , " the nun commanded , and he took a careful step forward , muttering inarticulately . " Closer ! " He took a few more steps . " Here , come right up before the desk . . . Now answer me ! Why were you fighting ? " Maybe he could talk if the two fat women were not there , with their mean faces . They seemed to look at him like they did n't like him , all right . He guessed that one of them must be Artie 's mother , and the other something like his aunt . Well , if they put a hand on him , he would tell Mother , and she would come and tear their darn old eyes out , she would . " Answer me , Daniel ! Speak ! I wo n't swallow you , " the Sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you scratch and beat up Arthur Lenehan ? He was n't able to come to school this afternoon . " " He . . . called me a name . " " Sister , " said the fat woman on the right , " Sister , I do n't think he 's telling the truth . He 's lying . My Arthur told me that he just hit and scratched him with absolutely no provocation , and my little Arthur never lies . He 's just the bestbehavedand the most mannerly child . He would n't even call a flea a name . My neighbor here , Mrs. Stone , she 'll vouch for every word I am saying . " " He called me a sissy because I wear white stockings , " Danny said while Mrs. Stone continued nodding her head in affirmation of Mrs. Lenehan 's statement . " Daniel , are n't you a little man ? You are in school now , and you should n't be fighting over such little things . " " Sister , he called me something else , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell you . " " Why ca n't you , Daniel ? " " It 's too bad and awful . " " Daniel , surely you can tell me . " " No , I ca n't , Sister , " Danny said , nodding intently . " Why ? " ? " I ca n't say it . It would be a sin . " " It wo n't be a sin to say it now to me . Tell me . " " No , Sister . I 'm afraid . I 'm afraid to say it . It was an awful word about my mother . " " Sister , it 's not so . My little Arthur , coming from the home we give him , he could n't say anything like that . Why , he does n't even know such words because he never hears them at home , " Mrs. Lenehan said . " Sister , I did n't want to fight . He called me names . " " Daniel , you must listen to me . I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do , I 'll send for your grand/mother . She 's one who might be able to take care of you if you carry on as you did this noon . " " Yes , Sister , " Danny said , hoping that she would let him go so he would n't have to have the two fat women looking at him as if maybe they even wanted to chew him up or something . He felt funny , as if there were two Danny O'Neills , one of them on the outside of something like a box , and the other Danny O'Neill on the inside . And the inside one of himself seemed to be getting smaller and shrinking , and getting smaller , and still smaller , and he was just awful afraid , and he wanted to get away from here , with these two mean old fat women . He did n't like them , he did n't , and he wanted Sister Marguerita to let him go . " Daniel , you must promise me something , " Sister Margueritasaid . He knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what she was saying , and all he knew was that he was afraid , and there she was , and she seemed to be very far away from him behind her big desk . " Daniel , do n't you hear me ? " Sister Marguerita said , her voice sharper , so that her words cut through his confusion like a light knifing a fog . " Answer me ! " she said sternly while he feebly nodded his head . " Yes , Sister . " " I want you to promise me that you wo n't fight any more , and that if you have any trouble with any of the other boys you will come and tell me about it instead of fighting . I cannotlet you boys be fighting . You must act like little gentlemen . Do you understand me ? " " Yes . . . I mean , yes , Sister , " he said awkwardly . " Sister , he scratched my little Arthur up so badly that I could n't let him go to school this afternoon . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic school , " Mrs.Lenehan said , her fat face bloating with contorted indignation.  | " I 'm . . . sorry , " Danny meekly said . " After acting the way you did , Daniel , if you were not sorry , it would be very wrong and bad . It would not be Christian , and , Daniel , you must be a little Christian who conducts himself after the example of our Good Lord . When He was called names and the Jews gave Him vinegar and gall to drink , and hit Him and threw stones at Him , He turned the other cheek . And even when the Jews crucified Him , He said that He forgave them . You must be like that , Daniel . " " Yes , Sister , I will . Honest I will . " " Tell Mrs. Lenehan that you are sorry , and that you want her to tell Arthur you 're sorry , and that you will never do it again , " she said . " I do . " " Well , go ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracked face suddenly breaking into a whimsical smile so that she turned aside lest Danny notice it . " I will , Sister , but I forgot it . " Again the nun turned her face aside to smile , but the two fat women glared , and Danny was still afraid of them . " Well , Sister , I am sorry , and I want Artie 's mother to tell him I 'm sorry , and wo n't do it again . " " Daniel , if you do this again you will be punished . I sha n't punish you this time , but I will place you on your own responsibilitynot to do it again . I 'm going to let you prove to me that you can be a sturdy little Christian . This noon , you acted the same way that the Jews did when they crucified our Good Lord . You do n't want to act like that , do you ? " " No , Sister , " Danny said , nodding weakly , only wanting to be let go so that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Daniel , what would your grandmother say if she knew that her grandson was fighting like a tough ? " " I donno . " " Yes , you do . You know that she would n't at all like it . She would punish you , because she wants you to grow up top139be a fine gentleman , not a little rowdy like boys from public schools . " " I guess so . " " Your grandmother is too fine a woman to want you doing such bad things . Now I never want to hear such stories about you again , Daniel . Mind me , now ! Never again ! " she said , and he shook his head negatively . " You may go back to your classroom but do n't forget my warning . " " Yes , Sister , " he mumbled leaving the office hastily , quite relieved . Danny sat very quietly in his seat , the first one in the third row in a classroom with five rows of desks , each one consisting of ten seats . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers while dark-haired Helen Smith read the day 's lesson . Danny followed her unsurely as she pieced out the words about how a good cat caught the bad rat that had been chewing up a little girl 's rag doll , only he could not read all the words yet . All around him were boys , many of them twisting and squirming in their uncomfortableseats . He tried not to twist like that because he was afraid after being in Sister Marguerita 's office , and he wanted to try and be a little Christian like she had said he should be . He must not go fighting again . But he did n't want kids picking on him , calling him a sissy , and he did n't want to fight , and he did n't like school and wished that he was home right now with Mother , or that he was playing with his big brother Bill . He did n't like any of these kids . He only liked Hortense Audrey . When his uncle and aunt tried to tease him , and asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to them yes , he did have a girl , the nicest girl in the first grade , and he was afraid to tell them that because then they might tease him even more . Gee , he wished that he had a seat near her , but she sat in the next row to him and way in the back of the room . He liked to look at her with her short black hair , and he would likep140school if he could just sit here all day and look at her . But he could n't unless he kept turning his head . The boys almost all seemed to like to look at the girls , and now , all around him , they were looking , and there was Albert Throckwaite , two rows away , the boy with white hair and a funny voice . Albert was looking at some of the girls , too . Were these other kids thinking that all these girls had holes that you could pee babies in ? Gee , he wondered . " Children ! " Miss Devlin said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she was saying . Danny stared at her in awe . She was looking around the room , angry , fingering her brown puffs of hair . " If you do n't stop looking all around the room , and gazingat things instead of following the lesson in your readers , I shall have to punish some of you . I 'm going to make every boy I catch turning around sit with a girl , and every girl will be made to sit with a boy if she tries any star-gazing while we continue with this lesson . Now , Helen , go on and read , " she said , and some of the kids laughed , but Danny did n't , and , gee , he figured that he better watch himself . " If you boys want to be punished now , you just go ahead and look around . " Gosh , maybe if he looked around he would be made to sit with Hortense Audrey , and then , well , anybody that wanted to could laugh at him and tease him all they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would just wait a little minute , and then he would look around and be made to sit with her by that woman . There would be nothing in the world as nice as sitting with Hortense Audrey , because he liked her . Maybe , too , he would go walking with her , and they could play together . He wished she did n't live on the other side of Grand Boulevard , because then he could walk home from school with her every day and carry her books . He would like it , too , if he could say that Hortense Audrey was his girl . He would n't care , he would n't , no , he would n't , if they went and laughed at him then . He gazed dreamily around the classroom , and then up atp141Miss Devlin . He could never know what that woman was thinking about , and when she would bawl them out and tell them to pay attention to the lesson . He turned back to his reader , but when he tried too hard to read and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sore , and sometimes it almost looked like he was crying . He glanced around again . Hortense was paying attention to the lesson and right in back of her was that girl he did n't like at all , Margaret Grady . All the kids teased her by calling her Maggie . She was looking all around the room , and she was a goofy , and she was not at all nice or pretty like Hortense Audrey was , and , yes , he liked Hortense Audrey , and he did n't like Maggie Grady and he would n't like to have to sit with her . He wondered now would there be any boy who would want to pee a baby into her hole ? He would n't . From the corner of his eye , he could see that Miss Devlin was not watching him . He wished that Hortense would look up from her book and see him looking at her , and that Miss Devlin would catch him . He would n't care if he was the only boy in the class made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sister Marguerita came in , and Miss Devlin told her , it would be bad , and he did n't at all want t hat , either . Now Adam Morrison was reading . Hortense Audrey was still looking into her reader , because she was the smartest girl in the room . Darn it , why could n't that woman catch him ? Maggie Grady was still looking around . He did n't want her to think he was looking at her , the old thing . He would tell her some day that she was n't a nice girl like Hortense Audrey was a nice girl . He turned back to his reader , disappointed . " I see , Daniel O'Neill , that you did n't believe me , and for ten minutes now I have watched you turning around and looking at Margaret Grady . Perhaps you better sit with her . " He stared at Miss Devlin , shaking his head negatively , feelingall over again as if he was shrinking up inside of himself . " I wo n't do it again , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement and many laughing at him.  | " Daniel , you go down and sit with Margaret for the rest of the afternoon . " " Aw , gee ! " " Daniel , go ahead ! You 've already done enough harm in one day by fighting with Arthur Lenehan . " " Teacher , I 'm afraid he 'll beat me up , " Margaret Grady said , waving her hand in the air . " I 'll tend to that , " Miss Devlin smiled . " Gee ! " Danny exclaimed as other children joined in laughingat him . " Yes , Margaret ? " Miss Devlin said after the girl had waved her hand nervously to attract attention . " Miss Devlin , I was n't looking at Daniel O'Neill , " MargaretGrady said . Descending from her dais , Miss Devlin led Danny to Margaret Grady 's desk . And he did n't even like the way Margaret Grady smelled . She smelled like boiled eggs or something . And the Geat was hardly big enough for the two of them . He had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , and Hortense Audrey in front of him would n't even turn around . " Now , if any other children want the same treatment , you can just do what Daniel O'Neill did , " Miss Devlin said . " Were you looking at me ? " Margaret whispered , spitting in his face as she spoke . " No ! " he answered , wiping his cheek with his hand . " Were , too . I did n't ask you to . " " I was not . " " I want no whispering back there , " Miss Devlin called out . " She 's talking to you , " Margaret whispered . " She is not . " " Is , too . " " Is not . " " Anyone I catch talking will have to stay after school and beat out erasers , " Miss Devlin said.  | " Do n't talk to me , " Margaret Grady said . " I 'm not . " " Do n't ! " " I wo n't . " " Do n't ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he could go home and never have to come back here . But , gee , Uncle Al was coming home . Gee , if he was only a man now . He could do what he wanted to do , and he would n't then sit here and be laughed at , and he would n't go home and be afraid of Uncle Al . He would be a motorman , that 's what he 'd be . He 'd wear a motorman 's cap and have buttons on his coat , and he 'd stand in front of the car , turning the switches on and off and ding-ding-dingingthe bell to make horses and wagons get off the track . " Why did you look at me ? I do n't want to sit with you , " Margaret Grady said . " Miss Devlin made me , " Danny said . " Go sit with Miss Devlin . " Danny caught Adam Morrison and Hilda Wilson crossing their fingers T-wise in shame at him . If he only had wings and could fly right out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky and never come back . He felt worse than he did when he was called a sissy . He was always being laughed at by them . And here he was , so near to Hortense Audrey that he could smell her , and she would n't even turn her head to look at him . Gee , why did this have to happen to him and not to other kids ? And , gee whiz , he wished , yes , he wished very awful much , that he could fly away , or run away , and never come back to school , and here he was with this old Maggie Grady who could n't even sit still in her seat . " You can look in my book with me , " she said . He would n't answer her , he would n't . He wanted the bell to ring so he could run right home to Mother and ask her ever never to let him come back her " Oh , all right , smarty . You do n't have to look in my book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would n't ! Oh , God , please make the bell ring quick , please make the bell ring !  | MA , I promised Dan that I 'd be up today , " Bill said . " William , you get up to Mother 's all the time and I never get out . I want you to stay here and watch the house while I run down to the Italian church to pay a visit to the Blessed Sacrament . " Lizz noticed the sulky expression on Bill 's face . She went to her bedroom , and dug into the shapeless , overladen black pocketbook that lay amid the litter on the top of the bureau . " Jesus Christ , you little pisspot ! " she yelled , almost falling over Robert who was crawling around the dining-room floor , making choo-choo sounds . " Margaret , why do n't you watch Robert here ? " Bill yelled , receiving no answer from Little Margaret who was out in the kitchen , playing house and talking to two rag dolls which she pretended were her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , handing him a nickel . " Now you watch the house . I 'll be back in a jiffy . " " Ma , I guess maybe I do n't want to go up to Mother 's anyway , " Bill said , pocketing the coin . " Uncle Al is coming home , and sometimes when he comes in off the road he 's as cranky as the deuce . " " I 'm your mother . He has nothing to say over you . Butyou mark my words , William ! Do n't trust the O'Flahertys ! Do n't do a thing for them , unless they put something in therefirst , " Lizz said , holding out her left palm and pointing herright index finger into it in added emphasis of her meaning . " Ma , Mother said that Aunt Margaret has been seeing Mrs.p146Morton . Mother said that Mrs. Morton is a high-lifer , " Bill said . " Oh , my poor mother and my poor son Daniel . What they must put up with living under the same roof with that aunt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I , we do n't like Mrs. Morton . " " Do n't you dare even mention her name in my house ! And if she is ever at Mother 's when you 're there , do n't you go running to the store for cigarettes for her . If you do , I 'll lambast you . Your father works too hard for you to be wearingout your shoe leather running errands for a hussy who never even thinks of the word of God . " " Ma , it 'll be getting dark soon . You better be hurrying , maybe , if you want to pay a visit to church . " " Yes , Son . You watch things , and I 'll only be gone a jiffy , " Lizz said , going into her room and putting on a stained black dress . Bill sat at the dining-room table , arranging pictures of major-league ballplayers which came as premiums with packages of cigarettes . As soon as his mother slammed the door and left , he went to her room and looked to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't find it . He quickly looked under covers and in drawers to see if he could spot any hidden money . Failing , he returned to his baseball pictures . Robert crawled about , gurgling . Dennis marched back and forth from the dining room to the parlor , making ding-dong sounds and playing that he was a street car . Little Margaret was still out in the kitchen , playing house , talking to her rag dolls . A train from the Rock Island tracks was heard chugging by behind the Morgan and Hearst plant . Wearing a shabby brown man 's coat , high shoes with knotted laces , and an unclean rag tied under her chin , Lizz walked westward along Twenty-fifth Street just as the sun was beginning to fade . A new Mitchell passed her , sputtering ,  |p147traveling  on eastward under the viaduct behind her . She was afraid of automobiles . But Al ought to buy one for Mother . Her Jim could learn to run it easy . Could n't he drive a team of horses ? Al could hire Jim as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying at the express company and having to do hard work when he was ruptured . Would n't she lord it over the Germans and the shanty Irish around here when Al bought Mother an automobile ? And , yes , over the O'Reilleys and all of Jim 's relatives , too . Al was a good boy , and he would get an automobile for Mother , and then Jim would n't have to do such hard work . A drunken Slav staggered by her , mumbling to himself . She was proud as a peacock that her Jim had taken the pledge and kept it . Her Jim was a fine man , he was . At the corner of Twenty-fifth and Wentworth three men leaned against the side wall of the saloon . Loafers , out-of-works , she sneered to herself . Not like Jim or her brothers . Her brothers were as swell and as well off as Joe O'Reilley . And some day Jim would be , too . And when her boys grew up , they would be rich and have automobiles , and buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the O'Reilleys spit with jealousy . She scuttled across Wentworth Avenue . Continuing , she slackened her pace , because her feet were starting to ache and her neuralgia bothered her . She thought that she loved her Jim , all right . Only if they did n't have so many kids ! That worry each month , asking herself would her woman 's curse come again . Tonight Jim would be like a bull , because she had just gotten over it . Ah , the sad life of a mother with a large family and a poor man for a husband . If she had only entered the convent . God had called her to it , and she had denied God for the flesh . Ah , Jesus , Mary , and Joseph , why had she scorned the call to be a nun ? That was why she was so poor . It was the cross she must carry for not answering her call . But her own people , why did n't they help her more when she was so poor ? Ned could do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who owned a millinery store . And herep148was Al , going to buy an automobile . If Al bought an automobile , he certainly could give her and her little ones something . Blood was n't thicker than water when it was O'Flahertyblood . She walked along a street of dull red-brick buildings and shabby frame houses , and she went into a quiet brownstonedCatholic church . A few old men and shabbily dressed women were scattered about the pews and before the altars , praying . She liked it here where it was so quiet . She could be with God , her true Father Who would always watch over her and protect her . She knelt in a rear pew , bowed her head humbly , prayed to God for herself and her family and her relatives . She arose , genuflected histrionically , moved slowly to the front of the church , dragging her feet as she walked . She dropped seven pennies into the slot before the altar of the Blessed Virgin and lit seven candles in the rack , thinking that since she was poor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one cent for each candle . She bowed her head before the cold , blue-robed statue of Mary and prayed . She moved back from the altar railing and prostrated herself in adoration , hoping that her piety would be observed . Arising , with her clothes gray from collected dust , she knelt in the first pew and gazed devoutly and obliviously , and then vacantly , at the perpetually burning red altar light . She said the Rosary . With closed eyes , she lowered her head . Oh , God , oh , pure and holy Virgin Mary , Tower of Ivory , Comfortress of the Afflicted , Mary , Mother of all Mothers , she , Lizz O'Neill , she wanted guidance , she wanted Mary 's intercession at the Throne of the Great and Powerful AlmightyGod . She did not want to be so poor , unless it was the will of God . She wanted it , God willing , that her man would have a better job . She wanted health for herself , and all of hers . Oh , Mary ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to be so alone with God , with Mary , with all of the angels and saints , with her father , her sister , Louise , all her own dead children.  |p149Here  was where she belonged , she who had ignored the call to take the veil , she who should be bound to God by oaths of poverty , chastity , obedience . Hail , Mary , full of grace . . . . Outside , there was a muffled rumble of a passing wagon . The Lord is with Thee . . . . At home was the dirty house full of kids . Her man was out working hard , maybe straining himself , with his rupture . And here it was so peaceful , so like Heaven must be . She was alone with her soul and her God . She flung herself mercifully into His arms and His care . He would give everything to her and hers , He would . Her eyes became transfixed upon the blushed marble cheeks of the statue of Mary , on the chiseled , darkish Italian face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God to be the Mother of His Son . Mary , whom God had taken as a Virgin Mother . Lizz 's mind dwelled on the life of Mary . The ArchangelGabriel had gone to her with trumpets and told her that she was anointed of the Lord and chosen to carry the Precious Holy Burden in her womb . Good Saint Joseph had taken Mary to Bethlehem , and Mary 's time had come in a little stable , warmed only by the breath and bodies of the little lambs . Mary had lain with the pains coming , and Jesus had been born of woman . Ah , how pretty a thing Mary was . Lizz 's eyes were still glued in fascination on the Italian features of the statue , the large red lips , the eyes , the lovely reddish blush of the cheeks . And she thought that Mary had raised little Jesus , just as she , Lizz , was now raising hers . God had chosen Mary to he the Mother of Jesus ! God had chosen her , Lizz O'Neill , to he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half hour . She blessed herself , genuflected , dragged her feet down the aisle , blessed herselfwetly with holy water , genuflected a second time , went out into the gathering dusk . She walked home , not seeing the buildings , vehicles , people about her . Turning the corner of Twenty-fifth and La Salle , she realized suddenly , painfully , that she was going back home to stinking diapers.  |p150Jim  sighed , expressing a sense of relief . He walked toward the corner of Twenty-fifth and La Salle , seeing the iron picket fence and the unstirring trees of Harding Square ahead of him . There was a thin , faint moon , and an overhanging haze falling from the sky . Hell , a glass of beer was n't breaking his pledge . And he wanted a glass tonight . And of course a man loved his family and wanted to be with them , but once in a while , too , he liked to spend a little time with some of the boys in a saloon , not getting drunk , just having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he heard a train behind him . He stepped along , the street seeming deserted , almost shedding a spirit of lonesomeness . It was just the time of the night and just the period of the year when he got this kind of a lonesome feeling walking down a street by himself . He pushed through the swinging doors of the saloon at Twenty-fifth and Wentworth , waving as some of the fellows lined along the bar nodded to him . He stood at the end of the row of fellows , his foot on the rail . " How 's tricks , Jim ? " asked a mild-faced , gray-haired fellowwith pronounced Irish features . " The world goes on , " Jim said with a shrug of his shoulders , and then he turned to the plump , sandy-haired bartender . " A beer , Pat . " A thin , peaked-faced fellow came in with a can and set it down on the bar . " Here you are , Jim , as good a swig of beer as you 'll get this side of Hell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim . " Fill the bucket , Pat , " the peaked-faced fellow said , nervouslyshifting his weight from foot to foot . " How 's business , Mr. Underhill ? " asked a hefty , leatheryskinnedchap as the bartender filled the can . " It 's just business . "  | " Stay and have one with us , Mr. Underhill ? " the leatheryskinnedfellow asked . " I ca n't tonight , Henehan , but thanks , " Underhill said , laying down the price of his beer , taking the full can and leaving . " Am I imagining things , or is that lad off his nut ? " asked Jim . " He 's a nice fellow , but he falls on the batty side of the ledger , " Pat said . " I ca n't dope him out . I guess he just is n't a sociable guy , " Henehan said . " Not like you , huh ? Imagine Larry Henehan turning down a drink anybody offered to buy him , " the kindly-faced Irishmansaid . " Not on your old lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got your number , huh , Henehan ? " laughed Jim . " A hell of a lot they can talk . None of these guys around here ever broke their arms buying me drinks , " Larry said . " It 's because we 're your friends , " a thin gangling fellow said . " Sure you 're my friend , Schmaltz . You always break your arm digging down in your jeans to buy me drinks because you 're my friend , " Henehan said , laughing in loud enjoyment of his remarks . " Sure , you 're a friend of mine , but me , poor turkey , I 'm deficient in comprehension . " " Still chewing up dictionaries , are n't you , Larry ? " said Jim . " Say , I know what that Underhill needs . If you ask me he cods a woman , " a stout ruddy fellow said . " Mike , do n't we all now and then ? " said Pat . " He needs one steady with him for twenty-three hours or " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better man than am , " Larry Henehan said while they were nearly all still king with gusty male laughter.  | " How about you , Jim ? " asked Pat . " He 's a better man than I am , Gunga Din . " " Who the hell is Gunga Din , some Turk with a harem ? " asked Mike . " You dumb face , do n't you know ? That 's poetry , " Larry said . " Jesus , Jim , you read poetry ? " " Listen , Jim and I have n't got bone in our heads like you got , you obtuse sonofabitch , " said Henehan . " You know , gettin ' back to what I was thinkin ' about be , fore we all started recitin ' poems , there 's things to be said far a woman , and things to be said against her , " Schmaltz began , . " Well , I 'll be damned if this is n't Wagner . How goes it , you German ? " said Henehan , interrupting Schmaltz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master , " Wagner said glumly . " Lost your job ? " Larry asked , waxing sympathetic . " Yeh , " Wagner said dourly , and then he ordered a whiskey straight . " I tell you , boys , we 're living in an age when there is an unholy confraternity of business and politics , and the poor man has n't got a chance to be anything but a sucker , " Larry orated . " That 's because Teddy Roosevelt stepped out of the White House and gave the job over to a fat man who likes to laugh all the time , " Schmaltz said . " What the hell could he do ? He 's a Republican , " Pat said . " Any workingman who votes for a Republican is a damn fool , " Jim said . " Say , Henehan , you sound like you 're trying to become a Haymarket anarchist , " said Mike . " Sorry to hear about losing your job , Wagner , " Jim said , but Wagner 's only answer was a grimace before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do something about this unholy confraternityof business and politics , " said Larry , looking at Jim . " I 'm a union man and always will be one , " Jim said.  | " I do n't like finks , either , " said Larry . " Goddamn it , a man ought to have a right to a job when he has a wife and kids , " Jim said . " Say , Jim , put that sentiment in a letter , will you , and send it to my ex-foreman , " said Wagner . " Here , Wagner , have one on the house . " " Thanks , Pat , I will . " " Hell , do n't take it so hard . Every man loses his job sooner or later , and gets another one . Maybe it 's for the best , " said Pat . " Goddamn it , fellows , you know I 'm still puzzled about this guy Underhill . I guess maybe he does need a woman , " said Schmaltz as Jim signaled for another beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Larry Henehan asked . " He 's a watchmaker , " said Schmaltz . " And he ai n't married . That 's why he ai n't got gray in his head like this gazook here , " Larry said , pointing to the kindly-faced Irishman . " These gray hairs are the products of the course of nature . Whether you are married or not , my lad , you 'll get them yourself , if you do n't lose all your hair beforehand , " the kindly-faced Irishman philosophized . " Another one , " Wagner said to the bartender . " Getting married and having kids gives you something to look forward to in your old age , " Jim said . " When they grow up , they run and get married just as they should , " Wagner said . " Mine wo n't , " Jim said , his voice intense . " I hope you 're right . You deserve a break from your kids , im , because you 're a hard-working guy , " Larry said . " And sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winkg . " I took the pledge before my last kid was born . That 's why m sticking to beer . I do n't count a couple of glasses of beer , " said , and some of them knowingly laughed at him.  | " How many times is it that you took the pledge ? " asked Mike . " It 's sticking this time , " Jim said . " Have a shot on me , Jim , " said Larry . " No , have one on the house , " Pat said . " No thanks , boys , " Jim said in humorless earnest . " When you break the pledge , Jim , remember these offers and collect on them , " Mike said . " Say now , this lad , Underhill ? " said Schmaltz quizzically . " Do n't get such a brainstorm over him , " said Henehan . " Another , " Wagner said . " Say , boy , you wo n't only be a slave without a master , but you 'll also be a slave without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it make , a few goddamn pennies , when I 'm out of work ? If my family does n't starve this week , well , it 'll starve next week , " Wagner said , taking his drink , gulping . " Do n't take it so hard , fellow . When life seems the darkest , there 's sometimes a ray of light behind the fog , " said Larry . " Another , " Wagner said in answer to Henehan . " You know , I 'm still wondering about this guy , Under-hill . " " We hung Underdrawers on the line . He 's washed now , " Pat said , and they laughed . " He 's just a little bit cracked up here , and that 's the thing in a nutshell , " said Larry . " Yes , I guess maybe it is a woman that he needs , " said Schmaltz thoughtfully . " When a guy gets a woman , what the hell does he do with her ? " queried Baron , a tall thin young lad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what is called getting experience , " said Mike . " I just got that , fellow . I knocked up a chicken , and , Jesus , she came around to see me acting like she was the city waterworks , saying I ruined her . She wanted me to put the ringP155on her finger . I had to talk myself blue in the puss before I got her to agree to get fixed up with a midwife . " " You keep your sailor out of the rain , or you pay , sonny , " said Larry . Jim looked around the dim saloon . He had a warm feeling for these fellows , good fellows , fellows like himself , poor but decent , who liked a drink now and then , and a little talk in a saloon . Hell , a saloon and talk like this and a few shots or a few swigs of beer , that was almost the only fun a workingmangot . " Say , goddamn it , I 'll be damned if I do n't puzzle this lad Underhill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? " " No , Schmaltz , he 's a Chinese puzzle , " Jim said . " I 'm serious . You know , you come across a fellow you ca n't dope out , and so you try to figure out , now just what the hell is it that makes him tick different from what makes you and me and the rest of us tick . " " Wind him up and take him apart . But do n't ask me , " the kindly-faced Irishman suddenly said . " He 's probably just like all of us , trying to get along , only he 's just not sociable , " said Jim . " Yes , trying to get along , as best we can . Best as we can . Some of us , slaves with a master . Some of us , slaves without a master . You 're a slave . I 'm a slave . All slaves . Another drink , " Wagner said , reeling as he spoke . " Better brace up , Wagner , and go home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job in the mornin ' , " Pat said . " What ? When ? Oh , yes , look for a job tomorrow . That 's right . Look for a job tomorrow . I got it now . Put myself on the block in the slave market , " said Wagner . " Say , this is a free country , only there 's a unholy conraternity . . . " " Hire a hall , Henehan , " said Pat . " Tough , all right , " Jim exclaimed with a slow nod of his ad.  | " Well , maybe it 's so . I mean what was just said about Underhill , and maybe it is n't , " said Schmaltz . " And maybe . . . " said Wagner , reeling more noticeably . " Schmaltz , why do n't you go home and sleep over this Underdrawers ? " said Pat . " Come on , Wagner , brace up . The world might look like sunshine in the morning , " Henehan said . " Yeah , we 'll eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wagner , sneering drunkenly . " Well , Dutch , now , everybody gets a tough jolt now and then . And when it comes , you got to say this is life , and take it , " said Henehan . " Take it on shrinking guts , " said Wagner , staggering out of the saloon , followed by sympathetic eyes . " I know how the poor devil feels . Sooner or later we all get the same thing , " said Jim . " But we get new jobs . Now , when I lost mine with that trucking outfit , well , I felt low . But then I got on the cars , did n't I ? Well , I 'm better off on the street cars than I was then . Well , it 's the same all around , " said Larry . " Tough just the same . " " Rotten . " " Well , boys , I got to be running along , " said Jim . He paid up , and left , waving . He walked back home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting around to having a drink and talking with them , and  --  well , no , a glass of beer was n't breaking his pledge . And Lizz was at home . Ah , he wanted to get back and into bed with Lizz , Lizz who would be so warm . A little chat with the boys , and then your woman , warm beside you in bed , it made you forget a lot of things . But that poor Dutchman , tough luck , all right . Yes , Wagner was right . Most of them were slaves with or without a master . Hell with it ! He could forget it for the night . He had had a nice time with the fellows , and now he could go home to bed with Lizz . P157s the train pulled into the Englewood station , Al wasnervously glad , keyed in anticipation . He told himself that there was nothing in the world like home . All things considered , he had pride in his home . And Peg 's last letter gave him the feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after the trip , with its worry and with the disappointing volume of his sales , it was a wonderful feeling to be coming home . He stepped down off the train , identified his baggage in the heap on the platform , and followed a red-capped Negro who lugged his thick suitcase and his burdensome sample case . Yes , he was glad to be coming home , with Mother and Peg and the Sport . Now , Mother , she was a great character , itty , a wonderful woman even if she could n't read andrite . And she was his mother , his ! What a fine thing it wasknow that he would be able to give her a comfortable homelong as she lived , to give her the things she had never hadher younger days . Peg was a wonderful girl , too , if shemild only settle down and use that fine sense and acumenhich she displayed on occasions when she wanted to . Butshe would now , judging from the bright rays of sunshine that had been spread over that last letter of hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he noticed the people collected about , many of them folks like himself , bound for home . That was something wonderful , just thought of people going home . That big-shouldered fellow his right , maybe he was headed home to see his little ladyhis kids . Maybe Chicago was as good to many of theseP158people as it was to him at this very minute . It was all the home that he knew in the world , and even if it was disturbing now and then , well , after all , he guessed that no home ever ran smoothly all the time . But perhaps his would from now on . It would . He wished that he had a wishing ring and a four-leaf clover , and if he had , he would wish for just that boon from the grace and bounty of God . And , yes , it was something of greater importance than even his sales record . But then , all things considered , he had n't had such a bad trip . " Just a minute , Sport , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porter waited , he stepped into a telephone booth , called his own number , spoke cheerily and briefly , saying that he was coming right on from the station . Stepping out of the phone booth , he saw a woman rushing into a man 's arms , kissing him . Ah , a sight of joy , wonderful to behold . A man and his wife meeting after absence . Often , now , did n't he wish that he had a wife , a tall woman , stately , like a queen , with inward and outward grace , beautiful , refined , dark , handsome , a woman like Marie Menard ! The man and woman meeting here , they seemed so happy in their reunion . Ah , the wonder of love ! If he were coming home to a wife now ! Some salesmen talked of how , after being on the road , they got their wives right into bed . He would n't . That was unrefined , making the bestial part of man the uppermost part of his love . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still wonderful to be coming home . And he did have Mother , Peg , Danny . And sometime , maybe , there would be more . Perhaps ! " Here , Sport ! " Al said , giving the porter a fifteen-cent tip after the Negro had shunted his luggage into a **26;3730;TOOLONG taxi . He guessed , this time , he would afford the luxury of a cab . He was driven along Sixty-third Street , dim , dusty , dismallylit . But he was eager , and he imagined his happy homecoming . The street became warm to him as an exuding reflectionof his own mood and spirits . It was warm with peopleP159whom he saw for the snap of a second or so as they walked along . A boy , running with a bag . A policeman twirling his club . A horse hitched to a lamppost , looking like the very life picture of Old Dobbin himself . A man in overalls , singing . Yes , even so , yes , even if his trip had not been as successfulas he had hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The taxi lurched past White City , curved onto South Park Avenue . Getting along . Danny would be home . He was goingto educate the boy , make him a smarter and more successfulman than Joe O'Reilley , the lawyer . The park . Trees shedding their leaves . God was putting the trees to sleep until He gave the world a wonderful new spring once again . The buildings along South Park . Might be nice to be moving out here . Nice people lived here . Mother 's cousins , the Nolans , owned a nice new building at Fifty-seventh . Tennis courts along the edge of the park . Tennis was n't the game that baseballwas . Fun , too , it was , taking the boy to the games where lie cheered like an old-timer . Garfield Boulevard . More automobileson the streets every year now . The day of the horse was doomed . The duck pond . Fifty-third Street . Father and Louise used to take the boy to the duck pond . He used to say , Pader , take me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was where Jean Menard and his sister Marie lived . Old sights . Good to see them . Good to be home . He remembered how he felt the night he had supper with good old Mort , in Toledo . Fifty-first Street . The cab turning . Almostthere . Calumet Avenue . Al dug into his pockets for the fare . The cab stopped before his house . The driver was dragging out his cases . Another trip over with . Upstairs , the faces of his loved ones . Yes , home was the most wonderful lace in the world . Noisy and gay , Peg and Mrs. O'Flaherty welcomed Al with ugs and kisses . Then Al bent down and brushed a kiss on Danny 's flushing cheeks . " Well ! Well ! Well ! It 's certainly a treaterino , all right , all right , to be home , " Al said joyfully .   " Al , take off your coat and have a cup of tea , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said , hopping around Al energetically . Al went to his room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up , and placed his black derby hat on a closet shelf . Danny watched his grandmother pushing Aunty Margaret out to the kitchen , telling her to fix the tea . He stood alone in the hall , his arms folded , not knowing for sure if he was or if he was n't glad that Uncle Al was home again . He followed his uncle out to the kitchen , sat down opposite him at the table . " Al , did you have a good trip ? " asked the mother . " Oh , it was fair . Fair ! " " Is n't it terrible that hard times should come ? You know , they laid off some of the chambermaids at our hotel , and poor Miss Gluck , the one with the paralyzed mother who used to relieve me , the poor thing was let go , and she spoke to me the other day with tears in her eyes . The poor thing ! " Margaret said , standing over the kitchen stove . " But tell me , Peg , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al asked jollily . " Oh , Al , my nerves have been bothering me . I have to work so hard at the hotel , " she said with oozing self-pity ; Al frowned , then he quickly forced a smile . " You do n't want to let your nerves get you , Peg . You got to say to yourself every day , I ' 11 be happy , and my nerves wo n't get me down , ' " Al said ; he paused to light a cigar . " And , Peg , if you want to take a rest , I think we can manage it . " " I could n't . I 'm a business woman , not a housemaid . " " Peg , I did n't mean that you stay home . I meant go away . " " I went to New York on my vacation last year , and it cost me too much money . I have n't a penny to my name to go away with , and I wo n't be a burden to you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Margaret said . " Peg , if you need a change , I think we can try to manage it . "   " I would n't think of it . But , Al , I do wish that you would write to Ned . It seems to me that he could do something . What 's he ever done for our home ? What 's he ever given us ? A few damn presents at Christmas . And that 's the total of his generosity to us , " Margaret said . " Do n't be saying anything against my Ned . He 's Daniel 's godfather . When my Lizz was sick , having the little girl , it was my Ned who brought my grandson here to stay with me , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " That 's all well and good , Mother . But what has he ever done ? When he was home , he was n't working half of the time . He would lay in bed until all hours of the day . And he even went out in the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay with us . I was never done scratchingthe fleas off me from that damn dog of his , Rex . He 'd lay in bed , and if I went near him to wake him up , there would be that damn dog , and he 'd nearly snap my leg off me , " Margaret said . " Well , Peg , Ned is all right , " Al said , pained at this turn in the conversation . " All right , be damned ! I 'm going to have my say . He runs off and marries a woman older than himself and leaves all the burden of the house on our poor shoulders , " Margaret aid bitterly . " Oh , but Ned 's wife Mildred is a lovely woman , " Mrs. ' Flaherty said . " I do n't say that she is n't . I like Mildred . But I do n't like he way Ned ran off on us the way he did . And then what appened when he came to Father 's funeral ? He takes out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on indow sills , and he comes to me , and he says , Peg , look at all its dust . ' Now was n't that a fine thing to say when our poor at her was lying dead in his casket , and you and I not knowing here we could turn to get money to pay the bills ? Oh , yes , at was a fine how-do-you-do , it was . I tell you , Al , as long I live I 'll never forget those words of his . And no , neitherP162will I forget the way he ran off and married , leaving a sick father on our hands . I wo n't , Al . I hold nothing against Ned , but I ca n't forget these things . " " Peg , you do n't understand Ned . He 's all right , and he 's very good-hearted . He 's doing well now , and I think he 's settled down . Mildred has steadied him . Before , he was hotheaded , and he always knew more than the boss did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something would n't be run his way , he 'd walk out . But he 's settled down and steadied now . Ned 's going to be a good shoe man , " Al said . " Well , I 'd like to see some of the results of it in some cold hard cash that he might send us . " " We 're getting along , are n't we ? " Al asked . " Yes , but he could help us , " she snapped . " I wo n't say a word against my Ned . He 's as fine a son as any mother would ever want . And he loved Pa . When Pa was dying , Pa said to me , Mary , before the Lord takes me , you bring our Ned here . Mary , I 'll never rest easy if I go without a last word to our Ned . ' Them 's the very words that Pa said , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said . " I never knew of a brother before who brought a cur dog into the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at twelve o'clock noon , to ask him to get up and go out and get a job to pay for his own damn keep . " " Well , Peg , I just came home and let 's discuss it later , " Al said , still pained . " Al , I got a letter from my sister , " the mother said . " How is Sister ? " Al asked . " The holy nun , she 's sending clothes to Lizz for Bill from her orphan asylum in Brooklyn , " the mother said . " Good ! " Al said , liking the cosy feeling he got in the kitchen , dwelling upon the wonders of home , hoping that Peg would n't explode again and go spoiling his homecoming . " Al , will you be home long ? " asked the mother . " About a week . "   " I 'll have to cook a lovely supper with a pot roast for you one night , " Peg said . " Anything you cook , Peg , is grapes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Watching his uncle closely , Danny suddenly began to worry . They might tell Uncle Al about something he did , and he might get bawled out . Aunty Margaret told on him more than Mother did . She might tell Uncle Al what he told her Bill had told him about how babies were made . Gee , he wished that Uncle Al had n't come home . He was afraid , all right . " Here 's your tea , Al , " Peg said , setting a cup before him . " Drink it , Al , while it 's hot , " the mother said solicitously . " Can I have some ? " Danny meekly asked . " Of course you can , Brother , " said Aunty Margaret . " He can get it himself . It 's time he was instructed in selfdependence , " Al said curtly . " He 'll learn self-dependence some place else besides fooling around the stove here . You sit there , you little dumpling , and your aunt will give you a cup of tea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone yesterday . The poor thing , she needs so much for herself and her kids , and Jim makes so little . I gave her twenty-five dollars that I could ill afford , " Margaret said . " She wrote me , and I sent her five , " Al said , puzzled . " What does she do with her money ? " " With all those little ones , putting food in their mouths , and clothes on their back , and shoes on their feet , sure , whateveris given to her comes back to him who gives . She is one of God 's own poor , " the mother said . " I told her again and again she has too many kids ! " " Al ! " Margaret warned , and Danny thought he knew why , and it was because they were going to talk about babies except that he was here . " Uncle Al , " he said hastily , trying to think of something to say to get them talking about something else , because ifP164they talked about babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and she might go and tell Uncle Al about it . " Yes , I do n't see why she and Jim do n't stop having kids , goddamn it , when they ca n't afford to raise them , " Al said . " Al , " Margaret repeated , and , catching her brother 's eye , she nodded toward Danny . " The stork , by golly , likes her too well , " Al exclaimed with a self-conscious smile , but Danny had caught the nod , and it made him feel that Bill had told him what was what about babies , and they just did n't want a kid to know because he was a kid . But maybe Aunty Margaret would n't tell after all , just as she had never told Uncle Al about how she had caught him and Little Margaret playing doctor . " Al , have some more tea , " the mother urged . " No , thanks , Mother . This is enough . " " Here , it 'll warm you up , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup before him . He sat stirring it , and Danny thought that , yes , they had no right to get sore about Bill telling him about babies when they talked about it themselves . If Bill was right , why could n't he know ? They were just treating him the way grown-ups always treated a kid . " But , Al , you 're just home , and we ought to let him stay up a little longer in celebration , " Margaret said . " If he wants to be a regular fellow , he better get his proper quota of sleep . He has school tomorrow , has n't he ? " " I 'm going . I did n't say I was n't , did I ? " " Well , come on , then , you better be getting to bed , Sport . " " Does Little Brother want Aunty Margaret to help him get undressed ? " asked Aunty Margaret . " He 's old enough to help himself , are n't you , Sport ? " " Yes . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt that Uncle Al was n't so grouchy after all , and now maybe everything would be all right , if they did n't tell . He got up from hisP165chair and walked out of the kitchen . They all said good night to him . " Good night , everybody , " he yawned . " He 's so sweet . And Al , he 's been such a good boy , such a comfort to us . " " Al ! Al ! He 's the cock of the walk at Crucifixion school . " " Will somebody turn on the light for me , please ? " he called , thinking that if they were talking that way about him , it was going to be all right . " Peg , go turn on the light for my grandson ! " the grandmotherimperiously commanded . " I 'll do it , " Al said , going after Danny , turning on the light in the front bedroom . " Now , Sport , get yourself in bed so you 'll be fresh for school in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read and write , and Aunty ' Margaret is helping teach me , " he said proudly and , also , ingratiatingly . " Fine . If you learn better , and can show me how well you can read and write , I 'll give you a reward of a quarter . " " I 'll try , " Danny said , thinking that if he made Uncle Al leased with what he learned , Uncle Al would n't be too rouchy with him . " And , Sport , when you kneel down to say your prayers toight , say a prayer for your uncle 's business getting better , " Uncle Al said , patting Danny 's light brown curly head . Danny undressed as his uncle went back , and now he hoped , c hoped awful much , that they just would n't go telling Uncle I. He stepped into his pyjamas , and he could hear them ( king away in the kitchen , but he could n't make out all of hit they were saying . And Martha Morton is getting a divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that was good , he guessed , because so far she had n't told him . " Peg , you 're too smart a girl to be seeing a person like her . ca n't do you any good . You ca n't learn a thing from her they 'll get you a nickel . "   " Why , of course not , Al . I have n't the time . I just met her by accident , and talked to her on the street , that 's all , " his aunt was saying . " That one has the Devil in her , " the grandmother said . Danny knelt by his cot , closed his eyes , lowered his head , palmed his hands together . Hail , Mary , full of grace , the Lord is with thee . . . . He was praying to ask God to keep his aunt from telling Uncle Al what he told her that Bill said about making babies . Our Father , Who art in Heaven . .. . He was praying , too , to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Al just asked him to . . . . Our Father , Who art in Heaven , hallowed be Thy name . . . . He was praying to God to bless his Aunty Margaret , and Mother , and Uncle Al , and Uncle Ned who was his godfather . .. . Our Father , Who art in Heaven , hallowed be Thy name , Thy kingdom come . . . . He was praying to God for Mama and Papa and his brothers and sisters and his brand new little sister , Catherine , and for God to never let them get sick , and be good to them . . . . Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven , and give us this day our daily bread . . . . He was praying to God to forgive him for sinning just like Miss Devlinin school had said they all should pray and ask God to forgivethem all for their sins every night when they went to sleep and he wanted God to know he was sorry . . . . Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . forgive us our sins now and at the hour of our death . Amen . He blessed himself , thinking that it was pretty good the way he had learned to say his prayers all by himself like this . He stood up , looked around at the roses on the wallpaper , and still he could hear the murmur of their talk in the kitchen . He got into bed , turned his face away from the light , thought that it was good that Uncle Al was home , because now he would n't be afraid at night , afraid of kidnapers and Blackhands , or of the old Devil coming after him the way Mother said the Devil was always coming after you . Motherp167was laughing at something . He wished they would talk louder so he could hear them . " Peg ! Peg ! Go turn the light out so it does n't shine in my grandson 's little eyes , " he heard his grandmother saying very loudly . Gee , he wanted the light on . He would tell Aunty Margarethe did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was afraid to ask Uncle Al , and he pretended he was asleep . Al came into the room on tiptoe , smiled gently down at his nephew , turned , pulled the chain on the lighting fixture , and Danny felt himself smothered in this awful darkness as he heard Uncle Al 's retreating footsteps . But if anybody came after him , he would run out to Uncle Al in the kitchen . And they were talking . He wished he could hear them . He sat up in bed , trying to listen . But they were talking too low . He yawned . God , please keep Aunty Margaret from telling . He yawned . He lay back . He looked around him at the darkened room . He was glad Uncle Al left the door open . He drowsed . Their voices were just a murmur . If they told , Bill would sock him good , and call him a dirty little snitcher . God , please keep them from telling . Well , if Aunty Margaret snitched , he would go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Mrs. Morton . Still talking . Why did n't they talk louder ? He heard the murmur of voices like receding sounds . His head sunk against the pillow . He fell asleep .   HERE 'S my girl , " Jim said , folding Lizz in his arms , kissing her until her lips were wet with his saliva . Cold to his beery-breathed kisses , she freed herself from him . She petrified him with a hurt and wronged expression , and he faced her like a guilty boy trapped red-handed in disobedience . And why , Jesus , why , he thought to himself , did a woman act this way ? Why that accusing look , as if he had stabbed her in the back ? Here she was , facing him as if she was going to keel over and faint or else start chewing the rag at him . Well , the hell with it all ! There was his side to it . But , gee , now , he wished that Lizz would n't go on acting like this . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread out of the mouths of your little ones to drink it up in a saloon , " she stormed at him . " Gee , Lizz , I only had a few glasses of beer . Christ , have n't I even got the right to spend a few goddamn pennies on my-self ? " " I do n't . " " You give it all to the church . " " Blessed Mother of God , did you hear what he said ? " Lizz shrieked . " Good night , Mama , " Little Margaret called . " And he took the pledge , too . No wonder he broke it , begrudgingthe minister of God the few pennies I scrimp for holy candles and the collection box . The Holy Father in Rome says that you must contribute to the support of your pastor . P169Ah , no wonder he broke his pledge , no wonder , " Lizz said , brandishing her fat arms as she spoke . " There 's nothing wrong in a man having a couple of glasses of beer . You would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " So he took the pledge ! And lie stays in with his family , and he helps his sick overworked wife put his kids to bed . Oh , he is such a good husband , such a fine man ! Shit ! " " Aw , Lizz ! " " And he has the crust to come home , after breaking his pledge , and to stain these pure lips of mine with a kiss of poisonous alcohol . Oh , such a fine man I married ! " " I tell you , Lizz , I only had a few glasses of beer . " " And here I was , alone with this dirty regiment of kids , sick , when I should be in bed and be taken care of . And where is he ? Out drinking in a saloon with dirty bums and loafers . Oh , good Mother of God , why did I ever marry him ? Oh , Blessed Mary , why did n't you save me from him , me that should have been a holy virgin inside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working in the vineyard of Jesus ? Oh , Mother of God ! " Lizz said in a moaning singsong , lifting beseeching hands and a pleading face to the cracked calcimine of the ceiling . She stood hurt and sorrowing before him , until his face shed pain and bewilderment and his long arms hung awkwardlyat his sides . Clumsily , he put his arms around her . She huffed out of his reach , glared at him , her thickish lips compressedin anger . " I give up . I 'm going home to my mother , " she sighed . " Listen , she has her little nip whenever she wants it . Andat sister of yours , I suppose she 's Carrie Nation , " Jim said . " Praise be to God that he should speak scandal against my poor old mother . Him whose mother and father deserted him end left him in an orphan asylum . " " My mother died . That 's why I was put in an orphanage . " " Well , I want you to know that no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they gave me a decent home , and they brought me up to be a lady . Fool that I was , leaving them for a man who comes home drunk . " " But I 'm not drunk , " Jim said , twisting up his face in the effort to convey to her that he was sober . " Good night , Papa ! " Dennis called from the crowded bedroomoff the parlor . " Shut up ! " Jim snarled , angered by the disturbing sound of his son 's voice . " Do n't you dare talk to my children that way ! If they have n't a father who gives two shakes for them , they at least have a mother . They have a mother ! " Lizz said , gesticulating melodramatically . " Oh , please , Lizz . " " That the shame of God might soften your hardened soul ! " " What the hell do you want a man to do ? Why , I could crawl on my knees through broken glass and it would n't please you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to do . " " For Christ 's sake , Lizz , let 's cut out the comedy ! " " Do n't talk to me ! " " Do n't worry , I wo n't ! " She walked out of the room . Jim clenched his fists , started after her , halted , relaxed , sighed . He blew out the parlor lamp , and went into the dining room , dogged by the smell of kerosene . He thought , God , how a man got himself tied up . Hell , it would serve her right if he just walked out on her the way many men did on their wives . If he did n't find himself saddled with the responsibility of her and the kids , what might n't he do ? Hell , here he was , doing the best he could , and . . . Jesus , she would n't even wash her face . As he stared around the dining room , the house seemed to crowd in upon him . The torn papered walls appeared as if charging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smbther the very breath of life within him . He looked at the table , with its dirty oilcloth covering , the papers and rags onP171it , the lamp burning with its funnel-shaped chimney smoked almost black . He wondered , as he was so often wondering these days , when , when would it change ? When would he escape from this kind of life ? When would he and his family be able to live decently ? Here he was , strapped with all these cares . He saw himself as he had once been , young , decked out in stylish peg-top pants , wearing a derby and a stiff collar , faringforth on a Saturday night with his pay in his jeans , as foot-loose as the winds . Ah , those carefree days when he was so unafraid ! And now ! He looked at Lizz , hoping that she would relent . Ignoring him , she stood in a corner muttering prayers half aloud . All he wanted was to go to bed with her now , and then , after it , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling better than he did now . " Aw , Lizz , what the hell , " he said . She frowned , and then continued muttering prayers half aloud . He stood by the table , feeling that his arms were out of place as they dropped by his side . He gulped . " Move over . Do n't take up the whole bed . And be still . I want to sleep , " he heard Bill yelling . " I-I-I-am . I 'll call p-p-papa , " he heard Dennis answering in a stuttering whine . And the kids making so damn much noise that a man could n't hear himself think . He went and looked at the boys ' darkened bedroom . " Shut up and go to sleep ! " he barked ferociously . He sat in the darkened parlor . He heard a wading train whistle , and he thought that trains went to other places , and that if he took one he would n't be here , and then he would n't k sitting in the midst of all this dirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to do to get away from it was to hop on a train that would carry him to another place . But he knew that he 'd never do that . Deserting his family would ! Hake him more unhappy than he 'd be staying to face theusic . He heard Lizz 's slipper dragging on the slivery floor as she went out to the kitchen . From the street , he heard some drunk singing a song in a foreign language , and he thought it was probably a stewed hunky . He asked himself now was that guy , that poor bastard , going home ? Lizz rattling pans and he knew she was doing it on purpose because she was sore at him , And , Jesus Christ , he had n't done anything , had he ? He 'd only gone out for a little while , drunk a few glasses of beer , made himself feel good and forget a few worries for a little while , talked with fellows , all of them decent hard-working men like himself , except for Larry Henehan who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind . He became very lonely , alone in all the world , with no one whom he could even talk to and explain how he felt . And he guessed that there must be , right now in Chicago , right now in all the cities of the country , other poor bastards who must feel like he did when he had handcuffs on him . " Jesus Christ ! " he said , half aloud and in self-disgust . Dragging her feet , Lizz came back into the dining room . " Want a cup of tea , Jim ? " she asked . " No , thanks . I do n't feel like tea , Lizz . " " We got to get up early . We better be going to bed , Jim . " She went back to the kitchen , and he could hear her urinating into a pot . The image of her doing this became fixed in his mind , and it seemed to destroy his wanting her . It made him feel that everything in life was just one goddamn ugly mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her crabby fit . He 'd be able to sleep , and for a few hours the world would all be closed out , away from him . And again , a whistle from the Rock Island tracks , a passing train , gone . Where to ? To go to wherever that train was going ? To start his life all over again from scratch ? She was finished . He went out to the kitchen . " You can use this , Jim , " she said , wiping herself as Jim placed his hand on the kitchen doorknob . " I 'll be right back . "  | " Watch yourself so you do n't fall in the dark , " she said tenderly . He walked down the rickety steps and into the blackened yard . He saw lights through curtained windows of the house at the back end of the yard . He heard a sudden explosion of Negro laughter . He cursed . Even had to have niggers for neighbors . He stood in the center of the yard , near the wooden shack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed and frosty blue sky , and he saw the stars like so many new and undiscovered jewels . He thought of a line from Shakespeare 's play , Julius Caesar , which he had seen a couple of times on the stage . I would rather be a dog , and bay the moon . . . . The moon , silver and frosty , nice up there , and the sky so far away , so clean and clear , so cut off from all the troubles of a man like himself . Looking up , awed , he felt so small and unimportant in the world . He heard more rocking Negro laughter . Even the goddamn niggers could be happy . And he could n't . He even had to use the same goddamn crapper they used , had to go into it and smell nigger shit . Oh , Jesus Christ ! I would rather be a dog , and bay the moon . . . So many times in his life he was being made to feel like he was worse than a dog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He pushed through the crumbling privy door , and the retching stench of human defecation almost smothered him , filling his nose , seeming to cake in his nostrils . He thought of how this was what came out of all men . Ugh ! He quickly performed his natural function , got out for air , went back to the house , wanting only to sleep . He blew out the kitchen lamp , carried the alarm clock intop174the dining room , wound and set it . When it rang in the morning . . . work . Lizz stood in the bedroom , clad in a soiled flannel nightgown . In the dim light , he saw his two little girls , soundly sleeping , one in the bed , the infant in the cradle . He took Lizz in his arms , kissed her , and she accepted his kisses , lifelessly , but without hostility . He began to undress . " I 'm sorry , Jim , " she said as he stood in his long dirt-grayed underwear , the truss he wore for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lizz , old girl , " he said , his voice cracking because of a sudden welling of emotion and of sorrow . He blew out the lamp and climbed into bed beside Lizz , smelling the heavy odor of her sweat , sensing her beside him as a warming presence.  | LUGGING his bulky sample case , Al walked along Calumet Avenue as briskly as he could . There was a snap in the air , but that was because it was still pretty early . It was going to be a balmy early October day . And man should be thankfulto God for lovely days . Yes , man should be grateful to God for very many things . Al was ! Some fellows , like Charlie Granger , the village atheist who ran the Fox Shoe Store in Des Moines , they said that they did n't believe in . God . The lobsters ! The sapheads ! Reminded him of what Thomas Edison said in one of the Sunday papers a few months ago . Edison had said that he was n't a non-believer in God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eternal mind . God was the eternal mind . His left arm and shoulder tired from the dead weight of the black case . The muscles of his back and left shoulder ached . He transferred his burden to his right arm , slowed down his gait , breathed noisily . He thought that it was good for a man to be up early instead of sleeping late , lying around the house , creating lazy habits . Watching people go to work , he could pick out the real ones just like the snap of a finger . If a man slouched along without any pep like that fellow across the street wearing a black derby , you 'd be risking nothing in betting that he was n't a live wire . Different from that fellow in the gray suit and dark coat who was gingery like a go-getter just ahead of him . If he did n't have this heavy case , he would walk that way . Seeing him going downtown in the morning , nobody would mistake him for a slouch . Not on your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you could be pretty certain that he had no zest , no elan vital for work , and that he 'd never get anywhere in life . Like he had read in some newspaper editorial , or somewhere , a fellow said that at the present time we hate quitters more than they were ever hated before because in this age there was less excuse for a quitter than there had ever been . His case was getting to be an increasingly heavy and dead weight , dragging the strength out of him . He was tempted to rest a moment , but he did n't , because he believed that he should n't quit in little things any more than he would quit in the big ones . But elan vital ! That was a corking phrase to spring sometime . It was the idea of Bergson , the new French philosopherhe 'd read about last summer in one of the Sunday papers . Turning onto Fifty-first Street , he shifted the case to the left side , forced himself along , thinking of the feeling of relief he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the elevated platform . He stopped at the newspaper stand by the station and bought a morning newspaper . Puffing , he lugged it on upstairs to get his downtown train . He sighed , waiting for it . The train came along . Ignoring the pressure behind him , he waited for the women to enter before he shoved and was shoved in . He pushed along uncomfortably with his case until he set it down near the center of the car , against the back of a double seat . He sagged . The pain in his shoulders caused a sudden wave of gloom to pass through him . He saw himself as forever dragging big sample cases around from place to place . But that was no way to think . No place for the quitter in this great age , no place at all . He clung to a strap and began reading his paper , noticing that Andrew Aiken Fletcher , owner of the Chicago Questioner and newspapers all over the country , had just made a speech saying that Italy 's present war with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and righteousness . Fletcher was a yellow journalist , but a smart man , too . And maybe he was right . Of course , thep177golden rule and live and let live should apply all over the world , but the Turk , he was against Christianity and he should be driven out of Europe and the Holy Land . The Turk had conquered by the sword , and whoever conquers by the sword shall perish by the sword . " Forty-seventh Street . All aboard ! " He felt the pressure of oncoming people , and he was squeezed and pressed almost into the lap of the old woman seated before him . The train again swayed , and the conductor barked into the car , " Forty-third next ! " And there was more about the Senate investigation of Graham 's election . And here was a speech by Graham , saying that all progressivism was Socialistic . If that was so , something ought to be done to stop the Progressives , but then , Teddy Roosevelt was a good man , and not like most Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taft was . If the Democrats did n't put up a good man , Teddy would be elected . But Teddy was n't a Socialist . He was just against the big fellow . A priest he once talked with , going to Peoria , had told him about Socialism and the way it was against the home and the family and religion . Pope Leo 's encyclical had spoken against Socialism . That was a great treatise of thought . He would have to read it sometime . And not so long ago he had read where Cardinal Gibbons had spoken about some of these things . The great churchman had said that the Constitution had to be preserved because it was the palladium of our liberties . He remembered the speech because the word palladiumwas one he had never heard before , and he 'd looked it up in the dictionary . A good word , too . Swell one to spring on some of these fathead salesmen . Cardinal Gibbons had said that the direct election of senators and the referendum and the recallof judges was an attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churchman , Cardinal Gibbons . But wait a minute ! He wondered would this Graham scandal have happenedif senators were elected direct , like Congressmen were , instead of being chosen by the state legislature ? No , he guessedp178that it was n't the system and the way it was done . It was an abuse of the system and a betrayal of the people by certain state representatives that had caused the scandal . He guessed that a man as great as Cardinal Gibbons must be right on these points , and on the Constitution . Rattling and grunting , the train stopped at the Indiana station . Al heard the conductor calling out that it was the last stop until Twelfth , and change for local trains , Kenwood , the Stockyards . He was glad . This was the last crushing until then . He figured that the elevated company ought to put more trains on during the rush hours and give the public better service . Maybe former Mayor Dunne had been right when he campaigned for municipal ownership . Only some said that that was Socialistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , it did n't seem bad , whether or not it was Socialistic , and certainly the service could n't be any worse . He felt like writing a letter to the elevated company or the newspapers about it . More pressure and squeezing . The slamming sound of the gates . The train moving , making the passengers lurch as it curved onto the express tracks and turned northward , and then the steady speedy , disturbing rocking movement as it went ahead . He thumbed to the editorial page . It was the best part of the paper . He 'd see what it had to say . Here was somethingconstructive , ought to be acted upon by the mayor and the alderman . Maybe he would write a letter to Mother 's cousin , Paddy Slattery , the alderman from a ward back of the yards , and suggest it to Paddy . If he did , Paddy would see that he was a smart fellow . The city was growing and something would have to be done about the traffic problem , because the Loop was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobiles were now safe so that people were buying them and there were more and more automobiles on the streets every year . Yes , steps should be taken to have somethingdone about the traffic problem . And , yes , he liked the editorial page when it was constructive like this . The fellowp179who wrote this editorial , now he had some good Caucasian brain lobes in his head . There should be more of such constructivethought expressed in the newspapers . And the train rushed on . He heard conversation buzzing around him , and there was some loud-mouth lobster behind his back going on with silly , non-constructive talk about hard times . He should n't be doing that , spreading gloom . He should talk about optimistic things . There he was , off again . " Tony , if there was n't so much goddamn graft , and so many crooks , we 'd all be better off . But what the hell , the trusts , the octopus controls everything . " He 'd just like to tell that thickhead a thing or two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a public conveyance with girls and women hearing him . He thumbed on to the sports ' page , and noticed that Harry Haggin Jackson , the football coach over at the University , was gloomy about the chances of the University this season . And another fight manager chasing for white hopes to return Jack Johnson'stitle to the white race . It was a shame , the nigger being world 's champion . And married to a white woman , too . He wanted to know what kind of a white woman was it who would marry a nigger ? She must have no shame , no pride . What a betrayal of her lovely sex ! " Twelfth Street . Congress next ! " He was squeezed , and then he had more room . He winced from the sudden image of a white woman in bed with a nigger , of Jack Johnson 's wife with the fighter . She ought to be ostracized by all decent Caucasians . But he had heard that niggers had a charm over white women . Suppose some nigger should charm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had better sense than that . But suppose ! His genital organs became troubled because of this vision which seemed to stick like glue in his mind . It made him hope that Johnson would get knocked out by a good clean young white fighter , an Irish lad who could fight like Terrible Terry McGovern in his prime . Congress . The train emptied . He dropped into a seat andp180waited , nervously folding his paper . It seemed to be taking unduly long to go a couple of blocks from Congress to Adams . He sat forward on the edge of his seat . The motorman must be a fathead , creeping along this way . People on the train had to get to work . Why have it creep along like a snail ? He lugged his case to the platform as the train was drawing into Adams Street . The conductor called out the stop . " Say , Sport , tell that motorman that it takes a long time to get a couple of blocks from Congress to Adams , " he told the conductor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Say , that 's no way to talk , Sport . Why do n't you be a regular fellow and take good suggestions when they are given eo you ? " " Out in front ! " someone called , and he got out , with the conductor laughing at him . The fatheaded conductor ! He did n't like people who were discourteous and who were not open to constructive suggestion . He dragged his case down the station steps and stood on the east side of Adams Street , waiting while the traffic clattered by , creating a din of horses hooves , wagon wheels , automobiles , while overhead the elevated trains roared . Sunlightslanted weakly in a few streaks through steel rafters of the elevated structure . " And so I told him that I did n't let anyone get fresh with me , even for bracelets , " a young blonde girl in a blue suit and white shirtwaist said to her chum , both of them waiting beside him , and he thought now there was a decent girl , and he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was cheeky or a masher . The traffic halted at the traffic policeman 's whistle . The girls stepped in front of him and hastened across the street , their dresses sweeping the paving . Young girls made him feel a bit old , old enough to be forever removed from the life they lived and from that joyous innocence which he sensed inp181chem . It made him think , too , of Louise . Lord have mercy on her soul ! He walked as rapidly as his burden permitted , and as he entered the lobby of the Potter Hotel a bellboy took his case . He walked to the desk . " Hello , Mr. O'Flaherty ! Glad to see you back , " the plump middle-aged desk clerk said , smiling as he spoke , and Al thought how good it was to be known and greeted this way . " Hello , there , Mr. Du Bois . I 'm glad to be back . How is business in your nonpareil hostelry ? " he cheerily replied . " Oh , Mr. O'Flaherty , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many guests as we generally always have , but some of them are spending a little less , perhaps . Times are a little hard , but everything like that passes . " " That 's just the kind of a hopeful note I like to hear you stressing , Mr. Du Bois . " " Yes , Mr. O'Flaherty , I do n't believe in looking just at the dark side of the clouds . If you want to know what I think , I think that hard times are as much here , " the clerk pointed to his head , " as they are in the pocketbook . " " You adumbrated that right in a nutshell . They are as much psychological as they are anything . " " Well , thank you . I am so glad you agree with me , Mr. O'Flaherty , because you are a smart business man . " " Well , I try to be . I do n't think that there are any laws forcing a man to be dumb , do you ? " " No , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , about your sample room . Good , I can give you the same room you had before , " the clerk said , looking at a list before him . He handed a key to the bellboy , and pushed the register forward for Al to sign it . Following the bellboy to the elevator , Al thought that Du Bois was much smarter than a lot of these wise-aleck hotel clerks . He thought that he 'd go upstairs , get his samples spread out in the room so that buyers could come up and see them , and then he 'd look around town.  | " Believe me when I say that in all my life I never had as sweet a little chicken as that little waitress in Kokomo , " Jack Doyle said , one of a group sitting around a table for lunch in the Grillroom of the Potter Hotel . AI frowned . Of course , it was natural for a man to do it , but still the way fellows like Jack boasted was bad taste . You 'd never find Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack , where have I heard you say that before ? " grinned Syd Cohen , and they laughed . " Syd , this time I think I 'm right . " " The Jew here must be jealous of you , Jack , " said Ken Smith . " Oh , no , the Jew is a master craftsman himself . With a face like his you would n't know how he could do it . But he does . I know it , too , because I seen him working on the girlies , " Jack said . " Al , here , does n't seem to like the talk of you lowbrows , " Ken Smith said , noticing Al frown a second time . " He never thinks of anything but business , " said Syd while the others were still laughing over Ken 's remark . " After my last trip , I say , that 's one thing I do n't want to think of , " Jack Doyle said . " Me , too , with the luck I 'm having this time out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how 's your kid brother , Ned ? " asked Doyle . " He 's doing well . He 's selling for Fisher and Mostil now , " Al said . " They 're a good outfit , " Dud Morgan said . " Both of these O'Flaherty brothers are as good shoe men as you 'll find in the game . You mark my words , some day the two of them will be thriving in their own business , " Doyle said.  | " Well , thanks for the boost , Jack . I 'll give you as much some day , " Al said . " Ned O'Flaherty 's a swell , jolly fellow , and lots of fun , " Dud said . " Both of the O'Flaherty boys got that Irish twinkle in their eyes , " said Jack Doyle . " Doyle , lay off the fight for Irish independence during this lunch , will you ? " laughed Morgan . " If you do n't , why Syd here will have to take up the cudgels for Jerusalem , and where 'll we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidded Ken Smith . " I 'd only fight for shoe orders , or for the dimples on the knees of a sweet yama-yama girl , " laughed Syd . " Syd , that 's not a bad idea , " said Dud , smiling . " You fellows are all cockeyed , with this talk of fighting . You do n't want to count so much on fighting . The smart fellow relies on the touch delicate and the retort adroit , " Al said , proud of his ability to say such things . " Jesus , that 's a hot one , " laughed Jack Doyle . " Al , you 're gettin ' highbrow on us , " said Dud . " That was a good one , was n't it , jack ? Jack , what 's wrong with these fellows is that they have n't schooled themselves in subtlety , like we have , " Al said , laughing with Jack , who nodded agreement . " What 's all that got to do with how you see a dimple on a chicken 's knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on it ? " asked Syd . " No ! No ! No ! No , Syd ! That 's not wise-guy stuff . Taketip , Syd , school yourself in the retort adroit and the approachindirect , " Al said , again splitting them with laughter . " Al , with that hot line , say , you should be a lady-killer. ow did you keep single this long ? " asked Dud . " You fellows better get more adeptly developed comprehensionsin those Caucasian brain lobes of yours if you want to play ball in the same league with Jack and I , " Al said . " They sure do , old man , " said Jack.  | " Yes , and watch out there , Friend O'Flaherty , or they 'll be coming after you in a wagon and taking you away , " said Syd . " Nix , Syd ! Nix on that kike humor ! That 's not the right way . It 's not kidding . It 's insult , and insult is n't kidding . If you want to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't pull kike stuff , " Al said constrainedly . Syd colored . He continued eating . Al nibbled at the re-. mains of his pork chops . No one talked for over a minute . They sat uncomfortably as the waiter began removing their plates and serving them with coffee and dessert . " Say , you know what kind of shoes we 're going to sell a lot of next year ? Rocket shoes , " Jack said , breaking the tense quiet . " Not on your life ! Not on your life ! Tell those hams in your factory , Jack , to come again , and with a different number . " " You 're dead wrong , Friend Dudley . I 've talked with plenty of buyers and retail people . You wait and see if you do n't have to eat your words , " Jack answered . " I got an appointment , and I 'm going to sell any kind of shoes that the traffic will bear , " Syd said , arising , leaving a dime under his cup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , and no hard feelings , " Al said . " Well , sell shoes , and do n't get nearsighted trying to see any dimples , " said Ken Smith , and they laughed . " Good luck , old man , " Al said . " Thanks , and see you all later , " Syd said . " Say , I did n't want to hurt his feelings . But you know , the kike side always comes out , " Al said . " He 's all right . Al , I frankly think you ca n't take too much kidding yourself , " Dud said . " Sure I can . Nobody likes kidding better than I do . But there 's a difference between kidding and getting personal , " Al said . " Anyway , boys , Al was right . Syd is all right , I guess , butp185he is a kike . He has no sense of fair play . He undersells , and he does anything and everything to get a sale . I know , because I watched him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no sense of fair play , " Jack Doyle said . " He ai n't any sweat off my balls , " Dud said . " Pulling kike stuff , you know , Jack , that does n't go , " Al said . " The way I figure it out is that I guess a Jew does n't know any better than to be a Jew , " Jack Doyle said . " What I would like to know is this . What kind of a decent show or amusement is there in town that a man can see ? " asked Ken . " They do n't have shows on Friday afternoons in Chicago for lazy and tired salesmen , " Dud jibed . " How about a chicken ? " said Doyle . " If I only knew one , " said Ken . " Do n't tell me , Ken Smith , that a man of your parts and talents , now . . . " Doyle insinuated . " Say , that reminds me of one I heard in Muncie the other day . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ken said . " Tell it . But I bet I know it already , " Jack said . " Just a minute , Al . Wait till you hear this one , " said Ken as Al arose and dropped a dime under his cup . " Sorry , old man , but I got to go . Got a buyer coming up to see me , " Al said . He walked rapidly away from the table . He knew that when they started on stories , they were good for the whole afternoon . There were too many things for a man to do besidessitting around listening to a bunch of lowbrows tell smutty stories like a gang of truck drivers . That kind of stuff , it did n't cast any credit on the profession of salesmanship , either . " Well ! Well ! Well ! If you are n't getting to look more like a Princess of Graustark every day , " Al said , smiling at the slightly corpulent cashier behind the desk. 186 A WORLD I " Hello , Mr. O'Flahcrty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after your trip . Did you have a good one ? " " Fair ! Not so bad . But let me tell you , Miss Malloy , every time I come in off the road and see you , why those cheeks of yours get to looking like rosier and rosier red apples , " Al said , paying his bill . " Mr. O'Flaherty , you and your brother are such kidders . I have never seen the likes of you two . " " We 're the Counts of O'Flahcrty , " Al said , and she laughed , showing fine teeth . " Yes , I never met the beat of you two boys . " " Well , goodbye and good luck . Take care of those apple cheeks , " Al said , leaving , thinking that you should kid ' em all the time , and they liked it ; kid ' em with a little sauce and spice . In the lobby he paused , wondering what he would really do today . Walking in the crowds along State Street , Al thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . He stared at the dressed-up windows , thinking that from the looks of things you 'd never guess that times were hard . Lots of people out , many of them well-dressed , numbers of them pushing in and out of the store entrances . Look at this window , full of fur coats , minks and sables . Only , Jesus Christ ! This was a window of one of the biggest and swellest department stores in America , handling the finest in goods and material , and look at those wax models with the fur coats draped on them ! Hell , the faces on the models were Jewish . That one with the gray squirrel on it . If it was a real girl , and you met her on the street , you 'd call her Rebecca . That was n't sound business methods , either , using models that looked so Hebrew . Whoeverthe fathead was who had charge of this department , well , he did n't know his p 's and q 's . Not by a damn sight ! He guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windowp187dressing , and they were using their position to further Jewish interests . A window full of shoes , arranged in crowded rising rows against a background of white ledges and steps , the men 's shoes on the left , the boots for milady on the right . Plenty of styles were arrayed , too , high-laced and buttoned women 's shoes , oxfords , calfskins , plain , ornamented , buckled shoes , nice patent leathers , colors , plenty of tans and black , lots of styles . He noticed , too , a whole row of bulldog-toed men 's oxfords with perforations over the surface . He scrutinized the women 's shoes more attentively . Olson , that goddamn pigheadedSwede ! What the hell was he doing ? Not one of his own numbers in the whole window . That thickheaded Scandinavian ! He had stuffing and straw where he should have Caucasian brain lobes . Al swept into the store , bustled along the crowded aisles , took the elevator up to the sixth floor , almost chewing his fingernails as the car rose from floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How do you do , sir ? " said the mushy-faced floorwalker in a blue suit , with a blue-bordered handkerchief in his pocket , bowing stiffly to Al as he spoke . " Where 's Mr. Olson ? " Al curtly asked , casting darting glances about the shoe department , with clerks and salesmen bending down and waiting on customers . " He 's out for the day . Is there anything that I can do for you , sir ? " " No , I wanted to see Olson . " " Wo n't his assistant do ? " " No ! " " His assistant is on the floor , sir . " " Listen , do n't be a fathead ! I told you I did n't care to see his assistant . " " Yes , sir ! Only he usually refers most calls to his assistant , Mr. Wilson . And if you were desirous of seeing some of our latest styles , I can see that you are properly taken care of , sir . "  | " Listen , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself that it was no wonder that this dumbbell was only a floorwalker . " What do you mean . . . sir ? " the floorwalker asked , nettled . " Listen , get this into your nut ! Do n't try to treat people like suckers when they are n't suckers . " " Why , sir , you misinterpret me . I was only trying to be helpful . Our motto here is courtesy to everyone . " " You can be courteous without being peripatetic , " Al said , causing the floorwalker to screw up his brows quizzically . " A man 's time is money . When you talk to me , come to the point . Tell me that Mr. Olson is not in , and do n't try to act like an English lord when you tell it to me ! You do n't know who I might be , and how busy I am , do you ? " The floorwalker opened his mouth to speak , but Al prevented him by rushing on . " All right , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you got to come to the point . Do n't be a kike and try salving me with a kike line of talk ! " " But , sir , I do n't understand you . I was only trying to explain . . . " " All right . I got you . Tell Mr. Olson that Al O'Flaherty was in , and will he please telephone me at the Potter hotel after nine in the morning . " " Yes , Mr. O'Flaherty . " The floorwalker sneered as Al cut back to the elevator . Riding down , Al thought of how that floorwalker was a first-class , A-number-one brand of unadulterated fathead . All that he deserved to be was a floorwalker . He pushed out of the store , thinking that times could n't be so hard when the place was this crowded , doing as much business as it seemed to be doing . By spring times would surely be better and there would be more buying . America was too great and too rich a country to suffer from panics and hard times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would always come back bigger and stronger.  |p189He  again joined the crowd moving along the sidewalk on State Street . He thought that Chicago was a fine city , All right . He was always glad to get back to it . Getting better and more prosperous all the time . Getting big buildings , too . Look at the Masonic Temple . Say , the Flatiron Building in New York was n't worth a nickel as a building compared to the Masonic Temple . But that was put up by the Masons , and they were against the Church . Now , would n't it have been wonderful if the Order of Christopher had put up a building like that ! He noticed the name lettered on the window of a redfrontedshoe store . . . Feinberg and O'Shaughnessy . He looked at the shoes priced in the window . Cheap shoes . Must be a new idea that Nat Feinberg was developing here . But such damn shoes , bum leather , soles like paper , would wear out in a couple of weeks . He started walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway . " Why , hello , Al ! Glad to see you . How are you ? " Albert Dorian , a medium-sized , sandy-haired , full-faced man in his middle thirties said , giving Al a warm hand . " And how are you , Albert ? I did n't know you were with this outfit here , " Al said . " The firm I was selling for up in Milwaukee went bank-rupt . " " That 's too bad . Sorry to hear it . " " I 've been here a month , managing the store , " Albert said as Al glanced quickly about , noticing the salesmen bustling for shoes among the boxes lining both walls , bending down , measuring feet , trying on shoes . He remembered when he had done that at O'Toole and Ginzburg . He remembered how he had dreamed of getting ahead , going on the road . Now he had achieved what he had dreamed of in those days . Would these fellows here make the grade ? " Looks like you 're busy here . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " There 's no comparison . I had my share of tank towns , dumpy hotels , all the inconvenience of the road . Here , this way , I put my feet under my own table every night , and I 'm with the little lady and my kids . And we had a splendid sale last month , with our sales constantly rising . You know , I hear a lot of sour talk about hard times , but I have seen no signs of it here . " " How 's Nat Feinberg ? " " Nat 's in tip-top shape . He 's just bustling with plans for development . I think he 's got a great idea in these stores . You watch , Al , my boy , and before you know it , there 'll be Feinberg and O'Shaughnessy stores all over the city , all over the Middle West , all over the country . It 's a live-wire organizationhere , and it is based on a sound idea , high-class shoes sold at reasonable prices . " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Al said . " They do n't come in this league with any more electricity than Nat has . Al , old man , Nat 's one of the liveliest shoe men in the country , " Albert touched Al 's arm , a friendly and emphasizinggesture , " and he 's proving it every day . " " He has something in his noodle , all right . But here , Albert , have a cigar , " Al said , handing Albert one . " No , thanks , Al , " Albert said . Acting like the lord of all he surveyed , Albert drew Al back to a corner in the rear of the store , Al again taking in the store in hasty , nervous glances , noting the salesmen at work , the cashier taking in money , ringing it up , wrapping shoes in neat packages . He thought , too , that Dorian was acting a little swell-headed about his job . Well , Al O'Flaherty did n't have to feel humble before Dorian . He had his job , his prospects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were n't many men in the shoe game who would place the name of Albert Dorian alongside of that of Al O'Flaherty . Hell , Dorian was n't even playing in the same league with him . " Yes , Al , this is something that looks like a good thing . "  | " Yes , it 's a pretty nifty idea , and Nat and the Commodore of the Irish Navy should cash in on it . " " It was Nat 's idea , and Nat organized it . Commodore O'Shaughnessy put up most of the jack . Also because of his name , a Jew and a mick , it made a good partnership . Like O'Toole and Ginzburg down the street . I wish I had all the money that the good will of their name is worth . Well , Feinbergand O'Shaughnessy are going to make their name the same . Nat has plans . I tell you , old man , that boy has vision . Why , he is already talking about starting up a factory to manufacture our own shoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al said . " And that makes my prospects first rate . I 'm getting in here pretty much on the ground floor . " " Well , good luck , old man . " " Going , Al ? " " Yes . I have to see a fellow down the street . " " Stop in again . And , say , we got to get together for lunch some day . Too bad , too , you sell such tony shoes . We could use them if they had a lower price tag on ' em . " " Nix ! Nix on that . We handle only the best . " " I was only joshing , Al . But wait and let me show you some of our numbers ? " " The next time I stop in . I got to hustle along now . And tell Nat and the Commodore I was asking for them . Say I wish them luck , and that they should forge ahead with the old sockerino , " Al said , waving as he walked out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a store like O'Toole and Ginzburg 's and not sell piker shoes . From those he 'd seen in the window , he could tell the poor quality of their goods . That 's why he had n't waited to look at some of their numbers when Dorian asked him to . No use making hard feelings by telling Albert what he really thought of Feinburg and O'Shaughnessy shoes . And he could lie and say that the paper their shoes were made of was good leather . Doing such a thing went against his grain . But , well , some day when he had ap192nest egg , and felt like retiring from the road , he would have his own store . It would be great to see his name on the window of the classiest shoe store on State Street . Al O'Flaherty High Class ShoesOr maybe he and Ned would run it together . Have a joint that would knock the whole trade dead . Ah , he could see the store , the refined gentlemanly atmosphere , the aroma of the best , the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the window . He could see . O'Flaherty BrothersThe Best Is Not Too Good At O'Flahertys ' Something like that ! " Say , fellow , could n't you help me to get a cup of coffee ? Brother , I 'm just on my uppers , " a shabby and shivering bum asked , holding out a hoary dirty hand . Al brushed on . " Thank you ! " he heard the bum sarcastically barking after him . It was n't the money but the principle of the thing . He could spare the dime , but these fellows wanted money , not for food , but for booze . All they wanted was to soak themselves in it and never work . They could get something to do if they tried , and really wanted it . He walked jerkily on . If he and Ned did have a store it would n't be a cheap one , selling piker shoes like Nat and the Commodore were doing . The best would not be too good at O'Flahertys ' .  | DANNY stood on the southeast corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large half block of dirt-patched and weedless vacant lot which extended all the way to the alley over which the elevated structure towered . Usually when it was like this , still not dark , kids were playing in the prairie , and sometimes they had bonfires . He always wanted to go near when they had fires , but at home they had told him that he could n't . But now there was nobody in the prairie . In summer , kids played ball here , too , big kids , some of them bigger kids than his brother , Bill . When he got bigger , maybe he would play ball here . He would be such a good player that he would always be taken first when sides were picked for a game . And maybe Hortense Audrey would come around sometimes when he was playing , and she would see him hit a lot of home runs . This noon , Aunty Margaret had been saying that soon , in a couple of months before anybody knew it , Christmas would be here . And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good and obedient boy , because if he was , he would get anything he wanted from Santa Claus , but if he was n't Santa Claus would know all about it , just like God knew all about everything bad that a person ever did , and when a boy was bad and not obedient , then Santa Claus did n't give him any good toys at Christmas . That was Santa Claus ' way of punishinga kid who was a bad boy . He was n't going to give Santa Claus a chance to do that to him , because he was n't going to do even one little thing that was bad , from now until Christ/mas . And he was going to hurry up and learn all about reading and writing , so he could write a good letter to Santa Claus , telling Santa Claus all the toys he wanted for Christmas . Danny spat at a crack in the sidewalk . He walked on a few feet , paused before a gray brick three-story apartment building . He walked slowly , pigeon-toed , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play with him . He had run home a little while ago to see if Bill had come , but Bill had n't . He heard the rumbling of an elevated train . He hopped , skipped , and jumped over five sidewalk squares . He stood still and looked wistfully up at the blue autumn sky . He thought , gee , now , it was the sky . What would it be like to walk upside down on the sky , and have everybody down on the earth lookingup to watch him walking upside down on the sky ? But he guessed they could n't see him if he was walking upside down on the sky , because Miss Devlin in school had told them all that the sky was so many many miles away that everything in the sky looked very small , when it was really very very big , and the sky was way bigger than the earth , and the stars , and the sun , and the moon , they were very very big , too . So if he walked on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would be so far away that he would seem smaller even than a pinhead ? But suppose they could see him walking ? They would look up and they would say , now , who is that , walking up there on the sky upside down ? And they would n't know . That would be so funny it would make him laugh , because he would be fooling them . He would laugh at all the people asking everybody who he was , walking upside down way up there on the sky . It would be a real hot one , all right . He watched a laundry wagon go by , the driver loosely holding the reins and smoking a cigarette . He 'd like to drive a laundry wagon and smoke a cigarette . When he would grow up , maybe he would be a laundry-wagon driver , and he would drive along , holding the reins and smoking a cigarette just like the man in that wagon had done . He sat down on ap195wooden railing in front of a red brick building , stuck a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a laundryman . He took the pencil out of his mouth , and blew as if he were blowing out smoke just like Bill and Aunty Margaret did when they smoked cigarettes . He pulled like he was driving a horse , and his horse went now , cloppety clop , cloppety clop , and he was driving his laundry wagon . " Whoa ! " he yelled loudly , and a lady wearing a long blue coat stopped to smile at him . " Hello , little boy . What is your name ? " she said in a very nice voice . " My name is Danny O'Neill . I 'm a laundryman , " he said proudly . " But , Daniel , when you grow up , you want to be something better than a laundryman , do n't you ? " she asked , still smiling . " I 'm a laundryman . " " Do laundrymen chew their pencils ? " " That ai n't a pencil . It 's a cigarette , " Danny said , pulling the pencil stub out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I got to go in here and get the lady 's laundry . " She watched him with twinkling amusement in her eyes as he ran up the steps , pushed , opened the door to the building entrance hall , and stood inside it . " Hello , Mrs. O'Flaherty , have you any laundry for me today ? " he asked , standing inside the hallway . He imagined that she said that she had , and that she wanted it back quick . And she was telling him that she was giving it to him because she was firing the nigger washwoman who came to do her washing , because the nigger washwoman ate too much of her son 's food . " We ai n't got nigger washwomen in our laundry , Mrs. O'Flaherty , " he said , pretending to pick up a bundle of I a undry . He pretended to carry it out to his wagon and dump it inp196the back . He looked around , and saw that the nice lady in the long blue coat was gone . He sat again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , going along cloppety cloppetyclop , and puffing on his pencil stub as if it were a cigarette . He suddenly jumped off the railing and walked on , biting his fingernails . He wanted to grow up and be a man right away and drive a laundry wagon . But when he grew up it would be better to be a baseball player and pitch no-hit games like Ed Walsh and have the fans yell for him . Look at the funny fat man walking across the street ! A fat man was always funny , because he was a fat man . Danny watched the fat man lumber along , and he thought , gee , now look how big the fat man was , and look how little he was . When he was a man , he wanted to be like his Papa , but he did n't want to be a fat man . Now , what was the fat man 's name ? It would n't be Danny O'Neill , because Danny O'Neill was himself . But the fat man would have a name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew them by their name . Everybody who knew him knew him by his name , and his name was Danny O'Neill . And everybody who knew that fat man knew him by his name . He did n't know the fat man , so he did n't know his name . But the fat man had a name , because everybody had a name , and if you did n't have a name you would n't be anybody . It was getting darker now , and soon it would be dark , and then the day would be over , and it would be night instead of day . He would have supper with Mother and Uncle Al , and he hoped Uncle Al would n't be sore about something . He wondered , now , was God like Uncle Al , always flying off the handle . If God was that way , he did n't see how anybody was ever going to get to Heaven and be able to stay there . Gee , he wished Bill had come up . And here was an automobile , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Automobiles made more noises than horse-and-wagons or jewboxes . Horses went cloppety clop , and jewboxes sort of just squeaked , andp197automobiles went put-put-put . Gee , he wished Bill was with him . And he wished he was big enough to be in fourth grade in school , instead of in first . If he was in fourth grade , he would be nearer to being in eighth grade , and when he was a big kid in eighth grade he would be nearer to being a man . Gee , suppose that right now he did n't know where he lived , and he was lost far far away from Mother and home , with it getting dark . He would be afraid . Gee ! What would he do ? He stood still , stiffened in terror . A kidnaper might pick him up and drag him away and he would never again see Mother . That man across the street was a kidnaper who stole little boys like himself . He was lost and he had to be careful . He took a stealthy step forward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night as Mama always said . The man had a black mustache . Danny dug into his pocket , pulled his hand out , pointed his finger as if it were a gun . " Bang ! Bang ! Bang ! " he yelled ; the man looked at him and went on , but he had shot the man , and the man really was dead . Danny walked along . If he was lost somewhere in the dark , and he had his gun , he could shoot kidnapers like he just shot that one with the mustache . He tried to step on sidewalk squares with his right foot . It was getting too dark to be alone on the streets where it was dangerous . And , gee , he had to watch the way he walked . He almost stepped on that last square with his left foot . He could n't do that or something bad would happen to him . He wove a spell around himself by stepping on squares with his right foot , and if he touched one with the wrong foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black mustache , like Desperate Desmond in the funny papers , could take him away . Almost again with his left foot ! He checked his stride , touched the next square with his right sole , walked on , landed correctly again , changed his stride to get the next square . With this spell no kidnaper like Desperate Desmond could touch him and take him away so that he would never see Mother and themp198all any more . His left foot ! Right on the square before he knew what he was doing . The spell was broken . He had to get home right away , before something happened to him . He ran so that he would n't be kidnaped . He fell . He got up , crying , his knee hurting him , his left stocking ripped . Had to hurry , hurry , hurry . He rang the hallway bell , pushed in the inner hall door when the buzzer sounded . Safely inside the inner door , he leaned against the glass breathless . He saw a ; man pass . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had n't gotten in just in the nick of time . He should have not broken his spell by stepping on that crack with his left foot . But he was safe now . He looked at his knee . It was n't cut , and it did n't hurt any more . He brushed his pants where he had fallen , and bounded upstairs . " Where were you ? I was waiting for you , " Bill surlily said , meeting Danny at the door . " I was playing . I did n't know you were coming up today , " Danny replied apologetically , feeling both happy and surprisedat seeing Bill . " I 'm just leaving now . It 's late . " " Gee , ca n't you stay here for supper ? " " Nobody asked me to . You ask Mother if I can . " " Is that my grandson ? " " Yes , Mother , it 's me , " Danny yelled back to the kitchen . " Come here , Son ! " she yelled loudly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ask her while she 's feeling good , " Bill said , nudging Danny . " Come and have a glass of milk , Son . Were you out running in the prairie ? " she asked , smothering him against her apron . " Can Bill have some , too , Mother ? " Danny asked as he and Bill trailed after her to the rear of the house . " Anybody of the name of William will never have ap199day 's bad luck . That was the name of me uncle in the old country . Come on , children ! " she said , and in the kitchen she set graham crackers on a plate and put glasses of milk before them . " Thanks , Mother , " Bill said as she returned to the board by the sink , took up a pot of peeled potatoes , carried them to the stove , lit the gas under them . " Danny ! " Bill said , signaling toward her with an incline of his head . " Mother , ai n't Bill going to stay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can , " Bill said , causing Danny to dart a surprised , shocked glance at him . " Whenever there 's food in my kitchen , my grandson Williamis welcome to it . " " Goody ! " Danny exclaimed , clapping his hands together . " Let 's go in the front , " Bill said , standing up . Danny galloped toward the front of the house , making loud noises , his feet banging heavily . " Aunt Margaret at work ? " Bill asked , plunking down in a chair in the parlor . " Yes . She went to work late today . " " Come here ! " Bill commanded . " What do you want ? " Danny asked , absent-minded . " Come here ! If I did n't want you , I would n't be calling you , " Bill said bullyingly . " Is something the matter ? " Danny asked , approaching Bill . " No , but there will be if you do n't wake up and quit being such a damn fool . Say , how did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know , " Danny said foggily . " Well , if you ever find out , let me know . Listen ! Drop your dumbness down a sewer , and listen . Are you listening ? " " Yes ! Yes . . . I 'm listening . " " Listen ! " Bill said , farting , and Danny looked at Bill with an innocent hurt on his face , and he wished that Bill would n't go doing things like that that were n't at all nice.  | " Come on . You stick in the dining room and give me jiggers if Mother comes . I want to see if I can find a cigarette in Aunt Peg 's room . I need a fag . And if you let me get caught , or snitch on me , see this ! " Bill said , holding a closed fist under Danny 's nose . Danny shook his head up and down , his eyes blank . " You 're not a dummy , are you ? Answer me ! " " Uh huh ! " Danny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumbbell like you in the Harding Square gymnasium . You go and give me jiggers . And do n't forget ! If I get caught , I 'll kill you ! " Bill said , again planting a fist in Danny 's face . " Yes . " " I want to get some cigarettes , " Bill said , going out of the parlor after Danny . Standing in the dining room , Danny worried , because it was not right to steal , or for Bill to smoke , and he did n't want Mother to catch Bill in Aunty Margaret 's room . And if Uncle Al ever found out about it , he 'd hit and kick Bill , and never let Bill come up here any more . He trembled . He could hear Bill in her room . And Mother seemed to be busy in the kitchen . His face became inordinately pale from fear . He tiptoed to his aunt 's bedroom off the hall and saw Bill rummagingthrough a dresser drawer . " She coming ? " Bill said , quickly but quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you find them ? " " Get out of here , you little sleeping Jesus , and watch , or I 'll bust your nose ! " Bill said , shoving Danny back toward the dining room . Danny sat on a chair by the entrance to the hall . He was too nervous to sit still . He tiptoed to the swinging kitchen door . He heard his grandmother singing , moving about . He guessed it was safe for Bill . But he wanted Bill to hurry up . And if he let Bill get caught , Bill would sock him and call him a snitcher . Oh , God , please help Bill to hurry up andp201find the cigarettes . He put his ear to the door . Footsteps sounded behind him . He swung around , frightened . Seeing Bill , he gasped a sigh of relief . " Listen , do n't you ever tell anybody about this . Do you hear me ? " Danny shook his head . " If anybody asks you was I in Aunt Margaret 's room , you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ! " Again Danny shook his head . " If you snitch on me , you wo n't live to snitch on anybody else ! " " I wo n't , Bill . I promise , honest , I wo n't ! " Danny said with ringing sincerity . " See that you do n't ! " " Bill , who do you think will be the world 's champions next season ? " Danny asked , gazing at his brother with frank admiration . " I got to go and crap , " Bill said . " Can I come in with you and talk ? " Danny asked . " Sure ! I might even let you hold my head . " " Is that what you took ? " Danny asked , as Bill flashed a box of Melachrinoes in the bathroom with the door locked . " I found them in a drawer . But do n't forget ! If you snitch , I 'll kill you ! " " Honest , I wo n't , Bill . " Smoking , Bill let down his pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the bathtub . He heard the noise from the movement of Bill 's bowels , and quickly the bathroom was filled with a bad odor . He wanted to get out because of the smell , but also he wanted to stay and talk with Bill . " Bill , do you think the Sox will win the pennant nextyear ? " he asked as Bill sighed loudly and a splash was heard . " Ah , I feel better now , " Bill said after another sigh . " Do you think they will , Bill ? " " I like it , crapping in a joint like this instead of in the shithouse we got in the back yard at home . Boy , that place smells ! And when you go there in winter , your ass freezes . Pa do n't like it none , neither . He 's always complaining be/cause the niggers living in back of us use it , too . He asks why he should have to use the same trapper with niggers , when his grandfather fought with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's glad that the North won the Civil War and preserved the Union , but he wishes Lincoln did something with the niggers . " " Do niggers ever get to play in the big leagues ? " " You bet your boots they do n't . If they did , there are plenty of fans like me and Pa who would n't go to the games . But , say , Aunt Peg smokes good cigarettes , " Bill said , inhaling , letting the smoke out through his nose . " Is n't it bad for a kid to smoke ? I heard Aunty Margaret saying to Uncle Al that it was . " " They say lots of things . They say that the storks bring babies , " said Bill , and Danny grew tense with fright for fear that . Aunty Margaret did , or would , tell Uncle Al what he said Bill told him about babies , and that Uncle Al would beat Bill up , and then Bill would sock him and be mad at him . " Are you through , Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day that I get a chance to have a smoke and take a crap in comfort like this . One of the reasons I like to come up here is that I can get a good cigarette and sit down here and take a crap like a king . That 's a swell feeling , too . Crapping in a real bathroom , with a cork tip in your mouth . " " Gee ! " Danny exclaimed because he did n't know what to say , and he was thinking that when Bill went to the toilet , sometimes there was an awful smell in the bathroom . After a pause , he added , " But , Bill , if Mother finds me in here with you on the toilet , she 'll put up a great big holler . She does n't like me to be in here with you when you 're doing number two . And then when Uncle Al gets home for supper , she might tell him , and maybe he 'll get sore at us . " " She has n't found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw away before the last drag . " " Does Pa know you smoke cigarettes ? "  | " He 'd kick my tail all the way up and down La Salle Street if he found out . " " I want to grow up and be big so they ca n't tell me what I got to do and make me wear white stockings . " " They want to make a sissy out of you . And Pa does n't like it at all . He says to Ma , Jesus Christ , putting white stockings on the kid , and when I was his age I did n't have any stockings at all on my long legs ! ' Pa would never make any of us wear white stockings , " Bill said , dropping his butt under him in the toilet bowl . " Well , some day I 'm going to be a man . You see if I do n't . " " It 'll be fun when we 're both men , wo n't it ? " Bill said , starting to wipe himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It 's a long time off . But I 'll be a man before you , " Bill said . " I wish it was n't so long a ways off , " Danny said wistfully . " Say , this is the nuts . Real toilet paper . At home , we always got to use old newspapers . Mama do n't buy toilet paper because she says that if she did , and left it outside in the crapper , the niggers would use it , and she ai n't going to be spending Pa 's hard-earned dough buying toilet paper for niggers . " " I wonder how many games Ed Walsh will win next year , " Danny said . Bill buttoned up his pants and opened the small window to let out the smoke . He pulled the chain , and there was a gurgling rush of water . Danny was glad Bill was finished . Now they could get out of here , and Mother would n't know the difference . She did n't holler about lots of things like Aunty Margaret and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said it was a sin for him to stay in here with Bill like this . " Say , Bill , let 's play the battle of Bunker Hill , " Danny said , as they left the bathroom . " I 'm not a baby any more , " Bill said , leading the way to the parlor.  | " It 's Uncle Al , " Danny said as a key turned in the front door , and they stopped talking to wait nervously . " Hello , Uncle Al ! " they chorused . " Hello , Sport ! " Uncle Al said genially , but stepping into the parlor he saw Bill , and his mood changed , his face became pale and he glared at his oldest nephew . " Mother is getting supper in the kitchen , " Danny quickly said to be saying something when he sensed that Uncle Al had it in for Bill again . " Does n't your mother need you to help her at home ? " Uncle Al asked . " She sent me up to see Danny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're going to get home for supper ? " " I was all ready to go and Mother told me I should n't , I should stay here for supper , " Bill innocently said while Danny twitched on the edge of the piano stool . " Yes , Mother said she wanted Bill to stay with us , " Danny timidly said . " You better go . I think your mother might need you . " " All right , " Bill said , getting up from a rocking chair . " And do n't get surly with me , either ! " " I was n't , " Bill said . " Do n't talk back to me ! And sit down . I got something to tell you . It 's good you are here . I want to talk to you ! " Uncle Al said , his face lighting up sadistically with the recollection of the bone he had to pick with Bill . " I better go or I 'll be late at home for supper . " " I got something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Al said , and Bill , pale , almost trembling , fell into a rocker as Uncle Al turned to Danny who quivered on the piano stool . " You go out and tell your grandmother I said you , should help her ! " " She said she did n't want me. "  | " Get out of here ! Do what you 're told to do ! " Uncle Al said , and Danny left , his hands shaking . " Now you , your Aunt Margaret told me that you . . . " " Mother , Uncle Al said I should help you get supper ready , " Danny said to his grandmother who was setting knives and forks around the dining-room table . " Sure , the Lord love you , you 'd only be in the way . Go play with William , " she said , and he followed her into the kitchen , hearing Uncle Al 's angry voice , but not making out what was being said . " Are you sure I ca n't help you , Mother ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standing in the hallway , his knees quaking , struggling to keep from crying , Danny heard Uncle Al going after Bill . " You sit there and have the nerve to deny that ! You dare to say that you did n't tell those things to your brother ! You call your aunt a liar ! " " I did n't , " Danny heard Bill answer , almost in tears , and he knew now that he was the cause of it all , and he was only a dirty old snitcher , and because he was , Uncle Al would beat Bill up . " Why , you dirty little liar ! If you say that again , I 'll punch some truth into you ! By God , I will ! " " I did n't . Danny must have made it all up . " " Danny ! " Uncle Al shouted , and as Danny was trying to reply that he was coming , Uncle Al rushed out , grabbed him in the hall , dragged him roughly into the parlor . " Sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was away , did your brother tell you anything about children on La Salle Street in a barn ? " " What things ? " Danny sobbed . " Answer me ! Did he ? " " I do n't remember . " " Think a minute ! And damn you , do n't lie to me ! " " I did n't ! " Bill said , trying to catch Danny 's eye and signalto him.  | " You shut up ! You 're to be seen and not heard around here ! " Uncle Al flared at Bill , and then he turned again to look piercingly at Danny . " You remember the things that you told your aunt that he told you ? " As Danny slowly shook his head negatively , Uncle Al leaped forward , towered menacingly over him . " You do remember ! Look me in the eye and answer me ! . . . Jesus Christ , stop crying ! " Bill slunk toward the hall . " I 'm not crying ! " Danny said , tears rolling down his red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I . . . " Danny could n't talk ; he convulsed in sobs . " I 'm not going to hurt you . Stop crying like a baby ! " Uncle Al said , breathing asthmatically . " William , where are you going ? " Mrs. O'Flaherty called from the hallway . Uncle Al heard the front door slam . His face went white , and he stood in momentary surprise . " What 's the matter ? Did you send William to the store ? " the grandmother asked , coming to the parlor . " Why , that dirty little lying dog ! " Uncle Al shouted , running to the door , opening it , calling down the hall . " Come back here , you ! " He heard the downstairs inner door slamming shut . He stood with clenched fists , shaking with anger . He closed the door , and returned to the parlor to see his mother bending over Danny . " Al , did you scare the baby ? Did you hit him ? " " Nobody touched him , Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet , and look at him crying . " " He would n't tell the truth . And that brother of his , he never is to be allowed inside of this door again . Tell his mother to keep him home . Jesus Christ , just wait till I get my hands on him , the degenerate little lying cur ! " " Al ! Al ! What did the children do ? "  | " They would n't tell me the truth . And for punishment , he does n't have any supper . " " But the poor little one . . . " " He goes to bed this minute , without supper ! " " He 's so weak . He 's got to have a bite in his little stomach . " " You hear me , you ! Get to bed ! " Uncle Al said as Danny sat with a sunken head , tears rolling off his face . " I did n't do a thing , " he wailed . " I 'll teach you to tell the truth ! Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dragging him to his cot , ignoring his mother who followed them , protesting and confused . " Now , shut up ! Quit crying and go to bed ! Then the next time you 'll know enough to tell the truth ! " Al ordered his mother out of the room and closed the door on Danny , who lay screaming on his cot . Bill heard Uncle Al calling him back as he ran down the first landing . He bolted through the inner hall door , plunged down the few tiled steps in the outer hallway , opened the outer door , jumped down the stone steps in front of the building , tore down to the corner at Fiftieth , rounded it , and hit on toward Grand Boulevard . He stopped by the alley betweenGrand Boulevard and Calumet , his side stitching on him . He watched , but he did n't see Uncle Al shagging him . There was a man coming along , walking very fast , but he was much bigger than Uncle Al . He lit a cigarette . Regaining his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snitching brother was . If Danny told about what he did today ! Jesus God ! Well , the next time he saw Danny he 'd pound every ounce of snitching out of the dumb little punk . He liked Danny , liked to be with him and go to ball games with him . But if Danny was going to snitch , and be so dumb ! Oh , he could n't wait until he got his hands on the goddamn little fool . He gritted his teeth , clenched and raised his fists in frustrationp208because he did n't have Danny before him so that he could sock the talking little mutt . The man came closer , and Bill could see that he had a rough hard face . He was afraid of the man , and something inside of himself told him to run . But he had n't done anything , and this man was n't Uncle Al , Pa , or a truant officer . The man was closer . He was afraid . Why had n't he run ? He made a start . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , firmly clasping Bill 's coat sleeve . " I did n't do nothing , " Bill self-righteously protested , sensingthat the man was a dick and worrying over what might happen if he was searched and the ring was found on him . " Let me go , I done nothin ' ! " " You just ran out of a building around the corner there . What made you run so fast ? Snitch something ? " " No . I just came from my aunt 's house . " " You did ? What 's your aunt 's name ? " " Mrs. Smith , " Bill said , sure that he was in the hands of a dick and wondering what story he could tell if he was frisked and the ring was found on him . " What 's your name ? " " I do n't have to answer you . I did n't do nothing , " Bill said , figuring he would bluff his way out . " See this ! " the man said , bending down , opening his coat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your name ? " " Daniel Jones , " Bill said , wondering about the star , because it was a star , all right , but it was n't like a copper 's star , or like the star Pa 's cousin , Pat Dennison , the dick , wore . " Come clean , you punk , your name is O'Neill . " " What did I do ? " " Answer me ! Your name is O'Neill , is n't it ? I was waiting for you to come from your grandmother 's . " " But I ai n't done nothin ' but smoke a cigarette . You ai n't gon na haul me for that , are you ? " Bill said , shooting away his cigarette with a shaking hand.  | " You answer my questions , and I 'll decide what to do with you . " Yes , sir ! " " What 's your aunt 's name ? " " What did I do that you 're holding me like this ? " " For Christ 's sake , answer my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your aunt 's name ? " " Margaret . " " Margaret what ? Jesus , I never thought an Irish punk could be as dumb as you . Come on , snap up , Margaret what ? It is n't Levy , is it ? " " Margaret O'Flaherty . " " Is your aunt at home now ? " " No , sir ! " " Where is she ? " " I think she 's at work . " " And she 's a cashier at the Union Hotel . So you see , lad , I know something . Now do n't try to lie when I ask you something ! " the dick said , and Bill looked at him in awe , wondering how the dick got all this dope , still trying to figure out a good story if the ring was found on him . " Listen , now , your aunt knows a guy named Robinson , does n't she ? " " I do n't know , " Bill said , suddenly relieved , because now he got it all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Margaret about this man , Mr. Robinson , whose name had been in the newspapers in a political scandal . He heard Mama telling Papa how Aunt Margaret had been followed home a couple of times by gumshoes after she was out with Mr. Robinson . " You ai n't tongue-tied , are you ? Did you ever hear your aunt say anything about a guy named Robinson ? " " No , sir ! " " Listen , about a week ago , you called up the Shrifton Hotel and asked the clerk if Mr. Robinson was stayin ' there , " the dick said , and Bill again looked at him in awe , wondering how that had been found out . " You did , did n't you ? " the dickp210added , and Bill got it all now . The wire had been tapped , like he had read about in dime novels , and he was excited . He suddenlysaw himself as a real crook , and a figure in things happeningthe way they did in dime novels , and he was going to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a real dick . " Talk , punk , and come clean ! How about that telephone call ? " " It must have been my brother . " " You ai n't comin ' clean . " " I do n't live with my aunt , and I do n't know everything about her . " " You know she knows a guy named Robinson ! " " No , sir ! " " Now , tell me the truth . Do you know anything about this guy , Robinson ? " the dick asked , pulling out a five-dollar bill , holding it carelessly before Bill 's eyes . " Does she ever say anything about seeing him ? " " I do n't know , " Bill said , watching the five-dollar bill , figuring that he could say something maybe to get the money , and still not give anything away on his aunt , because if he did that it would be snitching . " Ever see anything like this paper I got in my hand ? " the dick asked . " It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick it in your pocket ? " Bill smiled , thinking of the cigarettes , sodas , things that the dough could buy . " Well , if you tell me the truth , you might get it . " " I am telling you the truth . " " Well , tell me , now , what have you ever heard your aunt say about this guy , Robinson ? " " Well , all I know is that she knows him . " " When she gets you to call up the hotel and ask if he 's there , what does she say to you ? " " Just that . She asks me to call up , " Bill answered , guessingp211that this was n't giving Aunt Margaret away , because the dick already knew that much . " Tell me the exact words she uses . " " I do n't know . She just tells me to call up . " " Ever hear anybody else , your mother or grandmother talking about him ? " " PTO  --  " Does she ever say she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I do n't know . " " Did you ever hear her say that he gives her money ? " " No , " Bill said , still freezing his eyes on the five-dollar bill , tempted to tell more so that he would get it , telling himself , like a martyr , that he could n't be a snitcher . " Well , why did she have you call up a hotel to find out if he was there ? " " I guess she wanted to talk to him . " " Is there nothing else she ever says about him ? " " No ! " Bill said , trying to figure out how many nickel shows he could go to with that money . The gum shoe studied him closely . Was he , or was n't he going to get the money ? If the dick gave it to him he 'd be rich . And he 'd sell the ring and have enough money for nickel shows , and cigarettes , and penny arcades downtown for longer than he could imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gumshoe said . Bill watched his face , wondering , should he ask for the money , reach for it , or what ? " Listen close , kid ! If I give you this money , I know what you 'll do . You 'll go right back to your aunt , wo n't you ? " " No , I would n't ! If I did , and took the money , maybe I would n't get my pants whaled hot as cinders ! " Bill said , shaking his head negatively , still eyeing the money . " If I give it to you , will you listen , remember what you hear , and tell me whatever she says about this guy , Robinson ? " " But if I do , maybe I 'll get in trouble . "   " Do n't worry about that . We wo n't let on . Your aunt does n't know who I am , and she wo n't , unless you tell her . And if you do , I 'll ring your goddamn neck off your head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir ! " " All right , here it is . Do n't forget ! You do n't say boo about this . If you do , you wo n't get another chance . I 'll see you again . Remember everything she says . And whenever you come here to see your brother , look and see if she has any letters from him . I 'll give you five bucks for every letter of his to her you get me . Watch the mailbox and see if he sends her any money in the mail , too , and tell me . Will you do that ? " " Yes , sir ! " " All right , now . Here 's the dough . But if you squeal , goddamnyou ! " the gumshoe said , jamming his fist under Bill 's nose . " Yes , sir ! " Bill said , taking the money . He watched the burly fellow walk off . He fingered the money . It was too good to believe . The money was his . He took out the ring he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shiny stone under the lamplight . He 'd sell it , too . But if Danny ever gave him away ! What the dick threatened to do to him was nothing at all , nothing at all , to what he 'd do to Danny ! He lit another cigarette , walked proudly over to Grand Boulevard and down toward Fifty-first Street . He was living a life like they lived in stories , with stolen rings , private detectives , money . He could n't wait until he grew up , because when he did , he was going to be the greatest crook there ever was , greater than Jesse James or Alias Jimmy Valentine . He puffed at his cigarette . He felt the five-dollar bill and the ring in his pocket . He would n't go home now . He 'd buy supperin a Greek restaurant on Fifty-first Street , and he would eat three chunks of apple pie . And tomorrow he 'd bum from school , go downtown , have a swell time . He had done a pretty smart day 's work today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would n't he make the crooks in dime novels look sick ! Just to show himself what he was , he pulled out a cork-tipped cigarette , lit it , took one puff , threw it away like a butt , lit another one . He walked down to Fifty-first Street , whistling a gay tune . And from now on at Mother 's he 'd have to watch the mailbox , because if the gumshoe was right , and Mr. Robinson did send Aunt Margaret dough , well , he might pinch some of it . Lying on his cot in the darkness , Danny 's eyes stung from crying . And he was hungry . Uncle Al was just mean . He never wanted to see Uncle Al again , or speak to him . He would go home with Papa and Mama , and even if they did n't have a bathroom in the house , and steam heat , and electric lights , he would go home , or he would run away . He would run away and not come back until he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back and beat Uncle Al up , good and plenty . Turning around to lie on his belly , he saw the blue sky and the dark night . And if he had n't been a snitcher and told on Bill , this would never have happened , and Bill would be here , talking to him about ballplayers , right this minute . Bill told him that a snitcher was the worse thing a kid could be . And he was a snitcher . He let out a wail . He waited to see if anyone came in after his scream , No one did . He looked out at the night , and it was so dark it made him afraid . It would serve Uncle Al right , too , if some kidnaper or Blackhandcame in the window , took him , killed him in a dark black woods , let a bear eat him up , or gave him to some Indianswho would tomahawk him and kill and cat him the way they did to the soldiers , just like Aunty Margaret had said they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was sore at Aunty Margaret , too , and it was her fault . When he saw her in the morning , he would n't even speak to her . And if she could tell Uncle Al on Bill and him , he could tell Uncle Al that she came home drunk , and cursed , and did n't go top214church on Sunday , and told Mother that she was with that Morton woman that Uncle Al did n't want her to see and said never could come in his house . It was so dark . He curled his head under the covers . He might smother , though , this way . And if he did , it would be their fault . And then it would cost them money for his funeral , because funerals cost money , and Aunty Margaret was always saying how it cost her so much to have a funeral for Father and for Aunty Louise . He wanted Aunty Louise to be here so he could tell her what they did to him . She would stick up for him if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday , he was going to pray and ask God to send Aunty Louise back to him from Heaven where she was . She would n't let them starve him until he was so hungry that he had pains in his tummy . No , she would n't . He heard a noise . It was the door , opening . It was Uncle Al , or a kidnaper ! 000 ! " Whist ! Son ! " He pulled the covers aside and saw his grandmother carrying something in the dark . Suddenly , the light was on and she was beside his bed , holding a tray of food . " Ssh ! Do n't let your uncle hear you ! You poor child . Here , eat this quick ! " she said , putting the tray on his lap , kissing him tenderly.  | BILL told his mother that he had to go out the back way to go to the toilet . He glanced furtively up from the bottom of the rickety steps to see if she was looking after him . He smiled with gratification when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps where he had hid his money and the ring last night , using match light to see . The treasures were undisturbed and he stuck them in his pocket , thinking that he had to have a flashlight . He 'd get one downtown . How could he work without one ? He darted across the small back yard , a patch of hardened dirt strewn with broken glass , tin cans , sticks , and assorted rubbish . He skipped along the passageway to the alley which ran by the side of the tumbledownclapboard house in the back where the Negro family lived . He dumped into a garbage can the lunch his mother had prepared and wrapped for him . Hell , he was rich today and he could buy himself anything that he wanted to eat . With a feeling of freedom and hope , he stepped out onto Twenty-fifth Street . The bare trees of the deserted playground across the street glistened in the morning sunlight . Two foreignersin smeared overalls passed in front of him , carrying lunch boxes and jabbering away in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . They could n't speak English like his father could . A troop of Italian kids , none of them older or bigger than Danny , dragged in front of him , yelling , pushing one another , cursing . He watched them , thinking that they were only dirty dago brats , and he did n't like wop kids . Sometimes they 'd even use a knife on you . Down on Wentworth Avenue street cars rumbled , and thenp216their echo was momentarily smothered by the noise of a swiftly rushing train which clattered behind him on the Rock Island tracks . A teamster bawled at his horses , driving a Morgan and Hearst wagon to La Salle Street , and Bill sneered after the wagon because he knew that that man could n't drive a horse as good as Pa could . He guessed that Pa could drive a horse better than anybody in the city , and when his grandfather was living , his grandfather must have been pretty good , too , driving horses . He started stepping on sidewalk cracks . " Hey , O'Neill ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and saw Big Ears Delaney running toward him , yelling his name as he tore forward . " Jesus , stranger ! Hello ! " Big Ears said , short of wind when he reached Bill ; he was Bill 's size and age , but huskier , oliveskinned , and with ears that suggested his nickname . " How are you , Big Ears ? " " Going to school today to pay Miss Harris a visit ? " " I 'm gon na buy an apple and put it on her desk , " Bill said . " Hell ! We ai n't seen you in school this week . And Mr. Morgan in manual training was asking for you . You got a drag with him like you got one with Miss Timmins in arithmetic , because you 're so good in both things . " " I was sick . " " You was sick two weeks ago . Is it the same thing that 's the matter with you this week ? " " You do n't have to believe me . But I was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell you think I am , teacher 's pet ? I 'm not going up to Miss Timmins and say you been bummin ' from school and I seen yuh , " Big Ears said , drooping along at a slow pace beside Bill . " I got to go downtown on an errand for my old lady so I ca n't come today , " Bill said . " Horse ! Say , listen , I ai n't wishin ' you bad luck , but I want to warn you . I hope you do n't get what I got . I was caught bummin ' from school by Cockeye Colman , the new truant officer . He seen my old man about me . So the old man thrunp217me up for grabs , and beat my ass black and blue . You better watch yourself , boy , because we ai n't never had a sonofobitchin ' truant officer around here as tough as this bastard , Cockeye Colman , is . " " He wo n't get me , " Bill bragged , thinking how he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was going to grow up to be the world 's greatest crook . " That 's what they all say , Skinny ! But he nabbed me . And Miss Harris went to the old hen herself about me . That old hen we got for a principal , she and Cockeye Colman said if I did n't want to go to school , they would put me in a joint where I 'd have to go . And my old man tol ' me that if I did n't want to go to school and get myself smartened up , he did n't give a damn if I was jugged in a reform school . But , say , Skinny , got an extra butt ? " Big Ears said , as they stopped at the corner of Twenty-fifth and Wentworth , in front of the saloon . Big Ears Delaney 's eyes popped in awe when Bill pulled out a box of Melachrinoes and handed him one . Bill took one , and they lit up . " Cork tips ! Say , where 'd you snitch ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his house yesterday . " " He must have dough to smoke fags as classy as these . My old man , he rolls his own . " " My uncle is rich . He travels all around sellin ' shoes , and he 's got lots in his kick , " Bill said , ashamed to say that he 'd stolen the cigarettes from his aunt , rather than his uncle , because he did n't want kids in the neighborhood to know that he had an aunt who smoked . " Boy , I never drew on anything like this before . Say , you got a box of ' em , how about another for me for afterwhile ? " Delaney asked , and Bill magnanimously handed him a second cigarette . " Thanks ! You 're a regular kid , O'Neill . Any time you get in trouble , you call on me . Me and my gang , we 'll stand by you . But , say , you shoulda been around yesterday.  |p218We  went down under the viaduct there after the nigger kids on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em out of house and home ? " " Did we ! Did we ! We had a fight ! The cops had to come to break it up . One of the black stinkers damn near cut the arm off of Tony Scarsella with a razor .

But when you get close to ' em , all you got to do is kick ' em in the shins , and they 'll yell for their pickaninnies . One swipe in the shins with your boots , and you got ' em licked . But we got ' em plenty . You know what we did . We went around to back yards and copped some clothes poles . And Tony snatched some spikes in the Jew 's hardware store on Wentworth . We druve the nails in the poles , and went over after ' em with the poles . They did n't expect that . Hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black bastard 's eye .

We need all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the viaduct , the niggers keep flocking out from all sides , and we need all the guys we can get for ' em . " " I 'll be there .

I 'm gettin ' my last chance . I do n't want the old man poundin ' lumps all over me . He 's swillin ' again now , broke his pledge the old lady made him take , and he always lams me when he 's drunk . And I might get myself shoved in reform school , too , if I get caught bummin ' from school any more . " " Aw , come on , you can get away with it . " " No , not for me . I learned my lesson , Skinny . " " Well , I 'll hop this car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after-noon . " " Say , Skinny , you could n't spare a jit , could you ? I got some bottles saved up that I 'm gon na sell Saturday , and I 'll pay you back then . Cross my heart on it . " " Here , " Bill said , lavishing a nickel on Delaney . " Thanks ! Say , you 're a prince , Skinny ! " " Well , here 's my car , Big Ears , " Bill said , running across the street while Delaney waved after him . Bill waited until the Wentworth Avenue car started up , and then he flipped it . He stood on the jammed smoky back platform , hardly able to wait until he could get downtown . Next to him there was a blond guy talking with a young fellowwho looked like he might be a dago or a hunyock . " I 'm quittin ' . It ai n't safe to drive a newspaper delivery wagon for my paper any more and belong to the union . I 'm shaking the dust off myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my shoulders , " the blond fellow was saying , and Bill did n't get what he was talking about . " We should all stick together and fight , " the other one said . " We do n't stand a chance fighting the hooligans the paper hired , " the bland one said . " We got to fight for our union , " the other was saying , andp220Bill was n't interested in what they said , but he would be if they talked about baseball , or burglars and robbing , or girls . The car rumbled on , more passengers crowding onto the platform , and Bill was pushed away from the two he had heard talking . There was a lot of talk now , but he could n't make out much of it because of the noise the car made in running , and the many voices . He felt the ring and the money in his pocket . It was great to be rich , all right , rich and not at school on a day like this , on any day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd go out to Mother this afternoon and buy Danny a soda . Now , he would n't . All he was going to do to Danny was sock the daylights out of him . The car clattered on , and many of the men on the platform got off . Bill turned and looked through the window , seeing Saint Peter 's church . It was where Marna had gone to school . He wondered about Pa when he was a kid . He 'd bet Pa bummed from school . But he guessed Uncle Al never did . He bet Uncle Al was a teacher'spet in school . " Van Buren Street ! " the conductor called , and Bill hopped off the car , dodged in front of a horse-and-wagon , and landed on the sidewalk . Elevated trains thundered overhead while he stood on the corner of Clark and Van Buren . He asked himself where could he sell the ring . He might try a pawnshop . Only he was kind of leary of trying to hock the ring , because he had on short pants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They might even call the cops on him . He did n't know what to do about the ring . He ran across the street . A restaurant window containing apples and bottles of catsup caught his eye . He liked restaurants , the smell of them , the pies and sandwiches they sold , and when he grew up he was always going to eat in restaurants , and never at home . He went in and sat at the counter , looking at slices of pie , cake and cookies , bottles of catsup , sauces , oranges and apples which were directly in front of him . A fat Greek flat-footed to him and set a glass of water by his right elbow as he leaned on the counter.  | " Apple pie and coffee , " he ordered as if he might have been a man ordering . He carefully watched the counterman slide a cut of pie onto a plate , draw coffee , pour cream into it . The order was pushed across the counter to him , the coffee . slopping over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gobbled up the pie in chunks , and gulped down his coffee , thinking that this was swell , this was the life . But still he was wondering , somewhere in the back of his head , what he was going to do with the ring . He was afraid of being caught , and he told himself that he was n't afraid of being caught , and he was n't afraid of nothing at all . He noticed two men , several seats to his left . They were eating ham and eggs and talking , their voices a little low so that he could n't get their words . Would they buy it off him ? Might he take a chance on them , and say that he found the ring ? He tried to make up his mind , and he let his gaze drift out the window . He saw an express wagon shoot past , the horse galloping . Was it Pa 's by any chance ? Would n't that be good ! Himself to be walking around downtown , and Pa to see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would n't Pa be sore , and would n't he get it on his ass with the razor strap tonight ? He 'd watch the express wagons carefully today . Pa drove his some place downtown , but he did n't know where . Tonight he 'd have to just ask Pa and find out , and then , after this , he would know what streets to keep off of when he was downtown bumming from school . He had n't told Pa and Ma about Uncle Al last night . Well , if they said anything to Pa and Ma , he would say Uncle Al just got sore . Pa would stick up for him . Pa always said that if anybody was going to hit and punish his kids , he would do it himself , but just let anybody else try and lay a hand on a kid of his ! And Pa meant it , Pa was a real fighter , and he was proud of Pa for it . But that ring ? He had to sell it to make some money . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to sit nearer them so he could hear what they were saying . He saw one of themp222bending over , scooping fried egg into his mouth , wiping his chin with a napkin when some of the egg yellow dribbled down it . Now , why did n't he get ham and eggs ? Well , he could . He was rich enough to eat as much ham and eggs as he could get into his belly . " An order of ham and eggs , " he called to the waiter . He thought of how swell it was going to be when he was a man and could eat all that he wanted to in restaurants like this one . And then he would n't be afraid of Uncle Al , or even of Pa . And when he was a man , he was going to be rich like Uncle Al , and not poor like Pa . He was n't going to drive an express wagon and make hardly enough money to take care of his kids . Bill O'Neill would be the smartest crook in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb one at eleven . But suppose that he tried to sell the ring to those two men , and they were dicks . But they were n't . You could always spot a dick , because the dicks seemed to have their own way of looking and talking . He wished they would hurry up with his ham and eggs . He was going to eat them like a man , and pay for them like a man . The men were finished with theirs , but they were still talking , ordering more coffee . He heard the cook calling from the slide in the wall that opened into the kitchen , and he saw the counterman get the plate , come forward with it . He pitched into the ham and eggs as if he had been starving . He ate with his eyes set on the men . He would catch them when they were paying their checks . Seeingthat they were still taking their time , he ate more slowly . He had a hunch it would work , and they 'd buy the ring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would try a hock shop . He was a daredevil , and he would take his chances . He ate , waiting , feeling himself grow tight inside . But no , he told himself , he was n't afraid . He just wanted to get it over with . When they swung off their stools , he felt like shouting hurray . He got off his , and got to the case in front at the same time that they did . " Hey , mister , want to buy this ring ? " he said , speakingp223rapidly to one of the men , a fellow with a hard face and a black derby shoved back on his head . " Where 'd you get it ? I 'll bet you found it , " the man sarcasticallyanswered , talking out of the side of his mouth , and the other one , a pimply thin guy with a felt hat , looked Bill in the eye until Bill had to turn away . " I did . Right outside on the sidewalk , " Bill said , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want it . And better watch the way you find things , Bud , " the man said , causing Bill almost to gulp with disappointment . " Kids like you always find things . Why ai n't you in school ? " the pimply one in the felt hat said . " My mother sent me downtown to the store . " " Here , let 's take a look at it , " the pimply one said , smilingat Bill , causing Bill to return the smile , but still , he was wary , and he edged himself to the right of the men so that if it looked too hot , he could take a chance on snatching at the ring and beating it out the door . " How much you want for it ? " the man with the derby asked . " Five bucks . " " I 'll give you two bucks and pay your check , " the pimply one said , and Bill reached his hand out suspiciously , while he anxiously and enviously , watched the fellow peel off two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't worth that much , " the one with the derby said . " I know it , but we 'll give the kid a break , " the pimply one said , handing Bill two dollars and taking his check . Bill hurried out of the restaurant , watched by the two smiling men and the frowning Greek . Crossing Van Buren Street , he congratulated himself on his luck . He had over six bucks now and the whole day in which to spend it . He looked behind him . They might follow him . No , he could n't see them . He ran down Clark Street anyway , just not to take any chances.  |p224Bill  felt unsteady for a moment after he came out of the show on South State Street . He felt funny . The man next to him grabbing at his pants that way . He knew that kids at school tried to stick their hands up under a girl 's dress , and he tried it on Polack Mary once , and she had nearly scratched him for doing it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress , and the other kids said that she and Big Ears had taken off all their clothes together in the cellar of an empty house at Twenty-fourth Street . But he could n't see why a man should try and do that to a kid . It had sent shivers running up and down his back . He stood at the curb edge , watching the traffic pass . He turned away from the curb . If he stood there , it would be just his luck for Pa to drive past . He stuck his hands in his pockets and ambled slowly along . He thought of the women he had seen in the show without a lot of clothes on . He had seen their legs , and he could tell that their boobies were bouncing when they danced . He wanted to see all the women in all the world without a stitch on , just as he was sometimes lucky enough to see Aunt Margaretat Mother 's . He wanted to see their tits , and the hair under the bellies , and their belly buttons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big , and she fed the baby with them , and he was not interested in seeing them the way he was in seeing Aunt Margaret 's . And when Mama gave Little Margaret a bath in the washtub out in the kitchen , he saw Little Margaret , but she was too little to have anything to see . Gee , too , did n't he wish that he was able to ! He had tried to find out if he was , and his arms had just gotten tired , and nothing had happened , the way some of the kids said something happened when you tried that stunt . But he would be able to . He was getting a little bit of hair now . And there were places called whorehouses where men went and paid money , and women let them , and the men saw and did everything . If he wasp225only able and could find a place like that to go to today when he had money . Another express wagon . He guessed he better hug the inside of the sidewalk . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off Aunt Margaret or Mother and go to one of those places they called whorehouses and find out . He looked at a woman coming toward him . Her titties did not shake as much as those of the girls who danced in the show . But on the street women wore corsets . Aunt Margaret had corsets , and sometimes she had her corset on , but no dress , only that , and stockings , and he could see her legs . Mama did n't wear corsets . He noticed a penny arcade , and stepped in , because he could see slides and moving pictures of girls taking their clothes off , and diving , and swimming . He stopped at the counter in front and bought hot dogs and root beer . He got a bellyache , and went back to change a dollar and look at everything he could see . He noticed the shooting gallery in the back . He walked to it first . Since he was going to be the greatest crook that ever lived , he had to know how to shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to own it , thought that it was the most beautiful thing in the world , and thought that he wanted a gun like this one more than he wanted anything else in the world . He wondered , could he get away with stealing the silver twenty-two that Uncle Al kept in his closet ? It was getting on toward four o'clock and there was a slightly chilly wind when Bill came out of the store , carrying the flashlight . And since he had n't been able to cop it , well , it was worth the buck he had spent for it . Now if he only had a pearl-handled pistol , then his tools would be nearly complete , unless he wanted to go in for safe-cracking . He touched the flashlight as if it were a delicate object . He looked at its black frame . He lit it , but it would n't show any lightp226until it was lit in the dark . He unscrewed the top , and the small bulb , looked at them , put them back in place . He opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then put them back . He could n't wait until it was dark , so he could play with it and the light would be bright . But when Pa and Ma asked him how he got it , what story could he tell them ? Better not say he found it . Not with Pa . Pa was n't easy to fool like Mama and Mother were . He 'd say he won it in manual training at school for his work . That would make Pa proud of him . He shoved the flashlight in his back pocket , and it bulged , bulged as much as if it were a gun . He walked along State Street , trying to make up his mind whether to stay down a little longer or else go out around home and get in the fight with the niggers . He looked at his money , only a dollar left . He had spent a lot of money today , and he had eaten too much . But he was n't sorry . Only , he had to figure a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a box of Murad cigarettes . The clerk in the cigar store had been dumb , and when he had said you got to have a note to get cigarettes when you 're a minor , he told the clerk they were for his boss , and the clerk believed him . He opened the box , took out a cigarette , lit it . Ah , he felt like a king . There was n't many kids who had his luck . None of the kids around La Salle Street did . They did n't smoke the cigarettes he smoked . They had to snipe butts on the street . He inhaled , thinking how much smarter , how much better off he was than kids like Big Ears Delaney . Maybe tomorrow if he saw Big Ears he 'd give him a Murad . He could see Big Ears ' eyes popping , and he could hear Big Ears asking did he get these off his uncle . He would be mysterious and not tell Big Ears where they came from . Let him guess . Hell , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man and have all the money he wanted to spend on everything he wanted . But , gee . . . Uncle Al was cominghis way , across the street . He turned , ran across Statep227Street . A horse-and-wagon burst through the line of waiting traffic . Bill did not see it . He was knocked down , and run over , but when the wheel passed over his leg he gritted his teeth , closed his fists , dug his fingernails into his palms , so as not to yell . He lay , feeling as if his leg were crushed , numbed from the pain in it . But he would n't cry . Uncle Al might hear , and recognize his voice . Weak , his consciousness almost fading , he hid his head as the crowd gathered around . Uncle Al might be one of these people . A man was bending over him , asking him was he hurt , and what was his name ? He weakly turned his head from the man . He moaned slightly . " I 'm hurt ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be careful and hide his head so Uncle Al did n't see him if Uncle Al was in the crowd . He fainted . Walking briskly down State Street , Al saw the crowd gathering in the street , heard a woman scream , and knew that it was an accident . Men scurried by him . He heard one man say that a kid had been run over by a wagon , and he heard another say that the driver was a foreigner and did n't stop with the traffic cop 's whistle . A kid being run over made him think of Danny . It could happen to Danny . Perspiration broke on his brow at the thought of this possibility . He stopped in his tracks , frightened into a trance , seeing Danny in his mind , run over , killed . He shook himself . It had n't happened yet . He would tell Mother and Peg to not let him play in the street . He would talk to Danny . And God would protect the little fellow . He was again aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the accident had occurred . He took a step to see for himself . He turned , kept on his way . He had an appointment with a buyer and he would just make it . It was wrong to be late for business engagements , even a minute late . A man should let nothing interfere with business.  |p228He  walked briskly on to his appointment . Even if it would have wasted only a minute , a minute was time , and time was money . No one with whom he did business could say he was ever even a minute late , if he could help it.  | HE was mad as a bull . And , Peg , your heart would have bled for the little fellow if you saw him crying in bed when I carried his supper into him . He was just like a frightenedlittle rabbit , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said as she and Margaret sat in the kitchen , vegetables on the stove filling the room with the odor of cooking food . " Al has his nerve . Of course , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill said to little Danny . But Willie-boy is n't to blame . It 's his home environment . That place on La Salle Street is not a fit place to raise a dog in , " Margaret said , puffing away at a cigarette . " Praise be to God , my grandson Daniel does n't have to live in it with the O'Neills , Peg . He 's not an O'Neill . He 's a Fox , and he takes after me own people . Sometimes when I do look at him , I think that he 's the spittin ' image of me own father . " " It 's certainly grand , Mother , that we can give the little darling a decent home . " " Yes , but poor Lizz , she has a hard time of it , the poor thing . " " She does n't have any harder a life than I do , working the way I have to at the hotel . Sometimes I think that my head is going to split wide open , I have such a headache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me with checks , and every one of them will cheat me if he gets a chance . They are n't even honest . And I have to balance , watch every penny , and keep making change like a machine . I have a job that is made for a machine , not for a young girl like me , " Margaret said self-pityingly.  | " And do n't I know that you work hard , Peg , " the mother said , filling her clay pipe , as Peg strode over to the stove and lifted the lid on the pot of boiling potatoes . " This is going to be a wonderful supper , Mother , " Peg exclaimed , turning from the stove , and then she added , thoughtfully , " No , Mother , I do n't blame the boy . I accuse the mother . The only time that that poor consumptive Willieboyever sees what a decent home is like , and ever knows what it means to eat good healthy food , is when he comes up here . Lizz is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , Mother , even if she is my own flesh and blood , " Margaret said , again sitting down . " Ah , Peg , you say the truth , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said after lighting her pipe . " Many a woman is as poor as our Lizz . Because she is poor , that 's no reason why she ca n't at least keep herself clean . Water costs nothing , and she could buy all the soap she needs , with the money she spends filling those poor little babes she has with that awful doughy cake and those indigestible sweet rolls she 's always stuffing them with . When they grow up , they wo n't have a good tooth in their poor little heads , and their stomachs will be ruined , ruined . And she always has rags and papers all over the house . No , Mother , there is no earthly excuse for her , none whatsoever . She is just lazy and she 's always gossiping with those dirty neighbor women in that old Irish , back-fence , old-fashioned way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I could n't be bothered listening to her like that . It 's common , and it always makes me think of what me mother said , Do n't show me bread in another man 's window . ' What she says to me goes in one ear and out the other . " " And that poor ruptured hard-working husband of hers . She gives him no home . She gives him no peace . What kind of a life can poor Jim have with her ? I tell you , Mother , it 's no wonder that the poor man takes a drink now and then . Any man would under such circumstances . What surprises me isp231that he is n't drunk all the time , having to put up with a woman like Lizz . And I say that , even if she is my own sister . She was always common . Remember when she was home with us , and she was working out as a servant with Mrs. Lynn on Drexel Boulevard ? She came home every night fillingus full of servant talk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have had children like Al and me , and a daughter like Lizz . My heart sometimes aches for those poor little ones she has . I wish I could take Little Margaret and keep her here , raise her like a girl should be raised . " Again Margaret became self-pitying . " Raise her like I never was raised . " " A girl is too hard to raise , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said curtly . " How can that lovely innocent little child ever be anything , living under such a roof ? " Margaret said in disgust . " My Lizz means well . The poor thing ! " " I wonder what time that man is coming home . I wish that he would call up if he 's going to be late . I do n't know when to put on the meat , " Margaret said with sudden petulance , getting up to pace back and forth across the kitchen . " He 'll be home soon . He 's out working hard to keep a roof over his mother 's head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mother , Al is a wonderful boy , and I do n't deny it . And he does work hard . He has get-up and go to him . He does n't sleep all day like Ned used to when Ned was home . But he has the ugliest temper . When he loses it , I am sometimes afraid of him . Some day Mother , with that temper of his , Al is liable to kill some one . " " My Al , he would n't hurt a lamb . He just works hard , and he does worry about business . He has so many things on his mind , the poor boy . " " As far back as I can remember , he had his temper . He must have gotten it from Father . Father had a temper , too . Al was always dictatorial . When I was a poor little girl , half blind and needing glasses , and hardly able to walk after coming out of the County Hospital from diphtheria , he beat me.  |p232He  beat me because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I live . Not that I hold it against Al . " " Last night , he was so mad I was afraid he was going to hit the little fellow . " " If I ever catch him touching a hair of the boy 's head ! If I ever catch him ! He 'll never do it a second time . I 'll have him put behind bars . I wo n't let him do to Daniel what he and Lizz did to me when I was a thin , half-starved little thing , half dead on my feet from diphtheria . I wo n't , Mother ! " " Peg , sure he loves the little fellow like a father . He would give his right arm for my grandson , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said , contentedly puffing on her corncob . " Peg , here he is . Put the meat on ! " Mrs. O'Flaherty commandedas they heard Al coming in the front door . " Hello , Al ! We were waiting for you before we ' fried the steak , " Peg called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stove and Al yelled a cheery hello out to them . " Where 's Dan ? " he asked , coming into the kitchen coatless , smiling , and carrying a small bundle . " Son ! Son ! Your uncle wants you , " the grandmother shouted . " Al , you should n't have been so mean to him last night . The poor child has been so sad all day . He did n't go out to play after school , and he just went about the house like he was heartbroken , " Margaret said reprimandingly . " I did n't want to , and I did n't do it for pleasure , " Al repliedapologetically . " It 's just that he has to learn certain things , and if he does n't learn them now , he never will . We want to bring the boy up like a gentleman is raised , not like Lizz and Jim are bringing up his brothers and sisters . " " I was just telling Mother that Lizz is the last person in the world that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Peg , between you and me and the lamppost , she and Jim better start doing something about Bill . If he grows up withp233the nature he has now , it 's going to be Joliet or worse for him . And everybody get this straight . You too , Mother ! He does n't get inside of our door again . He 's a bad influence on Danny . And he abused our hospitality and our courtesy by lying to us . Why , Peg , he stood before me last night and lied like a trooper . And , listen , wait until I see him ! I 'm going to put some sense into that head of his , even if I got to pound it in . Why , Peg , do you know that he denied ever telling any such thing to the little fellow , " Al said , spelling out his last words because Danny had come into the kitchen . " But , hello there , Sport , how are you , and what did you do today ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ingenuousness impelling them all to smile tenderly upon him . " Al ! Al ! My grandson is going to be the best scholar in the Sisters ' school , " the grandmother said . " Here , I bought this for you . But brighten up , smile ! .. . That 's the way , " Al said , rubbing Danny 's curly brown hair with feigned roughness , handing him the package he had been holding . " Let me open it for you and see what Uncle Al brought you , Brother , " Peg said , reaching for the package . " Nix , nix on the rush act ! " Al said to Peg with mock gruffness , arresting her hand in mid-air . " It 's for Sport here , and he 's a little man and can open his own presents , " Al said , not hearing Danny thanking him . " Daniel , your uncle is so good to you . If you grow up to be as good a man as he is , you 'll never break your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Al beaminglywatched Danny open the package and pull out a red -- md-white stocking cap and a pair of mittens which matched it . " Oh , they 're so cute , so sweet , Al . Try them on , Brother ! " Margaret said . " He 'll be the most beautiful boy in school , wearing all the fine clothes his uncle buys him , " the grandmother said while Danny put on the cap and mittens and stood to be looked atp234in the way that he knew he should . " He 's such a pretty boy , Peg , is n't he , Al ? " " He looks so adorable , " Peg said . " He 's a real Sport now , are n't you , Dan ? " Al said , giving his nephew a light and playful touch on the chin with his left fist . " Goodness , I have to turn the steak , " Margaret said , going to the stove , turning over the sizzling meat . " Uh huh ! . . . Yes , sir ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you play in the street much ? " Al asked gravely . " I was n't out today , " Danny said guardedly . " Al , he was such a darling good boy , " Peg said sweetly . " Well , do n't play on the street . Play all you want to on the sidewalk , or in the back yard or the vacant lots . But do n't play and run in the street . Stay off it . And when you cross the street , be sure and look carefully in all directions , and if anything is coming , wait , let it pass . Never run in front of an automobile or a wagon . " " Little Brother is so careful , Al , " Peg said . " A kid was run over by a wagon downtown on State Street . It made me think of Danny . We better train him to be cautious in crossing the streets . These days , there are more and more automobiles in use every day . " " Al , was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor mother do ? " exclaimed the grandmother . " I do n't know . I did n't see him , or the accident . I had to rush to keep a business appointment . But I heard people saying the kid 's leg was broken , and that it was a foreigner driving the wagon that hit him . " " Oh , how terrible ! Brother , " Aunt Margaret said , wrappingher own hands over Danny 's mittened ones . " Brother , before you cross the street , you must always watch to see that the road is clear . " " And if a policeman is on the street , have him take you across , " Al said.  | " And , Brother , promise your aunt that you 'll never go across Grand Boulevard alone . There are too many automobiles on it now , " Aunt Margaret said , and Danny promised with a nod of his head . She turned toward Al . " I always did believe that any mother worthy of the name would n't let her child go downtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mothers of this world should be put behind bars , behindbars ! " " Yes , Peg , a lot of parents are just plain fatheads . You know , it would be just like Lizz to have her kids hurt that way . But here , Sport , you run and put your presents away and wear them when it gets cold enough , " Al said , and Danny instantly obeyed . " Better be washing for supper . It 's almost ready , " Peg said . " Right away , Peg ! But , say , that food smells delicious , " Al said , going to the bathroom . " Peg , that was a lovely supper , " Al said , leaning back in his chair , rubbing his hand across his belly . " We worked hard cooking it , we did , " the mother said , receiving an indulgent smile from her daughter . " Sport , you get me a cigar . You 'll find one in the outside pocket of my suit coat , " Al said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall . " I hate to think of him ever growing up . He 's at such a lovely age now , " Margaret said , smiling wanly . " There 's some that run away and forget all you ever done for them after they 're raised . But if my grandson does that , I 'll tan his backside inside out , " Mrs.  --  ' Flaherty said . " Nobody 's ever putting anything over on a wise doll like you , are they , Mother ? " Al said affectionately . " Al , for Mother , the sun never sets on you and Danny , " Peg said . " Maybe I never went to school , but I met the scholars , " the mother said.  | " Thanks , Sport , " Al said , taking the cigar from Danny , cutting off the edge with his pearl-handled penknife , putting a match to it , puffing , while Danny watched him , wishing that he owned a knife with a pearl handle like Uncle Al 's , and if he did , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his finger . " Peg , let 's do the dishes . I want you to read me what they been doing in the newspapers , " Mrs. O'Flaherty said , starting to stack the dishes . " Mother just loves me to read her the murder stories in the papers . She eats it up , " Peg said . " Indeed I do n't . What do I care about people that 's killin ' one another like pigs ? Ah , if they had the fear of God in them , the way me mother in the old country put the fear of God in me , they would n't be killin ' one another like pigs , and sinnin ' like the animals that run in the bush . Indeed , I do n't . I want you to read me the death notices to see if anyone I know from the old country has passed on , " the mother said , and as she spoke the telephone rang . " I 'll answer it , " Peg said , jumping up so fast that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that it might be Lorry phoning for her . " Mama ! Mama ! Here 's my money man ! " Little Margaret gleefully shouted , dropping her paper cut-outs and rushing to her father as he came in the house from work . " And what are you ? " Jim asked , lifting the girl up , kissing her , swinging her high over his head until she ooed and shrieked with delight . " Papa 's girl , " she giggled , and Jim continued to hold her aloft . Feeling Dennis and Little Robert clambering and clutching at his feet and legs , Jim proudly reflected that these children were his . He was their father . He was a man , and here was his family . And some day he was going to give his family ap237decent home . He set Little Margaret down and swung his two boys on his shoulders in succession , causing them likewise to shriek and giggle with joy . He went to the bedroom and , noticing his sleeping infant , he looked at it with awe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . " Hello , Pa ! OOH ! Our Pa has come home ! Our Pa has come home ! Our Pa has come home ! Our money man is back ! Our money man is back ! Our money man is back ! " Lizz singsongedbefore him in the dining room , jigging with slopping old slippers , her decayed teeth sticking out of her smile like sores , the dirty rag under her chin almost falling off . " How 's the girl today ? " Jim asked after he had perfunctorilykissed his wife . " Oh , Jim , my bones ache , and I have so much to do around here . I hardly have time to sit down and drink a cup of tea . And I 'm almost never free to pay a visit to the Blessed Sacramentas every Catholic woman should do . I tell you , Jim , I 'll be glad when we have this regiment raised . And my teeth ache so ! It seems to me that with all the money the O'Flahertys got , they could help us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't got any money . And even if they did , I would n't be beholden to them , or to any man . I tell you , Lizz , old girl , we 've gone this far . We 'll manage somehow to go the rest of the way , " Jim said , his voice softening as he concludedhis remarks . " Supper will be ready very soon . The baby was crying and I had to change her diapers , and I could n't start on it early enough , " Lizz said . " No hurry . But say , where 's Bill ? " " He did n't come home from school . He must have gone to the O'Flahertys . " " Why did you let him ? " Jim asked , nettled . " I did n't . He did n't come home . He must have gone there straight from school . " " Goddamn it , I told you I do n't want him going up to the O'Flahertys all the time ! If his family and his own homep238ai n't good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll soon make it so ! " " Jim , his brother Danny loves to see him and cries for him . " " And you say he did n't come home from school to find out if you wanted him to do anything for you ? " " Maybe my mother had something she wanted him to do , and he forgot to tell me when he went to school this morning.  --  " She did ? Well , let me say that she had her goddamn nerve . Having things for my kid to do . Well , tell her to hire a nigger to do them ! I 'm going to call them up and give them a piece of my mind , and tell them to send Bill straight home . If it 's the last thing I do on earth , I 'll see to it that he stays out of that house ! They 're spoiling one of my kids . Well , they ai n't going to spoil another ! " " Jim , please do n't ! Al 's home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't fight with yours . And I 'll have supper ready in a second . It 'll get cold if you go out to telephone . Please , Jim ! " He pushed her entreating arm aside and rushed to the bedroom for his coat and cap . He bolted out of the house and went snarling over to Wentworth Avenue . A fellow passing him said hello , but he did n't even hear the greeting . Goddamn the OTlahertys ! Goddamn all aunts , and uncles , and brothersin-law , and sisters-in-law , and mothers-in-law ! Goddamn all relations ! And he was through just telling Bill to stay away from them . When Bill got home , he 'd blister some obedience and respect for his home on Bill 's ass ! He crashed into Green 's drugstore at Twenty-fifth and Wentworth , and he jammed into the telephone booth as if he wanted to knock it to smithereens. v " Hello ! " Margaret called into the mouthpiece , her body as taut as a strung wire.  | " This is Jim . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she replied in a sinking voice when she recognized that it was n't Lorry . " Jim O'Neill ! Who is this ? Margaret ? " " Oh , hello , Jim ! How are you ? And how is Lizz ? Is there anything wrong ? " " Is that Jim O'Neill ? Tell him I want to speak to him , " Al called from the dining room . " Why , no , Jim , he is n't . He has n't been here all day , " she said . " You say he was n't ? " Jim bellowed into the phone . " Let me speak to him , " Al said , standing tense by his sister 's side . " He did n't come home from school , and his mother thought that he 'd gone up to your place . " " He must just be out playing , then . We have n't seen him since yesterday , " Peg said . " Well , I wonder where he can be ? " Jink said , his anger evaporating into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " Al said , standing on tiptoes , scarcely able to contain himself while Margaret went on tellingJim again and again that Bill was n't here , and that he must be out playing somewheres . " Well , Jim , no news is good news , " Margaret said . " Let me speak to him ! " " And another thing I want to say is this ! Do n't be asking Bill up there to run errands , and be keeping him there . His mother needs him to help her around the house . " " But , Jim , we never ask him to raise a hand . And , of course , we 're always glad to see him , but we do n't force him to come here . And , of course , Jim , if you do n't want him coming here , we wo n't have him . You 're his father . " " We are , like hell , glad to see him , " Al said under his breath . " And I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice. 240 A WORLD I " Al ! " Peg exclaimed , shocked and indignant as her brother grabbed the phone out of her hands . " Hello , Jim ! How are you ? " " Pretty good , Al , all things considered . I just called to see if Bill was there , but Margaret tells me he is n't . " " I wanted to talk to you about him , Jim . " " Five cents , please , " the operator said , and Al heard Jim telling the operator just a minute , and then he faintly heard the click of a coin . " Jim , are n't there things he can do to help Lizz around your house instead of coming up here so much ? " Al said . " I told him not to , and I told his mother not to let him , and not to be giving him carfare to go on . " " You know , Jim , it is n't that we begrudge anything that we can do for you and Lizz and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our heads . But he is n't good for Danny . " " What do you mean ? " Jim asked , partially controlling his anger and at the same time thinking how he would like to have his hands around the neck of that sawed-off dude salesmanthis very minute . " It 's hard to speak about over the telephone , " Al said , striving to keep his temper under control . " Bill 's his own brother . He ought to be better company for the boy than a lot of kids that come from dude homes , " Jim said heatedly . " Just a minute , Jim ! Just a minute ! Do n't lose your tem-per . " " I 'm not . But it 's a funny thing for an uncle to say to a father about his two kids . " " Do n't fight with him , Al ! Please ! He 's got an awful disposition , and he 's beneath you . " " Now , Jim , if you 'll hold your horses a minute , I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticklish subject to bring up over the telephone . " " I 'm holding them ! " Jim said , choking with resentmentp241and humiliation , realizing that if he was n't a miserable pauper Danny would not be with them , and he would n't be having to have this shoved down his throat . " Well , you see , Jim , it seems that Bill told things to Danny that he ought n't to know , things about . . . babies .. . how you and Lizz have them . " " When ? What do you mean ? " " The Facts of Life . He told the boy about the Facts of Life , and Danny went to Mother and Peg and asked them questions . You know , the kid here , Jim , is too young to have his head filled with . . . with the Facts of Life , " Al said , embarrassed . " Why , I 'll break his neck ! " Jim said , turning pale in the telephone booth , suffering suddenly from a complex of shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him and Lizz , and the realization that Al had indirectly referred to him and Lizz in bed , coupled with self-disgust because he was a man , with a man 's desires for his woman . " He ought to be taken in hand , Jim , " Al said after a pause . " Listen , Al , " Jim sputtered . " I do n't mean no hard feelings , and I ai n't got nothing against you . But I 'm the boy 's father . And I do n't need to be told how to raise him . I 'm the only one who is ever going to take him in hand . And I 'm able to do it ! " " Jim , please , please do n't misunderstand me . I 'm not trying to tell you how to raise your kids . All I 'm saying is that we do n't want Bill coming up here so much . " " You wo n't be bothered with him any more . If I learn of his going up there , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we do n't like him . We do . We give him spending money , and we treat him fine . It 's just that he feeds Danny the wrong kind of talk . And when he has to go to the bathroom , he takes Danny in with him and locks tl " door . " " What do you mean ? "  | " I do n't mean that there 's anything in it , except that it just is n't right for the little fellow . " " Lots of things are n't right for him . I 'll say that much . " " And yesterday , when I came home , Bill was here , and I tried to talk with him about what he had told Danny , and he lied right to my face and ran out of the house . " " When was this ? " " Yesterday , just before supper . " " Did n't he have supper at your house ? " " No . He ran out after lying to my face . " Jim was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goddamn O'Flaherty blood . Once an O'Flaherty , always an O'Flaherty , he guessed . " You can understand , Jim , it is n't that we do n't want him , tar .. " I know . Thanks , Al , " Jim curtly interrupted . " And Jim , old man , I do n't want you to have any hard feelings about this . " " I wo n't ! " Jim said , almost swallowing his own words . " We 'd like to see you and Lizz soon . " " I 'm busy . I 'm a workingman . " " Well , give our love to Lizz . " " Say , let me speak to Danny a minute before I hang up ! " He waited while they called Danny . He heard them talking to him , heard Danny asking what would he say . " Hello , Papa ? " " Hello , Boy ! How are you , and when are you going to see your Papa ? " " Papa , I 'm learning to read and write . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears almost welling up in his eyes . " And Uncle Al bought me a new cap and pair of mittens today . " Jim could still hear the O'Flahertys coaching his son on what to say . He could n't talk to the boy now . " You be a good boy , and your father and mother will see you soon . "  | " Yes , Papa . " " Goodbye , Boy ! " " Goodbye , Papa . " Jim walked slowly out of the drugstore . He stopped in front of the saloon opposite it . He stood there , hesitant . He walked on , still slowly . He did n't care what they said , Bill was a decent kid , and he would turn out better than Danny if his goddamn mother did n't ruin him . But why should Bill have lied and said he had eaten supper there last night ? Where did he eat ? Hell , he did n't give a good goddamn ! Wait till he came home ! He was going to pound some truth into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit on it , started chewing , spat it out . " Al , did something happen to Willie-boy ? " Peg asked as they went back to the dining room . " If I could get my hands on your Willie-boy , something would happen to him , " Al said . " What did Jim say ? " she asked with increasing curiosity . " He did n't like what I told him , and he went on saying that he was Bill 's father , and he would take care of Bill . Well , Jesus Christ , then why does n't he ? All that I wanted to tell him was to keep Bill away from here , and to watch Bill for Bill 's own good . And he gets sore . You know , Peg , Jim is crude . You have to be exceedingly diplomatic with him . He flies off the handle at the least provocation , " Al said . " Al , it 's no skin off your backside . Let the O'Neills stew in their own juice , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any right to get on a high horse ? " Margaret haughtily asked . " Them what has to ' umble must ' umble , " the mother said . " A common ordinary teamster who ca n't even support the kids he brought into this world with his own pleasure ! " " Be careful , Peg ! " Al said , touching her wrist , winking in Danny 's direction.  | " Him with his pride , when he is only an ordinary teamster , and he has his kids in rags , and we often got to scrape and sacrifice ourselves so they do n't go hungry , " Margaret sneered . " He ca n't help that , I guess . He had no education , " Al said . " What education did I have ? Or you ? We both went to work at an age when other kids were in school . But are we like Jim ? " " You know , Peg , Jim has no innate refinement , " Al said . " Them what has to ' umble must ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The day that I saw Lizz bringing that lanky , bucktoothedgawk home , I asked myself , was this the best she could get ? " Margaret said contemptuously . " He does n't have an innate refinement . You have to be very diplomatic with him or else he flies off the handle . I do n't like people who are that way , " Al said . " Do n't fight with him , Al . He 's beneath you , " Peg said . " Al , when you see him , fist him ! Fist him good ! If you ca n't , I 'll hire the butcher to . I 'll give him five dollars to blacken both Jim O'Neill 's eyes , " the grandmother said . " But , Al , what happened to Bill ? What do you think ? " " Sure , he 's runnin ' the prairie somewheres , " said the mother . " Do you think the police locked him up for stealing or something ? " Peg asked . " If they did n't this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand pretty damn quick . " " You know , Al , I do n't trust that boy . And I think he has consumption , too . He looks consumptive . That 's why I do n't want him coming up here and playing with Danny so much , " Peg said . " All he 's got is too damn much nerve for one his age , " Al said.  | " He has n't been there all day . Where is he ? " Jim asked Lizz , pointing his finger accusingly at her . " Jesus , Mary , and Joseph , how should I know ? " " You 're his mother ! " " Yes , I 'm his mother . I suffered in the valley of the shadow of death bringing him into the world , bringing all your kids into this shitpot of a home you give them . And you are the boy 's father . You owe a responsibility to God for the boy . If anything happens to him , the finger of God 's guilt will point at you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in semihysteria . " I work damn hard , and damn long hours every day to put some food into their mouths . The least you could do is to know where your kids are ! " " Mama , I 'm hungry . I want to eat , " Little Margaret said , pulling at her mother 's skirt . " Look what time it is ! And the babies have to come crying for their supper . " " Supper would have been on the table if you did n't go running out of here to insult my people , my people who are raising a child you ca n't support . They go without themselves to keep one of your offspring , " Lizz said sarcastically , jigging as she spoke . " Well , the little boy is n't staying with your family any longer . He 's coming here to take the same pot luck that his brothers and sisters take . " " You pauper , you ca n't feed him ! And if you take him , my mother 'll stick a knife in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goddamn relation you got . .. Yes , and I 'll make them like it , too ! " " I 'm hungry , " Dennis moaned . " Give them their supper ! " Jim said . " You ai n't a cripple ! " " And if you were a mother , and had raised Bill right , wep246would n't be wondering where in God 's name he was this very minute , " Jim said , his voice strained . " If you 'll stay home and change stinking diapers , I 'll go out and work . I 'll scrub floors for my babies ! Oh , good Jesus , Mary , and Joseph , why , why did n't I go into the convent ? " " I wish to Christ I knew why , " Jim said , slumping into a chair . " I did n't , because I listened to all the honeyed words you fed me . You and your promises ! Look at them all around here now , in all this shit ! You telling me what we would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't live without me . And me , innocent virgin that I was , I believed you . Oh , why was I such a fool ? " " Well , Lizz , you ai n't the only fool there 's been in this world . Do n't you know that poem ? A fool there was , and he made his prayer , To a rag , a bone , and a hank of hair . " " Say , what the hell do you think you are , a gold brick ? " " Oh , for Christ sake , shut up ! You give me a headache ! " Jim said , stepping toward her with clenched fists . " Hit me ! Hit me . And I 'll leave you . I have a mother to go to . " Jim winced , turned aside . He saw the children huddled together , sobbing . He could n't realize that these poor little beggars were his , that they had come out of his groins , and they were his flesh and blood . Suddenly , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill ? Where was he ? He went to the kitchen , took the supper off the stove , started bringing it into the dining room . The children watched him with tearful , frightened gazes . " And so this , this is the payment I get for taking care of your home and your stinking kids , " Lizz sneered . " I suppose they ai n't yours ? " " I did n't want them . I was a virgin . " " I wish to Jesus I knew what you ever do want . "  | " All I wanted was to serve and honor the Man Above . I would have been a Poor Clare doing God 's work for the poor , only for you . " " You could n't have gotten into a convent . They make the nuns wash their faces , " Jim said , returning to the kitchen for plates . " Come on , for Christ sake , turn off the faucet , " he said , seeing her in tears as he came back to the dining room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost ! " she exclaimed , blessing herself and dropping to her knees . " Go ahead and pray like a hypocrite . A hell of a lot of good such prayers do . " " How dare you blaspheme ! " she yelled , jumping to her feet . " Why in hell do n't you stop neighing like a goddamn horse ? " " Ah , God will punish you ! God will punish you ! " " If I could afford it , I 'd buy a phonograph . I 'd rather hear it than you . " " Hail , Mary , full of grace , the Lord is with Thee , " Lizz began intoning . " Come on , you kids , here 's your supper . Your mother is too busy praying to eat hers , " Jim said , and the cowed childrencame slowly to the table . Dishing out food for them , Jim cast a look of disgust at his wife . Just then there was a rap on the door . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who it was . " Mr. O'Neill ? " a huge policeman asked . " Why , yes , Officer ! Come in ! " Jim said , a lump rising in his throat . " Oh , Officer , what is the matter ? " Lizz asked , rushing forward . " What 's the trouble , Officer ? " Jim asked . " Officer , do you know my mother 's first cousin , Sergeant O'Leary at Grand Crossing station ? He 's my mother 's firstp248cousin , and his people come from Mullingar in County Westmeath ? " " Why , no , mam , I do n't . Mr. O'Neill , have you a son named William O'Neill ? " " Yes , " Jim gasped . " Officer , he 's such a good boy . He never did a bad thing in his life . Why , he would n't even steal a pin , " Lizz said . " He has n't done anything wrong , " the policeman said . " What happened , Officer ? " Jim asked , almost dizzy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was run over by a wagon in the Loop , and his leg is broken . . . " " Jesus Mary and Joseph ! " Lizz exclaimed , flinging her arms in the air , fainting in a heap on the floor . They lifted her onto the couch . Jim ran to the kitchen for water . Bill ! His favorite son ! And where would the money come from ? Would n't it ever let up on him ? Jesus , what had he done to merit this calamity on top of everything else ? He turned the faucet off , walked back to the parlor with a glass of water . The policeman was fanning her with a handkerchief.  | MARGARET walked across the lobby of the Union Hotel , her day 's work done . She was not so tired today , and she knew that she looked well in her new blue serge suit and her wide hat with the birds on it . She had n't really been able to afford these , but she could n't go around in rags . And all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so did all her girl friends . She could n't let herself look like a pauper . But , God , she was getting nervous . When was she going to get some money from Lorry ? When would he be back in town ? She had n't seen him in months . Oh , God , she ached for him . But he ought to be here soon . Even if she was worried about her cashbox , well , everything would happen for the best . Last night she had sent a dollar to the Poor Glares in a letter asking them to pray for her special intention . God would heed the prayers of the good nuns , and He would not have the auditor check on her until she put back that money she 'd borrowed from her cashbox . She was sure that God would not let her down , after all the good she did for her family , for Lizz and the kids , for everybody . But just think of it ! Who , seeing the skinny child that she was ten or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child would have grown up into this well-dressed , handsome , worldly girl that she now was as she walked across the hotel lobby , leaving a good job after her day 's work ? Who ? Ah , strange were the ways of life ! Who then would have said that while all the girls she knew would love and marry motormen , and teamsters , and piker salesmen and clerks , she would get a millionaire as her lover , a man as fine , P252as brainy , as handsome as her Lorry Robinson was ? Ah , yes , strange were the ways of life ! But she did hope that God would answer the prayers the Poor Clares would say for her . She did hope that He would see to it that Lorry would be in Chicago soon , and that he would give her the money she needed . She stopped . There was Brophy , sitting comfortably in a chair by the door near the edge of the lobby . Should she go out the other entrance ? No , she would n't ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while her hatred for the man flared like a hot fire inside of her . She would walk right past him . The little rat ! The little teacup imitation of a man ! Oh , there was no word contemptible enough to describe him ! Oh , that she were a man for five minutes that she might hit him ! She would walk right by him , her head flung high , wearing her new hat and suit that were so becoming . She would walk right by him , a handsome woman that he could never have , and yes , after she passed , she would shove her ass out at him to let the runt know what she thought of him . She could tell , too , that he had seen her . His eyes were on her . Good ! Now she would walk right by him as if he were such an insignificant little thing that she did not even know that he existed . He was getting up . It was gratifying to her to realize that he was not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was just a little runt that Lorry could break with one hand . Why , he even looked a little bit dried up , and she would n't be surprised if there was nothing at all in his pants . Oh , would n't it be wonderful to have Lorry ruin him , destroy him , take away every penny he owned . Why , this little crooked lying runt saying on the witness stand in Washington that her Lorry was a blackmailer ! Oh , would n't she love to spit in his eye ! Oh , would n't she love to cut the nuts right off him ! Would n't she ! He was standing up . She was passing him . He was in back of her , and she would bet that those rat eyes of his were justP253trying to ferret holes in her back . She brushed through the doorway , smiling to Alex , the doorman . " You seem to be in a very great hurry , my young lady , " Brophy said to her outside the hotel . She stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really expected this to happen , even though the thought of it had not dawned upon her . It was something that she had known was going to happen without knowing it . " I have things to do , " she said decisively , meeting his gaze unflinchingly . " I imagined you did from the way you went out of the hotel . Miss O'Flaherty , if you only knew how very charming you looked walking through the lobby as if you had a grudge against all the world ! The only thing that I could compare you to was to a fine racehorse . It occurred to me that I could well understand why , say , a man I would know in my business , I 'm in the lumber business , you know , but as I say , a man I know in my business would find you to be a deucedly interesting young woman . " " What do you mean ? I 'm not accustomed to being insulted on the street by strange men . " " I 'm complimenting you , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers after all the checks of mine that you have o.k 'd ? " " it might be meaningless for me to want anything . " " I am in a hurry . " " But on the contrary , if you were not in such a hurry , why , you might be very interested in what I want . Of course , if you are in too great a hurry , you might just dash away from something that might be to our mutual advantage . " " Mr. Brophy , I do n't like beating around the bush . What are you talking about ? " " Now , Miss O'Flaherty , you are talking like the sensible girl that I 've always believed you to be . Only we ca n't veryP254well talk here . You know we might be disrupting the , ah , pedestrian traffic . As you know , we in Chicago are having a deuce of a time with our traffic problem . In fact , I 'm on a committee to study it . " " I know what you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " But , Miss O'Flaherty , let 's be logical . Now if you know what I want to talk about , why do you say that you know nothing about it ? " " Because you think you can get something out of me . " " Please ! Please , my dear girl ! I do n't want to get something out of you . I pay for anything I get . And perhaps I might be giving you something , so that it might even develop that you are doing more of the getting than I am . You never can tell , particularly when one is dealing with a young woman as smart and as handsome as you are , if you will permit me to talk in such terms of . . . of familiarity . " " Well , what is it ? Spit it out ! " " Now , Miss O'Flaherty , if you have the time , we can stop some place for a cup of tea , and we can talk . You know , since my last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the afternoon . " " I have n't much time . " " Perhaps we could stop at the Shrifton for a moment . " " Come on ! " She strode along , and the few inches of added height she had over Brophy showed more plainly as they walked . Several men were walking together side by side , blocking the sidewalk , and since they did not split to let Margaret and Brophy through , Brophy took her arm to lead her around them . She drew in . He looked at her , annoyed . He shrugged his shoulders , smiled at some inward thought . She was thinking that she would let him talk , and then she would tell everything to Lorry . It would show Lorry how much she loved him , how much she was ready to do for him . And she knew that this little runt would offer her money . She would throw it in hisP255face . She would tell him to stick his tainted money up his ass-hole ! She would n't betray her Lorry ! But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembled every time her boss , Mr. Harding , came up to her desk for fear that he was going to tell her that the auditor was around . And still with no word and not one cent from Lorry . If he was going to ignore her that way , she had a right to fend for herself and get money somehow . He ought to know that if she wrote him for money , she needed it . If he ignored her , it would serve him right if she dealt with Brophy . But no , no , never ! She would go to jail first ! She would lose her bond and be blacklisted from every hotel in the city before she would betray him . And then after that sacrifice , after she was disgraced , she would find peace , peace from all the troubles of this unhappy world in the cold waters of Lake Michigan . But even then Lorry might never never know what she had done for him , how much she had loved him , how much of her heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . A smile supplanted the look of a tragic heroine which had accompanied these thoughts . All was not yet lost ! She had not been audited yet . And she might worm some money out of Brophy without telling him a thing . But God was witness to her vow that she would starve , die in gutters , go in rags before she would ever be a Judas and betray the man she loved . " Are you sure that you do n't want to change your mind , Miss O'Flaherty , and have a drink ? " Brophy graciously asked as they sat at a table in a corner of the Blue Room of the Shrifton Hotel , while a string orchestra gently played The Rosary . " I never drink , Mr. Brophy , " she said , cockily telling herself that she was up to his game , that she knew he wanted to try and get her drunk and then worm things out of her . Well , P256she would show this funny little fox a thing or two . She smiled genially and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't object to your drinking . " " No , thanks , I never touch it . Not during the day , at least . Once in a while I take a cocktail in the evening . But , Miss O'Flaherty , it occurs to me that I have known you for several years . " " Well , I should think you would . You 've been coming into the hotel ever since I started working there , and I have handled a number of your checks and vouchers . " " I use the hotel a great deal . " " I know it . Sometimes you telephone from there , " she said . " Yes , but never on the kind of business that I have been publicly accused of . But that 's neither here or there . I have lots of business engagements at your hotel , and I have to take a number of men to lunch . Sometimes , of course , I have to see lumber men there . In fact , I have sometimes heard associatesof mine in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purringly soft and overly gracious . " Of course , lumber men often stop at the hotel , and I handle their checks and vouchers the same as I do yours . " " One of my associates who has sometimes mentioned you is Lorry Robinson . " " He stays at the hotel often . He is a very nice man . " " He and I are stockholders in the same company out in Minnesota . " " A lot of his checks are drawn on Minnesota banks . " " I do n't see Lorry as much as I used to , even though we are partners in the same company . But there was a time when I saw a great deal more of him , and he used to tell me , if I remember correctly , that you were rather interested in him , and that you called him up a lot . Now you must forgive me , Miss O'Flaherty , if I am wrong , because I am not expressing my own opinion , but I remember him giving me the impression that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did not ! He absolutely did not ! " " Well , perhaps I was wrong . Maybe , Miss O'Flaherty , you know Lorry Robinson better than I know him , " Brophy said , smiling and suavely lifting a teacup as he spoke . Margaret suppressed the contempt for Brophy that welled within her . She felt her body growing tight . She wanted to scream , to scratch Brophy 's eyes out , to run away . And through her mind a sentence ran like a refrain . Play the game ! Play the game ! " Let 's be frank with each other , Miss O'Flaherty , " Brophy said , leaning across the table , becoming crisp and businesslike . " Yes , Mr. Brophy ! " she answered with false cordiality . " You have been reading the papers . You know about the Graham senatorial investigation . I have been given some notoriety in it . I am perfectly innocent . I am being blackmailedby my enemies . " " Oh , are you ? I read things in the papers . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A telephone call or something you were supposed to have made from Mr. Robinson 's room . " " Do you know the testimony I presented in Washington proving that I am being blackmailed by Lorry Robinson ? " " Why , I did n't know that , " she said innocently . 1The sonofabitch ! The sonofabitch ! she kept thinking to herself . " I might tell you , Miss O'Flaherty , that Lorry Robinson is not big enough , not smart enough , not powerful enough really to whip me by blackmail and perjury . He ca n't do it . And when he learns that he ca n't do it , he is going to pay dearly for that lesson , " Brophy continued , causing fright and worry to streak through Margaret 's mind , but she only revealedher emotions by a slight wrinkling of her brows . " Of course , Mr. Brophy , I 've always known that you were a very rich and influential man of affairs . " " I 'm going to talk point-blank to you , Miss O'Flaherty . P258If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead horse . He is already the loser in this unfortunate affair , and he has failed to do what he set out to do . Far from driving me off the board of directors of the Crown Point Lumber Company , he is off the board and discredited among most of the stockholders . And he has n't unloaded his stock on me at his price , either . And his testimony in Washington has been successfully refuted by my own , and by that of others . He overplayed his hand , and he is not , decidedly not , going to be the power in the lumber world that he thought he would be . I assure you that if you stick with him , you are sticking with a dead horse . " " I do n't understand you . I 'm only a hotel cashier . " " Yes , you do , Miss O'Flaherty . We understand each other quite clearly , " he said incisively , and she grinned back at him . " How are you going to do all this to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , reached across the table , chucked her chin . " You better be careful . If a private detective saw you doing that , it might be a scandal , " she said , her words intended to cut like a knife . " You 're a very clever girl , Miss O'Flaherty , " he said , unperturbedby her sharpness . " Come on , Mr. Brophy , put your cards on the table ! " she said with apparently sudden recklessness . " I will if you will put yours down . Now , what would you like in the way of gifts and money ? " " I ca n't be bribed . " " Now , please do n't speak of bribes . " " I 'm sorry , Mr. Brophy . I did n't mean to touch a sore spot . " " Let 's put the curtains aside and speak frankly . There is no use beating around the bush the fact that you and Lorry Robinson have been very . . . friendly . " " I wo n't admit anything . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly have learned by now that he is the same treacherous person in personal relationships as he is in business . You are experiencedenough in the ways of the world , I take it , to know something of the ways of a man with a maid , " he said , and she listened , controlling herself when she wanted to scream , wanted to pound and kick and scratch him , because he was low , because he was taking advantage of her , because he could sit and say such things about her , about Lorry , as coldly as if he were saying that it was a nice day . " Oh , yes ! Oh , yes , I know something about men , " she said , clenching her fists under the tablecloth , looking directly in his eyes as she spoke . " Well , then , you should sense what fate awaits your friendship with Lorry Robinson . You do n't think that some day you are going to be Mrs. Robinson , do you ? " " I do n't think that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , " she said . " Well , it does . Because , after all , what I want to talk to you about is to suggest something that is going to be to your own best interest . " " Oh , it is ! Well , it is good for a girl to look out for her own interest . If I had all along in life , I would be much better off than I am now , " Margaret said , lapsing into self-pity . " That 's the way I like to hear you talk ! " " Yes , Mr. Brophy , if you do n't look after your own p 's and q 's , you are never going to get anywheres in this world . " " Right you are , my girl . And we can make some things out to our own interest . " " How ? " Margaret said , anxiously thinking to herself how she might worm something out of this cold fish . " Now , you probably know certain facts about Mr. Robinson , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my lawyers , would be of great assistance to me in this case that is going on , this unfortunate investigation which my enemies are causing in the effort to blackmail and ruin me , "   " Could I ? What facts ? " " Well , facts about his personal life , and things that he might have told you about his business dealings and relationships . And when you see him , you could discover other things , his plans and the like . " " I do n't even know where he is . Do you ? " she said . " No . I guess he is out west somewhere . " " What would you do with what I told you ? " she quickly asked , thinking that Lorry must n't have gotten her letter , because he was out in Oregon , and if he had , he would have sent her the money . He would be getting it any day , sending her the money . Oh , God , make it come , bring him back , before it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great burden of proof which has already been accumulated by me , my associates and my lawyersas a necessity for clearing my name of charges against me that are totally unfounded . " " Who are your associates ? I want to know what I am doing . " " My partners . Lorry knows them . And , my dear girl , I might as well tell you now , I ca n't be pumped . " " Your game is to pump me . You do n't care what you would do , drag a decent girl 's name into the mire , anything . I suppose that that is business , " she said with heavy sarcasm . " Please , please , Miss O'Flaherty ! This is n't a game . This is a serious effort on my part to clear my name and my reputationof unproved accusations against me . " " I see . And you want me to become involved in muck as a betrayer . " " No , it is n't that . It is just that it might be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit to tell me things that you may know , and to find out further things that I may want to know . " " And ? " " You know , or if not , I shall tell you , Miss O'Flaherty , that this investigation is not going to drive me out of business . IP261may be of great use to you . I have watched you in your work , and I have spoken to Mr. Shevlin , the manager of the Union Hotel , and I know that you are a clever girl of extreme competenceand ability . Now I might find something for you to do in one of my organizations that would provide you with a greater future than you have at the hotel where you can not give full scope to your abilities as a young business woman , " he said , and Margaret resented the intonation of his voice when he used the word business . " And how much money do I get ? " " Well , that depends . You might get five hundred dollars and a better job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for spying on Mr. Robinson . " " Please , please , Miss O'Flaherty , do n't allow yourself the luxury of using such unfortunate words . " " Well , I like to call a spade a spade . When do I get the money ? Do I get it down now ? " " You would have to see my lawyers first . " " Mr. Brophy , you have had private detectives prying and sticking their nose into my private affairs , and you have done things to me that no decent self-respecting man would do to a girl . Having them following me around . Why , the very idea of it makes my stomach turn ! What kind of a man are you ? Have you no manhood in you to stoop to such depths ? " " Just a moment , girl ! Do n't be so rash ; I have not had any private detectives following you . I may or may not have certainagencies acquiring certain information about my enemies , and they may or may not have found out that my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is smoke , my girl , there is fire . " " I would n't stoop so low ! Not if it meant my life . " " Of course , that is a matter for you to decide at your own discretion . But I want to assure you again that you are going to be very unwise , very foolish , indeed , by being loyal to someone who ca n't win , and who , even if he does win , is not going to mean much to you . "   " So you know a lot ! Well , there is one thing I will tell you . I 'll tell you something that Mr. Robinson did say . He said that you 're a crook , and a lowdown dirty rat . I feel contaminatedeven sitting with you . You could n't bribe me ! You could n't buy me , not with all your dirty money , all your banks , not with every dollar you own ! So stick that in your pipe and smoke it . And what 's further , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I will tell what you said to me today . " " Walls have no ears , " he said , grinning as she arose and stamped out of the room in dudgeon . He shrugged his shoulders and followed her . Hastening out of the hotel , he saw a private detective picking up her trail . He smiled slyly . P263WELL , strike me dead if it is n't my beautiful darling sister , Peg ! I did n't know you were coming , I 'm so glad to see you , " Lizz said , pouncing on Peg as she let her in . " How are you , Lizz darling ? " Margaret said , submitting to an embrace and kiss from her unkempt sister . " And you look like such a beautiful lady . Say , I wish the neighbors could see you . It would just kill them . Can I run out and get Mrs. Koffinger and Mrs. Bodenheimer ? Why , they 'll never get over the sight of you . " " Please do n't . I 'm nervous , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said coldly . " I just wanted to show you off . I want them to see what kind of a family I have , " Lizz said , disappointed . " Some other time . I 'm nervous , " Margaret said while Lizz dusted off the upholstered parlor chair for her to sit in . " I 'm glad to see you , Peg . I 've been so sick , with my back aching me , and my neuralgia ! " Lizz said . " I know , you poor thing . I brought you this , " Margaret said , handing a five-dollar bill to her sister . " Oh , thanks , Peg , dear . I need it so badly . Dennis needs shoes , and I 'll have a mass said for Father out of it . " " Do n't be having masses said out of it . Use it on yourself and the children . The church and God do n't expect those that have n't got to give , " Margaret said impatiently . " You 're right . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother , and for all the children , and Jim and me . I just took one out for Catherine . They do n't cost much , only about ten cents a week for each policy . But IP264could n't pay the man last week . I can now . It 's so hard making ends meet . Jim does the best he can . He works long hard hours , the poor man , but he never makes over sixteen dollars a week , and by the time we buy food for the house , and pay the rent , and the insurance , and Jim pays his carfare to work , why , there is n't a penny left . " " How is Jim ? He is n't drinking again , is he ? He seemed very mean on the phone the other night , and I was afraid he and Al were going to fight . " " No , he took the pledge right after the little one was born , and he has n't broken it . The poor man was just worried about Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thinks the world of Al and Mother . And you ! Why , Peg , he says to me , Litz , nothing in the world is too good for your sister , Peg ! ' Oh , Peg , Jim just thinks the world of you , " Lizz said , getting up from her chair , gesturing and hopping around gaily as she talked . " How is Willie-boy ? I was so sad to hear he had been hurt . And you know , Al was walking right down the street when he was run over , but he had an appointment and he hurried on and did n't look . If Al had seen Willie-boy just a few seconds before the accident , it might not have happened . And Mother , she 's so broken up about it . She loves the ground that Willie-boy walks on . Next to Danny , he is her favorite . " " The poor boy , lying there alone in the hospital with his leg broken , and without his mother to take care of him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention ? " " Yes , but there 's no one to a child like his mother , no one in the whole wide world . And that will set him back a whole year in school . The sooner he graduates the sooner he can go to work and give his father a helping hand . " " I 'm going to try and bring Mother and Brother to see him Sunday . " " Oh , my William will be so happy . Last night , he said to me , almost with tears in his eyes , Mama , Mama , I want you to bring my brother Dan to see me . ' Oh , Peg , my William , P265he likes his brother Danny so much . But come and see your little niece , Catherine . She 's asleep , but we can peek at her . I gust got her to sleep . She has a cold and she was crying all morning . But she went to sleep like a lamb . I got the other children in the kitchen , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her up . " Lizz led Margaret to the bedroom , and they gazed down at the infant girl who slept , swaddled in old rags and blankets , her reddish face screwed up . " Is n't she her mother 's precious ? " Lizz whispered , a coo in her voice . " Lizz , all your children are such darlings ! " Margaret said when they went to the kitchen . " Hey , you kids , come and say hello to your beautiful auntie ! " Lizz said . " Oh , they are so sweet . You little dears , " Margaret exclaimed , looking at them , bending down to kiss each child in succession . " Look at your namesake ! You never would have thought , when you stood up for her in baptism , that she would grow into such a fine girl as she is , would you , Peg ? " Lizz said loudly , pointing at Little Margaret . " She 's a doll . And she 's almost as big as Daniel , " Margaret said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pronouncing the name possessively . " He 's such a sweet boy , Lizz . And Al adores him so ! He brought him home the cutest little pair of mittens and the darlingest stocking cap the other night , " Margaret said . " Here now , you kids , run in the parlor and let your aunt and mother talk . But do n't make any noise and wake your little sister up . She has a cold , and she has to sleep , " Lizz said . " Mama , can we have some cakes ? We 're hungry , " Little Margaret coaxed , giving her mother a dirty-faced grin . " Mother 's precious , they 'll make all of you sick . " " Gee ! " Little Margaret exclaimed sadly ; she sniffled.
