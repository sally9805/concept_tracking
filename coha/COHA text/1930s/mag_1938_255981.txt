In the national headquarters of the American Federation of Teachers in Chicago , President Jerome Davis last week tacked up a map of U. S. " intellectual slums . " The Federation had just finished a shocked inspection of the nation 's blighted school areas , where the generation growing up is getting little schooling or none at all . It found some 3,300,000 children of school age ( 5 to 17 ) not enrolled in any school , found even in relatively well-off Wisconsin 55,000 youngsters who get less than 90 days of schooling a year ( the U. S. norm is 200 days ) . Most squalid intellectual slums are in the South . Worst slum : Alabama , with only 59% of its children in school . <P> Cupboarded in Senate and House committees last week was the Harrison-Fletcher Bill , intended to wipe out the intellectual slums . The bill , which would appropriate $72,000,000 for Federal aid to education in the coming year and raise the ante to $202,000,000 by 1944 , embodies the recommendations of the President 's Advisory Committee on Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit Federal money to be used for books , bus service and scholarships for pupils in parochial ( e.g. , Roman Catholic ) schools , it is opposed by Catholicophobes , led by Columbia University 's Professor George Drayton Strayer . Meanwhile , to drive the bill out of the hostile House committee , the American Federation of Teachers and Progressive Education Association held a national conference in Washington , brought together college presidents , educators , Congressmen and 25 labor and farm organizations , which unanimously endorsed the bill . United in demanding its passage were A. F. of L. , C. I. O. , the railroad brotherhoods . Said A. F. Whitney , president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen : " The Harrison-Fletcher Bill is must legislation . "
