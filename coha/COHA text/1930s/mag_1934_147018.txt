With a great scraping of chairs and clearing of throats delegates to the League of Nations Disarmament Conference moved into their bleak hall in Geneva last week after seven months of recess . They and the world knew that they were mourners at a wake , that , with Germany absent and rampant on rearmament , the last chance of doing anything practical about engines of death went glimmering months ago . But they and the world expected a few fine fireworks before the corpse was laid finally to rest . That they got . <P> First speaker of importance was nasal , white-haired Norman Hezekiah Davis , U. S. Ambassador-at-large . His contribution to a world that already seemed twitching for another war : <P> " President Roosevelt has authorized me to summarize the attitude and policy of the United States as follows : <P> ' ' We are prepared to cooperate in every practicable way in efforts to secure a general disarmament agreement . . . . We are furthermore willing to negotiate a universal pact of non-aggression and to join with other nations in conferring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are a party . <P> " The United States will not , however , participate in European political negotiations and settlements , and will not make any commitment whatever to use its armed forces for the settlement of any dispute anywhere . In effect the policy of the United States is to keep out of war , and to help in every possible way to discourage war . We have no new cures to offer . " <P> Respectful applause followed Mr. Davis back to his seat . As far as the U. S. was concerned . Disarmament was evidently already in the grave . <P> Roly-poly Maxim Litvinoff , Soviet Foreign Commissar , next climbed the rostrum . In all previous Disarmament sessions , Comrade Litvinoff 's tactics have been to demand 100% disarmament at once , to pledge Russia to anything the other powers would agree to , and then to sit back and chuckle hugely as red waves of embarrassment flushed his capitalist friends ' cheeks . But things have changed in the past year . The growth of Hitlerism , formal recognition of U. S. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may soon take out a full League membership have left the capitalist world more sympathetic to Soviet officialdom than at any time in the past 15 years . Shrewd Comrade Litvinoff realized that this time it was necessary for him to do more than embarrass his disarmament colleagues for the benefit of the Moscow Press . He presented , therefore , two concrete proposals to jerk the delegates upright in their seats . <P> First he announced that , after years of dodging all responsibility for enforcing peace , Soviet Russia was now willing and waiting to join some system of enforced sanctions such as France has always cried for . Always eager to help , Comrade Litvinoff suggested that the sanctions be so graded that nations like France could be as forceful as they liked while others , like the U. S. , could be relieved of all military action . Comrade Litvinoff 's second suggestion was that the Disarmament Conference , already over two years old , be reorganized as a permanent body .                @ @ @ @ @
