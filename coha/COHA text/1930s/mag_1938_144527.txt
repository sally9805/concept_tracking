Intermittent , heavy spring rains last week put a damper on all large-scale attacks by both sides in Spain 's civil war . In the Pyrenees to the north snow turned mountain roads into slippery , slimy trails , prevented Rightist troops from making any appreciable gains . At week 's end <P> Rightist General Miguel Aranda , commanding the mud-sodden , zigzag line from Teruel to the Mediterranean , issued a " Fight , rain or no rain ! " order but Rightist troops inched forward only five miles to take the town of Portell before being halted . <P> Meanwhile , in Barcelona , Author-Correspondent Vincent Sheean took advantage of the lull to get off a few fresh observations on the 22-month-old war . Most striking thing about the war to Sheean , who reached Spain only two months ago , is its incongruous combination of ultra-modern and primitive methods . The ultramodern : " Newfangled bombs , thermite , delayed-action fuses and the like , which are capable of greater destruction than any bombs hitherto used in war . " The primitive : " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside Madrid . The ditches and ravines in these dusty clay hills take the place of trenches and are sometimes supplemented by small dugouts along their sides . There are no ordnance or survey maps at all-Spain has never been surveyed . The only maps available are the tourist road maps put out by the big French companies , Michelin and Taride . It is a terrible thing to see an artillery or infantry operation in open country being carried on by a man who is only able to feel his way by means of a crude tourist road map . The ' lines ' are very rough , there is no regular front at all . What you get is a number of concentrations at various points , with big gaps in between . " Three-quarters of the movements in the recent Leftist Aragn retreat took place " without the opposing infantrymen coming into contact at all , " observed Sheean . <P> The Leftists ' International Brigades , some of which lost three-fifths of their men and most of their officers in the Aragn retreat , are now reformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory , reported Sheean . The 15th Brigade , which includes the U. S. Lincoln-Washington battalion , the Canadian and British battalions , is now commanded by a Croat , Colonel Chopic . Its political commissar , John Gates , is a little soft-spoken union organizer from New York . " The Americans in the brigade are about 75% to 80% Communists-a much higher percentage than in other brigades . In the British and Canadian battalions the percentage of Communists is much lower . " U. S. volunteers are still carrying on in the Leftist medical service and U. S.-donated ambulances , bearing such inscriptions as To the Spanish Republic from the Workers of Barre and Montpelier , Vermont , are still chugging about behind the lines . <P> " My general impression , " concluded Sheean , " is that Italy and Germany will have to make a renewed effort , a further expenditure of men , money and material , if they hope to win this war . The resistance of the Spanish Leftist people is incalculable . The very babies raise their clenched fists in the air against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
