txt The five-cent levy on taxicab fares , recently imposed by the Board of Aldermen as part of Mayor O'Brien 's new revenue program , was declared illegal and void yesterday by Supreme Court Justice Albert Cohn of the Bronx . He granted a temporary injunction against its further collection by the city . This restraining order , it was indicated , will be filed and become effective in the next few days . Justice Cohn 's ruling , if not appealed , or if affirmed on appeal , will cut from the city 's estimated revenues for 1934 from $5,000,000 to $7,000,000 . This will necessitate further economies , additional revenues , or both , to bring into balance a budget which already faces a $24 , - 000,000 deficit . It will also make more certain than ever that the incoming Fusion administra:tion , headed by Mayor-elect F. H. LaGuardia , will make one of its first steps an appeal to the Legislature for permission to reopen the 1934 budget . Blow at O'Brien Program . Elimination of the taxicab impost will mark the almost complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fall by Mayor O'Brien , with the aid and counsel of Samuel Untermyer . In order to bring about the four-year financing compact with the banks the city was compelled to abandon the proposed emergency taxes on stock transfers , brokers ' profits and the profits of savings banks and insurance companies . The 50 per cent rise in water rates is now facing a strong repeal drive , and the emergency tax on profits of public utilities will be the subject of litigation in the State courts . Justice Cohn ruled that the tailcab impost was clearly a tax and not merely a license charged in the ordinary routine of regulating taxicab operation on public streets , It was therefore , he held , in direct violation of prohibitory sections of the State Vehicle and Traffic Law forbidding imposition or collection of taxes on owners or operators of motor vehicles by local authorities . " It is clear , " Justice Cohn held , " that the charge of 5 cents for each fare collected was intended for the purpose of producing revenue and not for the purpose diC regulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself strong evidence of that act .

The ordinance accordingly violates the prohibition against taxation by local authorities contained in Section 54 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law and is Illegal , null and void . " Justice Cohn 's opinion held that the ordinance was outside the scope of the blanket taxing power conferred upon the city by the special session of the Legislature last Sum-1 mer and could not be sustained on that ground . The litigation was begun soon after adoption of the ordinance , the suit being filed by the Beacon Transportation Company , Inc. ; the United Taxicab Board of Trade , Inc. , and Fannie Levine , a taxpayer . Justice Cohn found that the taxicab organization and the taxpayer had no standing , but up- ! held the right of the Beacon Trans-portation Company , which owns and operates taxicabs and is directly affected by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city would promptly appeal froml Justice Cohn 's decision . If the ap-1 peal should be unsuccessful , he said , the city would have to find new sources of revenue to replace the impost . Arthur T. W.

Other attorneys familiar with the laws governing taxicabs , however , were confident that Justice Cohn 's decision would s '  - -  Id . Mr. Untermyer disclaimed all responsibility for the taxicab ordi- nonce and added that he had never even been informed of the litigation before Justice Cohn . The entire matter , he said , was in the hands of Mr. Hilly . " I assume , " he declared , " that the Corporation Counsel will see that there is a stay of proceedings on the order until the case can be reviewed .

" Police Commissioner Bolan said that only a small sum had been collected by the Police Department since the ordinance went into effect on Oct. 1 and that the money would be held by the department pending a permanent disposition of the case . Justice Cohn 's decision was hailed as a joint triumph for the taxicab business and the public by Maurice Hotchner , former chairman of the defunct Board of Taxicab Control and counsel for the United Taxicab Board of Trade , Inc . Spokesmen for the city and the taxicab industry were rather vague , however , on the status of the taxicab rider during the pendency of Justice Cohn 's injunction . They hinted strongly that the rider would continue to be charged an extra five cents on the first " drop " of the taximeter . It would be expensiye and impracticable , they said , to have the meters recalibrated , and take the chance that reversal of Justice Cohn 's decision would force another expensive recalibration later on .

With the legality of the taxicab impost definitely denied by Justice Cohn , the city found its 50 per cent rise in water rates also facing cot.rt action . Supreme Court Justice M. Callahan , also of the Bronx , reserved decision on an application by Samuel L. Stolitzer , a. taxpayer , for an order compelling Mayor O'Brien to call the special session of the Board of Aldermen for which fifteen members recently petitioned . He asked the taxpayer and counsel for the city to file briefs . The avowed purpose of the special session is the repeal of the water rate increase .
