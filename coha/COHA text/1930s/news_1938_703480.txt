" - The witness , Joseph Mauro , boss stevedore and defendant in a perjury case for whom the alleged " fix " was to have been made upon payment of $100 , was not permitted to amplify his testimony and later counsel for both sides made statements for the record indicating that Mauro 's assertion would not warrant the lodging of charges against any one and might unnecessarily injure an innocent party . Motion Made for Dismissal After both sides had rested , defense counsel moved for dismissal on the ? ground that District Attorney William F. X. Geoghan of Brooklyn , who personally presented the case against his suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facie case of conspiracy and particularly had failed to establish the actual commission of any overt act by the defendants . The drama of the proceedings , in which Mr. Geoghan was prosecuting his friend and personal appointee , was heightened further when he opposed the dismissal motions and declared that it " and Murphy have not comitted any overt acts then I do n't know what an overt act is . " He stressed the fact that testimony had been offered placing one act of the alleged conspiracy in the prosecutor 's own office . Magistrate Vincent J. Sweeney then directed counsel to submit memoranda on the law involved by 2 P. M. Friday and announced that he would announce his decision at that time . He gave no indication as to how he would rule . The complaint against and Murphy is a misdemeanor and if they are held for trial they would normally go before three Special Sessions judges . However , former Magistrate Leo J. Healy , ? counsel for , has said , on several occasions that if his client were held he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County Court . The hearing , which started Monday , continued yesterday - with Mauro called for cross-examination . He reiterated his direct testimony in which he said he had given $100 to Murphy on . Murphy 's statement that would " take care " of a perjury charge against him . For nearly an hour Mr. Healy hammered away at Mauro in an effort to force an admission that Mauro had " fixed " other cases and had initiated the alleged " fix " in the present case . Mauro obviously was irked at Mr. Healy 's questions and suddenly shouted : " Yes , I intended to fix the case and so did Murphy . He mentioned other names . I do n't want to mention other people in this case . It would just be other dirt . " " What other people are in this case ? " demanded Mr. Healy . " If there are other people , " Mr. Geoghan interposed , " I also want to know them . I want it all on the record . " " Other people , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge . A District Attorney . Or anybody . Please call Police Inspector . I 'll talk to him . " Inspector , who has been handling the case for the Police Department , stepped up to the bench and there followed a verbal clash among Mr. Geoghan , Mr. Healy and the Court . yr . Geoghan said he wanted " the greatest publicity " given to Mauro 's testimony " if this is the proper place for it . " After further argument , Mr. Geoghan objected to Mauro continuing his testimony along this line . Magistrate Sweeney sustained the objection , declaring that he had the " utmost confidence " in Mr. Geoghan and . Inspector to " properly handle this- matter . " He held that Mauro 's testimony along this line " would not help in spelling out the guilt or innocence of the defendants on trial . " Mr. Healy then asked Mauro if he intended to accuse a city magistrate in the case on trial . Mauro refused to answer . " Why wo n't you answer ? " Mr. Healy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mauro . " Is n't It a fact that you would accuse a magistrate or a district attorney if you thought you could save yourself ? " Mr. Healy asked . " I refuse to answer , " the witness replied . Luncheon Conference Held After a luncheon adjournment , Mr. Geoghan said for the record that he had conferred with Inspector and . Mauro about the reference to a " judge and district attorney . " " The witness was reluctant on the matter , " Mr. Geoghan declared . " Inspector knows what is in his mind . I will put the name mentioned in the record if the defense so desires , but there is nothing upon which I can base a charge if it is brought out . " Mr. Healy , smiling , said he was " satisfied the name has nothing to do with this case " and saw no reason to put it in the record . The rest of the session was taken up with playing in court a phonograph device that had . recorded . telephone conversations between Mauro in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Brooklyn while the case was being investigated . Defense counsel then made their dismissal motions , holding that under the law there could be no conspiracy without an overt act and that there had been no actual " fix " to show a separate and distinct overt act . Mr. Healy argued that at best a charge of extortion or larceny could be made against Murphy for allegedly accepting $100 from . Mauro . Mr. Geoghan contended that Mauro 's testimony that he had been assured by in the District Attorney 's office that " everything was all right " was a " very , very serious overt act . " He also declared that 's " counseling and helping a man charged with a crime " was an overt act .
