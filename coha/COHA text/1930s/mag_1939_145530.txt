Nobody in Chile has ever taken the five year-old Nacista party very seriously except the Nacistas . The Nacistas take everything seriously . Last week the Nacista Congress at Santiago was very grave about a serious mistake everybody ( except the Nacistas ) had made for a long time-namely , confusing the word Nacista with the word Nazi . The latter , they said has horrid meanings ; Nacista has the most innocent root in the world- " birth . " <P> Apparently the whole thing was a mistake from the beginning . Chile 's party , said the Congress , was not in the least like Germany 's . True , one of the three Nacista members of the Chamber of Deputies is part German . Admittedly , the party supported storm troops . There was no denying that members occasionally wore greyish-brown shirts and overseas caps . Indeed , they did go about saluting each other with raised arms . Sometimes it is a fact , they drilled . Yes , they once took to the streets to fight the Communists . No good Nacista would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bare possibility that the word Nacista was derived from the party 's original full name , Movimiento Nacional Socialista . Nazi came from National Socialist Party . <P> But no , said the Congress , the whole thing was a mistake . Chile 's party was as unlike Germany 's as a sickle is unlike a swastika . The world must remember that 15,000 Nacistas helped elect Chile 's Popular Front President Pedro Aguirre Cerda last October . Henceforth the party name was to be Popular Socialist Vanguard . It would advocate : 1 ) nationalization of copper , nitrate , iron industries , electricity , railroads ( all but the last largely U. S.-owned ) ; 2 ) creation of a State-owned bank and merchant marine ; 3 ) housing for Chile 's underpaid workers . Having thus clarified a world-wide misunderstanding-all based on the meaning of one little word-the newly born Vanguardians heaved a serious sigh and adjourned .
