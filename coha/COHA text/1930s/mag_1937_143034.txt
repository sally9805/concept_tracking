THE FILIBUSTER-Laurence Greene- Bobbs-Merrill ( $3.50 ) . <P> On Oct. 16 , 1853 , from San Francisco , a small , freckled , poker-faced , soft-spoken Tennessean named William Walker , 29 years old , sailed with 45 assorted killers , down-and-outers and adventurers to capture Lower California as the first step in privately annexing Mexico and Central <P> America to the U. S. In the next seven years before he faced a ' Honduran firing squad , William Walker hoisted his own flag over " the independent Republic of Lower Californi , " got himself elected President of Nicaragua , was involved in a fight with ten countries , became No. i U. S. soldier of fortune , alternately a hero , a joke and a villain . Told this week in The Filibuster , his story fills 350 large pages with an adventure story as absorbing , fast-moving and as incredible as any so far dug out of that period of sleazy brigandage below the Rio Grande . <P> Effeminate , bookish , a graduate of the University of Nashville at 14 , William Walker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29 . In that year , having absorbed as much as he could hold of the expansionist propaganda then parading as the " manifest destiny ' ' of the U. S. , he decided to colonize the Mexican state of Sonora . Short of men and food , still shorter on experience , the expedition lasted through seven months of skirmishes , mutinies , desertions , marauding and general futility . Relieved to get out alive , Walker limped across the U. S. border with 34 survivors , surrendered to U. S. authorities . On trial in San Francisco for violation of the neutrality laws , Walker lied that he had intended no harm , won a prompt acquittal from a jury reflecting the public 's readiness to wink at his kind . <P> Back on a newspaper , his boss , an enthusiast named Byron Cole , sold him on the idea of taking over Nicaragua . A fat prize , it turned out to be too fat-Walker had to meet competition from the feasting eyes of England , Spain , the U. S. , the more glittering eye of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicaragua . The deal by which Walker evaded U. S. neutrality laws provided that the Nicaraguan " Democrats " . invite him to send in " colonists . " By the time the " Democrat " leaders realized what Walker was up to , it was too late to regret having asked him in . On the military side , Walker was unbeatable . Augmented by a steady flow of recruits from the U. S. ( who received free transportation on Vanderbilt boats ) , he soon appointed himself commander in chief of the Nicaraguan army . Had his judgment been half as good as his luck he might have ruled a long time .
