A prime indicator of better business lately is a waning interest in day-to-day Washington news , a rising interest in Business itself . Most U. S. businessmen still damn the New Deal as freely as ever-but not in impotent rage . Less than a year ago they were hysterically predicting the doom of the profit system . Now they ease their minds with forthright opposition to White House policies , count on the courts to sustain their objections and devote more thought to making and selling goods . But the most soothing influence on jittery business nerves has been profits . <P> Last week the Wall Street Journal tabulated statements of the first 25 U. S. corporations to report for the June quarter , found aggregate profits up 7% from the same three months of 1934 . The gain for the six-month period was almost precisely the same . For a slightly smaller group which had published comparable reports in the past , June quarter profits were 40% above 1933 , 102% above 1932 , but still below 1931 . No major steel companies had reported by last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly sampled . <P> Typical earnings : Johns-Manville , thriving on a mounting volume of residential building construction , reported profits of $798,000 for the first six months of 1935 as against $173,000 in the 1934 half . <P> Schenley Distillers ' June quarter was better than a year ago but profits for the half-year were down $1,200,000 to $3,000,000 . Reason : Schenley 's liquor sales were abnormally high in the first few months of 1934 , following Repeal . <P> Caterpillar Tractor , now the No. 1 maker of Diesel engines in the U. S. , has been a big beneficiary of the New Deal . Rising farm income and PWA expenditures , particularly for road building , boosted sales from $13,000,000 in the first half of 1934 to $18,700,000 this year . Profits for the half were up from $2,000,000 to $2,900,000 . <P> Owens-Illinois Glass , No. 1 bottle-maker in the U. S. , always reports for the previous twelve months like a public utility , not by quarters or halves .

Official explanation for the 50% decline in earnings was a cut in French and German banana quotas . Another reason was supposed to be appropriation of heavy reserves against possible losses on foreign accounts , principally German . <P> General Electric 's first half profits of $11,500,000 amounted to 40 for each of its 28,800,000 shares outstanding . That compared with $9,400,000 profits in the same period last year . Orders for the first six months of 1935 were up 13% to $104,000,000 . <P> National Biscuit 's profits for the first half were reduced by labor troubles , processing taxes and higher prices for grains .
