On the platform at the commencement exercises of Jesuit University of Detroit last week a grizzled oldster nervously adjusted his hood . As the name Adam Denhardt was called , he stepped up to become a Master of Arts . What made Master of Arts Denhardt remarkable was not his age ( 64 ) but the fact that so far as could be determined he is the first public school janitor in the U. S. to earn a graduate degree . <P> Interviewed by newshawks in his office at the Winterhalter School , Janitor Denhardt calmly displayed his two caps ( one with a special officer 's badge for directing traffic ) , a tin lunch bucket , a neat list of his day 's duties beginning " Faucets to be repaired , " a pile of English and German books . No ordinary janitor , Adam Denhardt was a German teacher for 33 years until he was pensioned off in 1924 . When he and his wife Agate went to the U. S. , leaving their three daughters behind , the only job he could get was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German Orphan Home . A school janitor for the past eleven years , old Mr. Denhardt began studying nights at the University of Detroit three years ago . He wrote his thesis , in French , on Victor Hugo et la Nature . <P> Before going back to work , scholarly Janitor Denhardt observed : " I am unhappy unless I am busy . ... I started to study theology once , but I dropped it . I now have no faith . The existing faiths , they do not convince me , though I would like to believe . ... I have no political opinions either . I was a member of the Provincial Legislature in Germany once . Then after the War there . was . . . violence and beatings and I could not stand seeing that . I would never be interested in politics again . It is not civilized . "
