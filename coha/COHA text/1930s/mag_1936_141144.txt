A tiny , forgotten participant in the Italo-Ethiopian War was the British freighter Santa Maria whose job it was to carry from Finland to French Somaliland two tons of TNT , 200 incendiary bombs , three airplanes and four machine guns for Emperor Haile Selassie 's armies . The Santa Maria had got as far as Gibraltar when Haile Selassie fled his empire and the war was over . Captain P. P. Allen was told by the cargo 's Finnish shippers , who had presumably already been paid for it , to land it somewhere and await further orders . He landed it at Tangier in Morocco 's International Zone . Before he could get his ship away , the port authorities ordered him to reload his perilous consignment and get it out of Tangier in a hurry . <P> Thereupon Captain Allen made for London , but news of the two tons of TNT had preceded him , and at Gravesend he was told that the Santa Maria was not wanted . Desperate now , he put in at Guernsey , one of the Channel Islands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islands ' Royal Court into passing a special ordinance against him . The Santa Maria lolloped around Land 's End to autonomous Lundy Island in the Bristol Channel , but the British Home Office bestirred itself to forbid Captain Allen to unload . <P> Last week Belgium was added to the countries that considered the Santa Maria 's load a hot potato . The freighter headed south , supposedly bound for Arabia and China . But the shippers had been busy . The Santa Maria turned about , met a Belgian barge on the high seas , unloaded TNT and incendiary bombs and then , with only a few innocent planes and machine guns , once more sailed up the Thames and put in at East London 's Silvertown . Once more Captain Allen pleaded his case in vain before London port authorities , left for Spain with a cargo of sugar .
