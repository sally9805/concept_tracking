Reunion ( Twentieth Century-Fox ) is the second instalment of the fictionized " Biography of the Dionne Quintuplets . " In the first chapter , The Country Doctor ( TIME , March 16 ) , the famed Five were the most important characters in the story . <P> In Reunion they are incidental . Chaperoned by their amiable nurse ( Dorothy Peterson ) , for eight of the picture 's 80 minutes they waddle about with normal two-year-old awkwardness and silence , blowing horns , tumbling over cribs , pounding a piano , guzzling milk and sucking thumbs in the familiar quinsome way . For the rest of the show they might just as well not have been born . <P> This is because their role is only that of five guests at a get-together in Moosetown , Canada , of the 3,000 people whom Dr. Luke ( Jean Hersholt ) has brought into the world . The occasion is supposed to be a great party for his honor and enjoyment . Actually , it becomes almost as great a drain on his resources as a Mr. Fix-It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an obstetrician . In one afternoon he finds himself obliged , as mentor for the 3,000 , to : 1 ) succor a suicidal cinemactress , 2 ) trick a U. S. Governor into adopting a child , 3 ) bring his assistant and his nurse together , 4 ) save an old friend from losing his young wife . All this leaves the audience with renewed conviction that sequels are rarely as good as the first instalment . <P> Love on the Run ( Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ) . Sally ( Joan Crawford ) is a fabulously rich U. S. heiress engaged to Igor ( Ivan Lebedeff ) , fabulously torpid European fortune hunter . She leaves him waiting at the church to run off with Michael ( Clark Gable ) , fabulously adroit U. S. reporter . After junketing in Europe by airplane , delivery truck and wheelbarrow , they spend a night in the palace at Fontainebleau . Michael then tells Sally simultaneously that 1 ) he loves her and 2 ) he has been using their escapade to make headlines in the U. S. Sally takes up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael follows her , effects a reconciliation . Rash Sally falls into the clutches of two international spies who have been shadowing her since Reel 1 . Brave Michael rescues her . <P> If the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ever presents a prize for the picture which best exemplifies all the faults and all the virtues of all the pictures made in any given year , Love on the Run should win it . From the first word in its title to the last shot on the screen , of Crawford kissing Gable , it represents a kind of bright , composite photograph which , for historians , might be labeled Mass Entertainment 1936 . Important only to historians , the median 1936 cinema should please the average 1936 cinemaddict . Average shot : Franchot Tone telling Joan Crawford a knock-knock : " Machiavelli good suit for $10 . " <P> Lloyd 's of London ( Twentieth Century-Fox ) . In The House of Rothschild ( 1934 ) , Producer Darryl Zanuck imparted to a waiting world the news that the Battle of Waterloo was won by George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same Wahoo , Neb. authority on the Napoleonic Wars reveals the inside story of Trafalgar . England 's victory in this case , it appears , sprang from a childish pact between Admiral Horatio Nelson and Jonathan Blake , the moving spirit of Lloyd 's , London 's famed insurance company .
