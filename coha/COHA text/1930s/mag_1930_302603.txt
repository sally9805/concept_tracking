Few U. S. families are so steeped in tradition as the Barrymores , whose eighth theatrical generation consists of John , Lionel and Ethel ( the onetime Mrs. Russell Griswold Colt ) . One part of the Barrymore code is that to any member appearing in a Manhattan premiere , another member sends not a basket of roses , but a big red apple . This autumn Ethel Barrymore has been gallantly struggling for big red apples-some for herself and some for her daughter Ethel Barrymore Colt , 19 , who is making the ninth generation 's debut with her mother in Scarlet Sister Mary . <P> Ethel Barrymore has had trying times before . Fitted by appearance and temperament to play drawing room drama , almost every time she has attempted something more pretentious she has met with a setback , e. g. : The Shadow ( 1915 ) , Rose Bernd ( 1922 ) , Romeo &; Juliet ( 1922 ) , The Kingdom of God ( 1928 ) . Even a Barrymore can fail , critics remembered , when Scarlet Sister Mary opened in Columbus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week the closest she had gotten to Manhattan was Washington . <P> Audiences in Columbus were not particularly warm toward the play . Adapted from Julia Peterkin 's Pulitzer prizewinning novel , its first drawback was that the dialog was in Gullah. * And Actress Barrymore 's facial expressions , under cork , were hard to see , especially since the sets were made too dark . But Actress Barrymore was not downhearted . She had the kind of a part which is every actor 's dream : when she was not holding the stage all the other actors were talking about her . <P> Her role was that of Sister Mary ( Si May-e ) , a noble , impetuous Negress whose first husband leaves her for his side woman within a year of their marriage . After that she becomes notoriously promiscuous , tenderly raises a brood of illegitimate children . After 20 years her husband , whom she has never ceased to love , returns . Sister Mary scorns him . Then her firstborn , Unex ( so named because he was unexpectedly born in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the curtain falls , Sister Mary finally makes known her contrition . Ethel Barrymore Colt , as one of Sister Mary 's daughters , makes four appearances , speaks a few lines in the last act . <P> From Columbus the piece journeyed to Cleveland , to Pittsburgh , to Washington where it again swung into the Western circuit under playdoctors ' orders . Meanwhile it was receiving either awed accolades because Actress Barrymore was in it , or courteous , unimpressed reviews . It was clear that it was not yet fit for the big time and Actress Barrymore repeatedly refused to have her picture taken in blackface . This was probably due to the fact that she was fussing with her makeup , making it lighter and lighter , going from minstrel-show black to high brown . Also , the dialog was being freed from much of its unintelligible verbiage . <P> From Cincinnati the play moved to St. Louis . Here an enterprising cameraman from International News Service slipped into the theatre to get Actress Barrymore 's picture . He was caught , thrown out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered , evicted . In Minneapolis no attempt was made , but last fortnight at Detroit a Candid Camera clicked twice , one clear photograph resulted ( see cut ) .
