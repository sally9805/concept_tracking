txt ELECTION ' OF SENATORS . Advocate of Amendment Later Regretted Its Adoption . To the Editor . of The New York Timea : I have just read with much interest what you have to say about the selection of candidates for United States Senator by primaries and their , " popular " election . It is fast coming to the point when it will be so difficult for any other than a very wealthy person to be elected Senator that a majority in that body will have bought their - way in . Surely that will not be to the public welfare . I Can . tell you ' that the majority have reached the conclusion of John M. Stahl , who got us farmers the delivery of mail and did so much for the modern parcel post and good roads . I have just been reading his " Growing With the West , " recently published , and in it he gives the letter from him that Representative Rucker , who had charge of the final House . debate on the amendment changing the method of electing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read when that final three hours ' debate was opened  --  a mark of distinction not often accorded a letter from one who insisted on remaining a private citizen . Mr. Stahl was an able advocate of the amendment , but in his autobiography he says : " I think this part of my public activity would better never have come to pass . The election of Senators is really further from the control of the people than it was before . The expense of the primary elections are no small addition to the tax burden of the people . The expenses of the candidates in the campaign for nomination and election have been multiplied . The tendency is to limit the nominations to men of wealth or those who will put themselves under criminal obligations to procure funds considered necessary to success . Certainly the personnel of the Senate has not been improved . The men who framed the Constitution of the United States were men of very unusual , it might be said of superhuman , wisdom . They produced a wonderful charter for a republic : a Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution should have our veneration and we should regard it with that aversion to change that must come from a right appreciation of its merits . " Many will endorse every word of that . The amendment that should be canceled is not the last one ; at the least , it is not the one that should have the first consideration . Away down here in Florida we have not as yet the direct interest in this subject that Pennsylvania and Illinois and other States have , but the Senate has a big share in legislating for all of us . We are all concerned in its character . CHARLES G. SPAULDING . De Land . Fla. , May 29 , 1930 . AN ENGLISHMAN PROTESTS . Deprecates Plan to Locate Airport and Ranges Near West Point . To the Editor of The Neu+ York Times : From papers which have reached me from the United States I understand that under Hamilton Fish 's bill , now under consideration by Congress , it is proposed to expropriate the owners of the property south and west of West Point , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land east of the main road to West Point , and further to create an artillery and machine-gun range in this area . This part of the Hudson River is , if I may say so as a foreigner , one of the most beautiful bits of the Hudson , namely , that stretch of the river from Anthony 's Nose to West Point . Although it is true that the property on both sides belongs to private persons , in a sense it belongs to the nation , as it is one of the beauty spots of the country , for thousands of people who travel up the Hudson in the Spring , Summer and Fall take delight in viewing this most lovely stretch of the river . If the proposed airport is made on this most unsuitable site , which of course can be done with great expenditure , it will mean that the whole of this part of the Hudson will be ruined , either for habitation , or , on the other hand , from a scenic point of view . The trees will have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley , which is narrow here , will reverberate with the sounds of " horridum helium . " All I can say is , that to destroy a beauty spot in order to create artillery and machine-gun ranges and an airport seems to me , as an outside observer , to be an act of vandalism . Some years ago it was proposed to locate Sing Sing prison near Fort Montgomery , a proposal which fortunately did not come to fruition . There is plenty of land away from the river which could be obtained at probably less expense and which could be used for the purpose desired without ruining one of the most attractive parts of your country , teeming as it is with historical interest . MARTIN ARCHER-SHEE . London , May 21 , 1930 . Poor Rendition of Lincoln Speech . To the Editor of The New York Times : Today again many people in various parts of the country recited Lincoln 's Speech at Gettysburg , and probably with few , if any , exceptions every rendition was executed in a drab monotone . At least such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the many repetitions of the speech that have been broadcast since the advent of radio . Some years ago I had an Edison wax cylinder record of the speech , by Len Spencer . The rendition was superb , and nothing I have heard since has even remotely approached it . I understand that Len Spencer is dead , but I often wonder whether there is not still in existence somewhere one of those old records and an old phonograph . If there is , it would be to the advantage of every orator who wishes to recite the speech to use Spencer as a guide for expression . Better still , perhaps , would be the broadcasting of the record itself . The full dramatic intensity of Lincoln 's masterpiece can not be conveyed without proper x epression . EDWIN E. TAIBEIL Freeport , N. Y. , May 30 , 1930 . BROOKLYN 'S MARINE PARK . Work Would Relieve Unemployment and the City Should Act . To the Editor of The New York Times : I read with considerable interes% THE TIMER editorial on the Regional Plan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island , because at this time in Brooklyn we are trying to interest the Board of Estimate in. providing substantial funds for the development of Marine Park , a tract of more than 1,500 acres , which the city has owned for several years , Part of this land wax donated by ; Messrs . Pratt and White . On ad south it fronts on Jamaica Bay and Rockaway Inlet . It includes nun/ Island , which could easily accome modate one-half million bathers , Through its centre runs Gerritsen Basin , a wide and deep waterway* and . there are other streams within its borders . It already has better transports .. tion facilities , with respect to the whole city , than the Staten Island , tract , and it will have perfect transit when Mr Delaney builds the Nom trend Avenue subway extension and the Utica Avenue subway , on both ot which hearings were held before thi , Board of Transportation this Spring , To date about $215,000 has been ap . propriated toward its developments and less than $25,000 of this has beers spent . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from subway excavations at low cost for filling purposes . It will be two years before this material can be secured , and it will fill an acreage of only about one-half of 1 per cent of the total Marine Park area . The city has been rather delinquent in furthering this project and niggardly with its appropriations . I have before me pledges from two of Brooklyn 's most substantial builders that they will build homes to the value of $2,500,000 this year if the city will make a substantial appropriation toward the development of the park . Within two years , there would arise homes to the value of at least $10,000,000 around the park , were the city to show a sincere interest in its development . The amount of work created by such building operations would certainly help our existing unemployment situation . The people of Brooklyn could begin to enjoy a splendid waterfront park and the city would receive taxes from newly created values in the surrounding area .

Sheepshead Bay , N. Y. , May 29 , 1930 . SWISS VIEW OF TARIFF , Ill-Will Toward Us Certain to Result if Bill Is Passed . To the Editor of The New York Times : At the beginning of May the Federation of Swiss Watchmakers appsaled to me to do what I could regarding the pending American tariff bill , in view of my position as an American-born importer of American merchandise , and president and . founder , since 1915 , of the women 's movement , entitled the " World Union of Women for International Concord , " as well as in view of the service that I was able to render to this country during the war by instigating the Swiss wheat mission to America . You are one of the ninety prominent and influential people to whom I addressed myself in this grave crisis . You will be interested to know that the most practical result of my campaign has been the combined action of the automobile manufacturers in America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and present it to the proper government authorities . Your exceptional understanding of the interdependence of international trade and its relation to the peace of the world makes it almost unnecessary to point out the dangerous repercussion in Europe of the tariff bill , against which thirty-eight nations have protested violently . The indignation against the proposed tariff has done more to advance the idea of an economic United States of Europe than could , perhaps , have been accomplished in a generation . M. Briand 's plan will , undoubtedly , be of great benefit to European peace , but when European manufacturers can buy and sell freely in a larger market than the United States does now at home , and will be able to increase production proportionately , with infinitely cheaper and more skilled labor , the exports from the United States  --  loaded with carrying charges and duties  --  will certainly find themselves handicapped in a solid , united , eventually freetrade Europe . Aside from the economic features of this question , it is impossible to overstate the ill-will and hatred engendered by the proposed tariff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to follow if the bill is passed . CLARA GUTHRIE d'ARCIS . Geneva , Switzerland , May 21 , 1930 . Saluting the Flag . TO the Editor of The New York Times : I have net marched in a New York parade for some , ears , so was greatly impressed yesterday with the almost universal eecognition of the colors . This in spite of the unusual frequency with which they passed . One felt it was real tribute and not because some one was looking . Small children saluted , old ladies stood up , foreign-looking men raised their hats . One could spot old soldiers as they drew themselves to attention or if uncovered by the wistful look in their eyes , thinking of old days and old units now disbanded . Then , too , one was impressed by the universal red of the poppy . Not only was there good salesmenship , but there was true memory of those who live beyond . SAMUEL T. STEWART .
