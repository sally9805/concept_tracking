txt Editorial Correspondence . Tire NEW YoRx ' harms . SAN FRANCISCO , Calif. , Dec. 21 . ? Faced with the necessity of raising at least $90,000,000 additional revenue by taxation during the next two years , California bids a long farewell to Utopian schemes and searches for the least painful way of getting the money to pay for its present commitments . The cost of State government for the 1935-37 biennium will be at least $225,000,000 , not counting a deficit already existing . And to meet this bill there is an estimated income of $135,000,000 , taking into account all existing forms of State taxes . Californians already are paying a sales tax of 2 , A per cent . It has been intensely unpopular , yet one of the current proposals is to raise the rate to 3 per cent instead of reducing it next July 1 to 2 per cent , as promised by the law that originally levied the tax , passed by the Legislature of 1933 . Another proposal is to levy a State income tax of one-third of the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A proposed State ad valorem tax would raise $65,000,000 . But the idea is unpopular with owners of real property , already burdened by local taxes . The State is next year relinquishing a gross revenue percentage tax on public utilities corporations which has been yielding about $70,000,000 per biennium . Under a new law ratified by the voters at a State-wide election , public utility property will be returned to the counties for local taxation on the same basis as all other property . Governor Merriam and the Legislature probably would favor a referendum to the people at a special election next Spring retaining the gross revenue percentage tax on utilities for at least two years more , were it not that an initiative measure repealing the sales tax and substituting a modified single-tax scheme has qualified for the ballot at the next election . The Governor and his advisers fear that the single-tax scheme would be adopted because of being linked with repeal of the unpopular sales tax . How to Pay the Problem . At any rate , the fiscal and tax problem of California will revolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not about utopian schemes of the kind suggested by Upton Sinclair . The San Francisco and Los Angeles Chambers of Commerce have come out formally against a State income tax , which Governor Merriam has favored . But the discussion will be on a basis of accommodation , compromise and expediency . Upton Sinclair 's EPIC will be represented in the lower house of the Legislature by only eighteen Assemblymen , chiefly from Los Angeles , and the entire EPIC mbvement is in practical collapse as a force in practical politics . So-called progressivism will demonstrate itself in the next Legislature if at all in the demand of labor groups and the League of Women Voters for an unemployment insurance bill . A joint legislative committee appointed at the last session will bring in a bill providing for joint contributions by employers and employes , and the League of Women Voters had drawn up a similar bill providing that employers pay 3 per cent of payrolls into the insurance fund and employes 1 per cent . Enactment of some unemployment insurance bill is regarded as almost certain . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compulsory health insurance , and it will get at least qualified support from a special committee appointed by the California Medical Association at its convention at Riverside last Spring . The appointment of this committee was in itself a victory for the faction in the association that believes in health insurance , and its members are inclined to favor some form of insurance . The committee has spent $30,000 of association funds in making a survey of 35,000 California families , and has been aided also by workers assigned to the survey by the State Emergency Relief Administration . Merriam Disappoints . Governor Merriam has continued to talk in what are called progressive terms , and to date the criticism of him by those who voted for him only to defeat Sinclair centres upon his discharging of old State employes and replacing them with political favorites of the orthodox political type . He has been attacked by the League of Women Voters and by the State Park Commission for resorting to spoils politics , and he has stirred up a hornet 's nest among veterans by attempting to replace J. P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs and chairman of the veterans ' welfare board . Mr. Brennan has administered $50,000,000 of bond money in loans to veterans for buying or building homes and ranches without losing a penny of the State 's money . Delinquencies are less than the difference between the 5 per cent interest paid for State money by veterans and the less than 4 per cent paid by the State in interest on its veterans ' bonds . Governor Merriam has attempted to discharge Brennan and to replace him with Thomas Foley of San Francisco , who had charge of the veterans ' end of his campaign . Mr. Brennan is taking the question of his status to the courts and has the support of the veterans ' board if not of the majority of veterans . On the - whole California is beginning to decide that miracles do not happen very often and that Mr. Merriam will run true to form as an old-fashioned politician who is too old to change his ways . The prospect is for a shrewdly managed administration of accommodation and compromise .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
