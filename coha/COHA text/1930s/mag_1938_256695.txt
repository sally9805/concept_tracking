Defense Program <P> Sirs : The melancholy happenings of the last week give point to the old saying , " self-preservation is the first law of nature . " Since our statesmen may be as confused as those of other democratic powers may I appeal to you to bring the following seven-point defense program to their attention : <P> 1 ) Immediate expansion of appropriations for defense needs to $3,000,000,000 per annum . <P> 2 ) Construction of a navy powerful enough to defend both coasts at once against attack by any coalition of powers . <P> 3 ) Construction of an air force superior to that of any foreign power . <P> 4 ) Construction of necessary military roads ; mechanization of the land forces ; and organization of adequate air defense for all major cities . <P> 5 ) Institution of compulsory military service : one year in the labor corps ( 18-19 ) ; two years in active service ; 25 years in the reserve . <P> 6 ) Immediate suppression of all hyphenated organizations . Members of such organizations as are treasonable shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Gradual rectification of national frontiers to include within the U. S. all territory from Alaska to Panama . <P> Let us not be satisfied with half-measures . Obviously there is only room for one major power on each continent . <P> HOWARD R. ANDERSON Cornell University Ithaca , N. Y. <P> <P> White Paper <P> Sirs : TIME 's recent essay-of-the-week on Assistant Secretary of War Johnson contained a reference to the army 's sinister " White Paper " relating to the suppression of civil insurrection in this country . Just a fortnight later TIME notes the relation of the transfer of air force headquarters into the Chicago area to " White Paper " detail . <P> What 's in the wind to occasion recurring comment on the contingency of internal disorder here ? Do the 1940 elections bear an ominous look ? Are all democracies expected to go on a jag every generation or so ? Do Viewers-with-Alarm expect Federal finances to go haywire ? Failing to have his way with the Supreme Court , the Executive Department and now the Senate , is the President expected to resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nazis suspected of a plan to sabotage American aid to France and England when Der Tag arrives ? . . . <P> TIME always talks hard and fast . If anything is brewing and TIME knows it , let 's hear about it . <P> BOB RIDGEWAY Los Angeles , Calif . <P> &gt; Officially , the U. S. Army ventures no guesses as to cause or place of any civil uprising . Obviously , however , any plan to use the army assumes a defense of Government from forces threatening Government . Obviously , too , any such threat to Government would be most likely in time of general economic collapse. - ED . <P> <P> Ski to Perkins <P> Sirs : Will you tell us something of the life and affairs of Madam Perkins ? We are hearing repeatedly that she is of Russian parentage , born in Russia , her name changed from a ski to Perkins when she arrived in this country . Her marriage license is said to indicate that both she and Mr. Wilson were mill workers . . . . <P> LAURA CHAPIN Alameda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
