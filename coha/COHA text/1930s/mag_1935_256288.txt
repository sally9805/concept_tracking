Twice during the past three weeks , Trenton , N. J. 's old , spired First Presbyterian Church became an ecclesiastical courtroom . Pious partisans for prosecution and defense filled its pews . The Moderator of the Presbytery sat as judge on the bench , gaveled lustily when spectators laughed . Counsel bickered , wrangled , thumbed through the Presbyterian Book of Discipline to decide niggling points of procedure . And in the church sat a man accused , indicted and liable to be rebuked , suspended or excommunicated . <P> The defendant was Philadelphia 's Rev. Dr. John Gresham Machen , who for months had been volubly telling how Presbyterian Modernists were persecuting him and other Presbyterian " Bible-believers " ( TIME , Dec. 31 ) . The indictment , brought against him by the New Brunswick Presbytery which still claims his allegiance , was a six-point elaboration of the fact that he had defied his Church 's orders to resign from the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions . The trial was limited by the Book of Discipline to one session every ten days . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Machen , who from the beginning was disposed to cry " Star Chamber ! " <P> First session resulted in Dr. Machen , through counsel , challenging all seven members of the commission trying him . He accused them either of prejudging his case or of being his enemies or , if laymen , of being influenced against him by their pastors . <P> Second session , last week , saw one of Defendant Machen 's challenges granted but the commission ruled that there was to be no discussion of doctrine-to which Dr. Machen as a Fundamentalist is highly devoted . Testimony revealed that although the defendant claims he belongs to the Philadelphia Presbytery , the New Brunswick Presbytery has never been so notified and regards him as its own .
