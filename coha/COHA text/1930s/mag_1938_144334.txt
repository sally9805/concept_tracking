White- Viking ( $2.75 ) . <P> Nearly 20 years ago Sinclair Lewis , Theodore Dreiser , Sherwood Anderson and a score of lesser authors made their reputations by dramatizing the deadly influence of Main Street 's narrow , inhibited middle-class culture . What has been happening on Main Street in the last hardbreathing decade of boom and depression ? The single serious attempt to find out has been Robert &; Helen Lynd 's brilliant sociological study , Middle town in Transition ( TIME , April 19 ) . On the surface , reported the Lynds , the cultural pattern of Main Street in 1935 appeared to be intact . But the pattern showed significant new bulges . <P> Last week What People Said , a 614-page , dramatic first novel , laid in imaginary Athena , Oklarada. offered the first work of fiction to tempt comparison with Middletown in Transition . On the surface Author White 's Main Street still looks much as it did in Main Street and Babbitt . Like Sinclair Lewis .

But Author White 's novel carries an undercurrent , nowhere found in Lewis ' books , of those acute undersurface tensions detected by the Lynds . <P> Main characters of What People Said are drawn from two of Athena 's leading families . Idealistic Charles Aldington Carrough is a famed country editor and Progressive . His closest friend is persuasive , charming Banker Isaac Norssex . Their sons share the family friendship . Lee Norssex goes into his father 's bank .

It is the end of his career , but only half of What People Said . The rest of the story unfolds the scope of Lee 's crookedness , which runs like a sulphurous fuse from Banker Norssex to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , it sputters just as stinkingly in the homes of the suddenly " unbearably honest " Oklaradans , since they tolerate a society that breeds embezzlers and hypocrites , as it breeds the unemployed who snarl so ominously in Athena 's ears . But such talk is only between Junior and his wife . Publicly they hold their tongues , not wishing to wreck the paper . <P> When the Norssex case breaks , Editor Carrough is in the Orient . Junior is relieved because he imagines his father , if he had been in Athena , would have stuck his neck out to defend his old friend . But when Editor Carrough returns , and is asked to use his personal influence to lighten old man Norssex ' stiff sentence , he keeps his neck as firmly in his collar as any other Athena businessman .
