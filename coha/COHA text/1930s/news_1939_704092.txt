txt The grand jury which has been investigating charges of graft at Louisiana State University since the resignation as president of Dr. James Monroe Smith and his flight to Canada , brought in twenty-eight true bills just before 6 o'clock this afternoon . Twenty-three of them were against Dr. Smith and two named one of the close friends of the late Senator Huey P. Long , Dr. Clarence Lorio , State Senator , president of the Louisiana Medical Society , head physician at Louisiana State University and political boss of this parish . Dr. Smith already is in jail under $50,000 bond on an earlier indictment charging him with the embezzlement of $100,000 , which he is accused of borrowing from a local bank with a bogus authorization from the board of supervisors . The other indictments returned today were against E. N. Jackson , business manager for L. S. U. , and George Caldwell , the 300-pound construction superintendent , who received a 2 per cent commission on building costs at the university and is under $10,000 bail on a Federal warrant charging him with diverting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Federal Work Progress Administration . Bench Warrants Ordered Judge Charles A. Holcombe , a pipe clenched between his teeth , ordered bench warrants issued for all the defendants except Dr. Smith . Two indictments accused Caldwell , who lives in a house with goldplated bathroom fixtures , of embezzlement .. Another accused Caldwell and Dr. Lorio , who was one of the physicians in attendance on Huey Long when he lay dying of an assassin 's bullet in September , 1935 , of embezzlement . It was reported that university material worth $240 was involved . Dr. Lorio was indicted separately also for " receiving and having embezzled goods " in his possession , while Jackson was accused in separate indictments for embezzlement and receiving embezzled goods . The indictments against Dr. Smith , whose resignation preceded that of former Governor Richard W. Leche by twenty-four hours , charged him with forgery and the falsification and altering of public records . The sum of money involved in the various forms of forgery attributed to the man who was snatched from obscurity by Huey Long and placed at the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as tough as an elephant 's , " amounts to nearly $1,000 , - 000 . Governor Earl K. Long and his Attorney General , David M. Ellison , insist . however , that the State is not out a dime and that the banks are " holding the bag " to the tune of $500,000 . The grand jurors accused Dr. Smith of falsifying the minutes of the university Board of Supervisors on several occasions . He was charged with faking a resolution which raised his salary from $12,000 to $18,000 a year , of forging a resolution asserting that his speculation on the wheat market was for the benefit of a non-existent university endowment fund and with certifying falsely that the board had authorized him to borrow $500,000 from banks here and in New Orleans . Indictments charged him also with manufacturing minutes of the Board of Supervisors raising Jackson 's salary and allowing Caldwell a two per cent rake-off on the cost of buildings which with WPA and PWA help have sprung up like mushrooms on the campus since 1936 . Other indictments charged the former head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oscar Kallen , who died in January , 1936 , and of another State official who also is dead , to two unauthorized bond issues totaling about $500,000 . New indictments against Dr. Smith had been expected and it was reported that others connected with the university might be involved . The indictment against Dr. Lorio , who was a supporter of Huey Long years before this oncehostile parish was won over to the heirs of the " Kingfish " in the era of good feeling which followed the election of Mr. Leche , came as a bombshell to this troubled capital . Dr. Lorio is both rich and powerful , and while the charge against him involves only a petty sum of money in comparison with Dr. Smith 's large-scale peculations , the fact that he was indicted at all created a sensation . Dr. Lorio , besides the per diem he receives when the State Senate is in session , is on three payrolls of the State . He receives $6,000 a year as medical director of the university , $2,400 as visiting physician at the Greenwell Springs Tuberculosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penitentiary . Friends of the parish boss rallied round with offers of property and cash for his bail bond when he was arrested . Among them were Joe Bates , chief of police , and A. H. Harelson , president of the police jury or selectmen of the parish , which meets tomorrow to consider a ? grand jury request for $5,000 to pay the salaries of special investigators . Court Room Is Tense The court room was tense and comfortably well-filled when the grand jurors reported . An hour before they filed into the court room they had asked District Attorney Sanchez to leave the room and had gone into executive session . Clyde Strait , the foreman , handed a thick bunch of indictments to Judge Holcombe , who , after glancing at them , passed them to the clerk . District Judge W. D. Womack , a ' member of the Board of Supervisors , who presided at the investigation which Huey Long held here into a plot against his own life , was an interested spectator alongside the bench . Dr. Lorio who was in the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centering around Dr. Smith 's stewardship at the university surrendered to Sheriff Newman H. De Bretton . Judge Holcombe said he supposed Mr. De Bretton wanted " the pleasure " of locking up Dr. Lorio , but the Sheriff said it was " not a pleasure but a duty . " Before deputy sheriffs started for the homes of Caldwell and Jackson , they telephoned that they would come in and surrender voluntarily , which they did . All three were fingerprinted . Meanwhile in New Orleans , District Attorney Charles A. Byrne made public parts of a fifty-two page statement , in which J. M. Brown , who served as intermediary between Dr. Smith and his brokers , Fenner &; Beane , aserted that the funds of the educator were mingled with those of various contractors and officials of the university , in one trading account carried in the code name of J. Monroe . Those named by Brown as sources of cash or collateral for Dr. Smith were Leon C. Weiss , the architect who designed many of the university buildings ; Caldwell , Jackson , T. P. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Hart Enterprises Electric Company . In addition , Brown 's statement said that on Nov. 1 , 1938 , Dr. Smith handed him Orleans Levee District refunding 5 per cent bonds with a par value of $50,000 and told his intermediary to deposit them to his account with Fenner &; Beane . Brown said that Dr. Smith told him the bonds belonged to Caldwell Brothers &; Hart , a contracting firm in which Monte Hart and Verne and Summa Caldwell have an interest and which received many contracts for L. S. U. buildings . The bonds were withdrawn Nov. 22 from Fenner &; Beane and were returned to Caldwell Brothers &; Hart on Nov. 22 , 1938 , Brown said in his statement to the New Orleans prosecutor . Brown , who has been indicted by the East Baton Rouge grand jury on a charge of aiding Dr. Smith in embezzling $100,000 , also told Mr. Byrne that on June 14 , 1938 , Dr. Smith gave him a cashier 's check of the National Bank of Commerce , payable to Leon C. Weiss in the sum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fenner &; Beane . Before that Brown said Dr. Smith had told him that some of the bonds of the university which he had pledged as collateral , belonged to George Caldwell . On March 2 , 1938 , Brown 's statement said , a check drawn by the Hart Enterprise Electric Company to 0 . W. Ware , Dr. Smith 's son-inlaw , was deposited to the credit of the former university president 's trading account . Says Smith Kept Own Records A check for $2,500 made out by " Red " Heard found its way into Smith 's trading account Nov. 3 , 1937 , Brown disclosed , adding that he once asked the educator if he did not want the various funds segregated , but that Smith told him that he would keep his own records to cover the interests of his associates . Smith insisted , Brown said , that all funds should be carried under his code name in one or the other of the twelve special accounts he carried . Brown said that Smith at one time took out insurance to protect his associates in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the statement , the educator gave Brown a five-year contract under which the intermediary was to receive 20 per cent and Smith 80 per cent of profits they might realize . Prior to the filing of the report of the grand jury , it subpoenaed the correspondents of The New Orleans Item-Tribune and THE NEW YORK TIMES . The grand jury recessed for the week-end after filing the latest batch of indictments and District Attorney Sanchez asserted that its work was still far from finished . Former Governor Leche and several other high State officials have been subpoenaed to appear Monday .
