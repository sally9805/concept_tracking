D. H. LAWRENCE &; SUSAN HIS COW-William York Tindall - Columbia ( $2.75 ) . <P> Lawrence and his worshiping women is a thoroughly exploited subject ; Lawrence and his worshipful cow is a new one . The cow , Susan , browsed in the backyard at Taos , N. M. , and was regarded by Lawrence with genuine devotion . " The queer cowy mystery of her , " he wrote , " is her changeless cowy desirableness . " William York Tindall , a 36-year-old professor with a razor wit , has read everything that Lawrence wrote , everything ( so far as possible ) that he read , and everything written about him , simply to trace the path that led Lawrence to this love . The result falls into that class of scholarly production in which acuteness and smugness fight a draw . <P> Tindall 's researches found that Lawrence 's materials came not only from his constantly anguished experience but from a whole raft of undigested philosophy , anthropology , occultism . The fashionable gibber of Madame Blavatsky from Tibet , the yoga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Om , " said Lawrence ) , the Bergsonian view that all was flux , the Freudian unconscious , the Jungian libido , many studies of primitive culture were all skimmed by Lawrence for his private religion . By the time he got to Susan , says Scholar Tindall with no particular depth , deep called to deep .
