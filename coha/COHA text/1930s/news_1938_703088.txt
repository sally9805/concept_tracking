Mr. Pittman shouted : " Drive me there ! " Dunn demurred . It was too far and he did n't have enough gasoline . Thereupon Mr. Pittman , who lives at 4549 Drexel boulevard , kicked the meter clear out of the cab . This made the cab driver so angry that he took the loving couple directly to the Central police station and told his troubles to Desk Sergeant William Kells . Marriage in a Hurry . " This gentleman and this lady , " he said , " got into my cab at State and Lake . They said they wanted to get married . The lady said to hurry up .

Please let him out ; he 'll never be in this mood again . " But the sergeant said the only way to get Mr. Pittman out was to fur . nish $200 bonds . And again Mrs. Shumway wept
