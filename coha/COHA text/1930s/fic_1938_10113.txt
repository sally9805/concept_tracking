And Tell of Timeknowing that , he still loved her as he had loved nothing on earth but Mary . A perfect child . ' It seemed to him , then , that he spoke because he could no longer help it . Miss Lettie , ' he heard himself saying as he rose and stood beside her , I would be proud and honored to have you marry me . ' It was out at last . Over her head , William 's face loomed , startled into immobility . Do you know what you are saying , Philip ? ' he demanded , sharply . I 'm asking her to marry me , William , ' Philip responded quietly . Just what you heard me say . ' Letitia took no notice of their conversation ; if she heard it , it seemed to make no impression on her. jumping Jehosopha t ! ' exploded William , glaring at his cousin , and falling ba ( k on an expletive that he was apt to use under stress .

Too true . But need that matter to her ? ' he inquired reasonably . She is not in love with rte ; 1 ant in love with her , ' he explained . It 's the truth , William , ' he added , meeting his cousin 's incredulousgaze . Letitia stirred against William 's shoulder , and raising her face , she looked straight at Philip . He said that he thought he had loved her once . He would n't deny it . He said that would be like denying he loved me now . ' She was silent , but they could see she was repeating his words to herself , that she had not finished what she had to say . Suddenly she moved over to Philip and , standing straight and still in front of him , with her hands clasped tightly together , And Tell of Time 141replied to the proposal that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tomorrow , ' she told Philip in a clear , dead voice , and , turning , went rapidly into the house . William sat down abruptly and studied Philip 's face . You must be crazy , ' he said , gazing intently at his cousin , entirely crazy , but I believe you are telling the truth . I never knew you to do otherwise , ' he admitted . He was puzzled and irritable , as people and ants become when they do not know how to get around obstacles suddenly set up in the path they wish to follow . Philip stood with his hand on one of the posts supporting the steep overhanging balcony . He could just catch the murmur of the river flowing over the twisted cypress roots that deflected its current and caused it , ever so often , even to shift its bed . He felt old , remote , and , suddenly , extremely weary ; yet he was more at peace than he had been for many a day . The die was cast , at any rate ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his desires would necessarily determine the outcome . Such a state of mind would have been impossible for Povey , a younger man , to summon . Of course , ' William went on firmly , she did n't mean it , and if she did , I would n't expect you to take advantage of ' her excitement . She 's upset now ; she 'll think differently in the morning . ' He stood up , deeply perturbed by the turn his plans had taken . Go on home , Philip , ' he said , studying his cousin 's face . We are all tired and worked up . This ca n't he settled tonight  --  you 'll see how foolish the whole thing is in the morning . Go to bed . That 's best . If you stay , were both apt to say something we 'll regret later on . ' Without moving , Philip answered . II is back was still to William , and he spoke almost as if he were dreaming , his words142 And Tell of Timedropping from his lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William . I 'd better go home , ' he assented . They 'll both think better of it , overnight . I expect Povey 'll be over before daybreak . ' He smiled a slow , reminiscent smile ; then he swung around abruptly facing his cousin with an expression that William recognized . In their boyhood when he had noticed Philip 's eyes narrow , and harden , as t hey now did , he had learned there was never any use arguing further . Listen and mark what I say , though , William . If she is willing to stand by what she said , nothing on God 's earth can prevent me from marrying her . ' Suddenly , he put out his hand and shook William 's spur frame vigorously . It 's absurd ; of course it 's absurd . I know it . We 're both a couple of doddering old idiots . They 'll be certain to make it up tomorrow . Good night . I 'll take your advice and go to bed . ' William sighed in relief , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he said urgently ; ' go , while you 're talking sense . ' Philip mounted his horse and rode homeward . When had he felt such lethargy and utter fatigue as now overtook him ? Such dead and desperate certainty that there was no longer any use either to hope or to grieve . As he was drifting off to sleep , he remembered twice in his life when he had felt like this : the day Mary died , and the clay he heard General Lee had surrendered . He did not open his eyes until the sun was well up in the sky . His servant , Matt , was standing by his bed , touching him lightly . ' Dar 's a young lady outside , suh , ' he was saying apologetically . She tell me she hatter see you , right straight away , and cai n't wait . ' Philip was instantly awake . He reached out for the cup ofAnd Tell of Time 14.3black coffee in Matt 's other hand , thinking at once that some of his patients had taken a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saucer to cool , he hastily drew on his clothes . It 's probably the Miller child , ' he decided . Lockjaw , too , I 'm afraid . I suspected it yesterday . ' He lifted his saddlebags , where bottles neatly labelled in Latin rested in small leather pockets . Then , picking up his surgical case , he checked over its contents carefully , counting his instruments one by one , lifting them in their clean white cases . Looking at his watch , he saw it had been less than ten minutes since Matt had called him ; and then he stepped out onto the gallery through the long window from his bedroom . Sitting on his horse with the October night shutting him in , Philip watched , without moving , the light now falling from that window . Remembering the morning , seven years ago , when he had passed through it to find Letitia waiting outside for him , he felt again the metal handle of his instrument case cutting into his hand as he saw her ; felt again the weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though it were this minute in time , the way her hair had glistened in the sunlight as he had bent over her , at first incredulous and then , suddenly , caught up in the strange , exciting sense of everlasting youth that always possessed him whenever he came near her . ' Letitia ! ' he remembered he had asked her instantly . ' William did n't let you come alone ? ' ' I got off before anybody else was awake , ' she replied , waving the question impatiently aside , and hurrying on to what occupied her thoughts . ' I saw you did n't think I knew what I was saying last night , ' she told him , as her breathing quickened . ' I came over to tell you I did mean it . I 'll marry you today , if you want me to  --  144 And Tell of Timetoday , ' she repeated . Her voice , to Philip 's ears , sounded unnaturallytense and excited , like a sleep-walker 's . At the recollection of that moment Philip sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stir in the saddle , picked up his feet to move on to the warm stall and mash that lay , he knew , in the stable ahead . Philip checked him absently . Not yet , boy ; not yet , ' he said aloud , rubbing Pilot 's shining , arched neck , the muscles of ' which broke , under his touch , into a curious rippling mot ion . Philip stared off over his horse 's head , his eyes recording , not the night shadows that now lay thick upon the gallery in front of Letitia 's window , but how-her face had looked as the light fell upon it that n i t n i ug seven years ago . Even yet he could feel her body relax like a child 's against his as he caught her and held her , fi ) r the first time , in his arms . What would ally net o have done ? ' he asked himself fiercely now , as the 1.11Iing leav e began to swirl around him in the rising wind . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did . Never a day since then that I have not loved her more ! ' he thought passionately , wishing that he might see her shadow moving across the light . The light in the window went out . She has taken it in to see whether the children are covered , ' he hazarded , watching the now darkened room with bright , intent eyes . That 's it , ' his attention automatically registered , as the light reappeared in the window . As though there had been no interruption in his thought , his mind went back to the day they were married . I to had ordered his trap hitched up at once ; he remembered that now , and they had set off immediately to Berryville , the county scat , to obtain a license and a minister . He knew , then , And Tell of Time 145as he knew now , that what he was doing was rash , impudent , and preposterous ; but , even with all that had happened since in mind , he admitted , as his eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that even now he would do the same , that he had not had the strength in him to resist , would not have it now . He remembered that they had hardly spoken , all the way to the village . A frenzy of excitement had possessed him ; they could not get there quickly enough to suit him ; he was hardly aware of the unbroken silence into which Letitia had sunk . After they had secured the license , the clerk offered his surprisedcongratulations and remarked : I suppose you 're looking for Bishop Gregg , Doctor . He 's just been in , asking the way out to your place . ' The Bishop ? ' Philip echoed in astonishment . Where is he ? Which way did he go ? I did n't know he had left South Carolina , yet . ' Well , he 's here , ' the clerk beamed , pleased to be the bearer of good news . He said he was going to baptize somebody 's baby . Let me see , now , whose was it ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his thought . Could n't have been Jim Greene 's ; no , they 're Baptists . NI ust have been the Briscoe baby  --  they 're in town today . ' Yes ! yes ! ' Philip had answered hurriedly . It seemed to him a good omen that the Bishop , whose salary he lent of 1i-red to help guarantee , should have chosen this day , of ' all days , to arrive in the county . For the moment the anxiety that underlay his excitement was stilled . I 'll just look in here , ' he said to Letitia , as they passed by their small white church , with a gleaming cross above it . There 's a chance . ' She nodded , holding out her hand for the reins , but said nothing. 146 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 147He met Bishop Gregg at the door , with Mr. and Mrs. Briscoe , whose land joined Philip 's , on its western edge . He smiled and bowed to them and took a peep at their baby boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renounced for him the vain pomp and glory of this world and all covetous desires . Then he turned to the Bishop . I 'm Philip Darcy , ' said Philip , cordially holding out his hand . It 's good to have you here . We 've been at loose ends in this state . I wish I 'd known you were coming so soon , ' he apologized . We 'd have met you , of course . ' From a glance , he knew what manner of man he was addressing . Just what we expected , ' he meditated , taking in the Bishop 's thoughtful eyes , set a little unevenly in his head , his head of thick hair brushed off his fine brow and then combed around his eas ; his lips set somewhat aslant , like his eyes , in a face distinguished by the reserve of a scholar and the resolve of a man who has , once and fin- all , put his own desires aside . I am glad to be here , ' the Bishop replied and looked keenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Philip smiled . ' A good many . I did n't dare to hope you 'd leave Cheraw . A l ) eawrtilitl place , as I remember it , ' he said sincerely . It took me a while to decide , ' the Bishop admitted . The opportunity at Sewanee interested me profoundly . ' For a moment his gaze was abstracted , as if his mind were still torn . Then a warm flashing smile lit rap his reticent face , and he turned to Philip with the expression of a man who has burnt his bridges behind him . I see now , ' he said , his glance meeting Philip 's , why you wrote as you did . The Church has an opportunity to win an Empire here  - -  -  an Empire . ' He stood watching Philip , his meditative gray eyes bent , not on him but on a kingdom like that which the abbot , Augustine , foresaw , whenhe first knelt on English soil , with his monks bowing in a long line behind him . Philip was conscious that Letitia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. and Mrs. Briscoe were standing in the doorway anxious to get started home . He saw that he must make his desires known at once . I 'm doubly glad you 've come today , ' Philip remarked , and threw a glance in the direction of the baby 's parents ; and I hope that Mr. and Mrs. Briscoe will consent to stay and act as witnesses . ' Witnesses ? ' The Bishop raised his eyebrows and smiled pleasantly at Philip , waiting for an explanation . We want you to marry us , ' Philip said simply . Miss Letitia FitzHugh and me . ' Mr. and Mrs. Briscoe could not conceal their surprise , but Philip refused to recognize it , and , taking the Bishop 's arm , led him down to meet Letitia . He seemed startled by her youth . My dear child , ' he began , taking her by the hand , and glancing doubtfully back and forth between her and Philip . The gold cross against his black cloth glistened in the sun , and Letitia watched it with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Then she roused herself and , stepping down on the ground , looked straight up into the Bishop 's face . He saw then that she was not quite the child he had taken her to be . Taking the license that Philip offered him , he examined it closely , making up his mind . There was probably mote to this than he knew , he reflected . He studied them both carefully and decided on his course . They were not people whose intentions you could easily suspect ; and this was the man who had first invited him out to Texas . Come in , ' he told them , and God bless you both . ' 148 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 149 At sunset they drove up to William 's house , Philip remem- bered , forcing his thoughts relentlessly back through the day that he had married Letitia . Povey was on the gallery , seated beside William . Letitia walked straight up to him , not waiting for Philip . She did n't quail , ' Philip thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the strange combination of gentleness and courage that dwelt side by side in her . And she has n't since , ' Philip admitted ; ' not once . ' He could hear her low voice now . ' Povey , ' she had said clearly  --  Philip remembered her exact accent  --  ' I told you last night I would never marry you . I have just married I ) octor Darcy , and , if God will help me , I am going to he it good wife to him . ' William 's Dice registered the surge of anger that seized him , as he hurried to meet P h i l i p . I t was a long time , Philip recol- lected , belbre he and William had resumed their old association  --  not till ; thee the I1inS , Felicia and Letitia , were born , and he had come Lack limn S.o , ; innah with Cavin , just before the war broke out . ' I do n't blame him ; I did n't blame him then , ' Philip re- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if it were happening under his eyes , how Povey , hearing what Letitia said , had jumped to his feet , throwing a sudden horrified glance at her . It was enough to tell hint that what she said was true , past undoing . God help us all ! ' he had cried out , and had flung himself on his horse . One day in the army when Philip was operating on a man without chloroii , nn , he suddenly remembered how Povey had looked that night when he brushed past William 's outstretched hand . ' As fir as I know , ' Philip thought , since then she has never spoken to him , nor he to her . ' He corrected himself . ' I know they have never met . But all the time , all the time , I look at her and know it will never be any different . He 's back , now . I hoped  --  God forgive me , it 's true  --  I hoped he would die in prison . What do I care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehemently . What does anything matter ? ' There flashed into his mind the old saying that all men succeedin killing what they love the most . It 's true , ' he thought . God ! How pitifully true . Why are we made as we are ? ' It was not the first time Philip had asked himself that question . Never a day that I have not regretted that I married hoer , ' he added grimly , never a day that I have not acknowledged my mistake . For her sake '  --  he corrected himself  --  for her sake only . ' He wondered if she had ever heard what William had told him  --  how before Povey 's letter could have reached his fiancee in Fredericksburg , he had received one from her announcingthat she , like Povey , had mistaken her youthful infatuation for something more lasting . She was marrying another man , she wrote Povey , in a month . If Letitia knew , she had never revealed her knowledge . But Philip had recalled the fact many times . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ezpericni r and his training caused him always to admit to himself , ' I had no business marrying her  --  none on earth . ' His stun lace grew gentle as he thought of the years he had had with her , years broken by the war and by his knowledge that Letitia was , in a sense , as much a stranger to him as on the day he had met her . When he saw the twins , in their crib beside their mother , he had had a hope  --  how vain it was he had soon realized  --  that they would rouse Letitia from the apathy that had taken150 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 1 5 1increasing hold of her since the full realization of her actions had swept in upon her . Not that she has n't always done her full duty by them and by Cavin and me , ' Philip admitted to himself . She loves the children  --  too much so , I sometimes think . FitzHugh has been a constant care to her , too , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think what holds him back . ' For the moment , his mind wandered to the baffling illnessof his youngest child , FitzHugh , now almost three , who had been born after Philip had returned to the army with the wound healed that had sent him home , quite early in the war , on leave . FitzHugh had always been a delicate child , finicky and exacting . Letitia had been tireless in her care of him , but Philip knew what it had cost her to bring him to this age . How on earth did she manage , ' he thought , with a sick child and a plauctation to rim ? And a war going on besides ! It 's a good thing , ' he meditated , that our overseer had only one leg and could n't go iii the army . ' For a moment his mind wandered to this man , Dennis Giles , whose leg had been so badly mangled in his youth by an infuriated alligator that it had had to be cut off at the knee . Even so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the county . ' He thought of him kindly and regretfully , and wished that he had been able to save his life when , in the middle of the past summer , he had suddenly fallen in the fields , seized with aheartstroke . Since then , Philip had tried to manage alone . He gathered his thoughts together , and resolutely swung them back to the problem that faced him and never let him rest . Inexorably , he forced himself to go over again the circumstancesthat were never quite out of his thoughts . He felt that he could not bear to go home with his mind as unsettled and torn as it had become these last few weeks . Great God ! ' he cried aloud in the dark , falling into the languagehe had taken to using in the army . Am I willing to let her pay for my happiness ? ' As he spoke the blood seemed to run out of his heart , and an actual physical weakness shook him , like an ague , in the saddle . Relentlessly , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must decide , and soon , ' he groaned . But how ? ' He was back at the old impasse that the war had not settled . His jaws clamped together as he recalled the events of the past few months . In August , William had met Philip and , after some hesitation , had informed him that Povey was back , released from prison , and , for the time being , until he was stronger , was living at Holly Grove . Until then , after his own return from South Carolina , where he had been invalided during the last months of the war , Philip had not allowed himself to think of Povey . Since then , he told himself , he had thought of little else . It had been a week now since the day he had sought out William in his cotton fields . How does he feel about it ? ' he asked his cousin abruptlywhen , after some search , he came upon him . William was dlhis horse , testing out the fibre of the white fluff in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he replied absently , giant ing up . The damned negroes say they have to have a contract now . What 's going to happen , Philip ? ' He looked up , and what Philip had asked him at last penetrated through his own depression . It required only one glance at Philip 's farce fin- William to understand the implications of the sudden question put to him . He knew his cousin too well either to evade his inquiry or to try to soften his own reply. 152 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 153 I do n't know , Philip . He 's never mentioned her name to me , ' he answered quietly , not once since that night . ' He saw that Philip knew instantly to what night he referred . Laying his hand on his cousin 's saddlehorn , William 's hesitant voice went on . But I think I ought to tell you . I have a note for her from him , to be delivered if I survive him . ' William 's eyes searched Philip 's face anxiously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaze clinging to a lone tree some distance away in the field . There are six forks to that branch , ' he counted . Six . ' Endlessly he went over the number : Six forks ; one , two , three , four , five , six . Count again . Yes , that 's right  --  six . ' Once , in his training period , he had encountered a patient who had incessantly counted his lingers aloud , only ceasing when he slept . All at once Philip recalled the man 's face ; he had not thought of it in forty years . With an immense cflort , lie dragged his eyes down to meet William 's . II is tongue was dry , and his voice sounded strange to him , as lie opened his mouth . ' There are the children . ' Yes , I know . ' My God , William , what must I do ? ' The words seemed to take visible shape and float before him . What can I do ? ' he asked ; and again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was repeating the question . He had been sitting so long on his horse watching the light in Letitia 's room that one entire leg was asleep . He moved it impatiently , slapping it until the circulation began again to saddle , he recalled how William had le a eked off over the field of cotton that morning , studying his reply . At last he raised his hand off the saddlehorn and laid it on PhiIip 's arm . I ca n't answer that question , Philip . God knows I 've tried to often enough . ' Philip knew now , as he sat in the dark , meditating his course that ever since that day he had known what he had to do , that there was nothing else , indeed , that he could do . Longer than that , ' he admitted the truth . Since the day I married her , I 've known . ' Suddenly he took a deep breath , and straightening his shoulders , gathered up the reins and put Pilot to a gallop . Right now , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through it all again . ' Pilot jumped clear off the road , startled by the spurs that so seldom touched his coal-black sides . Philip threw the reins to Matt , who , hearing the horse 's hooves , had come out with a lantern to take Pilot to his stall . Hurrying up the steps , he entered the house and hung his saddlebags on a low chair that always stood beside the door . He had his hand on the doorknob to his right when Letitia turned it and , passing out , held up her finger , pointing to the room across the hall . All asleep , ' she said . Then she glanced at his face . You 've had no supper ? ' she asked . And you 're tired . Sit there by the fire , ' she said , motioning to a room at the end of the hall where a lamp was burning . I thought , when the norther blew up , you 'd be chilly . I 'll have something brought in . ' He paid no attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he gave no sign of having heard them . Letitia was moving off to summon the cook , when Philip reached out and drew her into his arms , cradling her there . His eyes roved over her face , examining it intently ; he pushed her soft154 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 155 hair back off her forehead , and touched it lightly with his lips . You 've a beautiful brow , Lettie , ' he told her . The first time I saw you , I noticed it . ' It was the first time he had spoken since he came in . Is that what you stopped me to say ? ' she asked him lightly , I should think He interrupted her . No. ' lie drew a breath , and hurried on . No , I stopped you to say that I intend to give you the children and your freedom . You know Povey is back ? ' he added quietly . It was over , now . Would he feel like this the rest of his life ? Sixty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms were still around her . He could feel her stiffen , till it seemed as if she had no breath . Her eyes stared up into his face , her own de%Oid OI ' expression , and her lips , which were slightly open , whitened , but did not move . He was afraid to speak , as he watched her . Suddenly , Fitr.111101 awoke and began to cry in a loud , terri- lied wail , as if elre raring . The sound aroused Letitia , and she tried to draw herself together . Sit down , darling , ' Philip persuaded her . I 'll go . ' They had been standing beside a large chair , covered with red calico and padded with cuslriom . Philip remembered , as he had looked at it , that the first time Letitia had entered the door as his wife she had dropped into it , exhausted . Sit there , ' he told her , motioning toward the chair . She shook her head and leaned against him for a moment , trying to control the trembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chill . Come , ' she said ; he may be running a fever again . ' Together they went in to the child , soothing him back to sleep . A night lamp burned on the table beside the bed filling the room with a gray , cheerless light . Philip took up Fitz- Hugh 's little hand and felt his pulse carefully , timing it with his excited breathing . ' Just starting in the world as I 'm leaving it , ' he thought , Strange that I should have a child this age . ' Nothing wrong , ' he said aloud , in relief ; studying the child 's face . Letitia had been rearranging the covers on l " itzUugh 's bed . Now she raised herself and , putting one hand out to the bedpost , stood silent , satisfying herself that he was asleep , Philip marvelled at her composure ; he felt his own slipping from him , and started out of the room . Philip ! ' Letitia 's voice recalled him . He took a step backward , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fi , r whatever he was to hear . It seemed to him that , as he waited , time splintered into fragments and reassembled again bcfi ) re his eyes . Letitia 's face , however , was calm and drained of feeling . Seeing her , Philip recalled a group of young nuns he had once met on the street in New Orleans . He had never forgotten their young eyes , so clear and childlike , under their flaring headdresses . They too had renounced joy before ever they had tasted it , he thought now . Letitia looked past him , seemingly occupied with some knowledgeor purpose that he did not share . At last she spokc quietly , as if what she had to say was of no special importance . Philip , I must tell you . In the spring , we are going to have another child . ' He stared at her , startled into immobility . Could it 1w true ? He knew , as he looked at her , that it was . A phrase that he had lingered over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drum in his brain . What gods rule human destiny ? What gods ? What gods ? ' Ile repeated the words with no room in his mind for any other thought , feeling vaguely that , so long as he permitted nothing else to enter his156 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 157consciousness , he might ward off the pain that already he felt pushing against the thin barrier thus erected between it and him . Letitia turned toward him , with a sudden rush of pity . She wanted to tell him what she had already learned , what he was never to learn : how to build up around the core of his soul a region that would be numb , impervious to agony  --  impervious because hope and desire had already passed out of it . But as she reached her hand to touch him , she knew that he would never walk on that road with her . As long as he was alive , he could not  --  would not  --  cease to struggle , or cease to wrestle with pain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could she tell him all this ? And if ' she could , how was he to understand , without the kno led , ti c increasing his own despair ? One thing she could tell him , though . Laying her hands lightly on his cheeks , she stood watching him , it seemed to him hours , before her lips opened . ' I ' 11 never leave you , Philip , never while I live , ' she said at last . He drew a sudden breath and dropped his arms around her , conscious that a st conger bond than young romantic love united them , for they were drawn together by a proud and common spirit that scorned to grovel before the chances of life . Each loved the other , in that rnonrent , not as lovers , but , Philip suddenly thought , for the reason that God must love mankind  --  because they were poor , blind human beings set down in a world of mystery and confronted by questions that they could never hope to answer . There in the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a long desert march , and each drew from the presence of the other a strength that sustained and comforted them both . I low long they stood there , they never knew ; but at lastLetitia stirred . Come , ' she said to Philip gently , as one urges an invalid who is recovering to take up his accustomed round of life again . Come and get your supper . ' Yes , ' Philip answered . Yes , of course . ' But he did not move . Then she felt his muscles slowly growing tense , and his shoulders resuming their usual firm carriage . Stooping , he kissed her long and tenderly and stood at last erect . Yes , my dear ; yes , of course , ' he said again , more distinctly , and followed her to the fire , where a pot was bubbling on the coals which had been dragged out on the red hearth from beneath the blazing logs . When do you expect Cavin ? ' she asked him , trying to make her tone casual , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot biscuits . And Tell of Time 159Chapter8 j1  --  I ' WAS September 26 , and a fine clear day . For almost the first time since the Mary Frances had put out from Savannah , she moved easily through long , gentle swells with the grace fill nH et ion that sail boats always appear to have in pictures . But most of the  --  way the little vessel had pitched and rolled in heavy waves stirred up by the edge of an equinox- ial storm into whir le she had run . The first day out , the wind was high , blowing not in gusts , but with an ilk reast Iir. ; steady fierce which pressed the sea almost as flat on top as though a roller had passed over it . But the comparatively eluiet late masked a deep , surging motion that deceived only people unfamiliar with the usual course of such hurricanes . Gavin and I.ucina noticed nothing strange to begin with , fir the storm was accompanied by none of the roar they had learned to export on land . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oily motion with only a sibilant , hissing sound as the wind bore clown upon them , like a solid weight . Stripped of white caps , they rolled , like molten quick- silver , under the wan , yellow sky . By morning on the second day , however , the ship was tremb- ling and straining , torn between the gale and the waves ; and , looking out , Lucina saw that a fine veil of spray covered the vessel , shrouding it from view . She shuddered . This was a phantom ship flying through some dim waste of eternity . Al- most she expected to see the ancient mariner standing at its helm , with icicles hanging from his long gray beard ' and from under his glittering eye . ' She felt now the same uncanny , prickling fright that had always possessed her whenever Beauford , on winter nights , settled himself in his chair and began to read : There was a ship , quoth he . ' Then the sailors took to making hurried trips up the tall , swaying mast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreeable of ' hosts , went by them in the passage with only a short , curt nod . Lucina fell into her berth , racked with seasickness ; and Gavin went to hunt up the captain , whom he found intently scanning the sky , with his head turned sidewise , and his long nose pushed out to sniff the wind . He looked excited and yet confident , like a man who might enjoy any kind of conflict . He glanced briefly at Cavin , and decided that Philip Darcy 's boy would probably not be easily frightened . Looks like we 're edging into a hurricane , ' he remarked in an unhurried , conversational tone . Edging into it ? ' Cavin replied , and grinned . I supposed we were right in the middle of it . ' Have n't you ever seen a blow ? ' the captain inquired . ' No ? Well , I 'm pretty certain we 've missed the big storm , ' he remarkedcritically , running his narrowed eyes across the sky and the waves , but there 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appraising glance at Cavin , he continued : The devil of it is that after the wind dies down , then the waves try to suck you under . Best get your wife to bed . Maybe she 'll sleep through the worst of it . ' As Cavin turned to go below , it required all his strength topull the door open against the wall of wind pushing against it . The storm endured and endured , day after day , while thei 6o And Tell of Time I And Tell of Time 161 rain was blown , not in drops but in actual curtains of water against the boat , which , almost bare of canvas and stripped for battle , was yet sailing far off its course . The sailors had intended to catch fresh water for drinking , but so high had the spray been blown by the whipping wind that the rain was salt , like the sea . It was a week before the heavens broke entirely free of cloud , under such circumstances as Lucina was always to re- member . The whole occurrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , and too weak to stand , yet , when Cavin came down to tell her what was happening , she dragged her- self to the porthole to look out . 1 le had to carry her back and lay her down among her pillows , but she never forgot what she saw . The moon was shining in the clear night sky , floating as tranquilly over the turbulent ocean as it had floated over the fields and pines around ( cedar Ledge . Yet , although they could not see a clooud , : r downpour was falling from somewhere underneath the moon . They puzzled over the occurrence in vain until next nrerrnin , g Gavin came upon the captain study- ing his charts and asked hint for an explanation . Captain Baker hesitated , then with a wave of his hand invited Cavin to sit down beside him . ' I do n't know exactly what happens , ' he answered , ' but it looks like the rain , or the ocean spray , is blown so high and so fur by the wind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , out of a clear sky . Plenty of queer things happen on the ocean , ' he remarked , after a moment 's silence . Once we picked up a baby floating in a trunk far out in the Gulf  --  a live baby , sound asleep . More than once I 've wondered what story was behind that . Oh , yes , ' he said , fixing his sharp blue eyes on the water and then on the horizon . There 's plenty of things happen on the ocean  --  nrore'n you can make most people believe . ' Pulling out his pipe , he eyed his listener closely . Would you believe it , ' he asked with a half smile on his thin lips , if I told you that out from Old Point one day I saw a ' He waited a moment , puffing hard and inspecting Cavin with a cautious eye . A sea serpent , I suppose . I do n't know what else you 'd call the damn thing . ' Cavin 's face registered no surprise . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course I would . No man 's been through a war ought to be fool enough to say what can happen and what ca n't . ' The captain threw an amused glance at his passenger , a glance that said as plainly as words that here was a man who knew how to talk sense . There 's plenty of people do n't like to admit the world 's full o ' surprises , though  --  plenty of ' em , sir . ' He rose , put his pipe decisively in his pocket . Mostly city people and those that know too much . ' Oh , city people ! ' Cavin remarked in a tone that matched the captain 's . Captain Baker stood watching him for a long moment , and then he began to chuckle , his eyes meeting Cavin 's in complctr accord . As for the smart ones , ' he hazarded , do ' em good to l i ve o n i a ship a while , I always think when I hear ' cm talking . ' 1 I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching , slowly resumed its impassive lines . Or , ' he conceded , fighting a war 'd likely do ' em good , too . ' A moment longer he stood meditating , and then took Cavin into his confidence . f.awd ! I hate ' em worse'n poison , ' he exclaimed explosively , all the people who know just four words , ' T is so and ' Tai n't so . 1 ) o you know what I think ? ' he asked dryly , but with a hot flash in his usually cool eyes . Give people like that the world to run , and they 'd steer162 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 163us all right square onto the shoals . ' Shaking his finger in Gavin 's face , he repeated his words , giving them added emphasis : Right square on the shoals . It 'd never occur to ' em their charts might be off  --  never ! ' He rocked reflectively back and forth from toe to heel . If you ask mc , that 's what 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . ' Lavin grinned . Yeah . I 've met ' cm , ' he drawled ruminatively . One Yankee wanted to bet me a month 's pay alligators did n't lay eggs . ' Twar n't reasonable , he said . ' Their eyes met and held , in thorough agreement . That 's it . ' Captain linker 's thin lips clamped together . That 's it ! How we 're goin ' to live with ' em , now ? Can you tell me that ? ' Lavin shook his lie ; ul . ' I reckon we 'll make out . ' An odd smile crossed his lace . ' I.00ks like we got to ! ' Well yes , ' the c:apt:tin agreed . I 've always noticed a man does what he has to iii this world . ' A moment longer he sat still , looking at ( . avin , then rose and stuffed his pipe in his pocket . Two clays out of ( ; alveston the waves fell , and a light , steady wind began to blow . Gavin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he could tell by the feel of the ship 's movement beneath him that only the surface of the water was now disturbed , not the great depths beneath . The air against his cheeks was warm and friendly ; the sunlight glanced back into his eyes from an ocean that no longer was dull and leaden but blue and sparkling , with light , running waves dancing joyously across it in the same rhythmic motion that bends the grass on the prairie or dips the yellow dafliidils to earth in spring . Ile did not consciously think of the day as beautiful , or rejoice in their safety . He was not made that way . But as always in his life  --  in the war , in the longer war of Reconstruction , in his old age  --  a difficulty or danger once over and surmounted induced in him a kind of growing , heady excitement and a deep , almost passionate , joy in being alive , in breathing the sweet air , in moving his limbs upon the earth that he loved . Unlike Lucina , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , like Mary , the mother of Jesus , meditated on these things in her heart , Lavin had a more elemental kinship with the earth and the stars and the swift-flowing winds . I lc slid not ever consciously take note of them , nor did he ever in his mind call anything beautiful or lovely . His feet seemed to draw up from the soil the strength of Antaeus ; and he had no need to think about what he saw because he responded to it instantly , without thought . If he had lived to hear the expression creative evolution bandied about , he would have understood its meaning , drawing his knowledge not out of philosophy books , but straight out of his own sensations , the way John Locke believed men must . For had he not always felt life flowing through him , defying death or any other obstacle ? After Chickamauga , even while the dead lay unburied around him , and he himself lay on tile rocky ground with a bleeding hole in his shoulder , he knew that he would live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth , as he did , with such warm , groping , loving fingers and caressed the sky with his eyes , even while the blood poured out of him ? He did not think then that the earth was too lovely to leave , and Hades probably a dark and dreary place . Philip might have meditated on these matters , but not his son , Gavin . He never even thought of dying . He was only aware , as he lay there , of a kind of intoxicating delight in being still alive ; it was as though some magnetic current from the earth passed directly into him , unifying his separate impressions into a164 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 165strong and vivid sense of the life that flowed through him and ( though he did not think of it in such terms ) through the wide universe around him , too . It was a sense that he felt but never analyzed , and it burned like a flame within him after danger , after happiness , after even death or loss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always turned to Lucina , finding in her the completion of the strange and curious heightening of his own feelings . In time she learned to allow for the appearance of this fever in him , but never to understand it . Life flowed through her by a different channel altogether . She took it not so much by instinct as by thought and by prayer , though she clid not often call it prayer . She was therefore unprepared li , r the energetic delight that animated Gavin , who was usually so calm , as he burst into their cabin early that first morning , the third week in their voyage , when the sky clearrecl a and the waves began to run steadily , like horses trained four a Tong race , toward the shore . Suddenly he felt , as he stood on deck aril watched the sunrise , that there was nothing on earth he coould think of that he wanted . To be alive was a joy , a thrilling pulse irr his blood . Lucina must come up on deck with him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was returning without shoes to his feet ; he forgot that he had a wife to support , that the years ahead promised no least security , none of any kind . Ile was conscious only of a fierce , exultant happiness that he wanted Lucina to share ; and thinking so , he went down to get her . She had awakened that morning , feeling refreshed and hungry fin  --  the first time in many a day . It was late when she stirred , aunt Gavin had been up for some time . When she heard a knock on the door she thought it was he , but it was Maria , who , pale but determined , came in with a jug of hot water and a rlish of oatmeal . Lay still , ' she cautioned her mistress . The cap 'm tol ' me to feed you lak a baby befo ' you tried to get up . War n't it awful ? ' she asked , gesturing vaguely with her full hands to indicate the terror she had felt . Lucina swallowed the hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There , Maria , you finish it . ' Maria rolled her eyes , and leaned against the narrow bunk , taking the dish from Lucina as she spoke . " Fo ' Gawd , ' she told Lucina , I thought I was daid . Ai n't you surprised to be alive ? Jake 's still a-prayin ' ; he 's afraid de Lawd 'll let de storm come back again , I reckon , ef'n he stops . ' She held her spoon in the air and drank the last drops from the upturned bowl . Then , leaning back , she surveyed her mistress with an air of visible displeasure . Yo ' har needs fixin ' , Miss Lucy , do n't it ? ' she asked , cocking her head on one side so as to get a better view . An ' I reckon I better git out de Florida water an ' de sponge an ' de towels . Dis heah is de fust water dey 'd lemme have , ' she remarked , glancing at the jug , an ' dey says us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked at Lucina brightly , suddenly hopeful . Is dey right , Miss Lucina ? Is we gwine-a land today atwhut 's de name of dat ar place we 's gwine to ? ' Galveston . ' Lucina stretched herself , yawning . Galveston . ' How marvellous to be married to Cavin , she thought , and to be exploring the world like this , with him ! She humumed a tune , no longer missing Cedar Ledge , as she had in the long nights when the wind tore at the ship and she lay terrified and seasick in her berth , with Cavin up above helping the sailors . Galveston ! ' Maria repeated the word slowly . ' Dc name of dat place soun ' plain indecent to me . ' Latina was never able to erase that impression from her maid 's mind , try as she might . The first time that she took Maria back , to spend a summer1 66 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 167there , Maria cast one horrified look at the swimming beach filled with men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't I tell you , Miss Lucy , dat dis heah war n't no decent place ? Jes ' look out dar ! ' That later reaction was based on this , her first attempt to repeat the name after Lucina , who burst out laughing at sight of her maid 's shocked face . Oh , Maria , how absurd ! I t was named , Cavin says , for a man named Galvez . He was a Spanish governor , or something , in Louisiana . ' Maria accepted the correction , but remained obviously un- convinced by it . Do n't you ' specs I letter git you dressed an ' ready now ? ' she asked , politely turning the conversation . No telling when us gwine-a git ( fur . Who gwine-a meet us , anyway , an ' den whut does us do , IA har does us go ? ' I do n't know ! ' I , ue ina cried , springing out of bed , and what 's Inure , Maria , I do n't ( arc . ' Well , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aroun ' like a ilea ? ' Fell me ( Lit , ' Maria retorted severely , and then her face relaxed , and she smiled in anticipation of a surprise she had been reserving liir Lucina . ' Did you know , ' she inquired , her eager , dark eyes lighting up her thin , brown face , did you know I brung along some cornmeal mixed wid some orris powder Miss Ella gin me , li ) ' us lcf ' home ? Set still , now , an ' I 'll bresh it in and out yo ' ! laid . l.awd , Miss Lucy , you'se sho got a putty lot o ' har , ' she exclaimed as she began sifting the cornmeal on her mistress 's long black hair and brushing it out in repeated , even strokes , She had just finished dressing Lucina and was fastening Margaret 's slippers on her feet when Gavin put his face eagerly in at the door . When he saw Maria , he chuckled , Well , Maria ! The Lord spared you , did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , you were getting ready to die . Where 's Jake ? Go tell him he better quit praying now and come on up and help me . ' Hurry up , Sweet , ' Gavin urged her , when Maria had left . Lucina caught the excitement in his voice and responded to it . Land 'll be showing up before you know it , now . ' His eyes were bright and his smile wide . He was standing with his back against the door and his arms held out invitingly . You better come kiss me , while you got a chance , ' he advised her . I 'm going to be a powerful busy man after we land . ' How do you know I want to kiss you , anyway ? ' Lucina demanded , tilting back his head with her hands and pushing his hair away from his forehead . Maybe I do n't , ' she warned him , raising herself on tiptoe to smile into his eyes . Never , she thought , had she seen anybody 's eyes so blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or brown in them . Lavin laughed happily , dropping his arms closer around her . Oh , yes , you do , ' he answered confidently , smiling down at her . Do n't you ? ' . He held her there for a moment , with his face above hers , taking in the white curve of her brow , her soft brown eyes , her smiling lips , and the poise of her head as she gazed provocatively up at him . The fragrance of her hair and the warmth of her slight figure poured through I-in- like wine , and his arms tightened about her . Lucina ! ' he cried , looking at her with his heart iu his eyes while he groped falteringly for words . You 're sweet , ' he told her at last , with the awkward shyness that all her life she loved in him . What it was she could not have said that both hurt her and set her heart to pounding whenever Cavin looked at her like this , with all his defences down . Some vague , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 169sadness overtook her , but as quickly as it came , it went , leaving her swayed by a sweet and unfamiliar ecstasy that she could not name . Upon deck the sun was high , and the air was like summer in upper Georgia . Lucina and Gavin stood by the rail , peering into the distance ahead where they could just make out the wavering outline of what appeared to be land . Like a narrow sandbar , the shadow stretched across the water , steadily growingbroader and clearer as they watched it , until finally they could see its outlines plainly under the noonday sun . Lucina , looking out across the water , was struck by the quality of the light that fill in blinding brilliance everywhere . It hurts my eyes , ' she complained , blinking . It 's always that way , runless it rains , ' Gavin replied , laughing a little . Wait till you get out on the prairies ; there the light sparkles on the grass , just the way it does on the Gulf . That 's why Pa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees  --  so as to get shade . Ugh it 's not much of a house , ' he warned Lucina with a slight anxiety replacing his amusement . ' Big enough , but kind of bare and unfinished compared to Cedar Ledge . It 's never even been painted , ' he said slowly . I do n't know what you 'll think about it . Pa 's never done much to it . ' Still '  --  his memory groped hesitantly back to the time before the war , when he had lived in that house  --  still , there 's a something about it  --  well , I do n't know , I liked it , ' he ended , unable to explain his liking . There was a fig tree by my room ; I used to reach out through the window and pull figs , before I got up  --  big purple ones . And there used to be an owl in the chinaberry tree outside my other window . ' He tightened his arm around her . You 'll like it . I know you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , I expect I shall . ' She felt in a humor to like anything , as she leaned against him , watching the curving shore appear . His eyes twinkled as he looked at her , and crinkled into folds at their corners . It was a perfect world , as far as he was concerned  --  an entirely perfect world . Today , on the twenty-sixth of September  --  he put the date down in his mind to remember  --  he was starting his married life in Texas . The land loomed ahead of them maddeningly close , but it took them until late afternoon actually to reach it . They drew in slowly , sounding every few moments for the shifting sandbars that sometimes unexpectedly appeared after a storm in the channel . Just when Lucina had decided they would never reach shore that night , they picked up speed , and before she expectedit to happen the boat was creaking against the wharf of the warehouse , where thousands of bales of cotton and huge barrels of sugar-cane syrup and various wooden crates lay piled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deckhands were making fast the ropes to the pier she looked around her curiously , noticing half a dozen ships besides theirs drawn up at the long wharf . She stared w i t I r intense interest at the banners above them . What countries did they represent ? she wondered . This was a lirreit ; n land , indeed , this Texas Gavin had brought her to . ' I'Inern , with a thrill of pleasure , her eye fell on one flag that she recognized . It was one which Beauford had many times pointed out to his children in the big map book that lay in his office . Lucina touched Cavin 's arm . There 's an English ship , ' she told him , not knowing why the sight gave her a certain pleasure . Amidst all this strangeness. 170 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 171it was a symbol to her of old , remembered things , and far less alien to her now than the Union flag floating above the warehouse  --  a flag she associated with more recent enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; an English ship ! ' Oh , ' he replied , indifferently , glancing in the direction where her eyes were turned . There arc always lots of them here in dock . ' He watched carefully to see whether their luggage was being brought up , and then , when he knew exactly where their few belongings were stacked , he turned to her and amplified his last remark . They say that the Republic could n't decide for some time whether to join the British Empire or the United States . Anyway , there are always plenty of English about . ' Lucina listened , slightly mystified . What was this Republic Lavin was always retelling to ? Everything about this bright , burning land was only a kind of diffused buzzing in her mind . She slid nut know , as yet , that Texans were apt to refer to San Jacinto instead of Yorktown as the symbol of their liberties , and to speak of ' Spain and Ntexico as easily as of England . She did not realize either that , as a boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had helped to establish the Republic , men who had entered the Union under a treaty , expecting to withdraw when , or if , it pleased them to do so . It took her months to sec that this fact explained why the sadness of defeat in Georgia blazed in Texas to a hotter , more defiant wrath . All she felt as she first stepped on Texas soil was that this was a strange land to which she had come , a land whose history was not yet laid down in her bones , as it was , apparently , in Gavin 's . Yet , her heart acknowledged , not altogether a strange land . For were there not Georgians already in it ? And did not Texansand Georgians lie buried together from Virginia to Tennessee ? Soon , she resolved , she would know what Gavin was talking about whenever he casually mentioned , as he so often did , the names every Texan seemed to have at his tongue 's end : San Felipe . The Alamo . Goliad . San Jacinto . Travis . Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a roll . The Republic  --  soon she would be able to use the word as easily as Gavin . Lavin had been leaning over the railing , impatient to be on shore . Almost before the boat was made fast to the dock lie was on the wharf , holding out his hand to Lucina . Her knees shook beneath her , but she raised her head and walked firmly ashore . Captain Baker followed them , approaching Gavin with a slight frown between his brows . ' Galveston 's swarming with Yankees , ' he remarked . Has been all summer , of course . But I 've just been told that General Gregory is here setting up the Freedman 's Bureau '  --  he made a gesture of distaste  --  and things are especially wild right now . ' He looked from Gavin to Lucina , thinking how he had best state the facts without alarming her . No use beating around the bush , he decided . She 'd have to learn how things were , sooner or later . Every Unionist in the state has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickings , and the town 's running over with drunk negroes , ' he explained . You all better plan to stay on board tonight , had n't you ? ' The way he put the question showed that it was his own opinion . Lavin was eager to be off , but as the sun was near setting , he realized they would not get far , even if they started , that night . Besides , was there anyone to meet thcrn ? He turned the possibilities over in his mind . Maybe I better go out and look around a little , ' he decided . Lucina can stay with you , I suppose , Captain ? ' he inquired 172 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 173This business of having a wife made a man mighty cautious , he thought , taking out his pistols and looking them over . I 'm coming along , ' Lucina answered firmly . Though I appreciateCaptain Baker 's courtesy , of course . ' She smiled at the captain and laid a determined hand inside Cavin 's arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saw , as he glanced doubtfully at her , that her mind was made up . Well , ' he said , dropping his pistols back in his belt and tightening it , I reckon I can look after you . ' Then he turned to Jake . Do n't you get off this boat , ' he warned him . Stay right here with Maria . We 'll be back in a couple of hours , at most . If we do n't , you 'll look us up , Captain ? ' he said to his host . I do n't expect any trouble , though . Come on , Lucina , ' he said , drawingher hand closer . ' I expect pa 's sent a wagon to meet the boat , but Lord knows where the drivers are  --  probably all drunk . We better round them up , or figure out some other way to get started in the nun nine . ' They walked to the h curt of the warehouse , from which a long wooden sidewalk led a  --  oss the sandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ k from the shore , with the cathedral looming high above it . Approaching it , they soon realized that Captain Baker 's inli , rnr:ttinn had been correct . The place was crowded with half-drunken white soldiers in blue uniforms and with entirely drunken negroes who had rushed down to Galvestonexpecting to receive , not the freedom the Bureau offered , but money , horses , mules , land . The Northern officers were unprepared for this evidence of how frequently those who have cast off their chains prefer booty to redemption . Nor were they used to handling importunateblack men who demanded the moon , and who , not gettingit , curled up on your doorstep and promptly went sound asleep . Or else became drunk and violent . The responsibleofficers reflected uneasily that half of these negroes ought to be in jail ; but would n't that move make a fine impression on the Reconstruction authorities ? And in case Sheridan , sitting down at New Orleans in charge of the Fifth Reconstruction District , took a dislike to you , where could you get a job half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that the town was on the verge of a riot . Lavin could not help but laugh out loud when he saw all the negroes milling around . La ! ' he said to Lucina . They act just like our hands at a good old shouting revival ! ' It was clear to him that they regarded this occasion as some kind of a celebration like Christmas Eve , or a barbecue. ' 1 1w few who were sober stood around in groups with good-natured , expectant faces , looking exactly like the servants at Locust Hill , Lavin remembered , when his father was distributing new garmentsor an extra issue of rations . Most of them , however , had had far too much liquor and lay stretched out too drunk to move , their woolly black heads flat against the white crushed shell that covered the sidewalks . Gosh ! They 'll have a time getting that out of their hair , ' Cavin remarked to Lucina , laughing as he passed the rear nil wilt figures . A f e w Union officers were trying desperately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n order , but their efforts made little impression on the Crow d , through which Lucina and Lavin walked almost unnoticed , fir Confederate uniforms were still too commonly worn on the Galveston streets to arouse the least notice . Gavin felt no special alarm until they passed a company of black soldiers parading in the street , all heavily armed . He then urged Lucina around a corner , toward the residentialsection , planning to return to the boat by a longer route that ' 74 And Tell of Timewould skirt the offices of the Bureau where the largest crowd was gathered . He would leave her there on the boat , he decided , and start out again , by himself ; to see whether he could find the wagons , which , he felt confident , Philip had sent to meet him . The town was in worse confusion than he had thought possible when he agreed to let Lucina accompany him . Along the quieter streets , however , there was little excitement ; all of the noise and rioting was apparently centred around the offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back avenues , children were playing in large yards enclosed by white palings or wrought-iron knees , and a few people were setting out to town , walking unconcernedly along under the chinaberry trees . Lavin felt his anxiety slacken , and lingered to point out to Lucina how many houses in ( ; alvcston were set up on extremely high pillars , with the spice underneath them paved in red brick and used lire cool outdoor sitting-rooms . Some of the houses , she noticed , had graceful , curving steps which led up , by a double approach , to high , wide balconies screened with vines and overlooking side gardens still full of brilliant color . The streets seemed vaguely f:crniliar , and all at once she knew they reminded her of Savannah . So did the white houses with double galleries onto which long doors , flanked with green blinds , opened , and the rows of ' palms and oleanders , and the grassy lanes between the curbs . Still , there was something differentabout the place . As she walked along , she decided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and certainly there was an even more luxuriant growth of foliage here than at home . Lemon trees , banana plants with long , glossy leaves , and roses were everywhere  --  deep yellow roses , almost golden , lightly tinged with crimson . Their heavy fragrance hung suspended in the warm evening air , and , with it , the smell of mintAnd Tell of Time 175and sweet lavender . Ah ! yes , there was something in this strange country she could call her own  --  the air shc breathed . No , even that had a latent aroma that she now began to sense more and more , as the rising breeze blew in from over the water . Salt , ' she thought . Of course , that 's it , salt . ' She drew closer to Cavin , and they stood watching the sunset , listening to the booming sound of the surf against the shore , a mile or more away . As the coolness of night came on , and the Gulf breeze swept over the island , people began to come out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bureau was located , Cavin and Lucina walked along the back avenues that he remembered from his boyhood when he had accompanied Uncle Matt to Galveston to receive supplies shipped in from New Orleans and London  --  oatmeal and smoked fish and bittermarmalade , brandy , coffee , bananas , and Jamaica rum . It 's not like this out in the country , ' Cavin warned Lucina , waving his hand to take in the gardens and the streets bordered with flowering shrubs , the immaculate white houses , and the freshly dressed children guarded by black nurses in white kerchiefs . Galveston is the '  --  he hesitated , not knowing just how to make his point  --  the Savannah of Texas , ' he went on , repeatingLucina 's own thought . It 's full of people from New Orleansand Pass Christian , and English cotton firms have representativesliving here . Still , I like it better on the plantation , ' he said , already feeling the uneasiness that cities never 1:tiled to arouse in him . Lucina 's ear picked up what Cavin 's had missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were some speaking a tongue she had never heard be  --  fi ( re . She pulled on Cavin 's sleeve and spoke so softly that he had to bend his head to hear her. 176 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time ' 77Who are those people ? ' she asked him . Listen . ' Who ? ' Cavin responded , taken by surprise . Who do you mean ? Oh , ' he went on , following her eyes , they 're Germans . There are lots of them in Galveston , nearly all Unionists , too , though not all , ' he explained . There were some Germans  --  as brave as anybody  --  in Hood 's army , and they had n't a slave to fight for . ' He paused there , meditating . Most of the Texas people who voted four to one for secession had no slaves , anyhow . Well , ' he shrugged his shoulders , I was talking about the Germans . Most of them go on out to West Texas , where they like the climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the crowd that landed from one boat , but they were all teachers and people like that . No gardeners . ' The account aroused of her memories in Cavin 's mind , which he proceeded to share with I.ucina . He smiled as he remembered some ( ; ermans who had settled in a corner of Cypress County , trying to raise huge blue turkeys for a living . ' They used to diie droveS of ' cm into Houston and Galveston , pushing there along with crooked sticks just like cowboys driving cattle , ' he tole ) I , ue ina . You 've never seen cattle drives either , have you ? ' he asked her , struck with the thought . You 've got a heap to learn about this country , have n't you ? ' He stopped short , suddenly conscious of all the things he ought to explain to her . Where should he begin ? He seized on the first thing that came into his mind .

They 'll run you through in a minute and stomp you to death , if ' they get a chance . Well that was n't what I was talking about , either , was it ? ' I ntent on what she saw around her , Lucina was only half listening . She was so absorbed that Gavin , too , fell silent , and beganclosely scrutinizing the people that they passed . He no-ticed , then , that nearly all those who were not in uniform , men and women alike , wore on their clothes some mark to indicate whether they were Confederates or Unionists . In their lapels or on their shoulders they had pinned small flags or twisted ribbons , and strangers exchanged quick , searching glances as they passed , to see whether they were approaching friend or foe . Look , Lucina ! ' Cavin said , pointing out what he had observed . Probably they do n't want any more arguments than they can help . Wonder when the Yankees took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all at once , how long it had been since he had received any Texas news . Well ! ' she exclaimed proudly , throwing up her small , sleek head , that 's one thing we do n't need to do in Georgia . Everybodyknows what side we are on . ' She could not imagine existing , as the citizens of Galveston had had to learn to do , under the very heel of their foes , and surrounded by people that had opposed secession from the beginning . In her county in Georgia , she had never met a single Unionist in her whole life . But Cavin could understand how the citizens of Galvestc en had worked out a way of living together , without drawn bat battle , even under the circumstances that now surrounded t I e e r i e . During the war , encamped before Chattanooga , he himself had crept down , night after night , on his stomach to talk , a ross a narrow creek in whispers , to a Northern boy only a little older than himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sometimes saved from his own supper to ofl*r to his Southernenemy , Cavin tried to put his feelings into words . Some Yankees are all right , Lucina , ' he hazarded . If they just do n't push us too far , we ought-a could manage to get along somehow with them . ' 178 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 179He wished that he knew what had become of the blue-coated boy who , one night , had silently handed him , across the creek , a sandwich and an apple . Even yet , his mouth watered as he thought of how good the food had tasted , as he lay on his stomachin the mud biting into it , and how it had , for a time at least , assuaged the terrible craving inside him . Ugh ! ' cried Lucina , suddenly shrugging her slight shoulders in writhing disgust . They 're like flies  --  everywhere . Let 's get started , Cavin , right away . See , it 'll be moonlight . ' She threw out her hand to where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the town , and shuddered . I ca n't bear stayinghere . ' It was the first time she had seen so many blue uniformssince Sherman 's troops had marched into the garden at Cedar Ledge , trampling it under foot . Suddenly Gavin kit the same haste to leave Galveston , to get out into Ilie open prairie , to reach Locust Hill Plantation . Unconsciouslyhe still t h ( ncght of it as unchanged by the war . Once there , he Ht , wit lc his Ii  --  et on his own soil , he could begin life in earnest . Here in Galveston he felt disturbed and uneasy . The sight of so many Yankee soldiers about was beginning to make an impression on hint that he could not shake off . Maybe a man could n't even fcrni to suit himself , with all these soldiers about . Well , we 'll see , ' he thought ; and rubbing his chin thoughtfully , he met Luciva 's anxious eyes . I 'd like to move out of here , myself , ' he admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Quickening his steps , he said : Let 's get back to the boat . Maybe Matt 's already there . ' As they drew close to shore , Gavin looked up and down the waterfront , scanning it closely , to see whether he could pick out Philip 's mules from among the wagons and teams tied to hitchingposts beside the wharf . So occupied , they were almost upon the Afary Frances before he was aware either of their nearness toit or of the negro soldier approaching them on the narrow plank walk , reeling as he walked . Lucina saw him , however , and stopped dead in her tracks , fearing what she knew would happen if they met him on the passage that was , at best , barely wide enough for two . She knew that one of the men would have to step down in the sand , and she was positive that Cavin would not be the one to do so , nor would he permit her to move aside by so much as a hairsbreadth . Her sudden pause halted Cavin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision almost unconsciously , he threw Lucina behind him with one hand , and with the other drew the pistol from his belt . The huge negro saw the gesture and , inflated with arrogance , was just drunk enough to defy it . He took several uncertain steps , weaving a crooked course back and forth across the walk , waving his gun in front of him , and cursing in a variety of expressionsthat amused Cavin even as he pulled his pistol . Realizing instantly that the Freedman 's Bureau would probablyhold him in jail for so much as touching one of their charges , Cavin first hoped , as he watched the soldier , to shove him off balance and seize his gun , but with Lucina behind lcicn , he dared not risk missing his hold . Also he knew  --  and he did not have to take time to formulate the idea  --  that white people could not long continue to live in Texas if they once began stepping aside for their former slaves . Almost automatically , his mind made a clear path through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he called out to the soldier to halt instantly where he was . His voice penetrated through the mist that covered the negro 's mind , and some old habit of obedience reasserted itself in him . For a second he paused , motionless , and his arm fell . That instant was enough , however , to give Jake , who had1 80 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 181watched the encounter from on deck , time to reach the spot and fall upon the colored soldier from behind , throwing him fiercely to the ground . His head hit the boards with so loud a thud that Cavin thought it must have cracked , and he lay still , stunned by the fall . Stooping , Gavin unstrapped the negro 's cartridge belt and gun , handing them to Jake , and slipped his own pistol back into its holster . Pushing the soldier off onto the sand with his foot , he turned a surprised face to Jake . Well , for the Lord 's sake ! How 'd you happen to be here ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were almost at the boat , where Captain Baker was standing on the gangplank , his rifle now dropped to his side and his face expressing the relief he felt , as Lucina and Cavin reached the wharf where he was anchored . By George ! ' the captain exclaimed , I thought I was going to have to kill that dunned nigger , but I was afraid I 'd hit you , too , if I started Iiring . ' Then I saw Jake making for the brute and I figured t hat was the best way out of it . Lord ! you ought to have seen your boy , ' he said , addressing Cavin . He made the distance between here and that creature '  --  he pointed to the still motionless soldier in one jump , I do believe . ' Sho , ' said Jake , " twar n't nothin ' else to do . ' Cavin put his hand on Jake 's shoulder and breathed deeply , three or four times . ' Boy , ' he said at last , you 've earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remark and gazed mildly at his master , his 1I1 is-black face suffused with a grin . ' Dal nigger was plain lookin ' fin- trouble , ' he announced and grinned wider , showing all his white teeth in a pleased smile . Us gin it to him all right , did n't us ? ' Cavin continued to stare at his servant and then smiled as broadly as Jake . Well , ' he said , I reckon you 've earned the shirt I 've got on , besides , if you want it . ' Jake 's face brightened perceptibly . ' Dal shirt is gittin ' mighty thin and old , Mas ' Cavin . Dat 's de truf , ' he agreed , joining heartily in the laughter that followed his response . Here , Cavin , take this , ' Lucina said , handing back his pistol . Where 'd you get it ? ' he asked her in astonishment , feeling under his coat . Why , ' she said calmly , I slipped it out while you were drawing yours . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let 's start , Cavin , ' she implored him . Right away . ' Captain Baker leaned back , throwing his weight on his firm brown hands and clasping the boat 's railing behind him . His eyes were narrowed and speculative under his eyebrows bleached almost white by the sun and wind . He pursed his lips , whistling softly . Obviously he was making up his mind . Suddenlyhe turned toward Cavin and addressed him directly . You 've brought the right kind of wife to Texas , sir , ' he said admiringly , and I expect her judgment is pretty nearly right about leaving tonight . When that nigger starts to making trouble , you 'd better be out of town . They 'll never send after you - too much to do here . ' He took his hands off the railing and leaned forward , fixing his blue eyes soberly on Cavin 's . ' Last time I was in port , ' he announced in a cold , dead-level tone , they were trying a man for shooting a black soldier who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only reason they did n't hang him was because his friends rubbed the nigger jury 's palms with gold . ' Cavin listened without comment . Yes , ' Captain Baker went on , eyeing the black figure that lay stretched out on the white sand in the moonlight , I expect you better get out , quick as you can . No use deliberately court-182 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 183ing trouble , in these times . There 's plenty you ca n't avoid , ' he concluded . Cavin nodded . The advice sounded reasonable to him . I ' 11 go see whether any of the mules and wagons tied down there by the wharf are ours . No , not this time , Lucina , ' he said firmly , as she half-rose . I ' 11 have to hunt Matt up , too , ' he informed the captain . I 'll take you along , Jake , ' said Cavin , abruptly turning to his servant . See if that pistol you 've got 's working . Do n't draw if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him sternly . As Lucina watched Cavin reloading his long black pistols , she suddenly recalled the pearl-handled ones that always lay in a purple velvet case beside her father 's bed . Many afternoons , before the war , as she began to grow out of childhood , he had taken them out and had her aim at a target , under his direction , showing her how to place her weight and stretch out her arm . In Texas , apparently , she meditated , guns were not laid away in velvet cases . She watched Cavin and Jake moving in and out the mules and wagons some distance below her on the sand . They were carefullyexamining the mules ' ears , why she could not imagine . Two long slits and one short , in the middle . That 's our mark . Remember , Jake ? ' Cavin asked his black boy . Check up on this row , and I 'll take the next . ' Reckon dey 's branded ? ' Jake answered , peering at the brown flanks of the animals . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dis-heah mark ? ' He drew in the soft white sand with his toe a figure made up of the initials L H for Locust Hill . Gavin looked down at the firm white sand and saw drawn in it the brand L. Yes , of course , that 's it ; that 's Pa 's brand . But mostly he uses it on his cattle , not his mules . Still , you mightlook ; it 's plenty light to see . ' He threw a glance upward at the full moon now riding overhead . No trouble travelling this kind of night , ' he remarked to Jake . Naw , suh , ' the negro replied uneasily . I plain do n't like dese-here nigger soijers dey gots aroun ' heah . Looks lak dey 's layin ' fur trouble evy time dey turns aroun ' . ' Cavin was too occupied to answer . He moved up and down the long rows of animals , now unhitched from their wagons and tied with long ropes to cedar posts set some distance back from the high-tide mark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wander far , even if they managed to work their halters loose . There were water troughs close by , and places for feedingthe animals . In some of the wagons , their negro drivers lay asleep , guarding their masters ' property , and ready for early loading when the sun began to rise over the water . Here 's Colonel Brashear 's team , ' Cavin called out to Jake , recognizing a neighboring planter 's wagon-train by the three short slits in the mules ' ears . Lord ! I 'd forgotten all about tasselson bridles . ' Cavin felt vaguely excited and pleased to see the Brashear mules bridled , despite the war , as they had always been  --  with good steel bits in their mouths , instead of rope , and red silk tassels floating below their ears . Yes , they were fat and round , too , well cared for . Obviously food supplies were not so scarce in Texas as in Georgia , and not all the work animals had been seized by the Confederate government . Ours ought to be along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hands in together . Look sharp , now . I know Pa was expecting me on this boat . He 'd have had somebody here . ' But their search was fruitless . No Locust hill mules were on the beach , and no wagons either. 184 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 185We 'll have to go up in town and find Uncle Matt , Jake , ' Cavin decided . You run back to the boat and tell Miss Lucina where we are going , and not to be worried if we do n't get back till late . I 'll stay here , ' he concluded , throwing himself down on the sand to await Jake 's return . He lay with his hands under his head staring up at the moon , over which now and then white clouds were floating , momentarilygleaming like silver against the vast dark sky . The waves broke with an incessant rushing hiss and roar upon the long white beach , and the warm October air was so full of salt that when he put out his tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched out his long legs and yawned , settling his hips comfortably into the white , drifting sand . While he could , he took his rest , just as , in the army , he had always been able to sleep undisturbed by thoughts of coming battle or of past misery . But deep inside him , unknown to him , his attention kept guard . This was an attribute he shared with Philip  --  the ability to take momentary rest in the centre of turmoiland then to spring up instantly at call , ready for action . Before Jake reached him , he heard across the sands the echo of the negro 's quick running steps and knew , before he arrived , that he had news of some kind to report . Uncle Matt 's at de boat , now , waitin ' fur us , wid de teams an ' all de hands whut ai n't run off . Miss Lucy is already a-settin ' in de wagon . ' He paused to catch his breath , then added , ' Matt 's been havin ' a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cavin was on his feet and had started toward the boat beforeJake had finished his recital . Uncle Matt saw him coming and hurried to meet him on the sand , his long white whiskers blowing in the breeze and his hair shining like a halo under the moon . Lawd Gawd ! Mas ' Cavin . I nebber would a knowed you ! ' he exclaimed , his face expressing the relief he felt at being able to turn over his responsibilities to Gavin . I wuz lookin ' fur a boy lak you wuz when you run off to de wah , ' he continued , in an apologetic , surprised tone , an ' heah you is , as big as yo ' pa , comin ' home wid a wife to boot . Well , I be doggoned , it do beat all . ' He stood off , admiring the man Cavin had become . Cavin laid his arm around Matt 's shoulders . The old man had often sung him to sleep , singing over and over again , till his own eyes closed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My gran'pa , or some o ' my folks way back yonder wuz a king in Af'ica , ' Matt always told him before he began to chant , an ' dis heah song I 'm singin ' you is whut de witch-gals uster sing in front o ' him , in de dark o ' de moon to raise sperits . Don ' ask me no mo ' , caze I ai n't gwine to tell you . ' And he would remain stubbornly silent , despite all Cavin 's pleadings . Well , I reckon I am most too big for you to sing to , now , Uncle Matt , ' Cavin admitted , but I 'm mighty glad to see you . How 's Pa ? ' Dey 's well ; dey 's all well , Mas ' Cavin , all ' cep'n FitzHugh . He mighty poly . ' FitzHugh ? ' Cavin broke in . Who 's FitzHugh ? ' Ai n't you heared ? Lawdy-me ! ' Matt grinned . Time you wuz comin ' home , when you do n't know your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " T is time ! Well , ' he laughed , they do n't know I have a wife either , for that matter . Tell me about Pa . ' Um-m-m , ' Uncle Matt answered regretfully ; yo ' pa ai n't as young as he wuz when him and me took off fur Texas , an ' dat 's de truf . ' Then his recent experience flooded over his lips . I'se mighty sorry to be so late gittin ' heah , suh ; but my Gawd-1 86 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 187a-mussy ! ' he declared in a burst of wrath , dem Yankees is de Dickens an ' Tom Walker .

Whut do you reckon dey wanted me to swar ? ' he demanded , eyeing Gavin with indignant scorn in his eyes . Dey wanted me to swar ' twar n't Mas ' Philip 's cotton a-tall I wuz bringin ' to de boat , but some dat belonged to de Confedrig govament ; an ' den dey said even I 'd swar to de fack dat it was govament cotton , dey 'd pay me so much .

They seem to think so , Uncle Matt . ' Lawd Gawd ! ' sighed Uncle Matt . All dat soun ' pow'ful curious to me . ' Cavin smiled . To me , too , ' he agreed . Well , go on , Uncle Matt . What 'd you tell the man ? ' Uncle Matt replied hotly . I tol ' him I raised dis cotton , an ' it was dis yeah 's crap , when dar ai n't no Confedrig govament no mo ' ; an ' dey said I wuz a crazy " ol ' fool , an ' I kep ' worryin ' ' bout meetin ' you , an ' dey kep ' on sayin ' dey wuz gwine-a markit U.S.A. anyway , but dat it would set better wid dem up above ' em ef'n dey had my swar , to hand in wid dair papers .

De Lawd sont him , dar ain ' no doubt about dat . ' Solemnly he nodded his old white head up and down in confirmation of his last remark . Lavin controlled his impatience , knowing there was no use on earth trying to hurry Uncle Matt 's account . What happened then ? ' Well , he say he walkin ' by an ' notice Mas ' Philip 's waggins out dar in front , an ' he ask me , " Whut 's going on here ? " But he seem to know widout askin ' , case right off , fo ' I kin say a word , he turn aroun ' to de men at de desk an ' say sort o ' snappy and short-like , " How much ?

" Dey seems to know he takes keer o ' yo ' pa 's business . Den dey lemme go , ' he said with a long sigh of relief , an ' I lit out , an ' heah I is . ' Pausing , he began to run his fingers through his pockets . I mos ' forgot , ' he explained . Gunnel Rutherford gim me a bunch o ' papers . Heah dey is , ' he said , stretching out his black hand , with the papers resting on his pinkish-yellow palm . Cavin took them and scrutinized them closely . You can mighty near read by this moon , but not quite , ' he concluded , sticking them in his own pocket . I 'll look ' em over , quick as I get to the boat . ' I suppose you brought a tent along and some cover ? ' Cavin asked , as they turned back. 1 88 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 189Yas-suh .

Let ' em alone . They 'll be coming back quick enough , same as they did to Cedar Ledge , soon as they get hungry or sick .

' He held out his hand and the negro , after fumbling around in his clothes , produced a dirty slip of wrinkled paper . I done got eveything , ' Uncle Matt assured him . De man at de supply-house called off de order to me , an ' I put ' em in de waggins myself . ' Then we 're set to go ? ' Lavin inquired . Yas-suh , ef'n my young mistis is . ' Looks like she 's all ready .

She kine o ' quick-on-de-trigger , seem lak , ' Uncle Matt grinned . Lavin paused only to smile at her in passing , and then went below to examine the papers in his hand . Coffee , salt , ' he read , holding the paper to the flickering yellowlight of an oil lamp screwed into the cabin 's wall . ' Thread , lavender soap , mackerel , blue denim , red calico , chewing plug . ' His eye ran down the page and he smiled . The list was not much different from the ones he had carried into Galveston before the war . Texans , he thought suddenly , could still send for salt and expect to get it . Yes , everything was checked off , as Uncle Matt had said . He was up the narrow steps in three leaps , and , after shaking hands with Captain Baker , climbed up beside Lucina on the wagon seat . Hop in behind with Maria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tell the other hands to fall in and I 'll see ' em all when we make camp . Holler when the last wagon 's ready to start . ' Wait a minute , ' Captain Baker said , and hurried below . On his return , he handed Lavin a shotgun and a rifle , and some ammunition . You have only your pistols ? ' he inquired . I thought so . You better take these along , too . No telling what you 'll run into betweenhere and the Brazos . Good luck ! ' He seized ( , avin 's hand and bowed to Lucina . I hope you 'll honor my ship by sailing with me again , Miss Lucy . ' Matt , from the end of the wagon-train , waved his hat in the air and whooped twice in a high sharp voice that the mules recognized . At the same instant the drivers cracked their black , snake-like whips , making a sound like exploding firecrackers , Igo And Tell of Time ! And Tell of Time i g Fand immediately the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signalled to Uncle Matt , who motioned to him , however , to wait and came running up , breathless , as the mules stopped , quivering , in their tracks . Maybe us better take do ole road down to de ferry , Mas ' Lavin , so 's we do n't run into so many soljers . Whut you think ? ' Is it muddy ? ' Cavin inquired , with his mind on the heavily loaded wagons . Wall , dar 's been right smart o ' rain , but don ' many people know ' bout dat road . I ) e Yankees , ' he explained , ' ain ' foun ' it yit . Dey all takes de wide shell road down to de new railroad crossin ' . ' Gavin wrinkled his brow and laughed .

' He hurried to the hack anti then pulled himself up into Cav- in 's wagon , leaning hack against the seat , ready to fall in- stantly asleep when he had gut them on the right road . Lavin took up the lines , and looked at Lucina . Why do n't you wrap up in some of those blankets and go to sleep like Maria ? ' he suggested . The idea ! ' she said . With a moon like this , and everything to look at ! Go on , Lavin . ' I le smiled into her dark eyes , and , sitting back , pulled on the reins . Gid-dap ! ' he called . Gid-dap there , doggone yo ' tough hides ! ' ' Gavin ! ' Lucina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the army , ' he apologized , offering an excuseshe was to grow very familiar with . When the wagons were all in motion and the mules had fallen into the steady jog trot that they could follow uninterruptedly , hour after hour , Cavin slid his arm around Lucina . Here , ' he said , lean back on my shoulder . Pa would have sent the carriage to meet us , if he 'd known I was bringing a pretty young lady home . ' When he looked at her again , she was asleep , with her dark head pressed against John 's gray jacket . And Tell of Time 193Chapter 9IT WAS nearly midnight , Cavin decided , squinting at the stars , before they were across the ferry and on the mainland . It would be long after that time before they could hope to reach the camp site where he planned to rest until some time next day . As they drove onto the shaky ferry , Lucina awoke . At first , as her eyes slowly took in the gleaming water , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm of the bay across which they were passing , she thought she was dreaming , and lay quiet against Cavin 's shoulder , expecting soon to see the familiar walls n1. her room at home taking shape before her . Soon , however. , she realized that she was in a wagon headed for the Brazos , and sitting up , looked anxiously back across the bay toward Galveston , then up at Cavin . Do you suppose they 'll send after us ? ' she inquired . Somehowthe prospect seemed more terrifying to her , as the night wore on . He considered his reply for some time , whistling under his breath as he meditated . No , ' he said finally , I do n't believe there 's a chance , now we 're out of town . I 've been thinking about it as I drove along . ' Shifting the reins from one hand to the other , he began to lay before her the various possibilities he had been canvassing . ' We had just landed , you know . Nobodyin town ever saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stir before daylight , anyway . No , ' he concluded confidently , we 'll never hear any more from it . Are you very tired ? ' he inquired solicitously , and yawned . I am ! I 'd wake up Jake and make him drive , but I want to get where we 're going . ' The ferry creaked and came to rest . They were across the bay at last , and Cavin jumped off the wagon to lead his mules on shore . Then , holding out his arms to Lucina , he said : Hop down . We 'll have to wait here till all the wagons get across . ' They paced back and forth , watching the ferry moving on its cable back across the bay , which , at this point , was hardly wider than a river . Lucina thought how strange it was that she , Lucina Lyttleton , should be here , under the night sky of Texas , walking on a sandy road with a man who , until four months before , she had never thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , stranger yet , she felt no surprise at what she was doing ; she felt that always she had known she would be here , on the white earth flooded with moonlight , walking , with Cavin 's arm around her , to the bend of the road and back . It seemed to her that , if the night never ended , she could live on happily forever in its changeless , eery light . With every sense heightened and alert , she stood listening to the brown grass rattling in the breeze and to small fish jumping in and out the silvery water . As she listened , an enormous w I r i t c bird , aroused by the clatter of the mule team , rose , startled , from the marshes , and , flapping its angular wings , circled upwardover the deserted beach . Lucina followed his curving flight and her eyes stayed fixed on the sky , as Cavin drew her to a fallen tree beside the narrow road marked only by two wheel tracks , with a wide swathe of grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to her , conscious of ' no hurry and no anxiety , filled with a content so deep that they had no need to speak. 194 And Tell of TimeGavin ! ' she exclaimed , struck by the appearance of the sky ; there are n't any stars ! ' She pointed upward to the moon , floating alone , it seemed , in a sea of white and brilliant light . They 'll come out directly , when the moon goes down , ' he assured her . ' On the Gulf , you do n't notice the stars if there 's a moon . There 's one . ' Low toward the horizon , a single flaming sun whirled in space . Intent on their search , they failed to hear Matt approaching . The negro , noticing their absorption , stood waiting , and at last Gavin caught sight of him and stood up . Ready , Uncle Matt ? ' ' Yas-suh . Dey 's all acrost . ' As they started off , Gavin explained to Lucina how , for miles on end , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just keep an eye on ' cm , ' he advised her . You 'll see they wake up if a mule so nun 11 as switches his tail , or steps a foot out o ' line . ' Then he fiolded a blanket and , laying it on the wagon floor between the scat and the front panel , invited her to sit there and rest her back against his knees . As they drove along under the wide night sky , he began telling her what he had been thinking about all summer at Cedar Ledge , what plans he had made for working his Texas land with free labor , what hopes he had for the future . He must have talked fin- an hour , almost without stopping . She listened carefully , but he could see she was faintly troubled . Maybe Uncle Phil wo n't like your bringing home a wife ? ' she suggested . Lavin turned her face up to him and looked at her reproachfully . ' Now you 're talking foolishness . Time you got to bed ! ' He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prairie like a misty blue-white cobweb . ' Here we are , I think . ' And Tell of Time 195He hauled up the mules sharply and leaned further forward , scrutinizing the spot . Yes , there 's the creek , and the lone split pine . Must be , ' he hazarded , looking up at the sky , must be around two o'clock . Sleepy , Sweet ? ' he asked , as he lifted her down from the wagon . Not sleepy , ' she answered , but , my goodness ! I 'm stiff . ' She took a few painful steps and stopped . ' Whatever 's the matter with me ? ' It 's the jolting , ' Gavin told her , knitting his heavy brows . ' Oh ! ' She was relieved . ' Is that all ? ' Lavin threw a blanket around her and folded up another finherto sit on . Lean back against this tree and watch Eph get breakfast . Or maybe it 's supper ? ' he suggested , with his eyes on the other approaching wagons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the prairie , but they came to life at once when the motion ceased . One by one they jumped off the wagons and gathered around Lavin , smiling expansively , their white teeth gleaming in the moonlight . Lawd ! How Mas ' Philip 's boy had growed , they thought , bringing home a wife , too . How Mas ' Philip gon na take it , you rekkin ? they had asked one another , coming across the prairie . Lavin stood waiting for them all to assemble , picking omit the drivers he recognized , as they drew their mules to a halt and , throwing down the heavy irons that held the teams anchored , made their way stiffly toward him . ' I 'm mighty glad to see you all , ' he told them , offering his hand to Uncle Eph , who stood in the forefront . ' Especially UncleEph , ' he continued . ' I been hungry for some o ' his battercakesever since I joined the army . ' Reaching out his arm , he drew Lucina to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' he said to the negroes gathered in front of him , this is your new mistress , Miss Lucina . I expect you all to show her how well Miss Lettie has trained you to wait on her . ' And this is Maria , ' said Lucina , laying her hand on Maria 's arm , and smiling . I 've been hearing about you all the way out here . ' Uncle Eph , ' Cavin suggested briskly , how about starting a batch o ' cakes to frying ? And , Jim , you and Jefferson set up my tent , right away , wo n't you ? Uncle Matt , I suppose you 'll ' tend to the mules ? Jake , you better fell ) him . Who 's this boy ? ' he asked , catching sight of a colored man he had not before noticed . The negro stepped hu ward , pulling off his hat . I'se Job , Miss Lcttic 's hunter , suh , ' he told Cavin . Yo ' pa done got too busy to hunt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Lettie soot nu . along to bring back some game , dis trip . She say she pinin ' fur sonic . ' So'rn I , ' said Gavin enthusiastically . So 'm L ' Soon they began to smell coffee and bacon and wood smoke , and saw Eph flipping battercakes into the air . Cavin sank down beside Lucina , leaning his head against the tree , and clasping his hands around his knees , while Jake brought a seat out of one of the wagons and set it clown in front of them , with a clean towel laid out on it for a tablecloth . Gavin ! ' cried Lucina incredulously . Do I smell coffee ? And is this butter ? ' she demanded , as Maria set a plate of cakes before her . Impossible ! ' Well , Sherman never got to Texas , that 's certain , ' Cavin agreed , lavishly buttering his hot cakes . Thank the Lord , ' he ended . When they had finished , they sat for a time watching the servantsputting up their tent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disconsolately against a tree , and went over to comfort her , while Gavin walked over to a wagon looking for a coil of rope . Finding it , he hung it carelesslyover his arm and dropped it just inside the door of the tent . Then he went over and spoke to Maria , too . Maria , ' he promised her , you 're going to like it here . ' I hope I is , ' she replied , so doubtfully that Lucina had ta laugh . Cavin stood for some time at his tent door looking out at the dying campfire , at the men huddled around it , and at the wagons and the mules gathered to one side . Then he unstrapped his pistols and laid them carefully on the canvas floor beside his pillow . It 's a good thing you 're along , Lucy , ' he remarked , chuckling , or I 'd think I was in the army . ' Then , uncoiling. the rope , he began to lay it neatly around the mattress . Lucina watched him curiously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had seen many strange sights in . Texas , but this was the strangest . Cavin laughed . The rope 's to keep off snakes , ' he explained , . smiling at her expression of startled distaste . Sometimes , this time of year , they 'll crawl in any old place it 's warm . ' He stood looking down at her , his smile broadening . I do n't know whether there is anything in this rope business , ' he admitted , but the cowboys swear a rattler wo n't cross over one . ' Well , ' exclaimed Lucina , sinking back on her pillow . ' I 've a lot to learn . ' Snakes ! All night she dreamed of black , creeping bodies writhing over ropes . When they awoke , it was late morning , and the warm sun . streamed out of a cloudless sky over an expanse of ' tawny grass . that stretched away and away , endlessly Lucina thought , to the round horizon . The prairie was broken here and there in the distance by clumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Time And Tell of Time 199which arose , like oases in a desert , out of bare open space . Lucina'seyes , however , did not linger on these trees . The prairie 's wide loneliness crowded in upon her consciousness , blotting out every other impression . As she watched , the wind swept through the grass , giving it the undulating appearance of the ocean itself , and her the impression that the very ground under her feet was rocking . Detecting salt in the thin bright air blown inward from the Gulf ; she drew a deep breath and , narrowing her eyes , stood watching the light that fell in sparkling brilliance upon the dun and sandy earth . ' I ' 1w whole prairie lay drowsing under such warm and shifting color as she had never seen before . Like light through a prism , the sun 's rays covered the dead grass , breaking against it into every shade of the spectrum . She felt overcome , beaten down by the effulgence that surrounded her . It seemed to her almost unearthly , as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanketed the Georgia valleys in a ' biter , dimmer radiance . She had a momentaryfeeling that she had been set down somewhere on a strange and deserted planet , that she drew into her nostrils air from some old , firsaken world . Yet the sight stimulated her imagination ; and this flat land seemed to her , despite its strangeness , somehow fioniliar and cherished , like something she dimly remembered out of a past so remote that she had almost forgotten it . Lavin , who stood behind her looking out over her shoulder , took an exultant breath , as his eyes fell on the open prairie . Lucina leaned against him and began to speak slowly , trying to put into words her half-firrmcd thoughts . I know why you feel the way you do about this country , ' she began . It 's  --  well , it 's mysterious . It makes you shiver , like a dream that you keep dreaming over and over at night  --  a dream in which everything is new and strange and , yet , old too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lavin said , delighted with her immediate understandingof what he had always felt but could never express . That 's it , exactly . How do you know everything you do , Sweet ? ' Oh , ' she replied lightly , I read it in your mind . ' He laughed and released her , throwing a warm glance at the endless prairie sky , unbroken by mountains or forests . Eph 's carried out Pa 's orders never to wake anybody up , short of fire or murder . It must be time for dinner , not break-fast ! ' The scent of burning wood drifted toward them , and the aroma of browning meat . Well , ' Lucina responded , whatever it is , I want some . ' Lavin followed her to the fire , where Eph was anxiously inspecting a hollow in the ground banked with leaves and ashes , and heaped over with red coals . Mawnin ' , suh , ' the negro said , looking up from his work . I was mighty worried fur fear you would n't wake up befo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoe cakes all burnt up . ' Lifting his black face , he leaned back , squatting on his heels , while an expression of triumph rose in his one good eye . Derv 's some preserved figs , ' he announced proudly . Miss Lettie soot ' em along fur you to eat wid yo ' breakfus , an ' I picked up some collards an ' turnips in de market yestiddy in town . I ai n't gwine let Miss Lucy git hongry , ' he announced , rising and bowing to Lucina . You 'll spoil me , Uncle Eph , ' Lucina answered , dropping down on the blanket before the wagon seat that she saw was again to serve as a table . How 'd you get the prairie chicken , Uncle 1 ; plr ? ' Lavin inquired , holding out his hand for a plate . I did n't hear any shots . ' 200 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 2or'Nam suh , we did n't wants to wakes you all up . Matt sont Jim out , quick 's he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ' here ' t is , ' he added , holding the bird , stripped of its clay covering , up to view . As they ate , they could hear the drivers gathered some distanceaway around their own campfire , talking and laughing , and the hobbled mules munching their way through the rustling grass . Around them , small , brilliantly colored birds rose on fluttering wings from the thick-matted blackberry bushes that followed the creek 's course a little distance away . Redbirds and wild canaries , ' Gavin told Lucina , pointing them out to her , and sec that dull , gray bird amongst them ? You never saw anything iii your lifi ) fly so high as that little bird , ' he laughed . ' We 've another funny bird here  --  no bigger'n a minute , but it 'll tackle ; i hawk and get the best of it , too . I used to lie in the grass and watch ' em fight through Pa 's field glasses . ' There ; ire all kinds of ' snakes and ants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , besides , ' he said , eagerly drawing on his pleasant boyhood memories , unconscious of her shrinking . Come on , ' he said , rising briskly and pulling her up beside him . Let 's go take a v ; tlk dliile Matt 's hitching up . ' He stood still , eyeing her with a gleam of amusement in his lively eyes . Bet you never saw a sensitive plant that folds up if you touch it , or a plant that eats flies ? Or a tree whose bark 'll cure your toothache ? Or '  - -  -  he grinned  --  a cactus that grows pears and nuts on it ? ' h'or an hour they walked along the creek bed , resting here and there on fallen logs , while they watched vultures circling and dipping , under a sky so wide and blue that it was almost black . ' Look ! ' said Cavin , suddenly noticing a flower that grewjust out of reach of his hand . Here 's one o ' the plants I was telling you about . ' It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its pansylikered blossom studded thickly with tiny hairs tipped with drops of sticky dew . Moving closer , Cavin dropped his finger in its centre , and the petals curled quickly around it . Gosh ! It has a grip , ' he cried , as delighted with its behavior as when he first had tested out its curious , tensile strength . Watch it ; it 'll let go in a minute , soon as it finds out I 'm not a fly . ' Does it hurt ? ' she asked , watching the leaves unfold . Oh , no , ' he answered ; try it . ' But when she did , her delicate skin turned fiery red and burned as though it had been blistered . You have to get used to this country . I see that , ' she told him , as they returned to camp . Even the flowers bite you ! ' Ahead of them , the six wagons stood in line with Matt in the front driver 's seat . Cavin tucked Lucina 's hand inside his arm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pretty tough going , as I remember it , ' he said . You just have to cut across the prairie , and hope you do n't run into a bog hole . Wish I had some boots . ' With a lugubrious grin , he held out his foot for I.ucina to look at . Imagine what 'll happen to those contraptions if we strike deep mud ! ' Uncle Matt had been worrying about the same contingency . Sometimes , he meditated , Mas ' Philip sent into town fin- a soft pair of new boots , hand sewed and turned hoots finely traced in red , with tops as pliable as silk , and heels as red as the tracery . Lawd Jesus ! Would n't it be just right , now , if there happened to be a pair like that in the wagon ? Maybe Mas ' Cavin could wear his pa 's boots ! Patiently , he felt around. 202 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 203among the various parcels , until at last he came upon what he was searching for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his black face , he laid the boots out in Cavin 's wagon . My Gosh-amighty ! ' Cavin exclaimed , when he saw them . Talk about answers to prayer ! ' With a little padding in the toes , they fitted fairly well , and all afternoon he lay back in the wagon , lifting his foot from time to time to gaze , like a child , at his brand-new boots . They had not yet reached the part of the  --  route that was hard going , so he had little to do but rest and call Lucina 's attention to things she should notice as t hey moved slowly along across the monotonousplain . Toward evening , the whole prairie began again to reflect the shilling tints of the sky ; and suddenly the yellow crimson light passed into , e quick and settling dark . A little later , as they sat under the pines waiting for supper , the moon rose , a golden disk , out of ' the edge 01 ' the world . They ate their boiled eggs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glow from the fire playing over them . Cavin 's hand groped for Lucina 's . I do n't want a thing in this world , do you ? ' She laughed softly . I ca n't think of a thing ! ' Then , as they sat there , they heard a slow humming from the servants ' camp , and saw the drivers approaching through the trees . Jim held a jews-harp to his lips and Eph a comb , with its teeth wrapped in tissue paper . Jefferson was carrying a banjo , on which he strummed lightly as he walked . Behind them were the other drivers , all humming in a deep , resonant chorus . Eph stepped forward and addressed Cavin diffidently , his old , stooped body etched against the flames , and his single eye giving him a weird , Cyclops-like appearance . Mas ' Gavin , ' he said , shuffling his feet , us thought maybe you and our young mistis might lak a little song and dance . ' Fine ! ' Cavin responded heartily . Fine ! Go ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that , as a boy , he had often tried in vain to imitate Uncle Eph 's skill . As he spoke , Uncle Eph began to play a slow , haunting tune on the fine teeth of the comb , expertly bending it toward one angle or another , and his head with it . The sound was at one moment like the rustling of leaves or the movement of dried grass , at another like the whirling of water in a small pool . Then Jim joined in with his mournful jews-harp , and , a little later , Jefferson struck up his tinkling banjo . Almost immediately all the men began a low humming , which rose at the end to a magnificent crescendo that left Lucina breathless , filled with some deep , aching pity , for what she could not tell . Then two of the drivers began to clog to the rhythmic clappingof the others ' hands and to the strumming of the banjos , their figures moving like shadows back and forth in front of the fire , as they followed minutely the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how late it was growing until they stopped , breathing hard and bowing elaborately . Well , ' said Gavin heartily , rising , that was a fine show . Uncle Eph , I 'll have to get you to give me some more lessons . ' He smiled at Jim and Jefferson . Why do n't you all see what you can do about showing Jake some o ' yo ' tricks ? ' Lucina slid her hand in his , and they walked slowly over to their tent , standing for some time in front of it watching the light on the prairie and listening , In the warm night , to the soft scuffling sounds of birds and rabbits in the thick grass . All her days , she was to remember those few moments , when life seemed to her to lie out in front of her as clear and plain as204 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 205the vast prairie that stretched before her eyes , flooded with moonlight and sunk in a strange , fathomless peace . Some time later , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ howled and tore at the tent , and , shivering , heard above that sound a chorus of long , penetrating wails rising and sinking , rising and sinking again . It seemed to her that all the sorrow and suffering in the world was condensed and expressed in the dreary , dismal cries that echoed endlessly over the wild and vacant land . What could it be ? The noise sounded like nothing so much as the weeping of banshees that she had heard described by old mountain women , or like the wailing of ghosts who , the negroes said , deserted their peaceful graves every year on the eve before All Saints ' Day . She lay petrified by fear , too frightened to move , and then she heard rain falling , in violent gusts , upon the roof of the tent , and again , above the rain and the wind , the long , mournful cries coming , it seemed , from some soul beyond the reach of pity . Never in any nightmare had she experienced the terror that possessed her as she heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sounds that had awakened her . The wind grew to such intensity that it roused Cavin , who usually slept indifferent to almost any disturbance , and Lucina asked him , in a voice that quivered and shook , what the noise was . He had heard only the rain , but , as he listened , there floated over the prairie again the long , shrieking wails that had terrified Lucina . Oh , ' he chuckled , coyotes out running before the wind . They 'll probably carry on like that till daylight . ' Arc they dangerous ? ' she asked him , feeling flow through her , at his touch , the same happy security that always overtook her as a child , when , after a bad dream , she opened her eyes to feel her mother 's arms around her . Dangerous ! ' he laughed . To calves ! Hear that norther ! ' he said , drawing the blankets tighter . I hope the rain lets up before daylight . ' But it was five days before it stopped , five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men put on slickers and got the wagons started , raising hoops and canvas over several of them , and spreading tarpaulin over the rest . The rain fell in a steady drizzle , and the air was so damp that Lucina 's hair dripped moisture . She could hear the mules ' feet splashing in the wet , where a sheet of cold water lay over the prairie ; and all day long she listened to the sucking sound of the wheels as they pulled in and out the sticky soil . Sometimes the wagons sank up to their hubs in mud , and then Cavin and the negroes would have to get down in the rain and unload the pine branches which Gavin , anticipating the difficulties ahead , had had the men cut and pile into the back wagon . Running these under the wheels that were stuck fast , the drivers would crack their long black whips , and usually the mules , hearing the sound , would pull and strain until the wheels were loose . Sometimes , though , Cavin would have to order the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team that could no longer move . So , by slow degrees , they made their way across the dismal prairie , with the rain falling and the cold , wet wind forcing its way into every open crack . Maybe we ought to stop and make camp till it blows over ? ' Lucina asked one night , as Cavin entered , dripping , into the covered wagon where she was sitting , with Maria huddled close beside her . Trouble is , you never know how long it 'll last , ' he replied . No , I think we 'd better keep on . If you can stand it ? ' He threw a commiserating glance in her direction. 206 And Tell of TimeI ? ' she responded in a surprised tone . Why , of course ! But I do n't see how you manage , out in the rain ! ' He sat down , eyeing her with a slow , amused smile . How do you suppose they kept me nice and warm and comfortable in the army ? ' he asked her . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the pot that was brewing on the brazier in the wagon , and adding a ration of rum to his own portion . How you making out , Maria ? ' he asked the negro girl , sipping his hot drink in satisfaction . I 'd be shamed to complain , ern Miss Lucy do n't , ' she told him primly , and Cavin threw his head back and laughed at her unhappy face . Never mind , Maria , ' Lucina consoled her . Nothing lasts forever . ' She was surprised herself that she minded the shaking and the jolting , the wind and the dampness so little . It all seemed part of some large drama being enacted around her that she watched , rather than shared  --  watched with the keenest interest . She would peer for hours , out of the slit in her wagon , at the long-horned cattle standing hunched together in the opaque mist , with their tails between their legs and their necks drawn back into their shoulders , as if to present as little body surface as possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking almost like wax figures , would drift along in one direction , seemingly pushed by the wind . Days later , when the weather was again mild and warm , Lucina was amazed to see the agility with which these enormous beasts moved , and the eager attention with which they raised their heads and stared across the grass at the approaching wagons . Watching them , in the slow rain , she had no impression of the ferocity that later she was to learn often distinguished them . Peeping through the slit , she also noticed droves of wildAnd Tell of Time 207horses standing huddled together with water running off their tangled manes and tails . Every now and then a deer with antlers would flash by ; or prairie chickens and wild turkeys , disturbed by the passing wagons , would fly agitatedly into the air , squawking as they settled again on the ground , or on some lone tree or shrub . Sometimes it seemed to Lucina that they had been pushing on like this , in wind and cold rain , ever since they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life would be spent in this endless procession leading nowhere , it seemed . For they passed no houses or settlements ; and the wet prairie looked yesterday exactly as it did today , and would , she supposed , tomorrow . Eventually it cleared , as suddenly as the storm had fallen ; and that day they paused , made camp , and dried out their belongings , enjoying a better meal than any they had had since the outset of the rain . Six days out , ' remarked Cavin at supper that night . How many miles do you think we 've made , Uncle Eph ? ' The negro was carrying a plate of hot corn dodgers and a platter of birds wrapped around with bacon , which he had roasted in a black skillet set over the coals , and their brown and succulent appearance pleased him mightily . Taking another approving glance at them , he offered them , with a proud flourish , to Lucina . Lawd ! Uncle Eph ! ' Cavin exclaimed , you 're the best cook twixt here and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the prairie , which offered so few landmarks . Where are we ? ' he inquired again . I 've kind-a forgotten the way . ' See dat-ar row of trees yonder ? ' Uncle Eph pointed to a shadowy black strip ahead . Us ought-a git dar tomorrow , or maybe next day . That 's some less'n half way . ' It 'll take us about two weeks in all , then , ' Gavin calculated. 208 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 209Well , ' Uncle Eph responded prudently , I do ' know , suh . Mebbe , mebbe not . Us most generally makes it in dat time , but we 's had a streak o ' wedder dis trip , an ' I specks dar 'll be a powerful heap of mud twist heah an ' de Brazos . Dar too , ' he added , grinning . There was no more rain , not until the last day , but the ground was wet and sticky and progress slow and halting . Lucina might have thought the last stretch monotonous if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a cotton-tail rabbit which they intended to cook in a stew to be eaten with lye hominy . She was so much amused by the little creature 's blinking eyes and its absurd white tuft of a tail , that she would not let Uncle Eph have it and took it for a pet . Soon she and Maria had it eating out of their hands , and , as they played with it , the hours passed and another day was gone . As Lucina jolted across the flat prairie , it seemed to her that she was existing in some separate section of time and space , into which the ordinary cares and duties of life did not enter , and that these days , from the beginning of her life , had been set apart for her to pass through . She felt like a traveller on a train who , for the time being , is removed by his passage through space from any temporal demands ; and she understood that , as long as she travelled in this creaking , jolting wagon , she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be almost its sole occupants . Now , at least , they could move as they pleased regardless of other people , or of a government that , at Galveston , had seemed to them insupportable and intolerable . But at last they emerged from the open plain into a different region altogether  --  a region full of sprawling trees , enormous in width , heavily laden with moss and mistletoe , and Lucina observed , looking at the ground , that it was no longer gray , filled with shell , or white and sandy , but a deep , rich black , a loam going down , Cavin told her , so deep they had never reached its bottom with any plow . For , he explained , an overflow of the Brazos , while disastrous in its immediate effects , in the long run replenished the soil so well that it had never been necessary to use fertilizer on his father 's place . And the millions of leaves that fell annually kept the ground loose and pliable . Pa wrote to my mother , ' Cavin remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " lovely and fertile , with water and pasture for cattle and with deep soil for cotton and sugar cane . " ' The words rolled over his tongue almost automatically , coming , Lucina realized , out of the depths of some old memory that she did not as yet share with him . They were following the turns of a yellow river that flowed in and around sand banks in its bed , on and on , in monstrous curves , to its wide and gaping end . On each side of the river great cypress trees extended their huge and groping roots out into the river that flowed over them , indifferent to their presence . This is n't a bit like the prairie , ' Lucina commented . It 's the river bottom , ' Cavin explained , and there 's no better land anywhere . ' He threw out his hand to the river . ' Look at it , running along there as peaceful as you please . But you ought to see it when it goes on a rampage . The Spani aids who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they wa t ( lied its capers , but in the spring you 'd think it belonged to the devil . They say , though , ' he smiled at his bride , if you once drink out of it , there 's a spell on you so you can never leave these bottoms . Well , ' he sighed comfortably and stretched his long legs out in front of him , mighty few ever do want to leave . It grows on you , somehow ; you 'll see . Stop , Jake , ' he ordered . I want Miss Lucina to see the woods along here . ' 210 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 2I1Snakes ? ' she questioned fearfully . Spiders ? ' Hesitantly she put her foot down on the crunching leaves , and followed him . There 's a live-oak grove I want you to look at , ' he told her , nothing but live-oaks , bigger than any trees you ever saw anywhere . ' A little further on he came to a dead stand , looking down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mad-dog tree ! ' he exclaimed . The tree I climbed , the day a mad dog got after me . ' He stood staring at it . There 's been war , and surrender , and everything else going on , and here 's that very tree , still here by the side of the road ! ' He blinked at her , for a moment feeling time move mysteriously around him , and then , shrugging his shoulders , went on . And here , ' he continued , picking her up and setting her down in a grapevine swing , here is the vine I used to hang onto and try to touch the top of that tallest tree yonder . See ? Want me to push you ? ' he asked , giving her a light shove . Not that high , ' she begged him , as she began to sway , going higher and higher , until he could easily run beneath her and catch her on the return . She jumped out of the swing into his arms , and he gave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its tart flavor remindedher of their childhood , when they had kept their pockets filled with grape leaves , munching on them all day . He stood looking around him , happy to be at last on his own ground . There are wild grapes and wild plums , too , in these woods , ' he told her , and all kinds of persimmons , and dewberries , and blackberries , and thorn-apples , and pecans , and walnuts , and I do n't know what all . ' Gesturing magnificently , with a wide swing of his arms , he observed , The Lord never intended for anybody to go hungry in Texas . ' Whose land is all this ? ' she asked him , remarking that someof the foliage , even in the warm autumn , was beginning to shrivel . Lavin told her that the live-oaks and the holly trees , the cedars , and the graceful rounded haws kept their leaves all winter , changing their color during the colder season from a lighter shade to a green so dark it was almost black ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed insensible to climate , were by Christmas standing stark and bare along creeks filled with still , brown water . And , then , she asked him again whose land they were on . Ours , ' he answered absently . Ours . We 've been travelling on it since early this morning . As soon as we hit the road back there , we were on it . ' He was studying a clearing filled with black stumps . They ought to all be pulled up . That 's tough work , though , ' he told her . His eyes roamed over the fields , and Lucina knew that he was planning some particular task , overcoming its difficulties in thought , before he undertook to do so in fact . Soon , however , his face lighted up and he began to try to tell her how the bottom land looked in spring , when the ground was covered with violets and white Mayflowers and with sweet-smelling shrubs borne down with blossoms , when the locusts and the red buds , the magnolias and crepe myrtles were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dewberries crept lushly along the ground . Then it came to him that , after all , there was no need to try to describe to her what she would be seeing with her own eyes in a few months . The thought brought him a sudden sharp satisfaction . He had only to stretch out his hand and , forevermorenow , there would be Lucina . I ' 11 bring you back down here in the spring , ' he promised her happily , picking her up and carrying her , high over the tangled bushes and damp ground , back toward the wagon. 212 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 213Gavin , put me down ! ' she remonstrated . But he did not pause until they were almost out of the trees . That 's to show you you 'd better not ever try running away from me , ' he warned her , in mock ferocity , as she lay limp and laughing against him . Do you suppose I 'm likely to want to ? ' she asked him , amused at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standing there in the circle of his arms , listening to the river flowing through the quiet woods , she felt again the certainty that had come over her the morning she sat waiting for him in the tree at Cedar Ledge . He dropped his cheek on hers , and they stood there without moving , unconscious of the restless movements of the teams halted on the road close by . No , Sweet , ' he replied gently , I do n't think you are going to want to leave me . But , ' with a sudden change of mood , it would n't do you any good if you did ! Come on ! If we 're going to get home by dark , we 'll have to hurry . ' Taking her hand , he led her through the tall berry bushes that screened the road to the waiting wagons . It was  --  Cavin glanced quickly at the sun  --  probably four o'clock . They jolted and bumped along the winding road all the rest of the afternoon , making slow and tortuous progress through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past week . For even though it had been clear for a week or more , the rains did not quickly drain off this flat , heavy soil . Toward dusk , the road dipped into a slough . Lucina shuddered as she glanced down at the black water which still stood well above the ooze in which the mules struggled , and hoped she would never have to put her own foot into it . Dark fell long before they were clear of the mire . Uncle Matt lighted a lantern and went ahead , with his hand on the bridle of the mules hitched to the hone wagon . Then the rain began to fall , in a slow , steadydrizzle , which , already Lucina knew , could keep up for days on end , in this coastal country . Cavin buttoned his slicker around her , and threw a blanket over his own shoulders . Almost there now , ' he said . No use trying to put up the top . See that light through the trees ? A little further and we turn into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they had entered the lane , their wheels once again rolled into a deep mud hole . One of the mules lay down in his traces and refused , even at the crack of the whip , to budge , and the wagons behind drew up with a loud clatter . The noise penetrated Philip 's office , where , since supper , he had been sitting , going over his experiments . Grabbing the lantern he had used to light his way from the house to his office , he threw a long yellow slicker around him , and , guessing at once what the commotion meant , started hurriedly off down the lane , the light bobbing against his thin knees . His riding horse , he remembered , had stumbled in that hole a few days before . Damn my carelessness , ' he thought irascibly , I ought to have had that place filled in . I ca n't seem to get around to doing all I ought to . Now , I knew when Pilot stepped in that hole that it had to be fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furrie  --  d , angry with himself and resentful of the lassitude that , more and more often , overtook him . For the moment , having long ago become accustomed to Cavin 's absence , he forgot lie was expectinghis son home on the wagon-train . He reached the mud hole and took in the situation . It was after nine o'clock and raining ; it would probably rain all night . They could not hope to get all the wagons pulled past the hole now , in the dark , with exhausted teams in the traces . He made his decision quickly. 214 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 215Matt , ' he said quickly , not taking time to ask about the trip , tell the men to unhitch and be sure to cover up the supplies . Then you better go tell Aunt Emmy to make you all some hot coffee and issue dry clothes , all around . Here , ' he fumbled in his pocket , give her the key to the storeroom . I do n't want you all turning up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get along ? ' he asked , almost as an afterthought , as he came closer , edging his way around the hole . Fine , ' said Cavin , coming to meet him and throwing his arms around his father . Fine , Pa ! ' Philip held him off with one hand and raised his lantern , scanning his son 's face . My God-a-mighty , boy ! For the minute , I 'd forgot you were coming ! ' He put down his lantern and seized Cavin 's hands . Arc you well ? ' Laughing , he ran his hand up his son 's sleeve until he touched his shoulder and saw that it was level with his own . I was looking for a boy , and here you are , tall as I am ! ' Well , I reckon it 's about time I was , ' said Cavin , shaking his father 's hands and gazing cheerfully at him in the flickering lantern light . Full time , because I 've brought home a wife ! ' A what ? ' Philip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectation . A wife , Pa , ' repeated Cavin . I do n't blame you for being surprised . I was myself ; ' he admitted , his eyes twinkling . His father thought suddenly as he watched him , There 's something  --  what is it ?  --  something about the boy that 's like Mary ? ' Where is she ? ' Philip demanded . Cavin ! Are you serious ? ' Certainly , Pa , I 'm serious . And here she is , ' Cavin said , moving over to the wagon and holding out his arms to Lucina . I hope you do n't mind , Uncle Phil , ' said Lucina , in a small , shaky voice , as Cavin handed her over bodily to Philip . Again Philip took up his lantern , throwing its beams full on Lucina 's face , holding her to him with one arm while he studied her features  --  her mouth , a little too wide for the delicate chin beneath it , her black , shining hair . I 'm Lucina , ' she told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyttleton . ' Mary 's niece ? ' Philip asked in astonishment , and saw as he looked at her that she was . Well , I declare ! But I 'd have recognized those big eyes anywhere ! ' he said , and pinched her cheek . Cavin , how did you ever persuade this sweet child to accept you ? ' he demanded . I hope we can make you happy , my dear . ' Gavin , ' he said , turning to his son , any woman puts a man eternally in her debt by marrying him ! You 've got to remember that ! ' Smiling down at Lucina , he stooped to kiss her . This is a mighty muddy lane . We 're going to carry you into the house , young lady . ' Letitia was sitting at her piano , when she heard steps on the gallery . Hurrying to the door , she opened it and stood there framed in the yellow light , with her blue dress blowing about her and her light hair standing out , like a nimbus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she cried ; and a moment later they stood in the lighted hall , with the water running off them in rivulets to the floor . Why , Cavin ! I 'm so glad you are back ! And -  --  ' She turned expectantly toward Lucina . My wife , ' said Cavin , smiling . My wife , Lucina . I 've been telling her about you , Letitia . ' Letitia was as startled as Philip had been . She put her arm around Lucina 's waist and looked at her searchingly , remarking with a sudden uprise of emotion , how young she was. 216 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 217 Wife , Cavin , did you say ? ' she said aloud , kissing Lucina 's cold cheek . Why , you had just left off flying kites when you went to war ! And here you come home with a bride ! ' She smiled at Lucina , who , she felt certain , must be wet and tired . Philip , ' Letitia said briskly to her husband , would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some dry clothes and a toddy ? I expect Lucina could stand a glass of wine herself , and a hot bath , and bed . Could n't you ? ' she asked , feeling a sudden tenderness arise in her as she turned toward Lucina . Once , years and years ago , she had been as young as this child . Lucina glanced at the hall , with its wide board floors , and at the long gilded mirror , with four candlesticks attached , that hung on the bare , wide wall . ' That would be pleasant , ' she confessed , realizing all at once , that she was exhausted . Philip and Cavin 'll be discussing crops and the state of the country in a minute ! ' Letitia predicted . You come along with me , Lucina . ' Maria ! ' Lucina cried , hesitating . I must see what she 's doing . My maid , ' she explained to Letitia . She 's all right , ' Cavin answered . I told Jake to take her around to Aunt Emmy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' He looked toward Letitia with an apologetic smile . This trip 's upset Maria more than it has Lucina . Maybe you could put her in with Aunt Emmy , ' he suggested . I 'll put her in with Callie , my own maid , and fix up some way for Lucina to call her when she needs her , ' Letitia replied . I always tap three times , ' she said , handing Lucina a small bronze bell , to tell Callie I want her . You arrange something with Maria . ' Do n't think it 'll stay this damp and cold , ' she remarked as they moved off . It may be hot tomorrow , hot as summer . Ihope you 'll be comfortable and get a good rest tonight , ' she added , opening the door to a room where Maria was standing in front of a small fire warming her mistress 's damp nightgown on the fender . When Lucina lay warm in her bed , Maria , looking happier than she had in days , brought her in a glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some cold chicken , flanked by hot buttered biscuits . Us is gwine to like it here , ai n't we , Miss Lucy ? ' she asked at once , her eyes shining gently . Does you need any mo ' tonight ? Ef n yo ' do n't , Jake say he gwine-a make me acquainted wid de servants . ' No , Maria , ' said Lucina . Thank you . I do n't need anything more . Just open that window , though , before you go , will you , and pick me one of the leaves off the tree ? That one , I think , ' she said , indicating the window closest her bed . Lawzee ! Whut on earth , Miss Lucy ? Is you gone plum ' crazy ? ' began Maria , puzzled , but doing as she was told . Here ' t is . Still wet as all get-out , ' she grumbled , handing Lucina the leaf . I'se mighty glad we ai n't sleeping out in dem waggins tonight , ai n't you ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fig leaf and handed it back to Maria . I knew it , ' she said , falling back on her pillows . Throw it in the fire , Maria . ' And Tell of Time 219Chapter ToAFTER Letitia and Lucina had left them , Cavin and Philip sank into padded rocking-chairs on each side of the dining-room hearth , where tonight there was a snapping blaze . You feel the first norther , ' said Philip , glancing keenly at his son , his lace taking on the withdrawn watchfulness that characterized it at a patient 's bedside  --  a gathering of all his senses to ascertain what manner of man and ailment he was dealing with . Then he struck a bell that brought a little negro girl running in from the kitchen to answer it . Ask Uncle Matt to bring in the toddies right away , will you , Milly ? ' Philip directed her . Then as she turned to go , he stopped her . ' Tell him to bring along a plate of sandwiches too . ' The boy was tired and cold  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur thinner than he ought to be . Cavin , who was ordinarily ready to sleep early , was tonight as wakeful as Philip . The anxiety that he had been able to lull in Georgia had sprung to life in Galveston ; and now he was beginning to feel more and more anxious about the kind of existence that he had asked Lucina to share . This was an attitude that she never fully understood . From the beginning of their life in Texas , Cavin put her aside , as it were , in a secure corner in his mind , and applied himself to building around her a community fit for her to live in . Evento himself ; he never put this idea into words , but all his life he was unconsciously affected by it . Like a craftsman who designs a jewel case , with little thought for the diamonds it may contain , so , from the beginning , Cavin set his mind , not on Lucina , but on the circumstances that surrounded her . How , he felt rather than reasoned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and alien military rule ? Well , Cavin , ' Philip remarked , leaning back in his chair and carefully cradling his pipe 's ivory bowl in his palm while he gazed at his son , we have to get acquainted , it seems . ' Matt , entering the dining-room at that moment , laid some pieces of fat kindling on the fire and drew a round table with a fluted edge directly in front of the hearth . On it he placed a small silver bowl containing several whole lemons boiled in thick sugary syrup the color of amber  --  a preparation always on hand in Philip 's house . Then he set a bottle of rum on the table , a silver pitcher of hot water , a saucer of cloves , and two julep cups with long spoons in them . He had slipped on the white coat that always hung behind the kitchen door and stood , with a bootjack in hand , waiting for a pause in the conversation . Standing there , with his head thrown up , in a gesture reminiscentof Philip 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kneeling before his master 's outstretched feet , changed his boots to crocheted slippers . I told Jake I 'd take keer o ' you , too , Mas ' Cavin , ' he said , turning to Cavin . Cavin glanced at his father , and laughed . Good thing you sent in to Galveston for some boots , Pa , ' he remarked , holding out his foot to Matt . These are your new ones . ' Ile looked down at the muddy , worn leather , and then up again at his father . I 've been wearing skins on my feet , ' he explained , and grinned . They 're all the style in Georgia . I had to borrow a220 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 221pair o ' boots to get married in . I reckon they were the only pair in the county , too . ' Yes , I know , ' said Philip . I was down to hides myself , towardthe end . ' He looked Cavin over from head to toe , observinghis mud-soaked uniform . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not an extra pair of pants in my closet . ' Matt came back with them in his hands . Dey could stan ' a pressin ' , ' he remarked critically . I 'll sen " em in by Jake when he stahts yo ' fiah in de mawnin ' , Mas ' Cavin . ' What 's Jake up to , anyway ? ' Cavin inquired , reaching over to mix himself a toddy , and raising his feet comfortably up on the fender . Here , son ! ' said Philip , staying Cavin 's hand and offering him a drink already prepared . My compliments , and welcome home ! ' Ile smiled across the cup . Yes , this was Mary 's boy all right . Ile knew just how he felt , young and a bridegroom . It seemed no tin  --  at all since he was that age himself . How little lie knew then  --  how little ! Sometimes he thought the more a man learned , though , the less happy he was . Like Adam , he smiled . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find it 's bitter fruit . He kept his eyes on his son , and his thoughts sealed inside his lips . Strange , he thought , that light yellow hair on the boy 's head . His grandfather 's , Mary had always said . This heredity business had lots of queer kinks in it . A man 's a fool who thinks lw knows too much , he meditated . It 's a pity he ca n't keep on feeling the way he does tonight , all his life  --  just the way he does tonight , ' thought Philip sorrowfully , gazing on his son . Matt stepped forward and mixed a cup for Philip . One for you , too , Matt , ' Philip said absently , stirring togethera pungent drink like his own and holding it out to hisservant , who bowed in gratitude and then stood erect , holding the cup , hot and untouched , in his hand . Never , in the years he had served Philip , had he ever poured out a drink for himself in his master 's presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever in his life drunk his potion before he retired to the kitchen . Will dar be any mo ' tonight , suh ? ' he asked , addressing Philip . No , thank you , Matt , I think not . ' Matt , ' Gavin halted him , as he was turning to go , you tell Jake if he 's not on hand early in the morning , I 'll break his trifling neck . ' Yas suh , I 'll tell ' im , ' the negro replied . I hopes you bofe rests well , ' he added from the door , closing it noiselessly as he went out . I do n't know what I 'd a done if you had n't sent me Jake , ' Gavin remarked , as Matt withdrew . You know , Pa , that nigger could rassle a meal out o ' air . I reckon I 'd have starved if he had n't been around  --  plain starved . Mighty nigh did anyhow , ' he said , taking an appreciative sip of his toddy . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking . Once he told me it was crow , and after that I quit asking . It 's curious , ' he said , lowering his cup and fastening his eyes meditatively on his father , mighty curious , when you think about it . The Yankees started the war to free the niggers , they say , and , now the war 's over , but Matt and Jake are just exactly whet t hey were when the fighting began . ' He shook his head , puzzled . What difference on earth can freedom make to them ? ' Philip set his cup down on the table , and , leaning over , poked the fire till it flared up and threw a rich glow over his and Cavin 's faces . You know , I 've thought that a thousand times , ' he said222 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 223slowly . And that 's exactly what William Charlton said when he refused to vote for secession in the Texas legislature . He said it all through the war , too , although he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fighting once began . ' He was silent for some time staring into the fire . Then he roused himself and continued . God knows , ' he added wearily , it 's hard for any man to set another free , or make him a slave either , when it comes down to it . Freedom 's not a thing you can pass around like a basket of apples , the way the Yankees seem to think . It 's nothing you can give to anybody ; it 's what every man alive has to want , and take , and keep , for himself . Is n't that so , Cavin ? ' He fixed his thoughtful eyes on his son , but it was plain he expectedno answer , that he was thinking aloud . Besides , ' he went on , what 's one man 's freedom is another man 's slavery in this world . Now , you take all those shoe factories they 're building up north . Do n't you suppose Matt would feel more of a slave in one of them than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pleases ? ' Leaning over he tapped his pipe sharply against the inside of the hearth , and , as he did so , the firelight flamed against his face , bringing out his sharp nose , the deep hollows in which his eyes were sunk , the high plane of his cheeks , and his straight eyebrows , which lifted noticeably upward where they joined his temples . Straightening himself , he sat leaning slightly forward with an ironical smile on his thin lips . Yet , ' he went on , that 's what we 're all willing to die for  --  to stay free ! And not one of us knows what freedom means for anybody , white or black . ' He stopped and gravely studied his son . You 've been fighting , boy , when you ought to have been at your books . You 'll need ' em to lean on , too , as the years go on . Well , ' he sighed , you 've learned what life is like , anyway , and that 's all booklearningcan teach you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it knocks you down , as it will . Still , ' he meditated , it 's comforting to read what somebody like you , thousands of years before you were born , thought about problems like your own . Sometimes identically like your own , too , ' he said , setting his cup down , clasping his hands behind his head , and putting his feet up beside Cavin 's on the high brass fender . Now , take Horace , ' he went on ; that old Roman had thought a lot about freedom , as was natural in the child of a man who was n't freeborn . Or Plato . Plato had no illusions at all  --  he knew there are mighty few men fit to bear the burdens that freedom calls for . ' Feeling inside his coat he shook his head . I thought I had my Horace here in my pocket . Must be out in my saddlebags . ' Going into the hall , he returned with a small , scarred brownleatherbook in his hand . Then , turning up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the centre of the dining-room table , he laid the thin volume open , running his finger up and down the lines as he turned the pages . Here , ' he said , here is what Horace says makes a man a slave  --  Listen ! ' He began to translate . Who , then , is free ? The wise man who is master of himself , whom poverty or death finds unafraid , who scorns unworthy ambition . Closing the book , he took his seat again . The Prayer Book speaks of service that is perfect freedom , does n't it ? I serve my country , or my creditors , or my family , do n't I ? Matt serves me , Jake you . Horace is right . Who is free ? I do n't know . ' And yet , Cavin '  --  he stood up and began to pace agitatedly back and forth across the space in front of the hearth , with his long fingers interlaced behind him . Man 's an unreasonable fool . Just the sight of one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Time 225sent out to police this county riles me to a point where I stop thinking . ' Suddenly he stood still , studying Cavin 's passive form , while a deepening despair settled over his own features . It looks , ' he observed slowly , as though the Yankees intend to enslave us now , in place of the poor darky . God knows why they think that 'll improve matters any ! ' He stood so long silent , staring at his son , that Cavin at last urged him on . With a start , he shrugged his shoulders lightly and began to speak again , in a tired , remote voice . If we 'd had any support at Richmond , we might have rallied the Western armies  --  Oh ! well , no use talking about that now , ' he dismissed the idea gloomily . Maybe it would n't have worked out anyway . When they gave out the order in Texas , late in May , for the soldiers to reassemble in Houston , nobody turned up but a kw officers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their own supply depots . ' his expression was like that which always flooded his face whenever he met with an illness he could not cure . Why did the Creator make men subject to pain and frailty ? he always asked himself angrily on those occasions , as he did now . Shrugginghis shoulders again , as though to shake off a persistent gadfly , he went on . Some say they intended to join the French there , but nobody knows . Even Governor Murrah scuttled across the border . And those who stayed at home have mighty strange advice to offer . J ust look at this letter from John Reagan , for example  --  and he was in our cabinet ! Have you seen it ? It 's here in one of the papers . ' He got up and went over to a black iron safe in the corner , where a stack of papers lay folded together . Ile stood scanning them hurriedly , till he found what he wanted . Listen ! ' he exclaimed . This is what he advises usto do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page : To admit testimony of negroes in court , and fix qualifications for voting applicable to both races alike . ' Speechless , he laid the sheet down . Gavin , ' he said at last , standing still on the rug in front of his son , and looking at him earnestly , you 've come home to a hell of a job . I ca n't see any end to it all . They say there 's going to be an election and a constitutional convention ; but if there is , all of us will have to apply for a special pardon before we can vote . That means , of course , ' he observed , with a bitter smile , we 'll never vote . Governor Hamilton called for a registration of voters in August , but not one single man worth killing has been allowed to qualify in this county  --  not one . ' His eyes burned and scorn rose in his voice . We 've all held some kind of office , they say , or '  --  he grimaced  --  we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime in this country to make a living ? ' he demanded . Or to serve as justice of peace , or on a school board ? ' He threw his long thin hands out hopelessly and his blue eyes were no longer misty , but flaming under his black brows . I 've been four times to register , and each time they 've turned me down . ' For a moment he was silent , sunk in thoughts too bitter to express . Then he dropped into a chair and leaned forward to face Gavin . ' I ' 11 be damned if I 'll apply for a pardon , ' he announced . A pardon fir- what ? President Davis is right in his stand . ' For another moment , he sat still , until his gathering wrath again burst out . Twenty thousand dollars ! It 's absurd ! Who do they want to run this country anyhow ? The scum o ' the earth ? ' The question seemed to answer itself and lie went on , in gathering wrath . My children have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resuming his pacing up and down . Their children , too , after you , and I , and they , arc all dead . ' 226 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 227What do they think we are made of ? ' he asked , turning in his tracks . ' Water ? I tell you , Cavin , men who went through four years of the army , and came out alive , will not endure what 's going on now in this state . And it 's getting worse every day . ' He paused , apparently trying to subdue his mounting emotions . ' Go on , ' Cavin prompted him . ' 1 'd better know how things are . ' ' The rule now is , ' Philip continued , almost as if he had never paused in his recital , ' that planters have to draw up contracts with their negroes  --  tout ruts satisfactory to the government officials at Galveston . ' Ile pused , with a significant smile . ' To get them approved , of course you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any such foolishness , ' he asserted , rrurving over to the window and staring out into the night , Ns it h his tall , severely erect back turned to Cavin . The flames in the firel dace were reflected in the shining panes , and he seemed to be looking out into another room full of light and warmth , a room more strangely real than the one in which he stood . ' Yes , ' he thought suddenly . ' Who knows what is real , what fancy ? ' He sighed and turned sharply from the window . ' Cavin , ' he asked his son , emphasizing every word , ' Do you realize that if any black negro should take a notion to make a complaint against me , for any reason whatever , the military could throw me into jail without so much as a warrant for my arrest ? God knows whether they 'd ever let me out , and , even if they went through the formality of trying me , I 'd have to come up before boor our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead certain to convict me . At least , ' he amended his conclusion , ' that 's their record so far  --  for white men of any reputation . ' He stopped in front of Cavin , turning toward his son a face marked now less by anger than by ironic , bitter amusement . ' The army claims control over all disputes involving soldiers or Union employees , ' he explained . ' That takes in most of the cases , of course . The regular civil courts are supposed to be operating , but '  --  he drew his lips tight  --  ' they might as well be closed . The Governor has ruled explicitly that the state courts have no jurisdiction over federal agents . Now that the Freedman'sBureau is in Texas , things 'll be worse yet , I suppose , because they tell me that organization has its own courts , too . ' ' Well , ' he said , sitting down heavily in his chair , ' there it is . There 's nothing to do but get along the best way you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top of a volcano . ' He sat groping for any facts he had left untold , and , drawing a long breath began again . ' We drew up a warning last week , after the negro troops tried to kidnap a white child , warning the military that if they can not stop such offenses , we can and will . Every planter in the county signed his name to it , ' he sighed , ' but God knows whether they 'll pay any attention to us . More likely , they 'll throw us all in jail for posting the notice . ' Cavin listened without comment , nodding from time to time . ' They sent a garrison of armed negro troops into this county in August , ' Philip went on . ' Fortunately , they stay too dead drunk , most of the time , to do as much damage as they might ; and they spend most of their time hanging around town , shootingcraps in gambling dens . But they 'll steal your hams and horses out from under your nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaned Colonel Brashear out one night last week , if most of his teams had n't happened to be in Galveston . ' ' Yes , I saw them , ' Gavin replied , ' when I was looking for ours . And I had some first-hand acquaintance myself with the Freedman 's Bureau . ' He threw a quick glance at his father. 228 And Tell of Time I And Tell of Time 229That reminds me . I better give you these . ' He hunted in his pockets until he found and handed over to Philip the cotton receipts that Matt had given him at Galveston . I 've already run into their fine soldiers , ' he continued , emphasizing the word sarcastically . In fact , I barely missed killing one of ' em before I got out of town . He may be dead , for all I know . So , ' he smiled grimly , I have some idea what 's going on . It 's worse than I expected  --  a good deal worse . Georgia seems to be quieter than this state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he suggested , refilling the pitcher on the table with hot water from the kettle that hissed on the coals at their feet . Draining his own glass , he set it down , and reached out for another sandwich . In Georgia , Shelby and John Martin I believe you know the Martin fancily ? ' he broke off , tapping his breast . ' Phis unifi , nn I have on is John Martin 's . ' I do , indeed . ' Philip settled back in his chair , his youth rising again betbre him , and his voice dropping to a pleasant , reminiscent level . ' She was Celeste Daingerfield . They used to make an extraordinary kind of wine on their plantation just out of Charleston . ' I know , ' said Cavin . ' Rice wine . I had some this summer at Sunny Fields . ' Yes , ' Philip nodded . ' Your mother and I have visited there . ' In his slow , resonant voice , he began to inquire about what had happened to his son since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dark , ' he declared , when I sent you that letter in care of Devereaux 's . Still , I felt pretty sure you 'd make for Savannah , or Cedar Ledge . That is , if you pulled through . ' He stuffed his pipe again , and held out his tobacco pouch to Cavin , inviting him to help himself . Gavin shook his head , smiling . You 'll think this is funny , Pa , but it 's the honest truth . I never learned to smoke in the army . We used to turn over all the liquor and the tobacco to the wounded men , and , when I was in the hospital When ? Where ? How badly were you hurt ? ' Philip interrupted . Oh , it was n't much . ' With a wave of his square , muscular hand Cavin dismissed the subject and returned to one that interested him more . I did n't know how to smoke then , when I had the chance , and I have n't learned since , ' he admitted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy than , until now , he had revealed himself to be . For a long time Philip sat watching his son between half-closed eyes . Then he roused himself . Let 's get to sleep the way we used to , ' he suggested , with a game of checkers to settle our minds . They need settling all right , ' he commented . You 'll agree to that , I suppose . It 's too late for any more talking tonight . ' He glanced at the clock above the mantel , which alreadystood at twelve o'clock . He rose to get the checkerboard which rested on top of the tall iron safe , where he stored his valuable papers , Letitia 's jewelry , and such money as he kept on hand . I must show you how to work the combination to this safe tomorrow , ' he told Cavin , picking up the board as he spoke . And here '  --  he indicated where a large pile of newspapers and pamphlets were piled inside a rack above the safe  --  arc some State Gazettes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Brazos Signal that Letitia 's been saving . If you 'll look ' em over , you 'll see how things have been going . ' He pulled the table squarely between them , and , drawing his chair up against it , set the checkers down , wit Ie a slight rattle , upon its polished surface . One round , ' he told his son , for a nightcap. ' 230 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 231They played , intent and quiet , until the clock began to strike the half-hour , and , instead of stopping at one metallic clang , went on until Cavin counted twenty strokes . He looked over the board at Philip and chuckled . Same old clock . Once I heard it strike thirty-seven times before it stopped . ' Rising , Philip leaned across the table and touched his son lightly on the head with his sensitive fingers . I 'm glad you 're back , boy . Give my apologies to Lucina for keeping you up so late . You 'll blow out the lamp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cavin sat for a while in front of the blaze , letting the familiar room again soak into his consciousness . He looked around , noticing the long , cheap yellow table , with six rickety legs , which Philip had picked up at the county seat before he married Letitia , intending to use it only in the kitchen for the servants or on outdoor occasions , like barbecues , when he might need an extra stand . It had served now , though , for seven years , in his dining-room , with a long rude bench , made by one of Philip 's carpenters , drawn up its length , at one side . On the other side , ranged against the unpainted , unpapered wall , were a number of finely designed chairs that Rhoades Cunninghame and his sister Caroline had brought into the bottoms from Carolina , and a tall highboy , with a pineapple carved upon each drawer , which , Cavin knew , Mary had taken with her from Savannah to Florida , and which Philip , on his last trip back , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little crookedly , was an oil paintingof Letitia 's grandfather , old Brewster Charlton , her mother'sfather . His head was held high above a tight stock and a black cravat , and the rich ivory tones of his skin and the flashingblue of his eyes were amazingly lifelike . Cavin studied the face without recognizing it , and then his glance fell on the wall where hung two crayon drawings of Letitia 's twins which a passing soldier , on leave , had done for some small compensation . They were execrable pieces of work , and the children stared out of the frame like stuffed dolls , lifeless and misshapen . Cavin wandered over to look at them , suddenly aware that he had not yet seen his little sisters . He laid his hand on the door , and looked back at the room , remembering that his father expected him to bank the fire and blow out the lamp . The chair he had just vacated was still swaying slightly . It was a plain , pine rocking chair , with a sagging cowhide seat cushioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cavin sank down into it and leaned over the fender to rake together the ashes  --  a fender of fine brass , delicately designed , matching the tools by its side . The andirons , however , were of black iron , forged in Philip 's own blacksmith shop by the man who made shoes for the horses and metal rims for the wagon wheels . And the stool in front of the hearth , on which the children sat to warm their feet , was only a wooden box covered with padding . Cavin recalled it from his own youth , but then it had had a different covering , he thought . Going across to the table to blow out the light , he turned its wick low , and was leaning over the tall chimney with his lips drawn together for a vigorous puff , when his eye chanced to fall on the rack above the safe where the newspapers were stored . It had a solid black front broken in one corner by a sketch of a branching tree , and , in the other , by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly he realized that the painting on the front of the rack was intended to represent a tree lit up , in the black night , by the rising moon . By George ! ' he exclaimed aloud , slapping his thigh , all my232 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 233life I thought the dark part of that picture was an enormous pig rooting in the ground . ' He remembered as a child lying on the round rag rug in front of the fireplace warming himself before he got into bed , and studying , as he lay there , the progress of the pig . I 'd have sworn it was a black Berkshire pig , ' he said . I must tell Lucina about it . ' Laughing , he went to his own room , that was down the passage from the dining-room . Fourteen steps  --  he counted them , yes they were the same  --  turn to the right at the end of the hall ; one step up , and bend your head . He was inside . The fire was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the shadowy room , with its walls sloping down to meet the floor . He moved silently over to his bed , with its twisted posts and its white ruffled canopy from which always hung , in season , an enormous mosquito net . There , with her head on a long bolster lay Lucina , sleeping as he had often watched her sleep on the grass on hot summer afternoons in their childhood at Cedar Ledge , with her hands crossed upon her breast , and her long dark lashes quiet upon her cheeks . As he stood watching her , he forgot the reports that Philip had been giving him , forgot the war , and remembered only that he was home at last with Lucina . He touched her fingers lightly , as he bent over her , and , feeling their chill , he drew the covers awkwardly higher . Opening her eyes , she smiled up at him , and was almost instantly asleep again . At sunup , Cavin was wakened by the loud clanging noise of a heavy iron hammer striking against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field hands to their work . Half an hour later , Aunt Emmy appeared with a tray on which were orange sections laid open like fans on paper napkins , hot black coffee , and buttered biscuits . Cavin heldup a warning finger , as she knocked gently and entered the room . Setting the tray quietly on a table beside him , in easy reach , she asked , in a sibilant whisper : Does you remember dar 's two bells , Mas ' Cavin ? One fur dressin ' , one fur eatin ' ? ' Cavin nodded , folding his hands under his head . He wondered if he would ever get over remembering the hunger that had almost never left him the last year of the war . To the day he died , he thought , he would never cease being grateful for good hot biscuits and coffee . He looked at the oranges and remembered how , every chilly night , Aunt Emmy always peeled the morning 's supply and thrust them , in their white skins , on a shelf outside the kitchen window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . Reaching out his hand , he picked up a stiff section and slipped it into his mouth . He knew exactly how it would taste , with the skin bitter and tough , and the fruit inside sweet as honey , yet slightly bitter and acrid , at the same time . Years later , eating sweet California oranges , he told Lucina how much better the ones tasted that Philip took off English ships at Galveston , along with huge bunches of bananas , and brought across the bumpy prairies to his storehouse on the Brazos . He did not ever know that most of the oranges he ate then , in his youth , grew in Spain and were part of the lot that had been shipped to England for marmalade , before ever they were put on ships for Galveston . He picked up another slice , and , leaning over Lucina , tickled her lips with it , watching her in amusement . She sat up suddenly , and he slipped behind her one of the big extra pillows which , during the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long bolster . I thought I was dreaming ! ' she exclaimed 234 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 235Lifting the tray , he set it down on the patchwork quilt . Pa says there 's plenty of trouble brewing in Texas ; but one thing sure , there 's enough to eat . ' He bit into his biscuit , luxuriantly tasting the sweet butter that was churned daily in the big wooden dasher always left to sun out beside the well . Then he noticed two small white packets on the tray and pointed them out to Lucina . With Pa 's compliments , ' he told her , smiling at her puzzled look . It 's quinine , ' he informed her , pronouncing the vowel long . You pour it in your first half cup of coffee . Everybody in the bottom takes a dose every day . ' He stopped and laughed . Everybody but Letitia . Pa 's never been able to get her to swallow the bitter stuff . Says she 'd rather have chills and fevers . Letitia 's like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but dead set in her ways . ' Taking up Lucina 's packet , he poured it into her cup . Here , drink it , ' he urged her . You 'll hardly taste it , in this black coffee . ' They were out walking around in the yard before the second bell rang . It had cleared during the night , and , though the ground was wet , the air was already warming under the sun , and the wind had died down altogether . I ought to set out my flowers , ' Lucina said , looking uncertainlyaround at the clean , sanded yard , with its precise beds marked off in slanting bricks , and filled in with rich black soil from the river bottom . The rosebushes , however , she noticed , were standing , like her mother 's at Cedar Ledge , in beds of clay and loam . Now , in late October , they were weighed down by yellow blossoms delicately veined in pink . The night 's wind and rain had lashed them about , however ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorny leaves stained a soft brick red beneath their shining , green surface . The space under the cedar trees , where Letitia 's bulbs came upin the spring , was raked and clear ; and the ground under the large , shiny holly tree by the front gate was packed down and smooth . The light that had blinded Lucina on the prairie seemed diffused and subdued , here on the river . It fell glaringly only on the white board fence enclosing the garden , on the white benches with trellised backs which edged three sides of the yard , and on the similarly trellised gate . Above it , there hung a copper bell that tinkled whenever the latch was lifted . Then , Cavin told her , Philip 's enormous dog , George , who always slept on the door-sill , would rise on his tawny haunches and growl ominously , relaxing into friendly affability only when certain that the entering caller was white , not black . The room in the garden seemed already taken up , Lucina thought , as she looked around . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they approached the house , the sun came out from under a passing cloud , fully illuminating the long , gray building . Unpainted , it sat low on the ground , barely off it , indeed , with the front gallery covered by a sloping , projecting roof supported on six square , rough posts . Four dormers looked out over the porch , and a wide ell at the back provided space for a kitchen , a dining-room , and a sitting-room opening out , by long windows , on a side yard planned for another garden , but given over , in fact , to chicken-coops . Philip had added this ell the year that he had married Letitia , and they had kept the two front rooms for quiet bedrooms . Soon , Philip had built an office for himself outside , adding to the house , at the same time , an extra hall and a bedroom down it for Cavin . The war came on , and the upstairs remained unfinished  --  a place in which to store odd bureaus and broken rockers . Philip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Time And Tell of Time 237Gavin and Lucina came in through the front door , down the hall to the dining-room . Chicken hash ! ' cried Cavin , pausing on the threshold . And waffles ! ' Lucina echoed his delight , catching sight of Aunt Emmy as Letitia 's fat cook entered the room , bearing a plate of waffles and two pitchers  --  one of fresh sugar cane syrup , the other of honey mixed with melted butter . My dear , ' Philip asked Lucina , as he took his seat , is there anything you had in mind to do today ? If not ' He paused , smiling pleasantly , with a reservation of some kind in his tone . Lucina hesitated . I 've some rosebushes and bulbs in the wagon that ought to be set out somewhere . I thought perhaps here by the kitchen ' She glanced out the long windowstoward the back yard cluttered with dog-kennels and chickencoops . Philip leaned back in his chair and fitted his long fingers together into a precise triangle . How about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shall we break the news ? As well now as any time , perhaps ? ' She nodded , smiling . News ? ' asked Cavin , as Lucina laid down her fork . They both sat watching Philip 's face , sensing that he was enjoying his unspoken thoughts . Well , ' he began , looking at Cavin with a ghost of a smile curving his thin lips . It 's been over thirty years now since I came out to Texas to visit your Cousin William . I was a young man then , ' he said , in an aside to Letitia , but his glance immediatelyreturned to his son . I remember that William and I rode all day long up and down the river , but toward sunset , we came out on the prairie to a place where the ground rose up from the river in a long slanting plateau , lightly wooded . From the top of that slant , we could see off in every direction , toward the river close by and , further off , toward the prairie that seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned across the table , and his glance sought and held Gavin 's . Always , ever since that evening , ' he concluded , I 've known that some day , if I stayed in Texas , I was going to build a house to suit me on that hill . ' His audience remained silent , realizing that his story was not yet finished . Taking out his pipe , Philip filled it and addressed his wife . My dear , you 've no objections ? Lucina ? Cavin , no use learning the filthy habit . ' Thoughtfully , he walked over to the fire , rolled a piece of paper beside it , and , lighting it , applied it to the tobacco in his pipe . Then , after settling himself again in his chair , he rose again , and , laying his hands on the table in front of him , smiled at his listeners . Wait a minute . I 'll get a map and show you . ' Burrowing in the pigeonholes of his safe , he held up a folded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the dining-room table , pushing aside the dishes to make room for the rattling sheet . See there , ' he said , pointing to a firm black cross . Well , that 's a sign I made thirty years ago to mark the place where I expected to build a house some day . I remember writing Cavin 's mother about it . ' Yes , ' Cavin broke in , and I know what you wrote her , too . ' No doubt , ' returned Philip equably . I 've reminded you often enough . Well , ' he continued , sitting forward in his chair , with his hands on the table , I think it 's time to start building that house , if I 'm ever to see it finished . What do you say , Cavin ? ' 238 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 239He turned squarely toward his son . The twins are coming on , and there 's FitzHugh . I sold my land in Florida before the war and leased your mother 's place in Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now  --  is yours , outright , but '  --  he smiled gently  --  we can pool our resources , I suppose ? Even with the war going on , Colonel Rutherford was able to ship some cotton out of Mexico  --  and he got a good price for it , too . Most of that money went into Confederate bonds , of course , but there 's a little on deposit in London  --  passage money , about . I thought , if the war went against us ' Shrugging his shoulders , he lifted his hands , spreading his fingers apart . When it came down to it , though , I could n't persuade myself to pull up stakes . ' He leaned closer . This place is clear . We can get an advance from Colonel Rutherford  --  all we need , I expect . How does it look to you , son ? ' he inquired . Cavin stood up , pushing back his chair . I think we 'd better start building , ' he said decisively . Well , then , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In that event , ' he went on , Lucy better get her garden started up there , on the hill . ' It was mid-morning when they set out , and the air had lost its chill , but not its freshness . In the woods , the odor of fallen leaves and wet stumps followed them , but as they came out into the open , the sunlit air was marked by some pungent , exhilarating perfume that it took Lucina years to identify and name hesitantly to herself as the sweet smell of open space . They crossed a little creek , the water coming up to their horses ' knees , and then Philip drew Pilot up , sharply . Here 's the very tree I tied my horse to , thirty years ago . ' The sun lay warm on the dry , brown grass which covered thespot . Toward the west , the rich , black bottom land was cut by the river and a small creek ; to the east , the dun and dreary prairie stretched out to the Gulf . Toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an open fan  --  a grove of oaks , cottonwoods , and bois d'arcs rising in an enormous half-circle , and spreading above them , along the creek , a line of grotesque cypresses . Letitia , Philip saw , was inspecting the location like a visitor , with a tranquil , impersonal interest . She does n't care , ' he thought , reading her mind , as if she had opened it to him . She simply does n't care . ' He tore his attention from her , taking such comfort as he could in Cavin 's delight . He has no idea , ' Philip meditated , that you can give everything you have on earth to a venture , and yet lose , in the end . Like President Davis , ' he thought , remembering , as he often did , the man who lay in Fortress Monroe , growing weaker every day . His eyes followed Cavin 's movements with a kind of still , passionate interest . Yes , it would be harder to see his son frustrated and baffled by life than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strolling over to his wife who stood leaning both arms on a low limb of a mulberry tree , looking absently down the sloping hill . Having children is like offering life several places , instead of one , to hit you a mortal blow . ' She raised her eyes and he saw that she understood him . Suddenly he was sad because she did . Ah ! well , ' he said gently . Even great Jove wept over his children . ' I le took her hand , and they stood watching Cavin pacing out a square . We 'll have to keep the rabbits off somehow , ' they heard him saying to Lucina . For a moment he seemed to have no solution for the problem . Then he set two of the negroes to cutting small240 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 241straight limbs which he had them stick , like staves , into the ground around the plants . Philip smiled . Over and over he had read how Odysseus , on his return , had stood back for some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests . Now it came to him afresh how unerringly right that story was , how in accord with human nature . I 'd have done the same , ' he thought , with his eye fixed on Cavin , exactly the same . Any father would have . ' That night , Lucina and Cavin sat on each side of the dining-room table drawing separate sketches . Philip leaned over them , studying the sheets . Lettie , ' he called , come here and look . ' She glanced over his shoulder , and quickly , while Lucina watched , drew two long lines to indicate a wide avenue leading straight from a gate to the house . That would be a nice place to scatter all your bulbs , would n't it , Lucy ? What kind of trees had you thought of setting out ? ' Almost before she thought , Lucina answered . No , no , ' Philip corrected her . Not in Texas , my dear . Cedars do n't do so well in dry years , and , young as you are , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick to locusts . They spring up quickly after a hurricane ' Hurricane ? ' Lucina asked , catching her breath . Yes , ' Philip responded firmly , meditating on the point , locusts are your best choice . ' Anyway , ' said Cavin , a grim mask dropping over his features , ' a man who 's been at Chickamauga can do without cedars , all the rest of his days . ' ' I 'd think so , ' said Philip , a glance of understanding passing quickly between him and his son . After a moment , however , he smiled down at Lucina , and , laying his hand affectionately on her head , sent an inquiring glance at his wife . Lettie , ' he said , we must invite the county to meet this child , next week . ' And Tell of Time 243Chapter IIDESPITE the difference in their ages , Povey Blount and William Charlton enjoyed a close friendship . William often said to Helen , his wife , that , since the night Letitia had driven away from their house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . Then , as time went on , he almost forgot the years that separated them . After they both returned from the army , they would sometimes sit together for hours , speaking rarely , and then about rain and weather and growing crops . Povey acts as if some spring 's broken in him , ' William worried . When he gets well , I must try to stir him up somehow . ' He tried , and continued to try , long after Povey had partiallyrecovered and had moved back from Holly Grove to his own plantation , Land 's End  --  named for the spit of land projecting into the Brazos , where Povey 's uncle , young Tobias Blount , had built his rambling whitewashed house when he first came out to Texas , in 1827 . Povey , ' William would inquire , riding over from his own fields to interview his friend , why do n't you go and call on the two charming young ladies visiting Colonel Brashear 's girls ? ' Povey would smile a slow smile that never rose into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would invariably say , but I must see to plantingthe West Field tomorrow . ' Or to building a levee , or torepairing fences , or to something else  --  William could seldom persuade him to leave his plantation . It 's unnatural , ' William would storm to his wife . It 's against nature for a handsome young man to live like a hermit . I thought if he came back he 'd come back changed ; but he 's back , and everything 's just the same . They walk around like ghosts  --  all of them . Helen , ' he would sigh wearily . I do n't see how it 's going to end . ' Then , her eyes , as black as the long jet earrings she always wore , would grow thoughtful , and she , too , would begin to fret . He never goes to church with us , any more ! ' she would complain , sighing . She recognized this omission , however , as a sign of apathy , not a turning toward sin ; for , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only as a road to salvation but also as a component part of their social system  --  as componenta part , indeed , as their courts or their plantations . Therefore , she understood that Povey was not necessarily renouncing his faith when he stayed away , as he did , from the little church where Letitia 's children had been christened respectively Felicia , Letitia , and FitzHugh . There , on Sunday mornings , the white people always seated themselves downstairs , while their servants occupied the balcony . Afterward , family groups were apt to join their rclat ions , all driving together to the little creek and spreading their dinners out side by side on long , white tablecloths laid flat on the ground . Time after time , in the past , Povey had sat by , while cold fried chicken was being exchanged for min ( ed hit-ken salad , covered over in a neat star design of sieved egg yolk ; or while pear chip preserves were being passed , or yellow pound cake . Time after time , he had sat listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Timeas he watched his friends pouring grape and blackberry wine out of great brown jugs . But not any more ; he had given up going to church altogether , now , it seemed . Even the Bishop no longer made any effort to persuade Povey to accompany him , when he arose , as he often did , at Land 's End early on Sunday mornings and started off to early service alone . Sometimes , though , they would sit for hours under Povey 's lacy chinaberry trees talking of war and , after that , of men 's strange passions and dark fears and long unanswered prayers . Theirs was a companionship which drew from two different sources , which met and merged in a poetic faith based less on theology than on a strong sense of the mysterious beauty moving in this world  --  a beauty which , they both agreed , men need as they need the air and the sun , and the wind , and the rain . You know , ' Povey admitted late one black night as they sat talking together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your creed , now ' he protested , leaving his sentence half finished . What are creeds but words ? ' the Bishop replied , in his clear , flowing voice , turning a thoughtful face toward the leaves above him . And what are words ? There 's nothing stranger than a word , Povey  --  that frail net in which men try to enclose every kind of meaning . " The Word was made flesh "  --  that is the eternal mystery . ' The Bishop 's gaze wandered slowly out across the dark sky and his ear caught the sound of the wind moving thinly in the cypresses by the river  --  a sound quite different from the heavy bass with which it sang through the oaks . He listened a moment wondering how to explain what had brought him to Texas and kept him there . Could any man ever explain his dream to another  --  even to his closest and dearest ?  --  he pondered . And Tell of Time 245Then he remembered a line he had read and marked a few days before in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Povey . " To hold a flickering candle in Time 's dark hall "  --  that is what the Church has to do , is n't it ? ' he asked in a voice that revealed how often he had argued this same subject with himself . He paused , and his eyes , set strangely aslant under his high brow , glowed with some urgent conviction . I am in Texas to hold up that candle , ' he said , at last . The priests of Isis and Buddha have had the same duty to perform . ' Povey smiled in the dark  --  a sorrowful , fleeting smile . I have not so good a reason for being here , ' he said . I am in Texas because I first loved one woman , and then another , and have since loved nothing , not your God , or Isis , or the Lord Buddha either . ' His low voice ceased , as he peered through the dark into the Bishop 's face . You married her to him ! ' he exclaimed , sitting upright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotly across his lips . The Bishop spread out his slender , brown hands and dropped them in a weary gesture . I 've always known you were going to say that to me , Povey . Because a man wears my cloth is no reason he wo n't on occasionbe a fool and a sinner , too , unless the Lord prevents him . I know . I 've been both  --  and that was one of the times . ' He locked his thin fingers behind his back and began to walk back and forth in quick , impatient strides . Povey sank back into his chair , as still as he would be when he was dead . It was the first time he had ever spoken his mind , the Bishop reflected , and probably it would be the last time , too . Therefore , when his pacing brought him again in front of Povey 's silent figure he stopped and faced him. 246 And Tell of TimePovey , tell me  --  I had hoped the war and her children He broke off , interrupted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What difference do her children make ? I 've sense enough to know that now  --  though I did n't at first . As for the war ' Leaving his sentence unfinished , he began another inthe cold , quiet voice of man uttering a simple fact . I never dreaded death as much as I do life . ' Yes , ' the Bishop thought with one part of his mind , while the other followed Povey 's voice , that 's why confessions are heard in dark churches  --  a man will not talk in the light . ' When I saw how things were , ' he ventured , I was afraid Yes , ' Povey interrupted , I know you were . I 'll admit I thought of that possibility , myself . I still do . Yes , ' he said , suddenly rising and falling into step with the Bishop , I ' 11 tell you the truth , there 's never a day yet I do n't think of it . I 'm not such a fool as to suppose that God  --  if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' He kicked away a stick that had fallen in his path , and laid his hand on his friend 's arm , swinging him sharply around . Ca n't you see ? ' he demanded . We were too young to understand that nothing in the past or in the future mattered ; she was hurt and I , too  --  unbearably hurt , I thought . Your God should spare mankind from being young , my good Bishop , ' he ended bitterly , and then , after a moment 's silence , began again to move restlessly back and forth across the wide yard . I saw from the very beginning that there was no answer , no way out for any of us  --  all of us being what we were . If we had been savages , it would have been simple . But being what we were '  --  he sighed deeply and explosively  --  being what we were  --  what is the answer ? ' Breaking his step , he moved over to the fence , leaning on the white top rail . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is . Here am I. Can you suggest what to do , my friend ? No , ' he said slowly , do n't answer . I know you ca n't , but a Hottentot could . ' He gazed out into the night . Plenty of men in this state , too , would call me a fool , and sometimes I think they are right , ' he admitted , lifting his gaze across the dark and vacant fields . Sometimes I despise myself . ' They stood there together , without speaking . The frogs begantheir nightly croaking in the river flat , and an alligator 's deep muttering roar broke across the quiet . That 's why we 're friends , ' said Povey , because you do n't know any sure answers , either . Come on in to bed . ' He laid his arm around the Bishop 's broad shoulders , and they stood , for a few moments longer in utter silence , each following his own thoughts out into the blackness that surrounded them . The Bishop sighed and stirred at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' They were at the doorstep when he put out his hand and touched his friend . I hope you 'll go tomorrow , Povey , ' he said in his most persuasivevoice . Povey stared at him . Go ? Go where ? ' Then in a flash he understood . Of course . Philip would be welcoming Cavin home . The boy was back , he had heard , with a wife . Suddenly his old despair quickened within him , and on an unreasonableimpulse , he made a sudden decision . No , ' he replied sharply ; I 'm not going ; I 'm not even invited . I 'm going down to Berryville tomorrow , to the dance judge Symington 's giving for his nieces . ' It was the Bishop 's turn to stare . He could hardly have been more astonished . You 've been advising me , ' said Povey sternly , to do just that . Well , I think it 's good advice and I 'm accepting it . That 's all . ' 248 And Tell of Time And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he meditated on how little he liked the turn his advice had taken . All night , he was restless ; but when he left early in the morning , he decided that it was best not to reopen the conversation of the night before . As he rode away , he found himself thinking of his home in Cheraw , and was suddenly homesick for it . This was a strange country , Texas . Every clay here , he ran into a problem he could n't solve . There had been months in Carolina , after he had given up his legal practice and entered the Church , when nothing more urgent than a christening had come up , when he had even had all the time he needed to write a history of the Cheraw Indians . This wo n't do , ' lw said , and fell to planning his work . Now , ' he thought , ' I alight just try holding service in the saloons . If they can sing dunking songs , they can sing chants , ' he mused , and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptable altar . ' IIc touched his mare , Fir city , lightly with his spurs . He was due at Locust I Iill by noon , and he had three or four sick people to visit first . A few hours later , when he turned into Philip 's lane , he saw ahead of him a long procession of Philip 's friends . Some were riding Kentucky mares , decorated with the faded rosettes and ribbons which they or their sires had won in old , forgotten races . Some were on tough little mustang ponies , with tangled manes , hard mouths , and resentful , rolling eyes . Others came in gigs pulled by nervous , wiry horses with delicate , twitching ears and long , well-shaped legs . I n the midst of this procession , one figure stood out , like Sam-ho Panza , from the crowd  --  the shrivelled figure of old Mr. Archibald Bland , who sat his freckled , gray mule , Gabe , aserectly as if the animal were a charger , and from time to time shifted the greenish tails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rump . He owned a three-acre island in the river , deeply shaded with live-oaks , and there he lived with his dogs and his chickens and his old mule , Gabe . What more does a man need ? ' he would ask Philip , whenever they fished together from his leaky boat . He kept Gabe 's mane roached and upright , but even then the cockleburrs would get into it , and at last he let them stay there  --  just as he let the steps to his house fall down and stuffed the hole in his skiff with rags . For not since his wife and children had been trapped in a burning house had he consideredlife worth taking much pains about . He was accompanied by young Doctor David Armstrong , only two months home from the war , who was reining in his prancing mare to keep pace with Gabe 's stiff legs . He had inheritedhis father 's plantation , Shadow Point , where , on an arm of land jutting out into the yellow river , he and his younger brother Byrnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed old Mr. Bland , and he himself had not yet decidedwhether to practise medicine here in the county , or in Harrisburg , where the crumbling capitol of the Republic still stood , overlooking Buffalo Bayou . He remembered , as he rode along between the locusts , that the man beside him had also lingered , on spring nights , under the shadow of the Rotunda at Charlottesville , and began at once to talk to him about the  --  tJniversity . David had enlisted in Virginia , where his father had sent him to study medicine ; and he had not been ilr " Texas for now nearly six years . His listener had not been in Virginia for twenty ; but they soon found they shared many recollections . Yes , yes , ' responded old Mr. Bland absently , as though he were recalling a familiar dream . He too knew how the Univer-250 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 251sity lawn looked between midnight and morning , with the white colonnades gleaming in the moonlight and the wavering shadowscrossing the damp grass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the seat beside his driver , raised his carriage-whip , with its flowing red ribbon , high in salutation . Fine day , gentlemen ! ' His hair was combed away from his face in front , but he still wore it long in back and about his ears , where , despite vigilant clipping and brushing , his short sideburnscurled against his cheeks . Lowering his whip , he lifted his wide hat , and his keen blue eyes gleamed pleasantly as he passed his friends . With him were his wife and two guests just then visiting at Holly Grove  --  Judge Duval White , from Berryville , and his sister , Miss Clarissa , a little wisp of a woman with a wide , firm mouth . She had learned music in South Carolina and was teaching it now in Texas . Clarissa , ' her brother sometimes said to her a little anxiously , you just missed being strong-minded . ' She looked after him with meticulous care , and every day had his servant brush his sleazy black coat and press the narrow black tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knotted , under his flaring wing collar . The Judge would never have thought of such matters himself . His mild gray eyes stared out too absentlyon the world to take note of creases in a coat . Does a man have to tie his cravat if he does n't want to ? ' he would demand mildly , but firmly , whenever his sister remonstrated with him . Judge Toombs Dickerson , from Austin County , was standing on the gallery at Philip 's house when Judge White arrived . Stepping modestly out of the carriage on a box provided for that purpose , Miss Clarissa threw a sudden searching glance at her brother . In her mind she was comparing him , to his advantage , with the tall man who stood lounging against Philip 's gallery , stroking a flowing brown moustache . Toombs Dickerson was born at Velasco and had never yet put foot out of his native state . His father  --  a Georgian  --  had been massacred with Fannin at Goliad , and , as a boy of nine , Toombs himself had taken part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacinto . At seventeen , he began to read law and , later , served as county judge before the war broke out , when he was assigned to the defense of Galveston . In April , 1865 , he saw no reason whatever for Texans to surrender because Virginians had . Still he was , above all , a man of common sense , and when the troops failed to reassemble at Houston in June , 1865 , he realized , at last , that the struggle was over . Returning home , he found a deputation of citizens waiting to welcome him back . Next day , without the formality of an election , he resumed his former office , sitting with two pistols in easy reach and the flag of the Republic nailed high up behind his chair . Never , except in court , was he ever seen with his wide hat off his head ; and even there he wore his tight trousers stuffed inside his high boots  --  and , in the hottest weather , tore off his collar . Yet Duval White , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Toombs Dickerson , nor could he bow more politely to a lady . Miss Clarissa surveyed Toombs now , however , with a vague air of distaste which he recognized . It was a warm clay for November , and he wore no coat over his pleated white shirt , only a striped vest made with a high , turned-down coIlar edged round with silk braid . This buttoned up under his brown chin , almost hiding the ready-made cravat which , in deference to the occasion , he had snapped on beneath his soft collar . He had discarded his boots , for the day , in favor of a pair of shoes252 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 253 with comfortable toes and elastic insets at the ankles ; and as he had left home that morning , he had lifted his enormous black hat off its cowhorn rack thinking he did very well . This , however , he saw at once , was not Miss Clarissa 's opin- ion . Smiling , he came forward to swing open the gate for her . Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , armed neutral- ity , so now he began , in his deep , drawling voice , to tease her , his alert eyes , more yellow than brown , twinkling as he spoke . Miss Clarissa , ' he demanded , when you reckon you 're going to get me all dressed up slick and fine , like the Judge here ? ' He held out his hand , as he spoke , half-winking at Judge White across his sister 's thin shoulders . The two men shook hands heartily . A few weeks before , they had planned a couple of days ' shooting together , but a riot had prevented them from carrying out their intention . Too bad we never got those partridges for breakfast , Judge , ' said Toombs now , recalling the emergency which had arisen in the narrow section where their counties joined . The three of them now walked over to speak to Letitia and Philip , who were standing in the yard , with Cavin and Lucina beside them . Good morning . Good morning ... Lucina , my dear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time after time , Glad to see you .... How are you ? ' A good many of his guests thought , as they passed him , that with his straight back , his shadowy blue eyes , and his still dark hair , he was handsomer than his son . His long black coat , held together at his throat with a large single button , just escaped his knees , accentuating his height . His trousers , with their tight legs and very wide cuffs , had been made before the war , and likewise his frilled white shirt , but they became him well . ( : avin 's shoulders had yet to fill out , his thin body to take on more weight , before he would make as impressive a figure as Philip . Perhaps that time would never come . The next man to ride up was young Mr. Alexander Winston , who , like Cavin , had fought in the Fourth Texas and had left an arm in Virginia . As he saw him dismounting , Philip remarkedunder his breath to Letitia that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ever saw  --  the same shining , black hair and cold , gray , searching eyes , the same narrow head and furious , reckless temper that never seemed to smolder out . He came alone and was eager to talk with his stocky young neighbor , Mr. Thomas Abernethy , whose connections at Shelbyville , Kentucky , had been kind enough to entertain him , Alexander , during a brief furlough between battles . He wanted to ask Thomas , too , how the fighting had been on the Border , where Thomas had been stationed throughout the war ; and whether he had seen any of the camels President Davis was said to have turned loose there during the Mexican War , twenty years earlier . Lord ! How I'd-a hated being stuck down there ! ' Alexander groaned , and then smiled as he saw Thomas approaching with his two stoutish , older sisters , whose figures revealed their strange passion for cake and pickles at unaccountable hours . Alexander paused . How are you , Miss Minerva , Miss Eliza ? ' he inquired , lw.uning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her c1 reams ; but next morning , being a realist , she took a stern glance at her near-sighted eyes and her pudgy figure , and put aside her dream . Somebody 's got to run this plantation , ' she told herself resolutely , and set about doing it with energy and competence . Already she could tell that her young brother Thomas was goingto be better at books than at cotton-planting . She didn't254 And Tell of Time j And Tell of Time 255mind . She had plenty of ideas herself about managing the place . If the Lord did n't make a girl pretty , she reflected thankfully , He nearly always gave her good sense . Not that it was altogether a good exchange , but still  --  there was that new Hungarian grass everybody was talking about , for fodder . She resolved to plant some . As Miss Minerva passed by Philip , old Mr. Tripp Cuttross approached  --  old Mr. Cuttross , who could lift his hat like a prince and often boasted that he lived on a dollar a week . Sober @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' He was followed by Mr. Davidson Rideout , who , after the war , had started up a tiny store on the road that passed his place , where he never remembered to dust the shelves . He wore a spotted pair of trousers , but he was known to have his boots polished every day and never - not even in August  --  to leave off his coat at meals . I I is wil*  --  , like himself ; was brought up in Annapolis , where , except liar the war , their daughter , Evelina , would now have been in school . Now , of course , she would never go , a Iixct which distressed her parents far more than it did her . Her father had never had a large plantation in Texas  --  only a few hundred acres , and nobody knew how he held on to that , nowadays . Mrs. Horatio Spurlock , corning up behind Evelina , paused to admire the fit of the young girl 's dress . She had reason to do so , for she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones . Mrs. Spurlock 's husband was a better soldier than a business man , so , since the war , she had quietly taken to doing fine sewing , being careful to put it out of sight whenever dear Horatio was around . She examined Letitia 's frock also , finding no fault with the numberlessrows of narrow tucks which she had stitched into its wide skirt , nor with the smoky blue velvet ribbon with which I.ucina had laced her basque . She stood back a moment admiringthe taste which had dictated exactly that combination of blue with ashy rose . I do declare , Lettie , ' she told her , kissing her , you get prettierevery single day . You 'll have to , ' she added , kissing Lucina too , to keep up with this young lady . ' Stopping in her tracks , she smiled at this bride of Gavin 's  --  this slight , dark , glowing girl , with such shining , dark hair , such happy , brown eyes and smilinglips , lips almost as red as the dress she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that silk 's been dyed , but , ' she admitted , whoever dipped it knew how . ' She leaned over and , on an impulse , kissed Lucina again . Gavin , ' she remarked severely , you stole a march on us . And all the girls in the county setting their caps for you , too ! ' Two men came late , John and Kirby McGaughey , with their wives and sons . They were middle-aged brothers , with a great deal of iron-gray hair , loud , rumbling voices , and extremely activefeet inside their high boots , which they wore everywhere , their spurs clanking at every step . Since the war they had taken up cattle-raising on a big scale . They were always telling Philip that , with things the way they were , it was a heap better sense to turn to white labor . When the bush fall season was over , now , most of their cowhandswould go back to working in stores in the German settlementat the far end of the county , or back to the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to raise potatoes and beans . And the Freedman 's Bureau , they devoutlyhoped , would never come poking around demanding contracts between free white men . Philip , ' John said , shaking his host 's hand , better come into the cattle business with us . These fool contracts they 're talking about now 'll drive you plumb crazy , if you keep on planting cotton . ' 256 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 257The Bishop fell in behind him . There was nobody he enjoyed talking to more than Philip , but he passed on to get acquainted with Cavin . I knew your mother , ' he told Lucina , when I was a young man visiting around in Savannah . ' He began to tell her about those days now , with evident relish and no sign of hurry . Do n't you go monopolizing the belle of the ball , Bishop , ' said Colonel Rutherford , who had come in from Galveston . I have n't spoken to her yet . ' He smiled at Lucina and spoke hastily to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regrets . He 's down again with the fever he picked up at Matagorda . ' Ah ! I 'm sorry , ' said Philip . Lucina , you must meet the Colonel later , when he recovers . He is one of our Texas proselytes , ' he informed her , a Northerner who served both in the Republic and the Confederacy . ' She held out her hand to Colonel Rutherford , smiling ; and Philip turned to welcome a tiny lady just approaching . How do you do , Mrs. Dyess ? ' Philip said warmly . And Miss Winnie Lee ! ' he exclaimed , holding out his other hand . How are you ? ' Colonel Rutherford smiled and bowed , too . He admired Mrs. Dyess without reservation . She had a delicately formed body ; and , although she was well on to fifty , an eager , childlike face . But her looks were deceiving . All alone she had come out from Mississippi , a widow with her three boys and her slaves , and had taken out an extensive head right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , at his death , had left her all his propertybesides . It 's a pity she is n't a man , ' Colonel Rutherford often thought , and then wondered why he thought so . She made a better job of cotton-raising than most men , and she was , he admitted , remarkablypunctual in meeting her obligations . You 're looking well , Miss Winnie Lee , ' said Philip cordially , directing his attention to Mrs. Dyess ' companion . Still sleeping late ? ' Everybody knew Miss Winnie Lee , who , despite ten years of matrimony , had all the characteristics of an old maid . Men , she sniffed , were poor creatures  --  all except John Kempers , whom she had married . He was as poor as Job 's turkey and had had only one thing to offer her  --  the privilege of sleeping as late as she pleased in the morning . Miss Winnie Lee had never combed her own hair until she became his wife . But they had been happy . Now he was buried in Virginia , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her friends in turn , teaching their girl children to paint on fine china , and their boys to keep their feet off other people 's chairs , and to look a questioner straight in the eye . Last of all , came Colonel Carpenter Brashear , a widower , with his two pretty , vivacious daughters , Miss Sabra and Miss Alice . His rusty carriage-top was folded back , and carpet no longer covered the floor of the swaying vehicle , but the horses that drew it were rubbed down and shining , and the coachman that drove it knew how to hold up his reins . Sorry to be late , Philip , ' Colonel Brashear apologized , taking out a hemstitched pocket handkerchief and dusting his strong , brown hands , but I met up with a couple of rascally soldiers who took a fancy to my horses . Fortunately Howard Blakely came along with his boy , and here we are , ' he concluded , with the horses . ' I hope we all have as much luck , ' Philip congratulated him . Letitia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , laying his hand on Howard 's son , who , since Cold Harbor , had been sunk in perpetual melancholy , with the sight of one eye gone entirely , and of the other nearly so. 258 And Tell of Time And Tell of Time 259Bishop Gregg had been in Texas only a few years . Therefore gatherings like this interested him immensely . He took his seat in a rocking-chair on the front gallery and watched the people moving amongst the rosebushes . A stranger , he thought , might well wonder what common tie all these friends enjoyed . But he had lived long enough in the state to know that those who had had a similar bringing up in the older South naturally flocked together in Texas . Whether newcomers possessed money , or lacked it , was of far less importance in this bottom , he reflected , than whether they were disposed to fit easily into the pattern of life already established on the Brazos . He had tried , without much success , to explain these matters to Major Bradford , a Northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was a member of the Bishop 's church and had , therefore , sought him out . Soon they discovered that they had met before , when the Bishop was on a summer 's visit to a classmate 's home in New Jersey . Now Major Bradford was stationed , not at Berryville , where the largest garrison was , but down the river ten miles , at a small outpost where cotton claimed for the Federal Government was stored . And yet I 've never been able to make him understand the situation here in Texas , ' the Bishop thought . Never . ' For a moment his mind hovered anxiously around the case . Maybe I 'd be wise to ask him if he ever read Burke 's great chapter on how often folly and madness are perpetrated in the name of liberty , ' he mused , and immediately rejected the idea . He 'd be certain to quote Carlyle back at me , ' he decided , a half smile appearing on his lips . How 'll I ever explain this country to him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be told , the Bishop reflected unhappily , entirely too many . No wonder it was easier for Southerners to flock together . For instance , ' the Bishop went on thinking , there is thecounty judgeship . The planters on the Brazos seem to reward their judge exactly as they do their bishop  --  when they market their crops . ' The circumstance had bothered him when he first came to Texas , but not any longer . He had learned better how to interpretevents on the Brazos , where the planters preferred to lay their own roads , and pay the costs of justice direct . Was n't it cheaper , they reasoned , to look after things yourself than to pay a lot of clerks at the county seat to do it for you ? So they kept the tax rate low , and burned the notes with which the judge sometimes supplemented his meagre salary . Yet they would not have elected a judge whose integrity they held in doubt . Yes , ' the Bishop thought , his mind returning to the point from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get along  --  we do n't have to stop and explain things to each other . Things like Mr. Cuttross 's habit of sitting on his front gallery in his nightgown on hot days ; or '  --  his eyes grew sad  --  Povey 's absence here today ; or why nobody ever mentions his family to Tazewell Barclay . ' His eye fell pityingly on a man just then talking to Philip  --  a man whose wife never accompanied him to gatherings , whose son , as everyone knew , had fallen on evil ways in New Orleans . Why , ' thought the Bishop , rising , I 'm getting to be a regular Texan myself ! ' He was going over to inquire how FitzHugh was when he saw that Philip seemed to be explaining something to a group of people gathered around him . The Bishop got up and strolled closer . If you will all be so good as to walk back to the river , ' Philip was saying , the cowboys from Lost Island Ranch will proceed to demonstrate what poor riders most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
