txt About eleven years ago Martin ( Red ) Ritter , ragged but likable , clogged on the sidewalks for theatregoers ' pennies . One night Julius Tannen , master of ceremonies in the " Vanities , " saw Ritter and led him into the Earl Carrol Theatre . There the boy made an impromptu " hit " and was showered with coins . Tannen , who was brought up in an orphan asylum , developed a paternal interest and took the urchin into his home with his two sons . He wished to adopt the boy , but the Children 's Court found a barrier . The actor was a Jew and the boy a Catholic . Yesterday , at 22 years of age , and a little battered , Ritter was under arrest in the West Forty-seventh Street station . The police accused him , chronologically , of holding up a steamship agency , stealing a taxicab , running down two youths with the cab , and trying to kill a policeman . Ritter was with another armed youth who escaped . Hold Up Three in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supply Company at 564 West Fifty-second Street and pointed .38-caliber automatics at Vincenzo Tisbo , the proprietor ; Ralph Adramis , a bookkeeper , and Pasquale Detrani , a tenant in the building . They left with $106 , 14,000 Italian lire , valued at $580 , and $10 taken from the tenant . Outside the robbers hailed a taxicab and told Arthur Johnson , the driver , of 48 West Seventy-third Street , to go south . In Forty-sixth Street , between Eighth and Ninth Avenues , the driver was ordered to stop . He tried to turn his head , but there was a pistol near each ear . " Get out ! " commanded one man . " Do n't turn your head . Look straight ahead and go in the hallway or I 'll blow your head off your shoulders . " With both gunmen following , Johnson walked into a hallway . He pleaded for his cab . He said : " Have a heart . All I have is three bucks to my name . " " Give him a five spot , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5 bill into Johnson 's hand . From an upper hallway window Johnson saw one of the gunmen take the , wheel of the cab . At Eighth Avenue and Forty-fifth Street Patrolman Joseph Hulsman was crossing when the taxicab made a right turn west into Forty-fifth Street . The cab headed straight for the patrolman . He jumped aside but was struck on the left hand , v4lich was temporarily paralyzed . Next the cab knocked down Jack Heyman , 18 , of 107-16 120th Street , Richmond Hill , L. I. , and Milton Clott , also 18 , of 2,815 Brighton Sixth Street , Brooklyn . Ritter jumped out of the cab and his hand dived into his overcoat pocket , Hulsman said . The patrol- man , who is left-handed , was unable to draw his revolver because of his injury . He grappled , though , and pinned Ritter 's arm as the butt of the pistol came out of the pocket . " Give it to him ! Let him have it ! " Ritter cried as his companion emerged from the rear of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go Off Hussman heard the hammer of the other man 's pistol snap futilely on a dud as he swung Ritter around as a shield . Then the policeman , who is 6 feet 21/2 inches tall r .. nd built to proportion , hurled Ritter against the other gunman and all three fell down . Ritter and his partner got up and ran . Patrolman Hulsman was right behind , his revolver now in his numbed hand . In a hallway at 325 West Forty-fifth Street , before Ritter could put up a fight , Hussman closed in with a couple of rights to the chin . The other man escaped toward Ninth Avenue Meanwhile Heyman was treated on the scene for abrasions of the left knee and went home , while Clott was taken to Polyclinic Hospital with an injured back . After several hours of questioning by Nathan Kaplan , Assistant District Attorney , Ritter was booked last night for assault and robbery , grand larceny and violation of the Sullivan law .

The inspector also said that Ritter admitted having spent a year in jail for an auto theft . Tannen , after keeping him a week , offered to engage a governness of the Catholic faith to keep custody of young Ritter in March , 1927 , but Justice Edward F. Boyle of Children 's Court said the law was definitely against adoption . At that time Ritter was a handsome youngster , with an upturned , smiling mouth and tousled red hair .
