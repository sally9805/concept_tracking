Most of the 1.300 Republicans who packed into Chicago 's Hamilton Club one afternoon last week to hear Indiana 's James Eli Watson orate for two and one-half hours , thought they were listening to the first gun of a G.O.P. Midwest campaign against President Roosevelt . A few of them even fancied they were witnessing the start of a drive by the long-legged , large-paunched. small-eyed ex-Senator for the party 's 1936 Presidential nomination . <P> What they were all treated to was an oldfashioned , rip-snorting stump speech by an Old Guardsman whose battle-cry was : ' ' Back to the Constitution ! " <P> " Jim " Watson flayed President Roosevelt for abandoning the gold standard , for trifling with the currency , for scaring off private credit , for unleashing a Blue Eagle " boycott , " for concealing Budget deficits by " double bookkeeping . " Cried he : <P> " Roosevelt , in a dozen speeches , said no responsible government would break a covenant in respect to meeting its obligations in gold . Yet that is just what he did do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he is trying to do something . ' ( Laughter ) . . . The President has said this whole plan is an experiment ; that if it does not succeed he will know it sooner than anybody else and then will try something else ; that he intends to keep on trying this , that or the other policy just as long as there is any thing left to try . . . . <P> " The wealth of the country can not be wholly redistributed by taxation processes . . . . We are opposed to regimenting every young man entering active life , putting him in a straitjacket , giving him an opportunity to be so much and no more . Men can not be thus leveled without handicapping individual initiative . <P> " The mere fact that a world-wide depression has upset the whole earth , changed all financial , commercial and economic conditions , and produced governmental revolutions everywhere - that fact , stern and forbidding as it is , should not be permitted to drive us away from those basic realities that underlie our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvelous growth of this republic and that still must constitute the beacon light to lead us on to greater heights of industry , prosperity and liberty . ... I believe the Republican Party should reaffirm its determination to stand by the Constitution ! "
