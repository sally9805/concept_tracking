A specimen of the world 's largest known flower last week bloomed in the U. S. for the first time . Custodian of this prodigy , whose scientific name is Amorphophallus titanum and which is called krubi by the islanders of its native Sumatra , was the New York Botanical Garden in The Bronx . Only five times before had Amorphophallus titanum bloomed outside the Sumatra jungle-twice in London 's Kew Gardens , once in Holland , once in Germany , once in a botanical garden in Java . During last week 's excitement Assistant Curator Wendell Holmes Camp observed that The Bronx 's plant was probably the ' ' most photographed plant in the history of botany . " <P> In a greenhouse which sunlight kept normally at a temperature of 85 , the plant had stood inert for five years in a box of earth four feet square . Three new leaves appeared but quickly withered and died . After this came a sprout which The Bronx scientists rightly took as a sign that the monster was about to bloom at last . By last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ft. 1 in. long and thick as a telephone pole at its base . In , the final 24 hr. of its rise it grew one inch . The whole plant was 8 ft. 5 in. tall . <P> After a night and morning of anxious waiting by botanists with 400 spectators flattening their noses against the greenhouse glass , a fleshy spathe began to unfurl from the spadix and spread out in a bell-shaped bloom . The bell was greenish yellow outside , warm maroon inside . At full bloom the circumference of the bell 's lip was 12 ft. 10 in . By this time the plant had begun in earnest to emit its characteristic odor-a sickening carrion stench . <P> Amorphophallus titanum is supposed not to be self-fertilizing , to require pollen from another plant . Its smell would therefore serve the purpose of attracting carrion-eating insects , carrying pollen on their legs . Last week newshawks , photographers , a water-colorist and many a botanist braved the gagging odor to watch the spectacle at close range . One botanist stood on , a stepladder , peered down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the spadix , rows of male , female and hermaphroditic flowers . <P> When withering and decomposition started , The Bronx botanists cut off parts of the plant which they prepared for a pickling process involving chromic and acetic acid , alcohol , xylol and melted paraffin . The pickled pieces will be sliced .005 millimetres thin with a microtome , stained for study under the microscope . One thing the scientists especially hope to learn is the mechanism of Amorphophallus titamim 's titanic stench. * <P> Other news concerning the growth of plants came last week from Harvard University , which announced receipt of a gift of $615,773 for a long-range research program to increase the rate at which plants convert solar energy into stores of energy available to man . Donor was Godfrey Lowell Cabot , Boston 's blueblooded 76-year-old carbon black manufacturer who graduated from Harvard in 1882 , magna cum laude . In memory of his late wife Mr. Cabot designated his gift the Maria Moors Cabot Foundation for Botanical Research .               @ @ @ @ @ @
