CARRIE A STORY BY McCREADY HUSTON T HE only unscheduled halt in Caroline Mott 's wedding journey of six months occurred within fifty miles of home when the train stopped on a siding and stood there as if it would never move again . To Caroline this delay was a trifle in a tour that had included most of Europe , but to Edward it became after the first five minutes a major issue . After marching from their section to the vestibule and back several times he got down from the step and stood with the porter , staring unhappily ahead . Caroline could see him from her window . His vexation amused her at first . He looked as if he considered the lost time an offense against his affairs . He had telegraphed his father from New York that they would arrive in time for Sunday dinner . That feast , Caroline had been reminded several times during the morning , was at half-past one . Now they were going to be late . As Edward told her on one of his trips into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train should start immediately it would not get into Empire until two . It went on , not immediately but presently ; and Caroline expected her husband to recover his normal temper . It was then she laid aside her book and began to take an interest in the incident , for Edward did not recover . He remained upset . He had ridden across strange countries in indifference butnow he kept pushing up his left cuff , glancing at his watch , and peering from the window for landmarks from which to make calculations . If this had been the agitation natural in a son returning home with a bride Caroline would have remained amused . By nature and training she was a gay companion . What finally disturbed her , what finally caused the first serious inquiry to creep into her eyes , was the persistence of Edward 's anxiety over being late at his father 's table . She tried to take him out of it with a jesting rebuke , but the face he turned to her from the window , from which he had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would n't matter if we had n't wired we 'd be there , " he retorted . " When you tell father you 'll be there at a certain time he expects you . " Caroline subsided . The tone made her fear their first quarrel might not be far away . The state of mind was new to her . She was measuring by her own companionable father and the fathers of her friends . Then there was the injustice of his remark about the wire . She could have reminded him that the responsibility for the wire was exclusively his . She had even opposed it . In their hotel in New York , just off the steamer , she had seen no reason for being so precise . Edward 's family knew when the boat got in ; she and Edward would be along in due course . She had tried to make light of his rattling of railroad time-tables and telegraph blanks , saying : " We might take a notion to stop off and see Niagara Falls , Eddie . After all , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans , where shall we be ? Why not just walk in on your people when we get there ? " But Edward Mott , bent over the writing desk , had enjoyed neither Caroline 's allusion to Niagara Falls nor her suggestion of omitting the telegram . " Father does n't like people walking in , " was the phrase with which be closed the passage . Caroline had n't liked it . She did n't mind the wire , though it placed them under the compulsion of getting there and brought about exactly this disturbance on the belated train ; what she objected to was her husband being in awe of somebody . The men of her own connection never moved in deference to anybody nor were they forever bent on exacting deference . In this situation there was an intimation that she was moving toward an alien environment , and it frightened her . Edward 's conduct on the train revealed to her that from the landing of the ship he had been under a strain which had now warped the happy conditions of their honeymoon . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She remembered now a small man of about fifty-five , with carefully parted and brushed iron-gray hair who when he greeted her seemed to have no bones in his hand . Afterward on the boat she had chided herself for having thought him disappointing , for it was he , J. Edward Mott president of the Mott Steel Spring Company , of Empire , that thriving Middle-Western city , who had paid their passage and supplied Edward with enough travelers ' checks for their needs . They had been married at her home outside of Philadelphia . Her people were a happy lot . She closed her eyes as the train approached Empire . She had never seen the town . Because of Edward 's strange behavior she was not eager to look . On the verge of her new life she wanted to recall her own father , who did n't care whether she was late for Sunday dinner or not . Just before the porter came to get them ready she gave a start and opened her eyes . She had remembered that every time a letter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been silent and preoccupied for a day or two . As she coupled that with this extreme concern she felt her heart sinking . Edward 's worry was deep as they descended on the platform at Empire but it did not prevent him from calling to Caroline 's notice the recent elevation of the tracks and the construction of a new station . " They say it cost nearly a million dollars , " he remarked as they hastened across the polished floor of the waiting room toward the exit marked " Taxicabs . " As they followed their bags through the door he explained : " When you tell the folks you 're coming they expect you at the house . Meeting people at the train is n't the same thing . We meet guests , of course , but not the family . " Recalling Edward 's references to the three automobiles of the Mott family Caroline thought they might have broken a custom ; but at the same time she was relieved , because going up in a taxi meant facing her husband 's parents just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling suit and tried to show a becoming interest in the city that was the seat of the Motts . There was the Mott Loan and Trust , twelve stories , and the Hotel Mott on the public square , and finally they were on Mott Avenue . She looked out at the proper times and made appropriate acknowledgments . She had a premonition of the house before Edward said " There it is " and called to the driver , as if an Empire taxicab man would have to be told the location of the residence of J. Edward Mott . The cab ran up into a drive and discharged them at the side of a high , wide , red-brick house trimmed in scrolled wood . They entered the end of a veranda and crossed in front of tall windows behind which were stiff lace curtains . In another moment they were standing in a center hall lighted by blue-glass panels that flanked the front door , and the little gray man was advancing from a shadowy parlor and saying , " Well , you 're late . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but just stood there looking at them , fingering a slender gold watch chain which , irrelevantly , held Caroline 's eyes . She wondered why at this important moment she was noticing how neatly the gold line lay across the smooth gray waistcoat from pocket to pocket . Somebody , she felt , had to speak , so she managed to say : " An hour late getting back from a twelve-thousand mile trip  --  I call that a record . " Evidently that was wrong , for Eddie did n't rally to her support , and she tore her gaze from the watch chain to find that Mrs. Mott had appeared and was holding Edward against her purple-silk bosom . Holding him with her left arm , she extended her right hand to Caroline , who had an impression of a large quantity of evenly colored yellow hair surmounting a countenance dominated by bright black eyes . " You will want to go upstairs , " was her greeting , as if they had parted only an hour ago , perhaps after church . " You and Eddie can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your clothes . We 're ready to sit down . " Edward 's ablutions were a miracle of promptness for a young man who always took time for grooming himself , and he was fidgeting around the rear east bedroom while Caroline tried to smooth her hair in a panic of haste . She had a conviction that she alone  --  not even the railroad  --  was being held accountable for the delay in the operations of the household machinery of the Mott s . She turned to him despairingly , her lovely young face suffused with trouble . " Go on down , Eddie , " she pleaded , feeling she could not make her hands function while his watchful presence was filling the atmosphere of the high , dark , old-fashioned bedroom . But he could not bring himself to trust her to be prompt . He made excuses , waiting till she finally broke off and joined him for the descent . When they appeared in the parlor Caroline , glancing toward the dining room beyond , saw a middle-aged serving woman placing the roast on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a querulous call from below . Instantly Mr. Mott was seated at the head , Mrs. Mott at the foot , and the bride and groom between . As Mr. Mott shaved off slices of the rolled ribs of beef and handed the plates to the serving woman to carry around to Mrs. Mott , who had the vegetables , the conversation began . " Well , how 's Europe ? " It was as if Mr. Mott had said , " How is the county seat ? " Caroline stole a shy glance at him , hoping to discover an avenue to naturalness and ease . But his expression behind his steely looking glasses baffled her , and she dropped her eyes to her plate . Eddie answered his father in what sounded to Caroline like the echo of an attitude . " Pretty good , father . " All of the buoyancy , the heartiness , which had attracted Caroline to Edward Mott seemed to have been absorbed by the inscrutable personality of the father . " Hear much over there about not buying American stuff on account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't think so . Just talk put out by a lot of people against the administration . " It was Edward 's turn to question . " How 's business ? " " Supposed to be bad . I 've seen it worse . Matter of fact , we 're off only about ten per cent from this time last year . " " That 's good . I ca n't wait to get down to the plant . " Caroline glanced at him inquiringly . He had not mentioned the Mott family enterprise , in which he was a stockholder , during their six months together . " I want to take you to the Chamber of Commerce luncheon to-morrow , " Mr. Mott said , helping himself to another slice of the beef . " Better be ready to make a little talk . Might say something about business conditions in Europe . Fact , I called up the secretary and said you 'd be there and might say a few words . " " I 'll be glad to , dad . Of course , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Caroline felt her face burning for Edward . He had played in Europe , ignoring every solemn interest . With the shame she felt a sudden anger . Marriage was a mutual affair . If he had intended this play-acting with his father he should have taken her into his confidence . Now she was forced to attend a question from Mrs. Mott , who had been silent , looking from her husband to her son and back , listening to questions and replies . " How did you enjoy Europe ? " she asked . " Oh , enormously ! " Caroline turned to her , glad to forget the depressing interchange of the two men . " Of course , I had been over two or three times before , but it is like discovering a new world when you go as we did this time , on a holiday . It was lovely . You see it 's the first time I was ever free of the family " Caroline saw at once from the shadow that seemed to cross Mrs. Mott 's face that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course daddy and mother are adorable , but you do so like to get out and try life for yourself ! " Mrs. Mott contemplated her in silence for some moments . Then she said somberly : " I hope you are going to like Empire . I am having a little luncheon bridge in your honor Wednesday , and Thursday Eddie 's Aunt Sara , Mr. Mott 's sister , is giving a tea for you . Friday I want to take you to the tea at the Forward Club , and Saturday Millie Tener is giving a bridge . There will be other things later , especially after these get into the paper . I told the society editor she could use your picture next Sunday . " " I am sure it is lovely for so many people to want to entertain for me . Are you sure it 's all right about the newspaper ? I .. . never had my picture in a paper . " Mr. Mott emitted a sound . " Sure it 's all right . You 're a Mott now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice-cream Mr. Mott lighted a cigar and handed one to Eddie . Caroline had never seen her husband with a cigar . As they passed into the other room , she said to him in a Iow voice : " Give me a cigarette . I left my hag upstairs . " Cupping his hands over the match to light his cigar he shook his head quickly . " Lay off that , " he muttered . Caroline took refuge in a chair . Mr. Mott did not sit but walked up CARRIE and down the room . At the third turn he confronted the group . " What do you say to a little drive around ? Carrie 's never seen the town . " Carrie . . . she had never been called that . She was about to mask a protest in a joke when Mr. Mott interrupted , " I 'll be getting the car out . " " If you do n't mind , Mr. Mott , I think I shall ask to be excused . I should like to unpack and freshen up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Rats ! It 'll just be an hour or so around town . Get the air . Besides , I 've got something to show you out in Brookside Gardens . " Edward sat with his father in the front seat of the heavy looking enclosed car which Mr. Mott guided over the quiet Sunday streets at a slow , even rate of speed which Caroline , as she sat beside her mother-in-law in the rear , decided was in harmony with the man . It indicated a person so confident of reaching all of his goals that he felt no compulsion to hurry . There were a profusion of stop streets in Empire which Mr. Mott approached even more slowly and paid civic respect to with a prodigious clashing of gears . After they had viewed the ornaments of the downtown district and had driven out to and past the sprawling factory upon which the Mott fortune was founded , they drove into a new , less closely settled part of the town . " This is going to be our best residential district , " Mr. Mott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward added : " Our older families are moving out this way as the business district grows and takes over their homes . " Mr. Mott pointed with his cigar , which he carried between his gloved fingers as he drove , toward a large square building of yellow brick with a green roof . " See that house up yonder ? " Caroline was about to say that it would be hard to escape anything so hideous when Eddie broke in : " That 's a pretty good-looking place , dad . Who built that ? " Caroline was astounded . On their honeymoon , Edward had professed an affection for the simplicity of the American Colonial almost equal to hers . It had been practically settled that they would some day build in that style . Mr. Mott was replying to his son 's query : " Empire Lumber Company . It 's one of their complete jobs  --  everything from foundation to decorations . They even do the furnishing . They 've got connections in the furniture market . They can save the owner a lot on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll turn you out a house ready to cook dinner in . " " You do n't mean to say . . . " Caroline 's involuntary exclamation was stopped by Mrs. Mott , who turned to her . " Say what ? That they do it ? Of course they do . Wait till you see some of the houses inside . " Caroline sat back , horrified and unbelieving . The building of a home was an undertaking almost sacred to her . She had spent hours dreaming of planning hers with Eddie , evolving slowly the perfection of a feeling , of an ideal . They drove in silence for a while , over an intricate system of boulevards through what had been meadows a few months before . Paying no attention , absorbed in trying to assimilate the idea of a home on this evidently approved plan , she was jogged into realizing they were repassing the yellow-brick house . " That 's a good job , " Mr. Mott was saying . " All copper gutters . That roof alone is worth a thousand dollars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the kind . None of your gables and all spread out to eat up the coal . " Caroline 's dream house was not spread out . It could have only three gables at the most . She was about to try to interest them in it when she noticed Mr. Mott was guiding the car to the curb in front of the house he admired . They sat there , rather ridiculously Caroline thought , looking upward across a hundred feet or so of rising lawn . Suddenly she noticed curtains . The house was occupied . She looked from Mrs. Mott to Edward , from Edward to his father , wondering how they could sit staring at somebody else 's windows . Then she saw Mr. Mott had turned off the engine and was locking the car . " What do you say we go take a look ? " he asked and , without waiting for an answer , got out of the machine . Eddie helped his mother and Caroline out . On the sidewalk , Caroline 's wonder forced itself out . " The people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mr. Mott turned back to her . " It 's all right . Nobody in it . It 's just fixed up by the lumber company . People can go through it . You see , that 's part of the idea . You can sell a furnished house quicker than an empty one . " With her fear of intrusion dispelled , Caroline approached the entrance with a lively curiosity . She was about to go through a " model " house . It would be an amusing experience . Afterward she and Eddie could discuss it , agreeing on what they had n't liked . " See ? All furnished ! " Mr. Mott explained , throwing open the front door and waving them inside . He proved a voluble guide , pointing out all of the visible inducements : " Living room suite , best overstuffed . Could n't buy that davenport at retail for the price of the five pieces taking the place this way . Nice blue rug , brass andirons , three  --  no , four  --  bridge lamps , shades all different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun porch ; wicker furniture , bird cage . Get that cute little cactus plant on the table . It 's the details that count . Over here 's the dining room . Walnut table , eight chairs . Brown rug in here , you notice ; no monotony . You go through here to the kitchen . Here 's the breakfast nook . Take a look at this kitchen . Electric range , electric refrigerator , electric fan . " Now upstairs there 's . . but let 's go on up . These people do things right . Four bedrooms and a sleeping porch . Two bathrooms . Now here 's the main bedroom . Look at that bedstead . You would n't think that was only gum , made right over in Michigan , would you ? Looks like mahogany . Each bedroom in a different color . Bedclothes all in . Look in here ; linen closet , all stocked . Nothing to buy ; everything complete . All for one price ! I call that merchandising the home . " In a daze , Caroline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was aghast not only at the revelation that Mr. and Mrs. Mott accepted without question the suggestion that people would buy a home from which all chance for self-expression had been removed , but also front the chilling fear that they would some day suggest that she and Eddie take one on this same plan . Her fear reached a panic when her eyes rested on Eddie and she saw what his thralldom to his parents might mean in such a crisis . She wanted to escape , to rush down the carpeted stairs and out into the air , to get away from this terrible growing sense of being closed in . She made a mental calculation , trying to decide how soon she could get Eddie to herself and beg him never , never to consent to any arrangement for a house in Empire without consulting her . She had a premonition that he might do that . She wanted to put him on his guard , on record ; and then she was reminded that she had no assurance of any immediate privacy , an opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their future . They were back in the principal bedroom . " You 'd call this the master 's bedroom , I suppose , " Mr. Mott remarked . " Cross ventilation ; southern exposure . I know the fellow who sells them all their wallpaper . He says there 's nothing cheap about it . Mother , you 've bought a lot of wallpaper in your time . Is n't that a good paper ? " Mrs. Mott nodded approvingly . " It 's a fifty-cent paper , anyway . Fifty cents a roll , I mean , " she explained to Caroline . " Of course , " Mr. Mott went on , " there might be a few things the owners would want to change ; a few things they might want to buy . But it 's complete just as it stands . Two-car garage in the back . Thought Carrie would like to see how we do things here . You never saw it handled this way , did you , Carrie ? " Her eyes met his helplessly . She tried to smile . H @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to do something about this " Carrie . " Caroline Hastings before her marriage , she had been named for her mother . There had always been a Caroline in her family but never a Carrie . Mr. Mott laughed . " See how serious and blue Carrie is , mother . I know what 's wrong with her . We 've brought her here and showed her a fine house , all furnished and everything . We 've told her how it 's done and bragged it up and made her want one like it ! She 's probably thinking , ' Well , if this house is so grand why do n't you help Eddie and me get one ? ' Is n't that right , Carrie ? Now'fess up . I can see it in your face . This makes you want a house of your own , do n't it ? " " Why , no , Mr. Mott . Not at all . I 'm afraid that if I looked serious I was just a little tired from my trip . " She ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , children , you just come over here to the light . I want to show you something . Guess there 's no juice turned on here yet . Well , never mind ; step over here close to the window . " When they grouped around him in the light of the fading afternoon he drew a paper from his inside pocket . " Now here 's a little surprise for you . See that ? Know what that is ? " What Caroline saw was some legal-looking lettering . " That 's a deed , Carrie ; you can have your house . It 's a wedding gift . And not only a house but this very house you 're standing in ! The one that made you want a house ! It 's yours and Eddie 's . All you got to do is hang up your clothes and you 're fixed for life ! Now what do you think of that ? " As Caroline shrank away from the window , not knowing what to do , she heard her husband saying : " Why that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own and a marvelous one like this ! Caroline , that 's certainly great of dad and mother , is n't it ? " She was standing there turning her face slowly from one to the other . Her mouth was twitching and she had trouble making her words audible . " I know I am awfully queer , but you 'll have to get used to me . You will have to let me . ? . go into one of the other rooms . . . and be alone . . . for a minute . I 've got to cry a little . . . before I can say anything about it . " Eddie was standing with the deed in his hand , looking at her wonderingly as she fled . She caught a comment : " Caroline 's awfully sensitive , dad . I guess she 's just overcome with your wedding gift . " In the adjoining bedroom Caroline threw herself on the bed and stifled a terrible sob in the cerise pillow sham . " Fixed for life , " she moaned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others going downstairs . They were talking on the lawn below , and then they seemed to fade away ; perhaps inspecting the garage . Then feet bounded up the stairs and somebody pushed open the bedroom door . It was Eddie . " Coming now , Carrie ? " he whispered . She sat up on the bed and wiped her eyes . " Gee , Carrie , it 's great , is n't it ? Let 's go down together now and tell them how much we appreciate it . " She walked stiffly across to the mirror of the dressing table that had come with the house and there straightened her hat . She was calm now , calm and in full control of herself . She joined Eddie in the middle of the bedroom and stood looking at him gravely . Presently she spoke : " Do you realize that you called me Carrie just now ? " " Why , yes . I guess I did . " " You 've started to call me Carrie , have n't you ? " " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just it . You did it unconsciously . A few minutes ago I 'd have said , ' Never call me that . ' But you can now . In fact , do n't call me anything else . Do n't use the name Caroline ... any more . Now that we are . fixed for life , call me Carrie . " She opened the door and moved along the hall to the staircase , leaving him to follow .
