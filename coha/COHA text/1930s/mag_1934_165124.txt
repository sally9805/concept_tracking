On an " off the record ' ' vacation they were setting out to add more thousands to 35,000 miles the President 's wife has travelled since March 4 , 1933 . First they scuttled westward into the mountains of West Virginia to inspect the work being done by the American Friends ' Service Committee of Philadelphia among half starved children of mine families . The rich proceeds of Mrs. Roosevelt 's radio appearances for Johns-Manville roofing and Simmons beds go to this feeding and fattening cause . <P> Next morning startled Kentuckians saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River at Williamson .

By nightfall the ladies had crossed through eastern Tennessee and were at Asheville , N.

" <P> Perfectly grand ! When you have infantile paralysis you are not very strong for a few years . The Lord , I imagine , knows when he gives us things and why . . . . Many times I have thought that the very qualities that the President had to acquire as the result of infantile paralysis made it possible for him to go through the last 15 months . ...
