In 1924 the U. S. defeated Australia in one fell swoop in the challenge round for the Davis Cup , great silver symbol of international lawn tennis supremacy . Last week , on the same courts of the Germantown Cricket Club , a 1938 crop of U. S. and Australian Davis Cuppers met again in the challenge ( final ) round . <P> The team from Down Under was a twosome : 25-year-old Adrian Quist , a fifth year Davis Cupper rated by many as the world 's No. 2 amateur ; and 19-year-old John Bromwich , a sophomore who caused a sensation in international tennis last year with his either-handed , both-handed racket grip . On the U. S. side was the world 's No. 1 amateur , U. **28;1972;TOOLONG Champion Donald Budge ; his doubles partner , Gene Mako ; and 20-year-old Robert Riggs , the Los Angeles " quickie " who in two years had jumped from the municipal tennis courts to next-to-top national billing . Unquestionably the second-best tennist in the U. S. , Riggs had never before played anything but ping-pong with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was the 1938 question mark . <P> When , in the opening match of the series , cocky Robert Riggs turned himself into an exclamation point by beating seasoned Adrian Quist ( 4-6 , 6-0 , 8-6 , 6-1 ) , experts agreed that Australia had little chance of winning the Cup . Except for a brief shock the following day when the Australians took the doubles in a sensational reversal of form , the 9,000 spectators who filled the stands each day saw just what they had expected to see . Budge beat both Quist and Bromwich in routine fashion , clinched the series before the concluding match , lost by Riggs to Bromwich . <P> For the twelfth time the U. S. had won the Davis Cup , put up in 1900 by onetime U. S. Secretary of War Dwight Filley Davis .
