There are seven Swifts in Swift &; Co. , four Armours in Armour &; Co. , two Wilsons in Wilson &; Co . Last week Thomas Edward Wilson , 65 , and Edward Foss Wilson , 29 , both made news when Father Thomas was moved from president to board chairman and Son Edward from vice president to president . Wilson &; Co. ' s 9,000-odd stockholders had no good ground lo fear nepotism . For Father Thomas the board chairmanship was created , and from that eminence he announced he would continue to run the company . No matter how much Father Thomas might wish to see his red-haired boy get along , he could not have wangled the presidency for Son Edward against the will of a directorate which includes Col. Albert Arnold Sprague ( Sprague Warner &; Co . ) , Edwin Augustus Potter Jr . ( Guaranty Trust Co. of New York ) , Henry C. Olcott ( Skelly Oil ) , James MacHenry Hopkins ( Camel Co . ) . <P> Serious , hardworking Son Edward has learned a lot about the packing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on high boots , began prodding Wilson &; Co. cattle through Chicago 's stockyards . For a time he helped buy livestock , later became manager of the small-stock ( veal &; mutton ) department . Last year he was elected a director . Last week he declared : " Dad will probably be busier than ever , for in addition to his regular duties he will be teaching me the business . But maybe in five years or so he might want to spend more time riding and playing golf . " <P> As president , Son Edward 's first duty was to announce the second dividend ( $1.75 ) on the preferred stock since Jan. 1 . That left the cumulative preferred shares $24.50 in arrears .
