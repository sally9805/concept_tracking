Stiff was Mexico 's reply last week to the stiff note of U. S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull , who demanded three weeks ago prompt compensation for $10,000,000 worth of lands seized since 1927 from U. S. farmers and ranchers in Mexico . To Mr. Hull 's assertion that " The taking of property without compensation is not expropriation , it is confiscation , " Mexican Foreign Secretary Eduardo Hay replied that no principle of international law " makes obligatory the payment of immediate compensation , nor even deferred compensation , for expropriations of a general and impersonal character . . . . " <P> Seor Hay contrasted the desires of Mexicans with the claims of U. S. citizens : " On the one hand , are weighed the conquests of justice and the uplift of an entire people , and on the other hand the purely pecuniary interests of certain individuals . " This , said Seor Hay with masterly blandness , justified Mexico 's " apparent failure " to pay for what she took . <P> To show that Foreign Secretary Hay meant business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was delivered that 1,800 acres of pasture land in the State of Jalisco had just been confiscated from Dora and Oscar Newton , U. S. citizens . In point of plain fact , Mexico had told Mr. Hull to go jump in the Rio Grande ; that U. S. citizens who own little as well as big properties in Mexico will get paid for their seizure when , as and if the Mexican Government feels like it . All he proposed was that the two Governments appoint representatives to fix the value of the claims , and decide on a manner of payment in accordance with " Mexican law . " <P> Last week the Government of President Lzaro Crdenas remained financially above water largely by reason of U. S. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr . ' s continued purchases of Mexican silver . Mexico was in the grip of an economic upset . One day last week the great square in front of the Presidential Palace was turned over to the 25,000 demonstrators of the CTM ( Confederation of Mexican Workers ) . The CTM Secretary General , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deal , proclaimed : " All property owners and capitalists in Mexico are Fascists ! "
