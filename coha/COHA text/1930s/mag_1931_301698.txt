Unless Premier Richard Bedford Bennett backs down at the last moment , as few U.S. publishers think but all hope he will , on Sept. 1 Canada 's new tariff schedule on U.S. periodicals will go into effect ( TIME , June 15 , et seq . ) . The duty on magazines with more than 20% advertising would be 2 a copy ; on magazines with 30% advertising , 5 a copy . Unsold copies are included . Exempt would be educational , scientific , religious journals if they contain less than 20% advertising . Last week two periodicals took steps . They were Bernarr Macfadden 's Love Story and Western Story . They made arrangements to have their Canadian editions printed in Toronto , thus avoiding the tariff . No big U.S. publications were expected to follow suit . If &; when the tariff is levied , TIME will cost Canadians 20% . On the cover will be printed " Reason : tariff . "
