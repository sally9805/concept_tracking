txt President Roosevelt admitted this morning , after persistent questioning at his press conference , that he favors the pending bill authorizing the beginning of construction of naval base facilities at Guam . But he emphasized that the bill only calls for an authorization , not an appropriation , and that only $5,000,000 is ' 18-volved . Something might happen within a few months , the President said . which would render it unnecessary to begin construction on any part of the Hepburn program for naval bases By Implication , therefore , he supported the theory that the Guam fortification plans are part , of the general diplomatic approach to Japan , and may presage set toils and fundamental conferences between Tokyo and Washington . That view was applauded at the White House yesterday by the President 's Secretary , Stephen T. Early . Other Developments Other developments include ; Introduction of bills to authorize a $32,000,000 program of " educational orders " by the Wet ' Department to prepare factories for war orders In case of an emergency . Testimony by Brig . Gen. George J. Marshall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate defense of the American coast line against possible air attack requires establishment of 34 mobile antiaircraft regiments to supplement fixed anti-aircraft defenses . This means organizing 19 new such regiments since there are now five in the regular Army and 10 in the National Guard . HOoSevert Hard Pressed President Roosevelt had a difficult time at his press conference today , between three flies . First , there was the Adminish ation 's evident desire to make an impresslo ? on Japan with the Guam prom . second , there was the definite that Congress might take fright at such a commitment In the West Pacific ; finally , there were the urgent reporters , anxious to find out exactly where the President stands , after a lecture he read them on Jan. 17 In apparent denial of the Guaml story . Hence , when pressed , he resorted I to a long explanation o ' the diffetence between an authorization  --  which Congress may never turn into actual construction  --  and an appropriation. lie emphasized . therefore , that work on the Guam project might never begin . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Year 's resolution . Not content with this , reporters asked the President flatly whether he was for the Guam authorization . He first said he was not , implying the question to mean full and complete construction of a naval base , and then agreed that he did favor the $5,000,000 plan as now contained in the Vinson bill Hepburn Program The situation . the President said , was that the Hepburn Committee describes an ambitious program . costing perhaps $500,000,000 to $000 , - 000,000 over a tem of years . The authorization now proposed would cost from $50,000,000 to $80,000,000 . Mr. Roosevelt said he was n't bothering his head about the long range program , ho did not know what might happen , and that between now and next January circumstances may change so that the U. 8 , will not want to proceed with any of the Hepburn pi ogram . As of today , ho said , ho was in accord with the plan to begin dredging the harbor of Guam , Tho actual proposals for development at Guam are for a three year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend $1,000 , - 000 for harbor dredging and improvement .

Development of a main air base near Jacksonville , Fla , with facilities for four carrier groups , four patrol plans squadrons and ship and air repair facilities , ' Administration Views Official Administration attitude toward development of American military air strength at Guam is clarified by White House reference to a syndicated column written by Walter Lippinann on Dec. 18 . In the tight of this reference the President 's attitude can be stated In the following terms : Japan upset the status quo of , the Pacific provided by the checks and balances of the Washington Treaties , Japan denounced - those treaties and proceeded to develop bases In the mandated islands . By this action Japan upset the strategic balance In the Pacific . Japan apparently assumed that the United States was willing to allow this to be done wIthotit taking any steps to restore the balance . The only Way to meet this situation is to make it clear to Japan that renunciations are a mutual matter . It Is proposed , therefore , that Congress shall authorize a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus it , Will be brought to Japan 's attention that there must bo reciprocity . It is hoped that when Japan discovers that It can have no advantage without making some sacrifice it Will be willing to enter into negotiations which would re-establish in part at least the old equilam resulting from the nontoi ti-notion fiat cement of 1022 , Basis for Bargaining In other words the White House makes it clear that it does not intend to continue to obsetve all restrictions placed on the United States by the Washington Treaty while Japan goes ahead to develop a dominant position in the Westein Pacific . These is a disposition and apparently a desire to negotiate about the matter . But it is felt that the United States would have no bargaining position at all it Japan was in possession of actual military development in the debated area while the United States had nothing but empty proposals . If , on the other hand , Congress shows by voting authorizations and appropriations a disposition to develop Guam , then there will exist something tangible to bargain with . Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up something in return for abandonment of the Guam develop-ment , This above is the official White House position on the matter . It is not the universally held position throughout the Government . The Navy High Command really wants a base at Guam and will urge it on Congress to the utmost , But Indications are that it will prove to constitute a very important piece in diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States . Congressional action will enormously strengthen bargaining power of American diplomacy and it is apparently for this reason more than any other that the bilis were introduced in Congress , 1M-edging . Expensive The actual bills provide nothing sensatidnal . The expenditure of $1. - 000,000 In the first year to dredge Appra . harbor could probably be justified on the ground of aid to commercial air transportation alone , Pan American Airways uses Guam as a point on Its trans-Pacific route . It needs a clearer harbor than it has new for adequate commercial service . Dredging coral reefs out of mid-Pacific harbors and lagoons is an expensive operation . There is no apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the label of " fortifications . " As a matter of fact , Guam 's military importance lies in its geography and location . It becomes a fortress if enough big guns are mounted on it to keep possible enemy ships at a distance . But there is no point whatever in mounting the guns tlles. , or until its harbor is made suitable as a base for a good part of the American fleet as well as for planes . To complete a nasal base adequately covered by batteries of heavy guns would cost about 3200,000,000 . Thus the proposed $5,000,000 program for development over a three-year period can be construed only as an elementary first step toward creation of a major American naval and air base at Guam .
