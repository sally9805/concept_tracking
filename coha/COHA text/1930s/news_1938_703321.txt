txt Two strange animals soon will be mming the Chicago Zoological park at Brookfield . They will have the head of a giraffe , the legs of a zebra , and the habits of a goat , but they are okapis . Purchase of a pair of these rare animals , said by zoologists to be a holdover from the dinosaur age , was announced yesterday by Herbert E. Bradley , chairman of the park 's animal committee . Captured in the Ituri forest in equatorial Africa by members of a pygmy tribe , they will be the only pair in captivity . Four years of negotiations with the Belgian colonial office in Brussels preceded the granting of export permits , Bradley said . The okapi is slightly larger than an ox , while its head is that of a giraffe , with yellow-white cheeks and horns on the male , its neck is short , its body reddish chestnut , and its short legs striped , zebra fashion , in black and cream . And , goatlike , it defends itself by butting with its giraffe head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
