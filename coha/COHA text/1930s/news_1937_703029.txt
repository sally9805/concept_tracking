txt There is a possibility that special passenger fare reductions recently announced by several domestic airlines may result in forcing a general permanent cloy ... 12%yard revision of the industry 's rate structure . The cuts to date have been announced as temporary and as an effort to stimulate business during the usually dull winter months . On this basis , some operators express hope that higher rates will be restored when the busier spring season gets underway . Whether this view will prove justified remains to be seen , as it has been the history of the air transport industry that fare reductions seldom have been restored fully . Eventually , it is realized , a permanently lower base of rates will have to be instituted if the industry hopes to obtain a sizable share el ' the total available passenger business . While recognizing this long-range trend , leading operators believe that the industry is not now prepared to accept such a low level of rates with any hope of profitable operations . Before the industry should attempt a full competitive basis , they hold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity and lower operating costs per passenger mile . The Conservative Viewpoint The more conservative elements in the industry are of the opinion that a general reduction in passenger fares  --  prior to development of more efficient equipment  --  might be extremely injurious to the lines . Even operating on the present basis , air transport is a seasonal business from the standpoint of profits . The lines endeavor to pile up sufficient earnings during the peak summer months to tide them over the inevitable red ink entries of the winter . This is a hazardous procedure at the best and it is doubtful whether lower fares would sufficiently stimulate traffic during the normally slack seasons to compensate for the revenue cuts they would produce during peak periods . Continued losses might make it extremely difficult for some of the lines to go through with contemplated equipment purchases planned for the next year or two . The present threat to the fare structure brings to the fore the industry 's need for protective legislation similar as that under which other forms of transportation operate . The industry as a whole supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress which would have placed the air carriers under regulation of the Interstate Commerce Commission . To date none of the three leading lines has made a flat reduction in its fares . Transcontinental &; Western Air , Inc. , the only transcontinental line to make any reduction , on November S began to offer 15-day winter excursion roundtrip tickets at a 25% discount as against the usual 109i , allowed originally , it was announced that these excursion tickets would be honored for departures on Saturdays and Mondays only But an exception to that rule has already been made . To enable students returning home for the Christmas holidays to avail themselves of the lower fares TWA. will offer these excursion tickets , to students only , on any day from December 15th to 21st. inclusive , good for return within 20 days instead of 15 . Braniff Airways , which competes directly with TWA be- tween Chicago and Kansas City was the only other line to make a similar fare reduction . Other Lines Make Outs Three other Lines have announced substantial reductions in both their one-way and roundtrip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lw this month Hanford Airlines . Inc. operating between Minneapolis . Sioux City , Kansas City and Tulsa. and Continental Airlines Inc operating between Denver , Albuquei clue and El Paso , made fiat reductions of around 25 ' , in both one-way and round-trip fares As examples of the cuts . Hanford 's new one-way fare between Minneapolis and Kansas City is $15.30. against $26.06 previously and round-trip $33.30 against $46 91 . Continental 's new one-way fare between Denver and Albuquerque is $19.30 against $25 40 previously and its round-trip fare $33 S4 against $45 75 . Cuts by these lines are not extremely important , an far as the industry 's fare structure Is conce.rned . because neither competes directly with other carriers One reduction which as causing more concern is that made by Western Air Express . operating between Los Angeles , Salt Lake City and Great Falls . Montana . On December 1 WAE began to offer 30-day round-trip tickets at 1346 times the one-way fare . While this reduction does not apply to through tickets , via other lines , there is nothing to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City ticket on United Air Lines and availing himself of WAE 's excursion fare from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles By this procedure he could make the trip more cheaply than on either American or TWA . Another fare cut which might have serious repercussions is that announced by Northwest Airlines a few days ago to become effective January 1 . Described officially as " educational rates " to be in effect for 60 days , the new tales show reductions in excess of 5070 from the normal rate . This cut is particularly important because Northwest competes with United on Chicago-Pacific Northwest business . United has not determined yet whether it will meet these lower fares on its run from Chicago to Seattle .
