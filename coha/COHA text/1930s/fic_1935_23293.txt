" AST season Margaret Michaelis was acting in one of the minor hits of Le town , a comedy in which her ironic ' arms had a good scope . It was the : crest she had come to being a star New York . She began to notice at a little fame brought with it the colade of fashion , and it became shionable for men to swarm back to a-dressing room after the performLce and ask her to parties . With the stincts of her background , which inided a senatorial grandfather on one le and a provincial college president the other , she selected her parties th care and always had a good time . e was successful with people , and in ' king them respond to her beauty d her intelligence she seemed to give nm a charming task which they ; erly undertook . the was tall and beautifully made . T hair was pale whitish gold , and eyes sometimes looked lilac-colored d sometimes deep gray . All her lions were definite , crisp , with some Dle amplitude in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved in a small : le of old friends ; but that season horizon suddenly opened out and had many new kinds of social en -- ements that seemed to her almost duties to perform . ' here were many expensively apached offers of liaison made to her the men of her new acquaintance , but she rarely had the impulse to accept them , and even when she was beaued around for a while by someone she liked very much , she could n't see herself undertaking the new routine of being richly supported in return for her favors . One night some friend brought a man named Michael Breece back to meet her . Shc made her usual charming interpretation of a young star receiving thoughtlessly earned plaudits , but she saw that Mr. Breece was not even humorously responsive to this little act . He was regarding her with an intense and sober look in his black eyes . He was tall and handsomely heavy , about thirty-four years old , and marked by the details that indicated his position and its ideals . Her first impression of him remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was earnest about anything he wanted . In the next few days he was laying siege to her with great directness . She found herself unable to be " out " when he rang or called , for there was something so boyish about his attack , his dogged and yet doubtful onslaughts , that she actually encouraged him without feeling really concerned about him . He had gone to Princeton and was now married to a rich girl who had borne him two children . He was a broker in a good firm and made enough money himself to be able to dominate his wife , as anyone of his strangely nervous temper would have to do . He had played football , was physically big , had all the social assurance of his caste ; and yet Maggie was astonished to discover now and then little intimate indications of how sensitive he was , with what emotional response he met even certain business matters , and how under his athletic exterior he housed half-wistful perceptions of the life of the intellect and the arts . He never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribute of being instantly excited in her presence . This he always attempted to conceal by smoking and drawling , sitting on her mushroom silk divan in her smart apartment , and telling her with humor what a fool he had been that day in the office ; how So-and-so had come in with some deal or other and had almost persuaded him to come in on it . It was a kind of modesty he had that made him tell his little successes as if he had failed , or almost so . It had a college air of s por tsm a nshi p " in it , and she felt that no matter what experiences came to him , he probably would never completely grow up , though lie would get portly and richer and white-haired , which would make him handsome with his dark eyes and brown skin and big shoulders . He would always jump nervously from code to code , as he was doing now in pursuing her . One code which he observed was that of the almost-rich young broker with the attractive wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the country which was ideal for golf week-ends and only a jump from town when you had three cars . The other code was that of the boy who has touched ideals of secret beauty and intellectual experience in college and has never had the simple authority among his fellows to pursue them as an artist might ; failing which , he must seek it where he can and , more often than no it will be found to be the possession c some beautiful and gallant womat whose sensitivity will equal her pa sion , and whose sympathy will mak even the decent conscience of a wif betrayer feel that it is all splendid worth while . This much and more Maggie knew about him very early . Because 1 seemed so readable to her she realize with a turn of distress that she coul never really fall in love with him , as 1 besought her to do . And yet , wi even greater inward distress , she a mitted that he was physically very po ' erful over her feelings . But this w a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a feeling that cou be called passionate tolerance she I him come to her apartment with 1 little presents and see her backsta and even lunch with her , though s insisted that he bring his wife into to ' one day and that they all meet for luta ' at the Colony ; since after all it was or fair and , furthermore , there was point in starting rumors about a thi which if it ever came to pass would ha no. . . no importance , and must n have any consequences . This request hurt him . He fold his big arms and balefully nursed feelings for a few minutes ; then , wit puckering of his brow in an eff to " think through " the situation , finally agreed that she was right , an , few days afterward he brought Mi cent Breece to lunch with Magi The women liked each other imm ateiy , with that approval of each oth appearance and accent and vi which is given either instantly never . Millicent was a year or younger than Maggie , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an affectionate nature ba on a selfishness that was as simpl Michael 's bewilderment over the that he was actually wanting to be rue to her and seek beauty and passion n someone else . He seemed as restless and uncomfortLble during the lunch party as a highly wed horse in a strange stable . It was he flinching and vital nervousness of nuscular grace , and Millicent , who . new him well with a tolerance he Lever gave her credit for , wondered ; hat was ailing him . She wondered fhe was falling for Margaret Michaelis , s she had known him to fall for other iris ; but never before had such epi ) des been signalized by a family lunch ' arty . She dismissed the idea because faggie treated him with such frank nd humorous gaiety . The wife remted this a little , for it seemed to take fichael too much for granted and to 1 it be an open secret that he was just puzzled and clumsy boy who was apealing in his plans and his desires , hich were working so obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael got and left them , saying he had to be ick at the office . He cautioned them ith a superior air to leave him at least le shred of reputation after his back as turned , and made an appointment meet Millicent at four-thirty to rern to the country with her . " He would know we 'd talk about m , " said Millicent to Maggie . " I 've never known anyone so sensile with such a lot of things to be sere about , " Maggie said . " There 's u and all that health and a good ind , and plenty of money and a job really loves to whip every day . I 've m him only a few times , here and ere . One night Adrian Smith ought him back to me after the show . looked at me with grave disapoval . Does he dislike all play-tresses ? We 're a sluttish outfit of urse . " Millicent grinned . " Poor darling Mike sees himself as noth half the time . " " In pursuit of flames ? At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd been with him that night . Sometimes I simply ca n't leave the children . And Mike and I play at being modern to the extent of doing things separately if the moment seems to come along for it , without any fuss and bother . I hate it of course . But he thinks I 'm pretty highbrow and seems proud of it . So I go on and have my heartaches in private , like a proper wife  --  I really think I am a proper wife . I remember all the things now without having to stop and think of them consciously . Mike is the sort of man who 'd do all the talking about marriage being a fifty-fifty affair , and tolerance , and pulling together in everything , even the little things and so on , and then look furious or hurt if his wife so much as forgot to make one of her usual daily concessions . . . . Of course he adores the children too . I wish you 'd run out and see them when you can . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come and see mine . " " I 'll Iove to . " Maggie listened to all this talk with a simple lift of delight . It was so pleasant to see a woman like Millicent , who had so much money and belonged to such a casual generation , behave and think with ancient propriety . Millicent seemed too pretty to submit to domestication so soon . But if it seemed too bad that she had , this was overshadowed by the picture of this girl playing an intelligent game that was directed by her profoundest affections . What a fool Michael is , thought Maggie . And she thought further that his clearly desirous overtures toward her were made ridiculous now that she had had this open and refreshing glimpse into his life , and that if in even the idlest thought she should ever have confessed to herself that he was extraordinarily attractive though strangely immature , such confession must be dismissed without the littlest chance at becoming significant . Maggie felt angry with herself for this conscious adoption of a decent attitude ; but she justified it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly anxious to make love to her . She was very glad she had insisted on meeting Millicent . She had asked for it to be done in order to be seen with both Mr. and Mrs. Michael Breece in public . She knew how quickly scandal could be purveyed , for she was after all a public personage that season and would be recognized in almost any fashionable place . Now she felt that Millicent was in herself a good excuse for the meeting , and when they rose to leave the dining room and go their separate ways for the afternoon , each felt very friendly toward the other and knew more or less the other 's measure : Millicent a pretty and mild girl with some curious strength below her wistful and quiet air , and Maggie a beautiful young woman with a somewhat grand air of ease under which were feelings that blew hot and cold with doubts and emotions and conjectures . In other words , each recognized in the other the very qualities that made her suited to what she was  --  actress or matron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , a small French Iandaulet which she occupied with the exact suitability of a kitten in a basket , and promised to send her tickets for her play . That night after the theater was empty and the last of her visitors had left her dressing room , Maggie was surprised to see Michael standing beyond the departing callers in a shadowed area of the stage , watching her and waiting . When her friends had gone he came forward and spoke her name . She nodded quickly at him and he went by her into her dressing room . She slammed the door and faced him with annoyance . " Michael , what are you doing here I thought you were going back witl Millicent this afternoon . " He folded his hands complacently ii front of him and dandled his hat any smiled at her like a sly child who ha been bad but whose charm will save al unpleasantness . " I ca n't explain a thing , " he saic and she caught the first hint of th quivering that sometimes came into rich voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good husband ; and thei I show up wherever you are , and that all there is to it . I sent Millie hots alone because I had some wires to gi off to our Chicago office . . . . Wel damn it , I did And I am glad waited , because some messages came to us from Rod Hampton out ther and I was there to handle them .. Oh lord , Maggie " He suddenly looked miserable . SI watched the blush creep brownly up It face , and her feelings were divided l tween exasperation and a kind of afft tion that exasperated her also . " Now , Mike darling , this whole bu ness is too difficult for any more wort After meeting Millicent to-day ai then seeing you come here like this know how silly it all is . Why do you really look at things ? " He shrugged as if he were perfec willing but unable to . " I love you , " he said . The door opened and Maggie 's m came in with some clothes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Her tactful disinterest mo Maggie to push Michael out of the d and tell him to wait until she dressed . In her tone was a clear int tion of bringing about an understarl ing with him for once and for all . When she joined him he was in a IT , mood of buoyant cheerfulness. proposed that they go and dance . " We 're not dressed , " she object " and I 'm really tired . " " We could go to a honky-tonk and ) retend we were from the Bowery. end do n't be tired . I feel alive for the irst time to-day . . . . Lunch was awul , was n't it ? " She stopped and pulled him to face ter in the alley that led from the stage loor down to the street . She shook us sleeve . " Mike , we have to settle this . Ca n't ou see ? Why should lunch be awful nless you felt guilty ? You know here 's nothing for us to feel guilty bout . And you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He answered her by taking her and issing her hotly . In the shadowed leyway there was a precarious privacy , e was flooded by furious happiness d he held her tenderly . He was ntle with her , which surprised her ; n- from his strength and curious hairigger poise she had thought him al.ost brutish in his needs . " Mike ! " They parted . She walked out to the lewalk and he followed . He hailed 0 taxi . In silence they got in , and ' ove to Maggie 's apartment . She , uld hear him breathe . His excite-t t lasted . In the cab , intermit-idy lighted as they drove , he watched a-to see if his kiss had bred any reonse in her . His pulse was troubling m by its delicate race . He was per-Illy thoughtless ; a sweet sensual wit- ; sness governed him . When they went into the apartment tried to match Maggie 's air of casualss . But they were both frank with ch other as soon as they were alone . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to his iderness in that embrace made Mag ! want to treat him gently , with the fling reasonableness she would use th a child . The more he stormed d knit his black brows over his brown , ? . s and his red-brown cheeks , and ached her with his trembling fingers , the more she would laugh ruefully at him and protest that she did n't lave him , though she liked him so much and found so much in him that was strong and charming and fine . " Oh , but I could make up for what you might lack in loving , " he said . They were on the mushroom-colored silk divan in front of the ivory fireplace , and he half rose over her on his knee , sinking into the cushions . " You would simply behave like a lecher then , " she said lightly , looking at him with her eloquent eyes that begged him not to be so furious and so insistent . " Damn it , that 's not so ! You ca n't imagine the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing much bigger than I am , Maggie . It 's a pure feeling . By pure I mean something that is so right that it must be good . . . . Oh , Maggie ! " She got him a highball , and he drank it instantly with indifference and returned to his siege . She asked him what he wanted . Did he want her to say she loved him ? Or did he simply want . . He turned away and ground his palms into his eyes in a baffled and masculine gesture of struggle . He told her that he loved her altogether and that he wanted her with her love ; but if she could n't give him that , then he simply had to admit that he wanted her anyway . He hung his head because this admission shamed him . It was in some obscure fashion a betrayal of one of his various codes . It seemed dimly to imply to him that his standards were let down here if he admitted Iust without the beauty of a whole relationship into his plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she felt in him that Maggie leaned forward and put her hands on his near shoulder to make him know she did n't mind his words and the physical thrust in him that made him utter them . He turned with his face suffused in hope , and she saw what a mistake it had been to touch him . Unbelievably enlivened by so slight a contact , he was shaken and unable to speak and he grasped her arms , then let them fall and took her head and held it in an agony of indecision , and then kissed her again with a sudden birth of luxurious ease in his breast , some sop to turmoil . And here the unschooled core of his nature was direct and eloquent . Taking his kiss and resolving never to let him kiss her again , Maggie felt a sudden understanding of the force that drove him so toward such trials as this . He was sensual beyond anyone she had ever known , and in a way that was astonishing because of the preconceptions that his boyishness , his brokerage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had a deepening of respect for the generally good way in which he met the tempestuous challenges of his nature ; and when she freed herself from his arms her opinions were changed but her intentions were not . " No , Michael , darling , no ! " He smiled at her with accomplishment and now believed that his heart was going to be calmed at last . But she stood away from him , and in a moment they were off on another flood of talk that hurt them both and that made him wrathful and petulant . Again she thought of the spoiled child as the simplest image for him , and she laughed inwardly when it occurred to her that he probably had all the women he ever snapped his fingers at . She had no holier-than-they feeling , for his physical demand brought a welling response from her , which was just what made him so confident ; and he looked so amazed when she said he had to go home . In vain he protested again that he was mad about her , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between a man and a woman than the feeling that he had now , etc. ; that afte all they were two grown people , an , could look life in the face and nc flinch , etc. ; that if she would only  --  wh then . . . " Why , then you 'd succeed in Milli ( izing me and go on to someone else . . . Oh , wait : 1 know you 're perfectl sincere , Mike , and I believe you mea it when you say you love Millie and th children and when you say that it 's po sible for a man , especially a robust an sensitive man , to have more than or sincere love in his life at the same tim And all that . And you are terrib attractive in just that way . You ju have n't any sense , and the whole this would be dangerous , and that 's th- ' No , go home now , my dear boy . " He told her miserably not to take all so seriously then . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his love for h was grave and deep and absorbin She saw that he was resorting to ai means . And she was touched , but u moved to decide in his favor . He t came petulant again , and his handsot face darkened and his lower lip car forward in a pout , and she thought needed a lecture about self-pity and vulgar shelter for bruised feelin She was glad when he finally got up go , looking at her soberly again a trying to clear in his puzzled eyes t gaze into the future which would bri him the rewards he sought and felt deserved . She thought and said that he better not see her again ; to which replied with a tightening of his mo and a kook almost of hatred . With speaking , he conveyed to her some hp of the stubbornness of his characterJ trait which all his schools had assn him was essential in order to get ah in the world , and which so far his perience had confirmed as his mi valuable asset , after allowing for good looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch upon women . Maggie sighed and shook his hand , saying then that of course he could come and see her again , if only lie would let them have a less difficult time together . When he was gone she felt a little sorry that she had been so hard with him ; for he had had none of the usual masculine craftiness about him in such moments . She could n't imagine him : alking about her to any other man in ; tag trophy sessions . Nor could she magine him capable of any of the usual tmorous tricks that she was used to toticing in her suitors . He was inept tnd he was helpless almost in seeking ! xpression for his inner struggles . She vas sure his pride had been hurt ; but nore than that , she was sure that he vas simply unable to understand his allure . ' But if she expected the solution and elief that she wanted in this tangle , he was denied both , for Michael came lack the next day in the afternoon and at , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only able to feel and pour out the bitter rebuke of that eling on her as if to weigh her down f ith guilt , and so exhaust her , and ring her hungry to his arms . ; She tried the usual ruses to bring him ut of his deep melancholy , but they 11 failed . The best she could rouse im to was a bitter laugh . She would at angry with him , and say to herself , nd want to say it aloud , that he was a diculous baby , prodded by his vanity no this courting , which had she given i to him would have no significance 31. - either of them . Rejected , he had ID pursue it and so keep his self-esteem . t other times , she had another wave of . eling , something of tenderness , and hen she would express it to him ' ways that apologized for her light ' difference , he would say in his ch low voice that was unconsciously - and : " I do n't want your pity if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every time he came to her apartment or to her dressing room or came to take her to lunch at obscure speakeasies where they would unlikely be bothered by acquaintances . She told him directly one day at lunch that he was being a terrible bore , that she had made allowances for his flattering dejection , but she could n't be bothered going round much longer with such a bitter and moping face as he was wearing . " If you feel so badly about it why do you insist on seeing me ? " she said . He groaned and promised to cheer up if only she would n't stop seeing him . There followed an even more trying interlude of ghastly gaiety on his part , which was ended in an astonishing way . He came to her apartment one morning about eleven , beaming with hope and greeting her with an almost condescending air , as if he had discovered something which gave him the whip hand . She was lying on the floor in the sun-hay of her drawing-room in a pair of white-linen trunks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maid let him in without comment , having been used to him for weeks . When he saw Maggie nearly nude his self-confidence faltered and he spoke in an unsure voice . But she made the best of it and threw him a cigarette and told him to sit down . He watched her in the bright light for a moment , and then his other intention returned , and he assured her with dignity that if it was Millicent who stood between them , much as he liked her , he would get a divorce and would be then free to ask Maggie to marry him . This was her first indication of how seriously he thought of her It terrified her instantly . Some whispered instinct told her later that it was a thing he would never do ; that he made this abandoned gesture to prove his love as an Elizabethan gentleman might swear in a sonnet that roses ' thorns my love doth change to lips . But now seeing him there , sitting above her , looking down at her with a rich smile of accomplishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant it ; and she was so worn out by the weeks of difficulty she could thank him for that she now pushed her sun-glasses up on her forehead and began to cry , rubbing at her eyes with the backs of her hands . " Mike , you 've got to clear out and stop all this , " she said . " I ca n't stand much more of it . " She had never displayed this kind of feminine expression before to him . He was contrite in a second and knelt down , feeling some thickness like tears in his own throat ; and again he was tender with her , self-reproachful ; and touching her in consolation , he was also longing to kiss her . She stopped her tears almost at once , lighted a cigarette , and threw over her a flannel dressing gown that was lying on a chair , " I 'm going to call up Millicent and ask her to come and see me the next time she 's in town , " said Maggie . " I wo n't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the best thing for me to do is cultivate her and be such good friends that this whole thing will have to solve itself by petering out . She 's a sweet and clever person . I like her tremendously . " " Oh , that 's unfair . That 's pretty low , " said Michael . " Do n't you think it 's hard enough on me without dragging this into my family ? " So they wrangled without solving anything until she sent him off to let her get ready for a lunch engagement . But she was tired and listless and she realized with alarm that she was being too much distressed by the agonies Mike surrounded her with . Her work in the play was suffering . She became aware of it that night , when her most amusing , brittle moments of comedy went over the footlights without bring ing alive that ripple of suspense ant delight she was accustomed to creating Thoughts about this worried he deeply ; the one thing in life she longec to excel at was her job on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her education in dramatic expression . After tha performance she faced her mirror alone , refusing to see anybody , sendin out word that she had a headache , an imagining bitterly that her visitor would nod to one another and say , " 0 then that was it ; that 's why she wasn so good to-night . " She rubbed her make-up off slow through , and she thought it looked grnal and saw her unheightened face com and older , with hollows that betrayei strain . Her voice was tired ; her throa ached a little ; she promised herse angrily to resolve this business c Michael Breece as soon as she saw hir again . She could n't stand this cot stant uncertainty , the wrangling , thi bitterness , and the atmosphere of n proach any longer . If it was comi to the point where her work , the ru ' of her play might suffer , then it w high time to send him off , with h vanity unslaked . Having taken a stand , she devot herself with a new sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theater for the night . She fe younger , like a little girl who glori in her nursery possessions and touch all the objects in her doll 's house a with that touch knows the best of a , worlds : the one of now ; and when sk was at last ready to go and had sent In ' , maid off , she was ready to sleep wit honest fatigue . But there he was , waiting for her the door , talking to the doormat Ready to be final with him , she more less welcomed the chance to be so once . She took his arm , pulling out of the theater with a nervous enerf hat surprised him and gave him hope . " This uncertainty has got to end , " he said when they had once again eached her apartment after one of heir taxi rides in which an emotional ilence had kept them tense . " I derided that to-night . I 'm giving perectly rotten performances , and the whole thing is wearing me out much nore than I was aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm so tired , o awfully weak about it all . " She sounded . brisk . But her heart was pounding , and she watched him in uspense . He could n't act ; she knew that from is past attempts at gaiety in the midst f gloom . Now his face actually rhitened until he looked faint . His ves dried and burned with emotion . Ie had to lick his lips to speak , then auld think of nothing to say . It was se most dreadful sight she had ever ! en ; and when she knew that this was suffering all her heroic and ' omardy decisions seemed like nothgig . He was mutely trying to organize is thoughts ; when he could finally ) eak he told her with an agonizing Jumility that he wanted her pity now only that if it was all she had to give im . Nothing could be so disturbing as se collapse of a strong man . She relined only one shred of sense in this ew facet of complication , and that as to change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one had nought nothing but misery and uncerLinty to them both . She watched Mike stand up and ring back some kind of control over imself . But he could n't do anything 7 ) the tears that formed slowly and eamingly on his lower lashes except lot them down on his cheeks with his embling thumbs . This was the final position of his character , the last - unrstanding of his gentleness and his 1sirousness and his sensitiveness , threequalities which she never could reconcile with his burly and handsome person . On art instant 's decision , born of weariness and some little echo of his ache that came from her long familiarity with him and his constant preoccupation about her , she went to him and put her arms round his neck , and kissed . him . His heart slowed and thumped and came up from its stumble into excitement . With a wild slowness he gathered her in his arms and savored her kiss . So they ended their uncertainty . But not their suffering , as they both discovered afterward . He made a tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more intimately , she said to herself that the compassion , the enlivenment of a moment had betrayed her into the guard of a man who was appealing but had nothing that demanded her respect other than his gestures of love . He had really nothing that she demanded of a husband or a lover . Shc had been loved before ; she had never really been able to fall in love ; her mind demanded realities constantly ; and most men , aside from their hours of erotic play , had none to give her . So it was with Mike . She was his mistress for three months and all that time she knew she must resist building any concern around him or letting him believe he had a hold over her . Often she thought how much cleverer she would have been if she had sent him off as she had planned to that night . Many times she wondered how she would actually end the affair as it had to end . Mike was restored to a kind of happiness by their relationship though now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his jealousy , and even had to know by intuition when he was feeling guilty and remorseful about Millicent , and at such times , simply to keep things agreeable , she found herself in the comic role of a mistress who assures her lover that his wife is a very tolerant woman , one who would understand and forgive and bless if the whole truth could be known to her  --  which for reasons of convenience it were much better not . How much better not , Maggie was able to imagine one day at lunchtime when she went into the Ritz by herself . Millicent was sitting with another woman a few tables away from Maggie 's . Their eyes must meet soon enough . When they did the two women smiled and waved their hands , and presently , when the woman with Millie was summoned by a waiter to take a telephone call , Millicent waved to Maggie to come over and join her for a moment . Eyes followed Maggie as she crossed the room . She was aware of it and accepted it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes under a little hat that made her look very dashing . " Where have you been all this time ? " she declared , taking Maggie 's hand and pulling her down to the chair beside her . Maggie looked frankly at her . Through her mind were racing thoughts and conjectures : how much did Millicent know or suspect ? Why had their first meeting led to nothing further in friendship ? Mike was such a fool that he could hide nothing , Maggie thought . She was not a woman to lose her self-possession readily ; but now her pulse faltered and hurried , and she resorted to one of her stage gestures to gain a moment of control . She leaned her elbows on the table and clutched her fingers wittily under her chin and looked up at Millicent with a silent smile , as if to extend a charming moment and save it forever . At last she said : " I 'm perfectly furious with you . You never came to my play . " " You never sent tickets . I 'm raging at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenged each other with crossed wit and words that veiled what they wer really thinking of . " Oh , but I told the box office to sent them . Do you mean to say you neve got them ? That 's too disgusting . " " I really wanted to come , " sai Millie . " I wanted to know an awf lot more about you . Everyone sa you are perfectly swell in the par Mike simply raves . " " Oh , I try , " said Maggie . It would have been too clever Mike to rave . He would instead ha fumbled and tried everything in social power to keep Maggie 's na out of his house . " That is , " said Millie , " when I s him , which is on rare occasions now . " " Oh ? " " Oh , you know what I mean , darlin It 's just that lately he 's away a lot i the evening . But there 's a perfect ' stupendous deal on with some Chicag office , and if Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't have count pennies when I order brocco ' and get the babies their little Par frocks . Some brokerage firm out thei ? it 's more or less a secret negotiation , and both Mike and the chap at tt . other end , Rodney Hampton , seem have to do their dealing after busine hours , by long-distance and priva wire . . . I do hope Mike will pull off . He 's been wanting to take fi abroad for years ; and he insists that A has to pay for the whole trip . We CZ go if he manages to put Rod Hamptc into the bag . Rod 's a Yale boy . Mil would simply adore doing it . Ir4 probably do n't know my husband we enough to know that he 's never real " For that matter , " said Maggie , " I ' , grown up .

I always tell Mike when he gets romantic about some tanned golf girl at the Downs Club to go the whole hog . That always spoils his fun and makes me feel rottenly mean . But ' these twentieth-century grand passions in sporty Packard roadsters .. . " " I know , " said Maggie . She was wretchedly uncomfortable . This was a passage that sooner or later would have occurred , and she had fortified herself with various expedients to meet it when it came , all of which failed her now . She was perfectly certain that Millicent knew the whole story about Michael and her ; the was equally sure that , though it roust have hurt her , it distressed her less than it did Maggie herself . Further , Willie was the mistress of the present 1 ; ituation . She clung to the surface sith ease and charm , making double ' leanings and sly , sophisticated jabs without the faintest appearance of ivarreling or even rebuking ; she was nerdy , in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ter clumsy husband 's latest helpless rbsession . It was Millicent 's serene ureness of Mike 's final allegiance that nade Maggie feel so cheap . If only he were able , herself , to respond to Mike with a fury equal to his own , then here would be something to fight for n the presence of the wronged wife . 3ut even that shred of dignity was de-Lied her , and Maggie was wildly conidering for a moment marching Millient out to a cab , and driving around tobile she made the confession she felt he must make , some washing clean of . ei ; self in the waves of honesty that yelled up in her now . 11 But the other woman came back . Millicent introduced her and begged Maggie to stay on for the rest of the lunch ; she begged her with such easy grace that Maggie 's feelings changed a little and she forgot that Millicent had the right to torture her if she could , and she rose abruptly , with that beautiful pose of command and style she used on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken with a simplicity equal to Millicent 's own , so that people nearby were unable to decide which woman was the more graceful and brilliant , she went back to her own table , taking with her at last the vote of the restaurant public as the most beautiful and severely smart woman in the room . There were comments at various tables . Having been identified , Maggie knew that there would be some talking about her . She did n't know that her few evidently lighthearted words with Mrs. Michael Breece would by three o'clock be an addition to the Broadway legend that sucked and dragged with refuse at public figures as the oily water belched and sighed up against the piles of the docks in the East River . To have seen the actress laugh and talk with the wife she has foxed was a fragment to be relished by the observers and the later hearers . That night Maggie 's performance was extremely difficult for her . She felt listless and a little hot . Her arms weighed heavily in her attitudes . Some accent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a new way , and she was astonished to feel a response from them that weighed on her even more , seeming to create for her a responsibility that she was reluctant to take ; but at the end of the play there was a demonstration , and she came to the curtain time after time , feeling that she might faint at any moment , and she sustained herself against that , deciding that she was simply in an emotional state , and the people clapping for her touched her more than usual . At last when she was free of the stage she felt cold and weak . But the callers crowded back , more than had come for months . She waved them all away , thinking even in her curious vague distress that this evening , with such a strange acceleration of the play 's effectiveness , would probably carry the run even longer , and she was delighted with the sudden deepening of her powers though she could not exactly explain it . In the morning she woke up and could hardly move . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dizzy . So this , she weakly mused , was the reason for her little triumph last night ! She had influenza or something like it ; and the first weakening had given her some pathetic , softened expression in the comedy that usually she played with brisk skillfulness . She rang for her maid . In due time the doctor came . He forbade her to think of rising , much less playing that evening . They telephoned the theater to notify the understudy . The blinds were slatted down against the light . In the afternoon flowers arrived . At dusk Mike was refused admittance by the nurse who had arrived to take command . He scrawled a wild and terrified note on the margin of the evening paper and sent it in , promising to come back in the evening and sit in the drawing-room to be near if she wanted any-. thing . " Rodney Hampton indeed , " thought Maggie as she read the note that fairly seethed with his indignation at her having been made to give in to this system which separated them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for other reasons . As the days dragged on and she got through the most exhausting phase of the disease , her strength began to come back , and she was allowed to sit up and read a little . Her throat would not improve . The laryngitis was stubborn . She was forbidden to talk . She was denied the smallest excitement ; for the doctor told her that throat troubles , especially / She was not permitted to see anyory for ten days . Every day Mike came bringing flowers or toys or books . brought a furry toy cat , whose eye moved slyly and whose insides playei a music box tune when its belly wd squeezed in and out . He wrote in hi prep-school hand on a card at the cat ' neck , " Pussycat , pussycat , where ha you been ? " which made her feel full foolish tears suddenly and gave a me ancholy bravery to her decision to sen him off the minute she could . other time he sent her a telegram fro his office , announcing that " bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de grace , " and she w reminded of how Millicent had spok of Mike putting Rod " in the bag , " a it gave her a curious imagined Om into their intimacy in which certaii phrases were common to husband a i wife , each unconsciously echoing t other , sharing as their right whatever each other 's personalities they woulc She was glad that Mike was about to L successful in his business deal and fe ? ful of what would happen to him wh she told him her mind . The weather was now changing fro the winter waste to the early enthu asm of spring . She would see t aspect of the change day by day fro her window in the hotel towers that overlooked that part of town . When evening came with violet and pale gold in the sky and the lights she felt some stir in her aspirations , some emotional response to a beautiful picture that happened before her eyes . She was eager to be back in her comedy , doing her job , earning her existence . At last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little airing one afternoon . She could take a taxi and ride through : he park , well bundled up . If that iid n't tire her and irritate her throat , hen a few days later she could almost : ertainly go back to the play . The unlerstudy was adequate , the managenent said ; but the daily calls about her : ondition and appeals for her return indicated how business at the box office vas dropping off ; and the play would urely go under if she did n't come back o it soon . It was suddenly that Mike and her return to health overlapped . She was ) reparing for her taxi ride , and he phoned her apartment , wheedling her o let him see her . She said that was napossible ; she was going out this very Ininute for a ride in the park , to get ome of her strength back . " Then let me come along ! " " But there is n't time . I am going iglu out . You wo n't get up from iowntown in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He made a rueful sound . She was rry but impatient , and when he hung p abruptly she felt that a gloom was ifting . But when she reached the Dbby , stepping from the elevator , he ias there , grinning at her over his - ) lcled arms like a child who has played joke . k " I was down here all the timer ' he aid . " I am coming with you ! " They went to the street . He had a ab waiting . His happiness was al-lost witless . He took her for grantedwith a pleasure in their status , bundling her up and paying her little attentions that she knew would never be paid again . She felt tired and white and nervous ; but her mind was really made up . Mike directed the driver . They turned off Fifth Avenue and headed into the Park , where the little low hills had a green glow over them . He took her hands and sat half facing her . " I 've hated these three weeks ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reunion . " You do n't look at all sick , do you ? Can you talk yet ? Is your voice better ? " " My voice is all right . And I am wobbly as an old cat . . .. You were very dear to send all the things . I love my musical kitten . " He sighed and sat back and relaxed his big body as much as the cramped cabin of the taxi would let him . He rolled his head on the cushions and gazed with bland approval out of the window . " How many lovers have to thank the Park ! " he said . " I 'm glad to join them . Think of the meetings here , a little tame wilderness in the cityl " " And the partings , " said Maggie . She said it eloquently . As on the night of her last performance her oncoming weakness had given her words an extra and pathetic tone , so now her absolute firmness of mind was expressed through her sad voice and pale face . Michael was apprehensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " Ycs , but what of it ? " he said . " I 'm calling a halt , Mike . We are not going on . Ever . " The cars rolled by them , and the tires squashed rolling fatly on the purplish gray pavement . She closed her eyes to wait for whatever was coming . Nothing happened . She looked at him then , and saw him grinning at her in complete self-confidence , shaking his head slightly , and thrusting his jaw forward a little , making a smiling face of tolerance for such nonsense as she had talked . He felt masterful and tender both . She 's been upset , he said to himself . I 'll have to coddle her a little . His breast swelled with appreciation of this wisdom of his , this aspect of love which made him love his own feeling as much as it did hers . He was stirred and puzzled by the happiness that his reaction gave him . He felt bodily close to her . She knew all that . She put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She said it this time with an acid directness , looking at him with snapping eyes . " 1 mean it . There 's too much confusion and effort and inconvenience about all of it . It ca n't go on . You know and I told you long ago that nothing can interfere with my job . I 'm afraid this does , Mike , and that 's all . If I could belong to you altogether nothing would matter . But I ca n't ; you 've known it . I 'm going to tell the taxi man to turn and go home , and kiss you good-by and get out . You 've got to drive on and forget us . " She leaned forward , but he took her hands and pulled her back . He was white with anger . His dark eyes spilled flashes of light and temper . He was trembling . His sensual content of a moment before had turned to rage . He flung her back into her corner of the cab and shook her a little bit , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of the enormous provocation there was to do it . " Let go , Mike . Be sensible . " " God damn you , Maggie ! " he said , with a dry gasp . He let go and looked at her wrists where his fingers had made marks . Then he swung round and lay over in his corner of the taxi and leaned forward , resting his head on his hands and his elbows on his knees . He began to make sounds like weeping , but he struggled to control them , and she watched him battle with his feelings , having in her mind only an impatient compassion which made her feel guilty . She really had affection for him , and her love-making with him , though it had so little reality for her , had after all claimed something of him for her life , whether for good or for bad . Now she watched him . He was brokenhearted and was trying to hidq it . Awkward half-movements came through to his muscles , and he twined his fingers and ground them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and softening as he clenched his teeth . He was like the college foot ball player upon whom the fate of th game rests ; upon his catching of th forward pass , which he misses , an fumbles , and thereby causes the gam ( to be lost . In other words , a genuint cause for feeling was in him ; at th ( moment nothing could seem more ' Mai portant than the game ; no feeling couk be more sore and abandoned than tha of emotional failure . His expressio of all this now was not quite adult . I was undergraduate , and none the les sincere , but less affecting than du suffering of one who could be though of as an adult , a mature character witl perceptions that were more than wist ful and a capacity for sympathy th contained more than utterly unco scions selfishness . Presently he began to speak . Sh hardly recognized his voice . H begged her to be less hard with hi His eyes roamed dimly over her fac and her body . He looked older an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought that perhaps shc , had never given him credit for feelir4 so deeply as he seemed to now . Sh:1 told herself to talk as little as possibl to him , and so spare him the hurtf things she would say if once they be to discuss her reasons in detail . L him think their liaison distressed he ; work by intruding too much upon he emotional life . Let him have that to reflect on a few weeks hence , and he would see that such an explanation had some flattery in it . Let him not exasperate her to the point of saying that he had her for three months because she was sorry for him and bored by his sulking and only excited now and then by his hot clumsiness that was still so surprisingly gentle . If she had to tell him that she had no respect for him at all , and that he was incapable of any kind of love richer than a schoolboy 's , and that his need of her was a trivial one alongside the needs and respects upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the most petulantly selfish man she ever knew , and that kvhat she had done under his will was cheap and faithless , he would simply not believe her . Therefore , she poured tender and pitying looks at him when he begged her with his eyes to keep him by her , and shook her head . The air had a sudden chill stricken into it as they turned back to Fifth &venue.; The lights were coming on . The felt another kind of sadness at : his revisitation of evening . She was . hocked a little at her unconcern for ? lichad , who sat beside her in silence low , controlled and wearing an in.cru table expression that proclaimed stubbornness . While she thought , ' He has reached the stage of wounded anity , " he was thinking that she was nistaken if she expected to toss him werboard so lightly . It was actually ntolerable for him to think of never naking love to her again . What a ) erfect arrangement it had beenl he hought . He would not lose it ightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taxi and in ilcnt formality escorted her to the cleiator . His dignity reached out to her Ivith a little appeal , and she found after ill that saying good-by was not so easy is she had expected . " Good night , Maggie , " he said . " I am coming back . " " No , no , Mike ; it would only be all this over again . I am serious . " He drew her aside from the waiting elevator , behind a screen of still boxwood trees . He grasped her arm . " Well , if you are serious , then so am I. God damn it ! . . . You have never known what this means to me ? I 'd kill myself , Maggie . " She felt a thrust of terror in her breast ; but it was too fantastic to listen to . " Oh , Mike , do n't be classic ! " she said , smiling and patting his hand on her arm . " Good-by , my dear . I ca n't mean all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awfully dishonest with you , and myself . Now I 'm really tired . I feel pretty weak . Let me go , Michael , and go yourself and chalk us up to profit and loss . Do n't hate me . I 'm not worth that either . . . . Good-by , dar-ling . " Be thought hotly that she was being too charming . If she wanted him to go why did she look so beautiful or speak so lowly in such warm tones ? He felt a little sick from apprehension and desire . He began to think how his words , his awful threat , had sounded in his own ears . It terrified him and brought him face to face with loneliness . He reached toward her . But she gathered her furs and went quickly by him and into the elevator . The solid doors rolled closed . He stood watching the little ascent of the signal light that showed the rise floor by floor of the car in its shaft . The little golden lights fled upward in the small bronze panel beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His mind made him a picture of her stepping out into her little hallway on the twentieth floor which was always filled with flowers  --  his flowers latterly . He thought he had never seen her so vividly as in that moment , watching the elevator signal of her progress . In a second the little electric flashes showed him the elevator coming down again . He turned and went out of the lobby , feeling desolate and wanting comfort . He thought in the back of his mind that he wanted to be in Millicent 's bedroom , receiving comfort and consolation from her , his wife , for woes that she did n't know about , and that obviously could not be told her . He got into a taxi and drove away aching . A few days later the management announced in special advertisements that Margaret Michaelis was returning to the cast , and would continue as leading player for the duration of the play 's run . The audience for the occasion was a little larger than any that had come to the play during Maggie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in readjusting herself to the play 's convention . It seemed to her somehow without core , without meaning ; and as she thought of it later , she concluded that it was really she herself who was unfocused and so unable to feel heart and soul in her work . The break had been bad for all of them  --  the producer , the leading actress , the author , the rest of the cast , the press agent , the audiences . The closing notice was posted backstage . If Maggie had been mainly the reason for the play 's success before , then her absence was the reason for its being forgotten by the public , and her return to the cast seemed to have little effect in reviving its popularity . But what should she do ? The news got round soon enough , and managers brought her plays with the usual promises made seriously and meaning nothing , as she well knew . Her doctor advised her to take a long vacation . None of the plays she read had anything for her . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose ends and more shaken than she had known by the winter 's passage with Michael . She had not heard from him since their ride through the Park . Once or twice she realized that she was anxiously looking at the newspapers to see if . . . but as soon as the thought became conscious she dismissed it with angry humor . The last nights of the play 's run were depressing ; for what had been a betterthan-average success was now simply petering out in giving the required number of performances after the posting of the closing notice . Maggie bought a few small presents for some of the members of the cast who had played important supporting roles . The sentiment of the stage was an easy thing to succumb to . The actors and actresses were eager to know what she was going to do ; and one night she said on impulse that she was going to California and lie in the sun and not think about anything . To give the closing of the play a last shred of grandeur , the press agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood to discuss her possible acceptance of various impressive offers from the film studios . It was as good an explanation as any other . The early summer was already sugt gested in the weather . She left foi California one hot night in May . She was honestly surprised to find reporter ! at the train to interview her on her de . parture . All of them kept speaking of the movies ; she was gay and evasive about answering them , and they con cluded from her discretion , whit masked the fact that she had had nO offers and would n't film well anyway that there was a great big story abou# to break concerning this latest of Nei York actresses who was forsaking tht stage for the fabulous land of tht camera . They played it up the next morning , using her picture , and hinted stridently at the secret war that was goi 1 ing on among the Hollywood produ i ers , of whom the victor would be the one whose offers finally gathered in this star . The New York offices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all disturbed , each discovering that only his company , evidently , had failed to see the marvelous potentialities of Margaret Michaelis . Wires hummed across the country in long-distance calls ; a few people were fired from their jobs  --  a few minor people ; and when she got to Chicago the following day Maggie found awaiting her a delegation of reporters and a Mr. Morris Bloch , who ran the Chicago offices of one of the great movie companies . She posed on her Pullman step for a photographer , and Mr. Bloch managed to be standing in the picture , looking up at her with a smile from which only a cigar was missing . Then hunching his tightly tailored shoulders and raising his thick loriental eyebrows above his onion-colored eyelids , he said to her in a whisper that he simply had to talk with her , and she must give him only a chance to explain his proposition on behalf of his " awganization " and sign a contract before going a step farther toward the Coast . He said he had had instructions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was amazed and full of protests . But since she had three hours before the California Limited was to leave , she agreed to go with him to the Drake for something cool to drink . Her mind was already made up , hough . On Mr. Bloch 's soap-colored race was already the self-contented ; mile of success . He was a small man , Ind so tailored that all his buttons and laps and lapels and paddings seemed 3rominent . His voice had a gentle ) uzz to it and he made great point of peaking " expressively , " by raising and ? owering the pitch as he spoke , thus ' thieving emphasis and ingratiation , is he thought , over a running scale of ntervals . He was constantly looking round to notice if he were being watched , and always concluded with gratification , on the slimmest evidence , that he was indeed . This gave him enormous belief in the importance of his affairs ; if after all he attracted spies , that much was clear . Maggie sat opposite him at the Drake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties were in the big dining room , which was softly lighted . There he talked earnestly , never dropping the smile that maneuvered his lips as if they had been made of rubber . She hardly bothered to listen to what he said but only watched him and sipped her cool drink , thinking about the idleness she wanted so much and the warm seaside she was going to , where so many things could be automatically solved by her drenching herself in rest . Mr. Bloch was mentioning extraordinary sums of money , screen tests , and the rest of the usual approach to the movies . At all costs , be repeated , his company had to have her . Would they have sent him to meet her , he asked , if they had n't wanted her so badly ? Did she see any other film company executives standing at the train to meet her ? His vehemence mystified her more than ever . The New York newspaper zeal , based on conjecture , had made her a pawn among the gaming producers ; but she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested , a statement that he had not even acknowledged the first time she had said it . It was simply inconceivable to him that he could fail in bestowing what he had good reason to know every American girl would give he-knew-what for . She smiled , and he thought she 'd be a knockout in " pitchas . " She said : " You see , Mr. Bloch , I 'm an actress , and if I belong anywhere , I belong on the stage . Frankly I do n't like your movies . Besides , I 'm going away for a long rest . I have a drawer full of plays in my trunk that I 'm supposed to read . I have promised myself not to read any of them until I 'm headed back toward New York . . . when , will be a movable feast , depending upon what I feel like doing . I have n't had a vacation in ten years . Working in Hollywood is hardly that . " He was leaning far out on the little table . He now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent when covered by their onionskin . He bobbed his sleek head up and down several times and smiled like a tolerant man who knows the answers long in advance . He began to shake his fingered cigar at her even before opening his eyes and starting to speak . When he did look at her , she was a step or two away from the table , watching a tall young man approach her from among a party of people who had just entered the dining room . Mr. Bloch half-sprang from his chair , leaning over the table . The approaching man was not very likely to be a picture official ; but whoever he was , he was taking Michaelis away from him , and that could not be . Bloch left his chair and walked up to her just as the stranger reached for her hand and spoke to her . " Mike , darling ! " she said in answer to his exclamation . " Whatever caused this to happen ? " She was glad to see him . She wanted to be rescued from Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact of plucking at her sleeve . " Oh , Maggie , " said Michael . She had the impression that he had forgotten her automatically ; but that on seeing her again he was instantly pushed back to the feelings with which they had parted . " This is Mr. Morris Bloch , " she declared . " Mr. Breece . " " Haya , " said Mr. Bloch , with a per-sonality smile that lasted only a second . " Mr. Bloch , " said Mike , politely . " Look , " said Mr. Bloch , " we only got a little w'ile longa . So let 's sit down again and ? " " What are you doing here , Maggie ? " said Mike . She thought he implied the unspoken " with him , " meaning Bloch . She explained what she was doing , where she was going ; she was going to take the California Limited in an hour and a half . He said that was enough ; he took her arm and she felt his han shivering , and she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and she knew what she should do But she allowed Mike to gather he coat and gloves and made her bo charmingly to Mr. Bloch , who was un , able to believe what he saw throug his peeled eyes . She allowed Mike t take her out to the lobby . In he mind the thoughts were charging pas in a strange visitation . Just as sh had come free , now she was again i volved . So much to face again ! W chael stopped at the desk and asked fo a piece of notepaper . He explaine to her , as he wrote an excuse to th people he had come in with , that h was in Chicago winding up the Ham . ton deal . Two days ago he had fi ished it except for a few little details . " It 's the smartest thing I ever ma aged to pull off , " he murmured hal ingly , for at the same time he wa , writing out the message for the peopl he had left in the dining room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was blooming with satisfaction that was clear . They turned to g where she did n't know . At the curb waiting for a taxi to draw up , Mr Bloch stood in a hideous qualm o indecision between aloofness and frenzied impulse at one Iast trial . Th taxi solved it for him . He got in an went off . They took the next cab . 1 How the patterns of life repeat themselves ! thought Maggie . " Tell me about the Hampton thing , she said . In her voice were a ffectior and interest and that slight color o warning that attempts to establish for good and all what basis the meeting shall continue upon . " It 's too involved to go into in detail , " he said . This businesslike statement was spoken in a voice husky with anticipation . " I made sixty-five thousand dollars for myself as a commission on the deal . And Rod Hampton is perfectly satisfied with his end of it . ? Come here , darling . " " No . " He shoved over beside her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , no , " she kept thinking . Presently the taxi drew up to a small hotel a few blocks away from the Drake , and he looked at her . The hotel lobby shed a light from its red-velvet and walnut-paneled cavern . They could just see each iother in the cab . Their glances crossed . Maggie folded her hands on her lap and shook her head . Michael looked exactly as he had the first time he had come to importune her in her ew York flat . " This is where I 'm staying , " he said softly . " No ' Mike . " And now his earnest and pleading face recalled to her the valedictory threats of their last parting . The fact was then that he had n't killed himelf ; but she mentally laughed that idea away again , saying that was n't what she meant really ; but she had ; ent him away , to what he had earnestly implied would be despair and : ollapse . Whereupon he came to Chi-:ago , earned a huge commission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The humor of it now ouched her as she had n't been touched or weeks . She began to laugh , with . hat humming sound her audiences cnew and responded to so delightedly . The worst blow of all was that things went on . He survived . Perhaps he mitered , but only when he thought about it or when he saw her . " Tell him to drive on , Mike . I 've got to be near my station in a little while . " He was grinding his great hands together and his dark eyes were like the resentful eyes of a dog who is being punished . At last he leaned forward and tapped the driver 's window and ordered him to go ahead . " Mike , I have made a great discovery . " He sullenly turned away from her , as if to say that he hated conversation . But at once his gentler impulses won in him , and he turned back , smiling and tremblingly letting his fingers lie on her leg . He seemed humbly willing to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that after all I was the one who got involved in our winter , Michael . You remember how I swore to you that if you 'd be content with half a love you could come to me ? That was true , and it is still true , except that there are to be no repeats . But as usual , the woman got more mixed up and rooted down than the man . Even in this case , negatively . When I sent you off I expected a sense of finality . But it simply was n't there . And here we are , meeting again ; how could I have been so naive ? " He was looking at her with his head down , staring up under his black eyebrows . " You think I do n't feel anything then ? " he said , " At the moment , yes , you do . But when you have something else to do , off you go , and that 's all right . I really was afraid you 'd miss me . " But that made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play the coquette now . " I , after all , am the romantic one , " she said , " though I do n't suppose you could ever give me credit for it , Mike darling . Actresses are supposed to be so sophisticated . So hard . Ah , well ! " Her light tone , her analysis of their time together , struck him as evasions . " You need n't seek refuge in a lot of modern frankness and so on , Maggie , " he said . He sat back and folded his arms in dignity . " You do n't have to protect yourself by making fun of us . If . . . if you 're inclined to see it all as a foolish farce , why then I suppose I can have enough self-respect to . . . " " You are cured ! " she cried . " Tell me now about the Hampton slaughter . That 's really something . I 'm so glad , Mike . " He sulked for a little while longer ; but the Hampton deal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and before long he was telling her in his controlled enthusiasm how big a fool he had nearly been , how Hampton was much much smarter than he had thought , how time and again he himself fumbled out of difficulty by luck , how  --  in short , how shrewd and brilliant he had been , no matter how much he might adhere to sportsmanship in ascribing his success to sloppy strokes of luck , hard breaks for his opponent , etc . He was animated and content . She reflected what truth there was in her words of a little while ago . There was a truth he would never see . Many women would see it , she thought . Some of them would even use it in their calculations and devise ways to make themselves more important to a man than his work  --  a battle usually won not by a wife but a mistress . He put her on the California Limited after buying her flowers at an all-night stand near the station . Their farewell had a moment of upsurge in it , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to get off the train again and go back with him and let them be together and secret and happy for a few days more . But her memory was longer than that ; and kissing him with tenderness , she made him leave her compartment and watched for him on the platform outside , and when he appeared , waving his fingers like a small boy , she thought that he would certainly never grow up ; and now that it was all over , that made her rather glad for , she said to herself , as the train began to glide silently , his juvenility was a thing she could always think of as an excuse for her behavior toward him which suddenly seemed capriciously selfish and insensitive . She leaned to watch him , but he was quickly lost in the receding atmosphere of the station . And now there was the feeling of being alone and by her own choice . After all the events of the winter , there was only the resolution of solitude and a kind of peace to let her be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a particularly trying and expressive scene ; and she had the same feeling of vagueness now that always came the in the theater . But the story was finished off-stage , so ' to speak . Maggie had often thought that in any situation of three peopler4 one must always be victor . Her recent victory with all its aches and struggles somehow lost a little grandeur when a few weeks later she received a letter from Millicent . She read it , trying to quiet the resentment she felt . After all , it was a little obvious of Millicent% to parade her wifely triumph so con sciously .
