THE MAN WITH THE SCARRED HAND-Henry Kitchell Webster-Bobbs-Merrill ( $2 ) * <P> When Bank Clerk Jim Blake found his boss in conference with a man who had a long red scar on the back of his hand , he had the feeling that something queer was afoot . This goes to show that in a mystery story not even the hero should jump to conclusions . Still , you can hardly blame Jim ( who was not overly given to suspicion ) , for he never laid eyes again on the scarred man till they suddenly met in a dripping cavern , in the dark . Between those two meetings Jim had plenty to think about . <P> First he was fired , for no apparent reason except that he refused to sell his boss a small property he had just inherited , and because he had changed his vacation to go take a look at the land . Then he found somebody else , using his own name , had arrived before him . Then he saw Her . After that he was carried along on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a less sturdy hero , that should carry you with it willy-nilly . <P> Henry Kitchell Webster is one of the minority of U. S. mystery writers who tells a wild yarn so plainly and well you keep forgetting its improbabilities . Though Webster has written mystery stories without a single killing , if you take murders for insomnia The Man with the Scarred Hand should give you a night 's repose . <P> <P> * Published Jan. 30.
