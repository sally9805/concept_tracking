txt That movement of goods into public hands and into industrial inventory in November was at a rate considerably accelerated from previous months was indicated clearly by reports on consumption of cotton and rubber for that month made public yesterday . The figures for the period exceeded the like month of 1937 by wide margins and were well ahead of October . And there is reason to believe that , while one or two commodities have failed to show similar Improvement , due to special . situations , the gains recorded by cotton and rubber are broadly indicative of the consumption trend last month . Cotton consumption by domestic mills for November as announced by the Census Bureau was 596,289 bales , an increase of nearly 10% from October and of 23.4% from a year earlier . The bureau , attributing the increase to mill consumption induced by improved business , pointed out that mills had built up a supply and were now selling less than production . In this connection , it is interesting that activity in Worth Street , the textile center , after some weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an advancing price trend . Rubber consumption for November , as estimated by the Rubber Manufacturers ' Association , exceeded the most sanguine estimates , reaching a new high since June , 1937 . November consumption was placed at 46.048 long tons , against 40,333 in October and 34.025 in November 1937 . This compares with estimates ranging from 42.000 to 45,000 tons . There is little doubt that the revival in the automotive industry contributed to this better showing , as it probably did to a minor extent in the case of cotton . Copper Consumption Figures Other consumption figures for the month so far available include copper and silk . World consumption ' of the red metal was placed at 177,984 tons , a decline from the 199,968 tons the - month before , but far exceeding the 154,580-ton takings of November , 1937- It seems a reasonable assumption that the large consumption in October - was due in part to the international situation at that time . Domestic - consumption of copper in November was also below the month previous , 51,297 tons against 69,827 , but compared with only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in November totaled 41,599 bales against 35,631 in October and 31.749 in November , 1937 . Estimates place December takings at around 39,000 bales , the ? lower figure being attributable in part to holiday influences . Use of Rubber The sharp increase in rubber use reflects the greater demand for original equipment tires together with abnormally low inventories of casings hands of both manufacturers and distributors . Present indications are that automobile prodiktion for December will exceed that for November and that output for the first quarter of next year will approximate that for the current three months period . Since inventories of finished tires on October 31 were 8,518,867 casings , 26.8% less than a year ago , and considerably below what is considered normal , a continuation of the increased demand for automobiles would react favorably to new equipment business for tire companies . Expectation is that December consumption of rubber will be as good as if not somewhat better than the high level attained last month . despite the usual seasonal lull at this time of year . Tire Stocks Distributors ' tire stocks on October 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were also abnormally low . Total stocks amounted to 740,000 units , the lowest recorded in the past three years . To restock distributors , which is accomplished under spring dating plan largely during the first four or five months of each year , tire producers usually begin ' building inventories of finished tires starting in October or November . Imports of crude rubber into the United States in November decreased from the premonth which , with the sharp gain in consumption , brought stocks down to the loweat figure since November , 1937 , and marked the seventh consecutive monthly decline . Gross imports last month amounted to 31,064 long tons , a decrease of 10% under the October figure of 34.496 and 44.8% under the 56,302 long tons imported during November , 1937 . Rubber Inventories Total domestic stocks of crude rubber at November 30 amounted to 254,318 long tons as compared with 269,937 at the end of October and 222.707 on hand . November 30 , 1937 . High stocks figure recently was 301.436 long tons on April 30 , 1938 . In terms of supply and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of November were equal to 5.5 months ' requirements . This ip the lowest since October , 1937 , when stocks were equal to 5.2 months ' requirements . A six months ' supply is considered normal . With a strong statistical position evident in the rubber market , December delivery closed yesterday at 16.30 cents a pound , up 20 points on the day . Futures were 23 to 26 points higher on fairly active trade . Year-End Adjustments As only a little over two weeks remain in this year , it becomes increasingly evident each day that write-down on inventories and commitments of rubber by major tire companies will not be necessary this year . It is estimated that a price of 15 cents or better will preclude such adjustments at the year-end . This is exactly opposite the situation faced by tire companies at the end of 1937 , when rubber prices dropped from 27 cents in March to less than 15 cents in December , which necessitated heavy inventory losses for the yearWhile factors other than the domestic statistical position of rubber are currently attesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays a major role , and the improvement during November will undoubtedly be an important factor in maintaining price of this commodity at around present levels until the year-end . Rubber prices declined from around 17 cents a pound in September , last , to less than 16 cents in November , but this was believed to have been caused by the sharp break in sterling from 4.8524 to 4.63 . The recovery to the current level around 4.67 has had a steadying effect upon rubber , inasmuch as the United States is the world 's largest consumer and Great Britain is the major supplier . Crude Rubber Afloat Crude rubber afloat to United States ports as at November 30 is estimated at 51,114 long tons , which compares with 51.062 on October 31 , and with 81.302 long tons afloat on November 30. 1937 . Reclaimed rubber consumption last month was the highest for any month since September . 1937. amounting to 12,668 long tons , as compared with 11,803 in October and 9,703 in November . 1937 . Production of reclaimed totaled 13.995 long tons in November . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 19,823 long tons .
