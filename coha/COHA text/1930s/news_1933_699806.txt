txt WASHINGTON , May ** Ass sistant Secretary of State Raymond Moley spoke over the radio Satur ? day night with Presidential inspires tion , approval , or either , then an administration , famous for its informality , took a most informal means of announcing to the world . an ostensible revision of its world economic policy . There is the chance , of course , though it seems unlikely , that the President 's favorite economist and close ads viser was giving his own views ens tirely when he took off on s new course . Dr. Moley contended that " our domestic policy is of paramount importance " in leading the United States back to recovery ; that the chief service the London conferees can render is to " synchronize " national policies for business rehabili ? tation in each country , and that " wise international action can help distinctly and permanently , " but do no more , in helping to " build the basis of our prosperity here . " Taking the words literally , and . Contrasting them with some passages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on May 7 , they must be considered to proclaim a major policy change . On May 7 the President said ; Hand in hand with the domestic situation , which of course is our first concern , is the world situation , and I want to emphasize to you that the domestic situation is inevitably and deeply tied in with the conditions in all of the other nations of the world . In other words , we can get , in all probability , a fair measure of prosperity return in the United States , but it will not be perma- ' nent unless we get a return in prosperity all over the world . ? ? ? the International Conference that lies before us must succeed . The future of the world demands it . ? ? ? A New Strategy for London . It may be argued , though not without twisting the meanings of words , that when the President said on May 7 " the domestic sit . nation is our first concern , " he an . ticipated Dr. Moley 's radio address of May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cures for our difficulties he within ourselves , " and drove the same point home in several places . But it is not being so regarded here . The opinion is being advanced that Mr. Moley spoke by Presidential design largely for foreign consumption , that the administration 's viewpoint as to interdependence has not suddenly changed , but that the President has decided upon a ' new strategy for London . The purpose of the strategy , according to this reasoning , Is to dissipate the belief abroad that the London conference is to be an international Christmastree with the United States , in Santa Claus 's red flannel suit , providing all the gifts and distributing them with beaming rubicund face and quivering white whiskers . A secondary purpose , it . is held , is to modify the large hopes of London agreements raised in this country , by the optimistic and genial communiqu ? s from the White House after the visits of , Herriot , Jung and Schacht . Remember- ' ing the President 's skill as a politi. cal and diplomatic strategist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Held Possible . At any rate , the Moley speech deliberately played down London and played up Washington as the chief force against * depressed industrial conditions in the United States . It went further and implied that London can be a complete failure and the United States a complete success . This is contrary to previous impressions given by the President , Secretary of State Hull , the Demo ? cratic leaders and many ethers for more than two years . They have never agreed with Herbert Hoover 's thesis that the depression in . En . rope was chiefly responsible for the industrial debacle here . But they have often said that interne ? tional action was prerequisite to the return of normal conditions , and Wily recently has this been ex. plained as meaning merely the syn ? chronizing of domestic remedies in each nation . Mr. Hull , and pres sumably the Democratic Congressional leaders , have not altered their general position or offered this limited definition . If it be true that the restatement of the administration 's economic theory by Dr. Moley was made chiefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fall on what is done in London and can take care of itself if the alternative presented is to give much and receive little , then the effect of the strategy can best be judged by the outcome of the conference itself . But if the speech charts a fixed policy and amounts to a set of instructions for the American delegates So the World Economic and Monetary Conference , then it represents a definite cleavage in administration circles which may hamper Mr. Hull and his associates in what they seek to accomplish at London . The Secretary of State wants to reduce tariffs and eliminate trade and exchange restrictions by whichever of the several methods prove most available . These include horizontal reductions of duties , bilateral and regional treaties and the use of the most-favored-nation clause whenever it can be fitted in . His basic hope has been reciprocity . And Mr. Hull still holds that international economic action is essential to returned permanent prosperity in any land .                    @
