The American College of Surgeons , American College of Physicians , American Medical Association all bind their members not to split fees . Nevertheless , the practice of dichotomy-by which one physician refers a patient to another for a price-is almost as widespread in the U. S. as it is in France , where it has been regulated . So flagrant has the practice become in New York City , where medical competition is keen and many a physician has to scratch gravel to survive , that last week the president of the Association of Private Hospitals Inc. called in the press to expostulate . <P> Dr. Harold M. Hays , Episcopalian brother of the Jewish civil libertarian , Arthur Garfield Hays , operates two private hospitals in Manhattan . He also is an otolaryngologist of note and gets many cases referred to him from other physicians . " It is possible that as many as 60% to 70% of the 14,000 doctors in the metropolitan area are engaged in this pernicious practice of splitting fees . Best evidence we have of this is the vote taken last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of 770 doctors voted against establishing a law to stop the practice . " <P> As a savage example of fee-splitting , Dr. Hays recalled : " About a year ago a Bronx doctor called me . He said that he had a case of mastoiditis , a child , and would I operate . This was on a Saturday , and the doctor suggested that the operation be performed the following Monday . I asked what temperature the child had . He said , 103 . I told him that he must be crazy if he did n't think that the operation should be performed right away . ' Well , ' said he , ' we have to make an arrangement . ' The ' arrangement ' was that he wanted me to charge $1,000 for the operation and offer him a substantial portion . Over the week end he was going to persuade the child 's family that $1,000 was a fair price . " <P> As a healthy substitute for fee-splitting , thousands of U. S. doctors practice patient-splitting . A group which is friendly or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to each other when they need various specialist attentions . Dr. Hays last week recommended another solution , suggested that the practice of dichotomy be established aboveboard . It was his idea that specialists pay 15% of the patient 's fee to the diagnostician or general practitioner for recommending him . The general practitioner , under this system , is not to charge the patient any other fee .
