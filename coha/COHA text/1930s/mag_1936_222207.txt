Rottenest Exhibition <P> Sirs : <P> In your issue of April 6 , you expressed the desire to learn " what disabled veterans think of the Peaceways ' Sucker ' ad . " <P> I am one disabled veteran . I left one of my limbs on a French battlefield . <P> Next to Vassar 's " Future Gold Star Mothers , " I think the above mentioned ad the rottenest exhibition of very bad taste that I have known in my entire lifetime . There is nothing in the drool ( in smaller print ) under the cartoon that can lessen the sting of the picture and its caption . <P> E. S. HAYES <P> Worcester , Mass . <P> Low-Down Insult <P> Sirs : <P> . . . Regardless of how or why war came in 1917 it was the duty of every American to serve . I was over there . I left my right leg on the battlefield . <P> No regrets . I 'm still as good , if not a damn sight better , than a lot of men with both legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a low-down insult , a slap at all my buddies who went west , as well as those of us still carrying on . Would World Peaceways dare tell any Gold Star Mother her son was a sucker ? <P> I hope no more of those rotten headings are permitted by FORTUNE in any future advertisements . <P> <P> FRANK M. JACOB <P> 47th Co. , 5th Reg . Marines 2nd Division , A. E. F. New York City <P> " We Were Suckers " <P> Because of the nature of the following communication , TIME herewith breaks its rule against printing anonymous letters. - ED . <P> Sirs : <P> We can not sign our names to this , but it is no crank letter . You want to know what the disabled veterans think about the World Peace-ways " Hello , Sucker " matter . Here is what two of us think , and we know there are many more who would say the same thing . <P> World Peaceways was not laughing at old soldiers . That picture was trying to show what more people ought to see-some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hospital for shell-shocked veterans up here that 's not a very pretty place to visit . If the movies showed some of those cases instead of parades and medals and glory , people could see what really is war . We think if people in this country knew some of the terrible things that happened in the last war they would n't allow another one . We two volunteered . We were not drafted . We honestly believed that it was a just and right war . And now when we read the papers and see the rearming in Europe and right here that 's going on it makes us think that all the things we went through were for nothing . <P> No , we do not think that picture was in " poor taste . " We were suckers . We are not Reds , but we would not fight in the next war for oil concessions or loans or whatever it is , even if we could , and we give those college kids credit for saying they do n't want to fight . We were suckers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wo n't be suckers like we were . FORTUNE deserves all the credit in the world for publishing that picture . We think a man shows he loves his country if he wants peace , not if he wants war . <P> TWO VETERANS who are disabled but can still think . <P> Northampton , Mass . <P> Sirs :
