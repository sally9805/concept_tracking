PRESIDENT of the United States once discussed with me his relations with the press . " I can find an answer for any other problem , " said he ; " it may not be precisely the right answer , but it will probably work . I do not know how to deal with the press . That problem is insoluble , " The President . of the day  --  whoever he may be  --  probably soon learns to regard the journalistic mob which beleaguers him with feelings compounded of enmity and fear . In a happier day the President was able to select a few intimates through whom to address the country . The other members of the body of Washington correspondents found themselves twenty-four hours late on whatever piece of news the President wished to put out . That phase of Washington correspondence came to an end with the opening of the World War , if , indeed , the changing tempo had not put . a period to it at an earlier date . When a President nowadays talks to the press , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen to two hundred . The majority are , in effect , strangers to him . In any group , whether of correspondents or men in some other occupation , there are variations in ability , integrity and meanness . This fact must be borne in mind . All are there for the purpose of getting a story . Some are moved by personal or partisan considerations . If he does not give them a story , they go away grumbling . That grumbling may easily assume the proportions of a grievance . If he does give them a story , he may not . rely upon the discretion of the body , because the body has no discretion . It is not organized and is therefore beyond control . Each of its members knows that some one of the number may , under temptation , shuffle off his responsibility upon the news editor back home . If the President asks the cooperation of the correspondents , sonic of them may suspect him of trying to put something over . If he does not ask their cooperation , some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is disciplined , he becomes a martyr . If he does not break faith , his news editor may eloquently inquire if he is still asleep . A President soon learns that a correspondent who likes him personally and supports his policies may be regarded by some of his fellows as fatuous and suborned , and that a cor-respondent who doubts his every word and mo-tive thinks of himself as being as importantly patriotic as was Gen. Israel Putnam . There are so many correspondents that they can not be dealt with as individuals , and every attempt to deal with them as a body has been just a mess . No wonder the President quoted looked on the problem as insoluble . Not long ago France accused President Hoover of a Li under in diplomacy because his plan to grant Germany a year 's grace was published before he had consulted the nations in interest . Because of the wounded amour proprs of the French statesmen the plan almost fell through . They felt and said that Mr. Hoover had , in effect , presented a pistol at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan into operation greatly lessened the good results which had been hoped . for . Yet Mr. Hoover had not been at fault . He had hoped to have forty-eight hours in which to communicate by telephone with the European capitals , after the eighty leaders of Congress had assured him in conference of their support , and before a suggestion of the proposed moratorium appeared in the press . No more time could possibly be taken , because of the urgency of the situation . He was not given an hour , in fact . The correspondents learned , through the various leaky channels of Washington politics , the general ( Continued from Page 92 ) minister to state the general Brazilian economic case , he said : " We cannot. adopt other than an optimistic outlook . In Brazil , unemployment practically does not exist . Living is relatively cheap , the milreis having , by a rare phenomenon , retained and even increased its normal purchasing power . There is no misery . We have no floating debt . Budgets are balanced and the national administration parsimoniously carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to trust in our own fut tire . Brazil needs foreign capital for the development of its own resources . 1 n fact , all our problems can be summed up in labor and capital . Foreign capital will , therefore , always be welcomed and will enjoy all the guaranties it requires . It , is especially desirable that it seek employment in the opening of new means of communication and in the perfecting of those at present existing , in the electrification of railroads , in the development of sugar and tobacco production , iu the silkworm industry , which finds exceptionally favorable conditions in Brazil , in the utilization of our textile fibers , in the development of the cattle-raising industry , in iron and steel mills , in petroleum exploration , and in many other enterprises which it . is unnecessary to enumerate . " President Hoover 's European moratorium plan will have an indirect effect of the greatest importance on all South American countries . It would , however , be very desirable if . in accordance with the generous ideas of his program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those countries which have no social questions , and are faced solely with momentary difficulties . These would disappear with the bestowal of the credits which they deserve . " Breaking the Rubber Monopoly For the final phase let us have a swift look at Yankee operations , especially a recent development  --  the Ford rubber project , upon which more than ' $7,000,000 has already been expended . To understand it you must first get the rubber background , past and present . The Amazon Valley is the natural habitat of the wild rubber tree . The existence of rubber was first observed soon after the discovery of America . Early explorers noticed that certain Indian tribes of South America played with a ball composed of an elastic and resilient substance drawn out of a tree . Subsequently it was found to possess the power of erasing lead-pencil marks . I limee the name " India rubber . " The rubber tree , however , was not scientifically identified until well into the eighteenth th century . If those early garnerers of wild rubber had envisaged the motor era they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two factors contributed to the collapse of the industry in the Amazon area . One was the hardship ini-olved in obtaining the product . Explained in the simplest fashion , the rubber tree is tapped and gives forth a milky substance called latex , winch is put on a paddle and cooked over a wood fire . The sticky , brownish-black , pliable residue which collects on the paddle is rubber . This process involves immense toil , because the latex cups must be emptied every day . Each native in the Amazon region had to watch from 75 to 125 trees a day . Moreover , he was compelled to stand over the fire , which meant that he inhaled the smoke . Ruthless exploitation marked the high tide of the wild-rubber era in Brazil . The only other source of supply was the Belgian Congo . The price of the crude product shot up to nearly three dollars a pound . As a result , the name of the state of Para , heart of the rubber domain , became synonymous with that of the product . Manaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suddenly developed a population of 80,000 , and was as frenzied in wickedness and activity as any mining town in Alaska , Australia or South Africa after a big strike . As automobile production expanded , the Brazilian output , due to the primitive conditions under which it was harvested , could not keep pace with demand . Moreover , the seeds taken out of Brazil had brought ? forth slips which were now planted in the Dutch and British East Indies . The age of plantation rubber was on , contributing the second factor which spelled the doom of Brazil as a source of supply . Long before 1925 the production was negligible as compared with Malaya . We consume considerably more than half the crude rubber produced , at a cost , in normal times , of $300,000,000 . There are exactly 300 needs for rubber in automobile construction and operation . Such an essential commodity should have free market play in accordance with the law of supply and demand . The British , whose output . is the largest in the East Indies , thought otherwise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November , 1922 , they established a control of distribution through export quotas . The inevitable price pinch occurred . In 1925 rubber soared from twenty cents a pound to $1.21 , in a spectacular , runaway market which enriched planters and stockholders . We then discovered , to our cost , that rubber is not only highly elastic in quality but in manipulation as well . Tire consumers of the United States paid the freight for this diverting example of government interference . Any government control , however , whether in coffee , sugar or rubber , is a boomerang . It invariably leads to drastic economy and the opening up of new and competitive areas of production . The ill wind eventually blows good to the victim . So it was with the all-needful rubber . We began to salvage old tires and reclaim abandoned stocks . Within a few years the rubber market broke and the Stevenson Act had to he repealed . Cutting Travel Time in Half Beginning in 1926 , we talked a great deal about making ourselves independent of the British supply . Only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One was Harvey Firestone , who had laid out immense plantations in Liberia . The other was Henry Ford , who launched his Brazilian enterprise in 1927 with the organization of the Companhia Ford Industrial do Brasil . A concession of more than 3,000,000 acres was obtained in the valley of the Tapajos River , a tributary of the Amazon , at a point 600 miles inland front the port of Belem , known in the United States as Para . There is a water frontage of seventy-five miles on the Tapajos . Here has been launched the undertaking which may mean the economic rebirth of one of the richest productive areas in the Western Hemisphere . Another North American agency contributory to Brazilian social and economic advance is aviation . On October thirtieth last the final link of the east-coast air mail and passenger service from Miami to Buenos Aires was completed . The dream of encircling South America by Yankee aircraft became a reality . It is now possible to leave New York and make a plane journey down the Atlantic coast to the Argentine capital , cross the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning via Panama to the original point of departure in exactly seventeen days . By rail and boat , making close connections , the same trip would consume not less than forty-two days . To no other major South American country , with the possible exception of Peru , does aviation mean quite so much as to Brazil . In the north , the Amazon and its tributaries provide moans of communication . Because of the inadequacy of rail transport elsewhere , the aeroplane is a godsend . IN political significance has begun to be felt . Formerly the northern coast of Brazil was so remote from the federal capital at Rio that the central government had little control over the actions of local authorities . Today it is only necessary to telegraph an official at Belem and he can be in Rio by plane in two and a half days ' time . By boat it would require approximately two weeks . Yankee air interests did not enter Brazil until the summer of 1929 . The mail and passenger service has made for closer business relationship with us . Through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can keep in constant touch with his office in New York or elsewhere . The saving in time is evident when I say that between Rio and New York mail takes thirteen days by boat . By plane it is seven days . Unlike conditions on the west coast , the Pan-American Airways have strong competition on the Atlantic seaboard south of Panama . The two competing lines are the Condor Syndicate , which is German , and the Compagnie Generale Aeropostale , owned by government-subsidized French interests . The latter company links France with Brazil by way of Dakar , Africa . Small , fast boats are used to transport the mail from Dakar to Natal . It is intended to substitute seaplanes for them and make it an all-air service . The Brazilians have always entertained the friendliest feelings for us , and their mood is reciprocated . On July fourth , 1931 , a Friendship Monument , made possible by nickels and dimes contributed by North American school children , was dedicated on the harbor front at Rio . Provisional President Vargas accepted it on behalf of Brazil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rio in 1922 . Because of a difference of opinion as to site , it remained in cold storage for nine years . No other South American country approaches Brazil in potentialities for expansion . She possesses the largest of all areas available for the support of the human race and the creation of productive industry . Once purged of political unrest , the republic can become a commanding economic power in the New World . outlines of the plan and descended on him in a body . " Premature publication may defeat the plan we have in mind , " urged the President . " We want the story , " said the correspondents . " The people are entitled to know what is going on . We will print what we know , in any case . " The body of correspondents was , in fact , helpless to prevent the publication of the farts , even at the possible cost of a world collapse . They knew that they could not rely on a collective promise not to print . Even if all the correspondents present kept . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondent not present who would be free to print . There was also the extreme probability that a few visiting editors were present at the presidential conference . A field day of that sort brings visiting editors out like sand flies . A visiting editor is often weak under the temptation offered by a big story in Washington , where he maintains a highly paid correspondent . He feels that if he can scoop the correspondent on his own ground the correspondent will he less cocky thereafter , and seldom is a visiting editor quite clear on the restrictions implied by his admission to a press conference . Anyhow , someone would be sure to talk . Correspondents are not the grave , stern men their readers think them . They are as chatty as cockatoos . One paper could spill the beaus as effectively as all the papers . The correspondents did not agree to postpone the story of the moratorium , because they could not postpone it . They were as helpless as Mr. Hoover himself . No President has ever had a good press from the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his word is openly doubted and his motives habitually suspected . No pigeon ever had a good hunter . It is the habit of the Washington correspondents to wait , guns in hands , until the Administration can be popped out of the trap . On those days when the Administration obstinately refuses to pop , there being no international bicker or big-time politics in sight , the reporters are expected by their editors to produce lively yarns from Washington about the wife , dog , necktie , breakfast sausage or mongoose of the President . It is on the days when these human-interest stories are printed that the current President revises his opinion of the human race . It is , he sees , far lower than he had feared . If no President , ever had  --  from his point of view  --  a good press , some Presidents have had a worse press than others . These variations are governed  --  or so it seems to me  --  not so much by the merit of the man who happens to be the President as by the conditions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of 100 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 9 , 1932 ( Continued from Pose 96 ) peace and prosperity , mid was therefore enabled to wear a wide hat and a. pair of fur chaps for the photographers without . incurring general enmity . A atmly of t Ito photography of t he period leads to the conclusion that . the only person who hated Mr. Coolidge in fur chaps was Mr. Coolidge . Mr. Hoover began his term almost . synchronously with a world-wide disaster . If he were to pose in such garb , the roar of disapproval could he heard from Will Rogers to the Bering Sea . The major questions passed on by Mr. Coolidge had been so thoroughly debated that their terms were familiar to the reading public . Mr. Hoover fell heir to a new series . That . part of the press which is dissatisfied with Mr. Hoover personally . progressively or politically began to set springes , with the new problems as bait . That , is the luck of the presidency . Mr. Harding once groaned to his secretary : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take this job ? " The Presidents and the press were on fairly good terms as recently as the Taft Administration . Only fairly good terms , of course . The opposition always regarded the President as a menace , but until Taft was elected , the President at least had a borne life and a front door that could be locked . If he wished to ride through Rook Creek Park in the early morning , he was free to select a pair of admirals for companions if he wished . Nowadays an early morning ride through Rock Creek Park would resemble a cavalry maneuver . In those simpler days few reporters visited the White House and still fewer made regular calls . For the most part they picked up White House news on Capitol Hill . Nowadays they might he found under the rugs . They are as permanent items in the establishment as Rudolph Forster in the office or the secret-service men trying to look like visiting haberdashers . No man enters the White House without their knowledge or escapes after a talk with the President . until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withstand a rapid-fire questioning by men who are highspeed and merciless questioners , and many are the good plans that have been marred by revelations made on the White House lawn . Because the man they are watching is merely the President of the United States , they are free to write as impersonally as of the Sphinx at Gizeh . The usually equable Harding lost his temper because of one critic of his sartorial devices . " Keep that man out of the White House , " he ordered on one occasion . " That fellow that ca n't let my pants alone . He keeps writing that they are too long . " When Confidence Was Respected The reporter could not he kept out . An attempt to keep him out for such a cause would have made millions of readers shriek at the breakfast table . But there was a time when such a reporter would not have been permitted to get in . Correspondents in the elder days interpreted the news instead of peddling piddling gossip . Men like Samuel G. Blythe and Oscar Coolidge and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important events of the day . Sometimes the discussions took place at Shoomacher 's . If they received a confidence they respected it , even if they were scooped in consequence . Their editors expected the news of the day on polities rather than biology . The correspondent of a great Western daily learned that Mrs. Alice Longworth would be a mother . " Of course , I could not print it , " he explained to his editor , when a rival paper had used the story . " It came to me in confidence . " After journalistic methods had changed , the editor of the same paper was told that . a blessed event was hoped for in the Coolidge family . The story was untrue . The Washington correspondent was assured at the White House that it was utterly false . The editor made a double-column box of the denial and placed it on the first page . I t had a greater news value than a mere affirmation would have had . It was only by exercising whatever of authority over the press is still vested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the news associations consented to ignore an embarrassing fiction . The editor of the paper which printed the denial was grim in his explanation . We got scooped on the Longworth baby , " he said . " We were gentlemen then . " Roosevelt 's Trial Balloons The first signs of the cloning change were noted under President , Taft . The correspondents knew and liked him . The body of correspondents , too , were professionally pleased with the departure of Theodore Roosevelt . He made news  --  plenty of news  --  but he was fulminant and uncertain . News reception by the populace had not yet been tuned to high-speed frequencies and what was then known as a trial balloon was often launched by Roosevelt . If the trial balloon met with public approval , all went very well . If it did not , the reporter who had launched it might find himself denied . In these more cynical days a diplomatic denial is understood to mean that the denying diplomat only means that the stolen watch was not found in his pocket , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called it umbrage then . There are correspondents still alive who are as full of umbrage as they were the day that President Roosevelt denied them . lie was the first President , however , to develop a clear idea of press management . He knew that it is never possible to have satisfactory dealings with a large group of reporters , and so he selected a few as his news mediums . Those who were not . selected were displeased by this presidential favoritism , but there was nothing they could do about it . The presidential favorites got all the big stories . Roosevelt knew that a Monday-morning paper was apt to be empty , and so he floated his best stories on Sunday night . It was great to be one of the selected correspondents , up to the moment when one of the selected was thrown over the battlements . This history is adduced to explain why President Taft was welcomed by the correspondents . Yet it was during his presidency that the reportorial beleaguerment of the White House began . Big Bill Price was charged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on at the White House . Mr. Price was of a generous style of architecture and an exceedingly able man . He was the first reporter to make a daily visit to the White House . Having reached his goal , it was his custom to sit down and rest . Mr. Taft liked Price and appreciated the fact that a man of weight does not enjoy pedestrianism . He began to give Price bits of news to save him the long toil over Capitol Hill , where most of the White House news had been originating in senatorial offices , and presently provided him with a desk at which to write his stories . Other reporters soon demanded equal privileges . Now the White House reporters are sufficiently numerous to have an association which gives an annual dinner and elects officers , although it does not include all the men who , as regular correspondents , have the right to attend the periodic press conferences with the President . Mr. Taft was the first to suffer under the new system . On one occasion he was so angered by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcomed guests that he canceled every appointment for the day . " But you are giving an important dinner this evening , " his aides remonstrated . " Call it off ! " said the President . " I will not go . " It could not be called off , but the host appeared at it half an hour late . One after another his secretaries and more intimate friends had urged upon him the necessity of dressing for the dinner , and one after another they had beaten disordered retreats . It was not until Mrs. Taft exercised her wifely authority that , he consented to forgo his grievance . White House reporting had not , reached full efflorescence at that time and the reporters failed to report that a body of distinguished men had been kept waiting until the President had been able to button his collar without . burning it . The incident would be good first-page news nowadays . It would have been good first-page news then , in fact , but the reporters were afraid to tell the story . There was at that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might take . Even the ordinarily good-natured and obliging Taft , however , rarely granted audience to reporters , singly or in groups , on matters of public import . The established pattern of diplomacy was followed and the statements issued were mostly of a formal character . It remained for President Wilson to recognize the shift in the reading habits of the public and in journalistic methods , and to institute the press conferences which all correspondents in good standing might attend . Mr. Wilson was magnificently in earnest when he inaugurated " pitiless publicity . " It was his conviction that every citizen should know:all that his President is doing and that every correspondent would valiantly and with discretion support him in his effort to tell all . Enthusiasm and energy radiated from him the day he told the reportorial body what he planned to do . He was friendly , confident , and happy . The Era of Pitiless Publicity Mr. Wilson 's previous experience with journalists had been during his term as governor of New Jersey . He had had a program to put through and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between officeholders and the political chiefs who have aided them to office . His best weapon then was publicity of the most pitiless kind , and he did not realize that the problem and its factors had changed when he became President . For a brief time the correspondents reveled in news from the head of the state . Mr. Wilson had assumed that they would use discretion in their writing . They assumed that whatever he told them was to be printed , as had been the habit under the former plan . It seemed to Mr. Wilson that they bad no appreciation of their responsibilities . They cheerily asked questions which revealed or suggested friction with other countries . Many questions tended to create friction . Mr. Wilson began to look on his policy of publicity with distaste and upon the correspondents with a more positive feeling . " Too many Of them are half-baked boys , " he said . It is true that many were younger than had been the rule for Washington correspondents , but the explanation was in the fact that newspapers had stepped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were forever at an end . The relations of public men toward the correspondents in Washington had been something like the relations of public men in London toward the leader writers of the great dailies . The correspondents got the news , of course , but they were equally interested in the interpretation of the news . When the World War began , correspondents were perforce translated to the status of reporters . Many of the men reporting events in Washington had been sent on from their home offices because they could get the news . They neither knew nor eared about the traditions of what , with the cockiness of youth , they regarded as a somewhat somnolent. past , and they had been trained in the hard school of which the politician and the policeman are the pedagogues . Presently Mr. Wilson called the corps of correspondents together . " I am about to address you as Woodrow Wilson , " he said , " and not as the President . " Fatherly . Rdvice From the President He was literally pallid with fury . The newspapers had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the product of that change in journalism which was later to produce the tabloid . An item from the back stairs might he more interesting than an item from the grand stairs . If Miss Wilson appeared in public with one man , the fact was widely chronicled . If , the following day , she appeared with another man , the reporters fought to get to the telephones . President Wilson talked to that gathering of reporters as they had never been talked to before . Somewhere in the private files is the stenographic record . " This must stop . " he said . " On the next offense I shall do what any other indignant father would do . I will punch the man who prints it in the nose . " With the advent of the war , the system of handouts was initiated . So much news was originating daily in the departments that it was a physical impossibility for the Washington staff of any paper to cover them all , and the Government press agent came into being . It is a poor Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The handouts have had two results : The reporters are no longer obliged to maintain the intimate personal contacts which had produced news in the past , and have been freed from the restraint that had been imposed by the necessity of keeping on good terms with news sources . As all reporters suspect all press agents , they regard all handouts with sus-pinion . A Government press agent must put the Government 's best foot foremost , just as any other press agent must try to further the interests of his employer . Newspapers had increased in size and the public taste had changed . Readers were no longer content to glow with partisan fury as they read the eloquence of their favorite correspondent or to chuckle at his humor . They wanted news  --  spot news  --  on which striking headlines might be written . Mr. Wilson found himself confronted at every conference with hard-boiled reporters determined to tear each fact of the least significance from his custody . In the end he abandoned his effort to take the public into his full confidence and frankly sought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national interest . It is not a criticism of the correspondents , but merely a recognition of an altered journalistic condition to say that their attitude toward the President  --  whoever he may be  --  is now that of a police reporter toward the chief of the homicide squad . They want the story of the crime . " Be careful what you say to the press , " was the advice given Warren G. Harding . " That 's nonsense , " said the newly sworn President . " I am a newspaperman myself and I know all about reporters . They will not throw me down . " They did let him down  --  from the point of view of a President  --  because they could not do otherwise . Mr. Harding told the assembled correspondents at the National Press Club that he proposed to talk to them with candor because he knew he could do so safely . That would have been feasible if he had been dealing with them as individuals , but it was wholly impossible in dealing with them as a group . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . became a major indiscretion . He had assumed that they were friendly . Most of them were friendly to him , personally , but professionally they were cold as snakes . He talked without full knowledge of the facts about the islands in the Pacific on one occasion . " I do not regard the four-power Pacific pact . as covering the principal islands claimed by Japan , " said he . X New Technic for Reporters Perhaps one-half the reporters there knew that statement , put in print , would at once arouse the Japanese Government to fury . Instead of warning Mr. Harding , they printed the story . It was hardly on the streets before Secretary of State Hughes was in the White House to offer his resignation . He was persuaded . to withdraw it , and Harding at once changed his policy toward the correspondents . " All questions must be presented in writing , " he ordered . " None will be replied to until the department affected has been consulted . If no reply is made , there must be no reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the Arms Conference of 1021 , Mr. Hughes refused to deal with the press , and Lord Riddell acted as spokesman for both the American and the British delegations . This was bitterly resented by the American reporters and no convincing explanation has ever been made , but it may be presumed that Mr. Hughes took this step in order to minimize as far as possible narratives of conflict between the two great English-speaking nations . There is drama in a story of combat , and there is no drama whatever in a story of peaceful and friendly agreement . If there had been a spokesman for the United States , it is as certain as anything can humanly be that in a moment of unwise candor or irritation or forgetfulness he would let drop a word that could be translated into a war whoop . Lord Riddell was self-possessed and extremely  --  oh , extremely  --  astute . He made no mistakes and he did his own country 's cause no harm . Coolidge and the Reporters On one occasion Mr. Harding made a long , fast and somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his entourage that the story was printed in defiance of the President 's wishes . " I 'll not go any farther with these men , " the President stormed when he read the morning papers . " I 'll get on the train and go back to Washington . I 'll not let one of them on board . " " But , you can not do that , " said Secretary George B. Christian . " What do you think they would write if you did that ? " It would he wild exaggeration to say that Mr. Coolidge 's relations with the press were satisfactory to Al r . Coolidge . On more than one occasion he beat on the table , but lie always slopped heating before he hurt his hand . He has ordered his secretaries to get an offending reporter on the telephone and ask him why he did it , and tell him that he must not do it again , but there was a tacit understanding that this was not for the record . In the afternoon the secretary would regret . that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporter . " I will speak to him when be comes in , " the secretary would say . " Never mind it now , " was the almost invariable reply . " Just as well you didn't. get him . " If his press relations did not always satisfy him , however , it , is probable that Mr. Coolidge had less trouble with the press than any other President since McKinley 's time . He had been in politics all his life and he knew newspapermen better than they knew themselves . He knew what to tell them and what not to tell them , and how to tell them . It . had been Mr. Harding 's custom to walk into the conference with a thick sheaf of written questions in his hand and leaf them over in search of the queries he wished to answer . The reporters whose questions were ignored usually walked out of the conference red-faced and declamatory . Mr. Coolidge brought to the conference only those questions he proposed to answer , and , upon occasion , had no hesitation in admitting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent it over to the department to get some information . " There were times when he made no satisfactory reply to any query . On such occasions he not infrequently half turned his back on his eager audience and gazed out the window as-al delivered a short talk on the good of the order . When he turned back , a sub-twinkle might he detected in the calm Coolidge eye . It did not satisfy his interrogators , but they unwillingly shared his placid enjoyment , There was always the chance , too , that he would wise-crack in a dignified and Vermont , ish fashion , as when someone asked him to comment on Rupert Hughes ' Life of Washington . " I see that the Monument still stands , " said he . It is the habit of the clerical force of the White House to paste on yellow sheets such items of news or editorials as the pasting clerk thinks may interest the President . Under some Presidents this had been carried so far that daily graphs were prepared , which presumably showed the rise or fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such things . It . is to he doubted if he ever looked at the yellow sheets . The one paper that he insisted on seeing daily was the nosy-defunct New York World . " I must . see the World , " he would say . " If it . praises anything I have done , I know I am wrong . " He refrained from watching the press because he knew that no good would come of it . " When I first came to the White House , " he said , " I made up my mind that I could not please everyone . " A stage wait . " So I just made up my mind I would try to please myself . So far I 've been pretty well satisfied . " A President once said to me : " The reporters hope to find a fight in every situation . " Of course they do . The story of a fight is always a good story , because it has color and action . It is the reportorial instinct to sniff around for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good terrier to suspect a- mouse-in even the most immaculate kitchen . When Premier Laval of France visited Mr. Hoover of Washington , journalistic suspicions were justified . There had been and were then differences of opinion between the two countries on various important matters , and the reporters assumed that nl . Laval hoped to iron them out .. They could not believe what . they were frequently told  --  that the visit was merely that of one goad neighbor to another , and that M. Laval and Mr. Hoover hoped through friendly discussion to reach an understanding rather than a decision . A Fight That Failed At first it seemed that a friendly , comfortable , businesslike meeting would lack the desired element of drama . Senator Borah obliged for a moment by saying some things with which M. Laval did not agree , and M. Laval was kind enough to say that lie did not agree with Senator Borah . But neither man lost his temper , and when they met at dinner they gave evidence of an immediate joint , liking , even if they were handicapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the reporters found the suggest-ion of a fight for which they were looking . It was announced that M. Laval and Mr. Hoover were unable to get together on the communiqu ? to be issued to the public over their signatures . It is a eartt that the principals did not spend more than twenty minutes  --  if they spent . that much  --  in discussing its terms . They had talked over what Id . Laval had come to talk over and they had by mutual consent avoided certain features on whirl , they obviously could not , agree . The counnuniqun was simple in its terms , general in its wording and satisfyingly vague . When they had agreed as to what they wanted said , the job of saying it in two languages /Continued from Page 1011 was turned over to I he secretaries . Anyone who has ever tried to make an English statement over into French which shall mean precisely the same thing will understand the difficult nature of the secretaries ' task . Neither Mr. Hoover nor M. Laval heard anything more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours the first pages carried tales of a. nonexistent disagreement . In Washington it is felt that President Hoover has had an extremely hostile press during the greater part of his Administration . The explanation is in the fact that . Mr. Hoover has had a number of new and controversial questions to deal with , and in the allied fact that the reporters are  --  it being a necessity of their existence  --  forever looking for a story of combat . The attitude of the press toward a President always interests Washington , a city in which politics is the father and mother of conversation . Everyone in Washington knows at least one cabinet member , two senators , a batful of congressmen and correspondents to taste . The fact that a group of reporters declared a vendetta upon President Hoover , complete with red fire and feathers in the hair , may not have attracted much attention in the states . In the District of Columbia it of ten rates as Topic C , Topics A and B having been formalized for some time . The knife-throwing perhaps seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because during his service as Secretary of Commerce the correspondents were almost unanimously friendly . " Hoover is stealing your thunder , " an indignant friend once complained to President Harding . " That 's nonsense , " was Harding 's reply . " The more good things are said of President Harding 's Cabinet ? the better it is for President Harding . " A Good Plan That Would n't Work As Secretary of Commerce , Mr. Hoover was the best news source in Washington . His department was continually on the production line with facts showing that . American business was growing in grace and American commerce was increasing in prosperity . All reporters like to print stories of that kind , Apart from that , Mr. Hoover was on the inside of everything that was going on , and he passed on to the reporters what part of his daily news budget he thought should be printed . He was not then under the present necessity of dealing with them en masse , but he was always accessible to the individuals . And the Department of Commerce had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Labor to the Treasury , must consider daily whether its deeds are conforming to the Administration pattern . The Department . of Commerce need only go pegging along , finding newways to trade old lamps for new , and everyone will be satisfied .. When Mr. Hoover entered the White House , he determined to deal very frankly with the press . He had been able to speak in perfect confidence to the reporters as Secretary of Commerce . They had ably cooperated with him . He believed that he would find in the body of reporters the same disposition to hold up his hands . It seems apparent now that he did not realize that many of its members were hostile to him politically and that all of them , broadly speaking , viewed him as a potential source of news which might sometimes be satisfyingly sensational , and not at all as a Chief Magistrate to whom they owed loyalty . Mr. Hoover determined to drop the White House spokesman , who had become a vaudeville jest under President Coolidge . He announced to the press conference that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three categories : Those in which the President might he directly quoted . Those which might be ascribed to " high authority . " Those which were not to be quoted , but which would be given to the reporters as background , in order that their stories might he more illuminative and interesting . The only thing wrong with the plan was that it would not work . Perhaps it was too perfect a plan . Reporters are persons and not factories . The men who disliked Mr. Hoover personally , those others who spoke for the straitest sect of Progressives , and those who were opposed politically continued to shade their stories . He was at times quoted directly for statements that should have been charged to the . " high authority . " The background material became something of a joke , because it was too often linked directly to the President . The visiting editors wrote stories after attending a press conference that the regularly assigned reporters would never think of ' writing . The battle molif appeared more frequently in the stories from the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoover himself wrote the statement which was given to the press on his return . It seemed clear beyond the possibility of misunderstanding , and yet it was so misunderstood that the next day one thousand telegrams came to the President 's desk asking : " What do these stories mean about the Philippines ? What is it all about ? " When Censure is Censorship They had not meant anything , in fact , except that news editors demand action in their scenarios . Secretary of Commerce Lamont talked with some industrialists on a plan to restore railroad bonds to investment favor and a. few days later called upon President Hoover . When he emerged , the reporters caught him by the sleeve . " Did you have a talk with the President about your plan for saving railroad bonds ? " " No . " The story appeared that Mr. Lamont had talked with the President about saving railroad bonds . Bond saving was a romantic topic at that moment , with the market shelling like green peas and heads of investing institutions wearing brave , bright smiles when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have been the warp if not the woof for presidential hair shirts for a generation was so devoid of fact that Theodore Joslin , one of Mr. Hoover 's secretaries , asked the reporters to check their facts before writing any story of the White House . Mr. Joslin 's well-meant effort became an attempt to clap a censorship on the news . It was a lively story on a dull day . The points of view of the Presidents and the press must continue to diverge . As the President quoted at the beginning of this article truthfully said : " The problem is insoluble . "
