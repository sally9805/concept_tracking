Leaders there expect its speedy ratification without further change . The House action on the bill will follow , and it is believed that the bill , just as it was agreed upon today , will be sent to the White House for the President 's signature next week after his return from his cruise . Senator Harrison , in announcing the agreement , described the measure , which was designed to bring in $5,300,000,000 in revenue , as " the most forward step in years toward helping employment by private initiative through a fiscal policy of the Federal Government . " Through its generous and fair treatment , especially with respect to capital gains and liquidation , " he went on , " it should result in the releasing of billions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gives " Relief to Business " " The tax bill gives real relief to business and should under normal business conditions increase receipts to the government . I am very much satisfied with the final agreement . " More qualified was the - praise given the compromise bill by Senators Vandenberg and Capper , minority members of the Senate group in the conference . They characterized it as " a long step toward a restoration of tax sanity , despite the unfortunate and unprecedented Presidential letter to , the conference . " . The two Republicans , declared that the bill would not raise the expected revenue nor " remotely approach the balanced budget , which is vital to the national confidence prerequisite to national recovery . " Assail Profits Tax " Remnant " Concerning the undistributed profits tax provision they said : " FOr two years there will still be a small and indefensible remnant of the surplus profits tax idea , to Which we continue to decline to subscribe in any degree . But the remnant is so Small and so - well cushioned and so sure of final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue at the polls that we prefer to take the conference decision than to fall back on existing destructive law . " When the conference adjourned at 1:30 today its taxiexperts joined with legislative bill drafters to start at once on the task of rewriting and correcting the 370-page document , with its 900 sections . " Major Achievements " Listed In addition to the changes in the undistributed profits tax and the capital gains levy which were agreed upon last Friday , the conference listed as major achievements : The addition of the Senate proposal to exempt the securities of public utility holding companies forced into sale or transfer by the death sentence section of the Holding Company Act from ? the capital gains tax . The adoption of the . Senate amendment strengthening the prohibition of the accumulation of " unreasonable surpluses " by corporations as a means of avoiding income tax payments .

Senator Harrison stated ? that the conference had - alirnine.ted the Borah amendment providing for the taxation of the income from future issues of government securities . " The Senate group insisted on its inclusion , " he said , " but the House conferees would not agree on the theory that the whole question should be handled in one separate bill . This was the Treasury viewpoint also and the Senate conferees receded on the proposition . " Tax on ? Spirits Increased The conference , however , restored the House amendment , stricken out by the Senate , placing an additional excise tax of 25 cents a. gallon on distilled spirits . The present gallon tax is $2 . The Treasury had opposed this boost in the liquor taX , which its experts had estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulted by Congress had placed the revenue increase at $35,000,000 .

A study of the measure seems to show that on matters of direct concern to business , where there was a difference of opinion between the . House and Senate , the conferees inclined to the alternative that favored business . Even in the case of the ' retention of the undistributed profits tax , ' it is expected that corporate business will pay less under the conference proposals than under the Senate flat tax - proposal of an 18 per cent rate . The " spread " between 100 per cent retention- of profits and complete distribution as far as the tax is concerned is only 214 per cent , from 19 to 16% , while . the House provisions granting exemption from the undiafributed profits : tax to mutual investment- and insurance companies , trust companies , joint stock land banks and corporations in financial difficulties were also written into the bill .
