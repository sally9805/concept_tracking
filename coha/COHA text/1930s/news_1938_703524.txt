txt The drastic decline in railway earnings in the past year , affecting severely even the more prosperous Pocahontas lines . may lead the Interstate Commerce Commission to permit an extension , at least for another temporary period , of the bituminous coal rate increases due to expire at the end of this year . This was the consensus among cranapot-LeLion authorities here last night after the railroads , citing their desperate financial plight . earlier in the day had petitioned the Commission to allow indefinite continuance of the higher coal charges without requiring a revenue pooling arrangement in this connection . The coal rate increases , which vary from three cents per ton in freight rates of 75 cents and less , to 15 cents in rates over $2 per ton , yielded added revenue during the first five months of 1938 at the rate of over $18.500,000 per year for the roads as a whole . In originally granting the increases in October , 1937. the Commission stipulated that , unless a pooling plan was worked out whereunder th ? major share of the added income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be terminated at the end of 1938 . Consumers to Fight Proposal Despite the general feeling that the ICC will be favorably disposed toward the carriers ' request , a vigorous fight by consumer interests to terminate the charges at the end of 1938 appears in prospect . The Consumers ' Counsel of the National Bituminous Coal Commission , in a recent circular to consumers , said in regard to proposals by the rails that the charges be extended : " Consumers ' Counsel will oppose these creases just as vigorously as we opposed other two cases because we believe they unjust and unfair . They are not only injurious to the public generally but we actually believe they are so exorbitant that they injure the railroads also . " Consumers were called upon to supply facts to put before the ICC . " which will outtress our opposition no that this perenial campaign of the railroads to penalize bituminous coal consumers will end . " All Roads Oppose Fooling Stating that not only were the Pocahontas lines . in view of their depressed earnings , vigorously opposed to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to such an arrangement , the carriers yesterday asserted that " the Commission is without power , directly or indirectly , without the consent of all of the carriers involved , to require them , or any of them , by the imposition of conditions or otherwise , to enter into any kind of a pooling arrangement or agreement " The adjustment of divisions , the railroads stated , is a " complex and difficult undertaking " They added that for many reasons it would be a " remedy of limited efficacy " and one which should not be undertaken without the most thorough study . After citing the fact that their rate of return during the first five months of this year was the lowest in any year since 1900 , the railroads asserted that the Commission " is bound , in the exercise of its full duty , to take judicial notice of material changes for the worse that have taken place in the financial condition of petitioners since this case was submitted . " The Splawn Committee report to the President last April was cited to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " altogether unsatisfactory . " Position Grown V% onus " Petitioners assert , " the railroads stated , " that the highly critical condition existing at the time of the filing of the petition in ex parte 123 has become even more serious . Since that time the financial situation of the railroads has grown progressively worse and the petitioners need for increased revenues has become much more imperative " Pointing out that for the first Ave months of this year the class one carriers had a net railway operating income of only $45,288,499 as compared with $240,111,982 for the same period in 1937 , the carriers said : " The continuance beyond December 31 , 193S of the increases on bituminous coal authorized herein therefore assumes an even greater importance to those lines than ever before and , petitioners believe . is absolutely necessary in order to enable them to continue to render adequate and efficient railway transportation service . " Due to the continuance of the business recession , it was asserted , the revenues of the I Pocahontas lines from bituminous coal have fallen off to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the financial results ! ' of operation of these lines for the first five i months of 1938 are actually and relatively ! worse than for any comparable period in the last 15 years . " It was estimated the Pocahontas lines diiring the five months period derived $1,836,942 from the increases . Citing also the low net operating income of southern and western roads , the petition stated : " The vital importance to the southern and western roads of these increases in their rates on bituminous coal is obvious . The injustice of depriving those carriers of said increases merely because of circumstances that relate entirely to the Pocahontas lines is also obvious when it is considered that most of the western and many of the southern roads do not participate at all , or only to a negligible extent , in the bituminous coal traffic which originates on the Pocahontas lines . " The foregoing statement was issued by the Association of American Railroads . The eastern railroads during the first five months of 1938 derived an estimated $3,702,291 from the coal rate increases , or over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated . This estimate excludes the Pocahontas region . The revenues derived by the railroads in the southern district during the first five months of this year were estimated at $1,009,204 , while the western territories ' revenues were placed at $1,159,115 during the same period . The carriers most vitally concerned with the coal traffic voted at P recent meeting here to ' not attempt a pooling arrangement as had been stipulated by the Commission .
