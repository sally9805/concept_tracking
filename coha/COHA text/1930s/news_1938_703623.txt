txt The business upturn , which has taken place since the Treasury began its tax studies last spring , will be given due weight in the final drafting of tax plans to be presented to Congress after it reconvenes in January , Secretary Morgenthau said yesterday . While the Secretary did not give specific examples how further improvement may modify the Treasury 's plans , it is indicated that the requirements of the budget will be of primary significance in working out the Administration 's tax recommendations to Congress . Increasing collections from present levies as a result of business improvement may lessen the need for new levies or increases in rates of existing levies the Treasury may seek . However , the Administration 's apparent determination to seek enactment of taxes on incomes derived from future issues of tax exempt securities would not be altered because of increasing revenues from other levies . It was recalled that the Administration 's avowed reason for seeking these taxes is elimination of tax exemption , which it terms unfair , and equalization of the tax burden .

Not Linked to Trade Pact Furthermore , Mr. Morgenthau said , the foreign exchange question is not linked to the prospective trade treaty between this country and Great Britain . The treaty would contain the usual " escape " clause the Secretary said , but no monetary arrangements beyond this are under consideration . Secretary Morgenthau said he has not taken part in any conversations among government officials on the question of a 10% tax increase to cover rearmament costs . " There may be other Treasury officials who have done so " , the Secretary stated , " but I do not know of their having taken part in any conversations " .
