txt Tony Brown , the switchboard operator at the Oak Park pollee station , gets a lot of calls which he thinks are pretty foolish , but last evening he got a call that seemed to set a new record . " I 'm at 722 Woodbine avenue , " said the voice over the telephone . " There is a woodpecker inside the house at that address and the family is away on vacation . Before they get back that bird might cut up all the furniture . I 'm going to break into the house and chase him out . You might send a squad out to watch me so as to see that I do n't steal anything . " The caller banged his receiver and Mr. Brown went into consultation with his colleagues . A squad car sped to 722 Woodbine . Sure enough , , there was a man about to climb a ladder leading to a second story window . He identified ' himself as Frank W. Bible dr , ; ' 307 South Oak Park avenue , and said he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woodbine avenue , When he saw a woodpecker pecking valiantly against a window pane . Mr. Bible climbed in the window , closely followed by policemen . The party went to the first floor of the house , and there was the woodpecker , just as described , pecking on windows and beating his wings . Mr. Bible and the policemen opened a lot of windows and shooed the frantic bird into the great outdoors . The police squad went back to the station to tell the switchboard operator that Mr. Bible was n't so foolish . Mr. Bible went back to the house next door to finish his visit .
