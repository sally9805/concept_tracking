SCENE .  --  A corner of the study of the EMPEROR FRANZ JOSEPH in the Hofburg , Vienna . It is late at night in January , 1889 , but THE EMPEROR is still at work , standing before a high desk covered with letters and papers . Tapers burn over the desk . There is no other light . Behind THE EMPEROR are a table and a chair , the table also covered with papers . CAPTAIN KOINOFF stands near the table . FRANZ JOSEPH Proceed , proceed , man . I can hear you while I work . KOINOFF Yes , Your Majesty . FRANZ JOSEPH Or shall I tell you what you were about to say ? He slits an envelopeA well-known oratorical bastard named the Archduke John of Tuscany  --  so far right ?  --  KOINOFF Yes , Majesty . FRANZ JOSEPH Will confer tonight with the Archduke Rudolph . In his company will be  --  let me think  --  a well-known radical editor named Sceps , a soft-brained family man with a profound conviction that the whole world can be set right by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I surmise , the imperial navy , the city reservoir and his own gravy boat . The presence will also be graced by an obscure young expert in military affairs , Koinoff by name , yourself in fact , and the meeting will take place at  --  shall we say the residence of the Archduke John ? p. 3 KOINOFF No , Majesty  --  the apartments of the Crown Prince Rudolph . FRANZ JOSEPH Dear me , in the Hofburg itself . There is a knock at the door and a SERVANT parts the curtainYou know , of course , that I am not disturbed here at this hour . THE SERVANT Yes , Your Majesty . FRANZ JOSEPH There is someone dead  --  or dying ? THE SERVANT No , Your Majesty . FRANZ JOSEPH There has been a calamity in the kingdom of which I must be apprised instantly ? THE SERVANT No , Your Majesty . FRANZ JOSEPH Then henceforth remember your orders . THE SERVANT Your Majesty , the Empress wishes to speak with you . FRANZ JOSEPH The Empress . Where is the Empress ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A pause FRANZ JOSEPH I will see her at once . The SERVANT goesGo out through my room . I understand then that the three of you will take up the question of modern government ? p. 4 KOINOFF That 's the whole story , Your Majesty . FRANZ JOSEPH This way . He ushers KOINOFF out . The SERVANT ushers in THE EMPRESS and withdrawsI 'm more than honored . You see before you a workman at his labors , a bit dusty , I fear , and worn . ELIZABETH You 've always worked while others slept , dear Franz . FRANZ JOSEPH You wish to sit ? I 'll stand , myself . It 's all my exercise  --  stooping for papers . He stoops to retrieve a fallen letter ELIZABETH Thank you . She sitsI 'm afraid I 'm quite inopportune . FRANZ JOSEPH It 's thirteen years as I remember it . since you 've come through this doorway . At that time you said , if I recall correctly , you would not see me again , you would not see me any more alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered . But I should be very busy indeed , dear Cissie , If I 'd no time to give you . ELIZABETH Let the question go . And the quarrel . It 's too late to rescue now what the flood carried with it to the sea so many years ago . All our deaths and loves go down the wash  --  No it was something else I wanted to save now  --  I 've passed your door some thousand nights , and listened , and gone by  --  it was never the moment . p. 5 FRANZ JOSEPH Something I could grant you  --  something to ask ? Among all petitioners you would stand first . ELIZABETH Still ? FRANZ JOSEPH Yes . You no longer love me . I know , but I love you still , and will , no doubt , while the pump goes . This has been our misfortune , yours more than mine . ELIZABETH I 've been too fortunate in many things . Or was when I was young . As we grow older and need our luck it fails . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the non-existent gods , are angry with us , having spoiled us earlier . FRANZ JOSEPH Non-existent ? ELIZABETH There  --  let 's not quarrel about it  --  let 's believe what we relieve . When you took me and made me Empress , long ago , that was luck , unbelievable luck for a younger daughter of the Wittelsbachs , a footless , scandalous tribe , with nothing to offer but my footless , scandalous ways , and a little beauty that faded under the lamps . FRANZ JOSEPH It 's not faded , Cissie , and I think it never will . ELIZABETH Well , beauty or not , you found me out for the ne'er-do-well I was , and I found you more emperor than mine , and things have happened that wo n't be forgiven on either side , no matter how you love or how thick the years mulch over . p. 6 FRANZ JOSEPH Yes . It 's true  --  This was what you wished to say ? ELIZABETH No . Oh , I 'm clear in my mind , Franz , though I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know how strict you guard your time , and would n't waste it . Here 's my business , stated plainly , quite without grief or a woman 's art . We have two things left to us out of the wreck of years and youth : the empire , and Rudolph , our son , who will rule it by and by , if all goes well . I think we shall lose them both if things go as they are . FRANZ JOSEPH Yes ? ELIZABETH I gave you an heir  --  my one gift to the kingdom , but a noble one ; such a prince as an emperor , dreaming of sons , could wish no happier issue . Magnanimous , wise , beyond his years , gentle but manly , eager to serve , a lover of justice . This was true ? FRANZ JOSEPH Yes . ELIZABETH But now he 's thirty years old , and this last two years the furies begin to tear at him . Perhaps my ways and yours at war in his blood . Perhaps inaction , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been brought to a delicate perfection . A peasant brain resists and keeps right on . It 's an evil court , but it does n't touch you  --  nor me . FRANZ JOSEPH Come then  --  our Rudolph ? p. 7 ELIZABETH I 'm troubled over the news from Hungary . It 's a freedom-loving people , never ours except by conquest . There 's but one way to keep them  --  that 's to extend the suffrage , rule them gentler than they can rule themselves  --  give without asking more than they think to ask . FRANZ JOSEPH This is like old times . ELIZABETH It 's as true now as then . FRANZ JOSEPH Proceed . I 'll listen . ELIZABETH Partly because he 's my son , and they believe I 've been their friend , partly because he speaks for all their hopes , the Hungarians have loved Rudolph , and he could hold them in the empire for you . You were emperor at eighteen . It 's a discipline that Rudolph needs ; power in his hands ; we grow by what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long while now . Divide your empire . Set our Rudolph over Hungary . FRANZ JOSEPH As king ? FRANZ JOSEPH I 'm growing old then ? ELIZABETH No , but he 'll have it in the end . You 'll live for many years , I hope . Is he to come to full dominion in a late middle age when he 's been burned out hollow with idleness and lusts  --  all his fine faith soured to mockeries with waiting  --  ? p. 8 FRANZ JOSEPH Have you spoken with Rudolph ? ELIZABETH No . FRANZ JOSEPH You 've never told me a lie , and I believe you  --  else I should think you must have spoken with him . When have you seen our son ? ELIZABETH Why , yesterday . FRANZ JOSEPH To talk with him ? As a mother might with a son ? I think not within the year . ELIZABETH It may be  --  longer . FRANZ JOSEPH Then let me enlighten you concerning Rudolph . I have a message here from His Holiness t enlightened me this morning . Our son 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage , free to marry again . I have no doubt he has in mind the same Vetsera harlot who shares his bed at present . Even you should grant this would make a kingly stench for the new-born court of a new-born kingdom in Europe . ELIZABETH Yes . FRANZ JOSEPH That 's first . Second , the state of Hungary 's aflame , of late , and I think our Rudolph set the fire  --  with plots to make him king , blow me aside like the old dodderer over desks I am , oh , leave me Austria if I care to keep it , but Hungary for Rudolph , Rudolph for Hungary , caps in the air , the old men in their places  --  somewhat to the rear , or slightly underground they 're in the way  --  a young man on the throne , let the bugles blow ! You knew of this ? p. 9 ELIZABETH No . FRANZ JOSEPH Well , I 've known  --  perhaps as much as any , and more than they know I know . If you 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ELIZABETH Rudolph began this ? FRANZ JOSEPH I do n't know . I ca n't swear it . It seems likely , judging by what he 's written , by the friends he hugs and the rendezvous he keeps . But to be just I do n't know how far it 's his . ELIZABETH If it were so that Hungary does wish it  --  wish him for king  --  you would oppose it still ? FRANZ JOSEPH A state will wish what it 's told to wish . It has no will of its own . ELIZABETH But what I 've asked  --  could so easily be done  --  without loss , even with gain to you . When we were young together you lightened your hand one day over Hungary for my sake  --  and in time , for I think it won them  --  FRANZ JOSEPH I should oppose it still . Not that it 's treason to me  --  all these things are words  --  faith , treason , honor  --  behind them lie realities of government which I face daily here on my desk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw you you were not seventeen , and beautiful in some sad crystal fashion that 's quite beyond the phrasing of an old man who 's made himself book-keeper to an empire and sloughed the graces . If I told you then I came too short in the telling  --  by some worlds I came too short . I loved you instantly , beyond recking costs , must have you ; we were married , the year went by like summer lightning , then I looked behind the laughter on your face and found an anarch , a laughing devil , stronger than I was , quicker of wit , a child in purpose , a demon in desire . You never once put out your hand but to tear down the kingdom , riddle authority , and with that seraph 's face and seraph 's tongue seduced me to betrayals that bind me yet . And still I loved you , still I could not tear you out , and Rudolph came , his mother 's child , an archangel 's face and tongue again , with a devil 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning . But I loved him  --  as I loved you  --  almost as I loved you . He hates me and betrays me  --  and I love him . All my life long I tread my own heart down here in the dust and silence of this room where no one enters . I shall defend my kingdom and hold it , and send it on despite you , yes , despite my love for you and him . Go now . I have work to do . p. 10 ELIZABETH I shall not ask again . FRANZ JOSEPH I have been patient with Rudolph , and shall be patient . He may be a son to me yet  --  but as for you when you loved elsewhere , when you took your body , the body of the Empress , and laid it down beside another man , and took him to you  --  when I heard this I heard my own death walking the palace hallways , stepping off my days and no other step to wait for . ELIZABETH You were the first in that , remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a woman , and not an empress . ELIZABETH No ? Well , that has been changed , I think . FRANZ JOSEPH It has not been changed . ELIZABETH You 've chewed on your revenge these many years . Surely it 's been enough , Franz . Where is Imry ? FRANZ JOSEPH Where you 'll not see him , where you would hardly care to see him now , no place for lovers . She steps back ELIZABETH Good night . FRANZ JOSEPH Good night . ELIZABETH This step you hear in the halls , it may not be your death but only a girl you loved one time . grown old and sleepless , hurrying now a little toward a too-long corridor 's end . You 're of tougher grain than I  --  or Rudolph . You 'll outlive us ; when you bury us the halls will be quieter . She goes out through the curtain . FRANZ JOSEPH takes up the paper weight on his desk , as if to resume his work , puts it down and sits , his eyes on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FRANZ JOSEPH Yes ? Yes , Taafe , TAAFE You asked me to come in without announcement when it was certain the Vetsera girl had come alone to Rudolph . FRANZ JOSEPH She 's with him ? TAAFE Yes . FRANZ JOSEPH We must be sure . TAAFE There 's a serving maid who watches about Prince Rudolph 's door . I 'll wager on it ; so far she 's made no errors . FRANZ JOSEPH Then we 'll go . He takes a step , then puts out his hand to the tableOne moment . TAAFE Your Majesty 's not well ? FRANZ JOSEPH It 's nothing . He sitsNothing , I shall wish you to come with me . They 'll be alone together ? TAAFE For a time . However , I have also information the Archduke John may visit him tonight , and it seems reliable . FRANZ JOSEPH The Archduke John . TAAFE That 's the Hungarian business . I should have thought the woman was enough , but when we 're young we take it in our stride , amours and intrigue after midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm rings . Still , we may find it awkward . p. 12 FRANZ JOSEPH Say nothing of Hungary . One thing at a time , and the woman first . TAAFE Very well . FRANZ JOSEPH What do you think of Rudolph , Taafe , frankly , forgetting I 'm his father ? TAAFE Frankly , sire , he 's a rebel and a rake . FRANZ JOSEPH I 'd give these arms here at the shoulder , I 'd step down in a grave tonight , let them stop my mouth and ears with earth to have another son . It may be I wo n't live forever . God send me the wit I need to save my empire from the son I have . I 'm better . We can go . They go out CURTAIN p. 13 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO SCENE .  --  A room , half living-room and half study , in the apartments of the CROWN PRINCE RUDOLPH of Austria , at the Hofburg . A door to the right leads to a reception-chamber , a door at the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the right rear a desk stands under a shelf of books , a skull grinning among the writing materials . At the left rear a fire burns in the fireplace . In the left wall are high French windows . Over the desk hangs a portrait of RUDOLPH 'S mother , the EMPRESS ELIZABETH , as a young girl , her hair crowned with stars . It is after midnight , the room ablaze with light . THREE MEN and THREE WOMEN , dressed for a masked ball , lounge and stand about the room , as if waiting . Among them are the BARON and BARONIN VON NEUSTADT . A domino lies across the couch , ready to be donned . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT Your question , then , sir . Your question . I am ready for your question . She seats herself before one of the men BARON VON NEUSTADT My dear , where were you yesterday afternoon ? BARONIN VON NEUSTADT At home , my love . Proceed . BARON VON NEUSTADT Be more specific . Where , definitely where ? p. 14 BARONIN VON NEUSTADT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VON NEUSTADT Ah , and your occupation ? BARONIN VON NEUSTADT I was burning  --  old letters . 1ST LADY Yes , that 's true , she told me . She was burning old letters . 1ST MAN All afternoon ? BARONIN VON NEUSTADT My dear Fritzi , all afternoon . 1ST MAN A bale of letters . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT Oh , quite a bale . At least . BARON VON NEUSTADT Ah  --  ah !  --  Then how did it happen , my only love  --  I call you to witness , d'Orsay  --  how did it happen that Mimi waited for you all afternoon in your bedroom , and saw nothing of you  --  no wraith of you , no glimpse , from two till six  --  1ST MAN What , saw no flame , smelled no smoke , no burning ? BARON VON NEUSTADT There was nobody there  --  ! BARONIN VON NEUSTADT The slut lies . 2ND LADY Oh , no , darling . I tell the truth . BARON VON NEUSTADT Rudi  --  Rudi ! p. 15 BARONIN VON NEUSTADT He 's about to complain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall buy a whip ! Rudi ! Rudi ! LOSCHEK entering from the bedroom.The prince will be with you in a moment , sir . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT And now will you answer my questions , sweetest of the sweet ? BARON VON NEUSTADT No . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT Come , I give you the witness chair . And to begin , where were you , my lord and master , yesterday afternoon ? 2ND MAN In church . He told me. 3RD MAN In medias res . RUDOLPH enters in a dressing gown RUDOLPH Why the outcry ? BARON VON NEUSTADT Rudi ! She refuses to tell me where she was ! RUDOLPH She ? Who , dear baron ? BARON VON NEUSTADT That one there ! My wife there ! RUDOLPH Must you take up our time with these domestic details ? BARON VON NEUSTADT But it 's incessant ! No matter where I expect her to be she 's always somewhere else ! p. 16 RUDOLPH But how fortunate you are in your family arrangements , and how some men would envy you ! BARON VON NEUSTADT You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exaggerate ! BARON VON NEUSTADT Not at all . 2ND MAN You are coming with us , Your Highness ? RUDOLPH I meant to , but some servant of the state has left a pile of documents on my desk  --  you see ? 1ST MAN They must be signed ? RUDOLPH They must be signed  --  to-night . 1ST LADY And you must read them ? RUDOLPH I must read them . 1ST LADY Shall we do him the honor of believing him ? 1ST MAN looking up at the portrait of THE EMPRESS . I swear there 's never in the history of the world been a woman as beautiful as the Empress . 2ND LADY Is n't it true ? And she 's still beautiful . 2ND MAN God knows where Rudi got his looks . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT There was a certain master of horse much favored of the Empress about our Rudolph 's time . An oaf , but ingratiating . Methinks a resemblance has been traced  --  p. 17 RUDOLPH Trail your slime where else you will , you rout of bitchery , but keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause 1ST LADY Come , come , darling , you attack the succession . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT Yes ,  --  I 'm sorry . After all , a prince 's mother is sacred . Will you forgive my offending ? RUDOLPH Some other time , shall we say ? To-night I find you not so much offending as offensive . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT You will make enemies . RUDOLPH I have made them  --  many and terrible . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT Do you wish to add me to the list ? RUDOLPH There was once a grandam , you may remember , who added water to the sea ? BARONIN VON NEUSTADT I do remember . RUDOLPH Ponder it . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT I would much rather be friends with you , Your Highness . And you 'll need friends . You are playing a deep and devious game in the Hungarian elections . You are involved far beyond safety with the Baroness Vetsera . You have offended your father on both these counts , and there is a limit to the tolerance even of an emperor . p. 18 BARON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not because you are dangerous , but for your honesty , I will be friends with you , my dear Baronin , and I will admit that the court of Vienna is a high and slippery place , whence a breath , a reaching out , may send one down the escarpments to oblivion . But for myself I have leaped . I have slid , I have positively dived over the parapets , only to find myself replaced with miraculous celerity upon the topmost point of this distasteful pinnacle . I loathe the court of Vienna , I despise the people who inhabit it , I despise myself for making a part of it , yet here I am and have been , any time this thirty years . What you say of my relations to Hungary and to the Baroness Vetsera , these are lies , rumor , scandal , what you like , but repeat them infinitely , I beg of you  --  give me what push you can from this glassy eminence , and you will be a friend indeed . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT But you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital crime in your circle ? BARONIN VON NEUSTADT It always makes me a little uncomfortable . RUDOLPH Oh ! that 's beyond pardon ! BARONIN VON NEUSTADT But do you actually despise the court of Vienna ? p. 19 RUDOLPH And loathe it . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT Then I 'm saved from boredom for another fortnight . I too shall despise the court of Vienna . I shall wither it with scorn , I shall drench it with adjectives . Children , we shall make this the latest thing . The Habsburg court ! Its incredible morals ! Its perfervid asininities ! Despise it ? I loathe it ! It 's  --  putrid !  --  Rudi ! Rudi ! We shall make you the height of fashion ! RUDOLPH Be off with you , all of you . You 're late , and so am I. BARONIN VON NEUSTADT Nevertheless I 'm more your friend than you guess . I have had the confidence of a certain person , but hush , we say nothing . 2ND LADY Are we going ? 1ST MAN Come , you rout of bitchery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEUSTADT But we 'll see you , Highness ? RUDOLPH In half an hour . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT Come , refuse ! Excrescences of a tawdry royalty ! Come ! BARON VON NEUSTADT Your word , Rudi ! They go out , leaving RUDOLPH alone . He waits for a moment , then calls p. 20 RUDOLPH Loschek . LOSCHEK entering . Your Highness ? RUDOLPH Look in the little passage , and bring Bratfisch to me . LOSCHEK bows and returns through the inner rooms . RUDOLPH sits at his desk , lifts a paper from the pile and leafs through it , then thrusts it back . LOSCHEK returns with BRATFISCH , and stands waiting BRATFISCH There was something , sir ? RUDOLPH Yes . He draws his hand over his eyes wearilyLoschek  --  there are too many lights . LOSCHEK bows and begins to extinguish the candelabra , leaving two candles that burn under the portrait of THE EMPRESSWhat 's the weather to-night ? BRATFISCH A light snow , Your Highness . It may fall an inch or two . RUDOLPH You 're to wait at the postern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take your place . You understand ? BRATFISCH No , sir . RUDOLPH He will take your place because you will assume this domino  --  this  --  the arms here  --  the eyes here  --  p. 21 BRATFISCH Yes , sir  --  RUDOLPH And will be driven to the Baltazzi palace , where you will be announced as the Crown Prince Rudolph . BRATFISCH Very well , sir . RUDOLPH Comport yourself accordingly , with grace , with dignity , above all with fitting reserve . Remain not more than a quarter of an hour . I should not suggest any passages with the ladies  --  beyond a discreet compliment here and there . BRATFISCH Yes , sir . RUDOLPH Go now and take the domino with you . BRATFISCH If you 'll pardon me , Highness , there 's a little man at the area-gate offering to sell chestnuts . RUDOLPH Did you make a purchase ? BRATFISCH I 'm his only customer so far . RUDOLPH An agent ? BRATFISCH He 's been posted there by somebody  --  to see who goes out and in . RUDOLPH Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a night of it , Bratfisch . A little of everything disreputable , and back here at dawn or thereabout . BRATFISCH Yes , Highness . BRATFISCH bows , takes up the domino and goes out with LOSCHEK . RUDOLPH looks up at the picture of ELIZABETH p. 22 RUDOLPH We live too long  --  is that what you say , my mother , with the star in your hair ? A woman outtlives her beauty , a man outlives his dreams . When they painted you so , with the stars , there was brightness on your earth  --  dew on the lawns in spring . But now you walk the long cold Hofburg corridors at night  --  silent  --  and if you meet me there  --  your son  --  you look at me as if you walked the moon and men were strange . But then you 're all courtesy : and murmur " Rudolph , darling " and go on and it 's the moon again . We 're lost and damned here in the Hofburg . You know it ; you know I 'll find it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes twice outsideCount it out , count it , you bells that turned back Attila ! I 'm in my thirtieth year . There 's half a life left yet before I 'm cold . Would it be something gained if I 'd put roads and water enough between my corpus and Vienna , before I die , to evade that damned Capuchin church ? It reeks of Habsburgs and rotted kings . Must you rest there , dear mother , when you 're dead ? You tell me yes  --  they have plucked out the stars from your eyes and hair and made you ready . He sits hidden in the shadow . The place is quiet for a moment , then a MAID tiptoes in gently and goes to the fire-place . She busies herself with the fire , pausing meanwhile to listen . RUDOLPH moves . She rises quickly p. 23 GIRL I 'm sorry  --  I thought  --  everyone was gone . She starts out RUDOLPH Wait . GIRL Yes , Your Highness . I 'm sorry . RUDOLPH Who sent you here ? GIRL No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . RUDOLPH Yes , of course . GIRL I may go , sir ? RUDOLPH Yes . GIRL Thank you . RUDOLPH Wait again . Wait one moment . I know you . GIRL No , sir . RUDOLPH From many years ago . GIRL No , sir . RUDOLPH Oh , yes ! I troubled your innocence , I believe , and gave you money , and let you go . I 'm sorry . But why are you here ? GIRL It  --  happened . I earn my living here in the palace . RUDOLPH Who hired you ? GIRL The major domo . RUDOLPH And by what pretense of duty do you prowl my rooms after midnight ? p. 24 GIRL To see that  --  there 's no disorder  --  and they said you were gone  --  RUDOLPH This is the seventh . One after another I uncover them , these household spies they set on me . And this , this they thought was clever  --  a girl I 'd known , one with a protty face  --  I might slip again , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Emperor . GIRL No , no ! RUDOLPH Why not ? He pays preposterously . When you 're used and full of secrets you 'll be silenced with a pension and well guarded ! Who set you here and what were your instructions ? GIRL But it 's not  --  true  --  RUDOLPH You have a brain ! You know what happens when they hang a spy on the ramparts ! Tell me who 's your master , where you give your reports , who pays at the end of the week , or you 'll go back in a basket to this same major domo ! GIRL  --  Your Highness  --  RUDOLPH No lies  --  for I tell you I 'm sick of this spying ; they crawl in the walls like typhus-lice at plague-time ! By God , I 'll hang you in sheets from a bedpost ! GIRL No , my lord  --  no , truly . I 'm only here in the palace to earn my way  --  I 've said nothing about you . p. 25 RUDOLPH But I 'm not wrong . GIRL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've hurt my hand  --  please , will I lose my place ? RUDOLPH No . I was wrong . Forgive me . It gets under the skin and into the blood , the business of being a prince . In the end you fancy yourself a god , and all other flesh an offering to you . GIRL I know . RUDOLPH How do you know it ? GIRL It was so before . RUDOLPH Was it so even then , when I was twenty-three ? Perhaps it was  --  I took you , and paid you off . But it grows with the years , even though you know your flesh is grass like the rest , even though you swear it daily , still when they bring you food on gold , and armies tread the night to ensure your sleep , and when you stretch out your arm they run to make a garden  --  it taints the mind , this mindless service , till what you wish you must have , no matter how many bleed for it . I 'm unjust , and violent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd make you so in my place . And so , forgive me . GIRL I  --  forgive you ? RUDOLPH Yes . GIRL Yes , if you wish , Your Highness . p. 26 RUDOLPH I say this for myself  --  not for you , my dear . I 've schooled myself to live my birth down , make apology where apologies are due , though I writhe within to say the words . I thank you for your forgiveness . We 'll let it end there . GIRL falling on her knees , taking his hand . My lord , let me thank you  --  RUDOLPH No ! Keep off your knees ! LOSCHEK enters from withinYes ? LOSCHEK You 're not at liberty , Your Highness ? RUDOLPH What is it ? Yes . LOSCHEK There 's someone waiting . RUDOLPH Go now . THE GIRL . bows and slips out LOSCHEK The Baroness Vetsera 's here . RUDOLPH Let her in quickly . LOSCHEK If I may mention it , we suspect this girl  --  this that was on her knees . RUDOLPH I know  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look through the hall . LOSCHEK goes out after THE GIRL . RUDOLPH goes to the inner doorMarie ! p. 27 VETSERA at the door . May I come in ? RUDOLPH How did you come ? VETSERA Does it matter ? It 's snowing , sweet , and I walked through the snow , I was n't followed . I 'm sure I was n't . RUDOLPH It does n't matter now  --  now that I have you . Here 's a whole snowflake yet caught in your hair . Your cheeks are cool . Good God , how you transform a room ! VETSERA Do n't you want to kiss me ? RUDOLPH Does one make love with an angel , darling ? Wait  --  surely one should worship a little first , light a fire on an altar , or burn incense , and kneel in prayer . VETSERA But not to me . RUDOLPH Yes , sweet , to you . VETSERA Then all the gods grant all your prayers , as suddenly . She lifts her lips and he kisses herHave you been well ? RUDOLPH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . VETSERA I know , I saw you . LOSCHEK comes back unobtrusively through the roomGod in heaven , these two weeks ! Oh , Rudi , have you been lonely ? p. 28 RUDOLPH I 've been miserable , creeping about on trains , listening to welcomes , fat mayors of fat towns making fat speeches unto eternity , no word from you  --  VETSERA I could n't manage . Verily , I 'd have died only for your black blessed raven Loschek and the little note he dropped like manna in my prayer book . Then I took up heart and lived to see you . RUDOLPH Do you love me so much ? VETSERA And more , more than I tell you . RUDOLPH How long will it keep on ? VETSERA Oh , easily till I die .  --  And afterward  --  I doubt that it will be much different then . RUDOLPH Oh , child , child . VETSERA Oh , truly , Rudi ! I 'll die when you die  --  even if you should be away I 'd know if you were dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth was mine would find yours out and lie there with you . RUDOLPH Pretty . VETSERA And keep you warm  --  for there 'd be such a burning in the dust that used to be my heart , I 'd keep you warm deep under ground . You 'll know me by the fire there in the dust , and then we can make up for never having spent a whole night together  --  lying quite still , a long while . p. 29 RUDOLPH You speak too well . VETSERA Well , but I 've never spoken well before , and never will again . It 's now , for you . And then that 's all . RUDOLPH Surely you know , dear Mary , this is profitless passion for a girl whose family looks to her to marry the Indies and make her face their fortune . VETSERA Have I asked for money ? RUDOLPH No , God knows I 've none to give . VETSERA But then  --  my family does well enough . RUDOLPH Some time there will be reasons of state why I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Vatican , and bring the emperor down on us . Somehow they 'll ship me off to the east and you to the west and no amount of loving will help . You 'll find you have to wed a banker . Then your price will have gone down , after the scandal here , and I 'll have spoiled your name . VETSERA If it must be , it must . But if I marry , still I 'll love you  --  even if you go back to the Fleming  --  even  --  if  --  you should want to . RUDOLPH Would you love me then ? VETSERA Yes .  --  This is a bitter welcome  --  after so long away .  --  Do you wish me to go now ? p. 30 RUDOLPH No . VETSERA Will it be soon ? RUDOLPH I do n't know . VETSERA Yes . I wo n't ask for more than I can have . Only  --  let me see you while I can .  --  It can end  --  when it ends . RUDOLPH May I be eaten of worms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a letter I wrote two weeks ago to the sacred nose in Rome  --  and here 's a ring I 've carried in my pocket this two weeks to give you when you came ! But my damned soul has been so cursed and crawled upon with punks and serving men and women I feel the itch in every palm I touch , and taste the greed in every kiss ! VETSERA But I 'm greedy , too . Too greedy . RUDOLPH Look at the letter . VETSERA What is it ? RUDOLPH A petition , drawn up formally , wherewithals and flourish , requesting that the Pope annul my marriage with the Princess Stephanie , on sufficient grounds , that I may marry again . VETSERA Must you marry again ? RUDOLPH This ring 's to be yours . VETSERA But it 's a wedding ring . p. 31 RUDOLPH Perhaps if you should study it a little and look inside the circlet you might find a date graved . Now the dark blood climbs in your throat remembering . VETSERA This is worse than mockery ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire we could never marry . RUDOLPH No ? VETSERA With an empire waiting ? Marry a Baltazzi out of the east , a daughter of peddlers ? RUDOLPH Why then good-by to the empire ! They may keep it . And luck to them who get it . It 's been no luck to me . VETSERA Good-by to the empire ?  --  Now I know you mock me . I 'm a girl , foolish , and easily gulled , but this I know  --  no prince throws up an empire for a woman who 's been his for the asking . RUDOLPH Oh , Vienna ! The wisdom of Vienna ! All her daughters have eaten it with their porridge ! But it 's true that I 'm no jingling poet , to sell a crown for love and a pair of shoes . If I wanted empire , I 'd have the empire , and you , and Stephanie , and anything I whistled for ! But when I say the Habsburg crown 's an ancestral curse and I wo n't wear it , then the bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand closing on what I do and where I go , till the Hofburg 's a prison , the street 's a prison where I ride , with yielding walls , but iron and not to be broken through . Crown Prince I am , Crown Prince I must be . This is my answer to them : either I take the road free as a beggar , or from now on my life 's my own . I 've played their game , kept my intrigues hidden , held my tongue from comment on injustice , let myself be dangled like a golden calf on strings till I 'm at the end of my tether . I married once to barricade the throne , a Habsburg stallion led to a Leopoldine filly for the act of royal generation . That 's accomplished . Generation 's possible between whichever two of opposite sex they lock in a room together , young enough to have more appetite than brain . But now I shall marry where I please , say what I please in private or in public , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I shall have my way . p. 32 VETSERA And this ring 's for me ? RUDOLPH This ring 's for you . VETSERA How have I earned it , Rudi ? RUDOLPH I do n't know . There have been other women here in this room , a handsome company , I give my word , and where they went afterward concerned me only mildly . When you 've gone I hear your laughter dying down the hall and think you 're gone , but then you run in my veins like sun on Danube water , and your hair comes down between me and the book I write , and I curse you for a witch . This is for boys , this spring-sap madness , this magic in a feather , the one red feather in one girl 's dark hair , this dreaming at windows , memory of a perfume , this is for boys and girls , and not for me , but with you it 's mine again . And so we 'll keep it . Let them try to take it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to dare to wish , but now I 'm trembling  --  I do n't know why . What will come of us , Rudi ? What will they do ? RUDOLPH Why , for a time you 'll hear such a concaterwauling of horrid shrieks you 'll think Walpurgis night has broken outt in all the embassies . Little men will trot through palace doors with black briefcases packed with facts and papers . Hands will be upraised , friends estranged , lips bitten , beards gone white , hair turned gray on diplomatic heads , and a long growl will stem from the father walrus to crack like thunder down the Hofburg stairs and maybe split that curtain . Unseen hands will write on walls  --  prophetic cries will rend the midnight  --  vendors , likely , calling the news  --  but we ca n't listen to stuff like that forever , so we 'll go to sleep . p. 33 VETSERA I hope it comes to no more . RUDOLPH Would you be happy ? VETSERA You know that . RUDOLPH And not frightened when the wind comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinkers out of hell to roast the two of us ? VETSERA If you still want me I wo n't blench at hell . RUDOLPH Then they ca n't hurt us . They need me . I do n't need them . But I need you  --  and Q.E.D. , it follows . Make your peace at home , as best you can , for I 'm not content with these stolen interviews . We shall appear as often as we like together . VETSERA Then  --  I must tell you  --  there 's an arrangement made  --  lawyers and seals and signatures  --  I 'm not quite sure what all  --  it 's covert yet , but I 'm supposed to marry  --  RUDOLPH Yes ? VETSERA You see , I thought you 'd tire of me . They put me up for sale , no doubt , for so much cash . And I said yes , sometime  --  next year , perhaps . But now I 'll break it . RUDOLPH Yes , break it . VETSERA I had to tell you . You might have heard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man ? VETSERA Braganza . RUDOLPH Oh , the Duke . Well , tell the charming Duke  --  what will you tell him ? VETSERA That I was passing a palace when a prince came out who asked me to marry him , and suddenly , there in the midst of winter , it was spring , and so I 'm very sorry but  --  Rudi , Rudi , you 're angry ! RUDOLPH No . It 's just the ancient masculine aversion to the fact of other males in the world . But break it , to-morrow . VETSERA Yes .  --  And it 's true about the spring . I feel it like a trembling in the earth , this spring in winter . If I die of it I die of too much miracle . RUDOLPH It 's not death to love me . VETSERA There 'll be a storm  --  worse than you say . The birds nests will come down . RUDOLPH I 've never yet stood up before the emperor and said : this I intend to have ! but when I do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall have it . The ARCHDUKE JOHN of Tuscany comes in from the rear , LOSCHEK following , KOINOFF and SCEPS behind them both JOHN It will rain birds ' nest soup in Pesth before you rule if you ca n't keep your women out of conference ! p. 35 RUDOLPH Loschek ! JOHN Christ , do n't blame Loschek ! I walked in . We have an appointment here tonight  --  RUDOLPH No doubt you 've met the Baroness Vetsera  --  the Archduke John of Tuscany  --  a man who hides his brain under his lack of manners . LOSCHEK lights the candelabra and goes outt JOHN I 've heard of her . He bows RUDOLPH Behind him Captain Koinoff , behind him Herr Sceps of the Tageblatt . KOINOFF and SCEPS bow . She acknowledges the salute VETSERA Shall I leave you ? RUDOLPH No . You can hear this . JOHN Then we go back again . Pick up your boots , my friends , and set them down outside . Whatever it was we had to say ca n't wait , and we ca n't either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , my Salvator . The Baroness is in my confidence . JOHN But not in mine , if I can help it . I 've stuck my precious neck into a noose some dozen times this fort-night , all for your damn-fool Highness , and got it out by some fool luck each time . There 's such a thing as tempting the old lady with the shears just once too often . p. 36 RUDOLPH The Baroness Vetsera will be my wife when it can be arranged . If you trust me , trust her . The men bow . JOHN returns JOHN To MARYI beg your pardon . To RUDOLPHThis will take some doing , though . Your current wife has a king to her father . RUDOLPH Yes . That 's occurred to me . She can go home to her father . JOHN Give me your hand . I like you better . He takes RUDOLPH 's hand . To MARYI was burdened once with one of these royal frumps . She 's back with mama and I 've gone human with a chorus girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you 'll share with the prince , my dear . VETSERA I 'll chance it . JOHN Oh , I do n't doubt it . Where there 's purple blood a woman 's apt to chance it . Come , kiss her hand , captains and editors , before it 's royal  --  She 'll be more distant then . SCEPS and KOINOFF come forward KOINOFF kissing VETSERA 'S hand . May you be happy , Baroness . p. 37 VETSERA I thank you , Captain . SCEPS bending over the hand . May you make him happy . For he has n't been . VETSERA Thank you , too . JOHN I have this one half-hour , and things have happened since you galloped off on your trumpery progress . We 've talked a lot this year of liberties , rights , broken pledges to the people , what pressure we could bring on your father . Well , while we talked , there were rather more forthright fellows up and doing . It seems the Hungarians were eighteen jumps ahead of us  --  they 're on the verge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I do n't exaggerate  --  the train 's been laid for such a major explosion as might lift our sister state right out of Franz Joseph 's precinct and lay it in your lap . RUDOLPH Were these the lads called on the carpet for circulating pamphlets bearing my name ? JOHN No , no  --  that 's another thing though they meant business . That article you wrote for the Tageblatt , the authorship leaked out and several universities went berserk in Hungary  --  you know , boys yelling for blood , French style , the Marseillaise , and organizing under the Rudolph banner . The pedagogues were scandalized , but their innocents ran wild , got out of hand . p. 38 RUDOLPH And so they were expelled ? JOHN Right . RUDOLPH And that ends it . JOHN For the children , yes  --  but not for some others . Sceps , relate . SCEPS Your Highness , you know how carefully I 've preserved my head , believing , as I do , that a head 's essential even to a journalist . Your father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I want to live and raise my family and use my voice on the side of justice , so I 've walked warily and I 'm alive . But after this upheaval in the universities , when it had all died down , a young Hungarian noble came to see me here in Vienna , and questioned me point blank about your writings and yourself . I told him what I thought safe , and when he thought it safe he talked to me . He told me what we knew , that Hungary 's sick of the Empire , sick of your father , ready for fireworks . He is himself the head of a band of young aristocrats , all sworn to separate from Vienna or die trying , and they do n't expect to die . They mean to win ; they 've organized by cities , laid their plans  --  they 're ready to strike now  --  and what he wanted was to get word to you . They 've set themselves to make you king of Hungary . Oh , yes . Koinoff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's true  --  the town 's like a hive ready to swarm  --  with a royal word to lead them they 'd be on the wing to-night  --  to-morrow  --  when you say . p. 39 RUDOLPH And your advice , Sceps ? SCEPS This is one time , Your Highness , when I would risk my head . I 've fought oppression all my life long , and got nowhere , your father being the man he is . We might at least see an enlightened and liberal Hungary break off from Austria . RUDOLPH Tell me the name of this young noble . SCEPS SZOGYENY . You know him . RUDOLPH Yes . And Captain Koinoff ? KOINOFF I 'm somewhat less dismayed by the word treason , Highness , than Herr Sceps , who has a family and a paper . I have nothing but a life that I 'd exchange for , say , a thought more freedom in the world  --  and we wo n't get it while the emperor sits where he sits in comfort . RUDOLPH As for the Archduke , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose but a starveling dukedom and a gangling neck , whereas you have imperial prospects , likewise an imperial rack of bones on which to hang a crown if you should get one . But your crown wo n't be worth having if you wait long for it , in my opinion . Five or six more years as things go now and the Habsburg coronets will rate with barrel-hoops on the market . This is not our plot , this blaze in Hungary ; it burst out ready made ; it 's real , it 's hot , it 's simple ; it began when your mother took her first trip to their capitol , and begged some mitigation of the penalties your father laid on independent speech when he was young and brash . She got her way because he was in love , and since that time the Magyars worship her and you because they think you 're two of a kind . No doubt you are , and you could give them the government they want and they 'd follow you through brass . But take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you pluck it when it 's ripe or not at all . It wo n't keep on the tree . p. 40 RUDOLPH You think it 's ripe ? JOHN I know it is . RUDOLPH What would you have me do ? JOHN Talk with Szogyeny . RUDOLPH And then I 'd be committed . JOHN No . Not at all . RUDOLPH How does your word go , Mary ? VETSERA You should n't ask me . RUDOLPH Why ? VETSERA I know too little . JOHN It 's pretty plain if you two want to break loose and live together , this is your chance for it , They wo n't allow it here . RUDOLPH But you flatter me , you lads , when you assume that if I ruled the Magyars they 'd be compensated for a war , a bloody war  --  yes , and a lost one  --  with a loss of liberties , and the fees imposed by victors on the vanquished . I do n't list my set of bones and necessary features among the major risks  --  but as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one piece , and I 'd fain , fain keep them so . JOHN Then I 'm off for Rome and a boat , and the South Seas ! Save your fat neck and I 'll save mine ! p. 41 RUDOLPH If your nobility implies that what you 've told me will go further you hardly do me justice . I 'll be silent . Yes , if the project smelled a little less of the moon and more of the earth , I might be tempted to listen further . KOINOFF It 's not lunacy , Your Highness , truly . As a student of tactics I should say , with the disposition of troops as it was three days ago , when I left Buda , there 's little room for doubt that we could snatch control of Hungary . It just so happens that three of this pledged band we told you of are generals  --  two of them in command of two main key positions . A sudden movement made by night and both the capital cities would be ours , the approaches under ourr guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will write , you will talk , you will singe the old man 's beard with words , but when we need an eagle dropping like thunder on the lambs , you perch on your eyrie , in other words your rump , and gaze at the sun and make snide comments on the smell of the moon around our enterprise ! You talk to soldiers , and it 's you that 's moonstruck ! Back through recorded time no prince was ever offered such a kingdom on such a platter  --  they had to fight for theirs , the Alexanders and the rest ! RUDOLPH I 'm not an Alexander . What he stood for slipped down the black hills in a very bloody sunset when the first Napoleon died . There are two reasons why I might wish to rule in Hungary ; let us look at them calmly . First , if tho empire drifts as it 's drifting now , it will smash up and I 'll be left nothing to rule . Second , if I were king I might inaugurate reforms which I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time to stave off ruin . Well , they 're both fallacious , both these reasons . If I seize on Hungary , there 'll be a war , and all reform wiped out for a decade , what advance we 've planned toward tolerant government will be ridden down not only in Austria , but by my orders in Hungary , and the empire will break up for the same sweet reasons we have now  --  dragoons on every peasant 's back  --  the forms of law with absolutism behind them . Add to that that I , on whom you pin your hopes of freedom , would go the way of all the Habsburgs , lose my liberal principles one by one , be driven to give them up to hold a realm together , and once committed to the adventure , doomed to be my father over again , I 'd catch at desperate expedients , fill the gaps in the falling walls with more and more lives of men ; acts of oppression , made to stiffen the line , would harden into policies , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead to build new bastions where more men might die defending me , and my throne ! If you 're a soldier you should know this . p. 42 JOHN Have you read in history of any age when men have not been foreed to fight for freedom ? SCEPS There are times , Your Highness , when the means are rendered gracious by the end , though the means be evil . No war lasts forever , nor would you change so much . RUDOLPH And that 's fallacy ! A government will end as it begins , and if it builds on slaughter it will stand on slaughter till it falls ! SCEPS But they all begin so ! RUDOLPH And they all end so ! But I 'll not begin with murder that breeds murder to the end , and whip my conscience into a corner with " But this was needed for the ultimate good of my dear subjects . " When this same ultimate good is but to die in a corner with my conscience to make me a dull king ! For no other purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you mean that men should sit and bleat because the butchers have sharp knives , like a batch of calves and lambs in the slaughter-yard ! Bleat and then run away to get their throats slit later ! RUDOLPH It sounds to you like cowardice , and it may be all thinking has the effect of making us less apt to spit at danger . Insofar as he thinks a man is much more cowardly than a lion , but he may live longer , may even get his way more surely . Something a soldier would n't know , but I offer it . p. 43 JOHN You have a plan ? RUDOLPH Why only this  --  that I know a bad plan when I see it , and I 'd rather wait . There have been instances of men who stalked the forces of the dark and caught them napping , men in whom indirection and a long patience stood them in better stead than force of arms . I 'm not a patient man , but I 'm trying to learn patience . JOHN By God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  --  but you give me practice , with your half  --  cock schemes ! I tell you I 've looked beyond you and caught a vision of what a man might do if he were king . And having that vision in me I 've set myself to make myself a man and unlearn kingliness , shed it like the rag it is , till a king stands up a man , but a man with power to make men free ! VETSERA May I speak now , now that I 've listened , Rudolph ? RUDOLPH Yes . VETSERA I 've heard you talk of danger , all of you , but it seems you do n't know what the word means , It means dying  --  cruelly  --  dungeons without air .  --  For Rudolph . if one least whisper of this goes beyond the room , who could answer for it , who could guess how long he 'd live ? You say we might be happy in Hungary . It 's not true . The emperor watches these things , and knows them before they happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knock at the door p. 44 RUDOLPH Loschek ! Loschek enters , crosses to the right , opens the door and steps out for a moment . He returns somewhat shaken LOSCHEK Your Highness , the emperor is here and wishes to see you . RUDOLPH Very well . He dismisses his guests with a gesture LOSCHEK And asks , particularly , that your friends remain here with you . For he wishes to see them also . RUDOLPH Good . My friends remain . Will you open the door for the emperor ? LOSCHEK opens the door , bowing . FRANZ JOSEPH enters , dusty and humble . TAAFE follows FRANZ JOSEPH I intrude at a ghoulish hour , my son . This end of the night 's for revelling when we 're young . I too kept revel late , in my day , and understand it  --  yes , and grieve to interrupt you . When your years begin to dwindle like the coins a child lakes in his hand to carnival , you 'll know why days are precious to me , till I work long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what seems deadly urgent . RUDOLPH You 're quite welcome , Your Majesty . And we 're not , as you call it , revelling . A listener might have guessed that we were serious . p. 45 FRANZ JOSEPH A symposium ! Well , I ca n't add to that . My thinking 's done . We get that over early , we of the Habsburgs , I 'm afraid , and then we settle down to take things as they come . They come so fast there 's little time for thinking . RUDOLPH Am I in error or did you ask that these my guests remain to hear our conference ? FRANZ JOSEPH It 's no conference ! I'merely wished to see you and your guests  --  these guests you have . No blenching , gentlemen ! Be easy ! I do n't ask you why you 're here nor what 's been said ! God 's love , we talk a lot back in our twenties when our heads are light with such a lack of birthdays ! RUDOLPH Do you wish to make the acquaintance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . We wo n't spend our time in greetings but say what we came to say . I have in hand a copy of your missive to the Pope , sent without consultation . May I ask the meaning of it ? RUDOLPH I thought the meaning plain . FRANZ JOSEPH You wish to marry again ? RUDOLPH I do . FRANZ JOSEPH Your friends have heard of this from you ? RUDOLPH They have . p. 46 FRANZ JOSEPH But I  --  I have not . You are aware , of course , that marriages within the Habsburg line are subject to imperial control without exception ? RUDOLPH Yes . FRANZ JOSEPH It should be apparent that you have made your prayers to the wrong throne . This is a temporal matter . One in which I take an interest . One that concerns the state which I have undertaken , under God , to lead and guide , while I have strength to do it , and which I must not suffer to be torn by minor loves and whims . RUDOLPH This is no whim , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was . Your pardon . Where has your fancy fallen then , in its latest phase ? RUDOLPH Outside the conventions , sir . I 've chosen the Baroness Vetscra . THE EMPEROR bows to MARY FRANZ JOSEPH Yes . And so I had supposed . And I must still be blunter than I like . It 's known that you 've received the lady 's favors in advance of bell and candle . Or at least your wife has so informed the cardinal . These things are winked at . You will tire of her , and she , I hope , will tire of you . Play out your play . As for divorce and marriage to her , that I utterly refuse . A child in arms should have more foresight . p. 47 RUDOLPH If Your Majesty will fix it in your mind that we are not quite children here , it may be possible to find some common ground on which ourr wills can meet ! I am not sorry for this visit . For I have wished to tell you for some time what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have been wiser . RUDOLPH Not only in regard to my divorce , but in a graver matter . For my wife . I was too much a child when I allowed your word to bed me with a well-intentioned but very dull young princess . Being grown , and somewhat more , I shall arrange details of this sort for myself . FRANZ JOSEPH Forgive me.  --  And as to the graver matter you speak of ? RUDOLPH Why , this Austria , this kingdom of the east , the Oestereich , you govern it , you bred this son of yours , myself , to govern it , set me to some five hundred tutors , one behind another , till I 'd crammed my skull with usage and prerogatives and law , till I was read blind on usages and trash and like a fool I turned to drink , or women  --  the easy women you presented me to cut my man 's teeth on , and keep me quiet when I was less than docile . Now I 'm sick of this your training , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pretty what was stored inside my carcass . What have I found instilled in me to make me king  --  to fit me to be king  --  ? the morals of a wolf in a court of wolves and bitches , such a pride in decorations as might become an ape , no truth , no honor , no faith in a man 's word or a woman 's , stealth and craft in brigandage , hyena 's appetites for flattery that smells , resentment of all honesty lest it should cut too deep and show me what I am , the tongue of a bootblack licking out coins , but underneath a cold analytical fury , a knowledge that all friends are dangerous , all men enemies  --  p. 48 FRANZ JOSEPH But thus  --  thus is mankind , at heart . RUDOLPH This is myself and you  --  no other man in the world excepting those who are trained like you and me to rule this outpost of disaster , Europe ! FRANZ JOSEPH Well , kings do not grow on bushes . They are made as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must pass through fire , like steel the blade is sharper for it . And harder . RUDOLPH Sharp and hard , and withered at the entrails , like a headsman bred up to deal out death , and never flick an eyelid with his shoes awash in blood from crying children ! FRANZ JOSEPH What child have I sent to death ? RUDOLPH Too many ! A pause FRANZ JOSEPH May I ask that you state briefly what meaning you may wish me to attach to these hot cries from your heart ? For you do mean them  --  but I have not understood . RUDOLPH If it were quite plain to me , I might make it so to you . But I wish to leave the court , live like a commones , choose some obscure village where I 'll touch the earth from time to time without these damnable footmen to spread rugs on it . I want no guards round me , no authority , no rank ; I want to sink my roots outside this hot-house , where I 'm kept at even temperatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because I had a brain one time , but under this contagion of flattery and power and sycophance a brain ca n't live . I break down cell by cell , day by day , toward that quick ulcerous growth men call a king , a tumor on the lives of men , with no other function than to spread , grow and eat , rot into the body politic , spraddle out , a witless fungus , a running sore , an evil on what men have and are ! p. 49 FRANZ JOSEPH And you would take this lady with you to the obscure village for contact with the soil ? RUDOLPH I would . FRANZ JOSEPH But then  --  you would return ? RUDOLPH If ever I were needed I would return . FRANZ JOSEPH Do you not comprehend that knowledge , skill and use are necessary in managing a realm ? An untried horseman on an unbroken colt might yet stick on , but Austria , where we ride wild horses tandem , Austria would trample down an unpracticed rider before he was well mounted . RUDOLPH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOSEPH Count Taafe and I are here to-night to ask that , from to-night , you take a place on one of those hard stools that face his desk , and share our councils . We 're not young , the Count and I. We need you as apprentice to take the business over when an old king says good night to an old kingdom . RUDOLPH Then  --  I shall seem most ungrateful , but it 's true that I would rather never reign at all than reign as you have reigned . FRANZ JOSEPH We need new blood , a fresh voice , modern ways . What you have to say , we 'll listen to it . p. 50 RUDOLPH My first advice would be to grant autonomy to Hungary ; open the franchise to all men of age to vote , reseind restrictions on free speech and press throughout the empire , wipe outt clean all laws that make political crime , swing open the gates of political prisons . Sign away to parliament the power to make and change all laws , keep for yourself executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . This is an empire , not a democracy . No king has ever given till he must what you ask me to toss away . RUDOLPH Our Habsburg house has been a cancer on mankind , a fluke that eats till the host dies ! Its power 's cancerous , destroying what it lives on , yes , and itself , as it 's destroyed your brain and eats at mine to make me also what all emperors have been , blind parasitic poisonous mouths sucking at arteries . When you came to the throne , the day you came to power , you signed and sealed four hundred warrants of execution , death to four hundred men , your enemies . Since then you have continued as that day began , feeding your strength on blood , your tentacles sinking in deeper , spreading out further , till no man dare whisper in an empty room lest you should reach and touch him . And what for ? To build for you an arrogant machine in middle Europe that will feel its way , crushing and grinding men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensions of degenerating tissue and disease of which you make the center ! This machine is under way , and moves colossally inch by inch , and every inch it crawls it nears a precipice over which we 'll go and all of Europe with us ! p. 51 FRANZ JOSEPH And now indeed I understand you , though your flux of figures takes some unravelling . Still my dull old head asks further enlightenment . How would one rule better if one ruled better ? RUDOLPH As if the lives of men were precious things , as if men 's happiness was precious as your own . Under your hand men tend toward maggots , with like mouths and brains as grow in their masters  --  such cheese loving souls that one could curse the high permitting stars that give them leave to crawl ! For your machine has but one purpose , to iron and discipline till men and lives are so much mud and death in a game in which the stakes are mud and death for enemies and friends ! FRANZ JOSEPH And under your rule there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enmities ? RUDOLPH Who gains by wars but the kings ? Let the people choose war or peace . FRANZ JOSEPH But there 's no choice . There was a time when plagues and famines kept the populations down , but in our wisdom we have dispensed with famines and with plagues , and nations press against their boundaries incontinent , spawning more children on both sides , till they knock the chips from one another 's shoulders and snatch the food from one another 's mouths and fight for standing room . Those who fight best will live , and those who will not fight will die . Shall we choose to die ? Will you choose it when you 're king ? The kaiser of Germany is just your age , or nearly , William the Second , a crafty boy but not your equal . What he dreams there in Prussia is dominating Europe . His machine is building up like ours . The time will come when he will set his foot down on your lines and two great empires , equal in wealth and men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , not peace , our Rudolph against their William , our Habsburg against their Hohen-zollern . Then the outcome hangs on who 's the better man , and there the Habsburgs have it . Not in my time has any prince in Europe shown a promise , a quickness , a grace , an aptness in all arts of war and peace , such as in you , my son , recalls an ancient glory . It rests with you whether Austria shall live . A pause . There is a clatter of rifle-butts on the floor outside p. 52 A VOICE outside.Halt ! ANOTHER VOICE outside.You must wait here , madame . A THIRD VOICE outside.The emperor is here , and you must wait . ELIZABETH outside.The emperor is here  --  and I must wait ? I am the Empress Elizabeth , if you please , and I will not wait . THE THIRD VOICE outside.Let her pass . LOSCHEK has slipped in from the inner rooms . At a nod from RUDOLPH he opens the door . ELIZABETH enters . The men bow . RUDOLPH goss to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , ELIZABETH Thank you . To FRANZ JOSEPHI came to bring a word from you to Rudolph , but you 're here before me . LOSCHEK goes within FRANZ JOSEPH I 've little more to say , and I 'll be gone . When a man 's old as I am , suddenly all he wagered on his youth , his dreams , what he tried to do , transfer themselves to the person of his son . You may not love me ; whether I love you I do n't know , it may mean much or little , this clutching at the throat where you 're concerned . But surely what I 've dreamed and hoped , and poured my passion and my days to serve and rescue , these are holy things : the honor of the Habsburgs ' thousand years , which now devolves on you , the circle of ground which we call Austria , held toward east and west through many bloody , endless , desperate wars down to this hour . These you must help me keep . And you must take my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear and free of slander , such as would come of this divorce and contemplated marriage . You must not impugn your place . You must not leave the court for mad al fresco venturing . It 's fatal ten thousand different ways . And so I ask your word on both these matters . p. 53 RUDOLPH You ask my word that I 'll not leave Vienna , will not divorce my wife , will not remarry ? FRANZ JOSEPH Yes . RUDOLPH It 's easy to say that for the honor of our race , and to preserve our fatherland , men 's blood must be poured down the old dynastic rat-hole as in the past . I say if that were true I 'd have no interest in the government , nor in our fatherland , nor the tapestry of wars and madness our mad ancestors the Habsburgs wove , and in which their acts and features are doubtful decorations . What 's the way out , how men are to save themselves from repetitions of that same tapestry in still more wars and blood down the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might find out , in some other atmosphere than this . I shall leave the court . The Baroness goes with me where I go . And I shall ask , publicly , for a divorce . FRANZ JOSEPH I 'm very sorry . RUDOLPH I 'm sorry that we must differ . FRANZ JOSEPH I 'm very sorry that to maintain much more than discipline I must interfere with your wishes . I know this lady better than you do . She must be shut away . Oh , in her mother 's house , where she 'll feel at home ; and to put her more at ease , perhaps her jailor should be the man she 's pledged to marry . p. 54 RUDOLPH Sir , you grow childish . FRANZ JOSEPH When we deal with children , with wilful children , we must sometimes adopt a childish method . I have known your mother to glance off at these tangents in her time , and thank me later for restraints . ELIZABETH A woman 's easily broken . Take care how you anger Rudolph . You wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where our treasure is  --  you 've read it in Holy Writ . Rudolph will stay in Vienna . RUDOLPH From this hour I do and say and go as I please . FRANZ JOSEPH Why then  --  it 's as I said . Taafe , the guard was needed , and you were right after all . TAAFE Shall I call them ? FRANZ JOSEPH Yes . TAAFE steps to the door and opens it RUDOLPH The royal guard ! FRANZ JOSEPH I do regret it , Rudolph . RUDOLPH You will regret it . TAAFE Come in . You 're to make an arrest . Two OR THREE SOLDIERS enter , an OFFICER following p. 55 FRANZ JOSEPH This lady goes wisth us . RUDOLPH Your Majesty , this is opera bouffe ! To arrest her in my rooms ! FRANZ JOSEPH It will not be printed . You may trust our discretion , Herr Sceps and me . Even the Archduke John will curb his tongue . You were lately in Buda  --  Pesth , were you not , sir ? JOHN No , Your Majesty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor of this either . To MARYWill you come ? RUDOLPH She 'll stay where she is . FRANZ JOSEPH Oh , now I beg of you , no words , no violence ! To MARYMy guest for the evening only , and then your mother 's . As I 've said I know you better than Rudolph . VETSERA Yes . I 'll go . She looks once at RUDOLPH , then walks out through the soldiers . The OFFICER and the soldiers go with her RUDOLPH You count on your gray hair and greasy words too much ! You 've never seen me angry  --  but by your own everlasting God you may find such a change in me as we 'll regret  --  both of us  --  if you let her walk between soldiers three steps farther  --  ! p. 56 FRANZ JOSEPH I should think less of you and the metal in you if you showed no temper at such a moment . Be angry . It will pass , and you 'll think better of it . There are matters much more important than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly , across my face . No man , since I was crowned , has spoken so to me , nor will and go unpunished . RUDOLPH But I have , and will , and will again ! What do you gain by this ? FRANZ JOSEPH Time  --  and your presence here in Vienna  --  on which we set a value . But mainly time  --  the only cure I know for adolescent ills . I wish you well . I 'm cruel to be kind . But when to be kind I must be cruel , I use no half  --  measures . Reflect on that . And when you 're cooler try if there 's a way to my clemency . He bows and goes out with COUNT TAAFE RUDOLPH This is the ultimate in degradation  --  to come here ready with a squad of soldiers and take her like a criminal ! It 's second childhood , and empty posturing . ELIZABETH It was n't empty once when a squad of soldiers visited my lodging in Madeira . Oh , it 's known that I was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . The man was Imry . We thought we 'd kept it secret , but this rank of guardsmen came  --  in their comic opera fashion  --  without warrant or warning , and what was done with him I never knew . Perhaps the Baroness will not be seen again . p. 57 RUDOLPH But that 's not possible ! ELIZABETH It 's happened . Oh , to make a hole in the earth and lay an unwanted body in it , that 's quite possible . What we call civilization is built on dead men 's silence . RUDOLPH What can be done ? ELIZABETH Nothing . He has his way . RUDOLPH But not with me ! ELIZABETH I hope not . JOHN Now will you take this Hungary we offer you , and pay him back in his coin , or will you sit here still in your fine detachment . contemplating destiny ? RUDOLPH What in God 's name do I want with Hungary ? JOHN Make her queen of it , make yourself king . Look , Rudolph , if you strike before he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it and be off across the border , to a new kingdom , while he 's still awaiting your apology ! RUDOLPH We have no arms , no plans , no men  --  JOHN I 'll find you fifty within six hours ! ELIZABETH And now I could almost hope . RUDOLPH For what ? ELIZABETH That he 'll be broken . p. 58 SCEPS He has information . He knew we 'd been in Buda . ELIZABETH He has little . He sent me here with a bit of cold advice for Rudolph 's ear , that some of his hot  --  head friends might find their heads in danger . SCEPS That 's enough . ELIZABETH No , no ! It only means he plays for time and is n't ready for you . RUDOLPH It 's a madman 's scheme , incredible as a nightmare . No sane man would believe it might be tried , or might succeed . Unless doors open of themselves and walls come down on hinges . Yet it may be they do after this nightmare we 've lived through , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large with paranoia . Find your fifty men , and we 'll raid the Baltazzi palace . JOHN There 's fire in the man ! RUDOLPH Do you think I 'm tame ? SCEPS I 'll drop out . I 've given too many hostages . JOHN Save yourself and your paper . You say we 'll raid the palace  --  and after that what happens ? RUDOLPH What else could happen  --  then we 'll try for Hungary . JOHN takes RUDOLPH 's hand JOHN Koinoff , come in . Your hand on this . p. 59 KOINOFF Oh , count on me . JOHN The devil drink his eyes that breaks this pact . SCEPS Put me in too . Good God , we die sometime . JOHN That 's better . That makes ourr circle . RUDOLPH And now I set my hand to it I 'll go as far as your best madmen . If he wants war he shall have war . Mother , you 're one of us . ELIZABETH steps toward the circle of men and then pauses ELIZABETH I wish I might . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch it with my hand . The lips and hands I 've aided in rebellion , they 're all cold . There 's an old fatality in me that I outlive all those with whom I league against him . Make your compact , you who are young and may be lucky . I am a wraith of things long dead and buried . I must not burden you with griefs past sounding . She turns to go@@ SCENE .  --  The following evening in the study of FRANZ JOSEPH . This time the room is fully revealed and is seen to be of ample size and exquisitely furnished . An inner door at the left leads to the EMPEROR 'S apartments , the outer door is at the right . Near the entrance at the right sits the MAID who has been seen previously in RUDOLPH 'S room . The BARONIN VON NEUSTADT stands near her . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT My dear , it would hardly do if you were to be found sitting when the Emperor entered , would it , now ? GIRL No , madam . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baronin von Neustadt , for ineffable reasons , may be found seated , even by royalty , on condition that she rises immediately to meet such an august occasion . She sits GIRL Yes , madam . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT Pardon me those hornbook lessons in deportment , but as you rise higher in the state you will find them more and more to your advantage , perhaps even obligatory . You have not been summoned previously to this Holy of Holies ? THE GIRL is silent There  --  the fault was mine  --  you must not violate a confidence . And yet , I know your business here very well , since it 's the same as my own , perfidious wretch that I am . I sell information for pin money , my husband being sometimes a little to the windward of lavish , and you do the same for bread and butter  --  therefore your secret 's safe with me and mine with you . p. 61 GIRL I have no secret , madam . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT Excellent ! And so dewily , so fragrantly , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jowl , petticoat to petticoat , the above  --  stairs smothering its knowledge in words , the below-stairs in silence  --  but still in perfect understanding , baronin and parlor-maid , for next to death there is no leveller of classes like espionage . But what levels us is that we find it a rather despicable business , and despise ourrselves and each other in our hearts . GIRL Despise ourselves ? BARONIN VON NEUSTADT Do n't you ? GIRL No . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT No ? Come , come , my dear , there are a half-dozen of us waiting to clear up some minor doubt that balks the imperial will in respect to Rudolph . A very nasty occupation ; and we take money for it . GIRL I hate him . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT rising . Truly ? But then you have a reason . No doubt he has given reasons , though none to me . No , my interest is purely mercenary , and I sink below you in my estimation . Occupy the chair , my dear , and I shall stand . GIRL Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VON NEUSTADT Strange , strange , how a woman will love a man for robbing her of youth and filling her with innumerable children , while she will hate him forever if he gives her back to herself with her good looks intact and only a memory of pleasure to remind her of him ! There , there  --  I meant nothing by it . My remarks , as usual , are for the ambient air , and by no stretch treasonous . The inner door opens , and COUNT TAAFE enters TAAFE You will oblige me by waiting in the anteroom for a moment , Baronin von Neustadt . I have a word to say to this young woman . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT Surely , Taafe , surely . Ah , my child , you will go far . You already take precedence . She goes out right TAAFE What was she saying to you ? GIRL Only , sir , that sir knew my business very well , because it was the same as her own . TAAFE Very true , and quite democratic of her , though indiscreet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and makes it serve her ends . Whatever you do do n't attempt to emulate her in that direction . GIRL No , sir . TAAFE So far , and so far as I know , you 've been close-mouthed under strong temptation . Remain so , and we shall continue to be pleased . p. 63 GIRL Yes , sir . TAAFE Your instructions this evening are very simple . There is , or is likely to be , somewhere in the Prince Rudolph 's apartments , a list of Hungarian officers and noblemen . If you can lay your hand on it , copy what you can without risk , or memorize as much of it as you have time for The list may not be there at all , as I say . Someone else may have it , or he may carry it upon his person . But we need it quickly and desperately , and you may happen on it if you try . GIRL Yes , sir . TAAFE That 's all . GIRL Thank you , sir . She goes out . A LITTLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rauscher , that the Crown Prince was in his apartments last night while you were amusing yourself at the Tzigan dancer 's ? RAUSCHER I followed his domino , sir , and it was a man of just his build . What 's more , he must have been imitating the prince 's walk . You 'd have sworn to it yourself . TAAFE I hope you know who it was ? RAUSCHER I know now . It was Bratfisch , the coachman . TAAFE As it happens it does n't matter this time , because we had other information . But for the future , you have your instructions . Do n't be misled again . p. 64 RAUSCHER No , sir . TAAFE That 's all . RAUSCHER bows and goes out . THE BARONIN reenters BARONIN VON NEUSTADT Your most humble servant . TAAFE My dear baronin , your extremely agile and provocative tongue may sometime dig you a bear-pit so deep and wide that God and man will not be able to extricate you from it . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT Ah , luckless that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it just as well to avoid communication with others of ourr  --  shall I say our under-cover staff ? As you must be aware , ideas are poisonous to the unsophisticated mind , and you are unfortunately not devoid of certain helter-skelter philosophic concept  --  BARONIN VON NEUSTADT Oh , you do me too much honor ! TAAFE Concepts of a corrupting character which pervade your very charming conversation , and which do you no harm , but might well pervert a simple faith or taint an untutored devotion . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT I love that . TAAFE Curb yourself , my dear baronin . No further remarks of any kind to the little serving-maid . It may not have occurred to you , but there are only two ways out of the ranks you entered when you consented to employ yourself on our little missions . One of them is an honorable discharge after years of undeviating and scrupulous fidelity . The other we shall not speak of , but it would entail the loss of many things which at present make life endurable to you  --  first and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 65 BARONIN VON NEUSTADT And I may not resign ? TAAFE There is no third alterative . And let me say that the mere suspicion that you wish to resign is enough to place you in a most precarious position . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT I have no wish to do so . I merely asked . TAAFE Good . The rest is business . You have seen the Baroness Vetsera ? BARONIN VON NEUSTADT Yes . TAAFE She is still rather disconsolate , no doubt ? BARONIN VON NEUSTADT I should guess so , though you will agree that she has her reasons for being fairly monosyllabic toward me  --  knowing me as she does . TAAFE There is no possible manner in which she might correspond with Rudolph ? BARONIN VON NEUSTADT There 's but one door to her room , dear count . It 's locked , and the Duke of Braganza keeps the key . No servants are allowed to enter , her mother being thoroughly on your side in this business . TAAFE The Duke , I hope , is a jealous man ? BARONIN VON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her an excellent husband . He is , for the moment , an excellent jailor . p. 66 TAAFE It was he who admitted you to see her ? BARONIN VON NEUSTADT At your request , yes . TAAFE It would be annoying if she hanged herself , or threw herself from the window . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT Oh , but she 's young , passionate and full of hope . She will be quite as passionate in another direction once she 's married to the Duke . TAAFE These women are cynical about each other . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT We have reason to be . FRANZ JOSEPH enters from the left TAAFE turns to him deferentially , THE BARONIN bows FRANZ JOSEPH Have you heard from Koinoff ? TAAFE No , Your Majesty . I 've expected him since three o'clock . FRANZ JOSEPH Will you ask the baronin whether she knows of any faint suspicion that Captain Koinoff may be less than wholehearted in our cause ? TAAFE You know , my dear baronin , that Koinoff has been entrusted with a delicate commission in connection with Rudolph . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him this morning , but now , just when we stand in dire need of further information , he has failed an appointment to meet us , and is all of six or seven hours behind-hand  --  with no word from him . p. 67 BARONIN VON NEUSTADT Oh , but he may be entangled in such a fashion that it would give his hand away to leave  --  TAAFE True , but for seven hours , and when we depend on him utterly  --  How much did you know of him when he was first recommended to us ? BARONIN VON NEUSTADT Only that he was clever , needed money , and looked honest . TAAFE But now we find that he was employed in Berlin under Prince Bismarck before coming to Vienna  --  in some quasisecretarial capacity . He left Berlin under a firly noxious cloud . In fact , it 's probable that he 's had a startlingly wide experience in double-tonguing and quick exits . That his schooling was with the Jesuits has not added to our confidence . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT I had no notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vetsera girl was also your recommendation you will comprehend why we grow slightly uneasy about the character of your friends . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT But that  --  nobody could foresee . She fell in love . There is a knock at the door , and a SERVANT enters THE SERVANT Captain Koinoff is here , Count Taafe. p. 68 TAAFE Ah , that alters matters . Send him in at once . The SERVANT goes outWe excuse the baronin , thoroughly re-instated in our good opinion . BARONIN VON NEUSTADT Exonerated by accident , Your Majesty  --  in the casual manner of this world we live in . FRANZ JOSEPH My dear , the appalling amount of accident in the bestgoverned dominions is hardly flattering to a king . THE BARONIN bows and goes outAnd yet we must get rid of this woman . Her tongue is like an open razor in the hands of a child . KOINOFF enters and bows KOINOFF Your Majesty  --  Count Taafe  --  TAAFE You are late , sir . KOINOFF Indeed I am , and I 've been bleeding inwardly over it ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the list ? KOINOFF No . I expect to get it this evening . TAAFE But you have gathered the most important names ? KOINOFF Only Szogyeny . TAAFE Come , come , Captain Koinoff , you have Rudolph 's entire confidence , you are acting as military advisor to the leaders , there is an all-important list of rebelling Hungarians on the table before you , and you fail to memorize one additional name . p. 69 KOINOFF But the list has not been displayed , it has not been discussed in my presence , and I ca n't ask for it , as you must realize TAAFE You could angle for it , and if you were adroit you would have got it long ago . In your capacity of tactical expert you can express doubt of their strength in the west  --  they will answer by identifying their allies in that region . You can demand specific information as to their support from ranking officers in Buda-Pesth  --  they will reply by enumerating certain members of the clique  --  KOINOFF They have given that information in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding among them that their confederates are to remain anonymous till they 're ready to strike  --  TAAFE And when will that be ? KOINOFF smiling . We plan to rescue the Baroness Vetsera from the Baltazzi palace and leave for Hungary to-night . TAAFE A sufficiently hair-brained project . KOINOFF And easily prevented . FRANZ JOSEPH But it must be apparent to you , Captain Koinoff , that before we move openly to prevent it we must have in our hands the names of my sworn enemies in Hungary . Otherwise I may never know them . And until I know them I can take no steps to forestall a much more serious thing , a major and well-planned revolution in Hungary , with or without Rudolph . p. 70 KOINOFF Yes , Your Majesty . FRANZ JOSEPH Then I shall expect you here with at least a portion of that list before midnight . If we have some of them we can get the rest . No doubt your heroic little band is even now in a fever of preparation ? KOINOFF Yes , it is , Your Majesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . KOINOFF bows and goes out TAAFE The movement of troops into Hungary has been taken care of Several trains left at seven this evening and others will follow during the night . I was obliged to entrain the Seventh . Corps , because no other could be got ready on short notice . It leaves Vienna almost entirely unprotected , but I felt that the emergency required it , and we run no risk here . FRANZ JOSEPH It may be all these things come home to roost , sometime , what we 've been and done . I see them camp round us to-night . There 's a shadow of black wings between me and the candles . Well , my ways have not been pretty always . TAAFE That 's the voice of a man who needs his sleep . FRANZ JOSEPH I could use some sleep if I could sleep . But that 's not what it is . It 's that this ruling as I 've ruled is like a child 's sand castle by the sea . It stands with flags and soldiers till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time , and then in one great wash it 's gone . Perhaps the tide is due now . We 've both seen it on the flats in Hungary , and it 's not turned yet . p. 71 TAAFE My king , this is a morbid strain , and baseless . There 's no danger in these youngsters . FRANZ JOSEPH It 's their world , and we 're old men , hanging on by our last half-hours , alive by a legal fiction . There 's something forgotten , something we 've overlooked that makes it fatal , and I do n't know what it is . CURTAIN p. 72 Act 2 , Scene 2 SCENE TWO SCENE .  --  A small section of RUDOLPH 'S room , including the portrait of THE EMPRESS , the desk beneath it , and a number of chairs which have been pulled up to the desk for a study of maps and schedules . RUDOLPH and SCEPS ? bend over papers under the light . RUDOLPH is in military uniform . RUDOLPH reading a note . " She will escape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your desk ? SCEPS With no envelope , just the sheet of plain note paper . RUDOLPH Every move one makes recorded and transmitted under ground as if by seismograph . But it 's from a friend . It may come from her . We 'll wait till midnight  --  no longer . SCEPS Shall I draw the proclamation ? RUDOLPH It was Napoleon Bonaparte , the runt , who first worked out the formula still used for consolidating conquest . Caesar , before him , cut him a crop of kings , and then went on , more or less bored to discover that new kings sprang up behind him . But the young scrub Napoleon , with a heart like that of a cheap Swiss watch , and the brain of a coffin salesman , set out to sell his wares by getting one foot indoors , and then proclaiming his stuff was free , guaranteed , and a hundred years to pay . He tried it first in Italy , offering liberty , also fraternity , equality gratis , and all they had to do was let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theirs . Our aim is not the same , but the formula 's still good . Our first six words in Hungary to-morrow must be these : We come to set you free . p. 73 SCEPS But is this model apt for your purpose , Highness ? RUDOLPH If it works when it 's but a triok , it should be more effective when we mean to carry it out . We must weld the nation in one day , in one hour . Is policy the peculiar possession of thieves ? SCEPS It 's so considered . But it may be superstition . I 'll try a draft and show it to you . RUDOLPH Make it brief and simple . Brief as a boy 's prayer , simple as its answer . SCEPS I 'll try it . RUDOLPH Yet at the very best , not all will follow us . There are men in Hungary who have no interest in our freedom . Some who 'd rather die than see their revenues reduced three groschen . Some of them will die , no doubt . SCEPS My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You hope this revolution wo n't come down to what the history of revolutions predicts too clearly : a struggle for what 's there on the part of those who want it . That 's my hope , too , And yet I fear that certain men must die if we 're to win . And we must win . LOSCHEK enters LOSCHEK Your Highness . RUDOLPH Yes . p. 74 LOSCHEK The Archduke is here with Count Joseph Hoyos . RUDOLPH Cover these papers . We 'll see him at once . LOSCHEK goes out . SCEPS lays a newspaper over the confusion of maps . JOHN OF TUSCANY comes in with COUNT HOYOS JOHN I beg your pardon , Rudolph , a visitor , if you have a moment 's time . RUDOLPH giving his hand toHOYOSI 'm glad to see you , never more so . HOYOS God and the Archduke John know why I 'm here . We had some talk in a corner , and he told me you were up . That is , the Archduke ; so far God 's said nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken since Moses . HOYOS Well , my lord , I do n't know what 's in the wind . John spoke in riddles , very darkly , of some black inner ring fed up with tyranny . RUDOLPH No doubt there are such groups . I 'm not acquainted with them . JOHN Oh , but Hoyos made an answer . RUDOLPH Yes ? HOYOS I said that my digestion was somewhat impaired by the same diet . So we chatted on still quite obscurely , led from one thing to another , till I found myself led here . p. 75 RUDOLPH This Salvator will swear to a good deal more than he 'll live up to , and nobody minds . He 's not serious . HOYOS I see . We 'll wipe it out . Let 's talk about the hunting . I shall try Mayerling this year . JOHN Good God , I took my soundings ! You can back my word Count Hoyos is as safe a man to talk with as any of us ! RUDOLPH Keep your head , my cousin . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like wise he commands the imperial troops in Vienna . I know him loyal as I am . If you 're meditating treason try somewhere else . HOYOS This is the truth , Prince Rudolph ; there 's been but little said , but it 's enough so that if I were colored all the way through like this imperial uniform , I 'd buzz a bee in the emperor 's ear , but as it is my insides are my own when I take my clothes off and probably much like yours . Whether I 'm with you or not , no man shall hear of you from me , either now or later . We 're mutually aware of a singular danger in frankness . Drop pretense , and I 'll drop it too . RUDOLPH I 've known you a long time . I 'll take your word for bond on any subject . This is a graver matter than you think , not to be entered lightly . HOYOS I 'm grave enough . And I have my grievances , Rudolph . p. 76 RUDOLPH And could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost it . I 'm to lose my command . I might get it back again , from you . RUDOLPH Our plans do n't touch Vienna . HOYOS Aye  --  aye , Buda-Pesth . Yes , I 'd be useless there . That leaves me out . RUDOLPH I thought it would . HOYOS But you have my good wishes , boy . Go on and take it from him , if you can . Only why not make a real revolution of it , go after all or nothing ? RUDOLPH We 're not ready . Hungary 's organized . And add to that , I want no more than comes to me of itself : I make no bid for Austria . HOYOS That 's a pity , because you could certainly have it . RUDOLPH You think so , Hoyos ? HOYOS Hell , I could almost give it to you myself ! Your father has no friends he does n't pay for , and there are installments overdue among some folk I know . LOSCHEK enters LOSCHEK Your Highness was expecting the Baroness Vetsera ? RUDOLPH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . p. 77 RUDOLPH Then at once  --  LOSCHEK Yes , Highness . He goes out . MARY enters RUDOLPH Mary  --  VETSERA Do n't touch me  --  do n't touch me till I 've told you  --  is Koinoff here ? RUDOLPH Not yet . VETSERA Then when he comes put a knife in him ! He 's in the emperor 's pay . and has been all along ! RUDOLPH Koinoff ? JOHN Oh , no . We went to Koinoff first . We picked him out because he was our kind . VETSERA But I know ! I know ! It was n't easy to come and tell you this : do n't question it , and do n't wait ! Whatever 's said to him goes straight to the emperor ! RUDOLPH How have you learned this ? VETSERA From the Baronin von Neustadt . She told me to get you word of that , and remind you that she 'd promised once to be your friend . I could n't send , so I came . Oh , I know it 's true . SCEPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have lied to you . She 's not to be trusted on either side . p. 78 VETSERA Oh , yes , in this  --  she is . RUDOLPH We heard that you were guarded . Have they let you go ? VETSERA I found my way round that . The Duke of Braganza thinks he can trust me now . He 's been somewhat misled .  --  You need never touch me. never , because I can feel his kisses on me , his fat-toad kisses , till I 'll never be clean , never ; oh , all I 'll ask of you is haste , lest you be too late , for he was here , this Koinoff , and heard the plans ! RUDOLPH goes to MARY . She steps backOh , Rudi , Rudi , it 's ended , you and me , too ! RUDOLPH I think not , not you and me , see , thus we wipe it out , whatever it was . He kisses herI 'll take you , and let the world go . I 'll maybe have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balloon to earth , so much rag . It may even mean my days as prince of the blood are over . Gentlemen , we 're warned in time so that if we 're quick about it and clever we may save the firing-squads unnecessary labor . JOHN I doubt the story , the Koinoff story . HOYOS I think the lady 's right . Why were they shipping troops to Hungary this evening ? JOHN Were they ? p. 79 HOYOS Yes , train-loads of them . Nobody knew why . A pause RUDOLPH If you wish to leave , Count Hoyos , we 're not very healthy company . HOYOS No , you 're not . He risesIf that snake Koinoff crawls in while I 'm here I 'm damned with the rest of you . He starts outIn case you find two or three dozen horses would come handy for any purpose , there 's a cavalry stable near the Mall . The doors will be unlocked and no guard set . RUDOLPH Thanks , Hoyos . We may use some of your hags . If any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch the west roads , so  --  we 'd best go south for the winter . For myself , I have an account to settle . I shall wait a few moments more . HOYOS turns away JOHN So shall I. KOINOFF enters through the shadow KOINOFF I give you greeting , gentlemen . HOYOS Koinoff ? KOINOFF Yes , General . It 's Count Hoyos , is it not ? HOYOS Right , right . KOINOFF I 'm unannounced , your Loschek waved me in , as expected . HOYOS returns p. 80 RUDOLPH Come , sit down , we need you , Captain . There 's a road here , look , nobody seems to know . He bends over a map KOINOFF I was not aware Count Hoyos was one of us . HOYOS You sometimes find a red-wing among blackbirds . KOINOFF All the better . Why , this road , we talked of it yesterday . The Baroness Vetsera ! VETSERA Yes . KOINOFF Good Lord , that simplifies our problem . RUDOLPH We pick things up as we go along . KOINOFF Yes , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RUDOLPH It shows on this one map but not on the other three . Are you sure it 's there  --  for we 'll need it ? KOINOFF It 's a military road , built two years ago , and never used for commercial traffic . But it 's there . RUDOLPH You have these things at your finger tips . KOINOFF I 've studied them . RUDOLPH Hungary , too  --  you know it as well as Austria . KOINOFF Yes , sir . RUDOLPH We were speaking of you before you came , Captain Koinoff . There 's no man among us but yourself who knows this maze of forts and arsenals and guns . Count Hoyos is out of it . He 's studied Austria but not the west . The rest of us grew up with polities and statecraft . We shall want a general we can trust , one of ourselves , to lead the Hungarian armies . Would you accept the commission from me ? p. 81 KOINOFF Your Highness , it 's beyond my hope or my desert . RUDOLPH But would you take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except by companies . RUDOLPH But you know tactics and strategy , you 're acquainted with the field . at least the Hungarian border ? KOINOFF Yes . RUDOLPH Would this make up to you for the small weekly stipend you draw from the emperor ? KOINOFF From the emperor ? I ? RUDOLPH You . From the emperor . KOINOFF Surely , Prince Rudolph , you know me better . Tell me who 's whispered this and I 'll refute it . RUDOLPH It was n't whispered , Captain . It 's known . But we 're inclined to say no more about it , since we need you , and your heart 's on our side more than his . An old arrangement , made with Count Taafe for your laundry bills , it happens with lieutenants . They make out perfunctory reports for a week or two , then let it drop . If that was true of you what of it ? It 's gone now . KOINOFF It was never true . Tell me who 's said it ! RUDOLPH It will be evident , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we shall regard you with less confidence if you 're not open with us . I know quite well it 's a usual slip with these cadets . I 've seen their schoolboy writings . Come , man , make confession and get your absolution. p. 82 KOINOFF It was years ago . I 'd almost forgotten it . RUDOLPH That 's more like a man . Then it was true ? KOINOFF Yes . RUDOLPH But you 've broken it off ? You make no more reports ? KOINOFF It was as you said . Your Highness , a schoolboy business . I 'm heartily sorry that it should trouble you now . RUDOLPH Can you explain why troop-trains were departing from Vienna for Hungary this evening ? KOINOFF No , I ca n't . I did n't know it . RUDOLPH Then I 'll tell you why . Because a hybrid snake named Koinoff truckles from one suite to another in this palace conveying news ! Stand away from him ! We shall end this custom of wearing swords among ophidians , at least by one ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Try how you are ! Quick , for we 're short of time ! KOINOFF I wo n't fight with you ! JOHN I 'll cut your throat , you hound ! RUDOLPH Let me deal with him !  --  I have a strain of cruelty in me , and it comes out when I look at vipers . Yes , and on you I 'll turn it loose . Sit on that chair ! And now you 're there let me assure you , sir , you 'll never rise from it . p. 83 VETSERA Rudi ! RUDOLPH Let me alone till I 've disemboweled the rat ! KOINOFF I 'm innocent ! I 'm not to blame ! HOYOS There 's often a use for rats , Rudolph , Do n't waste him . RUDOLPH What experiment would you suggest ? HOYOS Ask him what regiments were left here to guard Vienna . KOINOFF I can tell you ! Whatever you want to know ! RUDOLPH Our adventure 's done ! We have no further use for information concerning guards and troops . HOYOS Our choice lies now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture of Vienna . The latter sounds more likely to succeed . KOINOFF As God 's my judge , there are three regiments left here , and Count Hoyos commands them ! He points at HOYOS RUDOLPH Hoyos ? HOYOS It 's past all doubt I do command three regiments . If that 's what 's left , and it may be , it 's your city , and your kingdom . I make you a present of it . JOHN Take it then . You seem to have some question in your mind . Boy , it 's better than hanging . p. 84 RUDOLPH Perhaps it is . JOHN Perhaps ! Perhaps ! Man , the great wheel goes round  --  and we go up , and the emperor goes down ! Seventeen 's our number , and it shows ! Quick , man , quick like a rat , rake in your fortune before it changes ! SCEPS We have luck at last ! RUDOLPH I 'm sorry they pulled me off . My fingernails are white to the bone with an itch for murder ! I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you when I remember how you came and went and smiled in our faces ! Where was the emperor when you last saw him ? KOINOFF Waiting in his study . RUDOLPH For what ? KOINOFF I 'd promised him a list of names , the Hungarian nobles . RUDOLPH Must I still let him live ? HOYOS These rats are useful . In a war , my God , , there 's nothing like them ! RUDOLPH Then stand up , and put your wrists behind you . Tie them together , someone . If I should touch him he might come apart in my hands , and lose what usefulness a rat may have .  --  And so he 's waiting for a list of our Hungarian friends . We 'll take it to him . He can eat it for supper . p. 85 HOYOS One word first ! How far do we go in this ? It 's safer yet to run if we 're not set to smash the whole way through and come out on the other side ! RUDOLPH What side ? HOYOS Beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave one shred of kingship to him , or influence , he 'll build it up so craftily , we 'll all make mincemeat for him ! RUDOLPH We shall leave him nothing ! The man has one strength only , and that 's to weave his webs around you till he binds you down with one strand after another . Let him weave ! Tonight we pitch his checkerboard in the moat and all the pieces with it ! The game's. over and we start a new one !  --  Pull it up till it cuts  --  we want no slipping !  --  Step on ahead . Yes , you , you with your arms tied  --  KOINOFF goes toward the hall CURTAIN p. 86 Act 2 , Scene 3 SCENE THREE SCENE .  --  TAAFE and FRANZ JOSEPH are sitting in the study over a chessboard . TAAFE moves a piece . FRANZ JOSEPH Mate , then . TAAFE What will you play ? FRANZ JOSEPH Pawn takes knight , sir . TAAFE I had n't seen it . I thought you beaten . FRANZ JOSEPH I was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite dead for sleep . We 'll give our Rudolph a run for it yet . TAAFE It 's midnight , and no news . What shall we do ? FRANZ JOSEPH Wait . THE SERVANT enters THE SERVANT Captain Koinoff 's here , Your Majesty . FRANZ JOSEPH Send him in . THE SERVANT goes out TAAFE I do n't trust Koinoff . He fancies himself . KOINOFF enters , his hands behind him . TAAFE leaps upYour hands , sir ! Why are your hands behind you ? KOINOFF shrugs KOINOFF They 're tied there . p. 87 TAAFE Tied ? KOINOFF Why , look for yourself . I do n't care for the fashion . If you 'll undo them I 'll wear them somewhere else . TAAFE looks out through the curtain TAAFE You 're alone ? KOINOFF Not quite . Prince Rudolph 's on his way . I 'm sent ahead as avaunt courier . FRANZ JOSEPH Sir , explain yourself . Has Rudolph sent you to ask audience ? KOINOFF Yes . FRANZ JOSEPH Then why are your wrists bound ? KOINOFF Sir , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FRANZ JOSEPH Unlace his hands . You will return to Rudolph and say from me his audience is granted . You seem to have bungled your business badly . KOINOFF They knew before I came , and were ready for me . FRANZ JOSEPH They knew ? KOINOFF No doubt of it . Also there 's little use in sending back because he 's coming . And will enter when he likes . And bring whom he pleases . TAAFE There 's a guard in the hall . KOINOFF It 's gone . p. 88 FRANZ JOSEPH roaring . The guard ? KOINOFF Your Majesty , it 's gone . FRANZ JOSEPH See what he means . TAAFE steps out KOINOFF Your Majesty , I 'll offend , whatever I do , but somehow between the time I left them and returned , they 'd learned about me , yet what they sent me here to say I can not and dare not say . FRANZ JOSEPH Deliver your message , sir . KOINOFF I dare not , truly . In this room , where you are most a king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rudolph ? KOINOFF Yes . FRANZ JOSEPH He makes demands ? KOINOFF Yes . FRANZ JOSEPH Are you more afraid of Rudolph than of me ? For if you 're not why do you mention it at all ? The lad has frightened you ! TAAFE returns TAAFE Your Majesty , Prince Rudolph , accompanied by some two or three , is here asking admittance . FRANZ JOSEPH And the guard ? TAAFE The guard may have been changing . But it 's set as usual . I know the men . p. 89 FRANZ JOSEPH The captain exaggerates . Who 's with Rudolph ? TAAFE Herr Sceps , the Archduke John , and Mary Vetsera . FRANZ JOSEPH Vetsera ? The boys are quick ! They 've been birds ' - nosting ! TAAFE Yes . FRANZ JOSEPH I 'll see Prince Rudolph . Not the others . RUDOLPH enters RUDOLPH You were not so delicate when you led an expedition into my rooms and over-ran us with soldiery . FRANZ JOSEPH Come in . You meant it as an affront , the officer you sent me pinioned ? RUDOLPH A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ; you may have him back . He 's of the stuff you like in councillors and statesmen  --  two parts crawling and three parts venom . FRANZ JOSEPH Still , without him , sir , I should have fared but badly . You 'd have got just half my empire . That , if I may presume , should be your first lesson in government . When you 're crowned king , leave scruples at the chancel door with the holy water . If you keep them by you they 'll trip you up . RUDOLPH I 'm not here for instruction . Moreover the demands I made before are altered now . p. 90 FRANZ JOSEPH Suppose we speak in private . TAAFE and KOINOFF go outLooking out over the conflicts of the world I have observed that winners make demands , losers take what they get . You 've made a play for Hungary , and lost . You have in tow the little Vetsera , and no doubt for you that constitutes victory . But you may keep her only at my pleasure . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cockerel has for his first mezzo crowing . RUDOLPH If you look from the outer window , you 'll see men ranked four deep around the palace . No one goes out or in without permission . FRANZ JOSEPH pauses , then goes to the window FRANZ JOSEPH Quite unusual . Tell me , is there some celebration ? FRANZ JOSEPH You have no force in Vienna . RUDOLPH Try to leave . Order your carriage . Call a servant . Ring . You 'll get no answer . FRANZ JOSEPH Count Taafe ! JOHN OF TUSCANY comes to the door JOHN Count Taafe is my prisoner , Your Majesty , but if you wish him  --  TAAFE enters FRANZ JOSEPH Then whose prisoner am I ? p. 91 RUDOLPH Shall we avoid the word ? My terms are simple . Shall I state them to you ? FRANZ JOSEPH You run great jeopardy for a trollop and a farm ! RUDOLPH I 'm not a novice in such scurrility . I could pass it back , but it hardly becomes us . FRANZ JOSEPH You have scooped up brigands among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his garbage , and your own  --  but wait . Wait till this slight disorder is perceived by authorities in the city . Hold the Hofburg against regulars if you can . RUDOLPH Do you recall what general commands in Vienna ? FRANZ JOSEPH More than one . RUDOLPH There 's been a thundering exodus to-night toward Buda-Pesth . Can you have been so blind , with all your policy , as to lock the stable and leave the house doors open ? It 's Count Hoyos commands Vienna . You 've offended him in some major way . FRANZ JOSEPH Where is Count Hoyos ? RUDOLPH Here . But he 's been busy . It was he gave orders to isolate the palace . TAAFE Hoyos too ? FRANZ JOSEPH This may be much more serious for you all than I had guessed . May I look at this rebellion face to face ? p. 92 RUDOLPH Surely . FRANZ JOSEPH Bring them all in . And our little frightened captain , bring him too . I 've something to ask him . RUDOLPH nods to JOHN , who steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one room , and so little mother wit ! JOHN , HOYOS , MARY VETSERA , SCEPS and KOINOFF enterThe good Count Hoyos , Vetsera , the enchanting , the truant Archduke who never sees his Tuscany , Herr Sceps of the trenchant pen , silent in council , Rudolph , the heir apparent . And not among them one to say , when they knock at my door , let the lion sleep , lest he be dangerous still ? I am dangerous , and never more so than now . If you will turn and take your way to your homes through the silent snow as silently as you came , I 'll not remember what faces I saw here , nor once remind you by word or act there was snow on the streets to-night and you left traces in it . HOYOS It 's a little late to say that nothing 's happened . Some of your friends have questioned our activities enough to make a stand against us . Where they stood the snow is somewhat bloody . FRANZ JOSEPH An execution ? HOYOS No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companios on a street corner . p. 93 FRANZ JOSEPH How many dead ? HOYOS That 's not known yet . FRANZ JOSEPH And this was done , Count Hoyos , on your authority ? FRANZ JOSEPH Even that might be hushed up and pardoned . I engage to hush and pardon it if you end it here . Not otherwise . RUDOLPH The victors make the terms ! That was your word ! FRANZ JOSEPH And you are the victors ! RUDOLPH Ring ! Call your people ! I saw a servant lying across the threshold of your hall . It seems he cared more for your safety than his own and got his throat cut . FRANZ JOSEPH So the boy 's dead . One more to be explained . RUDOLPH We explain nothing . We 've taken the city and hold it . FRANZ JOSEPH It 's not a grateful task to brush the dew from such a gleaming dawn , but you 're misinformed about the forces in our capital . There 's a reserve of more than twice your numbers , Count Hoyos , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the streets and cut your lines outside . You 'll reign but briefly . Count Taafe , testify to this. , TAAFE to RUDOLPH . Your Highness , I have been hoping you 'd withdraw your men before you 're crushed here . It 's inevitable if you wait longer . p. 94 FRANZ JOSEPH Perhaps you do n't quite trust the word of the captain here , and yet he 's expert in all these matters . He can state exactly what regiments are stationed in the city for emergencies . KOINOFF They 're lying ! They 're both lying ! There are no troops at the arsenal ! FRANZ JOSEPH Koinoff ! Koinoff ! The weathervano should make certain of the wind before it whirls . KOINOFF But that 's the truth , Prince Rudolph , there 's no guard there . FRANZ JOSEPH Do you remember , Taafe , I said there was something overlooked ? Even so . It was Count Hoyos who had slipped my mind when we stripped Vienna down . And so we 've lost . At least we 've lost this hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Much against my will and judgment , choose out your village farm and dangle your lady with you . You 'll rue it , and so will I , but take the disease with the cure . RUDOLPH It was my plan to take only Hungary , leave you Austria , but now you 've pushed your stakes across the table and thrown your dice and lost , I win them both , and keep them both . FRANZ JOSEPH Both ? Not only a farm , but Hungary  --  and not only Hungary , now , but Austria , too . RUDOLPH Yes . p. 95 FRANZ JOSEPH Come . I 'm to abdicate ? RUDOLPH It 's necessary  --  in cases of this sort . FRANZ JOSEPH You 've studied them ? RUDOLPH I have . FRANZ JOSEPH You hold a palace , and one old man in his room . Outside the empire sleeps peacefully , but when it wakes and asks what has been done with the emperor , you 'll have no ready answer . RUDOLPH Tell me then what answer you made when in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore it ? What 's been done before can be done again . FRANZ JOSEPH Boy , you 'd be followed only by those who stand to gain by you ! The gifts you give to some you must take away from others ! Could you ride a civil war ? RUDOLPH Sir , by all rules of immemorial Austrian intrigue you would have the better of me . But the earth goes steadily round the sun , and men and customs die out or change . Shut here in your darkened room you 've seen all Europe as one static night inhabited by spiders that sit still mending their webs , eating their flies , and watching each lest another spring . But , could you see , you have not stayed the wheeling of the stars nor held the tide piled on one longitude by bandaging your eyes . Were I not here , were there no men about your palace , still your sun went down the Simplon twenty years before to-night . What you came offering when you were crowned , men want no longer . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RUDOLPH If I offer now what a new day demands , they 'll come to me , and the old dog 's forgotten . It 's no pleasure to say this to my father , but it seems that in these matters sentiment 's not used . You taught me that . FRANZ JOSEPH turns away for a moment , then comes back FRANZ JOSEPH It might be done . If you turned orator , and spread the butter thick where the logic 's thin and acted swiftly , and somewhat brutally while the spell was on them , you could sew them up before they caught their breath . But it 's not your way , my Rudolph . No , you 'd mean it while you said it , and trust in righteousness to bring you through and they 'd have you by the throat . RUDOLPH I 'd mean it all . FRANZ JOSEPH No doubt . But when an actor plays a part he 's much more moving to the audience if he 's not taken in by what he 's doing enough to weep real tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RUDOLPH Sir , you may hear my creed . There 's been no king , since the halfmythical figures of medieval times , who took for his motto : Nothing for myself . But I shall take it . I 'm tired of having . Let me drink plain water and eat plain food , and turn what mind I have to an instrument of justice , clean of greed , despising politics . The first steps we take may seem arbitrary or tyrannous , but when we 're once entrenched we 'll lighten all oppression from above , and let the garden grow , for it will ! p. 97 FRANZ JOSEPH Suppose I abdicate . What is your first step , being king ? RUDOLPH To remove political restrictions . FRANZ JOSEPH Oh , but first , I know , say two or three hundred men in Hungary , say three or four hundred men in Austria , who must die if you 'd be king . Oh , yes , they must . And I 'm among them . RUDOLPH I 'd think there were not so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no  --  they 're like the little servant who was killed outside . While they 're alive they 'll fight , and they 'll have friends . Koinoff will live , the snakes will shed their skins , but those who ca n't crawl must die  --  that 's absolute , if you 're to last ten days . RUDOLPH Very well . Let them die . FRANZ JOSEPH Yes , a few  --  you 'll say  --  men nobody wants , but for your real antagonists , the men with power and will and courage , you 'll respect them and let them live , because your heart 's too soft for more than a moderate slaughter . And being alive , and having no inhibitions of your sort , they 'll rip you up . RUDOLPH And since that must be prevented I 'll be thorough . FRANZ JOSEPH I beg your pardon ? p. 98 RUDOLPH Sir , interpret it as you please . I shall be thorough . SCEPS This is a strange beginning , Rudolph ! JOHN Yes , but logical . There 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way  --  RUDOLPH It 's the road we 've taken and ca n't retrace  --  SCEPS Yet we 'll have much the look of the French guillotine that came , my lord , to set men free ! HOYOS When men make revolutions they put their enemies to death or die . That 's beyond argument . RUDOLPH Little as we like it some few must die . SCEPS I do n't go with you in it ! Moreover , in matters serious as this you owe it to us all to ask our word before you make decisions ! RUDOLPH I shall ask your word , later on , but at the moment this is a military action . One strong hand must guide it . SCEPS If you begin , Prince Rudolph , with these wholesale proseriptions , my tongue and pen are useless to you . I 'm no facile journalist . What I believe I 'll write and publish . These are murderous tactics , unnecessary to the establishment of authority . p. 99 RUDOLPH You 'll no longer coperate with us ? SCEPS No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till we give you leave . SCEPS You 'll establish censorship ? You ? RUDOLPH Until it 's clear who governs  --  till we 're quite past being shaken we dare brook no opposition . SCEPS Dare not ! Dare not ! RUDOLPH You heard my order ! This is no moment for a descent of doves and apocalyptio revelations ! Take your place among us or leave ! SCEPS is silent FRANZ JOSEPH Your reign begins to shake off dreams , and may in time emerge as the age of iron . We agree on my demise . And what will you do next ? RUDOLPH With Your Majesty 's pardon our time grows short , and we have much to do . I can give you no more answers . FRANZ JOSEPH To put it plainly you wish to see this remnant of a monarch encased behind stone walls ? RUDOLPH Of necessity . And further speech is useless . In this hour I 'm responsible to myself alone . FRANZ JOSEPH It 's best when you 're in company to make pretense that there 's a God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , I take your time . If I might put one question more I 'll swear to eternal silence . p. 100 RUDOLPH What is it ? FRANZ JOSEPH When you 've killed these seven hundred men , and they 've been ushered solemnly under ground , what disposition 's planned for their property ? Will it be given to friends of yours ? RUDOLPH Sir , not to my enemies . FRANZ JOSEPH Why , fairly answered . Count Taafe , stand erect . We 've had the watching of many gallant gentlemen who passed this doorway for the last time . Our admiration went with those few who took it in a stride and laughed as they went out . I say good night , adding , with the fine old piety of kings , a hope that we meet in heaven . RUDOLPH Good night . TAAFE Good night . HOYOS Shall I call a guard ? RUDOLPH Yes . Take the emperor and Taafe in your keeping . As for Koinoff have him shot when convenient . KOINOFF Your Majesty ! RUDOLPH I want no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come first ! Let it stand as omen over what follows ! FRANZ JOSEPH In your place I 'd keep him , but that 's a minor matter . Before I go may I congratulate your cabinet on the accession of an emperor who 'll give my reign , in retrospect , the air of a golden age , in which the headsman 's axe fell as light punctuation . p. 101 JOHN Why do you say so ? FRANZ JOSEPH When you grind my friends for fertilizer , and plant your friends in their dust I know your history . FRANZ JOSEPH and TAAFE step toward the doorNow may I ask one final favor ? RUDOLPH Yes . FRANZ JOSEPH When the good Count Hoyos finds me a cell , will he see that this cell 's furnished with pen and ink and paper , paper enough to hold seven hundred names ? It just so happens that I , of all men living , can tell best the names of my fast friends . For a legacy I 'll leave the list to you . RUDOLPH Leave it if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOSEPH It will be full and accurate . One name will be omitted , that of Count Taafe here , because there are , say , ten or a dozen matters he can inform you of , unfinished business that carries over . What you may do with him or with his information , when you have it , that of course rests with you . Will you mind , Count Taafe , if we leave you delegate among the living from the kingdoms of the dead ? TAAFE At Your Majesty 's service . RUDOLPH And for your information let me state that no unfinished business carries over from your regime to mine . I want no links that tie us in with your machinery for the exploitation of underlings . No doubt you leave ten thousand questions at loose ends , matters of foreign correspondence , matters of internal discipline , taxes , legislation to stop fresh gaps in the walls where liberty begins to wear through stone . But all these questions will go unanswered till we get to them and answer them in our own way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . p. 102 FRANZ JOSEPH You could trust him . I am myself too dangerous a chattel to keep about , but Taafe knows as much as I , and will serve you quite as well RUDOLPH Have you failed to hear me ? What in God 's name is Taafe to you that you should plead for him ? FRANZ JOSEPH Lad , nothing , nothing . I do n't ask this for Taafe , but for you ! RUDOLPH And I do n't want him , wo n't have him at any price  --  want none of your retinue , nor plans nor fragments left over from your ruins ! FRANZ JOSEPH almost to himself . It may be wise . It may be the way to win them . Yet at first you 'll go so far astray . Well , let it go , Taafe comes with me . RUDOLPH Why this is kind of you . I thank you both . FRANZ JOSEPH You 'll think I delay for a purpose , but one more word . A revolution 's won or lost on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and your people depend on the press entirely . Before one word sifts out on your revolution , the journalists of both the capitals must be informed firmly of what to print . A censorship 's inevitable . Herr Sceps is an indication of what you must expect . RUDOLPH Must I say again that nothing you have ever said or done is necessary as a precedent to what we have to do ? You came to enslave ! We come to set men free ! p. 103 HOYOS But if you 're worried about the censorship , we thought of that . The papers have been silenced . That was my job , and I saw to it first . FRANZ JOSEPH You 've seen to it ! I see . You have two hands ; with one you set men free , with one you shut them up . That 's as it should be . That 's as it always is . RUDOLPH Does your catechism draw to a close , or will you indulge us further with reminiscences of triumphs over the people you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though only one . The Princess Stephanie is still your wife . If you should break with her you will get tardy recognition from the powers of Europe ; your support at home will be confused . Temper your blood awhile ; postpone your union with Vetsera , or your kingship 's mortally wounded . RUDOLPH I 'm aware of your feeling on that question . We 'd not be here tonight if the tempering of my blood had lain in your imperial hands . He turns to MARY FRANZ JOSEPH You turn for solace to a rather doubtful bosom  --  I know this lady better than you  --  RUDOLPH Damn you , will you bring this maundering to an end ? why all this kindly interest in me ? Why , to poison what I 'm to do , with your last breath infect us with your leprosy ! Take them out ! Let it end ! I 've listened too long ! He turns his back and walks away . A pause . TAAFE steps toward the door . KOINOFF , a dagger in his hand , leaps across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rudolph ! He throws himself between KOINOFF and RUDOLPH and is hurled to the floor . HOYOS and the ARCHDUKE JOHN pinion KOINOFF 'S arms and his knife falls . RUDOLPH bends over FRANZ JOSEPH , helping him as he gets to his feet slowly KOINOFF to FRANZ JOSEPH . Why did you stop me ? Do you want to die ? FRANZ JOSEPH You mistake me , sir ! Was I too quick for you ? It 's not for nothing I 've learned to watch men 's eyes ! These weathercocks blow east and west . RUDOLPH Why do you risk your life to save mine ? FRANZ JOSEPH Why , because you 've forty years of life in you , and I have ten or twelve  --  and we 're alike . I shall have no other son , but you may breed a dozen Habsburgs yet to send the name on . RUDOLPH Sir , have you joined my rebellion against yourself ? FRANZ JOSEPH Why , lad , I 've won ! I 've won ! What I want most is to leave a king behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted this ? You played for it ? FRANZ JOSEPH How often what we 've wanted comes to us in the night , a little early , too unexpected , and we put it by , and it never comes again . I take my way quite happily into what darkness you prescribe , my son , knowing now I leave behind a king after my heart , a better than myself , but a king , and a Habsburg king ! He will chew on iron who tries to eat you , now that your salad days are over . When you speak you speak the words of Wittelsbachs and fools , but when you act then you 're my son , and the long quarrel in your blood between the empress and myself , the quarrel that lay in your conceiving , it 's now ended , and I shall win , by dying . p. 105 RUDOLPH I shall not rule as you have . FRANZ JOSEPH You 'll try reforms , and then you 'll learn that all reforms are counters in the game of government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management . I tried it too , and found it useful . We have said good night  --  the guard is ready , you have things in hand , and I 'm sorry to have kept you . Before you sleep look in that little black book on your desk  --  and read three words of it . I think you 'll find it 's worth your time . The prisoners are taken out , KOINOFF between HOYOS and JOHN . MARY and RUDOLPH are left together RUDOLPH I am the thing I hate ! Among us all we 've made of me the thing I shall hate most till I die . The thing I do , caught on this bayonet of time , and driven , repeats in word for word and death for death , his coronation . VETSERA Once I heard you say a king might be a man , but a man with power to make men free . RUDOLPH I 've come to this point in anger , but standing here , looking out on what 's behind and what 's before , I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not reach or hold power over men , that he who thinks of power must whip his justice and his mercy close to heel . My anger brought me here and ruthlessness will hold me where I am and those who are my friends are gainers by it but nothing 's changed . I knew this as a child knows what 's in books , as words , and I believed that by some ardent miracle of the mind I 'd give my own mind wings . But what was anger I must now keep , and make a code , and live by . or be torn down . p. 106 VETSERA One moment since you said it , let the garden grow . RUDOLPH I said it . But in this light , this blinding light that beats on you and me now as we stand here , robbing those who have of what they robbed from others , tell me what rule , what guide , what standards , human or divine , can possibly direct a man or king toward justice ? Is it just that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not gained justly . The titles to possession all run back to brigandage and murder . What men own is theirs because they have it , remains theirs while they can keep it . There 's no other proof of any man 's deserving . I set up my title now on murder , as my father set his up long ago . And I take over an old concern , maintained by fraud and force for traffic in corruption . The rest is perfume . A government 's business is to guard the trough for those whose feet are in it . VETSERA How can you know this ? RUDOLPH I have been taken up on a crest of time and shown the kingdoms of the world , those past , those present , those to come , and one and all , ruled in whatever fashion , king or franchise , dictatorship or bureaucrats , they 're run by an inner ring , for profit . It 's bleak doctrine , it 's what the old men told us in our youth , but it 's savagely true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered this room , and knew I owned it and knew I 'd touched Franz Joseph 's power , then virtue went out of me to him ; I was not the same , and any man who sits here in his place will be as he was , as I am . He sits at the table , placing his hand on the notebook . MARY comes forward and lays her hand over hisLet the man live . Let the old man live . p. 107 VETSERA Do n't read it . RUDOLPH No . I wo n't read it I wo n't need it now . I know what I have to do . VETSERA Not for that reason . You 'd know the writing . RUDOLPH Yes ? VETSERA Because it 's mine . RUDOLPH What 's written in it ? VETSERA It 's a diary , Of where we went , and what we did , at first , when I first knew you . RUDOLPH How does it come here , Mary ? VETSERA I was a little fool , and I had seen you somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all worship you , perhaps , not thinking , just whispering to each other in the night about the Crown Prince Rudolph . Then one day the Baronin von Neustadt took me aside to say she could arrange a meeting . All she asked was that I keep a record of my day , and where we went  --  RUDOLPH These are reports to him ? MARY . Yes . RUDOLPH This is how you came to know me ? VETSERA Yes . Only at first  --  RUDOLPH I think I might forgive anything else you 'd done , but to think of you along with Koinoff ! Did you know Koinoff ? p. 108 VETSERA No . I warned you when I knew . Oh , Rudolph , please , it 's nothing . There 's nothing here you could n't see if you wish to read them . And when I loved you , then I sent no more . You can believe it , truly , knowing how much I love you . RUDOLPH I do believe you . And I have loved you , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your arms . They 're the love she brings you . They 're your love for her . You hear them in the music , taste them in the drink . It seeps and rains and drizzles Koinoffs . I think I must have loved you more than I knew . More than I knew . HOYOS and JOHN renterThere was little enough left walking on this earth to hold a man from spitting ! That 's gone now ! This was to be my lover and my queen , and he sent her to me , to sleep with me and tell ! Even that was his ! Let him keep it ! Let him have his earth where men must crawl and women must crawl beneath them and all their words are lies ! I 'm sick of it , sick , and sick to my death !  --  Hoyos , the guard that 's round the palace  --  send them all home to bed . Our revolution 's over . HOYOS Yours may be , not mine . I have no wish to send myself the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I 'm not through . RUDOLPH Take it . You 're next in line . Take Austria and welcome . p. 109 JOHN Will you let us die like so many bitch 's pups ? RUDOLPH Why , who are we that we should n't die ? Have we more reason to live than our seven hundred ? But you wo n't die , you 'll fix it or get away . HOYOS Is this definite ? RUDOLPH Quite definite and final . But you 'll live . And Koinoff , he 'll live , too . It 's an ill wind that brings nobody salvage . Make your arrangements , Hoyos , and cross the border . It 's snowing still , and the blood we shed 's been covered . The little groom that fell on my father 's threshold , see that he 's removed , so folks wo n't stumble when they enter and raise an outcry . I think you said the shooting 's good at Mayerling . I shall try it . If you want me , look for me there . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . He turns away VETSERA Am I to stay ? RUDOLPH You 'd better go with Hoyos . Take care of her for my sake , Hoyos . Look that she 's safe away . He starts out the doorThe devil take these dead men . I shall see his eyes forever . VETSERA Rudolph ! RUDOLPH goes out@@ SCENE .  --  RUDOLPH 'S apartment in the shooting lodge at Mayerling . The room is plainly furnished , containing little more than a writing table , a gunrack and a number of chairs . There is a fireplace at the rear , also a door to the bedroom ; the entrance to the hall is at the right . At the left two curtained windows . It is dawn of the next day , just beginning to lighten toward sunrise . Three shots are heard in the distance , at varying intervals , then two more , as if a covey of birds had been flushed . There is a tap at the hall door , a pause , and LOSCHEK enters . He pauses , looking at the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes out in a dressing gown , a packet of letters in his handYou wished me to call you at dawn , Your Highness . RUDOLPH Yes . It 's dawn already ? LOSCHEK Nearly six . RUDOLPH Is Hoyos about ? LOSCHEK I think he 's shooting in the lower copse with the others . They went out at five . RUDOLPH Yes . I heard them banging . There 's nothing like firearms to amuse a soldier . I 've been writing letters , Loschek. p. 111 LOSCHEK Yes , Your Highness . RUDOLPH I have addressed them in my own tangled chirography , but you 've had experience with it , and I trust them to you . LOSCHEK Yes , Highness . He takes the letters RUDOLPH Also I think your face is my earliest memory , Loschek , except perhaps for my mother 's . You 'll say your face is nothing much to remember , I know  --  LOSCHEK Yes , Your Highness  --  RUDOLPH But the point is you 've never failed me in any commission  --  nor in anything whatever  --  except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  LOSCHEK Oh , sir  --  RUDOLPH Thereby lengthening my life toward some highly dubious conclusion . Which conclusion , if it should be sudden , I have anticipated by penning certain laborious notes to my friends . You will keep them for me , and you will keep them where nobody will find them unless  --  and until . You understand me ? LOSCHEK Too well , Your Highness . RUDOLPH Oh , but there 's nothing immediate , nothing in the least immediate . Only the news has reached me that we all die sometime . Azrael , the angel of death , came to me in the night and told me I bore a resemblance to my father . I felt a feather fall from his wing , and where it touched my temple the hair was gray this morning . As they say in the Old Testament , Selah.  --  When we know that we 're to die what 's the difference whether we 're dead or not , Loschek ? p. 112 LOSCHEK The greatest difference in the world , my lord . RUDOLPH And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know yet what future my dear father plans for me , if any . I await his pleasure . Nobody knows what may go on at the back of the old man 's mind . Hence the premonitions . Let me see Count Hoyos when he 's finished with the partridges . LOSCHEK Yes , Highness . He goes outt . There are a few scattering shots from the copse and RUDOLPH goes to a window . MARY VETSERA opens the rear door and enters in a nightgown . She pauses a moment , then speaks softly VETSERA Rudi . RUDOLPH Yes . VETSERA I was half awake , and reached for you with my arm , but you were gone ; then suddenly I felt such deadly terror  --  I 'd have died of it if I had n't found you . RUDOLPH Or gone back to sleep and waked to ask for breakfast . VETSERA Rudi , please do n't mock me  --  my blood 's cold with it  --  as if the author of the experiment put out a hand and took the sun  --  and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a dream . One ca n't tell dreams . RUDOLPH You tell them very well  --  you do everything well  --  perfect , finished , adept , accomplished  --  that 's the woman of it ; God knows where they learn p. 113 VETSERA Is it dawn on the windows ? RUDOLPH Yes . VETSERA The sun 's not gone then . But it 's cold as if it would never be warm . RUDOLPH Go back to bed . I 'll have them light a fire . VETSERA Whose lover were you  --  last night when you loved me ? RUDOLPH I can pay . He holds out his hand with coins in itNo doubt you 'll recognize the sum . It 's usual here in Vienna . VETSERA Is this the wage they set for prostitutes ? RUDOLPH You recognize it ? VETSERA No , but I 've heard , I think . RUDOLPH I 've heard men say it was little for a woman 's soul in the night . It seems her soul 's worth more then than by day . For scrutinize it under broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Take the money . VETSERA You want to hurt me ? RUDOLPH These little hurts ! They 're fiction , like your souls , and they wash out like rain . With a new dress they 're half-healed  --  add half a dram of starlight , three kisses and a ring , and they 're gone clean better not spoken of p. 114 VETSERA What have I done ? RUDOLPH Women are realists , my dearest dear , loving the sun like flowers , but if one sun goes headlong down the sky , with Phaethon , they weep a little under dewy lids and wait for the next sun 's rising . I 've gone down and you will weep your most becomingly and swear it 's the end , the last , and so it is until the next sunrise . VETSERA Why should you hurt me ? Is it because you hate the whole earth so much you want to hate me too ? RUDOLPH If you 'll go stop three tradesmen on the street , and ask the three what it is they live by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink , and they 'll be certain of it ; victuals and drink , like the rhyme in Mother Goose makes up their diet ; nothing will be said of faith in things unseen , or following tho gleam , just bread and meat and a can of wine to wash it down . But if you know them well behind the fish-eyes and the bellies , if you know them better than they do , each one burns candles at some altar of his mind in secret ; secret from himself each is a priest to some dim mystery by which he lives . Strip him of that , and bread and meat and wine wo n't nourish him . Fish-eyed , pot-bellied , standing over counters , still without his chuckle-headed hidden faith he dies and goes to dust . The faith I had was baseless as a palace of the winds anchored in cloud , a faith that I had found a use for kings , a faith that with skill and wisdom and infinite tolerance , infinite patience , I , the heir of all the Habsburgs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut new dies for the mind and lift men by their bootstraps till they walked the upper air . This is the faith of fools , but I had it , and I lost it . One by one the holds I counted on to take us up turned out to be the ancient clanking irons that bind men to the rock . Till one by one I could trust no one  --  could not trust myself , and stretched out blindly at the end to rest on a love I had  --  a woman 's love  --  not much to ask when your world comes down about your ears after your faith . And then I saw it there , a little , dirty , calculating love , smelling of stale champagne and cigarettes and girls ' - school lushing . Fit to go to bed with , and offer coins for . p. 115 VETSERA I know it . I said it once . And now you see me as I see myself , a baggage , the sort that might have sold you flowers or cleaned your rooms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thirty girls in line , you rode with your princess , down the Prater  --  and we looked and gasped and worshipped . That 's when I saw you first , among these females in the egg , adoring their king of men . I loved you after that , even when I had a nasty small affair with the officer , that , too , was in your world , and I was almost proud . I know it 's silly to be young , to be love-sick , to make a portrait-shrine of someone far-off , above you ; but to have the sudden offer of a meeting with him if only you 'll bring word of where he goes , and then to find that he 's incongruously in love with you , as you with him , to know that you 're a little fool , no more , no more , and one of the great masters of the world , the highest , wisest , godliest , looks down and loves this empty face of yours  --  oh , Rudi , I could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Then I took my soul between my hands , and said , if this is his it must be worthy of him ; watched your ways and listened when you spoke , and loved , and listened till I knew better than you knew yourself what your dreams were ; yes , till it sometimes seemed that something nobler grew here in my breast than the heart of a gypsy 's daughter . Words came to me to say what I had never thought nor said , and pride came , and reserve . But these are yours , not mine , for I was moulded in the womb after a slighter pattern . Made for dancing or for light loves . And now you look on me and see it . What was yours you take away and what you leave of me will dance again because that 's all it knows , but not be happy because it loved you once . p. 116 RUDOLPH Why were you here last night ? VETSERA Was it wrong ? I 've nothing that 's my own . I followed you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why did you let me in if I was n't wanted ?  --  But it was wrong . I know ; I come between you and your father . Once I 'm gone he 'll take you back . Rudi , I swear I did n't think of it . RUDOLPH Think of this then , my dear ; my date 's run out ; I 'm no more king of men than Loschek . I 've a pocketful of silver , and certain braid on my coat , and a name I hate , and a strong inclination toward the dark like a cur dying . It 's a woman 's place to fix her to some bastard that goes up and set her heel on faces that go down as mine is going . All the rest is words , the weeping interim , the sweet despair before you dance again . VETSERA I 'll go if it helps you . I 'll try never to see you . RUDOLPH Try ? Oh , child , look in your heart . Your hands still cling to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human , while you cling , your mind 's alive with ciroling wings searching this way and that  --  one man who smiled , one man who asked you boldly for a night , ten men who came a-wooing  --  of them all which of them all shall make his bed with me when Rudolph 's gone ? The treacherous , savage mind knows better than our words . And I know this because my mind 's more savage than your own , filthy , desperate , faithless , hopeless of faith in men or women or myself . p. 117 VETSERA Is there no way I could still see you , any creeping way , so low the emperor would never know that I was there ? If I could be your dog , even your dog  --  RUDOLPH You 're shivering . It 's cold here . We must have a fire . He lights the fire in the grate VETSERA I read a story once about how all men vanished from the earth after some pestilence , and a race of dogs grew up where men are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked upright , built fires , and knew all things , and gave commands and still lived , but invisible . I think when I have lost you I 'll remember you as the dogs remembered man . RUDOLPH For the fires I build ? VETSERA No . One must have a god . Was I faithless . Rudi ? Why did I speak when you 'd have had an empire , and warn you not to take it ? RUDOLPH Because you knew you 'd lose me if I were emperor . VETSERA Would I have lost you ? RUDOLPH Yes . VETSERA Yes , I would . And that was selfish , too . Either way I must lose you . Very well . I lose you either way . What will you do ? Where will you go ? RUDOLPH is silent You 'll be crown prince again . Go back to your father . p. 118 RUDOLPH Yes . It 's all one now which way I go . VETSERA Yes . Surely . You 'll be forgiven if you give me up , but with me you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too chivalrous to say it out , but that 's the way it 's left us . RUDOLPH As for you the world 's young yet . If you should never see me , is n't it true , another love comes by and whistles at your window , and it 's spring , and the great wound you thought would never heal leaves not a scar in time  --  ? oh , a few months or years and all the paths that led to grief are stopped with green-briar , overgrown and lost , past finding when we hunt for them . VETSERA Why , yes , oh , yes . I shall not like the thing I 'll be when that has happened . RUDOLPH When it 's happened , then we think no more about it . VETSERA Yes , but now I 'd rather be a statue to my love , a statue in a forest , lost and unseen , cold , too , and white , and hardly once remembered , but changeless just the same . Oh , but I 'll go ! When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart stops . A couple of random shots are heard from the woods RUDOLPH Hearts are durable ; they wear out all the rest . You 're still trembling . Come near the fire . p. 119 VETSERA No , I 'll go back to bed . I think I 'm tired . RUDOLPH Forgive me ? VETSERA As a dog forgives his god , see , I forgive you wholly , and worship what you do . Only forgive me if I should never change . She kisses him RUDOLPH Yes . Rest well . VETSERA I 'm happier now , and I 'll rest . She goes into the bedroom and closes the door . There is a tap at the hall entrance and LOSCHEK looks in LOSCHEK Count Hoyos , Highness . RUDOLPH Let him in . LOSCHEK withdraws and HOYOS enters HOYOS Greetings , Your Highness . RUDOLPH It seems you never sleep . HOYOS I have n't your inducements . I hear you sent for me , but I was coming with a bit of news . A coach just topped the rise bearing the royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early visitors . RUDOLPH You saw it ? HOYOS On the other side of the gates . He should be here by this time . RUDOLPH It 's the emperor . p. 120 HOYOS No doubt It struck me you 'd do well to wash your face and hide your woman . RUDOLPH How do you stand with him ? HOYOS Well , as I said , he put us outt like lightning , gave us our pardons with the back of his hand and combed his whiskers . I was out of favor  --  I 'm still out , that 's all . A single muffled shot is heard RUDOLPH Why is he coming ? HOYOS Oh , just to get you back . Put in a word for your humble servant . RUDOLPH I will . That 's what I sent to tell you now . HOYOS You 'll kiss and make up ? RUDOLPH Why not ? Between the black wolf 's jaw and the lamb 's hind-quarters I 'd rather play the wolf . HOYOS That 's sensible . RUDOLPH I was born half wolf , half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HOYOS If it 's that way with you make your terms , man . RUDOLPH Terms ? When wolf eats lamb that 's terms  --  and peace . Wait for me . He goes into the bedroom . HOYOS walks to the fire . After a moment RUDOLPH comes out with a small revolver in his handHoyos. p. 121 HOYOS Yes ? RUDOLPH shows the revolver . HOYOS goes into the bedroom . RUDOLPH sits unsteadily . HOYOS returnsWhen did it happen ? RUDOLPH This moment . She was here . HOYOS I must tell the emperor . RUDOLPH No ! Tell no one ! Their damned kites will take her from me ! HOYOS What will you do ? RUDOLPH I'do n't know yet . Keep them away .  --  She 's dead ? HOYOS She died instantly . RUDOLPH I ca n't believe it . Hoyos , she was here , before you came . HOYOS I must tell some story . Quick , what is it ? RUDOLPH Keep them out . Let them leave me alone . She wanted to be changeless . I heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king the Crown Prince Rudolph came to Mayerling to seek seclusion . Hold them off with that and tell them nothing . HOYOS Lad , I know it 's awkward to see a pretty woman that you 've known with a bullet through her head . But do n't let that mislead you . It 's an embarrassment the loss once you 've run dry of tears . Suppose we 're quiet till I can smuggle her quietly underground . Then if she 's travelling in Italy or Turkestan and never does come back at least she 's gone . p. 122 RUDOLPH Damn you , what do you mean ? HOYOS Only that we say nothing . You yourself suggested it . RUDOLPH Then do as I suggest , and leave me with her . HOYOS goes toward the door . As he approaches it there is a knock and he opens to LOSCHEK HOYOS Who is it ? LOSCHEK The empress , sir . She asks me to tell Rudolph that she begs on her Knees to see him . RUDOLPH Why should she beg of me ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after a moment the EMPRESS ELIZABETH enters ELIZABETH What is it , Rudolph ? What 's in your face ? She goes across and kneels beside him RUDOLPH The black jaw 's at the flock , that 's all . ELIZABETH What is it , Hoyos ? HOYOS We 've both been rebels ; maybe we 're sorry for it . ELIZABETH It 's something more . As if you 'd watched a pageant cross the night with horror at the end . RUDOLPH Oh , mother , mother , so many , many times , I needed you when I was a child , but you were never there , and now we 're strangers . p. 123 ELIZABETH They kept me from you ! RUDOLPH Yes . And now we 're strangers . What you 'd have me do  --  all that was worth the saving in me , that was you , and I 've betrayed it . ELIZABETH But all we 've lost , all the lost years , we 'll have them now . Look , Rudolph , your father 's with me . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because his child despises what he does . Come back to him . I 've been against him always , as you have , but we 've grown old together , and his son means more to him than kingdoms . He 's forgotten whatever it was that happened , forgives it , pardons all that took part , asks nothing , only to have his man-child back again . RUDOLPH Yes  --  as before . ELIZABETH Will you see him ? RUDOLPH Yes . ELIZABETH He 's waiting , Hoyos . HOYOS Yes , madam . He goes out ELIZABETH You have n't slept . RUDOLPH No . ELIZABETH It 's quite useless , Rudolph , to fight against what we are . It 's broken me . It will break you too . RUDOLPH You have gone over to them . p. 124 ELIZABETH Only to help you . There is a short pause , then FRANZ JOSEPH enters . They rise FRANZ JOSEPH Lest you should think I deal in crocodile promises , Rudolph , I have here three long state papers , drawn in a sleepless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pardon for your friends and you , another 's a commission left blank that you may choose what place you 'll take in the Austrian government  --  and this , the third , will place you on the throne of Hungary three years from now , even if I live so long and you 're not there before . I offer these as humbly as I can . Lose you I can not . Let you go I can not . If I 've been too politic , too stern , forgive me , Rudolph , I went to a bitter school . RUDOLPH What else ? FRANZ JOSEPH I hold to one condition only . The Vetsera 's a light , designing woman , bought and sold , loving by instinct where she lies , but quick in trade , like the trader 's daughter that she is , where a kiss will mean advantage . She 's no queen for you . The mirror on her wall has kept as full a record as her heart of those she 'll reach her arms out for . RUDOLPH I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never change after this morning FRANZ JOSEPH You believed her ? p. 125 RUDOLPH Yes ELIZABETH There should be something regal in a queen , Rudolph ; she 's small and cheap . RUDOLPH But she 'll not change , after this morning . A statue in a wood runs more in the rain , yields more to the frost , than she in this last mood . ELIZABETH Is she here ? RUDOLPH Yes . ELIZABETH May I see her ? RUDOLPH Mary ! Mary Vetsera ! There is a pause ELIZABETH She 's asleep ? RUDOLPH Yes . ELIZABETH Shall I wake her ? RUDOLPH Wake her if you can . ELIZABETH What is it , Rudolph ? She looks at RUDOLPH 'S face , then crosses to the bedroom and enters . Returning , she leans heavily against the door-jamb , her eyes fixed on RUDOLPH then on the EMPEROR FRANZ JOSEPH I understand . He walks to the door , looks through it briefly , then turns to ELIZABETHIt will be necessary to conceal our visit here . Hoyos will bring us word of what has happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 126 RUDOLPH I shall stay here to make the necessary arrangements . FRANZ JOSEPH It must not be known that you were with her . Nothing in the world could clear your name of scandal , or suppress the story if you remain . RUDOLPH She 's quite immune to scandal now , and I shall not greatly mind what 's said of me . ELIZABETH Rudolph , Rudolph , it 's your name , your name before the people ! Say you loved her , still nothing you do or say can hurt her now , and you have a life to live ! RUDOLPH If I go back this morning , and leave her lying in this room alone , then hour by hour you 'll win me from her , and in the end it will be my hand that guides all Europe down to hell . I know myself and what you 'll want of me , and what I am , and my black destination . But I 've learned from the little peddler 's daughter , the Vetsera , how to keep faith with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FRANZ JOSEPH For the love of God ! RUDOLPH You have no God , nor I ! When a man lies down to sleep , he sleeps ! ELIZABETH My child , my child , do n't think it ! It tears my heart ! RUDOLPH My mother was a rebel , and she used all her beauty and her brain to check the darkening evil of a house that thrives and grows by evil . She 's here now , an angel still , but fallen , holding out to me the bloody symbols of the trade by which we 've lived too long . And if I live I 'll wear them , as she wears them , till my mind 's a charnel house , and men remember me as the broath of postilence ! I had thought , indeed , of going back with you , but I 'll die young and pleasanter to remember . p. 127 FRANZ JOSEPH Must we believe that the first prince of Europe , in his pride of mind and hope , will die for love  --  the love of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll never glimpse what thin partitions part our life and death , to a dweller on the threshold . This prince is only a walking apparatus for oxidation , a web of water , spun to last one morning . A morning more or less will hardly count . A burst of gun-fire is heard from the wood ELIZABETH Let me have this , at least , out of my sacrifice , that the son I bore to be a Hababurg king , will be a king ; let me have this ! Whatever else I had when I was young is gone now , melts beneath a finger 's touch , like the tapestries they lift into air from a Pharaoh 's tomb . When I have walked the Hofburg rooms , this alone was real , that you were Rudolph , and my son , and would be king though the very walls dissolve , and I dare not speak to those I pass lest there be no one there but my imagining . RUDOLPH We are all ghosts , we three , walking the halls of Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of kings that crossed the stage and stumbled into dark before we came . We are the shadows cast by medieval conquerors , a rout of devil-faces , thrown up long ago by the powers beneath erupting , but long dead and gone to slag . Now the earth boils up again and the new men and nations rise in fire to fall in rock , and there shall be new kings , not you or I , for we 're all past and buried , but a new batch of devil-faces , ikons made of men 's hope of liberty , all worshipped as bringers of the light , but conquerors , like those we follow . I leave the world to them , and they 'll possess it like so many skulls grinning on piles of bones . To the young men of Europe I leave the eternal sweet delight of heaping up their bones in these same piles over which their rulers grin . To the old and dying I leave their dying kingdoms to be plowed by the new sowers of death  --  fools like myself who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves in power by killing men , as time was , as time will be , time out of mind unto this last , forever . We are all ghosts , we three , but from to-day I shall not haunt the Hofburg halls , Habsburg or Wittelsbach , wolf , sheep or shadow . So saying , light of heart , I lie with the Vetsera . He makes one of his stiff little bows , steps into the bedroom , withdrawing from royalty , and closes the door . ELIZABETH runs to it p. 128 ELIZABETH Rudolph , Rudolph  --  you can not , can not  --  Rudolph , open to me , your mother ! There is a shot within the room FRANZ JOSEPH We have no son . Hoyos enters ELIZABETH Hoyos , here  --  quick , It 's Rudolph  --  HOYOS What has he done ? ELIZABETH Break down the door ! He went in  --  he may be only hurt ! Hoyos  --  Hoyos ! HOYOS I shall need help with this . ELIZABETH Help him , Franz . FRANZ JOSEPH Help him ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was too much a prince not to die if he wished . And he is dead . ELIZABETH You wished him dead ! FRANZ JOSEPH I loved him . I must think now how to go on without him . ELIZABETH How to go on ! What could we go toward now ? FRANZ JOSEPH Toward the same darkness he prophesies , perhaps  --  Oh , Rudolph , my son , would I had died for you . Would I had died  --  This must be covered up . We have not been seen here . Hoyos will bring us word to the palace . Get the girl in the earth to-night . An accident  --  a hunting accident  --  There is faint gun-fire in the distance                                                                @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
