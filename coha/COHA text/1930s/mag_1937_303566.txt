As anticipated fortnight ago when tense young James McCauley Landis retired from the chairmanship of the Securities &; Exchange Commission to become Dean of the Harvard Law School , tense young SECommissioner William Orville ( " Bill " ) Douglas was last week elected to succeed him . Like his predecessor , a missionary 's son , Bill Douglas was born in Minnesota 38 years ago , grew up in Yakima , Wash. , since 1932 has been Sterling Professor of Law at Yale . On leave from that top-notch teaching berth since 1934 to assist the SEC , he has been a commissioner since January 1936 . Upon his election to chairman by his fellow commissioners last week he hustled to Washington for a brief conference , then hustled back to his vacation home near Chatham on Cape Cod to rusticate until this week when he will actually take his new job .
