When asked whether he intended to reinstate Healy in the Department of Plant and Structures as a result of the refusal of the county grand jury to indict him , Mayor Walker at City Hall said last night that he would await final disposition of the case by Judge Allen and before the Federal grand jury before acting . By its action yesterday the county grand jury cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Thomas T. Tommaney , chief clerk in the office of Sheriff Farley , of any wrongdoing in connection with Ewald 's appointment . The charge investigated by the grand jury was that$10,000 received by Healy on the eve of Ewald 's appointment was paid by Mrs. Ewald through Tommaney as the interimnary .

Schirp , a member the political committee of the : euben Society , which urged Ewald 's 3pointment upon the Mayor . Both Boczor and Dr. Schirp were itnesses before the grand jury yesrday . Boczor was permitted to re ) at his story but Dr. Schirp , acording to statements made by him to newspaper men after his appearance In the grand jury room , was not asked about the $2,000 payment . In previous statements to reporters he had denied vigorously receiving this money , and together with Ewald denounced Boczor as a " liar . " Other witnesses before the grand jury yesterday were John J. Myers , a member with Dr. Schirp of the political committee of the Steuben Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office and that of District Attorney Crain . New Witness Sent Home . The last man to enter the grand jury room was one who for a while appeared as another " mystery witness , " a role enacted by Boczor earlier in the investigation , but who was later identified as Jacob Cash , a former United States marshal . It developed , however , that he had been , presented to the grand jury by mistake and knew nothing of the matter under investigation . He said he was told to go home and " keep his mouth shut . ' According to officials in Mr. Crain 's office , Cash was sent to Mr. Crain by Mr. Tuttle . No confirmation of this could be obtained , however , in the Federal Building . Attaches in Mr. Tuttle 's office explained that Cash may have come there saying he had knowledge of the circumstances surrounding Ewald 's appointment and was told to go to the Criminal Courts Building to tell his story . That Cash may have found his way to the Criminal Courts Building through Mr. Tuttle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had held a conversation with Mr. Tuttle over the telephone immediately upon completion of his presentation of evidence and upon adjournment by the grand jury for luncheon . It was explained at Mr. Crain 's office that the purpose of the conversation was to enable Mr. Crain to learn whether Mr. Tuttle had any other material which should be presented to the grand jury . For this , too , there was no confirmation beyond the fact that the telephone conversation between the two prosecutors had actually taken place . Neither of them would say , however , upon whose initiative tilt conversation was held . Neither Mr. Crain nor Mr. Tuttle would comment on the refusal of the county grand jury to indict . Asked how much evidence he had presented to the grand jury beyond that originally sent to him by Mr. Tuttle as a result of the latter 's inquiry into Healy 's income tax payments and the affairs of the Cotter Butte Mines , Inc. , in which Ewald was a director and as a result of which he has been indicted with others for using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuttle has not presented more than 5 per cent of the evidence . " In reply to a question as to why he did not summon George W. 01-vany , former leader of Tammany Hall , and John J. Mara , Tammany leader of the Twenty-third Assembly District , before the grand jury , Mr. Crain , who heard both these men in private , said " they gave no evidence that bore on the inquiry . " Crain Resumes Vacation . Mr. Crain then left his office for Southampton , L. I. , to resume his vacation , which was interrupted by his investigation. - will return to the city on Mondy , however , to tie present when the grand jury submits its report to Judge Allen . According to evidence attributed to Mara when he testified before the Federal grand jury Mr. Olvany had approached him on the question of Ewald 's appointment as a magistrate with the request that Mara give his backing to the appointment , which Mara refused , whereupon , Mara is reported to have said , Mr. Olvany addressed himself to Healy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crain , while Mr. Olvany , when before Mr. Crain , was not asked any questions bearing upon Mara 's alleged testimony . To Mr. Crain Mara said that Olvany did discuss with him the filling of the vacancy to which Ewald was ultimately appointed but that no mention was made of Ewald 's name . Ewald Reiterates Story . Ewald was the principal witness before the grand jury yesterday . He was permitted to testify after his attorney , I. Nicholas Gordon , had written a letter to the grand jury asking that his client be allowed to appear and after Ewald had agreed to sign a waiver of immunity . He was in the grand jury room twentythree minutes . Emerging flushed and smiling , Ewald said that he repeated to the grand jury the story he had told privately to Mr. Crain , namely , that he knew nothing of the loan made to Healy by his wife through Tommaney . ' " I was questioned principally about the loan made by my wife to Thomas Tommaney , " Ewald said . " I told them I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read it in the newspapers . I then asked Mrs. Ewald , ' what about this loan ? Why have n't you ever told me about it ? ' I told them that my wife told me the reason she had not mentioned the loan was that she ' had lost the note and did not want Tommaney to know about it . ' I made the same statement to Mr. Crain last week . " I informed the grand jury that I told Mrs. Ewald that she had done the same thing in 1924 when she did not disclose to me until some time afterward that she had made a loan of $7,500 to the Kerman Brothers Film Exchange without security . I upbraided her for making these loans and also asked her why she had n't told Mr. Tuttle about it . She made the same answer again , that she did n't want Tommaney to know that she had lost the note . " Ewald declared that neither the grand . jurors nor Mr. Crain had asked him any questions about his appointment . Asked by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been paid to Dr. Schirp , Ewald replied : " No , I was n't even asked about that . " Dr. Schirp Questioned . " I wonder what they called me for ? " was Dr. Schirp 's statement as he left the grand jury room . He said that he was not asked concerning Boczor 's charge that he received $2,000 in connection - with Ewald 's appointment and that it was he , Dr. Schirp , who " made Ewald a judge . " " I was asked my name and address by Judge Crain , said Dr. Schirp . " When I gave these I was asked if I knew Ewald . I said I had known him for twenty years . I was asked if I knew Healy and I said I had seen him once or twice . I was asked if I was a member of the Cayuga Club , Healy 's organization , and I said no . " I was shown a letter to Mayor Walker and asked if my signature was on It and I said , yes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing downtown which may have been the City Hall , for the Mayor . Then they ' let ' me out without asking me about any of those things Boczor has said . It looked to me as if , Mr. Crain is not relying on the El'aczor story at all , but is after somethini else . " Boczor , who followed Schirp into the grand jury room , remained then only a few minutes . He then re suited his seat in an ante-chamber. saying he understood he might b ( wanted again . He was not recalled however . To a qquestion as to what he told the grand jury , he said " gel it from Mr. Crain . " Meyers was before the grand jury about thirty minutes . He said wher he came from the grand jury room that Mr. Crain in qquestioning him had stressed his connection with- the Cayuga Club and the Steuben Society . Meyers said he had been asked whether he had talked to Healy about the Steuben Society , advocating the appointment of Ewald as a magistrate , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Healy about Ewald . In reply to a question by newspapermen Meyer also said he had talked to some of the heads of the Democratic organization in connection with his work as chairman of the political commit ? tee of the Steuben Society , but had never discussed political matters with district leaders . Meyers Explains Activities . " Judge Crain , " he said , " ever since he has been examining me , has asked me a lot of questions tending to show that there was a close connection between my activities as a member of Healy 's Cayuga Club and as chairman of the political committee of the Manhattan Council of the Steuben Society . " He asked if I did not have to consult and confer with leaders of the county Democratic organization in the course of my duties as chairman of the political committee of the Steuben Society . I told him that , of course , I had to consult the leaders of the organization , but not the minor leaders . " When I had a message from the Steuben Society , I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a mere district leader like " Judge Crain asked if I told Healy that the Steuben Society was trying to have Ewald appointed . My answer was that I did not confide that or any other ambition of the Steuben Society to Healy , and never discussed Ewald with Healy at any time , though we met occasionally in the Cayuga Club . " I did not know that he was to be appointed until after he was actually appointed , " Meyers added . " I returned to my - office in the late morning of that day and a clerk told me that word had come from City Hall that Ewald was to go to the ' Mayor 's office to be sworn in. - Saw Ewald Sworn In . " I tried to get Ewald on the telephone at Washington Heights Court , where he was acting as Assistant District Attorney . He was busy and could not come to the telephone . I jumped into my car and went up there only to find that he had gone to City Hall . " Back to City Hall I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being sworn in . " " It must be understood , " Myers explained , " that the Steuben Society was eager to have the credit for the appointment of Ewald . Judge Oberwager , whom Ewald succeeded , had been appointed at the instance of the United German Societies . The Steuben Society wanted the prestige of putting a mane on the bench all on its own . " I told Mr. Ridder that , he saw the point , and at once cooperated by writing the letter , referring the Mayor to District Attorney Banton as to Ewald 's professional qualifications and character . " Mr. Crain was in his office downstairs when the grand jury reached its decision . It was given to Mgt -- tent District Attorney Hastings gt. 2:45 P. M. , who immediately reported it to Mr. Crain.
