When he is standing for office , the week before election is a frantic period for any President . In off-years when he is not standing for office , that week is full of troublesome chores . Last week with his mind already on this winter 's problems-including railroad legislation , national defense , housing ( see p. 18 ) - Franklin Roosevelt did his big political chore to help elect Democrats who may assist him in carrying out his programs : <P> Speaking as " a citizen of New York " from his " own fireside " at Hyde Park he broadcast a pre-election appeal . Its theme was : " Social or economic gain made by one administration may and often does evaporate into thin air under the next . . . . We have to have reasonable continuity in liberal government to get permanent results . . . . * If American democracy ceases to move forward as a living force , seeking day and night by peaceful means to better the lot of our citizens , fascism and communism aided , unconsciously perhaps , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chores for specific candidates performed in the same speech : " I am proud . . . that I have never called out the armed forces of the State or nation except on errands of mercy . That type of Democratic wisdom was illustrated last year by ...

This was a crack at Thomas Dewey , 36 , stepping out of his unfinished job as District Attorney in New York County to run against Democratic Governor Lehman . <P> With his election duties thus disposed of President Roosevelt turned to consider matters that he knew would matter more as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national rearmament . While his aides discussed a separate " Emergency budget " for defense ; an air fleet of 10,000 airplanes ( instead of the 7,000 mentioned fortnight ago ) , provision in the War Department Appropriation bill ( now being drafted ) to equip for instant combat an " initial protective force " of 400,000 soldiers ( Regular Army plus National Guard ) , the President himself took action . He ordered a new navy dirigible built ( see p. 19 ) . He announced he had ordered a survey of all Federal lands and plants capable of being used toward Rearmament . Mentioned specifically were a War-time armorplate plant in West Virginia and the old New Orleans Navy Yard . The latter might serve the newly-formed Atlantic Squadron . <P> Scheduled to go to Washington this week , via Miami under a heavy guard , is a visitor with whom defense of the Caribbean would undoubtedly be discussed :
