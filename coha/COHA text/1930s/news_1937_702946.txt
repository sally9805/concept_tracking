txt Present indications are that the American Gas &; Electric Co may be added to the roster of corporations which will elect to pay a considerable surplus profits tax in the interest of maintaining its cash reserve instead of paying an extra dividend to stockholders . American Gas 8c Electric Co. on a consolidated basis reported earnings of $2.51 a share for the 12 months ended September 30 . Although there has been some letdown of electric consumption in its territory , mainly the heavy Industrial user , it still appears likely that about the same results will be recorded for the calendar year 1937 . If such results materialize , then American Gas &; Electric would be subject to a surplus profits tax of something in the neighborhood ? - /f $450,000 after payment of the regular $1.40 dividend on the common stock " Cheapest Way to Get Capital " ' There has been an increasing tendency among corporation officials in recent months to abandon the Idea of issuing new classes of securities to be used to pay dividends so as to avoid the surtax on undistributed earnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks states that it has been advising industrial clients that the cheapest way to get capital if any is needed is to conserve surplus earnings and pay the tax , particularly under current conditions when new financing is difficult to arrange and earnings in many instances are in a downtrend . Companies which are facing sharply increased costs such as the film producers ; companics in the textile fields many of which have the problem of possible inventory losses ; liquor companies which have accumulated bank debt may all be expected to conserve cash this year rather than to pay year end extras as they did in 1936 .

Nation-wide chain store companies in general are likely to continue to follow the practice of plowing back into their properties a good part of their annual earnings . though the leading organizations in the trade have had a prosperous year to date and took for moderately good business during November and December . This year such compaiaes will be particularly cautious in the amount of earnings distributed in dividends as " year-end extras " in view ot the beclouded business situation , though this line as yet has been affected only slightly by the recession now being noted in other branches of industry The trade is bending its efforts to strengthen its financial and inventory positions to the greatest possible extent in case buying of their goods falls off . Chrysler and Douglas The recent declaration of a $3 dividend by Chrysler Corp. , which carries its dividends for this year to $10 as against $12 in 1936. indicates that Chrysler will retain a larger proportion of Its 1937 profits than it did in 1936. unless fourth quarter profits are much less favorable than now appears likely .

Douglas Aircraft officials disclosed recently that they will recommend to directors that no dividend be paid during the current fiscal year because of the necessity of preserving large working capital to handle the company 's big bank of unfilled orders Pursuant to this policy , the company charged an undistributed tax accrual of $205,000. covering the first nine months of the year , out of its third quarter earnings . After this accrual , which amounted to 36 cents a share , the company 's net for the nine months was $852,795 or $1.49 a share . In 1936 . Douglas earned $1.74 a share for the year and paid no dividend but was exempt from the undistributed profits tax because its fiscal year ends on November 30 .

Pacifiz . Western Oil Corp .. which embarked on an extensive drilling campaign this year . also is likely to disburse only a nominal dividend although its net profits may attain the equivalent of $1.50 a share on capital stock Earlier in the year it appeared as if directors of American Gas would not be confronted with the dividend-vs. - tax problem because of anticipated deductions against the current year 's income by virtue of certain large refunding operations . The refinancing job particularly in view was that concerning its largest subsidiary , , , the Appalachian Electric Power Corp . Some $67,000,000 of bonds of that concern were to be refunded and if the operation has been completed it would have brought to the parent concern about $14,000,000 of cash in place of the Appalachian bonds held In turn , that operation most likely would have been followed by a bond call by American Gas &; Electric of some of its 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year when the system refunded Atlantic City Electric bonds In that year the premium paid on the call of its own bonds was sufficient to enable the company to adhere to its regular dividend of 35 cents quarterly without being subject to the penalty of the surplus earnings tax . Additional Funds Needed In connection with the Appalachian refunding operation it also was the System 's plan to raise some additional funds for financing ceitam expansion operritions With the new capital market practically closed during the past several weeks and the outlook for new financing not bright at the moment , the conservation of cash to meet whatever necessary construction costs arise is likely to be of paramount importance in deciding the disposition of 1937 earnings above the present dividend rate . Since the first of the year , electric sales of the American Gas &; Electric System have run ahead of 1936 by approximately 9% .

Retail commercial sales and domestic consumption still continue a fair rate of expansion over a year ago . They , of course , are the last phases of the service to reflect business recessions .
