" America 's farmers , " said a United Press dispatch from Washington last week , " need not worry about another serious drought until 1975 . " Reason : Dr. Charles Greeley Abbot . <P> Dr. Abbot , a grey , kind-looking man with a conspicuous mustache , is the secretary ( i.e. , head ) of the Smithsonian Institution , a distinguished authority on the sun , a longtime observer of variations in solar radiation . Dr. Abbot believes that on solar radiation depend temperature and precipitation on earth . He has found in the solar variations a number of periodicities which fit into a 23-year cycle and an even more important cycle of 46 years . Matching the cycles with actual weather records has provided , he declares , partial confirmation . Testifying last week on the Smithsonian 's budget needs before a House appropriations subcommittee , he gave it as his opinion that the U. S. is emerging from a drought period which began about 1930 . <P> " We are , I believe , on the very verge of recovery from the drought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We have no expectation of another one of such great consequence until 1975 , although . . . there will be a minor one during the decade 1950-60. "
