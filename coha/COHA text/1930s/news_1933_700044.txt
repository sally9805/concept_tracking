txt What of the Future ? To the Editor of The New York Times : NRA is fast becoming a very expensive bird . Merchants are finding costs of materials advancing rapidly , along with the cost of service and employment . Abbreviated working days are not bringing to many a corresponding increase in receipts . Taxes are mounting . Dividends are taxed , corporations are taxed in several ways , the small and unprofitable ones along with the big ones . The government levies taxes , the States levy taxes ; cities do likewise . It has been considered a great achievement that one sort of bookkeeping finds our budget being balanced at the expense of the profits and incomes of the people . Large corporations , due to changes made through NRA , have been unable to continue dividends , or else are making no profits since they increased tha wages of thousands of employes , many of whom now participate in days of loafing each week . Big business men are kept worried about their corporations and their own affairs , and some have begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep things going . With the multitude in the saddle , the thoughtful man must begin to ask himself what will happen when there is nobody left to tax . P. B. PUBLICO . New York , Sept. 2 , 1933.
