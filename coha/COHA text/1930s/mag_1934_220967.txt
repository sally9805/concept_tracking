The new boy never got to know the British school well . And after 13 days , when he was gone , the school realized that it never knew the new boy either . Sandroyd School , Surrey , so small that it is omitted from most British school directories , settled back to its usual existence last week , after the exciting thought that the pale little boy of 11 , the one with the bangs and the bony knees , had suddenly become a King , and for a moment the most spotlighted person in the world . Before breakfast Peter II of Jugoslavia was hauled from his dormitory bed and brought down to the headmaster 's office . His old tutor , a man named Parrott , was there too . The boy learned that his father had had a serious automobile accident , that he must go up to London at once . He packed the one brown suitcase that is supposed to be sufficient for Sandroyd boys , put on his belted overcoat and his school cap , got into the car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rumania , was waiting for him . Looking even more dramatic than usual , she wept a great deal , but would say nothing beyond the fact that there had been ' ' an accident , my God , a terrible accident . " There was a whispered conference among the grownups , and they took away Peter 's school cap . Faithful Mr. Parrott came back in a little while with a brown felt hat . It was much too big for Peter and settled down over his ears . On the Channel steamer he kept asking questions and was finally persuaded to play deck tennis with Tutor Parrott . Mr. Parrott missed the ring a good many times , and seemed distracted . At Paris the train stopped some distance from the station . Heavily guarded by police and still spouting questions , little Peter of Jugoslavia was rushed to the Paris residence of Jugoslavia 's Marshal of the Royal Household , while the rest of his party went to the Ritz. * Next morning Dowager Queen Marie of Jugoslavia , all in black and looking very pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter ran forward to kiss her she did something very funny . She dropped on one knee and curtsied . <P> " Peter , " said she . " your father is dead . His enemies killed him in Marseilles . Now you are the King of Jugoslavia . Never forget that your father died like a king . His duty is now your duty . His work is your work . To do those things for which he gave his life must be your constant aim . " <P> Puzzled and tearful little King Peter kept crying : " But Mama , why did they do it ? Why did they do it ? " <P> That night the royal party set off for Belgrade and home . At Innsbruck one reporter was allowed to board the special train . He learned from Dowager Queen Marie of Rumania that Dowager Queen Marie of Jugoslavia was a very sick woman . Besides the gallstones from which she has been suffering in recent weeks , she had painfully ulcerated teeth . <P> Then Belgrade . At the railway station were the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional salver of bread &; salt , Deputies , generals , priests , rabbis , ladies-in-waiting . There , too , was a guard of honor , stiffly at attention , with the national colors draped in black . Little King Peter knew what he must do . Loudly his childish treble piped out : " May God help , heroes ! " Back came the bass roar of the Guards : ' ' God keep you ! "
