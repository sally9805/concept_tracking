Great Expectations ( Universal ) . If any scenarist but Charles Dickens had brought the synopsis of this picture to a Hollywood producer , he would have been labeled a clown . An implausible rigmarole about old convicts , London swells , blacksmiths , eccentric old ladies , orphans with mysterious benefactors and gypsy servant girls , animated by coincidence and honeycombed with nonsense , its only similarity to a salable cinema narrative is a banal happy ending . Its main plot line , concerning the love of a young man , Pip , for an arrogant debutante , Estella , is confused by being intermittently subordinated to a mystery story . <P> The mystery story , about the convict Magwitch and his life-long feud with the blackguard who stole his wife , is blurred by the fact that Magwitch never seems quite sure whether he is villain or hero . In addition to this , the characters have names like Pocket , Jaggers , Gargery and Pumblechook . In spite of all these eccentricities . Great Expectations is superb cinema entertainment . It should go a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has lately become the most fashionable author in Hollywood. * <P> Expertly condensed by Gladys Unger and directed by Stuart Walker , the task of preserving the vitality of Great Expectations rests principally on the cast . Most memorable contributions to a gallery of 19th Century human oddities are made by Henry Hull , as monkey-faced Magwitch ; Florence Reed , as monstrous old Miss Havisham ; Jane Wyatt as cold-hearted Estella . Good shot : Magwitch eating cold porkpie in a graveyard . <P> *Now in production are David Copperfield ( M-G-M ) , The Mystery of Edwin Drood ( Universal ) .
