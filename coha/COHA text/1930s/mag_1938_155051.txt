Leaving Paris for Germany last week was tall , well-built , 21-year-old Grand Duke Vladimir , who two months ago inherited through the death of his father , Grand Duke Cyril , the title of pretender to the extinct Russian throne . Ostensibly " Tsar " Vladimir was going to Germany to visit his sister , the Grand Duchess Kira , wife of former Kaiser Wilhelm 's grandson , Prince Louis Ferdinand , remembered in the U. S. chiefly as a onetime Ford automobile factory worker . Actually , bigger things than a mere family reunion were in the air . <P> Meeting the Grand Duke in Paris were many of his White Russian " subjects " - generals now turned taxi drivers , counts reduced to waiting on tables , colonels who have become doormen . In a rented hall " His Majesty Vladimir II , Tsar of All the Russias , " held " court , " his subjects kneeling in obeisance as he proceeded slowly down an aisle to the tune of God Save the Tsar , the old Russia imperial anthem . Reported preparing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany , however , was a powerful , potential ally , a sworn enemy of the Communist Russia that must be overturned before the Romanovs can again rule . He was Fhrer Adolf Hitler . <P> No lover of crowns , Fhrer Hitler would nevertheless not be averse to using any sentiment that exists for a Romanov restoration in Russia to further his own ambitions for an " independent , " German-dominated Ukraine . A Romanov trek back to St. Petersburg ( now Leningrad ) is probably outside the realm of possibility , but a substitute throne at Kiev , capital of the Soviet Ukraine , might well be " Tsar " Vladimir 's if he plays ball with Fhrer Hitler , and if Nazi plans work on schedule . <P> That Nazi plans have been carefully worked out was evident last week when the German press speculated on the possibilities of a brand-new nation of 45,000,000 inhabitants springing out of eastern Europe , and printed a map of future " Great Ukraine . " Most of the new State would be carved out of the Soviet Union , where 30,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a sizable chunk would also come out of Poland ( 3,200,000 Ukrainians ) and a generous slice out of Rumania ( 800,000 Ukrainians ) . <P> The acorn from which the Ukrainian oak is expected to grow is the autonomous district of Ruthenia , eastern tip of the German-dominated remainder of Czechoslovakia . Poland tried to coax Hungary into grabbing Ruthenia last month , but Germany effectively vetoed the idea . The 725,000 Ruthenians differ only slightly from Ukrainians in dialect and religion . <P> In Chust , Ruthenia 's capital , a German mission arrived recently to form a " Ukrainian Free Corps " on the order of the Austrian Free Corps before Fuhrer Hitler absorbed Austria , and the Sudeten Free Corps before the Sudetenland was " freed . " The corps 's job will doubtless be 1 ) to undermine the civil authority of Poland , Rumania and the Soviet Union in Ukrainian districts , 2 ) to work up a separatist movement , 3 ) to create incidents which will eventually make " necessary " Ruthenia's-i.e. , Nazi Germany's-intervention to restore " law and order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
