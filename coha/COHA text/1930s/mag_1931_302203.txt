What did Herr Adolf Hitler 's Fascist flash-in-the-pan ( TIME , Aug. 25 , et seq. ) cost Germany ? This question Teuton economists answered last week with a tentative , staggering figure : 1,600,000,000 marks ( $380,800,000 ) . <P> They estimated that the " Fascist scare " drove this sum out of Germany , and that it has not returned . Short-term foreign credits have been withdrawn . Germans themselves have sent their capital abroad . <P> Part of the Hitler fireworks was a gesture of menace at the jews .

The banker has been getting his money out too . Silently the Jews have taken their precautions , taken upon Germany a terrible vengeance for the wild words of " Handsome Adolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German Reichsbank has had to put its discount rate up . This move has been successful . The flight has ceased . But with the rate 2% in Manhattan , 3% in London and 2% in Paris it was 5% last week in Berlin . <P> Up spoke Dr. Hjalmar Schacht , famed " Iron Man , " still by common consent a spokesman for German finance , although resigned as Governor of the Reichsbank . <P> " No God will help us , " said the Iron Man , " unless we help ourselves . " He added that the German press could help by soft-pedaling , and he pleaded for this help and more : <P> " Germany 's credit is damaged if one cables to the world that the so-called Hitler elections threatened Germany with civil war ; if representatives of municipalities continue to talk about the prolongation of city loans ; if one knows the finances of one 's own country so little that even Ministers are forced to change their statements every few weeks ; if one does not put an end to the socialistic policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
