txt Treatment or time News . To the Editor of The New York Times : Why do n't you , as a purveyor of " All the News That 's Fit to Print , " start a propaganda among newspapers for featuring highly moral happenings and good deeds on the front page , with appropriate headlines ? I believe the reading public would find this a relief from headlines about Dellinger escapades and similar happenings . The tendency to put a thrill in morality and generosity would certainly change the thinking habits of youngsters . Too many sensation seekers think they have to be criminals to be heroes . I believe the campaign I suggest would be economic and profitable to the press and improve the United States generally as a place to live . I am not a churchman or a religious fanatic , but I believe you can do more for your paper and the country at large than all the moralists and preachers in the shortest time that such a revolution was ever accomplished . R. C. H. New York , April 30 , 1934. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
