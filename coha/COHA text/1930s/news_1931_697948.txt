txt Returns of Class 1 carriers for the first four months of 3930 , as the petition for rate increases recites , are at a very low level as compared with others in recent years . Taking them in the aggregate , they show a decline in gross operating revenues for more than 242,000 miles of first main track of some $335,000,000 , or over 10 , , . Against this gross loss of revenue , expenses have been cut 3239,000,000 , or 17 ' , . and net operating revenue declined $96,000,000 , or over Results of the four months are at a rate which for the entire year would produce over $500.000,000 net railway operating income as against some $868,000,000 in 1930 . Of the three main " districts , " the Southern seems to have been hit a trifle harder than the Eastern or the Western , as far as loss of gross revenues is concerned . Its percentage of decrease is very close to 19 , , as against 18 6 , , for Eastern and 18.8 , ' , for Western . Nevertheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect , and the uniformity of their experiences is eloquent of the universality of the depression . In the matter of net operating revenue , the Western district has done better than the Eastern , and the Eastern has done better than the Southern . Of a loss of $121,000,000 in gross , the Western district contrived to save 393.000. - 000 in expenses , or so that the district 's net declined only $28,000,000. or 21 ' . , whereas the Eastern district saved $105.000.000 out of a $151,000,000 decrease in gross , and its net decreased more than $46,000,000. or over . The Southern district . out of a gross loss of over $62,000.000 , saved but $40,000 000. and its net decreased more than $22,000,000 , or over East Draws Less on Maintenance Looking at operating expenses by classes . the Eastern district drew relatively less heavily upon maintenance accounts for its savings than did either of the other two districts . Of a total decrease in operating charges for the Eastern district of about ; 105.000,000 , only 551,000 , - 000 came from maintenance , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total saving of $40,000,000 , drew on maintenance accounts fur nearly $24,000,000. or about ety , ' , . and the Western district drew some 53% of its total saving from a similar source . The saving in transpoztation expense in the Eastern district war . 32 ' of the loss in gross revenue . as against 26 ' , in the Southern district and 33 ' , in the Western . In the Eastern district , the best " regional " showing was made by the New England , where the gross loss was but $12,000.000. or less than 15 ' , , and the net loss but 33,000.000. or about 12,7. - : and here the cut in maintenance expenses was little more than half the total savings . The poorest showing was made by the Central Eastern region : i. e .. east of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh line . In the Western district , the Central Western region had a trifle the best of it so far as loss in net is concerned , and in the Southern district . the Pocahontas region naturally did better than did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moreover , the physical condition of the carriers is such that they can stand temporary cuts in Maintenance better than can the average railroad . The picture presented by these figures Is of course , not in itself a cheerful exhibit , and if it could be supposed that it represented a condition likely to be at all permanent , it would be gloomy in the extreme . That it presents a complete case for temporary relief is resonably clear . It as , however , equally clear that it is merely a reflection of the fact that the country at large has reached a stage where industry and commerce temporarily have shrunk to what virtually is an irreducible minimum . It is a minimum because manufacturing and distributive processes now are on a scale which barely is providing for wastage by use and by actual current consumption , if it is doing even that . For instance , the current rate of steel production under 40 ' , of plant capacity  --  even today 's enlarged capacity  --  hardly can be held over-sufficient to accomplish that much . year an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods are now rapidly being cleared and reorders can not be long delayed . I. C. Entitled to Patience It Is , therefore . essentially a case of turning a sharp corner , or to use another metaphor , of surmounting the top of the grade . What the rail carriers now are requesting of the Interstate Commerce Commission is a " pusher engine " to take the train over the hill . That the commission will furnish some " power " may be taken as most probable , although the problem presented to it has many troublesome features of which the public naturally knows nothing . It is not an omnipotent body , despite Its very large pcwers : and as bound by a law which defines those powers and the manner of their application It can not at as a " Cadi under a palm tree. - or to borrow Mr. Justice Holmes ' phrase , as a " Pie-powder " court . Its rules are such that a certain amount of tame must be consumed It Is reasonably certain that this time wall be held down as nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled to ask a little patience all around . There is another point that should not be overlooked in the figures themselves , and that is the fact that in the face of a rapidly falling gross revenue , transportation expenses have been so well held down -- a difficult thing to do In this , there is good promise for the future . when gross revenue Increases , for considerable of what has been learned in economies will be permanent , and in time will yield substantial net returns .
