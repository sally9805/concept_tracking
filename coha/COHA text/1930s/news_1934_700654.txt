txt Holding that a return of 7r , - is adequate for a gas utility company to earn during a depression . the Oklahoma Supreme Court has upheld the State Corpora1 tion Commission in a appeal brought by the Consolidated Gas Service Co against an order directing a reduction to 18 cents a 1.000 cubic feet from 25 cents for the first 100.000 cubic feet in the rates for natural gas charged at the city gates of Mangum and Granite . The opinion . written by Justice Wayne Bayless , also held that the 7 ' ; ' , rate will be deemed sufficient to cover all necessary tax charges . The court held further that 41-c. is an adequate depreciation allowance : that the commission retains jurisdiction over gas cases despite a longterm contract between the company and cities operating their own distribution systems , and that a public service company is not entitled to any increase in its rates in order to enable It to make donations or contributions to charitable or other civic causes . In the opinion of Chairman Paul A. Walker and Attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases pending before the commission and before the Supreme Court Mr. Baidridge said the opinion probably will result in a reduction in rates charged by the Southwestern Light &; Power Co. at Altus , Okla. , because that company stipulated several months ago it would cut rates 4 cents per 1.000 cubic feet if a cut of as much as 5 cents was obtained from the Consolidated . Still pending before the State Supreme Court are appeals of the Lone Star and Community Natural Gas companies from a commission order cutting gate rates 10 cents a 1,000 cubic feet and directing that the saving be passed on to consumers in 26 cities and towns of southern and central Oklahoma .
