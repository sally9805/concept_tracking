txt Controller Berry , in response to questions put to him by former Mayor John F. Hylan , outlined yesterdaythe facts concerning the city 's financial condition that Justice Hylan had sought . The picture he painted was not-a rosy one , but it was accompanied by the declaration that a definite policy of retrenchment on the part of the City Administration would get it out of all its financial difficulties . Mr. Berry accused Mayor Walker of having failed to promulgate the retrenchment program to which the Board of Estimate pledged itself last Spring , and added that that failure was responsible for the high interest rates the city is paying on its bonds . " If the City Administration takes a rational stand in - the near future with respect to the budget for next year , I am confident that the market for the city 's bonds will improve to such an extent that the interest appropriations may be reduced aboutthree millions below what will be required under existing conditions , " the Controller wrote . Decries R. F. C. Loan . Taking a slap at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to aid in the financing of public works , the Controller wrote : " From my knowledge of conditions in the money market , I can say with confidence that the city of New York will be able to finance all its wants once the City Administration has laid down a program of economy and taken steps to put it in force . It will not be necessary for any regular or volunteer representatives of the city of New York to go to Washington to solicit loans from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation or any other Federal body . " The Controller once more declared himself in favor of doing away with the Delaney plan of short-term subway financing , attributing to subways $80,000,000 of the debt service item in the 1932 budget . Of this , some $68,000,000 is for bonds issued for the new subway , as yet unopened . He put himself on record also as favoring the return to the Board of Estimate of control over all appropriations . No mention was macre of salaries as such , in the statement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ' on record as favoring the end of the mandatory laws that now control the salaries of a large number of city employes . Drop in Tax Collections . The Controller revealed a considerable falling off in tax collections for 1932 , as compared with 1931 , up to Aug. lb . ' In Manhattan alone the collections up to Aug. 15 have been $115,388,285 , as compared with $131 , - 286,058 , a falling off in the borough of nearly $16,000,000 . For the whole city the collections for this year thus far have been $210,919,845.02 , which is $19,000,000 less than the 1931 figure . The percentage of arrears is greater because the total tax levy for 1932 is $535,534,239.01 , as compared with $514,146,082.80 . He reported an increasing falling off of collections of personal property taxes , only 15 per cent of the levy having been collected last year , and recommended a tax on unincorporated business to supplant the personal property levy . He declared it was time for a survey of the city pension systems , and cited the large budget appropriations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Controller 's letter , taking up each of the points raised by Justice Hylan , follows : The amount which will be required in the budget of 1933 to cover deficiencies in taxes is estimated at $6,000,000 . The larger portion of this amount will require to be provided because of the noncollection of personal property taxes . In 1912 the personal tax levy was $6,297,944 , of which about 71 per cent was collected . In 1920 , when the State income tax became operative , the personal property tax levy was $7,116,247 , and collections dropped to less than 51 per cent . The receipts from this tax have been decreasing every year , until the amount now collected is only about 13 per cent of the levy . This fax is evaded in every possible way , and it should be replaced by a tax on unincorporated business , which undoubedly would produce a larger levy . The personal property tax levy for the year 1932 is $9,328,190.12 , the collections on account of which to Aug. 15 amounted , to $1,378 , - 494.63. 1933 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time even to approximate what will be required for debt service in the 1933 budget . The final amount will depend entirely upon the policies determined upon by the Board of Estimate and Apportionment . If no change is made as to the method of financing rapid transit construction costs , the debt service appropriations will show a considerable increase over those provided in the 1932 budget . If , on the other hand , the two issues of four-year rapid transit bonds now held by the sinking funds are changed so as to make their maturity fifty years , and if no additional issue of four-year bonds is sold , . there probably would be a reduction in the debt service requirements to be included in the 1933 budget of from $35,000,000 to $40,000,000 as compared with similar provisions in the budget for 1932 . The adoption of some definite plan of financing future public improvements , as well as the announcement by the administration of some clearly stated program of retrenchment with respect to the budget for 1933 , would have a decidedly beneficial effect on the bond market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short term securities are concerned . This should result in drastic reductions . in interest costs to the city , which would be reflected also in the budget of 1933 . Under present conditions interest payments on moneys necessary to finance the budget are at the rate of 5% per cent , while the $100,000.000 of bonds necessary to finance permanent improvements , for which a sale was held in January of this year , are at the rate of 6 per cent . The same rate is being paid on $10,000,000 of special corporate stock notes issued on July 6 , 1932 , and sold to the public . It will readily be seen that there would be a substantial saving in the provisions for interest at 6 per cent , as compared with 5 per cent , or even 4% per cent . From my knowledge of conditions in the money market I can say with confidence that the city of New . York will , be able to finance all its wants once the City Administration has laid down a program of economy and taken steps to-put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular or volunteer representattives of New York to go to Washington to solicit loans from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation or any other Federal body . Tax Collections Lower . The amount of taxes collected to and including Aug. 15 , 1932 , on account of the 1932 levy amounts to $210,919,815.02 Of this amount $191,077,832.32 reflects payments on account of the first half of the tax and $19,842,012.70 is on account of the second half of the tax . The total tax levy for the year 1932 is $535,534,293.01 , of which $272,431 , - 241.56 covers the first half year 's y and $263,103,051,45 is on the second half . The first half of the tax is due and payable in May and the second half , in November . A considerable falling off in collections has taken place in tha borough of Manhattan . Last year the collections were $131,286,058.15 , while this year the amount collected was $115,388,285.09 . The collections on account of the 1931 tax levy to Aug. 15 , 1931. were $229,814,268.90 , of which $207,972 , - 239.28 represented payments on account of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second half . The total tax levy for the year 1931 was $514,146,082.80 , of which $261,652,125.36 was for the first half and $252,493,957.44 for the second half . The collections on account of arrears of taxes to Aug. 15 , 1932 , were $54,591,084.54 . During the same period last year they were $54,734,595.76 . Up to the present time there has been a. considerable falling off in general fund revenues for the year 1932 as compared with the receipts of the similar period for 1931 . For example , there has been a decrease in the amount of the State income tax from $12,849,430.79 received in 1931 to $6,973,327.56 received in 1932 . Other receipts , however , have increased slightly this year , particularly those having to do with motor vehicles . The total amount estimated as receivable during the year 1932 was $114.243.673.17 . This amount will be realized . Obviously , we can not tell what the cash balance will be at the end of the year . We do know , however , that there will be a considerable reduction in next year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I should not care even to estimate what the amount of the general fund will be for the year 1933 at this time , because it is impossible to foresee what the Legislature will do which will affect cur receipts either by taking away from them or adding to them . Urges Economy Policy . The State Legislature should transfer to the Board of Estimate and Apportionment the necessary authority so that upon that Board will devolve entirely the responsibility of determining all appropriations to be made for all city purposes . Any program looking toward the future can not at this time be considered practical unless the authority to carry out - its provisions rests with the Board of Estimate and Apportionment . It should be obvious that a complete , well considered and definite , policy of retrenchment must be determined upon by the Board of Estimate before the Controlle would be in a position to furnish any information as to the future financial requirements of the city . The situation which confronts the city makes such a program necessary , and calls for immediate action  --  action which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxpayers are to have the relief to which their present condition entitles them . Upon real estate rests the larger part of the burden in our present system of raising moneys to finance the costs of city government . ' Who , at this time , does not know of the present predicament of property owners in the Greater City ? This applies , whether they are holders of large realty interests or whether they are the small home owners . Much of this trouble no doubt is due to the policies which governed the purchase and sale of real estate during the past decade . But we must acknowledge that the financial policy of the city as it relates to its transportation problems has contributed in no small measure to the now existing confusion . I am speaking now of the , : - Volicy of building subways practically by direct taxation . This policy represents 10 per , cent of the tax levy for 1932 . In any given case where- the financial embarrassment on a ' parcel of real estate can be ascribed to the tax burden the responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build rapidtransit lines which are intended to be and should be fully self-supporting when in operation . Included in the budget of 1932 are the following appropriations for rapid-transit purposes : System . Interest . Amortization . Total . Interborough Rapid Transit .

Without a change in the existing policy these amounts can not be appreciably reduced . Wants Pension Fund Survey . Many other appropriations , principally for salaries , are mandatory , and in connection therewith increases in salaries during the year 1933 amounting to at least $2,250 , - 000 must be made . The pension funds by the end of 1932 will have cash and securities amounting to from $190,000,000 tc% $200,000,000 . This enormous sum has been accumulated by budget appropriations and employes ' contributions during the past thirteen or fourteen years . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 . The contributions of members exceed present payments from the funds by $2,500,000 annually . This indicates that receipts , exclusive of budget appropriations , exceed payments by approximately $10,000,000 annually . The Controller recently called the attention of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment to the fact that during the past two years $2,800 , - 000 in excess of requirements was appropriated in the budgets for the teachers ' retirement system . Surely it is time that a complete , unbiased survey be made of . the existing retirement systems . If the City Administration takes a rational stand in the near future with respect to the budget for next year , I am confident that the market for the city 's bonds will improve to such an extent that the interest appropriations may be ... reduced about three millions below what will be required under existing conditions . The securities of the State of New York are selling on about a 3% per cent basis . About 60 per cent of the State 's revenue is derived from the city of New York . We are paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipation of the collection of taxes . The failure of the city administration to fulfill its declaration of intention , unanimously adopted by the Board of Estimate and Apportionment at a meeting held Jan. 20 , 1932 , is chiefly responsible for this very costly situation . That resolution stated in part that : " Resolved , That the city adminis tration shall forthwith undertake measures to curtail and postpone its plans and undertakings ; shall seek in every way to reduce the cost of its present activities , and shall endeavor to limit new projects to those which are self-sustaining in order that the city may the more effectively employ its resources in serving the vital needs of the people ; and further be it " Resolved , That studies will be promptly undertaken with the purpose of developing new sources of revenue and of determining what present activities of the city may be put on a totally or partially selfsupporting basis ; further that each . department head is hereby directed to submit his plan in accordance with the terms of this ' resolution and as promptly as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans . " This resolution was adopted as stated above on Jan. 20 , 1932 ? seven months ago . No complete plan has as yet been made public by the Mayor 's office predicated on the studies which each department head was directed to submit to him . Every suggestion which the Controller has made in the past to reduce expenditures and the tax bill has been disregarded .
