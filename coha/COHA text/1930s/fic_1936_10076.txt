go down the Ferton street holding to Pa . Pa is nervous . I have never seen him this nervous before . " Is is three hours before we can get a bus out of here , Pa , " I say , " what do you say we see a show ? " " I never saw one of them things and I do n't want to see one , " says Pa . " We got to spend some time some place . " " Well , just as you say , then , " says Pa . " Not as I care , but looks to me like we are goin to be late about gettin back home and doin up the work . Cows to milk , hogs to feed , mules to put in the barn , and your Ma ca n't do all that work . It is killin her .

" Funny how they do that , " he says . " I 'll have one on the boys Monday mornin . They wo n't believe me when I tell them about this . " And the picture shows a man 's wife in love with another man . They slip to a hotel . " Just like Jeff 's wife exactly , " says Pa to Finn . " That woman ought to have her neck wrung off , doin like that . " " Be quiet , Pa , " says Finn . " You are in the theater and peoplewill hear what you say . " " I do n't care if they do , " says Pa . " A woman like that ought to be shot . She is just like Brother Jeff 's wife , only she slips to a hotel and Jeff 's wife slips to the brush back up there on Big Sandy . " When we start to leave the theater Pa says : " The power of man is mighty to do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow weaker and wiser , and damned if I do n't believe it . The boys wo n't believe me when I tell them all of this . " And we go out where the bright lights in Ferton are flickerin . We catch the bus back to Kentucky . Pa says : " Work not done up or anythin . Here it is dark . We got about thirty more miles to go and walk four miles after we leave the main road . "  |p101Over  the silent , cold earth and back home . The stars shine in the heavens . But we need a lantern to see how to throw the fodder over to the cows . We feed the cows and the mules , slop the hogs and get in the wood . " Jeff and me used to do this at home , " says Pa , " but we 'll never do it anymore together . I 'll be the next one  --  I 'll be the next to go . If you boys ever work on a section I 'll hant you from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the hardest work . The men that set up in the engines and ride get five times much as I get . I 've worked like a dog and will come down to the end unless you boys take me and your Ma in  --  come down to the poorhouse . Goddamn a poorhouse to hell ! Our section is not far from the poorhouse and they got bastard babies over there , people crazy as hell and pregnant mothers . Got the damnest mixup over there you ever saw . What if I would have to go there in the end and take your Ma . Would n't that be awful ? I could n't stand to take her there the way she has worked and bore my children . This is a hard world after all . Think of it , so much to have and so hard to get . Yet , there is plenty  --  plenty , but not for me nor my kind . I ca n't read . I ai n't been no place . I never had a chance to go to school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Poorhouse may be all I 'm able to get . " It is the next afternoon . The rain is fallin and low black clouds , it seems , just scud above the leafless timber . The wind whips through the saw briars . The cows , standin humped up in the barn lot , chew on the ends of old cornstalks . The mules run alongside the fence and bite each other 's necks and snicker . " Sign of fallen weather , " says Pa , " when mules play  --  and sign of a death when two mules ride each other . " Just as I expected , " says Pa , when Finn reads the telegram saying that Brother Jeff is dead . " Gettin up in the paper to get a telegram , " says Finn . " Because of that telegram , " says Pa , " somebody will have to go to the poorhouse or the orphans ' home . That fellow that runs Jeff 's wife might take her now , but he wo n't take the children . They 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' home . Jeff dies a pauper after thirty-three yearsp102of hard work . I ca n't keep his children . I ca n't take them . I 'll do well to raise what I got . " We see Pa gettin ready . He puts on his old blue suit  --  his Sunday suit he bought from Lark Jenkins second-handed . He puts on one of Finn 's shirts and black bow tie . He takes a black hat out of the trunk and brushes it up a little . He wears it . Ma say he looks real nice . Pa walks out into the rain with all his good clothes on . He is goin to catch Number 8 . Pa has a pass and he can ride right up on Big Sandy . That is one thing they do . They haul him free . But he has to ride in one of the poor coaches  --  one for the poor people . But Pa is poor and he does n't mind . He would n't know how to act with them Big Bugs on that train in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes off as you leave the coach . We see Pa go . We see him cross the pasture , go between the wires of a barb-wire fence , then to the ridge road . We see him leavin in the rain . We do not want to go . We understand that Pa is a little nervous . Uncle Jeff 's house is a little two-room shack and part of us would have to sleep in a bed made down on the floor unless some of the neighbors would invite us to stay with them . Pa 's other brother , Uncle Joe , used to invite us , but Uncle Joe and Uncle Jeff had trouble about their wives fightin and they have not spoken to each other since last June . Uncle Joe 's wife called Uncle Jeff 's wife a slut . Finn and I do n't go . We leave it up to Pa . Finn and I , we understand . We were up to Uncle Jeff 's last Decoration Day . Pa , Uncle Joe , Uncle Jeff , Finn and me all went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hollow back of Uncle Jeff 's house and through heavy timber where the squirrels played right before our eyes . There was a white fuzz from the leaves of such dense foliage that it choked us to breathe it . " Here , " said Uncle Joe , " I used to carry Micky  --  you and Jeff back in 1882 . We had this in corn that year and Pap built that rail fence you see there . He split them rails and built that fence back then . " Pa stopped and picked up a rail . " The hands that split them rails tanned my jacket with a hickory withe a many a time . He worked like a brute and died a pauper , " he said . We gathered the wild flowers  --  the wild bleeding heart , the wild snowballs , the mountain daisies as we went along . Pa , Uncle Jeff and Uncle Joe helped us . Uncle Joe had to walk with a cane . We walked slowly through the woods , partin our way through the dense undergrowth of greenbriers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveled path . " This is the right road , " said Uncle Joe , " though I ai n't been to Ma 's grave since she was buried . I never wanted to go back . We have to go out here and through where Pap took that last forty-acre lease from Steve Bocook back in ' 93 . It 's all growed up till you would n't know it . " There was a dim toe-path leadin down through woods that looked as if they were the trees that Adam roamed among . " And Grandpa cleared this up once ? " I asked . " Yes , " said Uncle Joe . " We farmed this , cleared it up and got it in the first year . Put a rail fence around it to boot . " We followed the dim path through the ferns and under the tall trees . Uncle Joe carried the basket and parted brush with his cane . Soon we came to a point out in a grass field that sloped gently down to a little valley stream of water . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Joe . When we got there no one could definitely locate her grave . Pa said : " Call old Joe Blevins over here . He knows . He still owns this farm , do n't he ? " " Yes , " said Uncle Joe . " Boys , " said Joe Blevins , " there are eleven of youn'ns buried here and your Ma is in the middle . She is number six . There are five before her and five after . Right here is the place at this sunken sankfield mound . " Uncle Joe spilled his basket of flowers there . Uncle Jeff said : " We three brothers are all that 's left . I 'll be the next to come here . I ca n't stand work any more and when a once good horse gets so he ca n't stand work then he is through . You know that . Now right here is where I 'll be put . You see to it , Mick . " pI04It was by a little peach tree . Finn stood under it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its rain keeps fallin here and Pa has just gone out of sight now , I understand . They will haul Uncle Jeff on a wagon around the skirts of that hill we walked over . It will be a long haul , but they will haul him to that point and dig his grave by that peach tree . The rain will be fallin perhaps . It will be white rain and will soak down where I crumbled the peach tree leaves and the faded blossoms last year . Dirt will be piled high there . Pa will be there . " Wonder if Uncle Jeff 's wife will be there ? " I think . It is best to let Pa go , for this is bad weather to sleep on a floor . We do n't want to do it . We know where Uncle Jeff will be planted for he told Pa and Pa will see to that . It will be where the green peach tree leaves and the pink peach tree blossoms were crumbled down last year . There will not be the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty the preacher is . He will go to church this Sunday night and see her , though he does not attend the Unknown Tongue revivals , for he chooses to cling to the Faith of his people , the Forty-Gallon Baptis . They are people who see no harm in drinking licker . The Unknown Tongues have come into their Holler neighborhood and have preached against licker . Anse will not go to hear them  --  but he lashes them with his tongue like preacher John Madden did when the members of the Baptis church met in the beech grove and prayed to God to drive out these invaders of the Faith . But Anse hears Fliam McCleanahan say : " You ought to see that Unknown Tongue preacher . Boys , she 's a beauty . She is one of the prettiest little tricks I ever laid my two peepers on . I am goin to get saved shore as the world if she keeps on preachin . I am goin to quit my weaked ways of doin and be a better man . " Charlie Blaine comes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Say , Anse Maddox , you want to come to church tonight over there at the pine grove . That Unknown Tongue preacher is pretty as a picture . Young men are gettinsaved right and left . Boys from our church too . Think I 'll get saved . She 's goin to show her Faith in the Word tonightby lettin a rattlesnake bite her . Might be you 'd like to see this since you fool around with copperheads , black snakes and blowin vipers all the time . " And Anse says to Fliam : " Soon as I feed my snakes and shave my face and put on clean clothes , I 'll be over . Might be a little late , but I 'll be there . You go on . Do n't let me hold you back . I 'll be about a hour late . " Fliam and Charlie hurry down the cow path and cross the drawbars . They are soon hidden among the tall corn on their way to church . Anse feeds his snakes milk and eggs and meat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week and it is time to feed the snakes . After he has thrown in a couple dozens ofp106eggs , three or four pounds of beef that he has brought from the smoke house and poured a gallon of warm sweet milk in a wooden trough , he reaches down with his hand and pats the old daddy rusty-mouthed copperhead on the back of the head . Daddy copperhead never moves his body . " Perfectly tame now , " says Anse . He runs into the house and pours hot water from the teakettleinto the wash pan . He takes down the mug from the top of the safe . He makes lather from the soap in the mug . He spreads the white soapy foam on his face . He takes out a long black-handled razor from a case on top of the safe . He rakes it a few times across his pants ' leg . Then he begins to take swaths down his face like he is cutting grass with a scythe . " I 'll soon be ready . I 'll see that preacher tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Anse shaves the part beard and part milkweed furze from his eighteen-year-old face , he runs to the hickory-pole clothesline upstairs and grabs his best pair overalls and a blue store-bought shirt . The overalls are pretty and clean and the starch in the shirt smells sweet and clean after smelling all day in the cornfield the old sweaty sour-smelling work shirt and the weed-stained overalls . He gets the black slippers he picked blackberries and bought last week over in Riverview . Anse runs to the mirror now . There he sees himself , a tall beanpoleboy with hair the color of rye straw and eyes almost mullein-leaf gray  --  a slender face that has been tanned by the cornfield sun to autumn oak-leaf brown . And the blue overallsand the blue store shirt and the black slippers  --  how they match . Anse turns before the mirror and twists to get a view of his back , his shoulders , and his face . " W'y I look good as them boys over in Riverview that dress up all the time and do n't have nothin to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bean-pole boy , runs down the path past the snake box , past the barn  --  he leaps the drawbars  --  takes across the buckwheat field  --  then through the corn patch . Dew has fallen on the corn blades and that remindshim he must not get his clothes wet with dew . He mustpI07not run anymore or he will get wet with sweat . He slows down to a fast pace . He wants to get to the meeting . He can hear them singing , over across the creek now . He can hear them muttering words to God no human beings but members of their church can understand . He has often wondered if they can understand . He wants to get across the creek and up the cliff to the pine grove where the young woman is preachingand showing the Faith in the Word by letting the rattlesnakebite her . Anse sees the creek is swollen from recent rains , but he knows where a tree has fallen across the creek and serves as a foot log in time of highwaters . So he runs to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a beech tree , Anse runs across the body of this log , like a squirrel  --  and then through the dead branches of the top . He is now across the creek . He knows an easy way to get upon the cliff without having to go all the way around the circling wagon road . There is a footpath with a cedar tree which serves as a ladder , for its branches have been cut off and little steps are left of branch stubs . He climbs this tree and is right up near where the meeting is . Anse can hear the singing and the shouting amid the sweet strains of the guitars . He can not wait . He takes no path around , but he plows through the patch of green ! persimmon and pawpaw brush and finds himself before a congregation of Holler people . Lanterns are swinging to the pine boughs and the dim lanternlights light up the green boughs of the pines . The white and gray moths flutter around the lanterns seeking the light . They beat their thin wings against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white light from the stars in the robin-egg-blue colored sky . And there is a big harvest moon among the stars that seems to be gliding through robinegg-bluewaters like a golden sail and spreading a golden light down on a green world . The whole overhead Anse thinks is pretty . It is one of the prettiest roofs he has ever seen  --  far prettier than a new red-oak board roof just nailed on a new log house with all of its sweet red-oak wood smell . Alas for the roof ! Alas for all  --  the young preacher risesp108from prayer . She has been kneeling down by a pine stump . It is the mourners ' bench . Perhaps this stump was once part of the split pine log seat Anse is sitting on . There are split pine logs the people sit on . The ends of these logs rest on piles of stones and stumps . Pine needles and pine burrs are scattered over the ground floor . Anse can feel them through the new black slippers on his feet . If he had been barefooted they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutter plow without shoes  --  that follow the cattle with only one shoe and that one near the oxen . But that pretty preacher ! Never was there a mountain girl as pretty  --  there she stands upright now . She is from Ohio  --  that far-away Ohio . Anse heard she was from there , but that does not matter . Here she stands unafraid before his people  --  going to let a rattlesnake bite her . To Anse her black hair was prettier than the love-vines after the frosts have curled them black . And there are black combs with white sets in her long black free-to-the-wind hair . The white sets sparkle from the dim lights of the lanterns where the wing-beating insects hum-hum in the night air . There is a white bracelet on her arm  --  Anse can see it loosely slide up and down her arm as she lifts her arm toward Heaven . The sleeves on her arm are loose like a robe that Anse thinks God used to wear when he was on this earth . Her dress is white and flowing like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is white as the petals of a white morning-glory and just as fresh as a white morning-glory petal in the June morning dew . Her lips are soft-looking and curved enough in her smiles to show her two rows of straight white teeth . " She must be an angel from Heaven , God has sent here to the Holler to save us mortals from the gates of Hell , " Anse thought silently . " She 's pretty as a angel in Heaven . " Anse noticed on the very front log sit Fliam and Charlie . They are drinking in every word the young preacher says . Anse watches Charlie look at Fliam and Fliam look at Charlie . Anse watched both of them though they could not see Anse watching them . " They are in love with Sister Combs , " Anse says to himself , " but she do n't want lazy boys like neither onepI09 of them . They ai n't no count to work . They ai n't no count for nothin . They are weaked  --  cuss and drink licker and chew tobacco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If she does I 'll tell her about them . Onery things tryin to go with a angel like she is . God sent her here . How can she get up and preach the Word like that when she ai n't a day over eighteen years old if she do n't have the Spirit of God in her ! " " If you have the right kind of Faith in the Word , folks , you will let a rattlesnake bite you . Do n't the Lord say in Luke 16 , Thou shalt take up Serpents ' ? People , you can not have the Faith in the Word and drink whisky and use filthy terbacker . What will you do in Heaven for whisky and terbacker ? There will be no saloons there . There will be no spittoons there . You will not want to dirty the streets of gold with old black amberspit . You will not want to get drunk in Heaven . People , why do you do it ? I will show you my Faith in the Word . " And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy screen wire over the top of it . She holds it before the congregation . They can see the huge rattler writhe in the box under the dim lantern light . They can see him lick his tongue out and his forked tongue quiver as the pine needles quiver in the wind overhead . " Sing a song , folks  --  " And the guitars begin to strum over in the corner . They are played by three pretty girls . And these words thunder loud as the people in the congregation sing . I 've been redeemed , I 've been redeemed , By the blood of the lamb , BY THE BLOOD OF THE LAMBSaved and sanctified I amI 've been redeemed  --  I 've been redeemedYou ca n't go to Heaven on roller skates , You 'll roll on through Heaven 's pearly gatesI 've been redeemed  --  I 've been redeemed  --  pIIOYou ca n't go to Heaven , girls , and wear a rat , You ca n't go to Heaven , men , and carry a gat , I 've been redeemed  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down there to pray , Well I got so happy , folks , stayed down there all day  --  I 've been redeemedYes , I 've been redeemedBy the blood of the lamb , BY THE BLOOD OF THE LAMBAnd saved and sanctified I am , I 've been redeemedOh , I 've been redeemedPeople now are standing and holding hands and uttering words no one but the Unknown Tongues can understand . It is the language by which they commune with God . Can you understand the wind ? Does the wind say words ? Do they say words ? If you could only hear . They moan like the wind overhead in the pine needles and they sisish-sh-sh like the wind going through the persimmon and the pawpaw sprouts on the cliff top . And now the music is growing swifter . People are falling on the pine needles between the log seats . People are saying words not understandable and they are groaning and looking toward the stars . Amid the din of groans and the swift , almost dance music , one can hear , " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She got saved last week . Them babies Nettie Shuttleworth is holdin up there is her babies . See her down there rollin in the weeds . " " That is Bob Harriman over there rollin and talkin in Unknown Tongue to God . He used to be a Forty-Gallon Baptis . He got saved here the other night and he got up and told the people if they only knowed what he knowed they 'd all get out of that Forty-Gallon Baptis Church . He said the Devil had ' em good as he wanted ' em drinkin licker and playin cards and chewin that old filthy tobacco . " " That is Abel Pratt over there . He come clean the other night and confessed to shootin Bill Abrahams at the squarep111dance that night . Do n't know what the Law will do with him now . He got that smart lawyer over in Riverview , Silas Stump , and he beat the court and proved himself innocent . Now he has come clean with the whole story . " And there sits Anse watching Fliam and Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crying and shouting as they go : " I 'm a lost man . " " I 'm a lost man , I 'm deep drownin in the rivers of sin . " Sister Combs says : " Bless your sweet young hearts . You fine-lookin young men comin up here tonight . God needs every one of you . " Chills run over Anse 's back when she said this . He wanted her to say something like this to him . He did n't like Charlie and Fliam . A horror struck him all at once . He hated these boys now . Last Sunday they were friends and fished together in Goat Creek . But now he hated them . He turns his eyes toward Tim James . There he sits looking at his wife . He looks like a gorilla . There is horror beaming from his narrow bean-slit bullet eyes . The blue beard on his face is three days old and his hair is down on his neck . His lower lip sags and there is amber spit gathered in the corners of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad bent shoulders and one suspender is fastened over his shoulder while the other falls limp and dangles down on the leg of his jeans pants , patched and dirty . He says over and over to himself : " Nothin to these UnknownTongues . I thought I told her about comin over here . Rattlesnake . Bet it 's got its teeth pulled . " He looks at his wife and then at Sister Combs . " FortyGallonBaptis is the only church on God 's side . Ai n't nothin to these Tongues . Rattlesnake . Bet it 's got its teeth pulled . " " Now if you do n't believe that the Unknown Tongues have Faith in the Word , let me show you God will not let the poison from this rattlesnake hurt me . He says , Thou shalt take up serpents . ' " And from the little box with the wire top , she takes the huge rattler that shakes a warning with his tail and writhes through her hands . He squirms up in her hand till he has good biting action with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She works her arm toward the snake 's head . The snake bites her . Again , she moves and the snake bites her . The people hug close to each other , shudder and say , " 0000 - 00  --  00  --  00 , my goodness . That snake . " Tim James rises from his split-log seat and he walks up towardSister Combs . People think he is going to the mourners ' bench . When he gets up to the preacher , he says : " Give me that snake . Give me that snake , I said . " Sister Combs gives the snake to Tim James . He catches it by the neck and it bites him and someone says , " It will kill you , Tim James , a Forty-Gallon Baptis with no Faith . " " It wo n't kill me neither . This snake ai n't got no teeth and I 'll bet you a dollar it ai n't . " Tim gets his big butter-paddle hand over the rattler 's throat and he chokes its mouth open : " Come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needles and come here . It ai n't got a tooth in its head . " " You just ca n't see them . It 's got ' em . " " If it ai n't got no teeth , I 've got a rusty-mouthed copperheadover home in the pen I 'll go and fetch and show you who 's got Faith in the Word and who ai n't , " says Anse as he rose from his split-log seat and carried a couple of splinters in the seat of his overalls with him . " Sister Combs has got Faith in the Word and I know she has , Tim James . It 's you  --  you old bull you , that ai n't got no Faith in nothin but the Forty-Gallon Baptis . I 'll go fetch the copperhead . " Anse runs from the congregation  --  through the bushes he goes like a wildcat . " Maybe that snake ai n't cut its teeth yet , " Mart Findley says to Tim as he still chokes the snake 's mouth open and looks into the place where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be old enough to have tushes , " says Tim , "  --  got seventeen rattles on it and two buttons . " Sister Combs stands amazed in the pulpit by the stump . There stands Tim James pranking with the snake as if there were no church but a snake show . And over to the left of him is Lulu James down on the pine needles talking to God in Unknown Tongue , unconscious of all going on  --  at least inpI13this world . Drops of sweat cling to her forehead like white icicles cling to the drips of the smoke house in winter . There she lies with her hair tousled and her two babies crying and screaming at their mother down on the earth , moaning words they do not understand . Fliam and Charlie have caught the spirit of the thing and now they lie down among the pine needles with many others . There is Jake Thomas down with them and Seed Lenix and Fonse Perkins , and Sylvia Moore and Daisy Redfern and Lester Oaktree . They are all FortyGallonBaptis too . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tim still playing with the rattlesnake and he says : " No wonder you let this snake bite all the Unknown Tongue people the other night to show people in my church that the Faith in the Word in your church was better . No wonder they all lined up around the mourners ' bench and you first let the snake bite you and then you went along and nudged its head to their arms and it bit all of their arms . No wonder . This snake has only got gums . It can only gum a body . " " Let us pray for Brother James , " says Sister Combs . " He needs our prayer . " And she kneels by the stump with her white face hidden down on the stump and she prays unknowable words among the other unknowable words to the God in the clouds above the pine tops . It is all a clatter of unknowable words . The babies are scared , but they pray for Tim James while he still fondles the rattler 's mouth and strokes its head and looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeking the light in their little night and the white and gray moths beat their thin wings still against the pine needles  --  while above the white clouds race across the blue heaven and the white stars and the golden moon give light . The wind plays among the pine needles and whispers in the sprouts . Anse runs every step of the way home and gets the snake ; and like a ghost , tall and thin , and dressed in blue with a pair of black slippers on his feet , he runs like a light tall ghost back through the buckwheat , through the dewy corn  --  cross the log that lay across the swollen Creek  --  then he scales upp114the cliffs like a ground hog , and up the cedar tree ladder like a squirrel . He holds the copperhead close to his bosom and when he reaches the top of the rock shelves , he plunges through the green persimmon and the pawpaw sprouts like a bull . There he was with the copperhead and they are all down in prayer . " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got the copperhead , Sister Combs . " She gets up off her prayer bones with tear-swollen eyes . Maybe it is the copperhead she was praying about . Maybe it is the bite it is to give her she has fear of . And all eyes turn toward her but the eyes of Fliam and Charlie and Tim James 's wife . They lie stretched on carpet of pine needles and halfconsciousthey lie there and slobber and groan to God . The pretty young preacher takes the copperhead and holds it to her arm . It bites her . She flinches . She holds it to her bosom . It bites her . She flinches . She holds it to her face . It bites her . She flinches . " Bite me all over , copperhead , " Sister Combs says , " I 'll show ' em my church does have the Faith in the Word . Now if the Forty-Gallon Baptis have it , come up here , Tim James , and let this snake bite you . " Tim stands still with his face looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground . He makes no answer . " Come on , " says Sister Combs , " do n't you have the Faith in the Word ? " " No , " says Tim . " Get in my church and get the Faith in the Word , " she says . " Bite me , copperhead . Bite . Bite me again and again , " says Sister Combs . And the copperhead bites her till its neck is tired . It charges at her face , breast , arm and throat till it can charge no longer . She goes back to preaching from the pulpit stump . She preaches loud among the din of the sinners crying already for repentance of their wickedness , such as shooting with intent to kill , chewing tobacco , drinking whisky and playing poker . And there is one repentance of a chicken thief and of a young girl who has given birth to a baby out of wedlock . She confessestrying to kill it before it was born by taking hot baths in water flavored with spicewood . After thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copperhead venom ? Where is it ? I can not feel it . I have Faith in the Word . Come all of you before tomorrow comes and join the happy throng . " " Maybe my wife is right , " says Tim James as he flings the rattlesnake over the heads of everybody into the green persimmonsprouts . And he runs up and throws himself down by his wife . People now come from every side , children and all . They gather close as they can to the pine stump , praying to God to give them mercy at this mourners ' bench . All go to the mourners ' bench but Anse . Only the pine needles on the floor and the empty half-log seats are left . They hold their faces to the earth and beat their fists against the ground . " God give us mercy . God give us sinners mercy . We ai n't never knowed the light before . " Anse walks from the middle seat up to the front . " Come with me , sweet angel , " says Anse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Holler . Come with me  --  " and he takes Sister Combs by the hand . She follows him . And they pass Charlie sitting on top of Fliam with his suspenders down from his shoulders and the white flesh at his waist line showing where his shirt has worked up on his back . Drops of sweat are on his face . Charlie is saying to Fliam , " Now say your words to God , Fliam , " as Charlie takes his fingers and shapes Fliam 's lips this way and that  --  " now say your words to God , Fliam . " Anse has the most beautiful earthly creature by the hand he had ever seen in all of his life . " Come with me , " he says again to her . " I am comin , " she says .

They go into the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his . They leave . a whole stack of human beings gathered around the stump praying for forgivenessof their sins . And as they walk down the narrow fox pathp116to the shelves of rocks , they can hear the cries of the people up under the pines . They can hear the winds in the sprouts near them . Here is a bright place by their feet and here is another bright place . The spots look like gold . " What is this ? " says Sister Combs , " this bright stuff under our feet . " " That is fox-fire , " says Anse , " ever see any before ? " " What is that stuff I smell that is so sweet ? " says Sister Combs . " That is snakeroot blossoms , " says Anse . Down the path , over the shelves of rocks , they went their way till they come to a green little bottom . " What is the yapyaplike a barkin rat I hear up on the hill ? " she says . " That is the barkin fox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little dew-covered grassy bottom , hand in hand . " Where are we goin ? " she says . " To my home , " says Anse . " You will go with me , wo n't you ? " " Yes , " says Sister Combs . Back upon the shelves of rocks they can hear shouting and praying as the wind blows toward them . " I loved you , Sister Combs , before I ever saw you , " says Anse , " when I saw you I was jealous of you . I did n't want Fliam and Charlie to speak to you . " Above them the bull bat screams , and Sister Combs flinches some and comes nearer to Anse . Anse would gladly pull her close to him and kiss her , but he is afraid . Each time he slightly pulls at her loose sleeve she timidly pulls away . They start to climb the next hill that leads up through the cornfield . Under the green hickory trees they go , Anse holding her hand and leading the way . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plenty of poison snakes in these woods . The fire drove them in these woods when we burnt the clearin last spring . You know poison snakes like to stay in woods where the fire has never burnt over the ground --  " " Yes , I 've heard that , " she says . They pass over more fox-fire . Anse reaches over and takespII7hold of her long braid of loose flowing black hair , blacker than the night under the leaves on the trees . He fumbles at her long black hair and he holds her hand more tightly . " What are you doin ? " she says . " I am tying you to me forever , " he says . And the sets in the combs in her hair sparkle in the dark . " I love you , " Anse says to her . " I love you more than any girl I ever saw . I want you for my own . I want you to marry me and let us live here . I can raise bread for us . Let me tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copperhead . I wanted to show them somethin . I wanted to show Tim James .

" " That copperhead did n't have no teeth ? " she says . " No , " said Anse . She tears loose from Anse and runs into the green night woods . She leaps like a deer . Anse stands still . He ca n't move . He can see her white dress zigzagging down through the dark green wood . Anse cries to her : " Sister Combs . Sister Combs . Stop . Stop . Stop . " She goes on breaking the brush and running . Anse takes after her . He runs over the hill the way she has gone . He runs like a rabbit . There is no trace of her . Anse stands in a briar patch now , under the moonlight , and the angel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , forever . " If that copperhead had only had some teeth , " Anse says , looking at the wind quivering in the moonlight  |p118IT  is Sunday . Kirby and I have n't a place to go . We could go fishin , but Sunday bathin beauties are splashin the water , so the fish wo n't bite . We could go to the " singin " down on the creek , but the boys wo n't be the least bit friendly down there today after the little row we had last night in the dark . Kirby snaps his finger and says , " I have it . " " Have what ? " " W'y let 's crank the flivver and cross the hill to a Tennessee poorhouse . " And I say , " It 's okay with me . " The flivver chug-chugs like a mowin machine , for we have it in high gear runnin like a potato bug across a pretty Tennesseemeadow . Now we go down in the creek-bed road and the gravels fly  --  up through a wood yard and barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the bank , coast a little to save gas , and then we strain up the next hill and through a pair of drawbars and out where a pretty hard road squirms like a house snake around the Tennessee hills . " Wo n't be long about gettin there now , " says Kirby . We pull up to a barb-wire fence and Kirby steps on the brake . The Ford is hot and it blows like a hot horse . We get out and Kirby says , " There she is right over there in the field . " And I say to Kirby , " What 's over there in the field ? " " The poorhouse , " he says . " See that lean-to built out of rough oak planks that looks like a coal shed ? Boy , that 's her . That 's the poorhouse . " " The hell it is . " This poorhouse is a lean-to . However , it leans to nothin . It is built like a cow shed . It has five stalls in it . Each stall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heatin stove with a belly the size of a nail keg . Across the road the poorhouse keeper lives in a big fine two-story weather-boarded house . He sees us talkin to the inmates over across the wire fence on his premises . He comes over . " Hello , Kirby , " he says . " Hello , Radner , " Kirby says . " Meet my friend Stuart here . " We shake hands . His big hand has grown fairly soft for a farmer 's hand . It feels like a butter paddle . " You boys lookin here , air you , Kirby ? " " Yes , Mr. Radner , we 're just out spongin around . " " Well lookp119around here and make yourselves at home . See what you can see . " Kirby takes a package of Stud from his pocket and nervously rolls a cigarette . " Tax got so high here on readymadesI 've gone to smokin my own . Ai n't near so much tax here on Stud in Tennessee as there is on ready-mades . " Kirby puts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match for Kirby . The cigarette is curved like a chicken 's bill . Kirby and Radner talk and I go down where the row of rooms begins . The first has an old woman in it . She must be seventy-seven . Her knee cap is out of place and is around on the other side of her leg . She grumbles and says her knee is nearly killin her . It and her leg below the knee are swollen twice the normal size . She says , " Oh , if I could only get out of this place ! " Out on a bench just below her stall sits " Uncle Peg . " He is the life and noise of the fifteen inmates of the poorhouse . " How did you lose that leg ? " " Lost it in the mines . Ai n't been much good since I lost it . " While I am here talkin to Uncle Peg a couple of small boys come out . One is a baby wearin a dress . I ask the boy his name . He says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name ? " Uncle Peg says : " He do n't know his name . He is a half-brother to this little boy with the dress on . His mamma is here . She is in that room down on yon end of the house . She is the only one that knows who their daddy is . She ai n't never been married . She did n't have no place to go with them two little boys so she come here . Them is right pert boys and if it was n't fer them here the place would be a lot lonesomer . " And I ask the older boy , " How old are you ? " " I do n't know . " Uncle Peg says , " ' That boy is eleven years old and he ai n't been to school a day in his life . Them boys is shore to God fine boys though . " Kirby is still smokin on the Stud cigarette . He is talkin to Radner too . They talk and Radner talks with his hands . He points to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the house across the road where he lives . I look along in the stalls . There is only one door to each room . That makes five doors along the front . I go on down where I hear a noise in a stall . Uncle Peg hobbles along on his wooden leg with me.  |p120We  go into one stall where a skinny man is lyin on a smelly mattress . " What is the matter with him ? " I say to Uncle Peg . " W'y he was sent to the pen in Nashville and they made a girl out'n him over there them fellars did and he ai n't been right since . He takes spells and he comes right out'n that bed and falls all over the floor . He bruises hisself up awful when he falls . See them little pipe-stem legs . He ca n't hardly walk on legs like them . I 'd ruther have my one good leg and my one wooden leg as to have both of his'n . Radner keeps them old overalls on him and no underwear because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mattress is nearly rotten . " There he is on the mattress a heap of skin and bones . His face is pale blue and his lips are a deeper shade of blue . Uncle Peg and I go on down the front of the poorhouse . In next to the last stall we find an old man of about eighty workin on a chair . And Uncle Peg says after we get past where the old man ca n't hear : " He 's been a bad'n . He 's kilt two men before he come here . He 's been in the pen . He wo n't do to fool with , but he 's good when people mind their own business . He used to work in the mines too . He 's busy all the time doin somethin . He likes to work . He ca n't quit work . He 'd go crazy if he did n't have a chear to fix ' r somethin . " In this last stall is a woman under heavy quilts on this hot June day . Uncle Peg says : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind . She 'll be right out'n that bed if you talk to her . Jist let her do the talkin and you listen and she 'll stay in the bed . " " How do you do , Buddy . What time is it ? Half-past the corner . Half-past the corner . Half-past the corner . " I do not answer . She pulls the quilts over her and lies back down in bed . There is a woman here that ca n't talk . There is a young girl here that helps Radner 's wife over at the big house across the road . There are two more elderly women here and two women I judge to be in their late forties . They sit on a little bench Radner had built for them in front of the shack . They watch the people pass down the road . There is not much for them to do around the shack . There is not much furniture in it . There is no yard to keep clean . Cookin is done over at Radner'shouse and carried across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I start walkin to where Radner and Kirby are : " Son , ai n't you workin fer the Government ? If you are working fer the Government ca n't you help get us that oldagepension of $25 a month ? That would be a lot of money and we could live better than we are livin here on that much money  --  $25 a month ! " Kirby is rollin another cigarette as he talks on to Radner . Radner says : " W'y they ai n't nothin here in this poorhouse but a bunch of whores , outlaws and killers . That 's all they air . They ai n't got nothin comin to ' em . Why did n't they work and save somethin like the good people 's done ? " " How long have you had the poorhouse ? " I say to Radner . " Since early last spring . I underbid a fellar round there in the bend . I bid tinder him a nickel a person per week . My bid was $2.30 for each one a week . Now I got fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you can make anythin out of that , Radner . How can you feed them fer that ? " " Now I do n't mind to tell you , boys . Just do n't say nothin about it . But I plan to feed them on $150 for the first six months . You see I got peas and beans in the garden , roastin ' ears and ' taters are comin ' in a plenty in the garden purty soon and I ai n't goin ' to be out much . I aim to feed them rough grub jist sich as beans , ' taters , peas , corn , middin-meat and greens . I 'll make about $678 in clear money . I ai n't tellin this every place and to everybody . But I 'll come out all right . And I get some help from here among these women . They help my wife . I can make it all right with what little gin-whackin I do about the place here .

We get inside and Kirby says , " I tell you I never want to go to no poorhouse and be treated like that when I get old . "  |p122IT  is summer now of 1930 . Hundreds of hobos , red , yellow , black , white , coal-dust black , are ridin the freight trains . No one can tell just the color anyone is for the coal soot . The hobos are coal-dust black a-sittin on heaped-up cars of Kentucky mountain coal . One can see them ridin the short blunt-tailed coal train , ridin on tops of the cars  --  under the sawed-off edges of the coal cars , on the couplin pins underthe cars on mattresses fixed on bed springs . They sit upon the heaped-up coal in the July sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dew begins to fall they go down under the car and sleep on the bed springs . The train comes down the Ohio River Valley , screakin , weavin in-and-out , out-and-in  --  puffin , blowin for the July sun and the burnin coal in the engine 's belly makes the train hot  --  cinders are flyin  --  coal-dust , coal smoke . It comes like all-outof-doors , only the train is black like all-out-of-doors is not black . But anybody walkin alongside the track will stop to watch the antics of this short train loaded with Kentucky mountain coal after it comes down Big Sandy and gets out on the main road line . It is like a man goin down the highway to the city for his first time . The sky is filled with July hotness . No one gives a damn whether he works weather like this or not . The section men do n't like the smell of the cross-ties they are diggin under the rails . They stand amid ragweeds wilted to the cinder bed  --  sweat streamin from their sun-cooked faces . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They like to see the train pass so they can rest their backs . It is a hot day . It is hot as hell . They stand and thank God they have a job of $2.70 a day in this Depression . They talk about the easy life of the hobo a-sittin upon coal cars and ridin all day in the sun with long wire hooks trained to grab their dinner buckets off the hand cars . They wonder when the Depression will end . If they are goin to get another ten per-cent cut on their wages.  | They wonder if this is the cut that will bring an end to the Depression . The train chugs smart-alecky by like a Jersey bull . Boss Man Oliver Pigg spys what he thinks is a " Shine " a-sittin upon a heaped-up car of mountain coal . " That black ai n't no coal black . That is real black skin , " says Boss Man Oliver Pigg . " I can pick out his eye with this turnip of a cinder . " " A five-spot you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cinder and catches the man on the temple .

" Good work , Boss Man Oliver , " says Rough-house Evans . The black man , coal-black or nature-black , rolls in the hailgrayballast . " God Almighty , " is all he says . His temple is caved in like an old cellar . The blood , color of rotted red-oak leaves , oozes like sap from the end of a burnin fore stick . " Accidental Death , " says Mule-face Hunt . " Accidental Death , " says Cackleberry . " Yeah  --  Accidental Death  --  " says Boss Man . " Better have Corner Stone though , boys  --  better to have it done in accordance with the Law . You know what Whale Isom got into over buryin that man like a cut-up dog that time . Have this done with the Law . You need n't pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you some cigars . " Corner Stone comes twistin like a wilted weed in the soft July wind . He comes up the bank . " Hot as hell , ai n't hit , boys . How can you stand hit out here nigh this rusty steel that draws like a open fireplace all the blasted hot-as-hell sun out'n the Heaven . Dead man , huh --  " " Yeh  --  dead Shine , Corner Stone .

Gettin dangerous for a nice woman to walk down the railroad track anymore . Scum o ' th ' earth rides these freighters anymore  --  yeh  --  rotten scum o ' th ' earth .

" " Okay , Cackleberry , " says Corner Stone . He shoos them with his sweat-wet handkerchief . " Hot day  --  a damned hot day to examine a stinkin black corpse . Pity the train did n't grind him into sand-ground sausage meat for the black cross-tie ants . Hot day , too , for a body to smell a body .  --  Smell of my shirt , Mule-face . Smells like a dead stinkin body . " Corner Stone takes a stick . He punches in the caved-in hole in the skull .

Ai n't nothin in his pockets to identify him by . Nothin but a piece of bread a mule could n't chaw . Craw is empty as a settin ' hen 's craw is empty in July when the worms all go in the ground . " " Must we take him to the morgue , Corner Stone ? " says Cackleberry . " Morgue wo n't have him when they ai n't no money for the undertaker , you know damn well .

Take him to Wheatley James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have his barn since they ai n't no Shines around here to take him to . I know old Wheatley . Tell him I sent you with him . " The truck ambled in with the County casket of thin un- covered knotty pine wood , and a little thin black suit wadded up like a sleeping black cat in the bottom of the casket . There was only the bosom of a white shirt and a little black-ribbon tic all gathered up like the tuckers in a petticoat Cackleberry Spriggs ' wife wore . The truck driver said : " You section men have to load him and dress him . The train killed him . You have to bury all the train-hit stock , do n't you , and the cut-up dogs . You have to dress this man , put him on the truck  --  unloadhim at the barn . I ai n't gettin no scent on me . " " Okay , big boy truck driver . Wait till someone pulls your chain .

Crank up and haul this man down there by the crick under them beech trees . You can do that , ca n't you ? " They undressed him . They threw water on him from their hats  --  washed off the temple blood . They put the County suit on him and the half-shirt and the tie . Only Mule-face could tic a necktie among the lot . " Yank him in , boys , " said Boss Man Oliver Pigg . Cackleberryat one foot , Mule-face at the other . Boss Man and Roughhousewith a shoulder a piece and into the pine box they throw him . The blue flutter of gasoline-smoke and wind comes from tail of the whirrin , dronin July-hot engine . The truck with men hangin to its sides like wood ticks to a cur dog 's back , ambled up the yellow sun-dried bank to Wheatley 's barn . The clover has been cut  --  sweet-smellin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no place for the coffin there . There is a place in the cow shed between the Iuanger and the feed box .

He is afraid to pass Wheatley 's barn . The next day passes . A day like the day before , dust , heat , wilted leaves , hobos of 1930  --  drouth  --  July sun with parched lips and parched land and empty bellies  --  an/other day . Time is goin . Children with ribbons on their hair  --  Wheatley 's two little girls come to the barn lot and pluck the wilted daisies thirstin to death for water and for food . They pluck the daisies and they say : " We smell that old dead man . Pop said he was swelled like a rat . " Another night : dogs lurk  --  hungry dogs with 1930 stomachs and carpet-wooled hair . They sneak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planks . They nose for a wide crack . Then they snoop through the sticker weeds by the manure pile . Another day : the buzzards circle the barn . The white-clean washed clothes includin Wheatley 's white Sunday shirt flip buoyantly on the clothesline . It is a hot wind stranglin the wilted guts in the barn-yard sticker weeds and the tight-laced daisy stems . No one calls for the dead body . Looks like it belongs to Wheatley . It has been in his possession two nights and two days . Ready for another night  --  another day ? " God , I 'd like to meet the boys for a game of stud , but damned if I pass that barn tonight . A black spirit may meet me and hant me . I fist ai n't goin . I do n't care what the boys says about me . Got to git that body out and bury it tomorrow . Got to get this mess all cleaned up .

They carry the pine-box coffin out across the railroad . Up through the wilted poison vine they go . They go upon the mountain side for burial . " Damned if I do n't get a dose of poison here in these vines . Poison takes to my skin like water takes to low ground , " says Cackleberry . On and on up through the mountain-side smotherybrush  --  where July soft wind ca n't seep through the green leaves like water through a sieve . Water streams off the leather- tan faces . Preacher Bag nearly faints . He braces to a few weeds . 1 le manages to climb . He carries a pick and the Bible . He is lucky . The section men bear the box on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs on the track and the uncalled-fordead . Here is the place they will bury the unknown man . On this side of the rusty fence . Within the rusty fence are the graves of white men and white women . Sunken graves where wilted saw briars trail over like cucumber vines . Here are broken pieces of dishes and little rusted tin-cups with dead flower stems . One grave is adorned with a wild rose . But they ca n't bury the black man over there . That is more sacred earth . They bury him on the outside of the fence . Cackleberry starts diggin the hole . Sweat streamin into his eyes . It is the wilted bushes that smother out the wind . It is the tall thin grass . Grass rass now dyin for bread from the earth and water to drink . The bread the grass has to eat is hard as the piece found in the black man 's pocket . It is just as hard and dry too . The hole goes down through the dry dirt  --  down , down , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good enough hole , " says Boss Man Oliver . " Good enough , boys , " as he looks down their sweaty collars like he does on the section . They put two plow-line ropes under the box and four men let it down into the hole  --  the hair strings flyin from the ropes . " Dust to dust , " says Preacher Bag , " dust to dust . His sperit color of the night goes back . Maybe it goes back to the night . But his sperit is some'ers about us maybe in this wilted grass . I lidin with beamin eyes right on us like a tiger 's eyes . " He sprinkles dry dust into the hole . He says : " This body will come out of this hole when the mighty trumpet blows and shakes the earth . Maybe all of us standin at the grave will see each other again . " " Shovel in the dirt , boys , " says Boss Man Oliver Pigg . The boys eat up the dirt by shovel spoons . Soon the dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather the ropes , picks , double-bitted ax and Bible and walk down the trampled moun/tain path  --  down to the railroad tracks across by Wheatley 's barn . " We 'll be down to play stud with you tonight , boys , " says Boss Man . " We 'll be at the tool house soon as I git washed up and these sweaty clothes changed . " " Okay , " says Cackleberry.  |p129GROAN  leads the way along the cow path ; his Disciples follow . The cow path is narrow , the pawpaw bushes are clustered on both sides of the path and they are wet with dew . Brother Sluss pulls a pawpaw leaf and licks off the sweet dew with his tongue . Brother Sluss is like a honeybee . The moon floats in the sky like a yellow pumpkin , dark yellowish like the insides of a pumpkin . Groan and his Disciples , Brothers Sluss , Frazier , Shinliver , Littlejohn , Redfern and Pigg , are headed for the Kale Nelson Graveyard . It is approximately one mile away , across Phil Hogan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cy Penix 's corn patch , thence through the Veil Abraham 's peach orchard to a flat where the ribs of an old house ( the old Abraham 's house ) are bleached by the autumn sun and cooled by the autumn night wind . The robe Groan wears is similar to the robe Sunday-schoolcards picture Christ wearin when He walked and talked with His Disciples . It has a low neck , loose flowin sleeves . It is long and tied with a sash at the waist line . The loose sleeves catch on the pawpaw twigs along the path . " Tell me more about the ten virgins , Brother Groan . " " I do n't know about the ten virgins and I ai n't discussin the ten virgins . You know there was ten of them , do n't you ? And you know one of them was Virgin Mary , do n't you ?

He carries a walkin staff in one hand . His loose sleeves are hard to get between the pawpaw twigs alongside the path . There is silence . Brother Groan talks to God . They keep movin . They come to the drawbars . One by one they slipp130between the drawbars , all but Brother Frazier . He is too thick to slip between the rails . He crawls under the bottom rail . Now they are goin through Ben Lowden 's pig lot . The moon above them is pretty in the sky .

Brother Groan is tryin to talk to God . " " I ai n't said nothin . " " No . " " It is the wind in the fodder blades , I tell you . " " The wind ! " " Did n't I say the wind ?

His sleeve catches on one of the stakes-and-riders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . One by one his Disciples climb over the fence . Here is the ripe uncut corn in the yellowish winecoloredmoonlight . The dead blades are whisperin somethin . Maybe it is : " The dead lie buried here , the dead of-ever-solong-ago . But they lie buried here under the dead roots of this ripe corn . " The corn blades whisper to the wind . There is a sweet dew on these corn blades for Brother Sluss to lick off with his tongue , for Brother Sluss is like a honeybee . This dead fodder is buff-colored in the yellowish pumpkin-colored moonlight . Brother Sluss leads his Disciples through the field of dead corn . There is a ghostly chill of night piercin the thin robe of Brother Groan 's ; and the overalls and the unbuttoned shirts of his Disciples . There is a loneliness in the night , in the moonlight that coversthe land and in the wind among the trees . There is somethinlonely about dead leaves rakin against one 's clothes at night , for they too seem to say : " The dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie buried here under the livin roots of these autumn trees .

One can not tell tonight . But comep132tomorrow afternoon when the sun is shinin and look . There are half-dead leaves on the trees and whole-dead leaves on the trees . The wind fingers with the leaves . Brother Groan 's sleeve has caught on the tooth of a peach tree . Brother Sluss hurries to free him . The sleeve is free now . The Disciples move on .

Here is the butt of an old field-stone chimney . There is a gatepost half-rotted . Ramble rose vines climb halfway the rotted post . Here is a bushy-top yard tree with hitchin rings stapled in the sides . I lore is a patch of blackberry briars . The wind blows through the blackberry briars and the blackberry briars scratch the wind . You ought to hear this wind whistle when it is scratched by the briars .

They are mutterin quarter-words , half-words and whole words to God . It is in the Unknown Tongue . Brother Sluss is on the ground now . He rolls out into the graveyard . He breaks down the dead weeds that just awhile ago whispered to the wind that the dead lay under their roots . Brother Sluss smashes weeds half-dead like a barrel of salt rollin over them .

" " That cold rainy day was the day I waited till they had all gone off'n the hill but the grave-diggers and when they was throwin over her some of the last dirt I watched them from behind the butt of that old chimney there in the blackberry vines  --  I was scrounched down there in that hole where the pot-hooks used to swing . And when one of the grave diggers said : Boys , since we 're so nearly done and the weather 's so rainy and cold , what 's you fellars say let 's slip down yander behind the bank and take a drink of licker ? Looks purty bad to drink here over this woman 's dead body and her a woman of God 's , but a little licker wo n't go a bit bad now . ' And they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank . While they was down over the bank I slipped out beside the grave and took a long-handled shovel , a corn scoop and a coal pick  --  I had this in mind when I hid if they ever left their tools . I wanted to see them throw the dirt in and I did n't want them to see me . I hid the tools in the butt of the chimney where I was hidin . And I said to myself , I 'll come back here a year from today and I 'll put new breath in her through the Faith in the Word . ' So , I got the tools . I hid them right here . I stayed with them . The boys could n't find their tools and they argued how funny it was their tools disappearedso suddenly , said it was such a strange thing . Some men accused the other men of not bringin their tools . They throwed in the rest of the dirt on my dead wife , then they swaggered full of licker off'n the hill . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it was a leaf blowed off'n that sweet-gum tree right over there . There was death in that leaf same as there was death in my wife .

She was a fine woman , was n't she ? " " Yes . My wife was a very fine woman . " " Brother Groan , I knowed your wife since you spoke about her . Your wife had a harelip , did n't she ? She was marked with a rabbit , was n't she ? " " Yes , Brother Redfern , my wife had a harelip . But she was n't marked with no rabbit . God put it there for the sins of her people . And my wife would n't let no Doctor sew it " p . My wife would say in church , God put this harelip 4m me for the sins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' My wife was a good woman . " " Brother Groan , I remember the woman with the harelip . And she was your wife ! Well , I saw her five summers ago , a tall woman slim as a bean pole with a harelip . I saw her in Puddle , West Virginia . She was in God 's house and she saidp136the words you said that she always said about her lip . And one thing she said has always stuck with me . It was somethin like this : A man swimmed out in the river with his two sons . He was a good swimmer and they tried to follow him . He led the way for them . One went under the water and never come up again . The father started back with his other son toward the river bank and under he went too to never come up again . My God Almighty , ' the father cried out , my sons are lost . They went the wrong way too far and I led them . I led them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night . And the sperit of God was there in that house . " " Brother Groan , I was in Venom , Kentucky , two summers ago and I saw your wife . She was in God 's house there . She had a harelip I remember and all her teeth nearly showed in front . They looked like awful long teeth . I remember when she was talkin to God she had a awful hard time sayin her words to God . She got up and said the words you said she said about her lip to the people , then she pulled her sleeve up and showed where she was marked on the arm by the belly of a sow . There was a patch of black sow-belly skin on her arm and thin sow-belly hairs scattered all over it . And there was three small sows ' teats about the size of a gilt sow 's teats . And your wife said : People , God has marked me because my people have sinned against God and I am to carry the marks of my sinnin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No Doctor can cut the one off'n my arm or sew the one up on my lip .

It has been three years ago this September . I saw her at a tent meetin at Beaverleg , Ohio . And I 'll die rememberin one good thing I heard your wife get up and say . She said : Women , if I had a man mean as the very Devil which I ai n't got , I would get up and cook for him at the blackest midnight . I would get a good warm meal for him if I had the grub to cook for him . Why ? Because where he is goin after he leaves this world there he wo n't have no sweet wife to cook for him .

It was September in a hayfield near Beaverleg , Ohio , where the tent of God was . Your wife was a good woman , was n't she ? " " Yes , my wife was a good woman , Brother Pigg . She was a good woman . You are goin to see my wife again . She is goin to walk off this hill with me . You bring the corn scoop here and shovel down through the loose dirt on top of the grave far down as you can shovel and lift out with the short-handle corn scoop . Here is the place . Start right here . Here is the place my wife was buried a year ago today . Yes , my wife was a good woman . " " Did you say to begin here , Brother Groan ? " " Yes , begin right there .

When the scoops of dirt hit the dirt pile , they are like so many dish rags hittin the kitchen floor . Dirt hits the dead weeds and the dead leaves on the ground in little thuds . The big moon is yellow above the dead dirty grass and the white tombstones and the rain-cloud gray tombstones . The Disciples are silent now except for the wet dirt piece-meal in the ground . Brother Fain Groan is whisperin to God . " I need the long-handle shovel ! " " Here is the shovel , Brother Pigg . Leave me dig a little while , Brother Pigg . Ai n't you about fagged out ?

She told the people she was n't ashamed of it . And I ai n't ashamed of it neither , thank God . God do n't heal this old clay temple of ours only through the Faith in the Word . I 'll put breath back in my dead wife 's body and she 'll become my livin wife again . My wife  --  you have seen my wife and you 'll know my wife when she is risen from the grave , Brother Sluss , and breathes the breath of life again . " Brother Groan walks out among the graves . His face is turned toward the stars . He whispers unknown syllables to the wind . The wind whispers unknown syllables to the weeds and to the dead leaves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A voice ! " " Yes . " " Ah ! " " The voice of God . " " No . " " It was the voice of the wind . " " Yes . " " The wind . " " The wind in the dead grass . " " Well then , did you hear the voice ? " " No . " " What did you hear ? " " I heard the wind in the grass . " " The wind ! " " Yes . The wind . The wind . " " You are gettin way down there , Brother Littlejohn . Let me spell you a little while with that shovel . " " All right , Brother Redfern . The ground is gettin hard here . Bring the coal pick down with you .

We 're bit and we ca n't go back . We 're goin to get sick in a few minutes . " " I thought I heard a voice . " " You did . " " Yes . Is it God 's voice ? " " No . It is the voice of Brother Groan . " " See him ! He has opened the bundle of clothes he brought . He is holdin up a woman 's dress he brought in the bundle of clothes he carried up here on the hill tonight .

The dress she looked so pretty in . Here is the hat she wore . It is a high-crowned black hat with a goose plume on the side . And here are the shoes she wore last .

" " I have hit the wood , men . It is the box . I 'll have to shovel the dirt from around the box so we can lift it out . I need hand holts . Wait till I clear some of the dirt away with my hands .

" " Ai n't you got no Faith in the Word , Brother Shinliver ? " " Yes , but Brother Littlejohn , we ai n't got no business messin with the dead .

Brother Pigg and Brother Redfern are gettin mighty sick . They were bitten by the first copperhead , the rusty-mouthed grave he-copperhead . Brother Redfern and Brother Pigg are down under the hill by the wire fence . They are wallowin on the weeds . They are sick enough to die . They have a very high fever , the arm of each man is swollen and numb . They do not know they are wallowin on the weeds in the graveyard , they know no more than the dead beneath them . Brother Groan comes up with the button shoes , the dress with the white dot , the black high-crowned hat with the white goose plume . Brother Fain Groan does not have a screw driver to take the coffin out of the box and the woman out of the coffin that the mountain of a man Brother Frazier lifted out of the grave hole alone .

Another heave and another heave , still another and another  --  offcomes the lid . " My God Almighty . My wife . My God ! My wife ! Oh my God , but it is my wife . Perfectly natural too ! My God ! Oh my God Almighty ! My wife ! " Brother Groan just wilts overp143like a tobacco leaf in the sun . He wilts beside his dead wife . She wilted one year ago .

Here is Brother Shinliver . He lies with his swollen leg propped upon the grave . He , too , is dead , dead as the dead under the ground  --  dead as Brother Groan ; dead as Brother Groan 's wife . Brother Pigg and Brother Redfern are lyin lifeless now ; lyin down beside the wire fence where one first comes into the graveyard . They were tryin to get home . They could n't get through four strands of barb wire stretched across the wind . They know no more than the grass beneath them ; the dead beneath them . There is vomit all around them on the grass and the dead and the half-dead weeds and the dead leaves . Brother Sluss and Brother Frazier leave the graveyard . They are afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the dead . They go down through the peach orchard , the corn patch , the pig lot and the cow pasture .

Or was that put-on do you suppose ? Was he in a trance or was he dead ? " " No , Brother Groan is dead . His heart stopped beatin and I suppose he is dead . I guess that kills the old clay temple when the heart stops beatin . " " I do n't believe Brother Groan had the right kind of Faith in the Word . " " Let your wife die  --  be dead a year .

See the pure natural bloom on her face at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black right before your eyes while the match is still burnin and you 'd forget all about the Faith in the Word . " " Yes , I saw that . I got sick too . I tell you it do n't pay to dig up the dead . The Word says the dead shall have their test . The Word says the dead die to rest , that they shall be buried deep enough to get their rest without bein bothered by cattle pickin grass from over them , wagons makin tracks ovcr them , men walkin over them . Then we go out and dig up Brother Groan 's wife . It is the Word that filled that grave with copperheads . The copperheads was put in there for a purpose when Brother Groan hid in that chimney butt and hid them tools in there that he stole from the grave diggers . We have worked against the Word .

It was that awful elk when the coffin was opened . I smelled somethin like mushrooms growin on an old log  --  a old sour log where the like-bellied water dogs sleep beneath the bark . " " Smelled like wild onions to me . " " I do n't believe that Brother Groan had the right kind of Faith .

The oak leaves swirl like clusters of blackbirds in the wind ; oak leaves , red , golden , scarlet  --  semi-golden oak leaves the color of one that stuck to the shovel handle last September . There is fire in the newp146September day . The wind is crisp to breathe . The tombstones gleam in the sun ; the wind has dried the dew off the weeds ; the wind has dried and half-dried the vomit on the leaves and the grass and the vomit that still sticks to the lips of the four senseless yet livin men that lie in the graveyard with the dead . The neighborhood is astir . They hunt for Fain Groan , Wilkes Redfern , Roch Shinliver , Cy Pigg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell where they are but they are ashamed . They slipped in at their back doors .

The neighborhood is astir . But Constable Ricks sees somethin from his house . He sees somethin goin on up at the graveyard . He has seen plenty of buzzards and crows workin on the carcasses of dead horses , but he has never seen such swarm in all his life as he now sees upon the hill at the graveyard . He sees crows sittin up in the wild-cherry tree ; enough of them sittin upon the limbs to break them off . There are the guard crows even . The ground is black with crows .

They change about crow habit , some guard while others eat . Constable Ricks starts for the Kale Nelson Graveyard . He is ridin a mule . He leaps the mule up the hill . He sees a pile of fresh dirt before he gets there , he sees somethin like a box on top of the ground , somethin like a man , somethin like a pile of clothes . Up to the graveyard and he sees . The crows fly up in a black cloud . The buzzards are very slow about it ,  | but they fly up too . He ties the mule to a fence post . One buzzard alights on the back of the mule and scares him .

When they scare the crows and the buzzards off Brother Groan and Brother Groan 's wife , they fly down at the lower end of the graveyard , they fly down to somethin on the ground . Many as can find a place alight on the fence posts . Constable Ricks runs down there and shoos them away and strikes the air at them as they fly with the long-handle shovel he picks up back at the grave . He finds four men on the ground and he finds plenty of sun-dried vomit on the leaves and on the dead weeds . Wilkes Redfern , Roch Shinliver , Cy Pigg , Lucas Littlejohn are lyin senseless on the ground . ConstableRicks thinks they are dead the way the crows are tryin to get to them and the way the buzzards are fightin back the crows from them . He goes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beatin . All hearts are beatin . The flesh of each man is cold . The warm September sun has not thoroughly thawed them after the cool night . " Found four men senseless but yet alive , Fred . Come down here . Let 's take care of the livin first . " Constable Ricks picks up a clod of dirt and he throws it at the crows with intent to kill . The clod goes through the whole flock of crows and does not touch a feather . Coroner Fred Stone stays with the dead and livin at the graveyard while Constable Ricks jumps on the mule and gallopsover the neighborhood to tell that he has found the missin men . Coroner Stone finds the rusty-mouthed copperhead , theshe-copperhead and the young copperhead . The snakes are dead , wilted and limber like a dead horse-weed in the sun . He knows the four men have been bitten by copperheads down under the hill by the wire fence where one first comes in thegraveyard when walkin up the path and not ridin a mule or bringin a team . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is black  --  black as a wilted pawpaw leaf . It has been picked on byp148the crows . But picked on is all . His face is old and tough . It is tough as crow meat . Brother Groan 's wife 's face is the color of a young blackberry sprout hit by a heavy October frost  --  wilted and soggy black . Her face has been picked on by the crows . Most of it is gone . Coroner Stone looks carefully at the dress with the white dot , the patent leather low-heeled button shoes , the black high-crowned hat with the white goose plume in the side . They are in Brother Groan 's left arm , his arm is wound around them like the short stubby body of a copperhead and his dead fingers clutch them like the copperhead 's fangs . Beforethe neighborhood gets back upon the hill and Constable Ricks comes with the spring wagon to haul the four senselessmen home , Coroner Stone holds his inquest : " Fain Groan committed suicide when he dug his wife up and looked at her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dig her up because here are the old clothes I used to see her wear . " That was Coroner Stone 's duty . When Constable Ricks comes upon the hill he arrests the dead man . He thinks that is his duty , for he does n't know much about the Law . He arrests him on the charge of " Public Indecency . " Then he says , " My duties have been faithfully performed within the sharp eyes ' of the Law . " The neighborhood men put Fain Groan 's wife back in the coffin and give her a second burial . They hang the copperheadson the fence wires , for they say it is a sign of rain to hang a dead snake on the fence . They throw the four men in the wagon , senseless but livin men , throw them in like four barrels of salt , throw in Brother Groan with his loose flowing robe like he was a shock of fodder with loose stalks danglin around the edges and they hurry them off the hill in the spring wagon . Quinn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims him too . Quinn Snodgrass is the brother of Fain Groan 's second wife , Fidas Campbell is the brother of Fain Groan 's first wife . His third wife did n't have a brother to claim him as it is the custom to be buried by the first wife and that is in keepin in accordance with the Word . But Quinn Snodgrass got the body of Fain Groan.  |p149It  was the first house beside the wagon road and the team pulled up and they carried his body in the house , though his dead body was still under arrest for Public Indecency . That day Quinn shaved the long beard from his face and cut his hair . He pulled the Christlike robe from his body and bathed his body in water heated in the wash kettle , put the mothcatchminister 's suit on him and prepared him for a nice clean burial . Out in the cow shed hammers and handsaws were kept busy all the time makin his coffin . The next mornin he was hauled in a jolt wagon with four boys a-sittin on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second wife , Symanthia Snodgrass . He was still under arrest for Public Indecency for diggin up his wife so the crows and the buzzardscould expose her parts . There was a quarrel between Beadie Redfern and Sibbie Frazier over Fain Groan 's wife 's clothes that were picked up et the grave upon the hill . Sibbie got the hat and shoes and Beadie got the dress . Men came and claimed the tools and thanked whoever found them . Tim Holmes claimed the longhandleshovel . Carlos Shelton claimed the corn scoop . Bridgetubers claimed the coal pick . All testified they had been missin since the day they buried Fain Groan 's wife the firstone , a year ago the day before . It is tough now to see Cy Pigg and Wilkes Redfern tryinplow with one arm . Looks like they both would make a od plowin team . Wilkes lost his left arm . Cy lost his right n . It is horrible to watch Lucas Littlejohn tryin to eat with one jaw . One can see his teeth grind the food and watch me of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ants to watch it . The Doctors could n't keep the flesh from ttin and fallin out though pokeberry roots and sweet milk id heal them . And there is Roch Shinliver , fat as mud , hoblinaround on a wooden leg . People knows his tracks by a big shoe track and a peg hole in the ground . His leg is all ere  --  the bone is there  --  it has never been taken off where the sh rotted from the copperhead bite and the muscles rotted d left the white bone.  |p150FRONNIE  goes to the door . She stops suddenly , turns her head and begins to cry . " Pap is dyin . My God , Pap is dyin . " There is old Battle Keaton . See him lying there on the bed . See him lying there  --  his face cold and white  --  white as a frost-bitten beech leaf is white when the sun comes out in September . His white face upturned to the low plank loft where spider webs hang filled with the skeletons of dead flies . Battle 's eye sockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sockets are like dead chunks of blackoakwood floating on the muddy water in these pools . There he lies  --  see him ! Old Battle Keaton ! The frizzly long slim beard on his chin and the flat slabs on his jaws is like the pine needles , like the bull grass too in the walls of a crow 's nest . It is frizzled up , this long white beard of old Battle Keaton 's , and a mouse could hide in it . Mice could make a nest in it . The wind comes through the window on the northeast side of the bed and it plays with Battle 's white crow-nest beard . It bends down a slim beard and then it lifts it up again . The wind does this . And it nibbles like a mouse at the upturned corner of a sheet . One ca n't see the wind , but one knows it is the wind . And the oak-chunk eyes of old Battle Keaton 's , now frozen in the muddy pool eye sockets , are fixed on the spider webs hanging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house . " Come here , Fronnie ! Come here , Fronnie . I said , come here Fronnie ! Fotch me a snip of water so I can wet my parchin tongue . It is dry and hot as a pile of sand in July . I ca n't get the words off my tongue . They hang to my dry tongue , God knows how they hang to my dry tongue . " Fronnie gets the gourd dipper of water from the zinc bucket , she takes down the long-handled gourd dipper with the double-black stripe running around the big end of the gourd . There are two gourd dippers at the water bucket and Fronnie gets the long-handleddipper . She dips the gourd into the zinc bucket and lifts the water in the dipper to Battle 's decayed potato-hole mouthp151and holds the dipper so he can drink . Battle Keaton sip-sips and he sip-sips and sip-sips the water from the gourd . And more water than old Battle drinks from the gourd is now falling , warm water , though , it is and not fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of Fronnie Bradberry . " Feel any better now , Pap ? " " Yes , I feel better . I mean I feel some better . I feel some better , but I do n't feel nigh right yet . I do n't feel at myself  --  not nigh at myself . I feel like a baby with little pink hands  --  with fingers you can move around just like fishin worms . That water did n't get all the way down . That water lodged like a lot of green apples in my windpipe and I can feel every lump of that water . I wish you 'd take a stick and punch it on down so I could get some wind down my windpipe . Give me another swatter of that water and I want to tell you somethin . " Fronnie dips the gourd into the zinc bucket  --  she carries the water to Battle . And this is water from the well that Battle found the vein of , water far underground , with his magic peach-tree forked branch  --  and for twenty years his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip-sips the water  --  sip-sips and gurgles the water down like water falling over tiny rocks where the ferns have their drooping heads stuck into the water . Battle has sip-sipped the water now . Water for thirst . Water to make words . " That water shoved that other water on down and now I have some room to get wind down my windpipe . Wind gives me wind to make words for you to speak to you and tell you , Fronnie , my baby girl , what I want to tell to you . Water clears up my windpipe and water wets my tongue so the words wo n't stick to the end of my tongue . Words pile up on the end of my tongue like dry chunks when I 'm cuttin off the sweet-tater ground and pilin up dry chunks in the spring o ' the year . But I can talk . My tongue is slick as a meat skin . " " Pap , do n't you feel any better ? Can you see the loft right above your eyes ? Wait . Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the dark eyes set in the dark pools . She waves her hand above the dark-chunk eyes and under the loft . And Battle says : " Yes , I can see your hand . What do youp152think my eyes are anyway , things to see out'n of , and ca n't see with ? What do you think my eyes are for , to eat with ? Askin me if I can see your hand and it 's as plain to me as daylight is plain to me ! Then you ask me . My God Almighty , Fronnie  --  and you ask me ! Do you think I am half-way dead , or whole-way dead , or what ? " " No , Pap . I just did n't know about your eyes . " " Well , I know about my own eyes . I can see the planks in the loft with my eyes good as I could see them when I was a young man . See . There is a pine plank by a chestnut plank and a poplar plank on tother side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , before I ever went to Flint County . I never was , and will never be satisfied with that piece of work I done . Every day after I walk to the wood yard and hobble on that old sour-wood cane  --  I come back in here and take my rest on this bed and I lay here and look up there at that loft and wonder just why I put down a pine plank between a chestnut plank and a poplar plank . " " Can you see them planks like that ? " " W'y , Fronnie , I lay here and I watch that old stripedbackedspider up there on the loft  --  she has stripes down her back just like the stripes on the big end of the water gourd . I watch that old spider day in and day out . I watch her when I come in after I walk to the chipyard every day . That old spider is allus out there next to that chestnut knot hole . I watch her spin her web and trap her grub . And then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she catches a fly and if she catches a hornet she do n't suck his blood right then but she just holds him there and starves him down first . But that old spider catches the flies . Look up there at the bones of the dead flies . After she drinks the blood of the fly the body of the fly gets dry as powder . I guess after it gets dry it crumbles up in dust and the dust of the dead flies fall down here on my bed and I wallow in the dead dust of so many flies . That 's what I been thinkin about here lately . Well , I lay here and I think I can reach up there and get that old she-striped-back spider sometimes . I want to cut its guts out with a knife . I want to crush that spider between my thumb and my indexp153gcr so bad I can taste it . God knows I ai n't got no use for damn fly , but I ca n't stand to see them lay up there in them cbs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here on thisd and I ca n't lift my arm sometimes to reach for that spider . y arm is too heavy for me to lift to the loft . And I think of old Tid Coons who used to run a sawmill and work his men even hours for a dollar and ten cents a day . He was a stripedbackedspider like that one up there on the wall . " " Pap , do n't you want some more water ? " " Not now . I 'm tellin you , Fronnie , about old Tid Coons. and old Tid took the blood out'n twelve men instead ofclue flies . Old Tid is dead and gone now and he did n't take is money with him . His children is runnin through with his money  --  runnin through with the blood he sucked out'n us . But he was a spider spinnin webs from one hilltop to another hilltop  --  just so that they had timber on them . The words are angin to my tongue and I got a lot of things I want to tell you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haystack and there is just as many words there as there is straws in a haystack . Bring me some water , Fronnie  --  words hangin to my tongue and I ca n't get them off without water . I feel like a little baby with pink fingers and little mouse-paw hands . " Fronnie holds the long-handled gourd to Battle 's lips  --  lips arched , dark like a hole black and chipped around the edges In a sound Irish potato . Battle sips and he tastes his tongue ande tastes his lips . And he tastes again and he sips-in water into is potato-hole mouth , water the color of thin air , water sweet to taste  --  sweet as the thin petal of a blackberry blossom . Battle tastes again and he tastes his lips and his tongue  --  his tongue , blue-looking and thick like the tongue of a calf , comes out of his mouth and feels for water and slips back like a mouse goinginto a little dark hole . He tastes again and again he tastes and he swallows . And he hunts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a hole afraid of a cat and looks around for water the color of thin air . " Ai n't you goin to take me out on the porch , Fronnie , since the day has got up and you got the dinner dishes cleaned and put away ? Take me out there , and put me out there on that 54bed on the porch . I ca n't stand to look at them planks up there in that loft and that spider any longer . I want to feel the sun again and let it shine on my face . I want to feel the wind on my face . I want my eyes turned to the cornfield where Snider is plowin . I want to watch the corn grow . I want to take a stalk of corn in my hand and squeeze the growin green juice out'n it . I like to watch Snider plow the mule and Vicey cut the high weeds behind the plow . " " Pap , I ca n't take you out there by myself . Wait till I call Snider and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she calls , " Snider ! 0 Snider ! Come here , Snider . " And Snider says , " Yeh  --  whoa ! Yehwhoa ! What do you want , Ma ? " " You and Vicey come ' ere and help me move Pap . He ai n't a-restin well . " " All right , Ma . But when a body 's workin that 's the way you do . Stop him . Call him right in out'n the field , to milk a cow , cut some wood and move Grandpa . " Snider ties the mule to a splintered stump . Vicey goes ahead  --  she is running , her brown , moving legs cut through the wind . She goes through the four-stand rusted barb-wire fence  --  into the pasture and down a bank  --  steep , daisy-covered  --  up the hill then under the blooming locust trees  --  and then to the house . Snider walks slowly under the stalks of green corn , head-high , and over the head slightly , and corn twice headhigh . Snider walks slowly , his big bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground like a soft windbloatedbullfrog mashed down , pressed flatly on the ground . When Snider turned this ground for corn , his father Sweetbirdwalked between the plow handles . Snider drove the mules  --  and he wore a shoe on the foot near the mules . Snider 's feet are scaly  --  a heavy skin to protect his blood from the cold of March and April . " Come in here , Snider , you and Vicey , and help me carry Pap to the porch and put him on that half-bed out there . Pap ai n't feelin nigh right . He wants to talk all the time . And he 's been drinkin water and talkin all mornin . " " I know Grandpa . He wants to get out here on this porch where he can look over there and count the rows of corn Ip155plow . Then when Pa conies in he 'll tell Pa and you know Pa will cuss the top of the house off if I ai n't done a big day 's work . Grandpa 's got eyes like a buzzard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He can see that hill over there and almost count the cornstalks . He can if the sun do n't get in his eyes . He ai n't sick as he lets on . He wants to tell Pa I am lazy and have Pa jumpin all over me when Pa comes in from  --  rubbin . Now Ma , that 's what Grandpa wants . Everytime Iclp put him on that porch I have to fuss with Pa that night  --  vcr how much plowin I done that day . You know how heat me up that night Bud Timberlake drunk that pizen lickerd come home and driv that little lamb off'n the hill and cutthroat with a butcher knife . You remember that night , o n't you ? " " Your Grandpa is childish . He is gettin so much like a baby . Your Grandpa is old . He is very sick . You must pethim like he was a baby with little pink toes and little pink ands . He has been a hard-workin man . He used to do as much work as two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch people work . " " But I do n't want to work like Grandpa . Look at his hands there , wo n't you ? They look like a bear 's claws  --  Look atthem . If I 'd take my shirt off and drag it across Grandpa 's ands it would hang up on his rough hands and the shirt could tear . I do n't want hands like Grandpa 's . " " Your Grandpa is awful sick . He says words hang on his .. ngue . He asts me to give him water so he can moisten his ' 0 ngue and talk to me . Your Grandpa is awful sick . " " Awful sick . " " Yes . Said he felt like a baby with pink hands . Come to the . or . Look through there at Pap . See how pale Pap is . His cc is white as the burnt-out dirt around the wash kettle . All c blood in it has been burnt out . All the color in it has been burnt out . And Pap has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death on the hills of Flint County . He has t so much timber there and he has cut timber all over these Is too . He has helped to build nearly all the roads in this ' Linty and in Flint County and he has helped to build thep156railroad bed for the Big Sandy Railroad . He has worked like a brute since he was a little boy . His life has about burnt out'n his temple of clay  --  nearly stone deef too . Be of mind and do n't say nothin loud enough for him to hear you  --  it will hurt his feelins . He 's like a baby with pink hands . " " Mama , is Grandpa bad-off ? " " Yes , Vicey . Your Grandpa is sick enough to die . He ai n't likely to get over it . He is likely to die , your Grandpa is . " " Poor Grandpa . " " Come on , Snider . Let 's make a saddle pocket with our arms and slip it right under Pap 's head and shoulders and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put one under each arm and we can carry him out here on the porch . You can tail him to the bed that way , ca n't you , Vicey ? " " Yes , Mama . " " Just pull the covers down . He 's got on his shirt and his long drawers . He 's dressed all right --  " " How do you make a saddle pocket with your arms , Ma ? " " Do n't you know how to make a saddle pocket , much as you 've carried the little girls around ? " " No . " " Hold your right arm out straight . Catch your right arm with your left at the wrist . Grip it tight . I 'll do the same . Like this , see . Yes , you have done it right . Now catch my left arm with your right hand and grip it tight and I 'll catch your left arm with my right hand and grip it tight . Now let 's put our arms right under Pap 's head and slip them down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed , Vicey , and pull the cover down and get between Pap 's legs . Put a leg under each arm and follow us . Vicey , shove us just a little . Pap is heavy . Pap will weigh two-hundred pounds . " Under the door they go from the front room , through the dining-room , thence the partition door to the kitchen , then out on the back porch . Now they lay Battle carefully on the bed . And now they fix his eyes toward the cornfield and the sun . There is a little valley between , a fence , a daisy field , four barb-wires and some wind . " Yes , I know how Pa is and how Grandpa is. "  |p157Snider  and Vicey cross the valley and up through the daisiesthe pasture hill , through the four strands of barb wire pled tightly and stretched loosely to knotty black-locust posts  --  through the wind into the cornfield . Snider unhitchesc mule from the splintered stump , he puts the rope lines ound his shoulders , he steps between the handles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt bensto crumble around the green stalks of corn  --  moist dirt , . i1 , soft to the big mushroom feet of Snider Bradberry. key picks up the goose-neck hoe . And she lifts it higher  --  an her shoulder and she cuts the sour-wood sprouts . She relics for a snake  --  a copperhead  --  Vicey is afraid of the copperhead . Stumps are low black things in the cornfields . They are cd-off blocks of dead men  --  dead-men trees . Once they re living things . They were living things drinking windto their leaves  --  drinking rain and ground water into their  --  lies . But now they are dead . Green corn is pretty , sprung rn the roots  --  green corn in the thin blue air  --  air thin and tty as running mountain water . Roots that ran deep intoloamy earth are now a rotted bit of wood  --  color of tobacco-stain under the earth where the dirt is moist and cool . We Keaton is an almost dead oak root lost in the loam ofearth . Battle looks toward the cornfield . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porch . His darker black-chunk eyesfrozen glass in the muddy pool of eye sockets  --  frozenand glued on the field of green waving corn  --  corn so pretty t before tasseling time  --  just before the last plowing . He tints the time in minutes it takes Snider to drive the mule ound to the drain at the west end of the field and turn d come back in a row of corn . He counts the furrows Snider ales . And he thinks , " Ah , well , young men today do n't work like they did when I was a boy . Men today ai n't what y used to be . " Battle sees little Vicey 's hoe gleaming insun when she lifts it above her shoulder to cut a blackustsprout . Battle Keaton says , " The sunlight is so good to I. The sunlight is good to me . I love the sunlight . I alwaysp158loved the sunlight . I love the wind . The wind is cool on my windpipe . The wind is good to breathe . I can taste the wind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plow a round around out there to that drain . I wish I had some new parts and I 'd be all right . I need a new set of legs and then I could beat that boy over there a-plowin . I could walk to the wood yard without a cane . If I could n't beat that boy over there a-plowin I 'd quit . I 'd do more in one day than he does in three . I aim to tell his Pa this very night that he ai n't doin all the work he can or all the work he orta do . But he is like his Pa and his Pa 's people . He ai n't like his Ma Fronnie and my people . " Shadows shift in the cornfield  --  shadows shift and sunlight dances on the green cornblades like little mice playing hideand-go-seekin dead fodder blades . Shadows shift  --  those just a little broader than a blade of corn . They swerve as the wind bends the stalks of green corn . Battle can see the cornstalks bend over and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't smell the green corn in the wind flavored with the scent of pussley and he ca n't breathe again that sweet hot scent of wind from the cornfield and feel the dry-hot , soft-plowed dirt beneath his feet , the rope lines around his broad shoulders and his hands on the hickory handles of the plow with a whoa-whoa and gee-haw in his mouth . Battle is now a living mass of pale dirt  --  a temple of clay , the color of clay , where the fire has burned it around the edges of the wash kettle . Color has been sucked from , blood has been sucked from , his temple of clay  --  Time has sucked his blood and his color  --  Time is a spider catching flies in a little thin web on the low sky roof of earth house . Time is going to leave Battle a skeleton  --  his clay , burned dry is going to crumble and leave his bones  --  a naked tree so the wind can pass between his ribs and sizzle like his last breath will sizzle in his passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mule go and come . He sees the mule and he loves to watch the mule step over the stumps and the rocks . He sees the sun , the bright , living sun  --  he sees the sun with glassy-fixed eyes  --  he sees the sun pretty and golden in the sky , shine down through the airp159as water in a mountain stream . He sees the pretty , green , ng , growing corn and the moist dirt thrown up at its roots c can see it  --  he has eyes like a buzzard . Age has brought eyes to seeing distant . He sees the slender weeds growingdancing in the sun and throwing up wind-bent arms to  --  sun . And Battle says : " Oh , if I had only two good legs . 1x my legs . They ai n't got no power no more than broom ws . They 're what 's holdin me back  --  my legs . If I was just young again and had life to live over I 'd make it different .

" Green corn growing and pretty wind blowing I cows feeding on the green grass  --  feeding green grass over , the side of creek waters under the locust shades . Bees . king on the bean blossoms in the cornfield beans and suck  --  on the summer cedar tops and the sweet-gum berries . Why love life ? Life in this summer season  --  so feather light , soso energetic  --  roots going down into the earth and blossomswaving on long stems from the earth  --  up , up , skyward the pretty wind .

Your blood has been drunk back the earth and all the color and heat there was in your body been drunk back by the earth . " Here is more water , Pap . Here , Pap . Here , just another little sip . " Slowly he sip-sips the color of wind water . Slowly . Slowly . ow he sip-sips . He can not raise his hand to the gourd . Hisd is heavy , but words will be light now . They will come cr from his tongue . His tongue wo n't try to hold his words . sips-sips slowly the color-of-wind well water . " There is a sheet of darkness before me . You take your d , Fronnie , and pick up this black sheet and take it up/stairs and put it on the quilt stack .

Come here , I want to tell you somethin , Fronnie . A spider has got me in a web and got my blood . My blood is gone , I knowed my blood was gone last night when I went back -- I went back last night , Fronnie . " " Went back where , Pap  --  where did you go ? " " I went back over there on the Runyan Hill where Daid is buried . I went over there by her grave and I set down there and stayed a long time . And I thought of the day when Pete Lennix hauled her up there in the express with that old pair of grays he used to drive . After I set by the side of her grave I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was back out there on the ridge where we used to work that piece of corn together  --  outthere at Pine Flat cornfield . You remember , Fronnie  --  you'sa little girl when me and Daid tended that piece of corn . Well , I went back there last night and looked at the old furrow ridges under the briars and sprouts . The briars has just about took that hill  --  the saw-briars and the greenbriers . The pines are as big as a body 's thigh  --  and the oaks are short and dumpy  --  the way old , poor , worn-out land makes them  --  short , dumpy and tough as leather . I want to tell you , Fronnie , that is the place I want to be buried  --  right over there by Daid . I want to have the briars cut out and the sprouts  --  a place big enough to dig a grave to put me in . That place is growed up an awful lot but I want to be buried there . " Words Fronnie can not say : " Pap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dyin . His hands are turnin purple above his wrists like frost-bitten pawpaw leaves turn purple . His hands have shriveled like the branches of a tough-butted white oak cut and left to bleed . His hands are purple . The tough skin has begun to shrivel and turn purple . He was not back over there at that old graveyard last night unless it was his sperit that went back over there . Pap was right here in bed .

They run like crystal beads down her leafcoloredcheeks ( autumn leaf-colored from working in the sun- , t in the cornfields ) and the beads drip to the dusty ground ere the crystal is lost , lost in the dust . Fronnie wipes hers with her apron and she calls : " Snider , you and Vicey Ic here . Come here , Snider , you and Vicey . Pap is dyin.  --  is shore dyin . " Snider brings the mule and Vicey brings hoe . Snider rides on the mule 's back and puts his big baret upon the trace chains and he holds to the hames with hisp164hands .

He is dyin by degrees . " " Yes , Grandpa is dyin . He is dyin by degrees like the cat did when it swallowed the mattock . " Snider jumps on the back of the mule . He clutches the hames with his big hands and he puts his big bare feet on the rusty trace chains  --  puts them right where the back band goes over the mule 's back and the bellybandgoes under the mule 's belly . Snider starts the mule in a mule lope . " Where are you goin , Snider ? " " Goin over to the flat after Pa . He 's grubbin over there yet . Be back in just a few minutes . " " Water , Fronnie .

Here comes the mule in a full lope . The mule is carrying double . Sweetbird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding behind . Snider is holding to his Pa 's overall suspenders  --  here they come round past the pig lot  --  full speed ,  |p165mule  speed , they come . Under the poplar trees where green leaves flutter and the wind oozes through the green smooth leaves with the slick-soap sides . The wind oozes and the mule lopes  --  the pigs grunt and run to the trough for slop  --  through the barn lot the mule lopes . It is getting its breath hard . The mules sides work in and out like a bee smoker . But it goes full speed into the yard  --  Sweetbird and Snider roll off and run into the house and then to the back porch where Battle is silent  --  silent as death . " Good-by , Fronnie . Good-by , Sweetbird , I 'm gone . Shadow around me . See , Fronnie , that when I 'm buried I 'm put away just like I was goin to bed . Good-by . " I fear the sharp sizzle of wind  --  wind that sizzles like wind conning out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind that Battle draws . It is a sharp sizzle of wind and it goes like wind pressed in a vise , if wind could be pressed in a vise . It is wind come out where the walls fall in . It is wind that if it could speak would say , " Wind has come in here and gone out for the last eighty-four years  --  but now the wind time is over and past . " Battle has died on his back , too  --  Fronnie turned him over when his breath came hard and the veil came becenhis eyes and the sun . Battle turned over on his back  --  t die like a copperhead fighting a forest fire turns on its back to die . The thin white beard on his face bends down when the wind blows , but when the wind stops the beard rises again . The wind blows over the pale face and then it blows on to the cornfield where there is life in the green corn . And it kisses , the green blades of living corn  --  kisses the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It blows off the soft , downy bard of Battle 's then onto the green weeds dancing with joy tinder the setting sun  --  weeds so full of life  --  green weeds withoutform dancing under the July sun  --  dancing for the wind . Fronnie is crying . More water comes from her eyes than the last sip-sips Battle took . Fronnie is afraid . She puts her arms around Sweetbird . Now she takes her arms from around Sweetbird 's shoulders and she goes to the wall and leans against the wall to cry . " The last water Pap drunk as a mortal man . The last water . Poor Pap . Gone . A hard-workin man for usp166children . He slaved like a dog to raise us . Went through thick and thin . And now . I ca n't stand it , Sweetbird .

He hated to die so . He was n't afraid . Not even afraid of the stain of death . No , Pap was n't afraid . " " I 've liked old Dad better than if he was my own Dad , and you know it . Nothin on this earth I would n't do for Dad . You know that , Fronnie . Been on many a spree with Dad before the Lord took him on His side of the fence . Had many a good hunt with him . Poor old Dad . God knows I hate to see Dad go . " " I remember when Mother died how he used to cut timber for twenty-five cents a day and how us children farmed at home . How we worked and God knows we did n't have enough to eat in the house . We 'd go get apples off a little tree beside the road  --  did n't belong to nobody  --  we 'd get apples there enough to fry for breakfast  --  we had a cow and she made butter enough to go with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what biscuits was . Corn bread for three meals a day . Pap raised us all without a blemish on our characters . Now death has to take him . " And here he lies . Two hundred pounds of man once  --  now two hundred pounds of clay from a burned-out temple that men called his body before death . He was a man of brute strength . He worked all of his life like a brute . And what about the future ? Did he save for the future ? Why did he die with Fronnie and her man Sweetbird ? " How can you put corn in a crib and keep it twenty years ? You pintly ca n't do it . The mice will heart it . The mice will eat the hearts first , then they 'll go to eatin the meal of the corn . How can you put away molasses in barrels and keep it twenty years ? It turns to sugar like sweet grains of sand  --  coarse to eat and not molassesand not sugar . That 's what I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't keep it forever and I 'll get old atter a while.  |p167Twenty  years is a long time to keep corn against the mice and the wind  --  twenty years of a man 's life is a long time . " Fronnie says : " I 'll see that Pap is not buried by my mother or his third wife  --  that old woman where strangers are buried by her side and then to bury Pap there amongst strangers . I 'll see he 's buried by Daid , my stepmother , on the Runyan Hill . Daid was so good to Pap and they got along so well . " " Fronnie , you know the only two things I ever had agin your Pap ? " " No , Sweetbird . " " Well , Dad was such a strong Democrat he stunk . And before the Lord got him on His side of the fence , he could just put more good licker down him than I could .

He could just pintly put ' er all over me when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days ago you 's the only Republican he ever voted fer in his life  --  said he voted fer you when you run fer trustee . I 'll see that Pap is give a nice burial . I 'll see he ai n't laid to rest by that third woman . A woman afraid to cross the river . Said she was afraid of a bridge . I 'll see that Pap is buried in his shirt and drawers without a necktie just as he wanted to be buried on the Runyan Hill . I 'll see his coffin is made of black-oak planks with a wild-cherry lid . " The sun is red behind the mountain . The wind stirs the green July corn . The wind sings a song in the July corn  --  and on the low-loft the spider spins a web  --  the fly goes in . The spider jumps on the fly and the spider drinks the blood . The fly works its legs slower and slower . Tomorrow , fly-dust will fall down on the bed where Battle used to sleep and dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  how he kicked like a dying fly , but time took back his blood and gave it to the cornfields and his hills  --  his hills  --  and now time would slowly disintegrate his burned-out clay to mix forever with the elements . Fronnie goes into the back room , the room used by visitorsonly , and she puts a clean sheet on the big wooden bed  --  the bed Battle and Pansy slept on their bridal night sixty-four years ago . Fronnie carries the dirty sheets upstairs , and the quilts , and she puts them on the stack by the chimney  --  the chim/ney that runs like a big white weed stem through the middle of the house . " Ready now to bring him in , " says Fronnie . " Ready now to bring Pap in and put him on the wooden bed in the back room . Come and help , Sweetbird . " Sweetbird and Fronnie make a saddle pocket and they slip their knots of arms down under Battle 's shoulders  --  no use to put their arms under his head too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drag Battle from the bed on the porch , thence through the partition door , thence through the dining-room , front room , and then the back room . His heels dragging on the floor turn up the corners of the rag rugs . They put half of him on the big wooden bed . Then they lift his dead legs onto the bed . Now his whole body lies on the clean sheet . Fronnie goes and gets another sheet and spreads it over Battle  --  puts two pennies on his eyes to make them close . Now Battle lies . You can not see him for the four corners of a room . It is hard to see through logs . But a spider on the low loft above sees Battle  --  a mouse comes through the newspaperpaperedwall , preens his nose  --  he too sees Battle . Fronnie and Sweetbird see Battle . The sun sees through the windowpanes and a glimmer of dying sunlight falls on the **25;3394;TOOLONG . Battle 's beard , tall , slim , white-as-it-is beard , not white as the sheets though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windowpanes and one hole where a windowpane used to be . Battle 's beard is white as a leaf-stained hen egg . Battle 's beard would be white , but it has tobacco stain down near the roots of it and fresh tobacco stain on the ends of some of it , and the sun makes the tobaccostainedbeard gleam reddening gleams in the sunrays . But there Battle lies  --  on a bed big enough to hold him , in a house he+ built with his own hands big enough to hold him in life and to hold him in death . There he lies on a big wooden bed . He has only gone to bed for a last long sleep . Only , Battle Keaton is a silent man and no one knows if he dreams of the ax and the saw and the cornfields where the brush grow now , where the crows fly over and where the old furrows of twenty years ago are like little potato ridges in a sandy bottom . Battle Keaton is silent . Silent . He does not heave up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind . When the wind sizzled from his nostrils after his chest last heaved , then it grew forever still and the walls of the earth-house were ready to cave in . The setting sun gives its last rays for the day to Battle for his last time to feel the sun  --  sun on his cold , silent , burned-out clay . Life . Life . " Get on the mule , Snider , and go tell the neighbors Pap is dead . Go up Turkey Creek and down Hog Branch and over on Buzzard Roost . Let ' em all know Pap is dead but the Turners . You know how vile the Turners is and how Pap hates them all since they killed Pap 's cousin that foul way that time .

I want him to ride the mule he left stand in the barn lot all day  --  that mule that is well rested . You know how a boy is . Do n't know how much a brute can stand . " " All right , better hurry . Snider gets in a hurry when they ai n't no work , nothin but jantin round all over the country . You 'd better hurry if you want Snider . " " Oh , Snider !

" Snider rides the mule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tall skinny as wild onion sitting on a little saddle that his end covers till nothing is seen but the spur of the saddle running up his backbone . His big bare feet dangle as the mule gallops away from the barn  --  the bridle reins are flung loosely in the wind  --  the mule and the rider are free-free  --  free down among the stumps , the corn now . Up the toe-path through the corn , across the hill and onto the ridge that leads to Turkey Creek . There he goes . See Snider between you and the sun and how he covers the saddle  --  his long legs dangle nearly to the ground . The mule still gallops . " Uncle Eif , come over tonight to the settin-up . Grandpa 's dead . " " Old Battle Keaton dead ! What ! Old Battle Keaton dead . Well I 'll be dogged . When did he die ? " " Died this evenin at two o'clock . " " Old Battle Keaton 's dead , Till .

Old age . Grandpa kept complainin around and said all he needed was new legs . " " But legs do n't help a man when the Lord calls him .

Your days are numbered and when you live that number out , all the Doctor 's medicine and the Doctors and new legs in this world ai n't goin to save you , son . Are you a Christian ? Are you a saved man ? " " Hell no . I ai n't no saved man . " Snider rides the mule away at full gallop . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweat has made the hair wet and stick to the mule 's skin . Snider 's pants are sweaty at the seat . They stick to the little brown-butter-colored saddle  --  bright leather , old , but well taken-care-of leather . Snider goes through the Turkey Creek country and tells the neighbors . He tells everybody but the Turners : " Grandpa is dead . Pa said tell you to come over to the settin-up tonight . " Snider crosses the Pine Hill and over onto Hog Branch . The moon is out now . The moon is pretty , shining down through the pines on Pine Hill . The moon hangs like a smattering of bright-colored apple butter in the water-colored sky  --  a washed-in moon it was  --  washed in the color of bright-coloredapple butter . See the moon hanging above hills in the blue soft velvetiness in northeast Kentucky . See ! the moon is very pretty in this softness . It is under this moon Snider rides  --  right out in the pretty life that Battle loved  --  the life Battle fought for , fought Death for like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , full of life and living would love . Here is where Battle has lived all of his eighty-four years . It was here where Battle chose to live , and where Battle chose to die . It was here where the oaks grow stubborn and not so tall  --  where the land is thin and where the brush grows stubbornly on the rocky tall hills . These hills gave Battle nourishment for his tough flesh . Such pretty night and Snider rides to tell about the death of one clay temple , charred white by living  --  by the fire of living . Up the toe-paths , across creeks and through the paling gates where yard apple trees loom ghostly shadows in front of unlockeddoors  --  doors to log houses where men and women sit resting in front of them on the stone doorsteps and in chairs . They sit resting from a hard day in the cornfields . Sweaty and tired they sit and listen to the whippoorwill calling far over across the green cornfield to his mate sitting on their front-yard gate . Snider walks up each path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biting dogs . He says Grandpa died this evening at two o'clock and Ma and Pa wants you to come over to the setting-up tonight if it ai n't too late for you to stir . Bring some hymn books if you 've got any.  | Under the muddle of smiling autumn dead-leaf moon , from under the tangles of green yard trees , Snider creeps back to his mule  --  silent , stealthy and on the watch he creeps . Then he leaps to the butter-colored saddle and away to another house . And here where looms a path of high oak trees , poplars , pines , here where logs were stacked together forty-six years ago to build a house  --  Here where all is silent save the throbs from Fronnie and the grunting of hungry pigs and the moomoosof unmilked cows  --  here are voices . Here comes a long line of people following the toe-path up the hill . The leader has a lantern in the moonlight . The lantern guides his brogan footstepsbetween high rims of ragweeds alongside the toe-path . Under the bright July stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind is whispering to the corn  --  they come . Up the hill , up the hill  --  slowly , along  --  they come . Women follow their husbands up the hill  --  follow the men in overalls and blue shirts covered with overall jumpers to keep back the July night wind from the sweaty shirts  --  made wet by following the plow . Women wearing their threadbare shawls and smoking their claystonepipes . " Come in you folks and get you some chears . Just set any place you can find a seat and any place it 's handier to you .. i low are you , Della , you and Sweeter and Linda ? " " I 'm purty good , Fronnie . A little bit tired though  --  worked like a dog today . Got that swamp piece of bottom ground worked out and it nearly worked us all to death to do it  --  took all hands and the cook too . " " I 'm tired too . Been workin in new ground all day . " " I stuck pole beans today till my back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm tired enough to stretch right down there on that hard floor and go to sleep . " " Fronnie , we are awful hurt about your Pap dyin . We just could n't believe it was the Lord 's will  --  good a man as Battle Keaton ought to be spared a few more years here on this old earth of trouble and sorrow . But guess that 's why the Lord 's kept him all these eighty-four years . Kept him till he did see the light . "  | " Yes . It must have been the Lord 's will to keep him till he got on the side the light was on . " " Yes . My Pap was a good man if there ever was a good man on this earth . You know Pap quit his drinkin two years ago . He jined the church and got right with God . He used to stay with me and Sweetbird after Daid died and Pap was sorty weaked . He 'd drink licker with Sweetbird and they 'd work hard all day  --  drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair begin to turn , Pap saw he was goin down yon side of the hill toward the settin sun . It was the time Finn Fultz from Flint County heft that protracted meetin over on Hog Branch in the schoolhouse that Pap come across with the Lord and got on the right side . Sick as he got before he died , suffered the way he did , when Sweetbird offered him licker a week ago this very night Pap said , I 'll see Death starin me in the face before I 'll drink that weaked water . ' " And Pap died with that kind of faith . I ai n't a bit uneasy tonight that Pap is a angel in Heaven and right in this room lookin at us mortals in this world of trials , tribulations and sorrows . Pap 's with my mother this very night and maybe with his second wife Daid . He 'll see my little sister that 's dead . Pap is a angel in Heaven tonight though his old temple of clay is right over there wrapped up in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Branch when Battle got saved . I went up in the same altar call and was saved at the same time Battle Keaton was . I remember how Brother Finn Fultz prayed with us till after midnight and how Brother Battle come through and he 'd jist come through and I saw the light  --  Yes , I remember well as if it had been yisterday . " " I knowed Battle Keaton when he was a young man and out in sin . We growed up together . He was the best ball player and tree climber I ever did see when he was a boy . When he jumped the broomstick with Pansy McClintlock I was right there . I slipped in where he was to sleep that night and helped to tie the cow bells to the bed slats . Been a long time agog folks , but I remember well as if it had been yisterday . Fronnie , I remember when you was born  --  you first saw light on that big wooden bed where Battle lays a corpse . Your mother and your father first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through life . I am a old man now . My hair is white . I am goin down the side of the hill Battle has just went down . " I saw him go through life  --  full of life when he was a young man , powerful and big all his days . A big man . A good into . I remember him  --  yes . Yes . I remember him . Now I see hint over there in death . Birth . Life . Life . Life . Slowin down . I ben Death . Ai n't it all a funny thing . We are just as the Word ' says . We are put here for God 's purposes . He wants us t obey . I know God cries when one of us goes wrong . It is all the will of the Lord . " " Yes , Alec , God hates to see us go wrong . We have our seasonsjust like a flower . That leetle baby over there with the pink hands and the pink tender lips is a leetle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? All she knows now is to suck milk from her mother 's breast . She 'll soon blossom into her youth and be a flower and know about life . There pointing to Snider is the young man  --  carefree . Does n't care if it snows oats . He is in the very blossom of his youth . It is the spring of his season . " Here is Fronnie in the summer of her life  --  here is Fronnie giving birth to a brood and workin for her brood . This is the summer for Fronnie . Here am I  --  a tree with leaves turnin and ii()win off when the wind blows  --  I am in the autumn of life . Y es , the autumn of life . I 'm startin down the hill  --  goin to the winter of life . " There is Battle over there just passed to the big Beyond , beyond this winter of life . We are like a flower growin by the waters , Half-Pint . We are like a flower growin by the waters , Ugly Bird  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we come forth from the roots of old stumps . And we grow and put forth leaves and we blossom . And we bring forth fruit , good fruit and bad fruit in our season just as the Word ' says , Fronnie  --  in the autumn our fruit is garnered and our leaves shrivel  --  our lives are beautiful sometimes in our old brown leaves , but not very often , Ellis . We just go down to decay . " Then what ? Do n't you know ? Winter . Decay . Death . "  | " You are right , Ell Dollarhide . You are right . " " Yes , Half-Pint . I think he 's right too . " " Yes , Fronnie . Life is a funny thing . But we are all here for a purpose . We all have a mission . And when that mission is done the Lord takes us home . The Lord will love and care for us all . He has the hairs on our heads numbered . " " Strike up a tune there on your guitar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellis , and set nigh him so you both can get together . Let 's sing , I am comin , Lord . ' Battle loved that song . " " All right . Let 's read a line and sing a line . " " All right . " The stars shine over the clapboard roof . The stars shine down on a lonely log house , big enough though to be unafraid if houses are afraid at night . The light of the stars is pretty , shining down on the clapboards  --  down on the green yard grass wet with drops of dew already . The stars listen , but the wind wo n't listen . The cool night wind keeps whispering to the soapy leaves on the poplar trees . Inside the house there is music . Hush ! Listen ! Music comes out where a windowpane is out . Music comes out and wind goes in . Maybe the wind chases the music out . Sunlight went in at this hole in the window this afternoon . Sunlight went in at this window and it shone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glint of amberish red . Wind went in at this hole and played with the corner of the sheet where Battle was dead and lay covered with a sheet  --  with a sheet under him . But hear the wail coming on the wind ! Tho ' coming weak and vileThou dost my strength assure ; Thou dost my vileness fully cleanse So spotless all and pure . ' T is Jesus call me on , To perfect faith and love , To perfect hope , and peace , and trust For earth and Heaven above.  |p177And  He assurance givesTo loyal hearts and true , That every promise is fulfilled To those who bear and do . More words through the hole in the window float out to the wind at night . Words follow the wind out at the hole and float on the night wind under the bright stars . Under the night sky with white clouds floating in the sky . Under the soapy poplar leaves and the words rub their soft sides on the soapy sides of the leaves and against the tender green ribs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wail of guitar music on the night wind ? Wonder if Battle hears ? Wonder if Battle is the wind and in the wind he rubs against the slick bellies of the poplar leaves and kicks his toes against the green ribs of the leaves  --  Wonder if he is wind in a pair ofcan long drawers and a blue shirt  --  a work shirt washed clean and without the smell of wood smoke and sweat . The wail of ' words and music again : There is a land of wondrous beauty Where the " Living Waters " flow , The word of God to all has said it And it surely must be so . No tears are there , no blighting sorrow From the cruel hand of Death ; No flowers fade , no summers perish By the winter 's chilling breath . I 've loved ones there who passed before me , They 'll rejoice to see me come , But best of all , I 'll see my Saviour , Who will bid me welcome home . And now the words of songs do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words of song are silent . And Holy-J tie Madden is there and he prays words to the winds . Thep178words are loud and they are jumbled words  --  filled with Thee 's and Thou 's and Thy 's . They come out the window and slip along the belly of the wind . The pretty night wind  --  the words of Holy-Joe Madden ride out like the words of the songs  --  out among the poplar leaves and over at the pig pen through the leaves on the sweet-gum trees . Hear them ! Words ! And then : " Poor Pap . Dead . Dead . Dead as a beef . Over there  --  See ! " " Fronnie , no ust to take on like that ! We all got to die . " " Yes , but Sweetbird . You do n't understand . He is my father . He is dear to me . I know more than you do what he has went through with for us and it makes him nearer to me . " " Yes , Fronnie Bradberry , you 'll worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be buried like he was just layin down to take a nap of sleep --  " " How was that , Fronnie ? " " Half-Pint , he told me he wanted to be buried with his blue work shirt on , open at the collar without a necktie  --  wanted to be buried in his long white heavy winter drawers . See , Pap never would wear a necktie  --  not even on the day he got married . And he did n't want to be buried in one . He wanted Ugly Bird Skeans to dig his grave and you , Half-Pint McAlister , to make his coffin --  " " He did --  " " Yes . " " And you said , Fronnie , he wanted me to dig his grave , did n't you ? " " Yes , Ugly Bird , that was Pap 's dyin request . " " I 'll shore dig it then . " " I 'll shore make that coffin too . I do n't want no dead man back here hantin me . " " You know people request some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wellkid before he died ast that they bury him in a hollow black-gum log  --  just poke him down in it feet-first and nail some boards over the end of the log and bury him standin up back yander at the roots of a big pine tree  --  the biggest back yander on the Wellkid hill . " " Did they bury him that way , Ell ? " " No . They was ashamed to bury him like that . Ashamedp179that their neighbors would talk . But since they buried him they 've been sorry ever since . They talk about diggin him up and buryin him that way yet . They wish all time they had put Bennie away the way he requested . " " Why ? " " W'y he 's hanted them . They think he has . A man has been seen run across the road several times nigh the place where they buried Bennie . He 's been seen there by Wellkid 's kinfolks . He runs across the road and sometimes keeps ahead of them for a little while and then he just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Wellkid has packed a pistol ever since he seed it there one night . Said he 'd fill it full of holes  --  a ghost back here where it do n't belong hantin people who had nothin to do with buryin its body . " " Let 's sing another song and some of us can stay and some of us can go and come tomorrow night  --  You aim to have the buryin day atter tomorrow at ten o'clock , do n't you , Fron-nie --  " " Yes if we can keep him that long . " " Drew , can you play Where will you spend Eternity ' ? " " Yes . " " Strike up the tune then . " The knife blade nimbly shifts on the strings . And there is a wail of music and of words . They float as the other words out onto the night wind  --  to the poplar leaves and to the cow pastureand maybe to the ears of Battle , the wind ears of Battle  --  and maybe Battle hears and Battle laughs like the violin of wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The question comes to you and me ! Tell me , what shall your answer be ? Where will you spend eternity ? Leaving the straight and narrow way , Going the downward road today , Sad will their final ending be ,  --  Lost through a long eternity !  |p180RefrainETERNITY  ! ETERNITY ! Lost through a long eternity ! Repent , believe this very hour , Trust in the Saviour 's grace and power , Then will your joyous answer beSAVED THROUGH A LONG ETERNITY ! The wind leaking in at the window holes and between the undaubed cracks and through the newspapered walls can not sizzle like the last breath of wind that Battle breathed . No . Damned if the wind can . Damned if the wind can whisper through the green leaves on the hickory beside the corn crib like the wailing of the cornfield voices so used to " Old Black Joe " and " Nellie Was a Lady . " No . No . There is the wind however and there were the voices just a few wooden minutes ago . There is the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  floating like a red oak chip on a clear pond of water . This moon is shining down on the clapboards  --  moss-covered , shining down on life , down on Death  --  death between the two white sheets . There is the color of burned clay between the sheets , a pile of clay burned out like a candle in the past eighty-four years of living . But it will burn no more  --  not even for the saw swish-swish music of the cool silver wind in the green hickory leaves and among the slick-bellied green poplar leaves . But the clay is quiet , not as the sheets are white , but it is quite white , and it is silent as the sheets are silent  --  quiet as the sheets , all but the corner of one where the wind blows through where a windowpane used to be and shakes the corner of the sheet with unseen hands . Hear the cornfield voices . Hear them ! Some are soft like the spirit of wind  --  maybe the spirit of Battle Keaton that is a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the wind through the place where the windowpane used to be and rubbed its belly on the icicle-colored jaggers of sun-dried putty  --  maybe , maybe so . Maybe his spirit is a pretty piece of wind out now under this red-oak chip moon so red-waspfloating-likein the pond-colored sky  --  maybe , maybe so . Hearp181the voices as the figures go down the toe-path under the pretty moon  --  hear them ? Maybe the spirit of Battle Keaton hears as it slides among the soapy poplar leaves , fresh in the moonlight and the wind and jewel cover with sparkling beads of dew  --  may be the spirit of Battle Keaton as it goes wind-like through wind and counts the rows of plowed corn and talks to the corn whispering in the night wind and goes back to the hill where Daid is buried , where Pansy is buried in Flint County  --  goes back to the old cornfields at night where bushes have grown above the prints of corn rows left . And maybe the thumb and the index finger have crushed the guts out of the striped-back she-spider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except no one exactly knows about it . Now the dog howls by the window where the wind goes through the place where the windowpane used to be , where the words and the music came through and the sunlight and wind went in . The voices get faint and fainter . The moon is getting red and the moon is sailing potato ridges of clouds like a red apple floating in a blue stream of mountain water . The dog barks and the people talk . Figures are walking the toepath , figures of living clay the hills have made tough , for they belong to the hills  --  tough like the roots of the oak that sinks into the hard Kentucky clay . And now the voices die  --  voices of figures in the dark wormingalong the toe-path through the field of green corn . The dog does not bark at the window . The wind is all that 's singingnow  --  the wind in the green corn , in the poplar leaves and around the hole in the window . And let the wind sing tonight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tomorrow many may give heed to the wind and the sky , for this is a season for growing . Leaf Shelton , Purvy Winston , Rosa Winston , Jack Tarr , Amos Tarr , Lena Feathers , Ina Sneed , Leona Warm , Roy Chitwoodsit up with the corpse tonight  --  sit up in the back room beside the dead silent clay . The rest have gone home . They were tired out , worked hard in the cornfield today . Part of them will not work tomorrow . They 'll drop out of crops long enough to pay the last respect to the burned-out clay of Battlep182Keaton 's  --  Battle has been one of them so long and they have known Battle so well , that when he died a tree fell  --  a tall tree fell in their little forest . " Sweetbird , I brought my handsaw and hammer over this mornin . I brought all my tools . I 'm ready to begin that coffin  --  where is the lumber ? Down at the barn ? " " Yes , Half-Pint . It is down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight seasoned oak planks down there and they ai n't got no knot holes in them neither . You 'll find the wild-cherry planks up over the cow shed on the rafters . Chickens been roostin on them , but the manure is dried now  --  just brush it off and go ahead . It wo n't matter much . " " Have you got any of them square-bellied tens and eightpennynails , Sweetbird ? " " Yes . You 'll find them in the tool box . The tool box is in the corn crib locked up . Here is the key . That damn boy of mine , Snider , steals out all my wrenches and loses them . I had to lock the tools up . " " All right . " " Half-Pint , I 'll have to go over and see Ugly Bird about digginthe grave  --  I guess he 's about ready to start work now . " " Where do you aim to bury him , Sweetbird  --  with his first wife or his second wife or his third wife ? " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that is just what Fronnie means to have done . People will talk , I told her , but she do n't care . You know how a woman is to have her way  --  people will talk about Battle bein laid over there on the Runyan Hill by his second wife  --  there is where Fronnie is goin to have him buried . " And Fronnie says : " I aim to have Pap buried on the Runyan Hill . That was his last request before he died . And that 's what I aim to have done . He wants to be buried by Daid . I know people will talk about me having Pap buried by his second wife , but let them talk . What do I care what people says . This is the last thing I can do for Pap and I aim to do it . "  | Half-Pint says : " Heaven has always been a funny thing to me and this makin the right connections from this world in I leaven . Now I wonder how Battle Keaton will act when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wonder which one he 'll run around with in Heaven and which one of the five husbands his third wife will choose . I wonder about such stuff as this and if they 'll be any marriages in Heaven , and if men and wimmen has all the lust took out'n ' em . " Winky Blair comes up and he says : " Nice coffin you 're makin , Half-Pint , if you 'll get some that chicken manure off'n the lid  --  Smells this hot July weather  --  nice coffin you 're makin though . " Fidas Keen comes down the path and he says : " Sweetbird , I come over to shave Battle and wash his body and lay him out in the coffin  --  to cut his hair if it needs to be cut and put the clothes on him you want put on him . " Sweetbird says : " All right , Fidas . The razor , the one Dad give me after he quit shavin and he told me his Pap used the same razor  --  the razor and the shavin brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little shelf above the water bucket in the kitchen  --  hot water a-plenty in the teakettle . Go right out there and shave Dad and get him ready for the coffin . We 'll soon have the coffin made  --  coffin ready to put Dad in . " Ugly Bird Skeans tells his wife Georgia : " I 'll have to leave the crop long enough if the weeds does take the crop to dig that grave for Battle Keaton . I 'll have to take my grave tools , my broadax , my coal pick , my mattock and my poleax and double-bitted ax . I have to help pay the last respect to a dead man . It is the last time I have a chance to help Battle . So just mark me out'n the cornfield today . You ought to go over to Sweetbird Bradberry 's and stay with Fronnie . She 's nigh grieved to death . No use stayin here and workin today . Take a day off when a body 's dead . Corn wo n't spile . If it spiles , let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buryin be ? " " Tomorrow at ten o'clock Fidas told me last night comin back . " " Reckon he 'll keep that long and the weather so hot ? "  | " Yes , hell yes . He 'll keep that long if they 'll fix that hole in the winder there by his bed so the flies ca n't come in at that hole . Yes , hell yes , he 'll keep that long . It ai n't hard to keep a body in July under two days , but over two days it is hard to keep a body in hot weather . That will just be the rest of this day , tonight and a piece of tomorrow . Then Holy-Joe Madden will preach the funeral . " " Are you goin now , Ugly Bird ? " " Yes . I am goin now , Georgia . I am goin to the Runyan Hill Graveyard and dig a grave for Battle . " Morning . The sun up pretty and getting fairly high in the sky . White clouds move out across the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows , follow the crows flying over the July earth . And at the big log house birds carry worms to the young birds in nests in the eave vines . Spiders are catching flies in webs on the low-loft Battle helped to build . Down at the barn . Hear the pigs grunting for their slop . It is late this morning . The feeding has not been done . It is late and pig grunts are loud as the hammer 's head hitting the planks in Battle 's coffin  --  and the moo-oo 's of the cows are loud as the oo-zoo 's of the handsaw running through the wild- ! cherry planks to build a coffin lid for Battle 's coffin . But men are working . Five men are working at the barn now . If you could only see them . There goes one with a wild-cherry plank . There goes one with a hammer and a handful of square-bellied nails . There is another with a handsaw . They are making a coffin . And here is the Runyan Hill Graveyard  --  a hilltop overlookinga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patch of potato ridges where seeds are buried that will never sprout . They are called the clay-temple seeds . And here are men this morning  --  working in the sunlight amid the old trumpet vines , honeysuckle and sand briars  --  near the mass of green pines where wind keeps talking like it talks to the corn . Here is Ugly Bird already . He is showing the men what to do . He is showingthem how to dig the grave . Down in the earth now one is working , working  --  throwing out long-handle shovels of dirt  --    over his shoulder on the bare ground and on the saw briars . There a shovel full is coming up , see it ! It is fresh moist-lookingclay . There is a big yellow heap of clay thrown up now and when a shovel is emptied on the egg-end top , sprangles of yellow clay roll off into the sand briars and down among the honey-suckle vines . And here is where the pale burned-out temple of Battle 's clay will mix with fresher clay  --  fresh yellowclay will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Battle Keaton . The coffin is done now . Pert and Ellis and Half-Pint carry it toward the back room . They carry it from the cow shed . Pert and Ellis run a stick under the front end of it and carry on each side of the coffin and Half-Pint tails the back end of the coffin and follows toward the back room . It is a heavy box because oak wood is heavy wood and wild-cherry wood is a heavy wood . It is made of oak and wild-cherry  --  made with square-bellied nails and plenty of them too . They have gone under the yard pine trees now where the path leads on the northeast side of the house  --  down across the burdock by the side of the house and a-past the hollyhocks then . " Heavy damn thing , ai n't it , Pert ? " " Yes , it 's a heavy damn thing , Half-Pint . " Into the door they go  --  into the hole in the house . Fronnie opens the door and holds it open . The door has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back room . Fronnie lets the door fly closed . She hurriedly places two chairs down with backs toward the window  --  two rest pieces for the ends of the coffin to rest on . Pert has lifted hard at carrying the coffin into the house . His face is red as a Roman Beauty apple . Ellis is wiping sweat with the corner of his colored shirt he pulls from under the draw string under his pants . The tail of his blue shirt is wet and he sticks it back under his pants  --  rolls and lights a cigarette  --  cigarette rolled in brown-sugar sack paper . Now they stand  --  Half-Pint looks at Battle  --  Battle now getting white and whiter like the color of the tip-end of his beard when the sun is not shining on the tip-end of his beard . " Ai n't no hot water in that teakettle , " Fidas Keen comes in and says  --  " Ai n't no water a-tall in that teakettle . It 's dry as aP 186chip  --  been dry a long time . Fronnie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Battle 's face so I can scrape off them beard . I want to get Battle dressed . It is nigh two o'clock and people will be comfin in here tonight to set up with the corpse . " " I 'll heat you some water , Fidas  --  just a minute . " Silence is in the room now . Silence , and a smattering of wind that comes in the room from the hollyhocks and the greenhickoryleaves . Silence is in the room and Battle is in the room  --  Battle white and dead , dead as a beef . His white beard tips are toying with the smattering of wind that comes through the place where the windowpane used to be and where the windowpaneought to be now to keep out the wind and the flies . If Battle could only see the sunlight close to him ; if he could only see the room and Half-Pint , Ellis , and Pert standing silently in the room . Yes , if Battle could only see  --  see the coffin resting on the chairs made of the rough lumber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muslin sheet spread over the quilts  --  a feather pillow for Battle 's head  --  a pillow made of goose down and goose feathers  --  ah , if Battle could only see . There is the green grass in the yard . There is the silver wind in the poplar leaves and there is a green field of pretty waving corn . Battle is blind to it all . If Battle could only see as he did when he watched the Spider on the low-loft trap the flies for grub . And there is the razor now , the mug , the lather and the shaving brush . And there is the wash tub with plenty of hot water in the back room now . Fidas is in the back room  --  no women , not even Fronnie , are in the back room now . If Battle could only feel the big razor going through his long beard and cutting it with little scrape-scrapes like mowing machine blades cut cane stalks pencil-sized . If Battle could only see again , could only know again , could only see again --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawers  --  they are spotless , for I washed them last night and dried them by the kitchen fire . They are clean and white  --  spotless white just like Pap wanted them . There is the blue shirt  --  faded some though it is . But they are clean and do n't smell sweaty and do n't smell of brush smoke . Take them when you need them . Here they are by the door . Just come here and get them . "  | " All right , Fronnie . Keep that door closed , for we are about ready to wash his body now and get him ready for the coffin and get him in the coffin . " " Is that all the clothes you aim to have put on your father  --  just a pair of drawers and a shirt ? What is the matter , Fronnie , with that black suit I saw Battle wearin over on Hog Branch to the Protracted Meetin ? " " I aim to have Pap buried just like that , for that is the way Pap wanted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be buried . " " Just with a pair drawers on and a shirt ! " " Yes . " " Why ? " " It was Pap 's dyin request . That 's why ! He said he was a-layin down just like he was goin to sleep and get out'n the bed on Judgment Day at the sound of the trumpet . " " Ai n't you goin to put a necktie on him neither ? " " No . " " Why ? " " Because he never wore one of them strings around his neck in his life . I aim to see he is buried in his shirt and drawers just as he requested . " " Then the coffin will have to be worked over . We have made a long straight lid and when we lift the lid to let people look at Battle they 'll see him a-layin there just in his shirt and drawers and they 'll think we forgot to dress him  --  And people never will get over talkin about it . You know how the Turners will talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Damn the Turners . I can lick every damn one of them . All dishonest as hell . All mule faces fur as Sweetbird Bradberry is concerned . I can lick ' em all . I do n't want a damn one of ' em snoopin round at the funeral either . If there is you 'll see anotherfuneral and see it pretty damn quick . I double-dare any one of them to say anythin about old Dad there and let me get the straight of it . I 'll show you a cockeyed Turner less . " " Half-Pint , we can just saw that lid into down about where Battle 's heart is and nail the lower part down and raise the restP188of the lid  --  that 'll only show Battle 's face and his hands crossed over his heart . " " Let 's carry it out , boys , and get this done . " " All right . " And here comes Lula Riggs . Lula Riggs comes with an arm load of flowers and she says : " Miss Bradberry , here 's some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here is some ironweed blossoms , some honeysuckle , violets , corn flowers and buttercups . "  --  And Fronnie says : " Thank you , Lula . Thank you a big lot for all these pretty flowers . " Fronnie takes the flowers and puts them in the back room . She places them inside the door . Fidas meets her there and takes the flowers  --  Fidas inside the back room getting Battle ready for burial . And here comes Violet Egbert . She comes across the cow pasture with a load of flowers . One can see her from the window  --  hereshe comes  --  " Miss Bradberry , here is some flowers Mama sent over for the corpse . Here is some wild snowballs , some susans , some white clover blossoms , some buttercups , pinks , white daisies and some sunflowers . " And Fronnie says : " Thank you , Violet . Thank you a big lot for the pretty flowers . " And Fronnie carries them to the door and hands them to Fidas . Fidas carries the flowers on back through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Fronnie , here is some flowers I brought over to go with the corpse . Here is some sheep-shower blooms and some goldenrod partly green and some Scottish thistle and pea-vine blossoms and some sunflowersand mornin glories . " " Thank you , Jack , for the flowers . Thank you a big lot , Jack , for all the pretty flowers . " And here comes Pert , Ellis and Half-Pint with the coffin now . They come under the yard pines and through the front door and through the partition door with the spring to it . They go in the back room with the coffin and put it on the same two chairs . And Ellis says : " Got it right this time . It 's a good piece of work . It will hold any dead man and hold himP189for a long time  --  hold him against time , dirt and worms . That is a good coffin  --  good as I ever seed a coffin made . But Battle needs a good coffin if ever a man needs a good coffin . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a-gettin the coffin finished , I shaved Battle 's beard off and washed his body all by myself . Look at that water there in that tub , wo n't you . That will show you what I been doin . Been cleanin a dirty dead man by-hell  --  a man plum dirty . Look at that water , wo n't you ! But he is a clean man for burial now . He 's good and clean too  --  ready to be in that coffin . And if he was a dad o ' mine I would put a pair pants and a necktie on him . Ca n't tell where the spirit of a man goes when he is dead and it must go in the same dress that the body went to the grave in , surely it must . Them old long winter drawers and that old blue work shirt without a necktie  --  hell'sfire ! " " But when a man requests a thing done , I say do it as he wants it done and not as you want to do it . That body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what must be done with it instead of you sayin . That body was alive just a short time ago . It breathed wind into the lungs in it and et grub . It was a livin body . But now it is a dead body  --  dead as a beef . I 'm just like Fronnie . If it was my father I 'd put him away as she wants him put away  --  the way he requested . " Half-Pint and Fidas catch the wash tub under the ears and carry the water to the back porch to pour it over the bank . There they go with the water and Fidas says , " Ai n't that water awful black ? " And Half-Pint says : " Yes , that water is damn black . That water is damn black . " And when they pour it off the porch there are long wisps of dirty whiskers settled in the bottom of the washing tub  --  whiskers , long and silky  --  like twisted dirty silk ropes  --  And that is the beard that Battle wore  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry the empty wash tub out to hang it on a nail in the smoke-house wall . Fidas says : " Funny thing about that corpse I never had to happen when I was shavin any dead man I ever shaved . HeP190had been dead ever since yesterday and when I cut a little place on his neck with the razor when I was goin down on his neck after some long scattered neckhairs and you ought to have watched the red blood spill out of that place  --  come out'n there like he was a live man . You would n't a thought that , would you , white as Battle Keaton is ? " " No . " " Well , I 've shaved many a corpse and I never had that to happen before . " Now Battle Keaton is in his coffin . Ellis and Pert put him in . Fronnie came in and bossed . Fronnie is in the room now . She is crying . Her eyes are swollen and puffed like red-pepper pods left in the rain . She saw that Battle was placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was firmly tucked away before the lid was nailed down on him . And the light of another day is gone . The light has gone somewhere  --  has fallen on the green hills in northeast Kentucky . The sun has gone down beyond the green mountains of leaves on Peavine Ridge . There are red banks of clouds where the sun used to be . But the day has gone and the night comes on  --  night with her stars and her golden moon  --  moon the color of a red-oak chip . And here is Battle . And here is Battle . See him ! Look at Battle in his coffin and the scent of wild flowers fills the room  --  wild flowers cover the homemade coffin . There is Battle silent and pretty in his coffin . He is clean and white and there is the scent of wild flowers in the room . The lid of the coffin down to his heart is thrown back so people can go and look at Battle 's face if they want to see his face  --  It is night now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corpse . His death has spread out among the hills and people have come from far and near to see Battle in his last appearance  --  the last before he rests in the bosom of his native Kentucky shoemake clay . And some tonight have brought arm loads of wild flowers and yard flowers  --  There is an armload of wild roses and there are many wild yuccas , buttercups , touch-me-nots and four-o'clocks . Flowers crown the head of the casket . Flowers are everywhereover the room . There is the sweet scent of wild flowers .   There is the pretty glow of wild flowers under the yellow light of the lamps  --  under the golden glow of the moonlight that hits the windowpanes and streaks across the back-room floor . The people are coming in now . See them as they come up the toe-path through the cornfield and walk under the cherry trees by the garden . See them as the moonlight falls on the moth-eaten black shawls and the overalls  --  See them . They come up the toe-path  --  up from the cornfield . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last time unless it is tomorrowwhen they open him for the last sight of his face as he resigns himself to the earth forever . " Come on in , you folks . Make yourselves at home . " Come on in , folks  --  just set any place you can find a seat . " Anybody is welcome in my house but a person that has the last name of Turner . No Turner is welcome in my house . If a Turner is here now I want that Turner to get out before I put him out . I mean business , too . If a Turner goes to Heaven I do n't want to go there . If one goes to Hell I know I do n't want to go there . I hate a Turner and Dad did n't allow none here when he was livin and by-hell Sweetbird Bradberry ai n't goin to allow none here this night when poor old Dad Keaton lays a corpse . No . Dad is too near and too dear to me . Dad got on the Lord 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Turners . " And now the wail of the guitar and the wail of the words and the power of words float out upon the night wind . Could my tears forever flow , Could my zeal no languor know , These for sin could not atone Thou must save and Thou alone ; In my hand no price I bring , Simply to Thy cross I cling . While I draw this fleeting breath , When mine eyelids close in death , When I rise to worlds unknown , And behold Thee on Thy throne , Rock of ages cleft for me , Let me hide myself in Thee . P192Hear the words on the night wind . Hear them ! Hear the dog howl by the window ! Hear the wail of the guitar ! Smell the scent of fresh wild flowers . See the people in the back room  --  see them ! See Battle white as chalk in his coffin ! See it all  --  this is the night of stars and wind and death  --  this is the night . Hear the winds whisper  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of silence , stars and leaves and death . Out on the wind there are words floating among the leaves  --  floating on the wind . There are stars in the sky . There is wind in the corn . There is a red oak chip-colored moon riding in a pretty color-of-pond sky . See it all  --  see Battle too . He is in his coffin  --  even if Battle could only see this night ! P193I THOUGHT somethin funny the way Finn took the gun and stayed off rabbit huntin every day in the week rain or shine . Sometimes he brought back one little puny rabbit . Sometimes-he did n't bring back airy one . He allus went the same way over that yaller bank below the house and down by the hog lot . I can see him yet a-goin over the bank with a double-barrel gun throwed over his shoulder  --  a-shinin in the sun  --  both barrels just shinin blue as a pair of blacksnakeson a sand-bank in the spring . He would allus say to me , " Ma , I 'll bring back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy Finn . In the last year he 's growed up like a hickory sprout . He ca n't wear his Pa 's shoes any more . We had to cut the doors out a little for him . He 's got so tall . And when he bumped his fard on the door facin he just cussed a blue streak . I could n't stand it no longer hear'n him cuss so weaked around before the little youngins . I had Mick to cut the doors out for him . He 's got so tall that he had to sleep slonch-ways on the bed . He got to cussin about his feet stickin over the end of the bed and gettin from under the kiver . I jist sold cream , chickens , butter and eggs and bought that boy a bed long enough to keep his feet warm and I made the quilts long enough to go down over his feet so he could sleep in comfort . He quit cussin then around the house . He never was much of a hand with the girls to my knowins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes with a off-look in them . His face was freckled as a guinea . He ' peared to be bashful around wimmen . He just stayed in the woods with a gun after the croppin was done . His Pa grumbled about buyin him shells  --  said he 'd break a man up buyin him shells . And I said , " Well you 'd better buy him shells to shoot a few rabbitsand birds with than to have him doin like a lot of boys around here  --  a-gettin the good girls in trouble , tellin them they 'd do this and do that  --  marry them and a lot of stuff . " I says , " You look at Frank Kimsey 's girl had to marry thatP194snotty-nosed thing of Alec Tremble 's that gadded all about over the country and sold licker . Look at that girl of Fidas Blevins ' that had that sixteen-pound baby  --  a little bit of a stringy-headed thing not out of school yet . Did n't weigh a hundred pounds . Like to never got him to marry her . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babies and he never did treat her right . " Mick just set there . He never said a word . And I says to Mick : " He never looks at a girl around the place . He 's good to help me . I call him in out of the fields to help me cook a meal 's vittals and he 'll come right in and put on a apron and help me . I can call him in when somethin gets wrong with my sewin machine and he 'll come right in and fix it . " And Mick says : " You ai n't give him time to do his kavortin yet . He 's too young . Your brothers war n't no angels . I ai n't been no angel , but the part of my life before I married you belongs to me . It was the best . You can have the rest . That boy will come out'n it like a bull one of these days . You know the time the Law come over here lookin for him when he 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seymore girl they sent to the perform school for goin to the woods . You rememberhe run out there , the little shaver did , and climbed right in the top of that oak tree to get away from the Law  --  scared like a rabbit and shakin all over . " A good woman do n't want to remember stuff like that . They want to forget it about their men and their boys . I just never thought of it . Mick remembered it . In the spring Finn would take the gun when the trees was a-puttin out and go over the hill and say he 's goin to get a ground hog . Trees were kindly leafed out . No time to hunt . I 'd tell him the old ground hogs had youngins . In the summertime it was squirrels . In the fall it was birds and rabbits . In the winter it was polecats and foxes . It was Reece Fiddler 's girl that come around Finn all the time . I could tell . She went to callin me Mother . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this and Mother to me for that . Then she come to me one day and wanted my littleP195Effie to go down on the creek by that big hole of water and go in a-swimmin with her where everybody could see them a-showin their legs and I just would n't stand for it . When my mother was a-washin clothes behind the smoke house and a stranger come behind the smoke house and spoke to her she made it her business to roll her sleeves down right there and not show her arms above her elbows . Symanthia Fiddler wanted to work for me . She wanted to make her home with me . She was a pretty girl if she 'd a had any clothes to her back and a girl good to work as I ever saw . She wanted to leave that shanty in the timber woods they lived in and I do n't blame her for that . It was put up with slabs from the mill and roofed with third ply rubber-roy roofin . Rain just poured in and they slept on the dirt floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and there where he could get the ginnin to do for fifty or seventy-five cents a day . Symanthia helped him sprout pastures off for twenty-five cents a day . She could use a scythe like a man and then go to a dance and dance all night . I told her to come on over . We was in the crop then and it took all hands and the cook too  --  strawberries to pick and corn to plow and terbacker to hoe . It just kept us goin from daylightto dark . Symanthia said she 'd made enough money to buy her a few dresses sweepin out the timber cutters ' shanties . That was when they 's a-cuttin out the Harkreader tract . The mill had to make eleven sets to get that big tract of timber . Symanthia brought six right pretty dresses in a pace-board suit case . She came to stay with us . A prettier girl , I believed , I never saw . Her eyes was pretty as a sleepy-eyed doll  --  one of them old kind us youngins used to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown sealin wax you put around fruit jars and she was big and neat as a limb and strong as a ox . She just put on overalls and worked like a man right about the place and just whistled and sung all the time . Her cheeks red as the comb of a layin hen . I wonder how she bought all them dresses pretty as they was , silks and satins of about all kinds and colors . I give her the room off to herself up on the edge of the kitchen . We cutP196that room off from the kitchen when Aunt Minnie come to stay with us so she 'd have a room by herself when she took one of them drowsy spells . I give this room to Symanthia and told her to make herself at home and she said she would for me not to worry about her . I 'd pon my soul to God I never saw a thing crooked out of that girl . She made herself at home with us and better help you never saw in your life . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to go home and she said she would n't go back to that shanty . I felt sorry for poor old Tillie Fiddler comin after her own born blood and she would n't pay no attention to her . She said right there to her own mother , " You know , Mom , I 'd go some place if I could change my name from Fiddler . I hate the name . I do n't look like the Fiddlers . I ai n't got their red hair and their simelon heads . I ai n't got their old snaggled teeth and their little pipestem legs . I do n't believe I 'm a Fiddler . " Poor old Tillie just stood there . She was so took over the way Symanthia was actin and the tears just streamed down her cheeks . She just has a few old snags in her mouth sharp as a cat 's eye-teeth and they kindly stuck out in front and her little bony legs did look like pipestems . I felt so sorry for her . If Symanthia had been a girl of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fit all over one of these hills . I 'd a whopped her or I 'd a killed her right there . Raise a devilish youngin and let one stand up and talk to you like that after you go through the pain of birth for them . That 's too much ! Well , I said to Tillie : " I do n't want you to think I 'm harborinSymanthia here . She wanted to just come and make her home here and she begged me too . I let her come . If she did n't come she 'd go someplace else and the Lord knows where a good girl can get these days . If they go to town , they ai n't good long . You know that . Them factories spiled many a good girl right out'n these hills . Used to be when a good girl went away in respectable duds on her back she come back with her jaws all smeared with red paint and one of them hobble skirts on till she could n't move her legs when she walked . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good Baptis home . " Tillie Fiddler just turned and walked off and cried like her heart would break : " And my own girl has turned me down after me raisin her the best way I could  --  with a lazy no-count fox-huntin and fiddlin man to keep and a pack of lazy triflin boys that I have to whop like mules for not workin in the fields after I bend over somebody 's washtub five days out'n the week . It will all come home to you , my little lady . " I noticed Finn never took the gun anymore and went a-huntin . He stayed at home and worked better than he ever worked . I noticed at breakfast time Symanthia would give Finn the best plate , a blue plate that 's got a hunter in the bottom of it with his gun up and cocked at some birds flyin over a oat patch . She would give him one of my big thick teacups to drink his coffee from and a big white saucer that did n't have a chip in it any place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his tears and come home spreein till I pasted his head over once with a milk crock . That kept him from breakin up all my dishes . She always give him the newest spoon and the fork with the straightest prongs and the straightest knife . Symanthia stayed with us all summer . Mick never said much . He just watched once ' n a while like a man will do . She was good to help me with the milkin and the work around the house . She canned the strawberries and helped to cut weeds from the corn . She was full of life like a boy and she got a good color in her face and was pretty as a doll . One day I told her stayin with us and workin and eatin regular meals agreed with her and she said that it did . She was so good to help and we had so much work to do that Mick said he 'd fix up the house a little bit over on the fur place and move Symanthia 's Pa and Ma and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards and chinked and daubed the open cracks and fixed the doors and winders and moved them in with just one wagon load of house plunder for our little rabbit mules . Now you know how much they had.  |p198They  was just about on starvation . We let them have taters we 's a-feedin to our cows . We went their note at the store and helped them get grub . Symanthia went back home to live with her people after they moved into the house on our fur place . Finn worked the cornfields near Fiddler 's . That piece of ground that runs down in the cove in front of their house  --  it always took Finn so long to plow it . I begin to think Finn might be in love with Symanthia Fiddler . She was so good to his stummick and that 's what a lot of men want . A woman that ' 11 keep their stummicks filled with better grub than any of the rest gets . I did n't want Finn to marry and get tied down with a woman and a house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make a big lawyer ' r a doctor out'n him or a school teacher so he could walk with a pencil behind his ear and not have to cut the same sprouts on the same hill every year . I even saw Symanthia come up through the bushes once when I was back in the orchard gettin green apples for breakfast . I saw her come out like a rabbit and meet Finn and they went out on the ridge together . Symanthia and Finn was both barefooted and he put his arms around her and she put her arms around him . W'y they both walked side by side in a path nar enough for a rabbit . I took notice right there . I never said a word . I thinks to myself . " I 'll just wait and catch on. , , Well , them Fiddlers just cleaned up our place . They sprouted off the hills and used our mules and plowed up big fields for corn . They 's the best workers a body might nigh ever seed . They set terbacker out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They knowed how to get the ground rid of roots and fixed up for a shovel plow the first year . They knowed how to take good keer of the ground . Never saw a hill a-washin off where a Fiddler farmed it . We furnished them seeds of all kinds and the mules and give them half . They had a old cow they tied to the end of the wagon and brought and she was nothing but skin and bones and give bad milk out'n one teat , that was the reason they got her for a song and sung it themselves . I could n't a drunk a drap of that cow 's milk if I 'd a been a-dyin from starvation . I give Fiddlers the skimmed milk after we took the cream and sold it . Took It away from the hogs , taters away from the cows , and keep them from starvin . God knows it was me that done it , for Mick wo n't stint a hog from milk . One day Finn come in to me and said : " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Symanthia . I used to go to the High School with him . He 's a nice boy  --  got somethin a-matter with his eyes . They 're a little crossed and girls do n't take to him , but he 'll make Symanthia a nice man to tie to . He 's a man , Ma , that buries the dead and he gets much as three hundred dollars for buryin one man . He is a undertaker . He wants to come here and see her , for he is somebody and it wo n't do to take him to her house . It wo n't do to let him see how Fiddlers live . W'y he ca n't stand that corn bread and skimmed milk and runty Irish taters . Would you keer for him to come over here this Saturday and stay till Monday mornin ? Symanthiamight want to marry him . It will be the thing for her to do . I got everythin fixed up between them . She can get her a man . " I was the best pleased woman in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said : " Yes , bring her right on . She can come to my house and see him if she wants to . The poor hard-workin girl . Let her get her a man that has a little money . " " Then I 'll tell Symanthia and she can write and tell Rodney Pennix to come on up and see her , " Finn said . His eyes just a-dancin around in his head . Symanthia come over to help me clean the house for this young fellar . We washed the house from top to bottom and put clean kivers on the beds , dressers and mantelpieces . We washed and scrubbed till I was vidaciously wore out . And Symanthia would say to me every once in a while : " Wait till I marry this rich undertaker and I 'll invite you to see me . I 'll have a fine house  --  big and painted white and a automobile . I 'll be somebody and you 'll be proud that you knowed me . " And I told her I used to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd got from livin was my youngins andP200my boys give me more worry ' n my girls . Never knowed the minute Finn was goin to get knifed or knife somebody . Get shot in the head . Get addled for life . Maybe get plugged about the heart . I told her it was bad anyway you looked at it . Bad to be a old man and shrivel up like a pawpaw . Bad to have a nest of little youngins and have to work like allget-outto feed ' em on these old hills . Then in the end never know what would become of your youngins if you die and leave ' em to the mercies of the people . It 's awful sweet to dream . When you dance you got to pay the fiddler . Rodney Pennix come a half day ahead of time . He got lost comin from town . He was four hours late . He was showed the big road and it looked like a body could n't miss it . It looked like a stray mule could a-followed that road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Rodney Pennix went nine miles out ' n the way . He turned down the fox-hunters ' pint and went down to Ulings . Then he got on another path . He circled into Eif Leadingham 's barn like a rabbit . He ast them where he was from Powderjay 's and they told him right up over the hill by a big rock and a sweet-apple tree . Dogged if he did n't get turned off that road and come around by Tin Hoggin 's house . He ast Ester Hoggins where Powderjayslived . She told him just stay in the road between the persimmontrees all the way around the hill . He could n't miss it . That 's the way that fellar got here . Effie was out in the yard and she come runnin in the house and said , " Ma , they 's the funniest-lookin man out ' n his eyes out here . " Well , I run out to see . I knowed it was that undertaker . He was dressed fit to kill with one of them high collars and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like gold fall-time blades fall from a broom-sage stool . His eyes just went around and around in the sockets like a addled rooster'shead when he 's spurred . He was dressed in good store clothes , but he was carryin a old guitar . I said , " Are you Mister Pennix that 's come here to see SymanthiaFiddler ? " And he said : " I 'm Mr. Pennix , the undertaker . I 've come to see Symanthia . I 've had a lot of trouble about gettin here . P201County roads are hard for me to follow , for I live in town . It 's been a long time since I 've had my feet on the dirt ' cept the graveyard dirt where we bury the dead . " " Symanthia 's in the back room in the house waitin for you . She 's a good-lookin girl , a good girl to my knowins and you can just lift the latch and walk in and make yourself acquainted . Finn is out plowin . He 'll be in soon , " I says to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when I come back I heard them in the back room laughin and talkin . Then I heard him pickin that old lonesome guitar and singin , " Those Brown Eyes . " Mick always said a fellar that would gallivant all over the neighborhood with a fiddle , guitar or a old friend 's harp with a drinkin-cup over it , was n't no good . Pap always said he did n't like the name of Pennix in the mountains . He said the name was n't no good and to mark his word on that , for he had n't lived ninety years for nothin . They had a roastin big fire in the back room in that fireplace , so big that the fireplace on our side would n't draw . Finn come in from turnin fall ground . He was wet to his knees and devilish nigh froze to death . When we called them to supper , Symanthia was the proudest girl I nearly ever saw . Her face was lit up bright as the lamp . She said to me in a whisper : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done ast me to marry him . Said he had plenty of money . He 's let me have his sweater with a big S on it for Simpsonville High School where he played ball and they give him the sweater . It 's the engagement token . " Well , that boy had to nearly get down in his plate to shovel up the beans with a fork . He looked right well all but his eyes . His pretty curly hair fell down over his stiff collar like a girl 's curly locks . He et like he was empty as a holler stump . Mick just passed him the grub and kindly grinned . He could n't see Mick grinnin at him . Symanthia et by the side of him . Finn et on ' tother side of the table . He would pass the beans and jam and say : " Rodney , have this . Rodney , have that . " Tillie happened to pass by from milkin her cow that was in our pasture . I was out hangin up my milk buckets . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look at your new son-in-law . "  |p202And  she come up and opened the door about big enough for a cat to get through . She said , " W'y is she going to marry that cross-eyed son-ofa-bitch ? I would n't have him for all his money and if all his head was strung in gold . What does Symanthia think about nohow ? I 'll get me a ax and split his goddamned brains out . I could come up behind him and he could n't see me . " " You ca n't do that , " I said to Tillie . " You had your chance to get your man . You took him . Let Symanthia have her chance . " " It 's hard to raise a girl up for a thing like that , " she said , " and I would druther have my man with two good eyes and a no-count fox hunter and fiddler than to have that thing . I 've done a lot better than she 's a-goin to do if she takes him . " Her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catlike teeth just popped when her jaws come together . I was afraid they would be trouble right there . She picked up her milk bucket . She kicked the cat clean off'n the porch . It was tryin to get in the milk . She went out under the sassafras . She went home fast as a pullet wantin to lay an egg . That night we heard a gruntin in the back room . Finn peeped through a knot hole in the door and crooked his fingerfor me to come . I do n't like to slip like a cat on people . I looked through the knot hole . There Symanthia was on his lap . She 's a heavy girl . He was a-gruntin and a-holdin her like she was a baby . He would kiss her and she would kiss him . They would whet their noses together like doves a-cooin . I said to Finn : " I 've seen a lot in my time , but this gets me . I ca n't stand to watch ' em no longer . " I quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those Brown Eyes I Love So Well , " till I was so sick of it . I nearly vomited at my stummick when I heard them words and that old guitar . They just et and run to the back room and fastened the doors . They acted like lovesickkittens . They burnt two cords of the dryest wood we had in two days . Symanthia did n't turn her hand to help me clean the dishes after they et . Rodney slept with Finn that night upstairs . He got Finn loved up and Finn liked to a neverp203broke loose from him . He called Finn his " little dove Symanthia " in his sleep and Finn just had to get out'n the bed and sleep on the floor on a quilt . He said his arms was so tight around him when he waked up that he had his wind cut off . Said he nearly had him choked down . Said he was weak as a cat . On Sunday , Rodney ast poor old Pap about old Uncle Jim Seymore . He had his name on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckon it would take him to kick the bucket so he would get him to bury . He ast about Aunt Subrinia Fields . ! low long it would be before she would die . Said he was promised her body to bury . He had a whole list of the old people 's names down to bury . Tellin my poor old Pap this and him ninety years old . You know Pap felt kindly funny . He felt like he might be after him . Then he talked about buryin people in coffins with brass knobs where people had the money and puttin ' em in steel coffins . And I just stood it long as I could stand it and I told him people in our neighborhoodmade their coffins for their dead and they 'd never heard tell of a undertaker before . I went out to milk on Monday mornin . When I come hack to the house Effie told me that Symanthia had left with that undertaker . I was plagued to death afraid Tillie would think I agged the whole works up . Finn said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simpsonville to stay with a married second cousin . She said to tell her Ma not to be uneasy about her . Finn told me they 'd been gone about twenty minutes when I come back to the house . Finn went to town to get the mules shod . Tillie come over to the milk gap . She ast me where Symanthia was . I told her she left with that undertaker , Rodney Pennix . I told her they had nearly time to get to town . And she said : " Oh , My God Almighty ! Has she run away with that thing ? " She lammed her milk bucket against the ground and took off toward the house barefooted . She had a old gingham dress on and a old slat bonnet . She went to town like that . Rodney paid Symanthia 's way across the Ohio River , Finn said . He said he got to town in time to see them get on theP204ferryboat . He heard Rodney tell Symanthia , " Honey , when you want the old coon cack , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready in his pocket to spend . " Then Finn said he went up town and was just took to death by Tillie standin on the corner by the drug store . She was barefooted . She had on that old gingham dress and slat bonnet . Finn said she said to him : " Finn Powderjay , was it you that got that thing up here to see Symanthia ? Finn told her it was n't him . If it was n't for havin to wash it out for fifty cents a day over the tub I 'd get me a lawyer to send that cross-eyed son-of-a-bitch to the penitentiary for ninety-nine years for white slavery . He paid my girl 's way over into another State and she ai n't but seventeen years old . If he ever comes back to this side of the river I 'll split his goddam brains out with a double-bitted ax . " Finn come on back home and was a-tellin me about it . It was just seven days till Symanthia come back home . She told Tillie she went to Rodney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He made the sweater for carryin water to the players on the team . She said his Pap had a little money , that he worked out on a section and a $i , 000 he got from his Grandma when she died . She said Rodney did n't have no money a-tall . Said all he got was what his Pap give him . Symanthia said that she had come back home to stay if her Ma would let her . She said she was a fool to leave her home with a stranger nearly blind . A undertaker all time talkin about buryin dead people . Finn picked up the gun and started huntin again . There was no more land to turn close to Fiddler 's house . It was all turned waitin for the winter freeze . He started rabbit huntin . He 'd be gone all day and come in without a rabbit . He 'd say the game was all killed out by the niggers from town . He could n't have no luck anymore . He hunted for the next two weeks day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day before he went to work on the State highway that he was tired of feedin a boy that would n't do nothin but rabbit hunt . He said he had to haul fodder in and stack it in the barn lot . Finn said he would . Mick says :   " My job is liable to play out after the next County election , then what am I to do ? Catch me in a trap . No corn in the ground  --  no fodder in for the cows . No job ! " 1 knowed they was somethin the matter with Finn . He went out to work . He harnessed the mules  --  hitched them to the sled . He went after fodder . He come in without a load of fodder . He said he was sick and had to go to the doctor quick , " I got to go to the Doctor , Ma , and do n't ast me nothin about it a-tall . I got to go . You unharness the mules and turn them in the woods pasture . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and says , " It ai n't your heart that ails you , is it , Finn ? " And he says : " Hell no it ai n't my heart . Do n't ast me no more questions . " I saw him top the pint goin fast as he could go out the ridge , past the pines and out of sight . He come in about three o'clock . Mick do n't get in till five . And I says , " What did the Doctor say was the matter with you , Finn ? " Finn was down wallerin in the grass . He got up and went to the barn . I could see him fall . I could see him wailer in the grass . The dead grass on the barn lot . I took out to the barn and I says , " Finn , you got to tell your Ma what is wrong with you . Have you got a bad disease ? " " That 's what I got , " said Finn , " I got a bad disease . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Finn . " Did you get it from Symanthia after she 's come back from Simpsonville ? " " Yes , " says Finn . " After that low-down hussy 's come over here and lived in my house and et my grub , " I says , " and then to think she 'd come back here with a disease and give it to my boy . " I was so mad I could a bit the iron poker in two . I just shook all over . I knowed what it was . Brother Jake had it twice . Brother Melvin had it seven times . My own boy a layin on the ground full of pain as a water barrel full of wiggle tails . Brother Jake was in Twolick , Kentucky , and a old strollop pecked on the winder above his head . She crooked her finger for him to come in . Jake was just a boy . She hooked him . He come nigh as a pea dyin . The doctor back inP206the mountains told him to eat apples for it . Drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one orchard . It did n't cure him . Old Lum Beaver 's yarb remedy was all that done him any good . It took four months . The second time he got it he used the yarb remedy . It did n't last him but two months . Brother Melvin had it a year and was cured by a Faith doctor on Apple Creek . Then he quit laughin about the sperit 's doins . Mick come in and he said : " What 's the matter that fodder ai n't in the barn lot ? Has Finn got the dropsy ? " And I says to Mick : " Do n't be too hard on the boy , Mick . He 's bad off . He sprained his back liftin over there this mornin . He was liftin a log in the way of the sled . " The next day I took the team and hauled the fodder and put it in the lot . I saw that little hussy of a Symanthia out gettin wood and I says : " Little hussy , do n't you put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . You got fifty-two rented over there of ours and you stay on that . Do n't you even come nigh me . You ai n't fit for a decent woman to touch . " She took me at my word and stayed away . She knowed I was mad enough to glom her eyes out with the pints of my fingers . I told Finn not to tell his Pap . He would go over to Fiddler 's with a knife . There would be trouble . He 'd run all Fiddlers off'n the place . Maybe knife somebody over it . He was so fractious over anything . I told Finn for God 's sa ' : e not to tell anybody . If it got out in the neighborhood he 'd be a outcast . People would run back to the woods when they saw him a-comin . People was afraid that if they touched him they 'd get what he got . When God knows the only way for a man to get it is from a old strollop . Just what Symanthia has got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finn kept his medicine in the tool box . He doctored hisself in the cowshed . He 'd come out of a mornin and waller on the dead grass and holler like he was a-dyin . I do n't know how it got out . It was whispered around that Finn Powderjay had " a bad disease . " When he got so he could go to Sunday school , people would n't set close to him . The girls would n't have a thing to do with him . I thought that it might be as hard for him to get a wife if he ever wanted to get married as it was for Brother Melvin . He liked to a-never got married . Girls was afraid of him . They thought once he had a bad disease he allus had it . He could n't get shed of it . I told Mick we ought to get Finn back in school in the middle of the year . I said he needed more education . We sold a couple of the cows and sent him to Wormwood University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our youngins was a little education . This was the time to make a doctor out of Finn . Tillie come to the barn to milk now . I never said a word to her about Finn and Symanthia . She told me that Symanthiahad never felt well since she had come from Simpsonville . I never said a word . I thought a whole lot . It come on the end of my tongue . I come nigh as a green pea spittin it out right there . But I did n't . It 's kindly toucheous to tell a mother about her daughter when your boy 's been into it and all messed up . I thought it best to keep my mouth shut . One day when Finn was gettin all right and felt better ' n he ever did he said to me , " Get your pipe and go over to Tillie Fiddler 's with me . " So I lit my pipe and we went over the little hill that is between our house . Finn give me some of his terbacker . We smoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad disease , he hated the looks of a woman . Said now he was gettin over it a little . He said he wanted to sec that Symanthia got a doctor . We went in the house and Tillie was took to death to see any of us over to her place . We had n't been there in so long . She was just fit to eat us up . She could n't be nice enough to  --  us . I give her some of my terbacker for her pipe . Me and her and Finn sat there and smoked about a hour I guess . Symanthia was there in the bed asleep . Before we started home Finn said , " Tillie , I want you to take Symanthia to a doctor . Take her to Doc Allbright . She 's got a bad disease . She give it . to me so damn bad I had to drag around like a broke-down hog for five or six days . " " A bad disease , " Tillie screamed , " my God , what is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TheP208low-down curly-headed son-of-a-bitch . I wish he was in hell goddam him . I ai n't got no money to pay no doctor with . I wash for fifty cents a day all the washin I can get over among the town people . I get all I can to wash at night to feed these little youngins and clothe them . " " Take her away , " said Finn , " the doctor can wait for his money . Save her . I know she 's sufferin like a son-of-a-bitch . I know I suffered nightmares and lizards and striped snakes . Do n't let her eat no apples for it neither . " I hated to , but I had to tell her that she 'd have to move off the place . When Mick found it out , hell would be to pay . She 'd better get off while times was good . Get off right now . Soon as she could . Move to town where her washins would be handier and she would n't have to carry them across the hill home . Finn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we all lit our pipes with a piece of rich pine kindlin . Finn and me went back across the hill home . Tillie told me that the doctor said that Symanthia did n't have no bad disease . She said Symanthia had strained herself with the ax cuttin wood the next mornin . She said that was the way lies got started . Finn had come over there and told it . She did n't want to hear no more of it . I said right there at the milk gap , " I 'll go with you to anotherdoctor and pay the doctor myself and let you see she 's got a bad disease and she give it to Finn . W'y he wallered over everythin in this barn lot when he was doctorin it . It took his breath , medicine Doc Allbright give him did . That 's why he fell off here so . He looked so pale . He walked stiffleggedlike a rabbit . " Tillie never said a word . Next day Reece come and ast for our mules to move with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barn lot . Go put the harness on ' em and right up there is the wagon . Hitch to it . " He went on and got the mules . He took two loads to town that day . He took the last load the next mornin . He moved his corn and fodder later on . Yesterday we got Finn off to Wormwood University to make a doctor out'n him . I looked in his pocketbook to see if he had the sixty-seven dollars we got out'n the cows . He did n't have but forty-nine . I paid the doctor for him with cream money . I skinted my table . I skinted my little children 's back to get that bill paid so his Pa would n't know it till he got away . I did n't want Mick to go over there and cause a lot more trouble . Have a lot more sickness and trouble in the world . There 's enough of it already for a mother with eleven children like I 've raised and a set of boys wild as a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finn left . What a man do n't know wo n't hurt him . P210SNOW covers the earth like a thick heavy blanket . The bare trees stand like silent wooden pegs stuck in the snow . They bend creakingly when the wind whistles through their leafless tops . Icicles hang to the eaves like white silver spears . There is one icicle bigger than the rest at the end of the wooden drain pipe . " It 's a bad night for a bellin , " says Finn , " I do n't see what makes people want to get married in weather cold as this weather is . Zero weather and T. J. Lester and Daisy Bee Redfernjumped-the-broom and have to stay in a house you could pitch a dog between the unchinked logs . " Finn throws down a fork of clover hay to the mules from the barn loft and blows his knuckles warm with his breath . His lips are blue . His face is red . He is so tall he bends down to miss the barn-loft rafters . " It 's time they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other eight months , " I says to Finn , " no use to court their lives away and then not marry . We 'd better hurry up and get the mules ready if we 're goin to the bellin . Got to curry them and harness them . There 's a good moon tonight and we 'll not miss the road . " We feed the mules clover hay in the manger . We put yellowears of corn in the feed boxes . We walk up the path cut through the snow to the house . We have to clean out the guns and get the shells and get all set for the bellin . Pa is settin before the wood fire . His red face in his hands . He is lookin into the tiny blue flames at the end of the fore stick . His eyes are half closed . He seems to be dreamin . We walk quietly so we wo n't wake Pa . We tiptoe across the room . " Where you boys a-goin , " says Pa , comin out of a drowsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know you boys are up to somethin . No dances , remember that . Steve Bocook 's boy got cut to the holler twice over on Long Branch last night and you boys ai n't goin to no more dances . "  | " Pa , do n't get so rosy all at once . We ai n't goin to no dance . Did n't you know T. J. Lester and Daisy Bee Redfern got married today and we 're goin to bell them tonight , " says Finn . " I did n't know it , " says Pa , " another poorhouse started . Old Bill-Ike Lester will have to keep that lazy good-for-nothin boy of hisn and his wife too . That 's the kind that wants a woman . Them no-count kind . He would n't work if you put him at a ' lassie mill where he could sop the pan all day . I had him to work for me and I screamed like a panter and run him home to get rid of him . Now he marries Daisy Bee Redfern , pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of off . " " You got married once , did n't you , Pa ? " says Finn , " and what did Grandpa say about it ? He said you was n't worth powder and lead to shoot you . Now he says you 're the best in-law he 's got and he would n't give you for any of his own boys . He used to call you Tom Slackwater 's bull before you married Mom . He said you gallivanted over this neighborhood it was a Lord 's sight to see  --  playin a old fiddle and pickin a guitar and dancin . He said you did n't care nothin for the field and the plow and did n't have a head on you for to make a good girl a livin . " " I got belled , " says Pa , " now if you boys are goin to a bellin , go on , but be damn sure you do n't go to no more of them square dances till the Carpers and the Filsons quit cuttinat them dances . Somebody 's goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . You know that . You do n't know how hard it is to raise a boy and get him cut all to pieces or get him killed until you boys get old as I am . " We go upstairs to dress . Finn leads the way . Before we get to the head of the stairs Finn says to me , " Quinn , did you know Pa 's gettin cranky as all get out ? Pa 's gettin old . He used to drink and fight and carry on somethin awful . He does yet when he gets lit up just right . When he ai n't lit up , he just sets around and fusses . " We put on our boots , our heavy sheep-skin coats , our wool caps and our scarfs . We put on our mittens . We are ready . P212The moon filters through the window like a white water . It covers everything . We could see to shoot a rabbit on the snow . Clouds are blue as ice on mountain water . Moon is bright as a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goin to be as cold as blue blazes , " says Finn , " better take some of them heavy quilts along to put over our laps . It 's goin to be mighty cold a-ridin in that sled . Ten degrees below zero and it 's a damp cold along that river . It 's a mighty damp cold . The girls will get mighty cold if we do n't take quilts along to cover them up good from feet to ears . " We carry four good heavy wool-padded quilts downstairs and out to the sled . We lay them down on the snow . The moon shines down through the bare apple-tree twigs . Chickens roostin on the icy limbs nudge each other and grumble somethinwe can not understand . They look as big as black and white stumps between us and the moon . " You fix up the sled and get the guns in it , " says Finn , " and I 'll go harness the mules . I can do it quicker . Barnie ai n't used to you and you do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mouth . I can do that quicker and you fix up the sled . " " All right with me , " I says to brother Finn as he runs down the path to the barn , crunchin the snow beneath each step . I carry corn shucks from the corn crib and put in the bottom of the sled and I brush the snow off the quilts and put them in the sled . I go into the house and carry out Finn 's automatic shotgun and my pump gun . The blue barrels gleam blue in the moonlight . They glisten like a blacksnake when it sheds its tough skin in the springtime and the bright spring sun first shines on its new coat of skin . I go back and get the Columbia single-barrel shotgun that has worn out three plungers through three generations of use . Barrel is thin as tissue paper and it is sightless . It is almost dangerous to shoot , but we shoot it anyway . It has been to many many bellins and we feel like it is entitled to fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it left to knock off a shell . We take two Smith &; Wessons with long barrels that gleam in the moonlight . P2131 can hear the harness jinglin . It rattles in the icy air like tiny bells . It is Finn comin up the path with the mules . He has them harnessed ready to hitch to the sled . In a minute we will be racin over the snow . Finn backs the mules into their places  --  Barnie on the off side and Jack on the near side . He hooks the trace chains to the single trees and I fasten the breast yoke to the collars and fasten the sled tongue to the breast yoke . It will be slick tonight and the mules will have to hold back the sled on the downhill runs , for we 've no time to rough lock . " Stand still , Barnie , " says Finn , " my but this mule is wantin to go . He 's cold . He 's feelin his oats . He wants to go . A cold mule always wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say to Finn . " Wait a minute , " says Finn , " till I hang a couple of cowbellsto the corners of the sled and all the people that do n't know about the bellin will know about it and will be out followinus or findin out where the bellin is . " Finn runs into the smoke house and gets two cowbells . He fastens them to the back corners of the sled . We jump into the sled , sit on the coffee-sack padded board seat and put a quilt apiece over our laps . Finn takes the check lines . We are off  --  over the snow for a seven-mile ride to the bellin . The bells jingle till Pa comes to the door . We can see him standin between the firelight and us . He says somethin  --  we can not understand , but it sounded like he said , " Be careful with the mules and all the shootin . " I can hear bells behind us  --  louder than the church bells on Sunday mornin . The blue sky above us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered over the white mounds of mountains like the black blotches on a white bird-dog 's back . The mules are on their toes  --  goin at full pace . The wheezin of the frozen sled around the curves down the Hollow and the rattlin of the harness and the ringin of the bells over the crusted snow ! " All right , Barnie , " says Finn , and he touches his harness tailpiece slightly with a slap of the reins , " no shirkin here tonight . Not so fast , Jack  --  not so fast , boy , over this slippery road . "  |p214I  can see the mules ' breath like two huge streams of smoke blown out upon the blue icy air in December . I can see Finn 's breath . It goes out in two little curls of blue smoke  --  one curl from each nostril and one goes to one side of his face and the other goes to the other side of his face . " Do you reckon Sadie and Dot will be ready when we get to Callihan 's ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told her this evenin to be ready by seven tonight . I guess she 'll be ready . " " You know Pa 's gettin old , sure as the world , " says Finn , " W'y he said to me the other day , You boys ai n't got big paths built to the hog pen and to the barn and milk shed and wood shed like you have traipsin paths over the hills to the square dances . You 're always on the gad . You want to run with your chins up and barrels of work around this place to do . ' I thought that was so funny . Pa 's gettin old . He ai n't young no more like he used to be . " We pass the peddler well and turn the corner on one sled runner . Then we shoot up a straight piece of road . I can see the snow like powdered dust fly up from the mules ' hoofs . Callihan 's house is in sight . The lamp is burnin by the window . We pull up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls , " says Finn , " while I knock the balls of snow and ice from the mules ' hoofs . They need to be toed and corked for weather like this . " I go in and get Dot and Sadie . They are ready for once when we want to go some place . " All bloomed out , ai n't you , Dot , " I say as I help her turn up her fur collar and tie her scarf around her neck . " A winter blossom , " says Dot , " and we 've been waitin on you slow pokes for a hour . Where have you been all this time ?  --  " " Had to finish feedin and milkin and get away from Pa . He thought we 's headin for another dance . Let 's hurry . We want to be there when the first gun is fired . " Dot and me takes the back seat . Sadie climbs in beside of Finn . He has trimmed the snow off the mules ' feet and is back in the sled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time to do nothin when he wants to get some place . We put the heavy quilts over our laps and we set kindly close , you know . " All set , " says Finn . " Ready , " says Dot , " let 's dash ' em over the snow . " " We heard them bells a mile away , " says Sadie , " and I told Dot you slow pokes was on your way . " " You 're wakin up everybody in the Hollow on a still night like this with them big bells , " says Dot . " That 's what we want to do , " says Finn . " Let ' em know Daisy Bee Redfern and T. J. Lester kicked-the-broomstick . " " Jumped-the-broomstick , you mean , " says Sadie . " Set close and shut up the gab , " I say to Dot . " That Barnie mule , " says Finn , " is fleet as any horse in this country when you make it seven miles instead of one or two . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things for slick snowy roads . A mule never falls . He 's as sure-footed as a possum . " We breathe the icy air into our lungs . We are feelin warm close to each other under a double of thick wool-padded quilts . The moon is above us in the blue sky . The fields up on the mountain slopes where there is n't timber is light as day . " Whoa , boys , " says Finn , " give me that gun , Quinn , and hold the mules . " I hold the mules and Finn stands up in the sled bed and takes careful aim at something on the bank . " Pow ! " The mules stand on their hind legs and snort against the checklines . I hold them . There is the smell of powder . There is a cloud of black smoke from the throat of the gun that followed the belchin blaze . " I got him , " says Finn , " see him kickin by that stump up there . I wanted to see what I could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wait till I jump out and get it . " Finn runs across the blanket of granulated sugar grains of snow . He goes through the sheep fence up through a cluster of pipe-stem shoemake sprouts by a stump and brings back a kickin rabbit . He throws it in the back of the sled on the straw . He takes the reins . We are off again . P216The mules throw their heads into the air and snort . They do n't like the smell of gunpowder . We are ridin along the Sandy River now . It is a cold wind that stings our faces from the water . The mules are in full gallop on the road . We 'll soon be at Lester 's house . The bells are ringin and the snow is flyin . I do n't have much time for the noise , for I am busy holdin Dot in the sled as we swing around the curves . She holds me when we swing to her side and the sled tries to throw me out . I hold her when the swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can see the blue-snake barrels of the guns gleam in the moonlight . They are standin in the corner of the sled . The bells are ringin , the harness is jinglin , the wind is blowin little clouds of the white flakes into our faces . Snow follows the sled in a blowin swirl like dust behind a rubber-tired hack . " Here at last , " says Finn , as we turn in the lane past the barn and up to a double-log cabin . Horses stand hitched to the white fence posts . Sleds without teams and drivers are left all over the barn lot and the wood yard . The windows of the double-log cabin gleam yellow in the moonlight . There is noise enough in the house to explode the log walls . " Take your mules out , Sonny , " says Bill-Ike Lester playin with his white chin whiskers and comin closer to the sled . " Wished to my God if it ai n't old Mick Powderjay 's boys and Effie Callihan 's girls . Come right on in , children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll put the mules in and give them hay in good warm stalls . " " What must we do with the quilts ? " " Leave them right in the sled , children . Nobody will harm a quilt here tonight . All you got to watch here is your licker . You know men has a hankerin for licker and they 'll steal licker . But they wo n't bother quilts , you know . What would men want with quilts ? " Dot and Sadie jump from the sled and limber up their bodies by trampin quickly about the sled and crunchin the snow beneath their feet . I rub my mittened hands and then help unhook the trace chains and do up the checklines . Uncle Bill-Ike Lester unfastens the breast yoke and Finn leads the mules from the sled and gives them to Uncle Bill-Ike to put in stalls . We get the guns and the pistols and Dot takes the cowbells loose from the sled . We walk through the gate toward the noise . " They 're gone , " says Freddie Hix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked every place for them . " " Who 's gone ? " I say to Freddie . " Daisy Bee and T. J. ai n't been heard tell of around here tonight , " says Freddie , " and we 've looked all over the place for them . We 've looked behind the meal barrels and the flour barrels , in the barn , the corn crib  --  upstairs under the beds , behind the quilt stacks , behind the dressers , the doors , the curtains over the presses  --  We 've looked in the cellar , the smoke house in the ' backer barn , the sheep shed , the cattle barn  --  We 've looked every place there is to look . We ca n't find them nowheres . " " Do you reckon they got away , " says Finn , " when they just got married this evenin and they ai n't but one road leadinout of here ? Somebody would a-seen them leavin surely . You know they did n't walk . Do you reckon they 're hidin out over at Short 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent searchers over there and they 've looked the places clean . They ca n't find hide nor hair of them any place . " " Do n't reckon they went to roost with the chickens ? " says Mart Hensley . " Look what a crowd here and no bellin . " We go into the house . All the neighborhood is here . Here is Kate with Tom Longsmith . Here is Eif Shelton with Martha Sowards . Here is Chicken Gullett with Symanthia Skidmore when he ought to be with Lizzie Porter . Don Hix is here , Sammie Banks , Luke Endsor , Viddie Pembroke . The house is filled like a beehive . They are all movin around like bees without a queen . " I know exactly where them two is , " says Alexander Pitts . " I was at this very place fifty years ago to a bellin and I know right where they hid . It 's a good warm place . I remember that night fifty years ago was a night just as cold as this night . TheyP218got a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this place and if you 'll elect me captain of the bellin crowd I 'll get them for you . " " You 're elected captain right now , " says Herman Moore . " You 're elected captain right now , " cries go up from all over the house . " Take us to them , " says Eif Shelton . Alexander Pitts runs his big hand through his bird's-nest beard . " Follow me , " Alexander says . The beard and whiskers around his mouth muffle the sounds of his words . We go out behind the house . The big chimney is built onto the bigger lower half where the fireplace is , and it leans away from the house big enough for two to hide behind . " A dollar to a dime , boys , right up there behind that chimney 's where they 're at , " says Captain Alexander Pitts combinhis beard with his big sticks-of-stove-wood fingers . " Get me a clothesline prop and watch me twist ' em out'n there like they 's a he and she rabbit . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " before I twist you'se out'n there like a couple of rabbits in a holler tree ! " There is frozen silence like the ice in the creeks . Not a breath stirs . Not a sound . " Come out'n there and we wo n't twist you . If you do n't come we 'll twist every dud off'n your backs and ride you T. J. on a rail till you holler for mercy . Now you answer me . This is Captain Alexander Pitts tellin you to come out and give yourselves up to the crowd while times is good . " There is silence behind the chimney and among the breathlessstarin crowd . " They ai n't in that place , Captain Alexander Pitts , " says Bill-Ike Lester as he comes around the corner of the house from the barn . " They are in that place , Bill-Ike . I come to this place to a bellin fifty years ago . They hid on us . A big snow was on the ground like this one tonight . We looked every place for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go home and old Lem Sperry come out and says , Boys , there 's one place we ai n't looked . ' He tried to see behind the place and he could n't . He ast me to fotch him a wilier pole and I got a fishin pole that was layin up in that big oak tree over there . I le stuck it behind there and he begin to twist the pole . And he says : Boys , I 've got ' em . They 're here . ' And he twisted ' cm right out up there on them rocks . Fetch me that clotheslineprop and I 'll show you who ai n't in behind that chimney and who is . " Jerry Pratt brings the long clothesline pole . It creaks frozen like in the icy wind . The crowd shuffles their feet on the crunchin snow . All eyes starin up the chimney and the big moon in the sky above the chimney . The icicles hangin to the caves glisten like silver roofin nails in the moonlight . Captain Alexander Pitts takes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight in the wind , then twists it behind the chimneyrocks into the dark hole . " I feel ' em , " says Captain Alexander , " I feel ' em shore as God made little green apples . There they are . They are aholdinmy pole . The fish has got the bait . What did I tell you ? Now , what did I say  --  a dollar to a dime . Want a bet , any of you ? Wait till I twist ' em a little . They 'll have to come or holler . " Alexander twists the pole with his big hands , his beard is bent by the passin wind like the twigs on the oak tree . His head is lifted  --  face up and his blue eyes glued onto the hole between the big chimney and the house . " There they are , " the cry went up from the crowd with thin puffs of white air streamin from each mouth toward the moon as T. J. come up to the moonlit edge of the hole with the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come down from there or we 'll ride you on a rail like we did old Abraham Howard 's boy Ezekiel fifty years ago . Come out'n there right now  --  you two pretty redbirds and we wo n't do nothin to you to amount to anything . " " Get that ladder from under the house there and set it up against these rocks so Daisy Bee can get down and we 'll come without being twisted any more with that pole . It catched meP220right in the back and it hurt a little bit  --  " says T. J. , his lips curvin to a broad laugh and his teeth showin in the half dark and half moonlight , his eyes shinin like a tomcat 's eyes in the dark . Millard Pierce gets the ladder from under the floor they used to get up behind the chimney . Daisy Bee went up the ladder , T. J. climbed the logs and held to the chimney rocks after he 'd scooted the ladder back under the floor . Millard puts the ladder upon the chimney , Daisy Bee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the big log house and sets her tiny feet on the ladder steps and starts down , her face always turned from the laughin crowd . T. J. follows her down the ladder , holdin to one of her hands . " Here we are , " says T. J. as they step on the snow . " We 've heard every word you said about us and it 's been hard to keep Daisy Bee from laughin at you . I had to pinch her and make her mad at me to keep her from bustin out and laughin --  " " Yes , bustin out and laughin , " says Captain Alexander Pitts , " I know how a young man pinched his bride the first night to keep her from laughin . You ai n't no more pinched that gal of Bill-Ike Lester 's than I pinched her . I 's married one time , my boy , and I know how it goes . I 'm married yet to the same pigeon . Her wings ai n't a-droopin one bit . She flies the same now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back there she is smokin her pipe . Ast her if I pinched her to make her quit laughin when we 's a hidin out behind the smoke house to keep from bein belled . " Everybody laughs and Daisy Bee turns her head and runs into the house . T. J. follows Daisy Bee into the house . " Gets your guns , everybody , and plow pints and cowbells , wash pans , water buckets , wash tubs  --  everybody  --  hear  --  let 's start the racket right now . This is the orders from your CaptainAlexander Pitts . " " How about the automatics , pump guns , and Winchesters , Captain  --  do n't you want us in front ? " says Finn , " and the wash-tub and wash-pan thumpers behind us so no one will get shot --  " " Yes , " says the Captain , " and I want all horses and mules cleared from that fence before this shootin starts . I want them in the barn , Bill-Ike . We 'll have a lot of people here that 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own sleds home , you know , and some ca n't walk home seven and eight miles this cold night . " " I 'll have room for all them the horses and mules leaves . I can hang ' em up on a nail , " says Bill-Ike goin to the fence to unhitch the remainin horses and mules and lead them into the stalls in the big cattle barn . Finn 's automatic goes to crackin in my ears before I get started and then I turn my pump gun loose at the moon in the sky . Of all flames in the world them guns belch them from heir long slim bellies . I did n't know shotguns could make so much noise . " Shoot right at that little boy in the moon , " says Captain Alexander , " dime to a dollar you ca n't hit him . " Behind us was the beatin of tin pans and wash tubs and water buckets and cowbells enough to make a person go deef . The most noise I ever heard in one place in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't shoot it . It got hot as a poker after you punch the brands down with it . Finn was right beside of me and he says , " My hands ! My hands they 're burnin off a-hold of this gun . " We walk around the house once and unload our guns and have Tim Nipp 's boy Sneed to reload our guns while we empty our pistols . Then we let the guns cool while we use the pistols . We come back around the house and pick up the pump gun and the automatic and empty them . We use seventeenboxes of shells there before we know it . Guns right beside of us blazin . The smell of old black powder nearly makes me puke . But we stay in ranks right with ' em , me and Finn do , and we do our part of the shootin . We did n't come to let anybodymake more noise than we make . Them cowbells went like all the milk cows , for seventeen miles square is on a belled stampede right through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand stands of bees . The whole air above our heads is black with gun-powder smoke . Above our heads is red as ox blood from the gun flames . We can feel the snow and the empty shellsP222beneath our feet . We could n't hear the snow beneath our feet , like we did when we come into the house . The empty shells felt like corncobs beneath our feet like corncobs around a hog pen . Captain Alexander runs in front of the guns in front and holds up a pine torch and waves it . He says : " Stay your guns , boys . No more shootin . The mules and the horses is about to tear the barn down and the dogs has all left the place scared to death barkin , and the cats all left the place a-squallin  --  Now put your guns away and come inside for treat . " We bring our guns down out ' n the air and empty them right there . We take them inside and stack them in the corner . Here is old Fannie Spry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers its bottom like a Plymouth Rock settin hen covers her eggs . She is smokin her pipe and tellin about when her and John got married how they belled them louder than we belled Daisy Bee and T. J. " Right this way , boys , " says Bill-Ike Lester , " right this way . " We follow him into the pantry . The keg is there . It is uncovered . Dippers hang all over the sixteen-gallon keg . " It 's the best licker you ever put your tongue to . Watch it , though , it will turn your heels up . I made it . I know what it is . T. J. wo n't get married but once I hope  --  I never have  --  and I want you all to have a good time . I knowed they 's behind that chimney . I helped put them up there . I shoved the ladder back under the floor . It 's all a little fun , you know , boys . Boys , for you fellars that do n't like licker , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of strawberry wine , one of blackberry wine and right over here is a sixty-gallon barrel of hard apple cider . Watch your licker and cider . They do n't mix any better than Democrats and Republicans . " Bill-Ike Lester walks out and leaves us in the pantry . Gourd dippers are hangin on the rims of the kegs and the barrel . There 's plenty of dippers and wine , licker , cider before us . It is like leadin the bulls to the river and tellin them to drink . In the front room Liddie Lester is passin around a washtub filled with twists of tobacco for the women to smoke . " Help yourself , Aunt Fannie , you and Aunt Liddie  --  this terbackerp223wo n't bite your tongue . It 's burley terbacker . Raised it right back gander on the Sam Jones pint in that new ground piece of land . It 's sweet as sugar . Take you a few twists with you . Stick them in your pockets for tomorrow and next day . " " All right , girls and children  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candy come right this way and get it . Lassie candy and candy from the store . " She carries a heaped-up dish pan of candy through the room and sets it on the table . There are chocolate drops , gum candy , sugar candy , peppermintstick candy and ' lassie candy that the candy party made two nights before the weddin . The girls and the children walk over and help themselves . " Cigars a-plenty for the men . Cigars a-plenty rolled from burley terbacker and taste-bud terbacker . We made ' em for this bellin . Help yourselves . Right here they are , " says Eif Hammonds , as he carries a split-bottom feed basket with a flour poke torn open and spread over the basket and the cigars heaped up on it . " Here 's popcorn and lassie balls right this way , " says Mary Lester , " for anybody that wants them . Help yourself to them . " The old and the young help themselves . The old women sit on chairs and on the edges of the beds and smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smoke goes out in tiny swirls until the yellow glow of the lamplight is nearly dimmed . There is the sparklin of the fore stick on the wood fire , the tiny blazes cracklin and the big blazes leapin up between the filler wood and the back stick . The moon hangs over the house like a galvanized wash pan gleamin in the sun . The snow is white in the moonlight . The chickens " queer-queer " from their branches on the trees at the noise in the house below , a house at this time of night that is supposed to be silent as a mouse save the barkin of the hound dogs at the boards that the wind creaks on the barn . " Everybody help yourself , " says Bill-Ike Lester , " there is a time for everything , the Good Book says , and this is the time to enjoy yourselves . There is a time to dance and a time to sing and a time to marry  --  and a time to bell ' em . "   " A time to bell ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the pantry door  --  " It 's the best time I ever had in my life . I 'm drunk shore as T. J. 's married  --  I 'm drunk . My best old Pal 's married . " " When he gets past goin , " says Bill-Ike , " put him in that feather bed in the back room . Give a drunk man a feather bed tonight long as the feather beds last . T. J. 's married and he 's my last of eleven to marry . Want you people to have a good time . Drink and be merry . Tomorrow you know  --  you might not be here . Me and the old lady had a big time at our bellin and we 've give all our children a big bellin and a heifer and a feather-bed tick to start housekeepin on . That 's what we got when we went to housekeepin . We got the bed tick yet and seed from that heifer is right out there at the barn in them cows . I hope T. J. lives with his turtledove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and downs of forty-nine years . I do n't believe in puttin asunder what God has jined together . " " Everybody had plenty , " says Captain Alexander Pitts , " to eat and to drink and to smoke . If you ai n't , let us know right now . If you have , let us know and we 're ready to start a little shindig here before mornin . We got Tim Snoddy with his talkin fiddle to give us a few steps and Jim Runyan with his banjer and a couple of guitars . They 're lit a little and rarin to go . " " Let 's start the dance , " says Toby Spry . " On with the dance , " says Liddie Lester . " All right . Make yourselves useful well as good-lookin and carry out the house plunder into the back room . All right , everybody , help a little and make the work light . " We carry the furniture into the back room . Tim tunes hisfiddle and resins his bow . Jim Runyan threads a new stringonto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thisstring and that string and loosens this one and tightens that . " We are ready , " says Tim , " ready to go . Get two sets outhere and let 's fill up the floor . " And he starts " Birdie , " oneof Kentucky 's best dance tunes . I get Dot . Finn comes in with Sadie . He is staggerin a wee bit . He has a taste-bud cigar in his mouth , puffin the smoke like a dinky mine engine into little swirls of blue that thin when they reach the high ceilin . " Who 's callin ? " says Finn . " Do n't know , " says Tim . " Let Finn Powderjay call , " says T. J. " He 's a good enough caller to call any man 's dance . " " Just as you say , " says Finn , " I 'm not carin right now . " " Call the dance then and let 's get to movin here before midnight . From now on until the chickens begins to crow ai n't long to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finn , " let 's fill up the floor . All right , we want two more couples . Grab your girls and get out here . " " Here they come . " " All right , turn that fiddle loose . Let ' er go , let cry , let talk . We 're ready and a-rarin to go --  " Tim puts the fiddle to his shoulder and he looks straight to the wall on the other side of the room . He lifts the bow , starts whippin it across the strings . The banjo follows , talkin right up to the fiddle and then the guitars . " That Birdie 's plain enough , boys , till you can see the bird , " I says . Captain Alexander Pitts is standin beside of Tim with his ear down to the fiddle . " This man is a fiddler . I used to saw around a fiddle a little bit myself . " " Grab your partner , " says Finn . " I take my lickerAnd I take it straight , Grab your HoneyAnd pat her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bodies swing to the rhythm of the music . The whole house seems to jar from its foundations . Dust flies up from the floor to the ceilin . There is the fiddle sounds and the banjo that are nearly drowned by the merry voices .   " Ground-hog leather Snead without a blade , All hands together And let 's promenade . " The old sit back and laugh and pat their feet and clap their hands to the time of the music . They laugh and smoke their pipes and the cigars and watch the dance go on . " When I was a young man , " says Captain Alexander Pitts , " I never missed a dance . We danced a lot harder than the young folks dance today . We had a big time . That was nearly fifty years ago and we had two dances a week . People could dance in them days . " " When I was a boy , " says Bill-Ike Lester , " people enjoyed themselves more than they do today . W'y you ca n't have a dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somebody gets plugged before daylight . Somebody gets knifed . Something happens everytime we have a dance . I think they need us old folks out to tame the young bucks . We could be a lot ' f help to them . " " Daisy Bee and T. J. lead out . The Ocean Wave . " The fiddle speaks to the crowd . The dance is growin livelier . " Put the jug up there by Tim 's nose . Then he can fiddle , " says Jerry Pratt as he wipes the sweat from his face with his coat sleeve . " He 's fiddlin fit for a King , " says Captain Alexander Pitts . " I 'd like to know who 'd want better fiddlin but a hiram-skirm . " " Ca n't you take a joke , Captain ? " says Jerry . The old women laugh . Aunt Fannie Spry laughed . She shook all over and blew smoke from her long-stemmed clay pipe in tiny swirls . " Hickory log and a poplar stump , Hole in the floor and everybody jump , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meet your Honey and promenade around . " The dance goes on . Finn calls the dance to the beautiful rhythm of " Birdie . " Feet hit on the puncheon floor . The slip- 2 7per heels touch lightly . The tall men and the slender women sway swiftly to the fast music . " First couple out and circle four . Right hands crossed and circle four  --  Left hands crossed and circle fourAnd step right through the old side door . Opposite partners swing and waltz around Now swing your partner and waltz again  --  Swing ' ern right and do n't get wrongAnd meet your Honey and waltz her around . " Swing Little Susie and Mary AnnHurry up Daisy Bee . Do n't leave your man . " " I feel like gettin right in there , " says Bill-Ike Lester , " I feel like me and my woman is young again . She 's a lot purtier than she used to be , I know that . I believe we could get our bones limbered up and do about as good as them young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Alexander ? " " Believe to my soul I could , " says Captain Alexander , strokin his long white beard and blowin smoke from his beard-covered lips . " Believe to my soul I could dance all night when I hear that music I used to dance when I was a boy --  " " All right , " says Finn , " let 's have the old folks to dance this set . Let 's set back and watch them go through the old steps like they did forty years ago . Fill up the floor . " " We 'll limber up our old bones sure enough , " says Captain Alexander . " I 'll swing my pigeon , " says Bill-Ike Lester , " not a feather dirty and she can fly like she used to . Come out here , Honey . Let 's show ' em how we used to dance before we ever knowed we 'd have the eleventh boy to marry and us to be dancin at his weddin . Come right here . You look spryer than you ever did in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to that jug again , Bill-Ike , " says Effie , " that 's why I 'm so purty to you . " " All right  --  let ' er go , Tim , " says Lumber Hix out on the floor with fat Fannie Spry . " We used to dance the night longp228together , did n't we , Fannie ? We ai n't changed but a little bit . Got a little fatter and our hair 's changed its color a little bit , but we are about as young as we 've ever been . We 're just sixteen tonight . " Tim takes a drink from the jug . He braces his foot against the floor and starts pattin with one foot and to whip the fiddle strings over the same tune , " Birdie , " again . There is laughter and clappin of hands from the young as the old start the dance . " Watch old Uncle Bill-Ike Lester , " says Dot . " Watch him swing Aunt Effie . A good-lookin old couple  --  hair is white as cotton  --  havin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wonder if you and me will be dancin like that fifty years from today ! " " I do n't know , " I says to Dot , " when did we become engagedanyway ? " " There they go , " says Millard , " Daisy Bee and T. J. slippin out . " " Let ' em go , " says Jerry Pratt . " Do n't you know they want to be together some tonight . Let ' em go back to the chimney hole . " " They 're gettin in a sled . " " Let ' em get . They ca n't be together with this crowd . It 's two o'clock in the mornin now . Did you know that ? " " Not so fast , " says Aunt Kate Fields , " ca n't take it like I used to . Must be terbacker that cuts my wind . A little fat too , you know . Weight kindly comes upon a body when she gets older . " Uncle Bill-Ike is dancin all around Aunt Effie . He is showin his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good as the young . Watch that old man dance , wo n't you ! " They follow through the steps of the dance . Time has slowed them down . The white hair tossin in the dimly lighted room . The air full of tobacco smoke . The young bucks comin and goin from the pantry . The music a little slower for the old than it was for the young . But they move through the steps and the dust flies to the ceilin . " Havin a good time , ai n't they , " says Millard , " beatin the young . Watch them old Pap 's and Ma 's of yours and mine cutP229the pigeon wing and Waltz the Hall , ' wo n't you ! They know their stuff . Got the old Kentucky Waltz the Hall ' in their blood and they 'll never get it out . They 'll dance when they get to Heaven shore as the world . They 'll dance right through the pearly gates and up to God on His throne . " " All right . Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Finn . " Fill up the floor fast . I see we got one couple , the Bride and the Groom , missin . It 's time they 's hidin out  --  Anothercouple to take their place . " The old couples come back to their chairs puffin and blowin . They come back wipin sweat from their wet foreheads . " Hot out there a-dancin , ai n't it ? " says Effie Lester , " a lot hotter than a body would think for a night like this . " " Well , let 's watch the young take another set . This time the grapevine twist . That is a hard dance . We have to give up everything to the young , " says Captain Alexander Pitts , " we have to give up our farms , the dance , the right to make our laws . They have to carry on for us after a while and we have to look back on the past and talk about the things we 've done and ai n't done . The young women have to bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We turn that over to the young too . My wife 's just borne us nine . " There is the rapid swirl of the swift mountain music , Leather Breetches . Partners swing and promenade . The floor creaks and the dust flies . There is swift life in the mountain young . The dance will soon be ended . It is time now  --  the last set is comin to a close . The bellin is over . " Stay all night with us , everybody . Ai n't got two good hours to sleep now . You 'd just as well put in the rest of the night with me . Ai n't got beds enough , but I can hang you up on a nail I guess when the beds run out , " says Uncle Bill-Ike Lester . " We just got to be movin , " says Finn , " we got a good seven miles ahead of us yet this mornin over the frosted frozen snow . " " You 'd better get a little toddy to warm up , my boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep you het-upP230after gettin hot at this dance and goin out into the cold air along that river . " " All right , " says Finn , " we 'll take a little snort along with us . Finn goes back to get us a mornin dram and I go out with a load of our guns . They are cold now , the long blue barrels glimmer in the moonlight . The girls are puttin on their wraps . Uncle Bill-Ike helps us to get our mules and horses out of the barn . They are cold and want to go . A mule always wants to go toward home . There is the laughter of the crowd goin home and the hand shakes , the words , " Come over and see us . " " Thank you , we will , you come over and see us . " And " Good-by " and the girls leapin into the saddles , and behind the saddles . Plenty of the mules are carryin double over the slick roads . There are teams of mules the boys are leadin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The moon is low above the snow-clad hills . It is bright as day and the sugar-coated earth is silent save for the partin voices , the neighin of the horses and the hee-hawin of the mules to one another at partin . When horses and mules part from one another , they seem to part like people with a sort of friendships with good-bys to one another as they often part not to see each other again . We are ready to go , guns in the back of the sled on the straw , quilts dusted of snow and straw neatly spread in the bottom of the sled bed . Finn , Dot and Sadie come from the house mittened and wrapped against the icy mornin winter wind . " Ready , " says Finn . " Ready , " I say . " You take ' em back , " says Finn . " Suits me , " I say , " I 'd like to have a little of Uncle Bill-Ike 's mornin reviver to put a little life in me after the dance . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slushes in the jar . I can see it bead in the moonlight . The jar is warm . " It is good licker , " says Finn , " and a little will help you over this slick road while a lot might hinder you . " " A body do n't have to hold these mules in the road or rein them anyway goin back . They 'll go themselves . Just turn them loose and tie the lines to the seat board , " I says , " and they 'll take us there . " Dot sits close to me . I hold the reins in my mittened hands . The moon hangs in the sky . The wind is cold . Ten million stars are in the sky . It is so clear and cold . The mules go at a full gallop , the creakin of the sled around the curves and the jinglin of the harness and the night wind in the trees are about all one can hear . The black barren trees are studded against the hill slopes like bright stars are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the creamy light . We see a rabbit run across the road , rabbits afraid of the hunters ' guns make use of the night to gnaw the frozen bark from the sassafras sprouts at night . " We forgot the cowbells , " says Dot . " You 're right , we did , " says Finn . The mules keep up a swift gallop around the curves and the sled swerves this way and that . I 'm close to Dot . She 's close to me . I do n't know about Finn and Sadie . They are under the quilts . The chickens are crowin at Barry Underwood 's for daylight . The night is over . P231PARSIE lives right across the road from me . She moved there last Spring . Her man , Peg-Leg Jake Mullins , rented the place from old Bill Sizemore . I think Bill is wrong in the head to rent to Peg-Leg Jake . He 's the laziest man in the world . When he was burnin brush last March he went to sleep close to a brush pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brush pile . The fire slipped up like a mouse in the kitchen safe and caught Peg-Leg 's wooden leg on fire . It popped and burned like dry shoemake . It was locust wood . It burned right off his body before he could get the strap unbuckled . Peg-Leg hobbled in on a stick to the house . He went to plow one day . He went to sleep when the day got up . The peckerwoods drilled in his wooden leg for worms . That 's the God 's truth . Old Bill Sizemore must be wrong in the head to rent a farm to him . He 'll run old Bill in debt instead of makin money to pay the taxes on the place . I could tell Parsie was goin to have a baby . I knowed it all the time . I remember last Spring how my man Blue used to hunt with Peg-Leg and Timothy . Say , that Timothy Muscovitewas a man I never did like . I never did like that name . Timothy is a big hairy man , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks funny beside of my man , Blue . My man looks more like somebody . I 've got the only decent-lookin man in this neighborhood . I 'd like to see a woman who could love Peg-Leg or Timothy . Peg-Leg 's got a fine fuzz on his face where he never shaves . I always say his face is poor as some old land that we got that wo n't bring weeds and sprouts . His face wo n't grow whiskers . He 's not got a tooth in his head that I 've ever seen . His thin jaws just blab-blab and blubberwhen he talks like the wind goin in and out of a bee smoker . Then he 's just got one good leg and it 's not any bigger than a hoe handle . I do n't see how Parsie can stand him . Parsie 's a right good-lookin woman to have six brats . I could see last May Parsie was goin to have a baby . She went out and worked in the fields a little . That did n't matter .   She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as pretty a woman as there is in these parts of the country . Ai n't but three familieshere . Just two women . Parsie and me . Timothy Muscovite is too ugly to ever get a woman . He lives by hisself over there in the old Hinton house on the ridge . Ai n't nobody in this country knows where he come from . He 's got money . We do n't know where he got it . He 's too ugly to ever get a woman . He do n't look like a man . He looks like a brute that walks on its hind legs a-standin up . Great big devil . Big hands and feet and hairy as a dog with a face like a monkey . We heard there use to be a big gamblin man that strolled these parts when they built them tunnels on the E-K railroad . He won money from the workin men every pay day . He rode a big black horse . We heard Timothy Muscovite waylaid him on the other side of the Barney tunnel and knocked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The horse went to old Sweeter Hensley 's place . I 've heard Pap talk about it . I do n't like for Blue to run with him , but he does . They fox-hunt together . Parsie , Timothy and Peg-Leg calls Blue , " Duck-Foot " Blue . I never did like that name . There 's not anythin I can do about it unless it would be take a pair of scissors or a butcher knife and cut Blue 's toes apart . He 's web-footed like a duck . His toes , the two next to his big toe on his right foot , are growed together ; and the two next to his little toe on his left foot are growed together just about half way up . The two on his right foot are growed together plum out to the end . And people call Blue , " Duck-Foot " Blue Scout . They call me Mrs. Duck-Foot Blue Scout . Law , how I hate that name . If I 'd cut Blue 's toes apart now it would n't matter . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood pizen . A body just ca n't tell about them things . Better to leave them as God made them . God marked the Scout family for a sin a way back yonderin the Scout line . A old man by the name of Jim Frailey got two of his toes mashed flat in the log woods . Blue 's greatgrandmotherlaughed at his toes . That was right before Blue 's grandfather was born . When he was born , he come with two toes on each foot growed together . When he married and hadP234children the seventh child had toes growed together on both feet . That was Blue 's father . When Blue 's father married , his seventh child was Blue . He 's got toes just like his Pap and his Grandpap . It runs in the Scout family . I never was to say jealous of Parsie . I know she 's a betterlookinwoman than I am . I 'm not a good-lookin woman . I used to be when I was young . When I walked down the church aisle , men riz to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't anymore . Hoein corn and bearin babies for the man I love ' s took all that out of me long ago . So much housework to do . So many cows to milk and hogs to slop . So many chickens to feed . A big house to keep clean . It 's a pine-log house and for God 's sakes , women , do n't ever let your man make you a pine-log house or move you into one . They 're too bad for bedbugs . They 've nearly et us up since we 've been here . If I did n't scald twice a week all the beds , the slats and the cracks they 'd eat us up . Then I keep my bed casters a-settinin a tin can of coal oil . So it 's work around here besides havin a baby every couple of years . That takes some time out . Parsie 's had to work out . She do n't go ahead like I do . She ai n't worked like I have . I live right here across the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since she 's lived over there in old Bill 's house . She 's never done the work I have . That 's the reason she 's held her shape . If she 'd a worked like I have ! But she ai n't . I do n't see for my life how she lives with that thin-lipped ugly Peg-Leg man of hers . Pon my word , if I was choosin between the two men I 'd ruther have old MonkeyfacedTimothy Muscovite . He would provide for a woman and treat her halfway decent if he 'd a been good-lookin enough to a-got hisself a woman . He would n't a worked her like a horse nohow . I used to stand up there by the drawbars and watch Parsie goin out there to the sand bottom to hoe corn . She would be barefooted walkin along the path dodgin the saw briars . PegLegwould be in front with a mule hitched to a plow . He 'd let the mule drag the plow along and scive up the grass and the saw briars . He was too lazy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it drag . Parsie would walk behind with her hoe on her shoulder and her lap done up down to her petty-coat with pumpkin seed and bean seed that Parsie would stick in a hill of corn in the rich spots of ground around the old rotted stumps and rock piles . I used to just watch her pass . I would say to myself , " If my hair was just black and pretty as hers I would n't begrudge everything I got includin the old cow Gypsy . She 's got the prettiest blue eyes . Just like two blue bird eggs . She has got the whitest skin and the longest fingers . Her teeth ' s white as chalk . She 's pretty as a doll . " Then I would say to myself , " I am a liar . Parsie is not pretty . She is not pretty as I am . My hair is light . My eyes are blue . My teeth are fairly good . I am prettier than Parsie . I have four children . I do n't want to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't . I am just twenty-six years old . I do n't want a duck-footed youngin . I do n't want a marked baby just over Blue 's great-grandmother laughin at a man 's mashed toes . That 's too much punishment for God to put on any person . It 's not fair . I ca n't help what she done . Why should I suffer for her sin ? I am not a ugly woman . I am a prettier woman than Parsie . I am not a liar . " But I was a liar . Parsie is the prettiest woman I ever saw . I used to watch Blue when Parsie and Peg-Leg come over on Sundays to eat dinner with us . I used to watch Blue to see if I could catch him lookin like a man looks at a woman he likes . I never could see a thing myself . I would fry the meat on the stove . Parsie would be in the kitchen helpin me . We would talk and the meat would sizzle in the pan . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if Blue was lookin through the front-room door into the kitchen at Parsie . I never could catch him lookin at her . I would be nice to Parsie because she was so good-lookin . I was nice to her because I could n't be as good-lookin as she was . She did n't know she was good-lookin . And just think her married to that thin-lipped toothless , peg-legged , no-count , good-for-nothing man of hers . She ought to a married Timothy . Just us three families in our neighborhood . Two women and three men . And somethin ugly about all the men but mine and he had his toes growedp236together . I watched him around the other woman . We would cook dinner for the men layin in the front room on the floor smokin their pipes and talkin about the crops . I could see the smoke goin up toward the ceilin in little blue clouds . And under my breath I hoped and prayed to God old Peg-Leg would get his hair filled full of bedbugs from the pine-wood floor . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't deny it . I never liked that no-count man . I do n't see how any woman could . I am a woman . I know about a woman . She wants a man all the other women like . She wants to walk right in and take him by the arm and say , " Look , woman . I got him . He 's my man . " And after she gets him , if some woman does n't want him , then she wants to dump him and get her a man they all want . That 's the way it is here . I knowed sure as God made the grass that Parsie would like to have a man like Blue . That made me want Blue more than ever . I had him , but I wanted more of him since I felt like Parsie wanted him . I could n't help it . Well , we used to eat Sunday dinners together . We borrowed meal and sugar and coffee from one another . We was the best neighbors you ever saw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a man worth anythin he was worth watchin and worth havin . So many men these days are noaccount . Not worth powder and lead it takes to blow out their brains . I used to watch Parsie more than I do now . She is ready to bring a baby now . I 've been listenin for a call from Peg-Leg every night . I 've been listenin to hear him come out in the yard and stand under that bare walnut tree in their yard and say , " Oh , Amanda Scout , come over here quick to Parsie . " And I 've just been lookin to see all six of their children come stealin in over here carryin them infernal bedbugs on their clothes to stay all night any time . I just think every night I 'll see them comm . Fall-time here . Leaves dead on the ground and a body so sad this time of year . All this trouble and all this weary . It worries me just to think about it . Parsie is soon to have her baby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard in the fields and would come in dog-tired and do up the work  --  I 'd go to bed and I could n't go to sleep for thinkin somethin . I did n't think it . I felt it . A woman feels like a dog that raises its bristles when it smells where another dog has been . That 's just the way I felt . I just raised my bristles when I thought about Parsie . God knows I liked her in a way . God knows I hated her in a way . If it just had n't been for Blue . I felt like she felt the same way toward Blue that I felt . My bristles would raise . I could just feel a feelin comin in all over my body that Parsie liked Blue same as I did . I just could n't stand to think about it . God , I cried . God , I rolled and tumbledin the bed . I done everythin . I could n't forget . Last summer Peg-Leg , Blue and Timothy would take the hounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fox-huntin . Parsie would sleep in one bed with her little youngins and I would sleep in another with mine . I was filled with the very devil . I could see myself pullin out Parsie 's coalblackhair and throwin it to the ground in handfuls like sheep wool . I could feel my fingers goin into her eyes . Law , how I wanted to put my hands on her . But I was afraid . She 's a stout woman with her hands . I thought about gettin a scythe blade and whackin her across the face . Then I thought that was not the way to do it . I could get a sickle and sickle her neck like I would a bunch of plantin in the yard . But a better way still to do it was to get a garden hoe off the palings and just light in on her with a hoe and chop her good like choppin weeds . I can fight with a hoe better anyhow . But here was all them little babies around her asleep . Pon my word , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could just see my man Blue in her . I knowed it was Blue . I just felt it . God knows I did . God knows it 's the truth . A woman just feels , that 's all . She ca n't help it . Men never understand like a woman . Parsie would lay in the bed and snore . Her babies would cry and wake her . When she would rouse up I 'd snore just like I was dead asleep . But I could n't sleep in the room with her knowin she 's goin to have a baby . When she would go back to sleep I 'd set up in the bed and look out at the winder . I 'd see the summer moonlight in the green corn . I 'd hear the whippoorwills so lonesome  --  my God , how lonesome the nightP238would be . Then I 'd hear the hounds bringin the fox around the piney pint . I could hear old Skeeter , Blue 's blue-tick hound , leadin the pack . He 's got a bark like beatin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's leadin the pack and when he 's behindhe squeals like a pig . I 'd lay in the bed and listen and think . I could n't help it . Why was I like I was ? Maybe I just thought things . Then I 'd think that I was crazy and I 'd have to be sent to the asylum . I 'd seen one man go there . They used to put him in the corn crib and feed him bread and water every day . A County man come out and found him . They hauled him off handcuffed in a spring wagon . The last words he said to me : " Put my shoes down by the fireplace . I 'll not get any more shoes . " I did n't have his shoes . I 'd never seen his shoes . He was just ridin past in the wagon . What a terrible thing it is to be crazy . It 's not anything to laugh about . " Am I crazy as the man I saw in the wagon , barefooted with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head ? What a terrible thing . " Then I would think : " No , I am not crazy . I just feel like somethin is goin to happen that I do n't want to happen . The wind told me . God told me . I feel it . " When we 'd come in from work I 'd pitch and tear in the bed till twelve o'clock many a night . Blue would be beside me snorin . I 'd think to myself : " Wonder if Parsie loves him . Wonder if she has ever told him that she loved him and them lips that trembles in snores  --  wonder if words come from between them to Parsie : Yes , I love you too . ' That silent body of a man . It is like a , child . It cries to get things . It gets them , then it is through . It is quiet like a child . A woman is not like a man . A woman feels things . A woman understands . " The days passed by last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time and chopped the weeds out of it . We plowed it the second time and the third time . It was soon over the mule 's back . When it got that high we quit plowin it . I 'd lay in my bed at night and look at it . I 'd look at the moonlight on the cornfield bright as day . I would think : " The night is pretty . The night was made for man and the fox . The night was made for silence . The stars in the sky . The silver-like dew- drops on the corn . The night is pretty , whoever made it and whatever it was made for . I like the night . I love the night . " I watched the moonlight flicker on the corn blades as the night wind blowed them this way and that way . And I thought : " The night is so pretty . The God that made the night made me . I am not pretty . I am such a fool . If I was ugly as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are pretty . But I ca n't be quiet , as trustworthy as the earth . I am such a fool . Some women are such fools . I am one . But the reason I am a fool , I ca n't trust . If I could make myself believe that I trusted like a lot of women . But I ca n't . I just ca n't lie about it when I feel a thing . You can trust the earth , but not its seasons of drouth , rain , snow and sleet . You can trust a huntin dog , but not when she comes in her season . Women are a lot like a dog . They have their seasons . " I could smell the wet weeds that bordered the corn  --  the ragweeds and the pussley . The wind from them smelled awfully sour . God , I thought of women and their seasons . And as the moon rolled along in the flyin fleece clouds I thought about man and woman . If I could only have Blue just so I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money . If I only owned him like he was a quarter or a half of a dollar , I would n't mind . But no woman can own a man like that . No man can quite own a woman like she was a pound of salt or a dime 's worth of soda . There 's somethin else to a man or a woman besides that . And there 's nothin in the world  --  not even marriage vows , lovers ' vows , God , churches or anythinabove the sun or under the sun that would keep man and woman from lovin one another . ( Just to show you what I am talkin about , old Felix Harkreader fell in love with his sister . He may not a fell in love with her . He lived with her just the same . They had two children . Young Felix Harkreader lived with his sister and they had four children . That would make the children only havin one Grandpa and one Grandma . They had a little money and they kept it in the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the family . The old Grandpa kept a little notebook with the names of women in it he 'd met and lived with . If he found one and did n't like herP240he marked her name off the list . He carried one thousand dollars in a red handkerchief and five hundred dollars in a blue handkerchief . He used the white handkerchief for his nose . Two women heard about the thousand dollars he kept in a handkerchief . They thought it was the blue handkerchief . They had a date with him . One had him upstairs and stole the handkerchief . She thought she got a thousand . She got five hundred . He come home and laughed and said : " They thought they 's gettin my thousand , but they just got my five hundred . She 's not any good anyway . " So he marked both names from his notebook . You just ca n't trust people . You ca n't own them . I try to own Blue . I want him for my own . Just as I expected . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school  --  all but my little ones . Parsie sent her children to school all but her two little ones . The cold November wind was blowin across the cornfield where we worked last summer . It was a awful day . Wind blowed the rags out of the winders where the lights had been busted out by the hail last summer . I trembled when I saw Peg-Leg comin across the road runnin on that wooden leg . I knowed somethin must be wrong or he would n't a got such a move on him . Wooden leg was sinkin in the soft ground where it had got sharp on the end . He 'd pull it out and run and it would sink up again . He said , " Oh , Amanda  --  come quick  --  It is Parsie . She is sick  --  come quick ! " He took back toward the house . I let my work go and took out toward the house . I knowed what was up . I left my little children in the house . I was afraid they might get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at the barn . I told him to stay with my little youngins till I went over to PegLeg'sand Parsie 's a minute . Blue understood . He took to the house a-runnin and left the mules ' harness on the ground that he was punchin holes in to brad up a little . I was nearly out of breath when I got in the house . I put water in the teakettle and het it . God knows just how much there is to be done when a woman is havin a baby and they ai n't no doctor . But I 've delivered a many a baby . I knowed just what to do . I done it . It was a lot of pain for Parsie . No woman wants the pain of bringin a baby into the world . SheP241has to go through a lot for the sake of a child that just grows up and spits in his mother 's face and flies off like a wild quail . But they bring them just the same . Woman has her season . She was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her children and never happy unless she has them . But I 'm tellin you it 's a lot of trouble and a lot of pain . Woman pays for her pleasure . I never saw a woman suffer like Parsie . I done the best I could . I hated to see her suffer so . Cattle suffer the pain of birth and dogs and horses suffer . But not any livin bein suffers like a woman . Men do n't understand . Women soon forget and are ready to bring another baby into the world . They soon forget all about childbirth pain . I could n't think for hearin Parsie suffer . When the baby come a wee thing of cry and a bundle of nerves , I did n't want to see it . But I had to see it . The water was hot . I poured in some cold water and made it lukewarm . I washed the baby . I just could n't believe before I saw it that it would look like Peg-Leg Jake . I wanted to think that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see a little baby brought into the world and have to go through the world ugly as old Timothy  --  so ugly he looked like picturesof the Devil . I just did n't want to look at the baby at all . But I had to look at it . Before I washed it , I thought about Blue over at the house with my two little children . I thought that Blue was just a child . I was his mother and his wife . He was one of my children . The baby cried . Parsie went off into a doze . She closed her eyes . Her lips were blue . She was bad off . I could tell . She had been too long bringin the baby into the world . I had to wash the baby . I had to care for it . Peg-Leg ran out of the room . I looked at the baby 's ears to see if it had little lettuceleafears like Blue . I looked at its lips . I thought I could see cut in the upper lip beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it was on Blue 's lips . I could see Blue 's eyes in its head . Surely , I was dreamin , but I could see the image of Blue in the baby more than in any child I bore for him . It was a boy . It was Parsie 's seventh child . And I thought : " Could it be Blue 's baby ? It looks like him . No . It does not look like him . I amp242dreamin . This is a world full of trouble and dreams . It has some joys . Not many . I cried over this before . I felt it . Is it a lie ? Is it the truth ? It does n't matter . Parsie is dyin . She says : It ai n't my baby . I never saw it before . Take it away . I wo n't have it . Who give me that baby anyway  --  take it away or I 'll scream . Timothy brought it here . Timothy Muscovite , the ugly son of Satan . Take it away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose throwed in the fire . Her eyes set in her head . She had never remembered . I was sorry that I had hated her and wanted to hook her white neck with a sickle and glomb her eyes with my fingers and fight her with a hoe . I was sorry . But I have to wash the baby . It feels like it is mine . " And then its toes ! I thought . I 'll look at its toes . I looked  --  My God  --  Oh  --  God . The two little pink toes on the right foot next to the big toe was growed together plum to the end . The two toes next to the little toe on the left foot was growed togetherhalfway up to the end . It is Blue 's baby ! Oh my God ! It was Blue Scout 's baby . It is a Scout ! I tore my hair . I screamed . Parsie was quiet . She did n't hear me . She did n't bat a eye . I thought she was playin possum on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby down on the cloth . It moved its little pink hands and wiggled its little toes like toes and hands of young mice a body finds in the corn shocks in the spring . The baby cries like a little pup . I could n't help it . I ran out of the house . I wanted to kill Parsie . Blue could n't help it . It was not his fault . I ran to get the hoe off the palings . I saw Peg-Leg Jake talkin to Timothy Muscovite  --  two of the ugliest-lookin men I ever saw . I hated them both . Just to think of woman and her child . Think of the mother dog when pups are born how ill she is with the dogs . She makes up with them before her season starts again . God made them that way . God made us all that way . I can not understand . I took the hoe and run into the house . I thought I would kill Parsie . There she was in the bed . Her face was white as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gettin her breath right . I just could n't kill her . She was down . I could n't kill a person down not able to help herself . I do n't care what she 's done . Here was blood in the room . I thought of that sour smell of weeds last summer when the wind blowed in across the fields into the open winder where I was sleepin . That sour smell . I held to the hoe handle . 1 thought once I 'd chop her head off right where her neck was the least to chop through . That was Blue 's baby . Then I thought I would n't kill her , for she was goin to die anyway . Her down there sufferin so and me standin up with a hoe to kill her like I 'd kill a snake . That was not fair . I could n't do t hat . So I walked over and raised the winder . I pitched the hoe out the winder . The dead leaves blowed in when I raised the winder . November winds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash rag and I finished washin the baby . I hated t hem toes . Just to think ! The baby belonged to Blue . You are not foolin me . God do n't prank with people for the sins of t heir people . They carry the mark . Now if I lived to have my seventh child it would have duck-foot toes . It is a mark of Blue 's people . The children come in from school . Peg-Leg sent them all over to the house for Blue to keep . Blue never come about . He acted like a whipped dog . That is a man for you . He does n't pay for his pleasure like a woman . If he could have only seen Parsie suffer like I saw her . Now her eyes set . Surely she was dyin from childbirth . What a awful death . Only a woman can understand . Only a woman knows . I could n't kill her with a hoe or a sickle . Poor woman was dyin . I could hear breath come and go and sorty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the ceilin where the rain had leaked through . Her eyes were about half open . She said : " I know it ai n't mine . It ai n't mine . It is Amanda 's baby . It belongs to her . She will have it . I wo n't need it . " And when she said that , I said : " Sure , the little thing is mine . " I pulled it up and kissed it . The baby was Blue 's . The baby was mine . I 'd take it . It was Blue 's child . I love Blue . All that is him is me . We are together . We are one . His child was mine . I held the baby in my arms . I could n't love Parsie . I just felt for her . Her there on the couch a-dyin . The winds played around the house as night come on and the sun sunk down on the other side of the pasture . The bare limbs of the trees looked like they was growed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betwixt me and the moon . The baby cried . I nursed it with peppermint tea that Peg-Leg found by the old Daugherty gate . I told him right where to find it . Women have got it there before for their babies . All the men in the country has come there to get it for their wives . I never told Peg-Leg about the baby 's toes . I told him I wanted the baby if Parsie died . He told me I could have him . I told him I would raise him right and under the eyes of the Lord . Peg-Leg shed some tears . So did old Timothy . I felt sorry for him  --  him so ugly a-cryin when he walked up with Peg-Leg Jake and saw Parsie on the couch . I remember the moon that come up . It looked to me like it had a spot of blood on it . I saw blood maybe . It was on the bed . It was on the floor . It was on the moon . Blue was in the house with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her breath got shorter and shorter . It kindly sizzled and she crossed her hands on her breast and she went out of the world . I had the baby in my arms . I saw her go . I ca n't forget . I called Peg-Leg . He come runnin in . Timothy come in with him . I took the baby and walked out . I took it to the house . I started making clothes for it before its mother was laid out to bury . I was glad she died . I had to be glad . I did n't want to kill her with a hoe . The baby is mine . He is dear to me as my own . I call him Blue . He looks more like Blue than airy one of the children I have by him . They buried Parsie back by the edge of the sand cornfield where she used to hoe corn before the baby was born . She is buried under that hickory at the fence corner . Timothy Muscovitehas moved in the house with Peg-Leg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him any more . I ai n't said a word to Blue about the baby bein hisn . I think he understands . I take care of the baby . It belongs to me . Man does n't understand . It takes a woman to feel and understand . Man is fickle as the wind . The wind will blow the ragweed seeds over the earth . They will grow here and there . Man is not particular . He will leave his seed to grow here , or there , and in awfully poor soil , sometimes . P244THERE is a belief that gold and silver is buried in the Leadingham Branch  --  just white sheets of silver running through bright panels of gold . " Just like the streets of I leaven , " says Peter Leadingham , " and I will be the man to find all this money in an old clay bank . Clarence Webb told inc the needles wo n't work under any circumstance but one . He says when loadstone is hid under the ground it will draw the needle in another direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bury loadstone on the farms after I 've rushed over everybody 's farm but my own first . " ( Each man firmly believed the gold was hidden on his farm . It may have been . If it was it still remainshidden in an old pantry , under a floor , under some leaves , in a cave or an abandoned coal mine . ) A party of men held Red Jacket up and one said , " If you do n't tell us where the gold is you 'll die . " " Red Jacket lead you to no gold . Red Jacket keep gold to shoe Indian 's horse and buy firewater . Red Jacket do n't tell . Red Jacket know gold is here . Red Jacket do n't tell . " Red Jacket did n't tell . He was hit over the head with a mattock handle and left in Widow Skaggs ' hog lot , in the leaves of a tree top that had been cut when the tree was green . ' Ile killing took place in September . It was well known on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the hands of a fanatic group of money-crazed men . It was the talk that Peter Leadingham 's hogs in widow Skaggs ' hog lot , had rooted him from under the leaves and the crows got a little and Alf Sinnett 's fox hounds finished him . The hungry hounds packed away the bones . Jim Kearns found thigh bones and a man 's skull near the head of Leadingham Branch . Jim says : " It is a Indian 's bones . I can tell they are Indian bones by the thicknessof the skull . There was a caved-in place too , right across the top where he had been hit with the mattock handle . " Following the murder , revivals were started over Garter County . This was the first time the Free Willers and FortyGallonBaptis had gotten together in ten years . Free WillersP246did n't believe in drinking firewater and Forty-Gallon Baptis did . Before they had defied each other in the pulpit and doomed each other to roast in hell 's fire , red pepper and brimstone . They preached the same doctrine : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fire than Judas got . " Red Jacket is human and he has a soul if he was a Indian , " says Brother Peter , " but Red Jacket should have told where the gold was so it could do somebody some good . Poor little children in Garter County that had to spend ten hours hoein corn for twenty-five cents a day could a used some of that gold . Killin him did n't get the money . They did n't do it right . Why did n't they put a fire under him and make him say it ? " Each man accused his neighbor or his neighbor 's son of killing the Indian Chief , Red Jacket . No one knew exactly who did it . It was just talk . Who had seen this Red Jacket anyway ? A Medicine Man had been in Jimpson Burr for a week selling patent medicines and herb hair tonics that he guaranteed would grow hair on fish . The patent medicine was for the liver . It was told that one man died after taking one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat his liver to death . He pulled old men 's and women 's snaggle teeth with his bare fingers . He wore a braid of long black hair and feathers in his crown . Everybody flocked into Jimpson Burr to see him . Isser Pennington used his tonic trying to grow hair on his glassy head . The hair tonic showed he was n't a fish . It was guaranteed to grow hair on fish . Old Peter Leadingham , the first , was considered the Solomonof Leadingham Branch . The young ministers , Owl Webb , Rodner Perkins and London Elam , took the case to old Peter and asked him to pray over this wonder and give verdict on the following Monday morning . Old Peter was the only one that had received the Secon ' Blessing . He got Sanctification and it was impossible for him to sin . During the week days he cut timber for Ben Sexton . He made good money . He made sixty cents per thousand . That was fine . All the young men got fifty cents a thousand . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I go to God for all the bargains I get , " says Peter , " and I 'll go to God about Red Jacket too . I 'll find that money . I 'm the only man that has ever seen God , met Him out in the woods and talked to Him in person . I 'll meet God out again and find out where the gold is . That will save me from cuttin timber at sixty cents a thousand , even if I do make ten cents more on the thousand than the other boys . I 'll keep that under my hat . Buck Sexton told me to because the other men will get sore if they find out Buck is favorin Brother Peter Leadinghama little . " During this week-end in September , old Peter Leadingham goes out into a beech grove around the south pasture slope from his house . He gets away from Matilda , his wife . Matilda says : " Peter , where are you goin poddlin out across the yard under the white oak trees on this fine day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that peg . Do n't mash one with your foot . " " Matilda , you ai n't got no business askin me where I 'm goin and messin up a man that is goin to talk with God . Matilda , you are a old meddlesome . Why do n't you attend to your own affairs ; dig the taters , wean the two suckin calves ; save the milk ; cut pussley for the fattenin hogs and patch my pants . That 's a woman 's work . You certainly ai n't no business botherin a man that had been selected by my Brothers in the FortyGallonBaptis church to talk with the Lord . Why did they select me ? Because they know I 'm on the square with God or they would n't send me to pray the matter over . I 'll fool ' em when I meet God face to face and tell him everythin . God will tell me where old Red Jacket 's gold is . " Old Peter heard the winds of September rustle through the ( lying corn on the steep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like through the buff-colored corn . He runs his fingers through his beard and plays with them as a child would play with the silks of growing corn . He hears the leaves fall softly to the ground . He sees the wild ducks inP248the formation of letter L above his head . He hears their honkingcries that make him lonesome . " Lord , what a Sunday mornin this is to meet God and have a talk with Him , " says Peter . " I am free from the cross-cut saw , the ax and sledge hammer . I am free from Matilda too . She is always fussin at me . She 'll be sorry when I find all the hidden gold and every girl on Leadingham Branch will want to play with my beard and ride in the buggy beside me down to Jimpson Burr . She will be sorry then . " Here is a little stream of water emerging from the roots of a beech tree . Old Peter stops to drink . He falls flat on his belly . He puts down one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to hold his gray whiskers and keep them out of the water . He sups the cool clear autumn water into his wrinkled mouth and swallows with gurgles . He gets up , bones creaking , and smacks his lips and wipes the water from his wet beard with his rough scrawny hand . " Good water , " says Peter . He walks twenty yards and kneels to pray . He is alone under the copper autumn leaves and the rustling of a sheen of golden and scarlet beech leaves . He begins to pray the way he used to pray at the Leadingham Church House where so many feel under conviction and were saved . " I am God 's mighty trumpet , " he says . " God 's voice goes through me. " 0 God , if you love me as I love you , Almighty , listen to me , give me some of your time , please . Old Peter 's never done anythin to you . Here 's the whole thing . I 'm a poor old man . Eyes are gettin bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm hard-workin old man and I 'm a poor man myself . If you 'll just let me know somethin . Tell me where Old Red Jacket 's gold is . I 'd use it in convertin the Free Willers of Garter County . Them people do n't have the Sperets , Lord . 0 God that money ! Why not now ? Let ' em call us Forty-Gallon Baptis ! Let ' em call us that and they 'll get the brimstone , hell 's fire and damnation and punched with a three-pronged pitch-fork ! " Old Peter stays in the beech grove all day . He prays and claps his hands and preaches and looks up to his glass-domed P249heaven . Heaven is right above his head . Just a mile or two . It is right up in the air . He could see through it , but he could n't sec heaven until he died . The wind lifted his locks of hair and played with his gray beard . Old Peter is a strong mountaineer . He can eat one side of a hog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttermilk and eat a half pone of corn bread baked two inches deep in a ten-by-eighteen-inch pan . lie can saw the fiddle and whistle in the jug . He is six-four , has high cheek bones , large hands , protruding mouth , shaggy eyebrows , dull meaningless eyes , thick through the hips with a slightly bent frame . He has scarcely any teeth , a few tobacco teeth , that 's all , Doc Blevins could n't get with the horse forcepswhen he pulled his teeth that time . Night comes and Peter fasts like the men of old . He preaches and he prays . He hears the sound of the wind in the dying corn . He feels it in his long gray beard . It whistles through the lonesome autumn beech tops mournfully . The low moon comes up and goes down over the low dark hills dragging a cloud behind it . Midnight comes with a flight of stars and the sinking moon . Old Peter is growing tired . He is about to give up the ghost . I le is so tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop . Chains begin to rattle . Drunk men begin to call for more " Rock and Rye . " " My goodness , " says Peter , " I see the old Devil pass me like a fallin star . He must have been scared the way he runs . He goes right up the Leadingham Branch with a pitchfork in his hand . I see him . He has the horns of a twoyear-oldbull and he looks somethin like a black cow walkin on her hind feet . God will be on next . Here comes the two archangels flyin through the woods carryin torches . They 're lightin up the way . " Peter shudders. " 0 my God ! Here comes God ridin on a cloud . Two thieves crucified with him are ridin by His side with pointed spears in one hand and torches in the other . God is smoking a pipe like the one I used to smoke. " 0 Lord , " cries Peter , " what are you bringin them men with spears for  --  to spear me , Lord ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumble of thunder : " Be quiet , my good faithful servant , for I am your Master . " Peter is spellbound . He can not speak . He looks at God in the beech grove beneath the starlight . God and the stars and himselfall right out here together at night . " My Baptis Brothers wo n't believe me when I tell them the straight of things . Neither will Matilda , Old Matilda . I need a young woman . God is just a common man . Sure he is . Everybody has been goin on about his mighty size . He 's a little man with the power to remove mountains , stop rivers . God is just about the size of Judd Sluss . " Now God , you 've come , " says Old Peter . " Now let 's get down to brass tacks and fix up everythin . The first thing I want to know is where is old Red Jacket 's gold he told the white men around Jimpson Burr about ? " God says , " I 'll not tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will cause much confusion here on earth and much killin of men and women who have not been converted into your church but belong to that old boy I run up the holler with that pitchfork . Did you see him ? " " Yes I did , Lord . He was a big hunk of beef , too . I was skeered for he looked right at me . " " That 's all right , Peter . I ca n't tell you where the gold is . " " That 's all right , Lord . That 's perfectly all right . Do tell me this . Who killed the old Indian ? " " I thought I told you once that would cause a great rebellionin your church around Jimpson Burr . " " Beg your pardon , Lord , I 'm so deef I ca n't hear good . " " I thought I told you once who killed Red Jacket . " " No Lord , you said that you would n't tell me where thegold was . That 's what I ast you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says the Lord . " Well , is Red Jacket in heaven ? " " Yes , " says the Lord , " Red Jacket is with me . Even if the dogs and hogs did eat his meat he 'll arise from that tree top in Widow Skaggs ' hog lot on the mornin of the Resurrection when Gabriel blows that old fox horn of his . " " 0 God , " shouts Peter .   " Do n't 0 God me , " shouts the Lord , " I hear enough from you Forty-Gallon Baptis in Jimpson Burr . " The Lord pulls His tobacco pouch out of His vest and begins to reload His pipe with tobacco that smells to Peter like his home-grown taste-bud leaf . He fills the pipe and swats fire with His mighty hands . Old Peter shudders . He shrinks slowly to the ground . " Have some , " says the Lord . " Do n't smoke , " says Peter . " Now do n't tell that to me , " says the Lord . " Did n't I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know about all the things you have done . Did n't you kiss Ben Sexton 's wife ? I 'm not sayin what old Ben done to Matilda . " Peter ca n't speak . " Wonder what Ben has done to Matilda . She 's always been a nice woman the fifty-five years I 've lived with her . Could she be gettin spry and reckless in her old clays ? W'y hell 's fire ! What about God smokin like that ! My church do n't approve of it even if I have been slippin out and doin it . Matilda noses in and tells a few of the members about it . I fixed that up all right , for people knows she is nosey anyway . " " Listen here , Peter , before I go , " says the Lord , " I want to leave one thing with you . The Indian has a speret . Red Jacket is a knockin speret . When men are not doin right he 'll knock on their hatbands , pant legs , shoes , bedclothes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even knocked on red flannel drawers and night shirts . His knocks will be heard too . When you want to talk to him just do somethin out of the way . If you happen to be the seventh child of the seventh generation you can raise this speret and talk to him . Otherwise , when he knocks , somethin is wrong with your heart . Now go back to Jimpson Burr on Leadingham Branch and preach the Gospel . " Under the white cloud goes the Lord . There is a lot of poppingand cracking of sticks . " Can I believe that was God ? " says Peter . " Sure it was God . You 're damn right . Who else could it have been ? He smoked a pipe though ! That is sure God Hisself and He is just as common as the men who bring butter and eggs to Jimpson Burr on Saturday mornin . " P252It is past midnight . Hungry Peter Leadingham goes down the creek under the beech trees for home . The children have searched the woods for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to go crazy . " She 'd been praying because she ai n't kept his clothes patched . The whole countrysidehad heard her screams and went to hunt Grandpa , but no one thought to go right up the holler from the house . They 've been over to " Pint " Bishop 's saloon and down to old Widow Skaggs and over to the meeting house . " Just think , " says Matilda , " he has been my husband fifty-five years and we have quarreled all of that time but the first six weeks . He has been a true husband . He was fifteen when I married him . " They have quarreled , it is true . But they love each other . Neither one had kissed another boy or girl , for it had not been the Lord 's will . Peter kissed old Ben 's wife , Hanner , out behind the smoke house one night . But that did n't count . Matildaslipped a few nice kisses to Ben Sexton . Peter did n't know it . It is better to kiss a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's better to kiss a man with pretty teeth than one that has n't any . Old Peter walks down the path and into his log house . " It is great to be back , " he says . He pulls the latch string at the front door and slips in . He goes to his bed . He pulls off his pants and shoes and crawls in bed beside Matilda . He touches her with his cold feet , roots her out of her warm place , rolls over in it . He falls into a dead sleep . Monday morning and the sun begins to peep over the scarletautumn leaves . Ben Sexton , Toe-Head Gillum , Young Peter Leadingham , Big Eiff Leadingham and Owl Webb walk silently down the cow path that leads to old Peter Leadingham 's log shack . The sun yellows the hollyhocks that grow where Matildathrows the dish water from the kitchen window . The sunflowers wave a nod in the tall ragweeds in the garden and sorty droop their heavy heads as if they were young girls ashamed of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rusty stove pipe setting like a lazy boy on the lean-to kitchen . It has an odor mixed of burnt rabbit and brown gravy stuck to the skillet.  | " Lawzy , I can taste that steak Matilda is fryin , " says Ben Sexton . " You said a mouthful , Ben , " says Owl Webb , " I 'll bet she tastes right where you hold her . " " Matilda is a damn good cook , " says Big Eiff . " Sure thing , " says Toe-Head . " Looks like it 's goin to be a purty day , Toe-Head , " says Big Eiff grinning toward the sun . " Yep , right purty . " " Say , wonder if old Peter talked to God last night ! " says lien Sexton as he takes a whiff from his red corncob pipe made from one of the old soggy cobs picked up at Widow Skaggs ' hog pen . " Yep , I spect he did , " says Toe-Head , " you know he 's good at them there tricks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and Matilda will hear you , " whispered Owl Webb . " Old Matilda is one hell of a meddler they say , boys , " says Big Eiff as he takes his forefinger and clears away the perspiration from his bald forehead and throws it off his finger into a wet dotted circle on the dry sand of the cow path . The five men are going through the goose lot to the kitchen  --  Old Peter is lying on the chicken-feather bed . He is asleep . I lis two hound dogs are snoring by the hickory-wood fire with their noses in the ashes . Peter 's long squirrel rifle is hanging on pegs on the low sagging loft . His snuffbox is on the dresser . It belonged to his mother . He has kept it for a keepsake . A pot of green fall beans are sizzling over the hickorywoodfire . Matilda has gone and picked them very early this morning before she did the feeding and milking . She came into the house this morning with sticky-bean leaves , redbrown , golden and drab all over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sold eggs for the dress at twelve cents a dozen to the Webb store . Ben Sexton got her the shawl twenty-five years ago for a Christmas present . She 's not worn it much , but kept it in the trunk until the moths started eating it . Five men go dragging in at the low front door . Owl WebbP254is too tall for the door . His forehead strikes the door-facing . " Damn it , my head , " he says . " Good mornin , Matilda , " says Ben . " Good mornin , Bucky Boy , " says Matilda . The other men shriek four different-toned laughs . " Where 's that husband of yours ? " says Ben . " He ai n't got up yet , Bucky . You men make yerselfs right at home . Have some chears . " She slaps Ben on the back and they all laugh . Matilda hands Buck out a chair with wire woven in the hickory-bark to make the seat stout enough to keep Peter from breaking through . Ben sits down and jumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . What 's that ? My God ! " He has a steel trap hanging to the seat of his pants . " My God  --  O Lord , " he yells . " What the --  " " Never mind , Buck , it 's a trap , I set it there for the cat . Peter found her in the churn once and it 's sorty turned his stummick on buttermilk . I thought I 'd catch her at her old trick . " " But Matilda , you got the wrong cat , " says Peter looking all the time at the hollow poplar log with a board nailed on for a bottom , used for a churn . Matilda slips up and mashes the spring down with her strong hands and frees Buck from the jaws of the trap . He sighs with relief . But then , Lead and Raggs spring from their sleep by the wood fire just in time ! Raggs grabs Owl Webb before he sits down. " 0 Lordy  --  my Lord ! Help , Buck ! Toe-Head , take ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Do n't stand there . My God ! Take ' em off ! 0 Lord ! " Owl is fighting Lead to keep him off his face and Raggs has him with a full mouth in the seat of the pants . Old Ben is smiling after the steel trap has caught him in the same place . " Here Lead , here Raggs , " shouted Old Peter who has been awakened by the screams , " what do dogs mean grabbin a man in broad daylight . " " Mean , hell ! " shouted Ben . " Pretty damn nice way to live right with dogs in the house and cats in the churn . " " Oh , do n't mention that cat , oh do n't . " Peter holds his head over the bedside and gags . " Listen here , Buck , " says Peter ,   " you 've had your way long enough . Now God and me are goin to have our way a little while . Get me . I saw God last night and talked to Him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has seen his Saviour face to face and talked to Him . I never went blind either when I looked on His face . " " You do n't mean you saw God , " says young Peter . " What did He tell you ? What did He say about me ? " " Never mind what He said about you . It was bad enough . One thing He said : if you did n't let other men 's wives alone you would go straight to hell and there was n't goin to be any sanctification for you either . " " What did God tell you shore enough , Uncle Peter ? " asks Toe-Head . " Well boys , here 's my story . God is a man the shape of Judd Sluss . He 's mighty friendly . If you went to His place and He had only beans for dinner He 'd ask for you to set down and have beans with Him . Oh , God is jist like one of us fellars . He has quare ways . That 's all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke . " " You do n't mean that God smokes , " says Owl . " Yes I mean God smokes , " says Old Peter , " and God smokes a pipe just like I do and the same brand of tobacco . Now let me tell you about God . He means business . I saw the old Devil too . God drove him in front up the holler like He drove the swine out'en that old bad woman back yander . He just looked like an old cow walkin on her hind feet . He carried a redhandledpitchfork too . " " How you tell atter night ? " Owl inquired . " Now you jist keep quiet until I 'm through here and then there 'll be plenty of time left fer you to bark , Mister Webb , " says Old Peter running his hands through his beard . " Now consurn his hide ! Then I looked and here come God with the two thieves that were crucified with him . " " What did he tell you , Pap ? " says young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jist gettin to that . Bear a little with me here . God said Red Jacket was killed all right . He would n't tell who done it . He said Red Jacket was in heaven . You see , men , I always told you the Indians has sperets , didn'tP256I ? Well , I was right . Now Red Jacket is a speret  --  a great knockin speret . " " A great knockin speret ! " Big Eiff repeats again . " A big knockin speret . " " Now it 's like this , boys , " says Peter , " because Red Jacket was killed God gives him the power to knock on hatbands , shoes , nightshirts , doors , windows or planks or just anythin around or about them fellows that plotted to get his gold for their children . A dirty shame that anybody would do a poor Medicine Man like that . " " How do you know when to get him to knock , Pap ? " says young Peter . " Well God told me the seventh child of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock two times on the door for me , ' and the speret would knock . Sometimes it will have to be petted a little before it will work . All the sinnersin the community will be pestered with it . " " There ai n't no such thing as a knockin speret , " cries Ben . " I do n't know about that for somethin knocked ten times straight on the toe of my shoe this mornin when I started to put it on . " " Toe-Head , we 'll just give that thing a test . We 'll go down to Lonnie Johnson 's . His daughter Belle is the seventh child of the seventh generation , for she has been blowin her breath in young babies ' mouths to cure the thrash . ' Now let 's let her know and we 'll all gather in . The people in Jimpson Burr will come . " " That 's a go , " shouts Ben Sexton , " but we must just let certain people know about it for we do n't want a whole yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. Hankas in on this . He 'll claim that he talked to God and found this out . You know him . " " Yes , I know him , " says Toe-Head . " It 's purt nigh time we 're a-goin , " says Owl Webb . Old Ben gets up , rubs his hand over where the steel trap had caught him and leads the way out . " Do n't be in a hurry , boys . Stay and we 'll have some dinner atter while . Then we 'll open up a keg o ' nails . "  | The boys all laugh and Old Ben says , " No thank you , we 'll be gettin over the hill to our beans . " The three men plod slowly up the cow path the way they came . It is sheathed in a brilliant autumn sunlight . Persimmon leaves are strewn across the cow path . The cow pasture looks lazy in the sunlight as a lizard sleeping on a log in July . The five men enter the cornfield and cross the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hand . He says , " Damn it , Owl , keep off my heels . " They looked back to see a little stream of smoke swirl from the cabin chimney on old Peter Leadingham 's shack . The wind rustles through the corn and carries the dry thin persimmon leaves and the beech leaves into little rifts like wild birds flyingin autumn . The heat looks intense on the dry September pasture fields . The dying corn and the wind harmonize on a lonesome song without words . Soon the men are out of sight . After they 've gone Old Peter says , " Matilda , carry the rockinchair out in the front yard for me and wash my feet while I think the situation over . " " Belle is practicin with the sperets , " says Matilda . " Windy Meadows told me and Lefty Hern told Windy . He said Belle was raisin ' em right along , but it caused her neck veins to swell an awful lot . She takes fits too , after that Red Jacket works on her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hankas , " says Peter . " He used to preach with me until he tried to steal the jewelry we got from some railroad men we saved at Peach Grove . We got three watches from three men and he tried to take the third watch . " Men cut down their green tobacco crops when they got saved under Brother Melvin P. Hankas . They set fire to their barns of cured tobacco . " Burn the damn dirty stuff because no one is seen in heaven with a chew of tobaccer or a pipe , " says Brother Melvin P. Hankas . Peter always keeps a " Scandal Board " that he hangs on theP258wall in his church . On this he puts the men 's tobacco that they throw down when they are under conviction . He puts the old-time rats the women wear in their hair on this scandal board ; and the jewelry , tobacco , pistols , knives , rats , blackjacksand ten dollar bills . He takes with him a tent during the summer . They have a net of ropes for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brother Melvin P. Hankas . " He 'll be right in to get his part of the Red Jacket money with me . That old man just wo n't be uptripped . He 'll be right there . I ca n't do nothin for Brother Melvin P. " Matilda has pretty well got her Old Peter 's feet washed exceptthere are little streaks of dirt between the toes that is hard to get off . It is dried and has to be soaked a little . Peter is askingMatilda to get the side-saddle on the mule and go around to invite his friends to the Johnsons ' house for Wednesday evening . Belle Johnson is ready to perform . Matilda gets the saddle on old Murt . She takes orders from Old Peter to invite Young Peter Leadingham , Windy Meadows , Dad Dysard , Owl Webb , Big Eiff Leadingham , Rick Johnson , Sister Fultz , Lu Nelson , " Pint " Bishop and Widow Skaggs . He warns her not to bother about going out of the way to invite Ben Sexton . He warned her to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocky Leadingham Branch . Lead and Raggs follow her and smell of the fence posts along the road with their tails curled over their backs . They look like men wanting trouble . Peter is alone at home barefooted under the apple tree . He is thinking over the situation and watching the young chickens play hide-and-seek in the tall ragweeds catching June beetles . Up on the left fork of Leadingham Branch , Judd Sluss is laughing about Old Peter talking to God . His wife is knitting the holes in her new homespun blankets and cussing Judd for burning up the candles she used when company came . Now she will have to use pine torches . The thought in Peter 's brain , " left hand knoweth not what the right hand doeth . " Wednesday night . The little line of dusky lanterns can be seen swinging through the dark up the plum tree bank to the Johnsons ' house . They are to be there at eight o'clock tonight . All that are invited come and two who are not invited heard about it and come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads the way into the Johnson home . " Hello everybody , " shouts Peter . " Hello , Brother Peter . " " Yes hello , Brother Peter , " and out from behind the door steps Brother Melvin P. and pats him on the back . " I thought 1 'd give you a little surprise by gettin behind the door . " " Well you did surprise me shore enough . I did n't know you was goin to be here until I heard that old voice of yours . " " Well , I 'm right here , Brother Peter . " " Yes , I know you are here , " says Peter . Peter walks away . There is much handshaking among the members of the reunion . Matilda and Buck are still shaking hands over on one side of the room after everybody has finished . Peter noticed them through the corner of his dull meaningless eye , remembering what God had told him . " Well we 'd better get ready fer action here , boys , or we wo n't git around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the announcement and tell them all what this is about . " " All right , Brother Lonnie . " Peter walks out in the middle of the floor . " All right , now brothers and sisters , listen to the sound of my voice . Tonight is going to be a big night with us . I saw the Lord last Sunday night and talked with Him and I 'm not ashamed to tell it ; I smoked with Him . " " Smoked with Him ! " " Now be quiet while I talk . Yes I smoked with Him . We got the straight about Brother Red Jacket . He is going to be in your souls tonight . God gives him that power . You know that poor old Indian that was murdered in Widow Skaggs ' hog lot --  " " In my hog lot  --  my God , I did n't do it . " Widow Skaggs says this and is trying to faint -- P26o " Now , be quiet , bear with me , people . God is going to show you what He can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belle Johnson steps out with two fox horns . They are shaking every way in her hands . She has a terrible time of holding them . " Now men and women , " says Belle , " you will have to pay Ada Bee Sizemore fifty cents apiece before you talk to Red Jacket . " People hold their breath . " Who is this Ada Bee Sizemore anyway ? " says Young Peter . " She is a new one they are springin on us . " Here she comes out of a little room . She carries a little Testament in one hand and a torch in the other . She wears a white flowing robe and she has sandals on her feet . " Lord , but she looks like a angel , " say Old Peter Leadingham . " Ada Bee Sizemore is my name , " says the strange woman . " I am here to help Little Belle Johnson . She is a youngin at this work . I am ready to take your money and let the knockin speret talk with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And they will talk to you . " " Who 's ready now ? " says Belle . " I 'll try ' em a whack , " says Dad Dysard . " I 'll give one day 's work just to learn ' em . " Ada Bee goes over and gets the fifty cents and his arm . She leads him in a little room and pulls out a deck of cards . All the time she keeps running her fingers through the cards and keeps asking Dad questions . " Dad , " says Ada Bee , " you go out and sit down in that willowrockin chair in the front room . I have to handle the good Speret and I must be away . I have to be in a trance and never move a muscle . " " All right , " says Dad Dysard . He goes to the willow chair and sits down . Ada Bee goes in behind some starched white curtains . Belle walks in and puts the quivering fox horns on the table before Dad . They still quiver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is scared . Belle tells him to sit still and get the light on the other world . The women see Dad in such misery theyP261shed tears . The men all hold their heads but Old Ben . He laughs . " Not a damn thing to it , " he laughs louder and louder and shows his yellow teeth . A little white thing slim as a poker , and white as snow on a granite roof , comes up by the side of Dad 's chair . " Hello , Dad , " said the voice . " Hello , Vilet , " says Dad . " It 's my wife . " Tears stream from his eyes . " You been dead for thirty years . " " Yes I was once your wife , but you are married again now . " " Yes , married , " and that is all Dad can say . He just sits silently and stares at the figure . " Though you are married I love you just the same and I am with you a lot . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you died ? " " Thirty-nine . " " Right . How many children did we have ? " " Six . " " How many girls and how many boys ? " " Three boys and three girls . " " How many are livin and how many are dead ? " " Five livin and one dead . " " Where is the one dead ? " " She is with me . She has grown until you would n't know her . " Dad melts down . He picks up courage to speak again although his voice is shaky as a reed in the wind . " Are all my children at home ? " " No , young Hankas is in Missouri . I am with him a lot too . " " Well , what kind of a woman did I get for my second wife ? " " No good .

If you do n't change your way you 'll never be where I am . " Dad grabs his hat and takes out the front door . He comes back . He is afraid in the dark . The men and women see how he is crying . No one else will try it . Peter and Brother Melvin P. punch each other and Melvin P. says , " We 'd better not try it on account of them watches . " Ben Sexton has become a little suspicious on account of the women . Matilda is right here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my first wife. , About me not goin to heaven is what hurt me most . I 'll not be a Free Willer any longer . I was saved under Moses Stricklin . It ai n't the right kind of religion .

" " Yes , Brother Dysard , we 'll give you real religion , " says Brother Melvin P. " You ai n't half as bad as I wuz . No church but the FortyGallonBaptis could save me . I was so mean when I wuz a young man . I even drove a nail in a horse 's foot to make him lame so I could buy him cheap as dirt . I bought him and then I pulled the nail out and he got all right .

Right there me and my Lord got right and He put his hand on my head and said , Preach . ' I went to preachin in three days from that time . Dad , you can get right . " Dad Dysard , Brother Melvin P. Hankas and Brother Peter Leadingham are out in the night . The night is black as your pocket behind the house . They are praying loud as the wind is crying through the plum trees . In the house it is quite different . Belle Johnson is in the kitchen . All the people are gathered around her but Ada Bee Sizemore . She has the table standing on one leg , two legs , three legs and dancing all around the room . The crowd watches . Julia Shelton is a little girl with ribbons on her long braid of coarse black hair . She is a friend of Belle Johnson 's that is the reason she was invited . Yesterday she went to the pasture with Belle to help her find some pawpaws . Belle took a fit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameto and asked for water and says : " Good Speret , go away . Stay a away . I 'll leave you alone . " Belle lets anybody examine her hands . She will let anybody sit on her lap but Ben Sexton to see if she is moving the tablein any way . They do it . No one can tell it if she is . " I can hold that table down , " says Owl Webb . " Get on , " says Belle . Owl jumps on the table and says , " Let ' er go . " The table begins to shift from one side of the room and do all kinds of capers . " God , what is all this about ? " screams Owl . " Ride her , cowboy , " shouts Ben . " You ride ' er , " shouts Owl half stunned as he hits flat of his belly on the rough puncheon floor . " Well I can ride ' er , do n't you weary , " says Ben . " And my belly wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em on that air table , Belle , " says Toe-Head . " Yes let old Ben on , " says Big Eiff standing over in the cornerwiping sweat from his bald head . " Get on , Ben , " says Belle . " No , Ben ai n't goin to get on that table , " says Matilda . " What have you got to do with it ? I 'll get on if I want to , " says Ben . " No petticoat ca n't keep me from doin nothin . " Matilda shrugs her shoulders and gives two steps backward . Old Ben is rolling back the sleeves of his new store-bought shirt . It shows the muscles in his arms . He unbuttons his shirt at the neck and shows his hairy chest . He looks mean.  |p264His  hair is black and coarse as ragweeds and falls across his eyes . " Show me somethin I ca n't do , " he yells as he leaps on the quivering table . " Hell , I am a man . I 'm not a soft boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his big rough hands . He sticks his teeth in the rim of the last end board . On the other end of the table he fastens the toes of his ten-and-one-half ' shoes under the end board . " Let ' er go , Belle , " shouts Buck , " I 'm rarin to ride ' er . " " Belle , be careful , " says Matilda . Belle gives the table all of Red Jacket 's powers . It quivers and shakes and stands on one leg . Ben holds on . It stands straight in the air with Ben 's head downward . Ben holds on . It stands on one end awhile to try to make Ben dizzy , so Owl Webb said . " By hell , ai n't I holdin on , Owl ? " Ben looks up with a mean grin on his face . At this minute Ben has to drop . " I told you you 'd come off there , Ben Sexton , " laughs Owl . " Off hell , " shouts Ben . He jumps up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll eat this thing before any Red Jacket can handle me . " Ben is looking more serious than ever . He clenches the top again with his teeth . Over flops the table pinning Ben to the floor. " 0 Lord , " he moans. " 0 Lord . Take the table off , take it off . " Everybody is afraid to touch it . " Take it off , Red Jacket , " says Belle Johnson . Off comes the table . It set in its upright position . Ben is stunned .
