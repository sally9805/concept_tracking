txt Notice that the United States is as ready to give up gold as to receive it , under the new and modified gold standard adopted last Jan. 31 , was conveyed to the foreign exchange markets of the world yesterday when $1,000,000 gold was scheduled for shipment to France by the Guaranty Trust Company as a pure arbitrage transaction in foreign exchange . The gold , which was taken from the vaults of tile Federal Reserve Bank under Treasury license yesterday afternoon , will be shipped on the liner Manhattan today . The shipment is the first " exchange " export of gold under the new gold standard and the first such gold transaction to be arranged in this country since April , 1933 . License for the export was granted immediately by Treasury officials , who , it is understood , have been eager to see an export made to set at rest the skepticism displayed in European financial circles over the re-established gold standard here . Another Shipment Likely . It was reported that another shipment might be made today , although the dollar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ export , rallied well above the price at which gold exports can profitably be made . There was , in fact , some question in Wall Street as to whether the rally in the dollar had not made the gold shipment superfluous . It was pointed out that the Guaranty Trust Company , in selling short francs preparatory to making the shipment , must have disposed of the French exchange at 6.70 cents or better . With the franc down to 6.68 cents yesterday , it appeared to some observers that the franc sales might have been covered with an immediate profit to the bank , obviating the trouble and risks of actual exports . This circumstance , combined with the fact that the Guaranty is known to act frequently on behalf of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve in carrying out transactions in foreign exchange and gold , led to the surmise in Wall Street circles that the shipment might have been strongly encouraged by the Treasury as a means of demonstrating the orthodoxy of our gold standard . It was at least certain that the export would not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In addition to arranging for the export of gold , the Guaranty followed the example of several other banks in turning back toward Europe a shipment of gold which had arrived here consigned to it . The shipment , which amounted to $577 , - 1900 , ca , a in on the Scythia and will be sent back to London on the same boat without being unloaded . A consignment of $150,000 gold for the Chase National Bank on the Majestic is also being sent back to be sold in London , where the price of gold , measured in dollars , has increased sharply in the past week . due to the decline of the dollar in terms of sterling . Dealings in foreign exchange were again quiet yesterday , compared with the excitement of last Saturday , and the dollar gained on all sides . Sterling fell to 85.09% , down 14 cents ; the franc went to 6.68 cents and closed at 6.68% cents , off % point . In terms of the franc the dollar rose as high as 99.30 per cent of parity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other gold standard exchanges cheapened rapidly against the dollar . Guilders fell 6 points to 68.73 cents , Swiss francs declined 6 points to 33.08 cents and beiges were down 5 points to 23.80 cents . The Canadian , : ollar was down 13-32 cent to a premium of 217-32 rcents . Marks dropped 15 points to 39.70 cents , lire 1% points to 8.70% cents and Japanese yen 6 points to 30.25 cents . Scandinavian exchanges were 5 to 6 points cheaper . Although the franc is still within easy striking distance ' f the gold export point and further gold shipments are possible , the opinion prevailed in foreign exchange circles that the acute stage of the recent raid upon the dollar had gassed . It was believed likely that the demonstration of , our readiness to export gold when the value of the dollar in exchange justified it would give pause to the more enthusiastic bears in Continental European exchange circles . Gold exports , by automatically checking the decline of the currency at the level at which gold shipments become profitable , put a very definite limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The daily gold report of the Federal Reserve Bank failed to list the gold withdrawal made by the Guaranty , presumably because it had been made up before the gold was taken out , although the announcement of the shipment was made fairly early in the day . The statement showed neither exports nor imports , but reported a gain of $70,700 through the net decrease of that amount in gold held under earmark for foreign account .
