When the S.S Rex steamed into New York harbor one evening last week reporters clambered aboard to interview a celebrated passenger . They found a nervous little man who wore spats , a bright checkered scarf and a fur-lined overcoat which , for no apparent reason , he kept putting on &; taking off . Once he had located the spectacles perched on the top of his head , he gladly gave his autograph . He used Russian letters but he set them down vertically , like Chinese . Deciphered , they read : ' " Igor Stravinsky . " <P> For the first time in ten years the most enigmatic of modern composers had dared the sea , which he hates , to travel to the U. S. , where he knows that even people who fail to understand his music will pay to see him . In Manhattan he was given his first reception by the League of Composers , long hospitable to all his efforts . Before he returns to Europe in April Stravinsky will have conducted big orchestras in Milwaukee , Chicago , St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear him as a pianist when he plays transcriptions of his works with Violinist Samuel Dushkin. * <P> By way of the piano Stravinsky became a composer more important , his champions insist , than Richard Strauss or Jean Sibelius , the other great S 's of 20th Century music .

In Paris the first-night audience shouted and hissed so loudly that the dancers were unable to hear the music . The white-faced Nijinsky beat time from the wings . A Londoner was so outraged that he wrote a letter to the Times calling Le Sacre " a threat against the foundations of our tonal institutions . . . standing for all the unnameable horrors of revolution , murder and rapine . ...
