families into freight ears and had shipped them off to these mines to begin life over . This group was assigned one mine to work , thus making it easier for the police to keep track of them and avoiding any conflict between these people and free miners . I saw quite a lot of them from the beginning . They all were completely bewildered by what had happened to them . Very few ventured to make complaints of any kind . It was easy to understand why they were bewildered : They had lost their homes , been forcibly removed from lands occupied by their families For generations , and put . to unfamiliar work in unfamiliar surroundings . They lived very much the same as other miners . Standards of life , from the American viewpoint , were low . They occupied houses vacated by the former workmen , I hough some eventually put up better houses , of their own . The working hours and rates of pay in this mine were the same as in the other . mines , with the exception that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund to . look after old and disabled persons in their , own group . They were free to move around , D TIRING the ten years I worked for the Soviet Russian Gold Trust , I kept on good terms with the authorities by showing no curiosity about matters which did not concern me . I never went out of my way to gather information about concentration camps , the exile system and forced labor , although I spent most of my time in regions to which political and other offenders were sent . But forced labor and exile play such an important part in the Soviet system that anyone who works in Russia as long as I did learns a lot about them . I had my first direct contact with forced labor in 1031 , after the Communists had begun to " liquidate " the small independent farmers as well as the small city traders . I was working , at the time , as chief engineer of a group of copper mines and smelters in the Northern Ural Mountains . One day a group of 6000 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under police guard . They were kulaks , or little independent farmers who had opposed the government 's scheme to combine their holdings in collective farms . The Communist authorities had rounded them up , confiscated their houses and furniture , put them and their within the district , an area several miles in extent , so long as they reported once a week to the chief police officer . Very few made any effort to escape ; their experiences seemed to have broken any spirit of defiance they may have had . Once in a while , two or three of them walked off and did n't return . I never learned what happened to these . The authorities , from the beginning , tried to encourage them to submit promptly to circumstances ; those who buckled down to work were soon given their lost citizenship rights and other little privileges . Later I encountered similar examples of forced labor in gold , copper and zinc mines in which I worked in several parts of the country . When forced laborers were brought into a mine , production ordinarily fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed up again . The kulaks had been the most intelligent and ambitious small farmers , and , once they had mastered their new work in the mines , proved superior , as a rule , to ordinary miners with years of experience . I do n't know how many of these kulaks were put at forced labor , but they worked all over the place , not only in the mines but in factories and forests , and building dams , railways , canals and powerhouses . They are still at work on such projects today . In the winter of 1936 , when my wife and I were making an automobile trip in the Far East , our car ran into a ditch soon after crossing the Trans-Siberian Railway at a point where prison labor was laying a new track . A Prison Without Walls W E NEEDED help to get our car back on the road and walked over to ask some of the prisoners if they would assist us . There was no guard in sight there ; the prisoners could get away if they wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first group we approached agreed to come along with us , and soon they had our car out of the ditch . They wore ordinary working clothes , perhaps a little more ragged than the average worker , and had no distinguishing mark we could observe . Most of them were not what we would call " criminal typos . " As a matter of fact , most of the forced laborers in Soviet Russia . would not be considered criminals under our system . Dispossessed farmers and traders and other people who opposed Communist policies are lumped together with murderers and thieves in work camps . I shall not try to guess how many forced laborers are at work in Russia . Others estimate the total at anywhere from one to five millions . The supply is kept up by each additional purge . The wave of arrests during the past year has undoubtedly added to the labor army . The Communists , being reformers , claim that their system of forced labor is very useful in curing criminals and breaking up old habits of thought and action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After some years of work in mines , factories or forests , the Communists claim that these prisoners become enthusiastic members of Socialist society . It 's difficult to prove or disprove any such claim . Political prisoners , including members of other revolatiouary groups and disgraced Communists , are seldom , if ever , put in such prison camps or groups . If they are considered dangerous , they are confined in concentration camps or isolated prisons . If they are considered merely a nuisance , they are given what is called " free exile . " All Russians are remarkably wary in discussing concentration camps and prisons . The Communist , authorities have succeeded in surrounding this subject with such an atmosphere of mystery and fear that it is rarely mentioned . I met a few Russians who seemed disposed to talk about prisons , but one never knows whether or not such people arc police agents , and I gave them no encouragement , since it was none of my affair . I have seen some of the more remote prisons at a distance . But I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as I know , no other foreigner has been conducted through one of them . I am not referring here to the prisons shown to tourists . I have an idea that the authorities deliberately maintain mystery about these places ; they become more fearsome if nothing is known about them . I can testify , however , that Russians are terrified at the prospect of being sent to such places . Though a good deal has been said about the " liquidation " of the kulaks , I find that very little is known in this country about the process the Russians describe as " denomadization . " In less ideological language , this means the complete destruction of the old social and economic organization of Russia 's Asiatic nomad tribes and their conversion , often by force , into settled farmers under state control , or wage earners in state-owned factories and mines . I witnessed this devastating process . I saw the nomads , in blind fury and despair , slaughter their great herds wholesale rather than permit confiscation for communal cattle farms . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as miners . The nomads were living pretty much as they had been for centuries when I first reached Russia early in 1928 . On the steppes they held fast to tribal life , following the grass with their camels , sheep and milk mares , living in tents called yurts . They kept to themselves and had little to do with the Russian town dwellers , whom they viewed with suspicion and hatred . I returned to the United States in 1928-29 to put our young daughters in school and to engage ten more American engineers for the Gold Trust . While I was away , the Communists went hog-wild . They started full steam ahead on " the march toward Communism " that has kept the country in an uproar over since . They began to pour more capital into industry and mechanized agriculture , and to liquidate all mimes that did uot cume up to socialistic par . The Nomad Liquidation P RICES of everything immediately went out of sight , because the little private traders and farmers who came to market were outlawed . Butter went from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now somewhere between sixteen and twenty-two , depending on locale . Potatoes which had been selling for fifteen rubles a wagonload now sold for twenty rubles a small bucket . The great peasant bazaars were deserted . Stores were emptied of their supplies . Perhaps worst of all was the liquidation of the nomads . These herders were in a position to supply the country with all the meat it needed , But no , that was n't Socialism , that was n't civilization . I know the Communists had , and still have , a lot of theories which make them act the way they do . But I do n't pretend to understand them . For that matter , I do n't even understand why we Americans bury in Kentucky the gold which I worked so hard to extract from the ground of Russia . During the years after the beginning of " the march toward Communism , " I watched the nomad herds evaporate while the Russian people went without meat and animal products . After the desperate nomads had killed their herds to prevent collectivization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herds could be destroyed more easily than replaced . There are fewer domestic animals in the pasture lands of Russia today than there were in 1929 , in spite of the government 's frantic efforts to build up new herds by high-pressure animal husbandry in recent years . I had my first experience with the rovers of the steppes as miners in 1932 , when I acted as chief engineer of a large lead-zinc mine in Kazakstan . Thousands of Kazaks ( Continued on Page 51 ) were brought to the mines to work because they had killed their herds and had no other means of subsistence . We had to make miners out of them and keep up production schedules at the same time . I never hope to have a worse chore than that . Those fellows had never seen a piece of machinery in their lives . Out on the steppes , where there is no timber , they had used buffalo chips as fuel ; they could n't even swing an ax . Very few could understand it word of Russian . You can imagine giving them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milling equipment and , especially , dynamite . I still do n't know how they managed to avoid blowing up themselves and all the rest of us . I well remember the day I went into a bathhouse and found a group of the nomad miners calmly using cakes of cyanide for soap . The Kazaks , though  --  or some of them  --  were able to adapt themselves to industrial life . When I returned to those mines in the summer of 1937 , a number of them were listed as Stakhanovists , or shock workers . They actually were doing a cornpetent job of mining . Naturally , the Russians encountered endless difficulties in trying to force the nomads into a new way of life . The tribesmen were intensely suspicious of all Russians , partly because the zealous reformers were overdetermined in imposing on them what they considered best , for the rovers . Even though they bring improvements , reformers are scarcely ever popular . I ' recall seeing one hospital overflowing with several hundred men and women nomads who had come down with scurvy because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had had meat and milk  --  fermented mares ' milk . In the mines , they got black bread and vegetables . They ate the bread to keep alive , even though they did n't like it , but they would have no part of the vegetables , chiefly because the Russians oversold a vegetable diet to them . In this community the roofs of houses were covered with onions drying in the sun , but the ailing Kazaks would n't touch a one . The Russians working on these primitive tribesmen today have had to learn patience and forbearance . The Communists possess what somebody has described as " inverted snobbishness . " They are prone to think that since the Russians of the past exploited the tribesmen , these tribesmen now must submit to any indignity . But the Communists have learned that they ca n't hope to get by with indignities , if they hope to win over the tribesmen to their way of doing things . Now they are granting the herdless nomads one special privilege after another . The ex-herdsmen from the steppes , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . on to the idea that the Russians can have no comeback if the privileges are abused . Today , if a nomad offends a Russian , the Russian has to grin and bear it , because the Communist courts always give the tribesmen the benefit of every doubt . Just as little is known here in this country about denomadization , so , too . I find that the free-exile system is rarely understood . It is uniquely Russian . It is practiced today in very much the same forms as before the revolution . I encountered free exiles almost everywhere I worked in Siberia , Kazakstan and the far east . They can hardly be distinguished from other residents ; they move about as they please , and usually have regular work . These people have been given a " minus , " to use the Russian description . Say , for example , that some petty political offender is given a " minus six . " This is a. very common penalty ; the political police seem to give it out to anyone even faintly suspected of disloyalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " minus six " can not live in or visit . the six principal cities of European Russia for a number of years . A Kind Word for Siberia I met some fairly distinguished exiles working in remote mining towns in Asiatic Russia . Usually they were doing routine work , such as bookkeeping . It is not easy for them to get responsible work , and most of them would not take it even if it . were offered them , since they would be held to account . if anything went wrong . Those I knew had a melancholy air , being separated usually from the people and kind of life they had known before . But in general I believe the horrors of the exile system have been exaggerated . I have read several books written about and by exiles before and since the revolution , and the amazing thing to me was the considerable degree of freedom allotted to the exiles . This is confirmed by my own experiences . I particularly resent the bad name Siberia has got as a result of this exile system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if I had to live in that country , I would choose Siberia as a place of residence in preference to any other part .. Living conditions in Siberia can be made as easy and pleasant as in our own North Central States or in Canada . However , when one reads books written by exiles it becomes apparent that exile is a terrible ordeal to the persons concerned . Why is this ? It seems to me that exiles who have gotten into print are mostly city people , who would n't like pioneer country under any circumstances . They are unhappy because they are compelled to live in virgin country , and away from the friends and associations of their city life . A confirmed New Yorker , for example , might be unhappy if he were compelled to live in the Pacific Northwest , although I consider the Pacific Northwest the best part of our country . I read Leon Trotsky 's story of his own life , and his sob stories about the hardships of his life in exile left me cold . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slicker who did n't like the country , and was trying to make his readers sorry for him on that account . At the same time , he was unhappy because he could n't get back to the politics he loved . As for real hardships in Siberia , Trotsky does n't know what they are . My wife and I will gladly match our experiences in Siberia against his and leave it to any impartial judge whether we did n't suffer tea times the hardships he did . For Trotsky , being a mere exile , did n't have to travel ; he could settle down in one place and write about the horrors of exile . But I had to travel constantly in my work in Soviet Hatssia , and the Soviet authorities have made travel just about as unpleasant as possible when one gets off the tourist lanes . From the day I arrived in Moscow in 1928 and could n't find a taxicab , until the day I left last summer , I had one continuous struggle to wheedle transportation out of the Russians , who make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unimportant citizens . I was never able to understand the sense of bringing a foreign engineer to Russia , paying him a large salary in foreign currency , and then having him waste days and weeks on end because he could n't get hold of railway tickets . My wife and I had some almost incredible experiences . On one occasion , we waited for five days in the city of Sverdlovsk , trying to get a railway ticket to Moscow . On each of the five days , we had to go to the railway station about four o'clock in the morning , shortly before the express was due , piling all our baggage into a Russian one-horse carriage and plodding through the snow about four miles to the station . The railway officials positively refused to telt us or anyone else whether tickets were available until ten minutes before the train arrived ; they also had no information about whether or not the train was late until it reached the next . division point . These trains were almost invariably late , so that it was no uncommon thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station before one could even learn whether or not it would be possible to get tickets . Travel Made Difficult On this occasion , we were refused tickets on four nights running , after waiting in the station for hours each night . Then we piled our baggage into a carriage and went back to the hotel , which was overcrowded as usual and could not give as a room , and we faced the prospect of waiting another twenty-four hours and making what might be another fruitless visit to the station . During the five days we never got a room at all ; we slept sitting up in straight chairs in the lobby . Another time , my wife and I arrived at a very small railway station in the far east , in bitterly cold weather , knowing that the place possessed no hotels or accommodation of any hind for the night . The station agent told us with the utmost positiveness that there were absolutely no tickets for that day 's train . The train finally pulled in , and I went aboard and discovered from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conductors told me I would have to go back to the ticket office and get my tickets before I would be allowed aboard . I hurried back to the ticket office and argued with the agent for some time before I could induce him to sell me tickets . When I got back to the platform , I discovered , to my chagrin , that the train had meanwhile pulled out , leaving me and my wife to spend thirty hours in that little station , sleeping any way we could on the floor . These journeys of ours , now that we can look back on them dispassionately , take on a quality of epic horror . I believe that we must award the palm to a trip we took together in 1935 . My wife had accompanied me on a tour of inspection of gold mines in Western Siberia , and we traveled. about 100 miles from the mines in an open automobile truck over rough roads through 52 sleet and rain . We arrived in the evening at a little way station , wet to the skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallway of the police office , with no opportunity to change our wet clothes . The next morning , when the train came through , it was again a case of absolutely no tickets . But we finally wheedled our way into what the Russians at that time called a Alasem Gorky ear  --  that is to say , n freight car hooked on to a combined passenger and freight train , and used for human freight . We traveled in this car , with its congested humanity , and still in our wet clothes , from eight o'clock in the morning until ten o'clock at night . We then reached the junction with the main Trans-Siberian Railway , and were told that we would have to wait until ten o'clock the following morning for a train to Novosibirsk . The only accommodation we could get for the night was a bench on the platform of the railway station , exposed to the weather and still in our wet clothes . To add to our discomfort , it turned bitterly cold during the night . The platform was crowded with men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kulaks , very rigged specimens . Suddenly there was a great commotion ; we roused ourselves and saw that the police were busily engaged in clearing the platform , shooing all the people out of sight of the tracks into an open space back of the station . The eastbound express with tourists on board was due , and it was considered advisable to get the wretched kulaks out of sight . My wife and I by this time were so disheveled ourselves that the police tried to herd us along with the kulaks , not suspecting that we were foreigners . But I flared up and they let us stay on our bench when they discovered we were not Russians . Novosibirsk Nightmare With the Mr ) of the police , we got a place on the train to Novosibirsk , arriving there at ten o'clock at night . We got hold of a carriage to take us and our baggage to the town 's main hotel , which we reached in a pretty fatigued state , as can be imagined . The clerk received us coldly , and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited the public bathhouse and obtained a certificate of disinfection , since that was the regulation . We asked where the bathhouse was located , and were told that it did not open until eight o'clock the next morning . I began to get mad . " If we ca n't get into the bathhouse tonight , and you wo n't give us a room until we get into the bathhouse , what do you think we can do in the meantime ? " I asked the clerk . He shrugged his shoulders . " It 's the regulations , citizen , " he replied . I left my exhausted wife sitting in the hotel lobby and went out in search of the police station . I explained to the police who I was and asked help . They called up the hotel and assured me I would he given a room at once . I went back considerably cheered up , and registered myself , adding that my wife would come along soon to register . The clerk protested : " But your wife ca n't have a room : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no special room for women here . " THE SHTURDRY I was too tired and disgusted to go back to the friendly poliee officers for further help , and we finally got permission to sit up in the lobby in our wet clothes for the third straight night . At eight o'clock the next morning , having snatched some sleep in spite of discomforts , we checked our baggage and went over to the bathhouse . We were agreeably surprised ; the bathhouse was clean and orderly . We took good baths and had our clothing disinfected in the steam room . Then we went back to the hotel , triumphantly presented our certificates and registered . The clerk selected a key and showed us to a room . When we unlocked the door and stepped in , we drew back into the hallway by a common impulse . It was the filthiest room I saw during all my ten years in Russia . Here we were , clean and disinfected after sitting up three nights straight , and no one had bothered to clean and disinfect the hotel room for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since 1935 , the Russian railways have got considerable favorable publicity abroad on account of improvements made by the so-called trouble shooter , Lev ICagatiovielt who was Commissar of Railways for two years . There have been improvements as far as freight is concerned : carloadings have gone up . And there seems to be some improvement in passenger traffic along the routes which are traveled by tourists . I have heard well-dressed Americans , after a few days in Russia , comparing the railways favorably with our own . But I am sorry to report that I could n't see much improvement in the regions where I did most of my traveling , in the gold-producing country . The railways , and steamship lines as well , have not organized traffic with any regard for the convenience of travelers . It must be home in mind that I , as a foreigner , would be more likely to get help from the police and railway officials than a Russian in the same position . And I was always traveling on business for the government , which was considered importaut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported , it can be imagined what the ordinary Russian traveler puts up with . I have known of several eases in which fairly important people have had to wait as long as twenty-one days in some railway station in order to get tickets for a necessary journey . It is obvious what effect such conditions must have on the state 's business . I looked hopefully for changes when I made long trips in 1937 , but I did n't see many . Tickets always were sold out , and it was impossible to get advance information about whether tickets were available . The same is true of traffic on such rivers as the Irtish and Yenisei , where large fleets of steamers are maintained . It seems to be due to nothing but bad organization . Red Red Tape The Communist authorities are always denouncing bureaucracy , but their system seems to make bureaucracy inevitable . We had a good example of the bureaucratic mind at work when we took a flying inspection trip through the gold fields of Yakutia , in the Soviet northeast , in 1936 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest in an automobile . The ' fold Trust has opened up this country , and has an elaborate network of conveniences comparable to those once maintained by the Hudson 's Bay Company in Canada . The Gold Trust has built motor highways rind light-gauge railways , and established a dmin of very good restaurants and hotels along the highways , which are supposed to operate for twenty-four hours in the day . We came to one of these restaurants late at night , and I or.lered some tea and light food for my wife and myself , asking the waitress to hurry , because we must push ahead without . delay . She shook her head . " You ca n't have any food , or even a glass of tea , for at least two hours , " she told us . " Our regulations allow a two-hour period for washing the floors , arid the time set for washing has just arrived . " I hunted out the manager and explained that I must have something to eat immediately , since I could n't wait for two hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations must be observed . I pulled out my documents , which showed that I was one of the officials in the same trust which employed him and owned this restaurant . He was not impressed ; ho insisted that regulations are regulations . Then I finally blow up and told him that he and his kind were the curse of Russia , and my anger prevailed where eommon sense had had no effect . He agreed at last to give us whatever we wanted . But by that time I was too angry to eat , and we pushed on hungry into the night . It 's easy to dismiss such bureaucratic attitudes as " Russian , " bu tannin slavish and asinine devotion to regulations scorns to be a common feature in government offices of all countries . The word " exile , " and all its implications , arouses a sense of horror in the minds of Americans which , I am convinced , is seldom felt so keenly by January sly . ? eue Soviet citizens . The latter are so accustomed to being knocked about by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regimes , that they accept as a matter of course treatment at which Americans would revolt . A friend of mine had an experience with a Russian family which throws light on this state of mind . The family had a daughter about nineteen years old who sometimes spoke out rather critically about the government . An old lady , who posed as a friend of the family , one day heard her talking , and reported her to the police . The police visited the family 's apartment in the middle of the night , as they usually do in such cases , and took of the girl and a diary she had kept from the age of fifteen . The girl was kept for two months in the Moscow prison for political suspects , during which time her family was not permitted to communicate with her . At the end of that period , the mother was called in and told she could talk with her daughter for twenty minutes . The girl told her the police had decided she had " counterrevolutionary moods , " and that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My friend , talking to the mother , asked : " And what do you think of such treatment ? " The mother replied earnestly : " Oh , we are very much pleased because our daughter received only two years of free exile ; she might have been sent to a concentration camp . " As a matter of fact , there is not a great deal of difference , so Far as I could observe , between the treatment accorded to those in free exile and those who are presumably entirely free . From the American viewpoint , all Soviet citizens are treated very much like prisoners on parole , especially since the old Czarist passport system was revived in 1932 . Every citizen must have a passport and register it with the police at regular intervals ; he must show his documents whenever he turns around . He has to get special permission to travel from one part of the country to another , and must reg ister with the police wherever he goes . Ile must . have a very special standing with the authorities to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got . such permission every year . Living by Passport An American friend told me about a conversation with one of his Russian employees . He happened to mention that he had never taken out an American passport until he was twenty-five years old and wanted to make a trip abroad . The Russian looked amazed . " Do you mean to say you never had to take out a passport until you wanted to go abroad ? " he asked . The American nodded . The Russian seemed puzzled . " I ca n't understand , " he said . " If you did n't have a passport , how did the police keep track of you ? " The Soviet citizen sentenced to free exile knows that he can not visit or live in certain cities . This may be a very severe hardship . Husbands and wives , parents and children , are often separated for years as a result of this system . But the same is true , to a lesser degree , under the working of the passport system , which enables the authorities to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have known them to refuse close relatives ( Continued from Page 52 ) 1 permission to join families already living in more desirable cities . The Soviet police , called by various names since the revolution , have a hold upon the population which no American can easily imagine . Sometimes it seems that the police really run the country ; one comes across them everywhere , and finds them active in unexpected places . They build canals and dams and power plants , construct new railways and highways , and operate number of factories and timber trusts . The police also have a hand in every Soviet enterprise . The various Soviet commissariats and trusts are all organized on the same principle ; the Gold Trust , for which I worked , is , I herefore , like every other trust . I have been in actual charge , for considerable periods , of several groups of mines under this trust , and even of the main office , as deputy chief engineer in charge of production . Naturally , I had to become thoroughly familiar with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years with the Gold Trust , I never learned the precise functions of two of its departments . The first of these is called the Political Assistant 's Department , and apparently serves as the connecting link between the Communist Party and the enterprise , whether it be a commissariat , a trust , a depart-went of the trust or a separate mine . There is always such a department in every Soviet trust , or enterprise under the trust , and the politicians in Moscow maintain intimate touch with the ; smallest as well as the largest enter . prises through these departments . The Secret Department There is a second mysterious department in every Soviet enterprise which is frankly called the Secret Department . I had no more specific knowledge of the functions of this department than of the Political Department . But I believe it is safe to assume that . this department is the connecting link between the federal police and the enterprise . I know as a fact that this department checked up constantly on our personnel , looked merchants , kulaks , and so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , " in the Soviet phrase , as well as guarding and checking shipments of gold bullion . From personal experiences there is no doubt that this department was necessary , as some of these people were engaged in small-scale sabotage . Though often in charge of production , I had no direct contacts with either of these departments , because / was not a Communist . The fact that I was a foreigner probably did n't matter . A Russian chief engineer , if he were not a Communist , would not have any more contacts than I with the politicians or the federal police . suppose it is safe to say that the Secret Department organized the elaborate system of espionage which is set up in every Soviet enterprise . It is always assumed that a certain number of workers in every enterprise are police agents , although it is seldom clear just who these agents are . The authorities also constantly endeavor to persuade amateur agents to report suspicious actions , and the newspapers laud any citizen who turns in any wrongdoer . There is so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens will seldom speak their real minds to one another , for fear the others are police agents . All reports of agents , whether professional or amateur , are apparently cleared through the Secret Department . The atmosphere of mutual distrust sometimes grew less tense during my decade in Russia , and sometimes became very heavily charged indeed . There was enormous police activity after the assassination , in 1934 , of Sergei Kirov , a Communist leader considered one of Stalin 's closest aides . The police became less active again in 1935 , and the atmosphere in the mines seemed more tranquil than at any time since the great " march towards Communism " started in 1929 . Then , with the discovery of the " wrecking " conspiracy among higher Communists in 1936 , and of the direct connection of this conspiracy with the Kirov case and other planned assassinations , and the removal of the police chief , Heinrich Yagoda , the activity of the federal police became more frenzied than at any other time in my experience . It was at its height when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events in Ramie since that time through reading for , eign and Soviet newspapers . Apparently the police have become even more active , and the scale of arrests and exiles and executions has accelerated . The new commissar of police , Nikolai Yezhov , a tiny little fellow with a very mild manner , has apparently cleaned out the disloyal elements of the federal police , and they are more firmly esta.bliehed than ever before as a central factor in the Soviet system . The Power of the Police I should say that the federal police have become , even more than before , a sort of power unto themselves , responsible only to the highest officials of the Communist Party . They were independent enough before . They even have their own courier system . More than once I managed to get a compartment on a crowded express train through the federal police , who had reserved a compartment for their couriers and did not need it . The police do not entrust . their correspondence to the Soviet post or telegraph , but send it in sealed bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than ever before about the need for " vigilance " against " enemies of the people . " Apparently , the authorities are convinced that the powers of the police should be strengthened rather than diminished . Looking at the matter from the viewpoint of a producer , an engineer , I have grave doubts about the degree of industrial efficiency which will be possible under virtual police control . Asystemwhich requires so many men to watch every producer does not appeal to an engineer 's mind . But the Communist politician , and not the engineer , controls the system in Soviet Russia . Judging by the way matters have gone during recent months , the Communists ' supervision will be tightened for some time to come , and the engineers will have less say than ever .
