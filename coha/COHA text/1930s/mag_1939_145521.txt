Dr. Hjalmar Schacht was president of the Reichsbank before Paul von Hindenburg was President of Germany . He was Adolf Hitler 's Economics Minister from 1934 to 1937 . As his country turned away from orthodox finance , substituting an economy of warfare for an economy of welfare , Dr. Schacht turned away from orthodox banking practice . He invented and juggled dozens of kinds of export marks to buy Germany what she needed abroad-largely for rearmament . <P> But while Dr. Schacht was not an orthodox banker any longer , he was still a banker . And while he juggled marks abroad , he tried to keep the lid on at home . <P> With German money markets flooded with Government bonds to pay for rearmament and public works , Germany 's private industry has been starved for capital . Railroads , big and little industries are badly in need of repair and replacement . One way to get money to pump into private industry is for the Government to borrow it from the people . But last week a Government loan was undersubscribed by from 300,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another way to get money is to tax it out of the people . But Germany is one of the most taxed nations . <P> The last way to get money is to make more of it . Dr. Schacht who had pulled Germany out of the horrors of the 1923 inflation , put his foot down on printing more money . That , in the last analysis , was believed to be the reason that last week he got his walking papers . Hjalmar Schacht , onetime orthodox banker , will be replaced by Walther Funk , onetime newspaperman . <P> Never one to mince words , Dr. Schacht was often frank to the point of incaution . Regarded as one of the financial geniuses of his time , he once was reported to have told Fuhrer Hitler and an assembly of Nazi potentates : " You need me . And you 'll continue to need me for several years . After that , you can shoot me if you want to . But you ca n't shoot me yet . " Asked once what he thought his future would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallows . " And last week Fuhrer " Hitler , in telling him that hereafter he would be able to use him for the " solution of new tasks , " wrote : " Your name will be connected forever with the first epoch of national rearmament . " <P> Dr. Schacht will remain a Reichsminister without portfolio , but few believed that he would continue to be a power . At the time of his dismissal he was negotiating with George Rublee , director of the Inter-Governmental Committee for Refugees , on a plan whereby Germany would increase its export trade by letting the Jews emigrate . These negotiations were curtly stopped , later resumed by Dr. Helmuth Wohlthat . <P> The Reichsbank , since 1924 a semi-independent institution not under the Government 's domination , will now be under the direction of the Reich Economics Ministry . In his letter to Dr. Funk outlining his tasks , Herr Hitler directed that Dr. Funk now convert the Reichsbank into a " German bank of issue unconditionally subjected to the sovereignty of the State , in conformity with National Socialist principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
