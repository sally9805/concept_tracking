" Palooka ! " " Spaghetti bender ! " " Wop Barber ! " Bowling cries like these have resounded since March 9 in the Fair Grounds Auditorium in Columbus , Ohio . There after a month of bowling by more than 8,000 expert bowlers , each with his own $17 composition rubber ball , the annual A. B. C. ( American Bowling Congress ) Tournament ended last week . Titles : <P> Doubles ( $500 ) - Gil Zunker &; Frank Benkovic ( Milwaukee ) . <P> Singles ( $300 ) - Earl Hewitt ( Erie , Pa . ) . <P> All-events ( $130 ) - Zunker , with 228.8 average for nine games . <P> Five-Man Teams ( $1,000 ) - Flaig 's Opticians ( Covington , Ky . ) . <P> The A. B. C. tournament , No. 1 event of the year for U. S. bowlers , is held every year in a city selected by the Congress , which pays **25;7108;TOOLONG Co. $10,000 for building 30 new alleys which are later sold for what they will bring . To the tournament at Columbus went 1,597 teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening with five-man competition , playing off singles and doubles from 9 to 6 the next day . Only one alley employe or exhibitionist ( professional ) was allowed on any team ; each ball was carefully weighed before its owner used it , to make sure that it did not vary from the standard weight of 16 lb . <P> The bowling balls , many of them engraved with their owners ' names in small colored letters , had either two or three finger holes ; bowlers carried them home at night in little canvas or leather cases , tailored to the proper shape . Wise contestants wore specially constructed bowling shoes with soft-leather uppers and elkskin soles . This year 's tournament was smaller than the one a year ago at Buffalo , no less handsomely conducted . Reams of red , blue and gold banners made the Fair Grounds Auditorium satisfactorily impressive . <P> After registering its scores , any team could go home . Most preferred to stay . Before the month was over there had been recorded the third perfect game ( 300 points for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of A. B. C. tournaments . Jack Karstens , a private in the U. S. infantry stationed at Fort Sheridan , Ill. , bowled his perfect game playing with J. Bruno in the doubles . Their total score of 1,193 left them far down the list . <P> The rule against professionals helps to equalize scores in the A. B. C. tournaments . Competition is so close that no bowler had ever had his name put up among the title holders twice until Frank Matthew Benkovic , who won the doubles last year with Charles Daw , won again last week . Actually , Zunker &; Benkovic won the title a fortnight ago ; the crowded gallery that watched them rolling up the record total of 1.415 knew that no two-man team was likely to approach it in the remaining days of the tournament . Shouts of " Attaboy ! " made a deafening uproar as Bowler Zunker moved to another set of alleys , proceeded to roll 712 in three games for his singles score and a record high of 2,060 pins in the all-events ( total score made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Said Bowler Zunker after making his record : " Just a strike streak ; one of those crazy things we all hope for . "
