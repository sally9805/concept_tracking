txt Unless the Supreme Court should come along tomorrow with an adverse decision on the Tennessee Valley Au. thority Act and further solidify the executive and legislative branches for a test with the judicial , the coming week promises a virtual showdown between President Roosevelt and Congress as to who is master in the immediate fiscal planning for the government . Administration leaders plan to appeal to the President to clarify his purpose as to taxes this session , if for nothing else to implement them in meeting the inflation tide which is already welling up in both the House and Senate . They not only propose to seek information but to appeal for inaction as well , ' as far as new taxes this session are concerned . They proposed tonight to ask specifically whether the President intended to seek new taxes to amortize the veterans ' bonus payment , for which the Budget Bureau estimates that . $2,249,000,000 should be appropriated for the next fiscal year . While the inflation drive is centered now against the suggestion of new taxes to meet this outlay , leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known its intentions may result in. the inflationists turning their attention to the farm program as well which in itself will require more than $500,000,000 annually in " new " or " substitute " levies . Inflation Drive Is Ready . The inflation offensive has already been organized and is " set to go " at the appointed signal , which is the first official intimation of the President that taxes will be sought for the bonus . It is being marshaled by the same leaders who pushed the Patman " greenback " Bonus Bill to passage last year , but finally met defeat in a Presidential veto . In ultimate effect , the inflation movement is not expected to go far this session . Nevertheless , it could cause trouble to the administration 's legislative plans , and this is why Congressional leaders were determined to appeal to Mr. Roosevelt to make known his intention . They want to know for what and with what they are to fight the inflationists . They would much prefer to have this information before presenting the new farm program , whose huge outlay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excises , the agricultural processing taxes invalidated by the Supreme Court 's AAA decision . Thus far the inflationist leaders have shied from the suggestion of some of their associates for including the requirement for farm-aid funds in the drive for currency expansion . They have intimated a willingness to do this , however , if the administration shows any misgivings as to the constitutionality of re-enacted levies , or if there remains any question as to the ability of these taxes to raise the necessary funds . Neutrality Bill Is Waiting . All other legislative matters have been subordinated as a result of the repeated indications last week that the administration would soon present a demand for new taxes . The effort for new neutrality legislation has suffered , not only because of this new overpowering domestic issue , but also from troubles of its own . So great were possibilities for new delays seen today , that some observers thought that the bill submitted early in the session might be abandoned finally in favor of a simple continuing resolution for the present temporary law , which expires Feb. 29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to proceed with the bill , but leaders in that body are unwilling to press for action in the face of new difficulties in the Senate . Senator Johnson and other members of the Foreign Relations Committee have been going through the provisions of the administration measure with a fine-tooth comb , thereby retarding the progress and indicating a more determined resistance when the measure reaches the floor . The most immediate measure on the administration 's legislative agenda is the farm program , and efforts to press it forward in the Senate this week are expected . Leaders have little heart for the task , however , because of their lack of information on where the money to finance it is coming from . The House is expected to proceed with routine matters this week , including two regular appropriation bills and the unanimous consent calendar . The Senate will likely follow its usual course and meet only two or three days . Even if the President should send up a tax message . neither body would be likely to get down to work on it , except through committees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
