( See front cover ) <P> Late one afternoon last week Chicago 's Mayor Edward Joseph Kelly started to leave his spacious fifth-floor office at City for home when a newshawk from William Randolph Hearst 's Herald &; Examiner stepped up to him . " You want to see me ? " asked Mayor Kelly . " Yes , " replied the Hearstling . " Questions ? " " Yes " Mayor Kelly turned on his heel , strode back into his office , shot over his shoulder : " There 's no use your waiting around . " The reporter departed . Next morning the Herex blazoned this headline across its front page : <P> MAYOR KELLY IN BIG U.S. INCOME TAX SCANDAL ! <P> 50 PCT . FRAUD PENALTY PAID TO GOVERNMENT ; <P> AMOUNT OF ' SETTLEMENT ' MORE THAN $105,000 <P> Thus did Publisher Hearst 's sudden crusade to oust the Mayor of the No. 2 U.S. city finally come crashing out into the open . For a week the front pages of the Herex and the afternoon American had been smeared with thundering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in an income tax jam with the Federal Government . The constant use of Mayor Kelly 's picture left readers in small doubt as to who was meant . All the Mayor would say when questioned was : " Any answer I might make would put me on the spot . I have paid my income tax every year and have nothing to fear on that score . " But when the Herex finally broadcast the fact that Ed Kelly had failed to report income of $450,000 in 1926-28 and had settled with the U.S. Treasury in May 1932 for $70,000 in taxes and $35,000 in penalties , it was bigger news for Chicago than the Century of Progress .
