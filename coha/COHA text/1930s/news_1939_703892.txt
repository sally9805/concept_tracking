txt The proposed Battery-to-Brooklyn bridge was attacked as hastily conceived , likely to ' blight real estate values at the Manhattan end , undesirable for passenger vehicles , detrimental to harbor traffic and ruinous to the skyline , in a joint statement issued yesterday by the Merchants Association , the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects , Real Estate Board of New York , Regional Plan Association and the West Side Chamber of Commerce . Robert Moses , returning early from Florida to defend his project , characterized the criticisms as " the same old tripe " and said he would " take care of it all tomorrow " before the City Council Committee on State Legislation . The committee will hold a hearing today at 11 o'clock in City Hall on Mayor La Guardia 's request that the Council approve bills pending in Albany that would authorize construction of the bridge by the Triborough Bridge Authority , of which Mr. Moses is chairman . Moses Discusses Objections Commenting on the charge in the joint statement that the bridge was unnecessary for commercial traffic from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those were matters for the agencies that would finance the project to worry about . He said both the RFC and a syndicate of forty banking houses were keenly interested . " The argument is absolutely false , " Mr. Moses declared . " If it were true then the bridge could not be financed . " He said he did not expect any difficulty about getting the approval of Secretary Ickes as head of the PWA or Jesse H. Jones , head of the RFC , who as holders of the bonds of the Queens-Midtown Vehicular Tunnel , now under construction , must consent to the bridge instead of a tunnel which the New York City Tunnel Authority is authorized by the State Legislature to build . Mr. Moses said the RFC had been interested in the development of the bridge project since last Summer . The bridge was proposed last Jan- nary by Mr. Moses as a feasible , self-liquidating project costing about $41,000,000 in place of a BatteryBrooklyn tunnel costing more than $70,000,000 , which failed to get PWA financing . Chief support for the bridge has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Circumferential Parkway below Hamilton Avenue . Park Association 's Views The Park Association of New York City , while not passing on the desirability of a bridge as outside the scope of the organization , strongly approved yesterday the relandscaping and reconstruction of Battery Park as proposed by Mr. Moses in connection with construction of the bridge In a letter to Councilman Hugh Quinn , chairman of the State legislation committee , Mrs. Arthur Hays Sulzberger , president of the association , said : " We have given careful study to the plans submitted by Commissioner Moses , and it appears to us that this design , rather than destroy the park , greatly increases it usefulness and beauty . The present layout is archaic , unattractive and badly cut up by paved walks which radiate in an octopus fashion from meaningless circles . The trees and shrubs are conspicuous principally by their absence . " The new plan provides an attractive promenade on two levels along the waterfront and tree planting similar to that in Bryant Park , which is both decorative and furnishes ample shade . The area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary , is being increased by one-half an acre . We feel that Commissioner Moses ' plan for the development of Battery Park should be adopted whether there is to be a bridge to Battery Park , or a tunnel , or neither . " The Fine Arts Federation of New York , representing eighteen leading art societies in the city , issued a warning that " a bridge with its terminus and approaches at the Battery will seriously disfigure perhaps the most thrillingly beautiful and world-renowned feature of this great city . " A. F. Brinckerhoff , president of the federation , said the people and the city authorities should be clearly informed of the " sacrifice " the bridge would mean before authorizing it . Objections by Civic Groups The joint statement of the civic organizations , asserting the bridge " was conceived in haste , " said no adequate study had been made of possible alternatives and that full discussion of so vast a project had been impossible . " We must deprecate the attempt to make the people believe that delay would be dangerous , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the argument that the bridge was needed primarily to help industrial concerns in South Brooklyn . " It is conceded , " the statement said , " that the commercial traffic crossing the new bridge would be , at the most , about 10 per cent at the start , with an ultimate maximum ratio of 20 per cent of the total traffic . Commercial traffic from the bridge can not enter on the West Side Highway and will be prevented from using the East Side Drive . Only one result can be obtained : the lower end of Manhattan , now crowded to capacity , will be congested by an influx of trucking . " According to the statement , many concerns would continue to use lighters to New Jersey railheads because they would be cheaper than trucking over the bridge and through the Holland Tunnel . " It is therefore as a passenger vehicle artery that this bridge must be judged in the first instance and it seems very clear that it is not even desirable from that point of view , " the statement declared . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which this involves are not justified by such a use . " The statement said that , while army engineers would pass on the bridge as it affects navigation , " we can not in any sense leave to the army engineers its terrible detrimental effect on shipping , in the lower East River and South Brooklyn waterfronts . " " Shipping interests seem agreed that the construction of the bridge will tend to drive shipping from the Port of New York to New Jersey , " it added . The bill in Albany to authorize the Triborough Bridge Authority to build the bridge is defective , " since it obligates the bridge authority to pay ' only the estimated cost and expense of acquiring lands ( as estimated by the contract ) , but not the actual cost , " and because it " does not obligate or even give permission to the authority to build all the necessary approaches , " the statement said . ' WASHINGTON VIEW IN DOUBT Ickes and RFC Question Effect on Existing Securities Special to Tint NEW Yosir TIMES . ALBANY , March ** @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interior , and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation regarding the proposed Battery-toBrooklyn bridge were somewhat clarified today when copies of their letters on the subject were made public here by Assemblyman Abbot Low Moffat , chairman of the Ways and Means Committee . Both letters were addressed to Alfred B. Jones , chairman of the New York City Tunnel Authority , Mr. Ickes writing as Public Works Administrator and the letter from the RFC being signed by G. R. Cooksey , secretary . Mr. Ickes 's letter , dated March 15 , said : " I have your letter of March 4 , 1939 , with reference to the pending bills under which it is proposed to take away from the Tunnel Authority the power to construct the Battery tunnel , and confer upon the Triborough Bridge Authority the power , with the consent of the purchasers and holders of the Tunnel Authority bonds , to construct the proposed Brooklyn-Battery bridge . " We feel that the security for the bonds of the Tunnel Authority , purchased and to be purchased by the Public Works Administration , might be seriously impaired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency . If this be the case , we could not consent to the modification of the existing covenants of the State of New York to permit the construction of the Brooklyn-Battery bridge project . " In view of your request for a statement of our attitude in the matter , we wish to call your attention to the fact that the enactment of the two bills into law would prevent the construction of the battery tunnel by the Tunnel Authority and ( unless we consented thereto ) the construction of the Brooklyn-Battery bridge project by the Triborough Bridge Authority . " In consequence of such enactment the Public Works Administration might be faced with the alternative of consenting to en inv. pairment of its security or preventing the construction of any vehicular facility connecting the Battery and Brooklyn . Needless to say , the pressure of opinion to which we might be subjected in such case would be very great , and I feel that it is undesirable , both from the point of view of the City of New York and from our own point of view , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Furthermore , you should know that , in determining whether to grant or withhold our consent to the construction of the bridge , we shall feel free to decide solely upon the basis of the effect upon our security and without consideration of the unfortunate consequences that might ensue from a withholding of such consent . " The RFC letter , dated March 22 , said : " In the absence of ' any request concerning its views from either of the committees handling the bills in the Assembly and the Senatetrof the State of New York , this corporation has not stated its position with reference to the proposed amendments . This corporation would not favor any legislation which , by its express terms , would impair the value of any bonds it holds ! ' Mr. Moffat said the letters " show clearly " that Mr. Ickes and the RFC were " avoiding any commitment pending a determination as to whether their rights as bondholders are impaired by the bills . " The copies were sent to Mr. Moffat by the New York City Tunnel Authority .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
