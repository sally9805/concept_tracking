One hot damp morning last week , ten U. S. Marines with a roll of telephone wire rode on mule-back along a narrow road under the shadow " of towering , jungle-clad mountains near the Honduras border . Their job was to repair a telephone wire that somebody had cut during the night , their only thought was to finish the job and get back to barracks before lunch . Near a straggling corn patch they found the broken end of the wire drooping from a pole . Though this was the most dangerous district in Nicaragua , the Marines had had no serious trouble for months . The party did not bother to send out patrols . One private shinnied up the pole with a pair of pliers in his teeth , others stretched new wire along the ground . Sergeant Arthur M. Palrang , in the manner of sergeants directing operations , sat on his mule . <P> From the underbrush on four sides came a crackle of rifle fire . The man on the pole fell to the ground dead . The Marines deployed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two and a half hours the battle kept up . It was a quiet fight . Nicaraguan guerillas dare not waste cartridges . There were long , heartbreak ing silences . Whenever the ambushers shot they made sure of their marks . <P> With half the Marine patrol dead , Sergeant Palrang ordered Private Mack Hutcherson to crawl back , try to get reinforcements . He never got through - two bullets laid him out with a shattered arm . <P> About noon a frightened Nicaraguan farmer arrived at Marine headquarters at Ocotal babbling that a massacre was taking place . While he talked a mule belonging to one of the wiring party galloped riderless down the village street . A rescue party was rushed to the scene . Of the ten Marines , only two were living . The dead men had been hacked . to pieces with machetes , their rifles , shirts and shoes stolen . Eleven dead Nicaraguans were sprawled nearby . <P> Same day a band of 100 Nicaraguan insurgents twice attempted to raid the Guardia Nacional barracks at Quilali , were beaten off . Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scouting for the band that had wiped out the repair crew , fought off an ambush of 150 outlaws , but not before two Marines had been wounded . <P> The death of eight Marines brought plenty of repercussion in Washington . Democratic Senator King of Utah announced that he would introduce a resolution immediately demanding the withdrawal of U. S. troops from Nicaragua . <P> " We have been in the habit of intervening too much in foreign lands , " cried he , " It is bound to provoke and has provoked resentments and feelings of ill will on the part of the Latin Americans . " <P> Added Senator Borah : " I am of the opinion as I always have been , that we ought not to be in there . " <P> The Women 's International League for Peace &; Freedom sent an open letter to President Hoover : " The unfortunate death of these . . . human beings is the result of a United States policy which we believe ' is neither intelligent nor ethical . May we , therefore , respectfully inquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delayed pledge of two administrations by setting a definite date for the withdrawal of troops from Nicaragua ? . . .
