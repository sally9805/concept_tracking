A shrewd , genial , supersalesman is Archie Moulton Andrews , board chairman and largest stockholder of Hupp Motor Car Corp . In 1932 when this arch-promoter was backing the sale of securities in packages of one share each in 25 or 50 companies , he confidently expected his merchandise to become the " Ford of the American investment business . " When he was pushing his Elektrolite cigaret lighter , he used to rub his hands over the 120,000,000 U. S. birthdays as prospective gift sales , crowing : " Give me 5% of them and I 'll make $10,000,000 . " A sworn foe of Wall Street , which warmly reciprocates his sentiments , he once declared : " I 'm no angel but these directors who short their own stock-why , I sold out my stock before the Crash , but I kept every share of those in which I was connected with the management . That little gesture cost me $75,000,000 . " <P> Boss of Hupp for half a year , Archie Moulton Andrews last week announced a new wrinkle in automobile merchandising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The " adventure " : <P> Each of the 250,000 Hupmobile owners in the U. S. will be asked to send to the company the names of at least four prospective Hupmobile buyers . " We acknowledge this service with a trifling gift-a flameless cigaret lighter " ( presumably Mr. Andrews ' own Elektrolite ) . The suggested names are turned over to the Hupp sales organization , which will then try some " modified high-pressure . " If one of the suggested prospects actually buys a Hupmobile , the person who sent in the name will receive a commission of $20 by going on the Hupp payroll at $5 a week for one month . Nothing is deducted from the salesman 's or dealer 's commission . Later Mr. Andrews expects to employ more of the public " with a consequent wider distribution of salary checks . . . . There is no limit to the number of names that can be sent . And the salaries we will pay will go up in proportion to the number of sales . " <P> In the first year Mr. Andrews hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company by means of this profit-spreading device can add that much money to the gross income of the people , " said Promoter Andrews , " think what it will mean when the plan is adopted by a hundred other large industries . It opens a new era , new vistas of prosperity , wholly in keeping with the policies which compose the New Deal . "
