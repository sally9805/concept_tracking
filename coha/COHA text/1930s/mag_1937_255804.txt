Proprietor Everett ( " Shep " ) Hurd would not have been at all surprised one day last month when three undersized young men bought two .45 Colt automatics and a generous supply of ammunition , except for one fact . <P> <P> All three wore city clothes and they talked in a kind of English that sounded strange to Maine ears . <P> When the men left , after ordering another Colt and a .35 automatic Winchester rifle , promising to drop in to get them in a few weeks , Proprietor Hurd , to be on the safe side , called the Bangor police .
