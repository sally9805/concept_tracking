Across a wrestling ring in Manhattan 's Madison Square Garden last week two men growled and glowered at each other . Squatting in one corner , wearing a fancy ruby-colored robe with turban to match , was Arteen Ekizian , 30-year-old Turk , one time fish-peddler , U. S. sailor and Hollywood " extra . " To 5,000 raucous spectators he was Ali Baba , the Terrible Turk of whom posters asked IS HE MAN OR BEAST ? Ali Baba 's head resembled a speckled ostrich egg . His upper lip was hidden behind a sweeping pair of handle bar mustachios . His teeth were jagged and irregular . His short legs which sup ported his 205 Ib. wabbled like an ape 's . <P> In the other corner was his opponent , Dick Shikat . One of the few professional wrestlers whose repertoire includes some genuine wrestling holds , Shikat was diligently working up a great hate with which to defend his " world 's wrestling championship " against the Terrible Turk for the second time . Two weeks before , Baba had trounced him in Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This billing was not recognized by the New York State Athletic Commission which demanded another bout , this time in Manhattan , to prove the Turk 's rightful claim . <P> As last week 's bout began , both wrestlers yammered , screamed , snorted , grunted , growled , moaned . Shikat 's nose dribbled blood from Baba 's crushing headlocks and resounding slaps . Each diligently tied the other into knots . Shikat stood the Turk on his head , bounced him up &; down . When , after 53 minutes of mauling , Shikat began to lose enthusiasm and the shoe polish from Baba 's mustache dripped onto his hairy chest , the latter pinned Shikat with what Announcer Joe Humphreys identified as a flying crotch hold and body press . With this hold , Ali Baba became the fifth person in the U. S. currently claiming the World 's Wrestling Championship . <P> Last week 's match appeared genuine if for no other reason than Shikat 's an nounced aversion to " fixed " bouts . This testimony was revealed last month when one Joe Alvarez , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep Shikat from wrestling Baba in Detroit . Shikat frankly admitted that before three recent bouts , a man had pushed his way into his dressing room , instructed him to " lay down , " lose the match . These orders he had faithfully executed until last March . Then , indignant at having to lose all the time , he disobeyed his dressing room order by pinning Champion Danno O'Mahoney in a world championship match . At this testimony Promoter Jack Curley , who with five others rules the wrestling world today , exploded . Such a thing as a " - fixed " match , he yelped , was unknown to him . <P> High-minded sportswriters who sputtered indignantly at these revelations forgot what revolutionary changes had occurred in a sport which now grosses $5,000,000 a year from the U. S. public . In the days of Farmer Burns and Frank Gotch wrestling was , indeed , an exhibition of skill and strength . When Ed ( " Strangler " ) Lewis , Stanislaus Zbyszko and Joe Stecher began to trade their " world championships " with peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1920 's the sport sank deep in the doldrums .
