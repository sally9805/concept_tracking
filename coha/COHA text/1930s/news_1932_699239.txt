txt Republicans and the Bonus . To the Editor of The Now York Times : The Democratic party was at the helm in Washington when the United States entered the World War . At that time , in order to obviate any pension system ( bonus ) , the administration said the United States will offer to every soldier , sailor and marine the opportunity to insure his life  --  despite the risks of war ? at rates lower than any insurance company could deem it ' advisable to take for ordinary life insurance . This policy was undertaken on the theory that this government should never go through the periods of pension abuses which it had gone through as a result of its previous wars . Is it not a fact that from March 4 , 1921 , until December , 1931 , the Republicans were in control of the administrative and both branches of the legislative departments of the government ? And is it not true that during that time all questions of special payments to veterans in general , and of the so-called bonus bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the Democrats or Republicans responsible for the bonus issue ?
