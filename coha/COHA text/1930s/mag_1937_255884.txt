Tense with anxiety , the 209,000,000 people of the Mohammedan world , only 30,000,000 of whom are citizens of states ruled by Mohammedans , followed day by day last week the violent efforts of Palestine 's Christian rulers to break Arab resistance to their scheme of carving up the Holy Land into three parts : a Jewish state and an Arab state divided by a British corridor ( TIME , July 12 et seq . ) . <P> Unable were the Christian authorities recently to prevent the escape from British-mandated Palestine to French-mandated Syria of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem , spiritual leader of 800,000 Arabs . Last week they got back at him by seizing the Moslem Religious Funds ( the chief Moslem charitable and religious organization in Palestine ) , hitherto under the Grand Mufti 's control . This organization has been carrying on charitable work to the value of $1,000,000 per year . When the Christians placed these funds under the direction of a board consisting of two Christians and one Mohammedan , all Islam felt a sense of outrage and all over Palestine irate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabs , choosing a moment when guards of the Christian Lydda Airport had relaxed their patrol and were resting in a watchman 's hut , set fires which caused airport buildings and equipment to burn last week for a loss of $100,000 . Next , the police station at Daharieh , between Hebron and Beersheba , was overwhelmed by Arabs who made off with the Christian policemen 's arms , shouting : " Tell your English bosses to go drink whiskey and play football ! They should not think they can fight us . We will drive them out of Palestine ! " <P> Before dawn next morning strange Christian soldiers wearing skirts , newly arrived from the United Kingdom , speaking with a thick burr and known as the Black Watch , surrounded Daharieh , ostentatiously showing their weapons . Emboldened by the Black Watch 's presence , the disarmed Christian police demanded that the Moslem villagers restore their arms , roughly ordered Moslem women to aid them in searching cellars . Having found no weapons , the Christians set charges of dynamite under the houses of three prominent Arab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blown to smithereens . Finally the Christians , after sending their patrol to mark other Arab homes , announced : " We are prepared to spare one house for each rifle returned . " <P> No rifles had been returned at latest dispatches , and Christians were blowing up still more Moslem homes in reprisal for the burning of the airport . The Mohammedan world , familiar with the methods of a Christian whom they called " The Strongman of Bengal " when he was police commissioner of Calcutta , was incensed to learn that Strongman Sir Charles Augustus Tegart is being sent to Palestine . Next they learned that in Daharieh the Christians , not satisfied with dynamiting houses in reprisal for the capture of a few rifles , had levied a collective fine of $10,000 on the whole village . Since the Moslem villagers were too poor to pay , their sheep , cattle and movable household goods to a value of $10,000 by Christian estimates were to be seized by the skirt-wearing Black Watch and carried off to the braying of bagpipes.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
