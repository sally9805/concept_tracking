hipshi V. McKee , pleaayoforrofa crue saYdeork , hdice-h would bring decent government to the sadly misruled city , his hearers at the annual dinner of the New York State Chamber of Commerce looked upon him as a messiah . Bankers , real-estate operators , business men crowded around the Mayor at the conclusion of his brief speech to voice their vigorous approval . Practically all the newspapers joined in editorial praise of the new crusader . Municipal reformers and fusion advocates , relegated to outer political darkness since the Mitchel administration almost two decades ago , immediately initiated a reform campaign . Leaders of local chambers of comrnerce , women 's clubs , and civic associations joined the movement . A newspaper cartoonist pictured McKee as a knight in shining armor spearing the Tammany dragon . Certain reform groups , however , have held aloof waiting to see in what direction McKee would jump in 1933 , and hoping , perhaps , that Al Smith might be willing to carry the spear in the next city election . The role of reformer is a new one for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has been little in his fairly long political career to distinguish him from the general run of New York 's Democratic leaders . For a time he held an instructorship in Latin and Greek at Fordham University ; this and a brief period as teacher at De - Witt Clinton High School preceded his selection by the Bronx Democratic machine as a candidate for the lower house of the State legislature . He spent six years at Albany . His legislative service is best remembered for his attempt to bring down the maximum price of prize-fight tickets from $25 to $7 . When the infamous ouster of the Socialist assemblymen was proposed , McKee urged that they be tried by the entire lower house rather than by a special committee  --  this during a period when even conservative Republican leaders with a sense of propriety denounced the entire procedure . It was Governor Smith who called McKee from his place in the assembly to fill a vacancy on the City Court bench . He was reelected to serve for ten years . In summing up his experiences on the bench , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my mind that there are always two sides to a question . " A highly religious strain , which is noticeable especially in his utterances before student bodies , led him , when he first assumed judicial office , to ask an audience of Tammany leaders and heelers to pray for his success in his new job , and one of the few innovations introduced during his presidency of the Board of Aldermen was to have the meetings opened with prayer . In 1927 and again within recent months lIvIcKee took occasion to lash out at rowdy shows and he closed two burlesque houses for a short space of time . On one occasion , when certain movies seemed to him too broad in their handling of the idiosyncrasies of foreign elements in our population , Mr. McKee proposed an ordinance designed to clear New York 's screens of all pictures that might offend racial groups . Like his predecessor , though he is not so adept at the art , Mayor McKee appreciates the value of showmanship . Hehas repeatedly lavished rich but equal praise on every foreign-language group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has extended the city 's welcome to the MetroGoldwyn-Mayer lion , to bright little Japanese girls fresh from a young ladies ' seminary , and to Sidney Franklin , Brooklyn 's matador , To a delegation of school teachers seeking salary increases he once offered the consolation that not in many years had the aldermanic chamber seen " such a good-looking assemblage of women . " As for the industrial breakdown , he considers that it has wrought " one of the greatest social revolutions in history . It has brought new ideals ... men are lifting up their minds and hearts . " A major cause of the depression , he feels , has been the excessive taxing of real estate . McKee 's apprenticeship in the Board of Estimate , where he sat for seven years as president of the Board of Aldermen , was a period of close cooperation with Mayor Walker . The ties were loosened only when Walker 's star began to fade in the cold light of public exposure . McKee sat in on the proceedings which jammed through the Equitable Bus franchise , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined fight to swing the deal by which it was proposed to net his associates the modest profit of $19,000,000 in ten years , did McKee waver . When the news leaked out concerning a series of secret conferences at which the Tammany bosses , along with Walker and McKee , had sought to resolve the clashing ambitions of bus promoters and political backers , McKee announced that he would take no further part in secret meetings on the subject . At the same time he made haste to explain that his action implied no criticism of Mayor Walker . In the Board of Estimate he voted with Walker at every turn to hasten the Equitable deal , and McKee and Henry Bruckner , president of the borough of the Bronx , were Walker 's sole aids during many months of the protracted siege . During his first years as aldermanic president , McKee functioned as a sort of prime minister for Mayor Walker . It was McKee 's practice then to send Walker an annual letter on the state of the city government . One of the achievements of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his " settlement of the bias awards . " And in the face of the Equitable fiasco McKee lent himself again in 1931 to an effort to jam through questionable bus awards in the borough of Queens , turning down a better but politically unsupported offer which would have netted the city an extra income of half a million a year . Exposure of the deal by the City Affairs Committee forced McKee to beat a hang retreat , with no adequate explanation offered of his change of heart . Walker could count on McKee 's support in other important matters . In 1926 he voted in favor of leasing Piers. 84- and 86 in the Hudson River to the United American lines for $570,000 a year , which he considered " a substantial and adequate return . " Three years later the transaction was found to be shot through with corruption . Judge Bern'rd Vause , now in the Atlanta penitentiary , was found to have received $250,000 from the steamship lines with which to facilitate granting of the leases . McKee was a full if silent partner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary to- $40,000 a year and his own to $25,000 a year . Perhaps the best indices to Mayor McKee 's social concepts are his views on education and housing . In his budget-slashing campaign , educational items have ' been his particular targets . " When children are in school after fourteen years of age something has happened to American ideals , " he declared at a budget hearing . He fought for complete elimination of the provision by which unemployed men and women have been able to spend their idle time in continuation schools and in vocational study ; he wanted school athletic centers closed ; he disapproved of expenditures on summer schools and school gardens and for the teaching of international relations in the colleges and universities . He felt that classes now averaging thirty-nine pupils to a teacher might well be enlarged . Raising his hands in horror at the coddling of the school children , McKee wanted to know " where education is going to stop . " " All this care is softening the children up . Let them go out at fourteen and earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His tactics led to hysterical attacks on the entire school system from representatives of the real-estate boards . With McKee 's approval they demanded an end to the " racket " by which teachers on sick leave receive compensation . Demands of the real-estate interests have led him into a completely anti-social position on housing . When the Reconstruction Finance Corporation announced its intention of lending $6,000,000 to a limited-dividend corporation for the construction of reasonably priced apartments in the Bronx , the real-estate operators of his home borough denounced the plan . McKee listened sympathetically and then attacked the R. F. C. as a meddler . The Bronx , he said , did not need any new apartments ; it was a borough without a slum . He went sa far as to propose a municipal ordinance which would bar tax exemption to the proposed venture . There is little excuse for McKee 's ignorance of housing conditions in his home borough ; and there is no apparent explanation for his opposition to the project except his willingness to serve the real-estate owners who have thousands of empty high-priced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Tenement House Department for 1931 reveal that there are 31,332 condemned , old-law apartments in the Bronx and that more than 90 per cent of them are inhabited by families who can not afford anything better . Clarence A. Stein , former chairman of the State commission on housing and regional planning , has described the great Bronx building boom of 1920 to 1930 as adding immensely to " potential slums . " ? " In the Bronx , " said Mr. Stein , " speculative builders continued to cover every inch of ground not devoted to streets or narrow courts with six-story monstrosities where most of the rooms looked out across a six-by-twelve-foot court on whitewashed walls decorated only with hideous fire escapes or on , equally sunless streets . Poor ventilation , little or no-sunlight , no sign of green , and dangerous streets . " This , , concluded Mr. Stein , is the housing of the next fifty to a hundred years in- the " borough without a slum . " Enough-has been related here to reveal the character of ' vtayor McKee , ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . and also to indicate his shortcomings as a municipal leader devoted to broad social service . Two typical acts of McKee 's since he succeeded to Mayor Walker 's chair will complete the picture . One of the most audacious of his steps was his discharge of Commissioner of Markets Dwyer when the latter failed on short notice to present a plan for operating the Bronx Terminal Market at a profit to the city . It is difficult , however , to understand why McKee did not speak up earlier , since Judge Seabury has just shown that the market lost $2,889,570 of the city 's money in the years 1929 , 1930 , and 1931 . Praise of McKee rose high when he delivered a ukase against the expensive limousines of Tammany leaders . He was informed in 1927 that these cars were costing the city $1,000,000 a year , but then he did not see fit to notice the complaint . As a matter of fact , in his first year as president of the Board of Aldermen , McKee spent more city money on automobiles than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first acts was to have the city buy him a limousine at a cost of $7,780 and provide a chauffeur at $2,500 a year . Of course the reigning prince of Tammany , James J. Walker , discarded four old cars which had been good enough for his predecessor and treated himself to four new ones at a total cost of $26,880 . But McKee soon learned . By the end of 1926 two chauffeurs were assigned to his office ; by 1929 there were three ; in 1930 his office had at its disposal four Cadillacs and a Packard and the use of three chauffeurs costing $7,380 a year , with incidental expenses of $4,860 . McKee has a good chance to be elected mayor of New York City next year . In November , though his name was not on the ballot , he received the startling number of 232,501 votes . It is estimated that his final vote would have been four or five - hundred thousand had it not been for the difficulties involved in writing in his name . An alliance with the hungry Republican boss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seeking any deal which will give him a few crumbs , would certainly give him most of the 442,901 votes which went to Mr. Pounds . Edward J. Flynn , Bronx Democratic boss , who is close to President-elect Roosevelt , will do all in his power to win Roosevelt 's backing , though his efforts will no doubt meet the counterbalancing influence of James A. Farley , who always prefers a deal to an open fight . But his election would mean little in the way of reform or of meeting the sodal needs of the city . He might prune the more obviously dishonest sections of the budget . He might bring about the consolidation of county offices , which would save at the most some $500,000 a year , Appearing before Judge Seabury , he did favor proportional representation but his plan for reorganization was distinctly inferior to the proposals of Al Smith . The chief danger is that he would put through an economy program designed to curtail rather than extend the city 's social services . A reform administration headed ' by Mayor McKee promises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find themselves once more trapped by a leadership which made no pretense of attacking constructively the problems of housing , transit , education , health , and recreation . Only a program of municipal socialism backed by an organization ready to square the issues between reform and social reconstruction can solve these problems . Already the Socialist campaigns of Norman Thomas and Morris Hillquit , supplemented by the day-by-day fruitful work of the City Affairs Committee , have given us a base on which to build . The program for such a movement is indicated by the very shortcomings in the present reform program . The reformers ' plans for efficiency and economy would certainly be the beginning of such a program  --  though it would eliminate the false economy which penalizes low-salaried municipal em-s ployees and saves money at the expense of education , health , and recreation facilities . Affirmatively , such a program would include a unified , municipally owned subway , elevated , and bus system whose management would be shared by workers , technicians , and representatives of the voters ; the development of publicly owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time , by competition and acquisition , supplant the private utilities ; establishment of a municipal milk-distributing agency run for service and not for profit ; a public housing program which would be especially beneficial in meeting the unemployment problem ; the shifting of the tax burden to improved real-estate values , whereby the city 's principal source of taxation revenue would be derived from an assessment which would expropriate the rental value of land ; proportional representation designed to end the unequal distribution of power which now gives Tammany a free hand ; and the safeguarding of the ballot , which might be accomplished by drawing election inspectors from Civil Service lists rather than from district clubhouses and ? by improving the voting-machine so that it would automatically register the final vote and eliminate the practice of making false transcriptions of the vote from the machine to the official return blanks .
