SEASONED TIMBER-Dorothy Canfield - Harcourt , Brace ( $2.50 ) . <P> Dorothy Canfield lives in and writes about Vermont , a sensible State where a lady 's hat , to be up to the moment , needs only to be a decent shelter for the head . One might expect Author Canfield , therefore , to be impervious to literary fashion as well . But so many tucks , ribbons and feathers have been incorporated into the novel since she last wrote one ( Bonfire , 1933 ) , that she has felt it necessary to come up to date . The result sits on her head at a rakish angle , tapers to a giddy point . The angle : fascism is dangerous . The point : it ca n't happen here . The effect : distinctly overdressed . <P> Some years ago , Dorothy Canfield , in her nonliterary self ( Mrs. John Redwood Fisher ) , served on Vermont 's State Board of Education , found that small village schools were so hard up for chalk , books , blackboards , maps , to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would gladly pawn even their academic freedom for a little ready cash . This , at any rate , is the premise of Seasoned Timber . <P> Villain of the piece is a Wall-Streeter named George Wheaton , a graduate of tiny , semipublic , coeducational Clifford Academy . He wants to give Clifford one of his easy millions , on condition that the school become private , preferably for boys only , and that Jews be excluded . <P> The deal would go through were it not for the school 's lovable principal , Timothy Hulme . Uncle Tim is a procrastinator from way back , but he can tell fascism from fooling . He has put off marrying so long that when he finally falls in love , it is with a girl who might be his daughter ; he delays proposing to her so long that she is wooed and married by his nephew before he has even heaved a deep sigh . But the minute Mr. Wheaton 's poisoned sugarplum comes along , Uncle Tim gets his back up . He succeeds in keeping it away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the end-well , a slowpoke ca n't have everything .
