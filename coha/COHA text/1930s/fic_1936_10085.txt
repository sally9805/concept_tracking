side-down this morning : it always looked brand new , upsidedown , with new colors and shapes , all amazingly suggestive of the right-side-up yet far finer . Around the corner of the low brick-and-wood school buildingthe teacher strolled . In a moment the bell would ring . Tom hissed through his large and doggish teeth and jumped up from the ground . When he landed , he began to run for Danny . He had his head down and his fists charged the air and beat his way . An imp of fury had him , and made him faster than he could have been , and meaner than anyone expected . He butted Danny in the belly with all his force . It knocked them both down . Danny was astonished not having seen this coming . He was sick , from the shock to his stomach . He began to cry . Leaping in agony and trying to catch his breath , he saw Tom McBride standing before him suddenly finished with what he had done . Danny shrieked . He weakly threw himself on Torn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tom backed up but hardly defended himself . The teacher came running . They were obliged to come at noon to her desk and stand while she made a little sermon ; then she required them to shake hands . They did this without looking at each other . They managed to leave the room separately . The next clay Danny opened his desk where he kept things so neatly and lovingly . In the middle of the little clear space at the center of the desk was a new penknife . He examined it with a lump of anguish and delight under his heart . He opened all the blades and tried them and closed them in various sequences , trying out every combination of ar-pIOIrangements . He tried out which pocket it felt best in . It was white and it gleamed with nickel . He did n't wonder where it came from until these more abstractpleasures had been tasted . He looked around at the other children . They were all busy , dreaming or reading . Presently he saw Tom McBride , hunching and scowling yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tom nodded and grinned under his scowl and pushed his fingers into his nose and hitched in his seat . Danny held up the knife and pointed at it and then at Tom and then at himself . Tom nodded . Danny blushed and felt a shiver of something strange travel his bowels and his very sitting bones . Then the teacher closed a drawer of her desk with a bright neatness and smiled and began with , " Well , children : "  |p102Tom  THIS , AND TOM THAT , TOM-TOM-TOM , " SAIDIrma , bustling between the stove , the counter , the ice-box , the tables out front . It was angry pride and secret lonesomeness . She gladly had her boy with the doctor 's son ; folks might think it funny ; but she thought it quite right , even though she did have to work in a restaurant with smelly old kitchen and a monkey of a Chinaman . It was n't any more'n right and proper that Irma Milford 's baby should spend his time with the nicest children in town , anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next year or two or three , they grew more than in such a period ever before . Irma would regard them changing from time to time , and compute Danny 's growth along with the savings account she had in the red brick and white stone bank down on the corner ; and firmly nod her head at the way her plans were working out . The rates of growth in both her possessions were about parallel . When the time came , they could go , all right . Now a new world opened out before Danny . He was no longer alone . He found himself changing from the shyness of himself among others of his kind , and he found Tom McBride willing to take him everywhere and show him everything of that double world which looks entirely differentto children and to their elders . He found that Tom was just as excited and stimulated by Danny 's private world of the maps , the uses of magic , the value of speculation as Danny was by Tom 's actual world.  |p103That  suggested the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into dreams ; Tom found entire satisfaction in the physical ways of life , and simply widened his knowledge of them whenever he could . Further , Tom had wisdoms that Dan eagerly shared . They would steal illustrated books out of Doctor McBride 's office in the afternoons and go out with them to the barn behind the doctor 's house , and there laugh in whispers about the immodestiesthey found in the pictures . They were like monkeys in their excitements , unashamed and unaware of any meaning in what they did , but simply gratified . They decided to have a secret society , limited to themselves . The most they did with the idea was discuss exquisite and incredibleinitiations which new members would have to undergo , rites of obscenity and feats of strength , perhaps even the smoking of a cigar . " Where would we get the cigar ? " " We could steal it , " said Tom . They both looked and shivered at each other . Soberly they came down out of the barn loft , and impressed by their consciences with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Danny went home . With some fierce intuition , that night Irma cuddled him as she told him it was time to go to bed . She suddenly ached with longing and with devices in her head and heart for Danny grown up . He was a handsome small boy , large-headed and nearly nine years old . She made him look into her eyes , and tell her if he was sure , certain , swearin' ' - true that he was a good boy and would be a good man . There was nothing of sin on his soul that could have done more than exasperate her briefly , and make her scold him ; but now challenged so , hepI04 blushed and stammered ; he lost his saliva and his eyes turned wild as if light were going inward and revealing him utterly . He thought of the kind of misdemeanor he and every boy he knew had done now or then . . . little depredations , little lies , foolish lusts and misunderstood compulsions ; and she saw these thought-changes happen in him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight bones and soft flesh with her large working fingers . " Daniel Milford Junior ! Have you done anything you ca n't tell mother about ! " He gulped and remembered that terrible thing about perhapsstealing a cigar . She looked fierce and hot . Her black eyes danced and snapped . Feebly he clutched at the one hope he saw , which was that they had not yet actually stolen the cigar , and maybe might not ever do so . He felt wretched . He wished she would n't do things like this . It was time to meet them . He dropped his head , and shook it , for " no , " and murmured " uh , uh . " She took his chin and lifted his face . " I 'm glad . You 're sure ? " He looked up , clear-eyed to her pleasure , and wounded her with delight in the way he said , " I ai n't done anything . " " That 's right , " she said , nodding firmly . " Do n't say ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm working hard , and have n't time for the fancies and the rights of this and that . But I do n't want my baby-boy t'get habit of speaking wrongly . " She had recovered their feelings for them , in this brisk little tirade , full of humorous complaint . Now she made him stand up from his chair , and she shoo 'd him to bed , laughing , way-pI05ing her hands after him , and turning back to the table to waste a little time ; for he was growing and she believed he hated to have her watch him undress and get into his long sleeping gown ; therefore she sat at the table and looked across the room away from him out the window , where the nightly town lay revealed , and made her think , " Now I wonder what ever made me come here in the first place , and what ever made me stay on here in the second place ! " , but the answers were unknown to her , and she shook her head at herself for wondering and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her.  |p106DANNY  SPENT ONLY HIS TIMES FOR SLEEPING AT HOME any more . School had him most of the week ; but after school , he was loud and active among the boys who fought wars on the edges of town , wide dirt streets that straggled suddenly and turned into brown plains widening to the flat horizon . They fought wars with sticks and wooden rifles and stones , and much silent oratory of gesture , defiance that welled from deeper than they knew . With Tom , Danny wandered all the places of the town and its sources . They began to go down to the tracks and hang around the trainmen and watch the engines switching up and down in the late afternoon . Sometimes they wanted to see the night freight go out , and would stay until after dark , shaken to their frames by the voom and fuss of steam as the engine lingered . They would always regard the engine with awe , trying to realize that this up close was the same locomotive that from across the plain looked like a shining new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry of immense utility about it , unlovely and crude in its details , with warts of steamy sweat on its iron hide , oozing rust from its throbbing plates , pissing water with violence in some places and in others , leaks with slovenly dripping ; the plates crazily bolted and loosely jointed , that whined and sang when the engine rocked along the track . The freight went out usually between eight and nine . When it was gone , the darkness closed in after its brilliant headlight and the wind of sparks from the firedoor , and the two boysp107would think " Gee ! " and hurry home more or less dreading the corner where they would separate and go on alone . They noticed presently that a fat and rugged old brakeman would swing his lantern at them and peer at them as if to scare them away ; shake his gray head at them and wobble his loose toothless cheeks . They began to hide , on their evening expeditions to the tracks , so he would n't see them . They thought of him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnest cheeks , jaws , lips , even nose , of a hound , the hound 's brooding pessimismin his pale eyes . " Duck , hey , there 's Dogface . " " Orright , Mr. Dogface , I see you . " They edged around between the baggage truck and the end wall of the station and watched the old brakeman come heavilyshambling down the platform in his grease-velvety overalls . It was still light enough to see without the lantern . He was shaking his head and musing . The boys crouched . " Mr. Dogface , what 's he want : " They believed he wanted to have them arrested , among other things . They thought perhaps he might want to kidnap them . Perhaps he had a sawmill where he privately sawed young boys up for dog meat . He came closer and they cowered behind the truck . They averted their faces . Appallingly , he stopped by them as if his progress was dreadfully designed to bring them together . They squeezed their eyes shut . They heard him whistle in his lungs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asthma . " Hey , you , you two kids , there , now : " he said.  |p108They  crouched lower and covered their faces . " Now , there , you kids , " he sighed in a thick voice . " Get up , I ai n't goin ' to hurt you . Come on . " They looked up . He was waggling his loose old face at them and standing humorously with his great belly pushed out and his head forward . " Come on . " He nodded . They got up and stood before him . " Praise the Lord , " he remarked , reminiscently , and then said , " C'mere , now : listen to me : " He led them to the edge of the walk . The tracks gleamed off darkening in the evening distance . " Oh Lord , guide these children , " he said , putting his hands on their shoulders . " Stay away from these here railroad yards , now , you two kids . Idd n't any place for a pair of youngsters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children hanging around places like this , where they can get hurt , or tempted , or led away , astray , Glory , Glory ! " He was emotional . His eyes were mysteriously fiery . The boys were completely bewildered . " What ? " said Tom . " Just my bounden duty , " said Mr. Dogface , " I am a good man , I have confessed Jesus , Jesus saves , let him save you , my little man .  --  Stay away off'n here . There 's bad men that come here sometimes . Down there by the water-tank , where the trees is , those tramps and hoboes , they stay there days at a time , sometimes . No telling what they might do , see a pair of tykes like you all hanging around . Yes , Jesus ! Oh , oh . " The boys ' imaginations began to gleam . They looked down the tracks toward the red water-tank where it stood amongp109heavy trees . There was a smoky pull of firelight against the dusk , a camp fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You mean down there , Mr. Do  --  , down there the tramps come and camp ? Where the fire is ? " Mr. Dogface sighed and shaggily nodded his head . He was alight with the wonder of God and the power of religion , the zeal of the saved , the doubt of old age that youth can ever find its way . " And they 're bad men : I mean bad , unree-generate , and drowned in the seas of sin ? oh , sinners , you stay away from here . . . " His voice rose in the calm evening by the peaceful freight train and took on a hymnal tone , and the boys thought more than ever of the old hound , dewlapped and moanin ' at the night sky . Their excitement was a warm thing in their veins . " Gee , yes , we will stay away , thanks , Mister . " " I guess my family would feel pretty terrible if I got kidnappedby tramps , or something . " Mr. Dogface nodded with closed eyes . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : go'n now , go'n : oh , praise Him ! " They stumbled away from him , amazed and eager . He made religious noises as they drew away and they forgot that they used to imagine him dangerous , a menace to them ; and not knowing the eating fire of inspiration as it might visit an empty old man with the warming glow of belief , and make him innocent again , and want to share the Lamb , they chuckled and skipped and trotted with their shoulders hunched against the falling chill , and said , " Mr. Dogface ! He 's crazy as a bat ! " and as soon as theypIIO were out of his sight , way past the freight house , they took to the shadows of tool-houses and trees and without having exchanged a word about it , began creeping down toward the tank past which the bonfire showed brightlier now , and the night was coming mysterious , and danger dwelt in the place and men they had been warned about . The early night was quiet . They crept through bushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red tank loomed just above them , dark on the darkening sky . There were several big trees ; two small tool-houses and a clear space of ground covered with grass and sloping like a small hill down on the far side to an irrigation ditch that sometimes had water in it to feed cattle that waited in the pen over across the tracks . The boys now went clown on their stomachs . They crawled with elbow and knee slowly forward until they could see the whole intimate little clearing , where the fire flipped and cracked . There was a can standing in the outer coals of the fire and steam arose from it . On an upended wooden box was a black jacket . But no one was visible . Only the fire lived . They hardly dared whisper . Wind flittering through the leaves in the profuse trees over them made them shiver and look at each other , so much it sounded like whispering and hints of danger . They wanted to see some tramps , and watch what they did . If they did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt be terrible , and talk , and make horrible plans .  --  Then all the more dangerous to overhear such , because if the tramps caught them and knew they knew their secrets , why , then , why , something quite fearful and inexactwould occur . The ground began to thunder as the boys lay on it , nearp111the tracks . The night freight was starting to move out . They craned back across their flat shoulders and saw the lemonyellowbeam of light come quivering along the way and race ahead of the engine in the shining steel tracks . The engine fumed and ground its way . Far , far back along the line the couplings jerked and rang and the squealing train was yanked along into increasing speed . The smoke tasted in the mouths of Tom and Danny where they lay as it went by . The firedoorflung a tiny hell at them and a mesh of sparks . The earth trembled and shook them . They could not hear anythingbut the train . It rollicked past above their very heads . They clenched their teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so near . But they did n't dare move off until all was quiet and they could free themselves safely from their fatal and secret point . A change in the timbre of the tracks told them the end of the train was coming up . They opened their eyes and scrounged around and sure enough , there was the caboose , lighted up like a country church . Far gone was the engine , and fading was the clamor . The evening was about to hush again . On the rear platform of the caboose stood a heavy bellying figure . They recognized Mr. Dogface . He was clutching his lantern . His head was raised to the receding sky over the town . As he passed , the boys heard a stentorian moan of music , and saw the old man 's head turn upward with conviction . The brakeman was singing a hymn . The bumpety banging wheels almost drowned him out , but not quite . The boys felt somehow guilty , seeing him go on so , and they themselves right here where he prayed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly during that passage of the train . Where should they be : but home : Down the track they saw a figure coming dimly out of the dark , and without further subtleties , they turned and ran back toward the station on the slippery cinders of the trackside.  |p113THE  NEXT SATURDAY , DANNY AND TOM TOOK THEIRlunches in boxes and set out to spend the day courting danger . It was an early spring day , and the air was golden and cool . They walked far to the westward until the town was opened behind them in a flat looking cut-out of irregular shapes and heights . Then they started to follow the irrigation ditch that led toward town and kept their eyes on the tall heads of the trees they were aiming at . Across the flat land they could see miniature railroad cars and the little dust-red tank and dark sweeps of shadow dropped by the great trees interrupting the sun . They talked as they went . They stopped now and then to look at bird tracks in the muddy sides of the ditch they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and velvety mud ; and at that , they would kneel down and sink their hands into it , squeezing the mud , slapping it on the dry caked earth above it , and model shapes and surfaces ; then kick their work into lumps , and walk on . The grasses were yellow still from winter 's ways , and brittle . " That Chinaman tried to steal me once , when I was very little , " said Danny . " Who , K'ang-Hsui ? " " Yep . He did . " " Holy Gee . " " My ma found me in his room . " " I bet she give him dickens . " " She might-near killed him . " pI14 " He sure is a funny one .  --  Does he ever talk ? I never heard him talk . " " Funny !  --  He talks when he has to . Most-time he talks his own langwidge to himself , I do n't know what he says . " " He must be old . " " He sure is old . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smells funny . " " My papa says all Chinamen smoke opiun . " " So does K'ang-Hsui . It 's what makes him smell funny . " " Papa says they have to have it after a while . " Danny nodded . " Papa says they 'll steal and kill and lie and everything , only to get it . " " I know , " said Dan , " drug fiend . " Tom looked at him in surprise , respectful . " That 's it . Where 'd you hear that ? " " I read it in the Examiner . They had a long article about it , this girl , she was a big lady , though , married her husband , and he was rich . But he did n't know she was a drug fiend , and they went on a trip , and she could n't get at her drug and finally she told him . It had her picture with diamonds on . " " What did he do : " " Oh , he said she must stop it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and steal and everything , my papa says . " No , she did n't stop it .  --  They had a fight and he killed her . " " Oh . " They walked , satisfied , for a while . The town was getting brighter and darker , realer , as they approached.  | " Gee , I hope K'ang-Hsui keeps on getting his opiun . " " Why ? " " So he wo n't fight and steal and lie and kill to get it . " " Oh . " " You know what ? " " What , " said Tom. "  --  About K'ang-Hsui ?  --  It 's very funny . " Danny skipped and kicked a clod of dirt . It was an embarrassedgesture . " No , what , " asked Tom . " Well , I do n't think he ever goes to the bathroom . " " No ! " Tom stood still and his eyes bulged . Then he giggled and slapped his hip , and laughed aloud , and declared this was not possible . He was a doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so discussing this they walked nearer and nearer the town , engrossed in their argument , relishing it the more because it had no solution and because it dealt with a subject they considered tremendously funny . But suddenly Tom halted and whispered , " Fsss ! we better go carefully now . " They were near the cattle loading-pen to which the irrigationditch led ; and after it passed the white pen , the waterway went on past the grove of trees by the tank , and under the railroad embankment trestle , and was lost on the other side in a small swampy hollow of thick grasses and gaseous mud and damp banks . The boys got to their bellies and began to advance along the ditch-side crawling . They were on an expedition . There might be some tramps camping by the trees . They thought they could see a column of smoke rising into the treetops inpI16the still morning . They put their lunch-boxes on the ground behind a little clump of tall grass and new shoots of poplar root that showed gray twigs and pale green leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cattle-pen . Running and scrambling , they climbed to the top rail of the corral and peered across the distance to the shady grove by the tank . There was somebody there . Now that they were here and the enemy in sight , Tom and Danny were empty of plans . What did they want to do , anyway ? They wanted to see how close they could come to what they regarded as danger , and still not be caught . Anything that made the old brakeman the other night so full of holy sounds and so on , must be pretty bad . They were at an age when anything bad was exciting and promising . They had the projects of adults in their small tough bodies . They saw figures , three , no two : two men moving around in the grove among the blue shadows and the smoky shafts of sunlight that filtered through . They were n't trainmen , because they were in clothes that had different colors , light upper and dark lower ; no gray dark overalls . " There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do : " " We better get down before they see us . " " Yep . " They slid down to the ground . " What d' you guess they 're doing : " " I do n't know . " " Let 's see . " " How we go : " " Look , we get in the ditch and walk squatting over , likep117this , see , and when we get there we can watch them and listen to them , see what they do . " They started down the ditch again . Here the ditch was wider and deeper ; it had dry sides , and only a trickle of water drying along the bottom . The boys trod where the sides rounded and sloped to the bottom . By crouching , they kept out of sight . Presently they were embraced , in the ditch , by the shade of the grove . It was slippery and harder to walk here , because the water collected in a little deep that made a pool . There was less dry sloping ditch-side to walk on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clay-held weeds and grasses , they managed to stay hidden and safe , not more than twenty feet from the shaded center of the camp , where a small fire exhaled , and the two , men sat now , one reading a newspaper , the other scraping mud off his left shoe with a barkcoveredtwig . They were silent . So were the boys . One of the men was old , to them ; like the brakeman , Mr. Dogface . The other tramp was younger ; they judged he was as young as the clerk in the station office , about twenty-six . The older man was heavy and reading his paper , his hands trembled very slowly , so that it seemed as if he might be deliberatelyshaking his hands so ; except that the regular pulse of the shake lasted too evenly and long for that . He had a red face and gray whiskers days in need of shaving . He moved his mouth as he read . He was sitting on a log . The young man jabbed and scraped at the mud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had a heavy face , but younglooking , under black hair . He looked big , sitting . The boys watched so long in silence and the men kept doing the same thing for so long that whole hours of silent time seemed to have passed when the young tramp threw down hispI18 twig and stretched savagely , throwing his arms and dodging with his head and making short grunts . It was an animal gesture ; the boys cowered down a little and gazed wideningly . The young man rolled over on his belly and lay scowling up at the fat companion who went on reading his sedately tremblingpaper . " Yah , what 're you going to do , now , " asked the young man . His voice was resonant and hard . The old man blurted a small scornful laugh and ignored him , and turned a page of the paper with an air of great interest , literacy and even elegance . The boys watched fascinated while the young tramp 's face turned a deep brown red with annoyance , and his almost white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he stared . He rolled a little side to side on his elbows , propping himself , and he seemed to grind his body against the earth in futile anger . He was a big fellow . His hands , closing against his biceps as he had his arms crossed to lean on his elbows , were big and brown . " I said , what'ch going to do : wake up , you old bastard . " " Mind yourself , " replied the other man , in a wet hissing of loose lip and mild character . " Sspeak ssweeter if you have to sspeak at all . " He flipped his paper again and raised his head to look down on the print as if he were wearing glasses . " Oh ,  --  ! " This was an oath . The young one drew himself to a crouch on his knees and then arose in a slow muscular test , bracing out his chest and vainly watching his body modulate in exercise . He wore a blue denim shirt and black corduroy trousers and heavy shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wash my socks . "  |p119He  left the fat one sitting on the log and turned his back and leaned down to unlace his shoes . He took off the shoes and set them preciously on the grass . Then he took off his socks and shook them out . He rolled up his trousers legs . Walking toward the ditch where the water was collected in a little pool , and looked up at from below , he seemed like a giant , and his dark hair fell down across his eyes and made him look like a great boy , scowling and ugly inside . Danny jabbed Tom 's thigh with his thumb , as if to say , " Hey , lookit him coming , what can we : "  --  and there was n't time to finish the thought . The young man had begun scrambling down the bank and sliding when he saw the two boys , and he grabbed at the sliding dirt under him and swore startled . The boys stood up . And he rested there on his tight hams , sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindling over them as if in premonition of thought . His face got pleasanter . He began to grin , and showed his teeth , little even teeth , so little that they seemed merely edges of white under the gums . His lips were thick but well marked . The boys had their hearts drumminglike wings in their shirts . Danny was half grinning in sick surprise at being found ; when Tom hiccuped and said , " C'm on ! " and started to run . " Oh , no , no , you do n't !  --  Hey , wait a minute ! " said the young man , and threw himself swiftly after Tom and grasped him before his movement was hardly on . Danny stood scared moveless . " You let go , you let me go , " said Tom in a hoarse desperate tone.  | " Sure , Spike , when I 'm ready , " said the tramp , and with one heave , hoisted Tom up on the bank edge and then followed him with Danny . He trundled them forward before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look who 's here , Fat , " he said . The fat man looked up and at the boys and then sighed . " You 're after trouble , are you , Oscar : they 'd have the police right on you if you took anything from them . " " Oh , no , they would n't , would they : " said Oscar , bearing his huge thumbs into the boys ' arms until they howled from pain . " Would you ? " " No , let go , hey , no ! Cut it out , " they squealed , like puppies . " Sit down , then , and tell Fat you 'll be glad to stay awhile.  --  Never mind , Fat wo n't hurt you , I 'll see to that ! " This was heavy humor . The boys squatted on one knee , alert and white and not really sure if there was anything fearful in their state . " Now turn out your pockets , " said Oscar . Fat had resumed with the paper , from behind which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mild concern , estimating , while the boys laid on the ground their treasures . Oscar watched with heavying temper . " All that crap ! What else you got ? What could I do with that crap ?  --  Here , I 'll take this . " He leaned down and took Danny 's white penknife that Tom had given him . Danny spontaneously reached for it and Oscar closed it in his veined fist . " Oh , you wo n't let me have this ? " His voice was gently ringing and its mock politeness , the taunting style of his words , made him a puzzle to the boys.  |p121He  looked like a great guy , big and strong and young , maybe he was kidding . " Why , sure , I want it , " said Danny about the knife . " He gave it to me . " " Well , is n't that sweet .  --  Now what else have we here for the good of the lodge ?  --  Look here , Fat , here 's all of a nickel .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " He swept his hand over the pile of buttons , spools , glass marbles , rubber bands , a champagne cork , a glass jewel off the end of a hatpin , and folded bits of paper with lore written down , a broken lead soldier , two rusty keys to nothing , and the rest of the pocket collection , and scattered the objects widely and lost . " You : " He took Danny 's arms and crossed them and began to bend them against each other . His smile got larger and darker and there was a gracious muscular ease in the way he did it that made him seem happy at his craft , while Danny began to cry silently , with tears falling past his white face , and the pain made him breathless and without voice . Tom could hear little gusts like " H ' , h ' , h ' , " in Danny 's throat , and Oscar held the arms at their most painful , and said , " Now , see if we ca n't think of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some dinner . It 's almost dinner time . " Tom leaped up and began to beat on Oscar 's back . " Yes , yes , let him go , I 've got it right here , over there , I 'll get our lunch-boxes . Please , mister , let him go ! " " So you can both run away ! " Oscar laughed indulgently and tightened the bending ofpI22the small arms and Dan cried and his voice caught on and he screamed briefly . " No , I 'll hold on to little brother here while you go and come back with the lunch-boxes . Then we 'll see , if we like the lunch , why , we 'll see . " Tom ran as hard as he could and brought the two lunchpackagesback , and dumped them on Oscar 's lap . " Enough ? " Oscar asked Danny , and Danny , coughingagainst the run of tears and nose , nodded , and was let go . Fat leaned down from his log , to see what the food was . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oscar . Fat sighed , and smiled at the boys , as if to say he was helpless , and so far as he was concerned , he was their friend . He stooped over and the blood rushed to his head turning him fatter still and turkey-colored . He reached into the first opened lunch-box for a hard-boiled egg he saw . Oscar made a fist and knocked the fat old brown and white hand aside . " Hold your water , there , Fat . If they ai n't two of them eggs , I get this one : " " There 's one in my box too , " said Dan . Fat glanced at him gratefully . He rubbed his heavily folded belly that showed with the folds of his shirt and he rubbed his bristling jaw . Oscar found the other egg and let Fat almost take it , almost , al  --  : taunting him by offering and withdrawingit just before grasp , until the babyish ease of the prank bored him and he picked up the egg and tossed it , saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it : " throwing it past Fat so that it lit on the ground and cracked and moistly took in dirt . Fat preserved a curious dignity at that , went and got his egg , broke away the shell , and cleaned it on his shirt . Knowing he was helpless , he knew it would be silly to be evenp123angry , since he could n't support his anger . He bit the egg ; his eyes suddenly watered as the taste flowed into him and he gulped with pleasure . " Look , we got to go , " said Tom . He tried to make his pug face appealing and polite ; but it was white and scared , and desperate ; just so to inspire Oscar . In silent waggery he reached over and took Tom 's ear and began pulling it on and up till the boy yelled . Then he dropped him , and took another bite of his sandwich , and advised neither of them to even want to get away . Oscar and Fat ate ravenously and like dogs , watching each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have the other 's food ; a live wish in Fat 's eye , but not in his arm ; while the boys watched them and felt too hollow for hunger . Fat actually , at one point , waved his sandwich at Dan and said , " Have a bite ? " but withdrew it to finish himself , for Oscar was eyeing it . Oscar sat belching pleasurably.  |p124THE  NOON WAS HOT AND STILL . It could hardly seem that a block away was the station , and the street , and town , just over the tracks there lay home and safety ! The laundry had a whistle that blew for noon . When it sounded now , so familiar and unaware and cheerful , it harriedthe boys , and Tom had an ill lump in his throat , and Danny dragged his palms across his eyes to hide his crying . They had both before in their lives seen deliberate cruelty ; but never before had they been the victims of it . " Ever see this one ? " said Oscar suddenly and hit Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit him on the chin , and as it threw his head back , hit him in the belly , and as his head came over in a crouch of pain , pushed his head down till his back cracked . Tom came out of it and consulted Danny with his white pug face , huge-eyed and staring with torture , but lipped firmly against despair . " Now we ought to make our plans , " said Oscar . He rolled himself over by the log and got comfortable , spreading his legs and pulling his pants out of his crotch and caressing and then crossing his legs . " How long we figger stay here , Fat ? " " We go out tonight .  --  I got ta get to Memphis . " " Tonight . Night freight go out , do n't it : " The boys nodded . " Figger we need some money . Now how we going to get it ? "  | " I have n't got any , I swear I ai n't got a dime , " said Tom . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wonder , " said Oscar . He picked in his teeth with a dried grass and looked at them with his white eyes . He showed his deep gums above his short teeth . " You better let these kidz go , Oscar , I 'm telling you , " said Fat . He nodded ominously . " Plenty trouble get into , police ever hear about it . Never would believe anything you 'd say .  --  You kidz better go , " he added with a sudden flabby decisiveness . The children were up like kittens , then , straining to be gone , yet turning their pointed faces at Oscar as they moved delicately to their haunches for going . Fat was trying to get between them and Oscar ; but his stinking , sagging fat body was unwieldy , and there was the milk of terror in his wet eyes , for Oscar was getting to his feet with a lunging poise and coming on them . " Now Oscar , " cried Fat huskily , flapping his hands at the boys to run while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what I 'm doing : " Oscar savored the physical control he had ; he flexed his big arms , and came strolling upon Fat . The boys were trying to fly ; but this long second hypnotized them ; and it was over in another wink . Oscar opened out his hand and slapped Fat on the face . The noise of it cracked like dry wood and Fat fell down , slobbering . Then Oscar stood still a moment , and looked at the boys . They tried to be sturdy ; they squared their chicken-boned shoulders at him ; Fat was heaping himself together on the ground in a mound of dignity and resignation . He was trembling his fingers on his stinging mouth and his paralyzed nose . But he croaked , pI26 " You 'll be ssorry , Oscar ! " Oscar spat at the ground ; he was like a snake who hissed spit and poison and had to do it because that was his destiny , mindless and without opinion , but evil from construction . He reached forward and picked the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit on the ground near the log and the ashy camp fire where the smoke was thickening and drifting as the fire died in the hot quiet noontime . The boys had the shifting hope and desire of captives ; they kept looking around ; seeing the sights of their everyday world , places they knew , ways they 'd walked ; and desperately tried to find the way back to them now , and knew that until Oscar chose to let them go , they could not go . They had a fearful faith in Fat still , and kept looking at him with their white little faces ; but he now said nothing , but only blinked at them like an old tired cow , and ruminatively moved his jaw around to relieve the cracking ache it had since the blow . Oscar lay down on the ground and seemed to relax into comfort . He crossed his legs at the ankles , and squirmed and flopped himself on the dirt until he seemed ready to go to sleep . He had his forearms crossed on his forehead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The town simmered in the drowsy noon of spring . Fat was rocking himself a little on his haunches . His resignationwas monstrous ; he was complacent to the cruelest and the foulest treatment , which he confused lazily with fate . Near sixty , he was master of a philosophy that let him be in rags and corruption and without responsibility . And he had done what he could.  |p127The  pause was too full of mystery and foreboding to last . " Look , why ca n't we go !  --  Let us go ! " Oscar luxuriated in this , which he had been waiting for . He pretended to be sleeping , and he drowsily grunted , " Uh ? " , at which the boys both began to make breathless and brave demands to be released . He humorously " awoke " and rolled up on one elbow and side to look at them . " I keep you here because I ca n't be bothered letting you go , " he declared . " I have plans for you . " He smiled . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark . " I can use you . In different ways . " "  --  Oh , sshucks , " said Fat , in a kissing sort of lisp , pouting and scared . " Shutup , Fat . " The boys were pledging with resolve . They could feel it as they sat side by side , touching at shoulder and elbow and knee . They seemed to hum in their bones with the same need and intention , to run when they could ; to run and gasp and fight their way back across the tracks ; they would get up and simplystart to run with bursting hearts and pray they would be free . Oscar squinted at them , and nodded , as if his intuitions were also a power over them . " Anybody who might happen to think they could get away , well , just forget it , " he said . Their hearts sank . They felt like little boys again . Their mouths dried . They fell victims to their own imaginations , and saw thepI28 terrors of slow death by torture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now this is the idea , " said Oscar . He sat up and crossed his legs and began to talk . He said he needed some money . One of the boys would go in and get him some money in town ; he did n't care how ; just get it , that 's all ; the other boy would be kept here until his buddy with the money returned ; then if it seemed like enough money , he 'd let them go , "  --  maybe . " They began to protest . " We have n't got any money , that nickel was all I had , gee , I ca n't get any money ! " Oscar laughed agreeably and took a foot of each boy and began turning it until they rolled to their faces in the earth with compliance to pain . " That 's my answer , " said Oscar . It was Thin who had to stay , and Danny who had to go . Everybody understood that any attempts to bring back the police or anybody 's parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They all listened to the idea that even after he was gone , Oscar did n't want to hear any talk about making complaints ; or else he would have to come back and finish up this job . It was two o'clock by the time Danny was coming up the alley back of the cafe , and he was cold and sticky with sweat and fear . He could n't talk to Irma ; he would begin to cry and fall down to hide it and to stop talking ; and she would come to him and comfort him , and pat his hiccuping sobs into quiet and make him tell her what it was ; and then what would happen to Tom ? And what would become of him ? Oscar would destroy them both , as promised . He wished he 'd beenp129the one to stay behind there in the mild grove of great trees that glistened in the afternoon light and the peace of the tracks , where no trains came till evening . He would have to steal the money . He knew where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tears began to tickle into his eyes as he thought of robbing his mother . He began to consider how she spent her life . He never before had thought it pitiful or difficult to work so hard for the money that went into the cash drawer that had a cupcakepan in it for the change and different coins . He was in the back alley now , looking through a wide crack in the fence . He saw the kitchen screen door . About now Irma would go upstairs for a little while , as she did every afternoon . He would have to get rid of K'ang-Hsui if he was to steal successfully . It was all quiet . He waited . Presently he saw Irma appear passing the kitchen door . She had on her hat and coat . She passed the door again , inside there ; and then he saw her shadowy form retreat up the cafe and go out the door on Central Avenue . She was gone . With a gust of despair in his breath he crossed the back yard and entered the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danny went to the cash drawer and opened it . It was empty of everything but a few pennies and some dimes . The halves and quarters and bills were gone . He knew Irma had got them and gone to the bank . She had turned that way on the walk . Now he really knew panic . There was nothing else he could do.  | But K'ang-Hsui might be in his room . He went to the back yard and the brittle door of the lean-to , and went in . K'ang-Hsui was lying on the bed , on his side , his knees drawn up , his arms folded on his monkey breast , his little bony face grimaced in sleep . " K'ang ! " called Danny . Instantly the little yellow eyes opened and like a lizard 's eyes steadily gazed . The little man 's body did n't move at all , or his lips , only his eyes awoke and gazed . " K'ang-Hsui , I have to talk to you , I have to get  --  listen , K'ang , will you loand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back , honest . " The steady dark little eyes closed again . Motionless . No breathing , no word . He had retired into his lizard 's world . Danny could not reach him . " Listen K'ang ! " He went and shook the little body . It did n't respond with look or movement . Danny was sobbing . He pinched and twisted the Chinaman 's arm , and begged for a loan . He began promising extravagantly . He begged K'ang to take anything he had , or something , he 'd sell anything he had , but he had to get some money . " I 'll sell you my watch , upstairs , that I got for my birthday , it has seven jewels ! " There was a change in K'ang . He was not tense against the shaking . He smacked his dry mouth once and then rolled over on his back . " Sell ? " he said with his eyes still shut.  | " Yes , oh , yes , K'ang ! " " No watch ; no : no want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " " Dog cane . " Danny had to remember . K'ang lay quiet waiting . " Oh , yes , I remember now , Mamma had a cane a long time ago , with a dog head . " " Ya , ya , " said K'ang nodding violently . " But it 's gone !  --  She put it away ! " " Look-find . " " Will you buy it for money ? " " Buy for money . Go-see . " " Oh , I will . Wait here , you wait , I 'll get it , I 'll look everywhere !  --  You got to give me a lot of money for it , I got to have it , about five dollars , I 'll hurry ! " Danny ran out and in the back door and up the stairs to the bedroom above . He was hollow with dread and force towardfinding the dog's-head cane . Upstairs he rummaged in everything he could ; he looked under the bed , and behind the trunk , and in the wardrobe , back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cane . How long ? It was years ago that he was excited and bothered one afternoon about the cane . How should he remembereven what it looked like ? He sat on the edge of the bed and for a little interval , he was blank ; his terror and his fatigue , the exhaustion of his imagination , let him sit there on the big bed witlessly , trembling slightly , and staring at nothing . A sound awoke him . He looked around at the door.  |p132It  was K'ang-Hsui , standing in the doorway grinning . He held a cigar-box against his hollow stomach , and as Danny looked around , he rattled the box which clanked with the sound of coins . K'ang-Hsui licked his mouth and lips with a dry clacking sound , and nodded . His eyes were like black marbles lying in dust , dark and gleaming and sharp , with light . He was excited . His breath caught the air faintly , soundinglike a little dog . " Catchee ? " he asked "  --  I do n't know where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Look-see : " He pointed to the top of the wardrobe , the slat-built lid from which the striped cloth curtains hung . " No I did n't : " Danny ran and placed the straight chair with the brasstackedleather scat against the wall in that corner and climbed up . He found packages on top , ties in yellowed newspaper . There was a long wide cardboard box . There was a long bundle wrapped in an old piece of dark cloth that was silvery with dust . He touched it . He lifted it . This was it . He climbed down and K'ang-Hsui made a take for the wrapped cane , but Danny cried , " No , my money ! " " Come-give. " "  --  We better go downstairs , " whispered Danny , suddenly scared of Irma 's coming home . They went down the stairs and into the yard and lean-to . K'ang-Hsui closed the screen door and the wood door of his room , and the light was mysterious and local , by the little dirty window . He sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lap and reached across it for the cane.  | " Five dollars ! " said Danny with a sinking heart . This was too much money . " Tlee dollar ! " Danny unwrapped the cane . He had forgotten how fine it was , the green eyes of the dog , the long bone jaw carved in a slender open smile of sharp little teeth that felt pleasant on the flesh of the hand , the brown-stained carving of hairs on the dog 's skull . The cane had assumed a terrible importance now , one of that succession of trifles that seemed in childhood to be the very stuff pf life . Danny began to think of what Irma would do . He rememberedwhat might be happening to Tom , over the tracks . " Hurry , K'ang !  --  Do n't you want it ? " " Tlee dollar ten tsent ! " He touched the cane and Danny suddenly wondered why K'ang wanted it ; yes , it was a nice cane , but that was n't very much of anything to own at best . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how in K'ang 's soul that lived beyond time , there was a slow flow of desire and will that drifted between sense and dreams as a river passed through day and night . For seven years or more he had wanted the cane , some matter of private honor , some subtlety of vengeance upon Irma , some crafty delight in the ingenious carving of the bone . They tempted each other and whispered and Danny felt increasinglythe temper of evil and sin within him ; he had stolen and was selling and he would lie afterward ; he felt oddly grown-up ; the world of childhood was gone ; it was a world of whispers , dark ratty corners like this one ; strange powerful cruelties like Oscar 's , and innocent sunlight , that he lived in today . Three dollars and sixty-nine cents was what K'ang finally said . At any further whispered urge , he simply shut his eyes and set his dusty face . He shook his head . He rattled his cigar box . Someone went by whistling in the alley . It reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , all right ! Give me the money ! " He threw the cane on K'ang-Hsui 's lap and had to wait while K'ang unwrapped and rewrapped the stick in its dark cloth and sheathed it clown in his bed on the far edge among the blankets where the slightest stir freed rolls of dust that drifted into the air and settled again . Then he began to count his money . He picked up a dollar bill , and two halves , and gave them over . Then he reached for the bill and took it back , substitutinga silver dollar . He picked up a handful of pennies and counted out nine , saving back the shiny ones and adding to the dirty ones a collection of dimes and nickels , each selected after comparison with the other money in the box . " Oh , hurry , K'ang ! " " K'ang hurry . " It was finally done . Dispirited , Danny took his money and tied it in his handkerchief and put it inside his shirt . Then he went carefully into the yard and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was not seen . And now he was hungry ; he would go back to the kitchen and take a doughnut from the wire cage where they were kept . Yet if he delayed , Tom mightp135suffer . Yet if he went hungry , he might be sick . He went down the alley . He thought , " Perhaps some one will see me , and think maybe I look peculiar , and follow me . " He was certain the terror and guilt on his heart must show on his face . " If they follow me they will see where I am going and they will save Tom too . Then they will kill Oscar and I will make them let Fat go free . " He walked down the street and turned the corner and was on the street leading to the tracks , three blocks from the station.  |p136THE  AIR WAS FLOATING-FULL OF THE SUNNY RELEASESof the day , mild little stirs from the growing leaves and grasses of spring , the acid waft of weeds and the glistening hang of dust above the dirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the air would chill , and shadows and distance would move in the eye with a blue hazy change to night . The nights would still be cold at this time of year . No one saw him . He went alone . His teeth were clenched against the rebellionof his whole self , his heart , his stomach , against his skin as he walked . Now he could see the trees of the tank-grove separate from the buildings lying this side of it . It looked perfectly still , there . What if they were gone ! He began to run a few steps . But he was too tired and hungry to do it long . At last he reached the tracks and started up the near embankment , the low cindery hill . His misery rose into his mouth and he could not help the sore pity of his return to the scene of fright and torture . Sobbing blindly , he stumbledover the tracks , down the other side , and into the grove clearing , where he stood waiting for them to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cried Tom . His face was rivered with dried dusty marks of weeping . But he waved and grinned at Danny . Oscar sat on the log . Fat was asleep against a tree over at the edge of the grove . " You 're just in time , " said Oscar . " Your friend here has been lonesome . He has been crying for you .  --  I ca n't see why .  --  I have n't done anything , have I now : "  |p137He  smiled narrowly at Tom as if to influence him to agreement . " No , you have n't . " " Oh , I have n't , eh , " said Oscar , " you do n't call that anything : well , I 'll give you something to remember ! " " No , no , wait , yes , it was something , it was awful , mister , do n't , do n't , do n't ! " Tom whimpered on his breath and rubbed his left arm where it still hurt from Oscar 's twistings . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Give it to me . " Danny opened his shirt and pulled forth the knotted handkerchief . He held it out . Oscar took it . It was silent and apprehensive while Oscar opened the handkerchief and counted the money . He actually had n't expected so much ; he frowned and spat to hide his satisfaction . It was going to be fun , with this money , when they got to the next town , he and Fat ; only Fat need n't have a dime of it , the old sow belly . He looked sharply up , thinking to dismiss the boys now that they had served him . But he thought , ( and they could see his thought run back of his whitish narrow eyes , the thick mouthed discussion he made silently with himself . They drew together and watched with pinched and staring faces , certain that new horrors were being planned ) . He thought , " If I let them go , they will get somebody after me and this money , that kid stole this money , they 'd find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the night freight . " He looked up and said , " You think that 's enough money , do you ! Well , I 'll show you different !  --  You 're going to work for me. "  | " When can we go ? " " When I 'm good and ready , see ?  --  And if either of you say a word , any time , about me , or what you did today , I 'll come back , and I 'll kick the hell out of you ! Here ? I 'll take the both of you somewhere where nobody evcr 'll hear of you again , and I 'll show you what 's what ! " Fat stirred and awoke a little , and murmured that he 'd like to be allowed to sleep . Oscar swore obscenely at him . Then he set the boys busy washing his socks in the pool in the ditch , where he had discovered them so long ago this morning . He made them wash everything he had in his roll of possessions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them hold his clothes there to dry . The smoke wavered and fanned into their faces and into their clothes . As the dusk began to glimmer across the light their spirits fell sorely , and they felt abandoned and lost . Fat awoke and added twigs and leaves to the fire and shiveredtoward the flame , chilled in his shapeless soul . He hummed a little tune . He seemed to welcome evening and the firelight and sight of the children puttering at their woeful tasks . Oscar sat sprawled hugely against the log , dreaming at the wild party he was going to have on his money when he got somewhere . As his spirits rose , he felt hot-blooded , and his face turned dark with flush and his pale eyes reddened and watered and he told over to himself what he would do when he got a woman again and what he had done in the past and what women had made known to him of himself , and of how that knowledge of his power , his hugeness , his might , was what he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and havep139proved to him over and over again , else he dimly feel himselfdefeated , a creature powerless and wild . " Yai-hee ! " he suddenly yelled , and stirred his rump and his great legs with lust . He jumped up and picked the boys away from the fire where they were waving his two shirts . He knocked their heads together and crushed their arms in his grasps . Then he saw Fat leaning over to gather a few more fagots for the fire , and he made a running skip and kicked him and tumbled him to the ground . And now he was calmer , a little appeased . He came back and told the boys they were to be free after the night freight pulled out . " Fat and I are taking freight tonight . When we 're gone , we 're gone . You can go home then . I 'll be on my way ! " The boys nodded and shivered . They had very little to think about anything . " Yes , sir ! On my way ! And am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town ! Yai-hee ! " Fat came into the firelight that now fluttered in the increasingdark . He was silent and he was hurt ; but he made no protest . He added his scrapings of bark and twig to the fire and sighed heavily , sitting down a little away and alone . The boys did n't stir until the relief engine that would take the night freight out came idling up the track and crossing the horizon in their vision where evening lingered in the lower sky and night already possessed the earth . Then they knew hope . But they could not be sure . Oscar repacked his roll . Fat pulled his possessions out of his pockets and seemed to be counting them , to be sure his packing was all done too.  |p140From  far down the line they could hear the freight train whistle as it drew near town from the other side , coming along the dark evening plain letting blue smoke out against the blue darkness . " When we get the train , you stay here and kick the fire out , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Ssay , why do n't you give him back his knife , Oscar , that kid . . . " said Fat . Oscar broke wind with his lips and tongue . It clearly expressedderision for the idea . " Now what are you going to tell when you get back home , you babes ? " asked Oscar in his whining burlesque of a gentle tone . " Nothing , " said the boys in tired chorus . " And what will happen to you if you do say anything ? " said Oscar , tasting the sugar of menace in his mouth . " You 'll do something to us . " " You 'll come back and hurt us . " Fat sighed , almost in apology for the idiot dramatics of his friend . " That 's right , " Oscar nodded . His big face nodding in the firelight was like some Hallowe'en monster , for it looked largely jovial , unreal , a mask of candle-lighted grinning , with the firelight on it . " Because you never will meet any bigger bozo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can afford to make threats , I can ; because I can back ' em up ! See ? " " Yes sir . " " You better see ! " And even the boys were no longer impressed . This was the monotony of the bully , who never knows when to stop.  |p141They  were tired and sick with hunger and the day-long presence of dread in their bellies . The freight whistled closer . Presently its lime-yellow beam showed far down the track , and they dumbly watched it pull closer and shake its white plumes , cloudy in that dustless air , and stop at the station . Then there was loading , and backing , and breaking and coupling ; the relief engine switched the cars and then backed to its position . " Well , good-by , you babies , " said Oscar . He ambled over to them and they stood up , peering at his face with wrinkled monkey looks of wonder and courage . He grasped their throats and pushed his thumbs on their windpipes . They choked and gagged . They kicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally dropped them , and laughed . Then he said , " Remember , now , " as a warning , and when the engine bell began to roll around , making complete circles and hooping in its carriage , and the steam began to sunder the still night , he turned and said , " Come on , Fat , we got to catch this number , " and just like that , without any more fuss , they walked out of the clearing , and up the track a little way where the engine always began to feel the grade as it led out of town , and there they waited , in the shadow of the cindery embankment . The boys crouched by the fire , staring , to be sure if he came back that they would see him . They could n't believe they were free . But now came the train , as they had watched it several nights ago . It rolled and quivered up the track as if in great bony pain ,  | and it took the grade with a hiss and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue at the darkness , and the chimes of the car wheels rang and spun against the ear ; and the wooden walls of the cars creaked , and the couplers chanted . The train rolled by . The headlight and the steam behind it made a traveling cloud of light way up at the front of the passing train . Against that light , cloudy white and yellow , the boys saw two figures rise and catch at the iron ladders of cars midway in the train . The figures merged with the shadow at once ; but they were gone ; moving away . They were gone . " Well , holy gee ! " said Danny . He sounded sore-throated . They stayed crouching at the fireside . The cars made a cinderywind that blew the smoke awry . The singing , creaking train was almost gone . Here came the caboose . All its windows were warm with the light of lanterns . On the back platform a lantern showed hanging by the hand . It rose in an arc and fell again . Blazing like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the platformat the train 's end , Mr. Dogface , the brakeman , once again stood there intoning his soul into the night , baying with great hound moans the name of the Lord , in a hymn tune . It was like a mysterious visitation of a defied prophet . The boys cowered and shook . They stared after the train as it withdrew into the darkness . In a few seconds they could hear no more of the pious and hollow trumpeting from the old man but they could see his lantern swing with the energy of the music , and it made their hearts come into their mouths for what he had told them and what had come true.  | " Come on ! " whispered Tom . They stood and stamped the fire . The smoke ate into their clothes . Soon it was all dark and quiet . They grasped each other 's hands and climbed over the tracks and down the other side , and went running up the straight street whose corner three blocks over hit Central.  |p144WHEN  DANNY GOT HOME , HE LINGERED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly ten o'clock . Yet there sat Irma , up at the counter , leaning her face on her hand . She was waiting . He could see her there as he approached the door . She looked up when he made a scratching sound in openingthe screen door . She looked around , and stared at him quietly while he went to stand before her . The cafe was empty . It had cold smells of food in it , longfriededibles . " C'mere , " she said . He walked over and felt the surge of pity in his heart for some nameless condition of life that moved him deeply . " Give me m'moncy that you stole , " she said , holding out her hand . Her voice was cold and thin . It told the child , even , of the suffering in pride and betrayal she had gone through . He shook his head and opened his mouth , stricken at her knowledge . " Y'stole my cane , and sold it , and got money for it , and you owe me the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day , and all night , leaving me here t'worry and slave and tear my heart out worrying ! " "  --  I have n't any money , " he said . She energetically reached forward , took him in her arms , shook him , and then turned him down on her knee . Her relief at his home-coming , and her fury with the terms of her life , and with his dishonesty , shook her into rage . She took up a wooden paddle for mixing batter and began to spank him . After a few strokes which he received with gasps , she threwp145down the paddle and pushed him from her knees and coveredher face with her hands and wept . The wood smoke smell of the fire of the day lingered in Danny 's clothes , his corduroy pants , his flannel shirt . He noticed it now , the sharp dead smell . He rubbed his fingers on his face , and nose , as if to make his senses forget . " Oh , Lord , oh , Lord , " sighed Irma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry before . She suddenly became a human being to him . He could see that her grief was over him . She had n't even finished his spanking . He said , " How did you know ? About the cane ?  --  I ca n't tell you ! " he added , in awful respect for Oscar and his threats . There was silence while her weeping abated . Presently she could look up and not into his eyes , but at his person . She talked in hushed and hesitant words . " I came home this afternoon , and went upstairs . You left a chair over by the wardrobe , and I looked on top t'see what you was doing . I saw the cane was missing .  --  K'ang tried to steal it once before , years ago , when you was but a baby .  --  So I went right down and I marched right in , and asked him , and made him give it back , and I paid him what he give you for it .  --  It 's the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She suddenly dropped her face into the crook of her arm , to hide the confusion of grief , memory , and bewilderment in her eyes . He tried to pull her arm away and look at her face ; but she would not let him . She turned away . " It 's all wrong , " she murmured against her sleeve ; " I 'm no kind of a mother to you , and I 've lost m'baby , he 's gone wicked ; I 've tried m'best , for years and years , I kept saying we 're all right , everything 's all right !  --  But it is n't . I 'm tired out , and I 'm lonesome , and I 've let you run , and go bad , and steal , and lie , and worry your mother t'death.  --  I figger just pick up and go . That 's all there is t'do.  --  I been hoping and praying t'go home t'Kansas all these years : I do n't know . . . . " This was so wretched and strange , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of her being a woman : more than his mother ; a creature who perhaps did not exist for his sole convenience , after all . Her vague despair and her mumbled words acquainted him with what went on within her , a thing he never suspected before . He could not make her feel him or look at him ; finally she went upstairs and he followed her , and then a light seemed to strike across her thoughts , and she seized his hands and rubbed them in an agony of emotion ; then raising her hands to the high stained plaster ceiling beneath which she had borne him , she called upon the Lord to listen to a woman who worked so hard and was so tired she never had the time t'go t'church , and to look upon her now , and upon her baby , who stood in a wilderness of sin and misery , Lord ; oh , my soul ... .  |p147IT  'S ALL CHANGED , NOW . I WONDER WHAT YOU'Dthink , but you 're so long gone away I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the little baby you never saw . " I do n't know . " M'boy got in ' trouble someways , Dan , and I do n't know what ' t is , and ca n't make him tell me , and he just goes on , he looks like a clog , or a scared rabbit , or maybe he looks like a pony that 's afraid of being broke . . . . It all happened on that Saturday . He was gone all day . He stole from me , and he lied , I think ;  --  I wish you 's here ! It takes a man t'deal with a growing boy , Dan . " You know how some times just seem to start everything over ? Well , that 's how it is now .  --  Like when you showed up from Athens that day . Lord land alive !  --  Never going to forget it ? " But I always heard Frisbie say no trouble ever came separate , she said you could just sit down to make up your mind more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I raised him , all right . " I cooked and fed him and sent him t'school and watched over him when he was sick and tied up his finger when it got hurt and petted him when he got picked on over to the school and saw he was respectable with clothes and took his bath and kept himself nice and sweet and ready for anything that might come along ! I did all that , Dan . But that 's not it . " No , it needs some one else . It needs some other place . You think I better go back home ? There 's Frisbie and Shide , and the other kids , they 'd be a little older but Danny would n't mind . . . I could be a mother to him there . That 's what 's all wrong . I 'm no kind of a friend to him , take care of his inners ! " Lord , Dan ? I have n't written to Frisbie and Shide for so long ? Well , I 've been ashamed . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll just have to tell them . . . . " I tried and tried to get Danny t'talk fine . .. . " He just wo n't . Did he go stealin ' , reckon ? " Maybe it 's that Tom McBride ! " Trouble , trouble , Dan ! "  |p149IT  WAS A CURIOUS THING , BUT EVERYTHING WENT INTOchange , some of it wrong , as they thought , some of it right ; since that one Saturday in spring . Irma was sure Danny was a bad boy . Danny was sure he was unjustly treated , and he became sullenand secret . He looked in upon his woes until they repaid him by seeming rich and pitiful and inspiring . K'ang-Hsui was feeding a worm in his soul , a miserable hungry worm that ate farther and farther into his pride , so that more and more he sought the sweet , stinking dreams of his pipe . Both Tom and Danny were forbidden by their parents to see the other , each faction regarding the other 's child as the leader who led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in elaborately secret places , after school , and on Saturdays , and compare bitterly what life was doing to them . But one day Tom came with a pugnacious set to his mouth and a scared look in his eyes . He met Danny in the back of the Baptist church , which stood on a sandy corner where four very young trees reared hopefully . They sat down in the shadow of the gray board church with its black tar-paper roof . " Well , I got sick of it , and I told them , " said Tom . " Who : what : " said Dan . " My papa and mamma . I told them what we did that day , and where we were . I told them you had to go home and steal to get me free . " Danny leaped to his feet and danced around and felt strikinglyfrightened.  | " Oh , you should n't , you got us . . . " " What could he do : " demanded Tom . He threw his head back and squinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably wo n't ever come here again . How 'd he find out we told ? " " We told ? you told , " said Dan bitterly . " Well , anyhow , you can go home and tell Mrs. Milford , now . The awful pact had been broken . Dan felt let down . Tom was scornful of any further chickenheartedness . The friends parted with reservations . When he reached home for supper , he was in a somber mood of doubt about everyone . He luxuriated once more in the pleasuresof the martyred , and answered Irma 's incidental questionswith shortness and irritation . It was prayer-meeting night , and after she was through with her supper hour , she went upstairs and dressed herself for going downstreet . When she came clown , she looked for him , but he was gone . But she would pray for him , if she had n't forgotten how , since the days back home when the way to meet people and entertainthem and raise your spirits and theirs together was by meeting them in God , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the champ and oh-yes of the heart givingoutward and making its owner known to God and man . ... That was the old days back in Kansas . Now she would try to bring back what she could to save her boy.  |p151WHEN  SHE GOT HOME HE WAS ALREADY ASLEEP INbed , and she forbore to wake him , but she leaned over him and tried to flood him with the radiation of her happiness . It had come back ! the spirit , and she had sung and closed her eyes and been one again with people . They had been so kind ; the preacher made reference to her in his sermon , seeing her there again , after so many years , how long ? since Danny was a baby ? ten years almost ? ten years that she had spent in desperate labor for the living of her child and herself ; and at first content in his willing babyhood , the sweet abjection of his powerless life , she had sought nothing else of life or spirit . But she could not give all to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the image of her dreams , for he was growing up , and his divergence from her thought of him was a strange and cruel kind of robbery . But tonight she had learned her answer . In the gray board church rising rudely from the sandy corner of the street , she had heard the voices call ; they all called her , they clapped their hands and cried her name with that of the Lord ; their feet began to stamp when she raised her arms and closed her eyes and nodded her head ; they drummed on her soul with every energy they could make ; and she had felt them take her to them , and she had felt how the soul does rise in answer to such a call . While the preacher held out his hands and called " yes , yes , " and the people in the church for the prayer-meeting cried and baaed and whimpered like so many clean white lambs trotting their way through dust and distance to the green pastures , Irma arose and went down to the front and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , my ! " they cried , with their palms up and their eyes shut . She told them a sinner reclaimed was the crown of glory . " Yes , praise ! " " I come home . " " Home with Him ! " " I 'm a poor woman . I work and I slave and I hope for m'baby . " " Amen . " " I worry and I try and I fall down and I get up and keep on a-goin . " Yes , Lord . " " But I know : " " Ye-e-e-cs ! " " I know there is n't anything like the glory of the feeling of the peace of God in your heart and knowin ' He walks with you and guides you and makes you love your man across the street and your woman next door and your baby upstairs in bed all warm and safe , and your friend over in the next county and everybody you ever heard of and all mankind ! " Her voice rose to a singing ringing shout , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried as a response to her strength that poured from her like a deep river , " Yow ! Praise His name ! " What was she doing to them ? All the time she talked , or chanted to them , her heart rose higher and freer , and she felt the tears of gratitude form in her eyes and stay there to make them shine , not fall to make her bleary . She had known this high energy and certainty asp153a younger woman , back home , but she never in her life could have seen herself as she was now , standing in front of a whole churchful of people and leading their hearts to the Lord . But why had n't she the right to have changed in these fifteen years ? What a difference there was between her two selves , in that time ! The girl would have been even a little ashamed of the woman who now exhorted and smote with the blow of the Righteous . And the woman could say with a sad understanding , to the girl , " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect the winding of life 's course until you have followed it ? " At the end of the prayer-meeting , when she was back in her seat again and modestly sitting with eyelids lowered across the excited and stinging liveliness of her eye , the people came to talk to her , and look upon her with surprise and envy . And the preacher came to take her hand and squeeze it , to tell her that she was gifted with tongues and possessed the message of the Spirit , and that she must come often to give it to them . If everything seemed awry with her life and Danny 's , then somehow , here was the answer . She went to sleep upon a sea of vague speculations and possibilities . Some certainty was growing in her , and she felt as if she would never again have doubts , desperate and lonesome , about anything.  |p154DAYS  WENT BY IN SAFETY . Dan was at last able to admit that Tom , by telling his parents about Oscar , had n't turned the furies loose . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends again , and attuned by a certainwild energy to the same gestures , they began to play with the knowledge they 'd learned on the terrible Saturday . As soon as school was recessed , they met in the yard and strolled around waiting for victims ; whom they would seize and torture ; twisting arms and pulling ears upward , and releasingbut not freeing the bewildered children who could not believe that Dan and Tom were so ornery . The two boys said , " Oh , so you 've had enough , hey ? " I 'll show you something to cry about ! " I have plans for you . " It does not suit me to let you go yet. "  --  Maybe this will give you something to remember ! " They were intoxicated with the power of the bully , who conceiveshimself tremendous and great , and so long as the selfimagelasts , can somehow impose it upon others . And they were thickening and lengthening in their bodies . They were shaken and sickened and inflamed by whatever they saw , thought and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a world strangely clear and new to them , and their excitements had no laying in any one occupation . It was not enough that they run and game until they were ready to drop exhausted at twilight on the playfield while the lightp155fell away and the scented evening glistened and darkened in shadow between the small houses of the town ; they had to chase their playmates and hurt them if they could ; they had to break windows and cut the wire that held the joints of school room chairs together ; they had to eat until they were thick with bowels ; bending together they had to exchange obscene words and fluting laughter behind fences and in barns , and so bring alive in hollow craving the feelings and calls of manhood ; they were animals wild in the home pack , running with laughing fangs and mimic fury . All this had its shocking aspect to the adult world of law . Dan was punished at school for making a younger boy cry ; he and Tom were found with a girl their age touching in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overheard planning to hop a freight , ride to the next town , rob the hardware store , and disappear forever . Reports went from school and various other places in town , back to the boys ' parents . Doctor McBride stopped in to see Irma Milford as he was going by one day , and saw her moving around in the cafe . " Those scallawags of ours , " he said . " Beats me , what to do with them . " " What have y'heard ! " demanded Irma , with her face white and her dark eyes firing. "  --  Nothing much new , but I dinno.  --  You knew about that day in the early spring , when they were both away all day and half the night ? " " I could n't get Danny t'tell me one word , he said he could n't and fell t'cryin ' . . . . " " My Tom finally told me . He was scairt to the pink , but he told me.  --  They were both held captive by a couple of tramps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They got hurt and scairt both . " " My land ? " " Your Danny had to come back to town and get some money to give them bums , and then they would n't let the boys go till the train went out that night . Said if they told , they 'd come back and kill them . Said better not mention a word , or they 'd know what they 'd get .... " Irma smiled and shook her head . Her voice got high and breathless , like a child ready to cry . " I could n't make him tell me , " she said . " He got the money , he sold his papa 's cane to my Chinaman here . I bought the cane back . I ai n't had the heart since to even look at Danny , he was lying to me , I thought , and I was so hurt .  --  Now listen to that : he was afraid t'tell me ! " The stout old doctor nodded . " They kept my Tom there while Danny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " "  --  They 're a pair , all right . " " It 's my own fault , " she declared . " Oh , come : " " I should 've believed m'baby . Now he 's gone bad , and runningaround raising cain because his own mother did n't have faith in him , that 's all it is , I been a mighty poor mamma , Doctor ... " " Shucks ! you had a hard job t'do , Mrs. Milford . Now do n't you go gettin ' spoilt , bad enough with those two wild Indians of ours .  --  I keep missing my cigars .  --  Teacher wrote home and said they bully all the smaller children . I whaled ' tar out of Tom for that . Said he was going t'run away . Says he don'tp157have to stand for that kind of treatment . Says he figgered he 'd go get drunk .  --  I got so mad I just grabbed him again and whaled him all over again . " The doctor looked shamedly at his hairy knuckles : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They stared at each other . They were closer to each other than he could have been with his wife , or she with : with whom ? She had no one . But as parents of the boys who grew struggling with their own wills into identity and separateness , they allowed the suffering of their hearts to show to each other ; and in this sentimental exchange , they found a little relief , some strength , and a humorouswisdom about such things as the nuisance of beloved ones , the helplessness of love in the face of youth , and the necessity for high resolves. "  --  Praise God , " murmured Irma while an idea touched her in start . " Now do n't you worry , Mrs. Milford , " said the doctor , regardingher and thinking what a handsome and earnest woman she was . " I 'll always do what I can to help you with Danny .  --  He 's not really bad . Nor is my Tom .  --  Lord , I wish I had no more on my conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She shook her head , refusing his enthusiastic optimism . He went on out , then , and left her to her changing horizon . It was opening up in her thoughts . It lifted her something like a song , and it reclaimed Danny for her , and it came at last after all these years as the answer to what she had wanted to do ever since she came here : and that was , go away.  |p158WHEN  DANNY CAME HOME IN THE DUSK ABOUTsix o'clock and passed through the kitchen area on his way upstairs , he said " Hello , mom , " and Irma ducked her head at him and turned her face away ; she was working between the stove and the customers at the counter , and her hands flew faster at their work , her face darkened with effort and excitement , and the sweat gathered under the delicate hair at her temples . She walked between K'ang-Hsui at his chopping board , his sink , , his stove , to the public , as she always called the eaters ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if anyone else were coming in who would have to be served . But in a time , she had everybody established , and tellingK'ang what to do for a moment , she left the kitchen and trotted upstairs to the room . When she came in and closed the door , her speech sank back into her heart . It was time to talk and offer Danny a new life , and she was powerless . He sat on the bed tying the laces of his best shoes which he had just put on . He whistled gently and did n't look around to her . She was hot and untidy from work , and guilty in her feelingsabout her son . But her resolve was taken , and she came forward to sit beside him and touch his back in a caress with her hand . He squirmed a little from it . " Say , listen , Danny : " He nodded.  | "  --  You know momma well enough t'let her say anything to you she wants to , now do n't you : " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned his round face toward her. "  --  Honey , we 're going away . " " What for : " He was surly . The affection in her tone made his grievances of the past weeks kindle freshly , and in his pity for himself , there was also love and pity for her , so strong , that he did n't want to show it . " ' Cause I been no kind of a mother to you here ! ' Cause I thought you were wicked and a thief and ' cause I did n't know you stole your papa 's cane t'save Tommy McBride from those hoboes !  --  I know it all , ! I know it ai n't s'much by itself , but I know it means something , and I can see this is no way for a boy to live , and I have to see to spend more time with my baby ! I 've failed you ! But no longer ! " She was passionate and enclosed him with her arms . He fought her embrace and felt a hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His furies and cruelties seemed shameful now . " Guess I just had to wait for a real excuse to pick up m'tracks and make for home . Well , when your baby gets to going the wrong road , it do n't seem like you 'd need much more of an excuse to light out and find the right one for him ! " "  --  I 'm all right , mom , " he said ; and then sighed with a catch of breath and fell to her breast sobbing . " Hush , now ; no ten-year-old boy has to cry like that ! " Her hands worried tenderly through his hair , and the articulateness of her instinct told her as no words of hersp16o or his could have how much lonesomeness and fury he had hidden and shown by the terms of his growing ways . She came near crying herself ; but the busy noises downstairs , the cry of K'ang-Hsui 's voice echoing an order , kept her thoughtfulof the work she had to go on with . " Wh-at are we going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't just exactly know . But you can bet your life we 're going t'leave here !  --  I 've wanted to do it ever since you 's born ! " He mastered himself and got sturdily to his feet . He sucked at his running nose and scratched his legs . He smiled at her . " Now you get washed and come down for your supper .  --  Do n't tell anybody yet . Time 'll come . " She nodded at him and went back to the kitchen.  |p161HE  NEXT WEDNESDAY NIGHT FOR PRAYER-MEETINGwas an early summer night , with a white radiance lingering in the western sky , and filtering in through the white frostedglasswindows of the church , where Irma and Danny sat together listening to the Scripture reading . It was the Reverend Marcus up there in the plaster and stained lath stage who read with his heavy voice fluting and trembling with sounds that sometimes were elegant and sometimesforeboding . The twilight faded slowly in the church . Presently a glow of pale golden light washed on the windowfrom the dying day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they arose to sing it each conceiving himself as no longer mean with daily traffick , now at peace with body and soul , and dimly yawning within , anticipating the excitementsof worship that grew out of the people when they gathered , by common donation of spirit , no one man or woman able to give all the divine juice that was needed ; but each responding to some current until it crackled in their souls and struck like lightning out of a cloud and made them shout and stamp , and weep ; groan with the happy burden of the saved , whose name was forgetfulness . On that evening , when the day was darkened finally , and the wiry yellow electric lights were turned on up by the piano and the preacher 's stand , Irma rose to the feeling , the trundling music of hymns , and came down the aisle of brown wooden chairs , nodding her head emphatically and wavering her fists in the air with womanly defiance . She stood before the Reverend Marcus and declared , 161162 MAIN LINE WEST " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time had come for their hearts to be in their mouths , for Irma was always somehow balmy to them in their piety which remained confuseduntil someone ordered it . " I 'm not fit : " she stated . " Oh , Lord , " they moaned . " I 'm not fit t'be a mother . " " Praise ! " " M'child was delivered unto me out of the grandness of God 's heart ! " " Amen ! " " And what I do : " " Sister ? " " I play him false . Oh Lord , have mercy ! " "  --  Mercy ! " She folded her hands before her face and felt them quiver with power and remote tingling as if they were touched with magic , not like her red wrinkled fingers at all . She opened her arms wide then , and embraced the people and took them with her out of the town , out of the church , the sandy streets , the flat plain , the outland world where they lived , and by the bursting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin , and the triumph that attended the meeting of these , she took the people with her into another country . She talked and sang for half an hour . Danny was at first squirming with the strange feeling of it , his mother there in the public eye , carrying on so ; but as he saw how the people moved with her , and dwelled on her words and breathed with her and spoke rhythmically with their bodies in response , he was taken too ; and when sheP163called him to come to her , he arose and without shyness went to her down the brown-wooden-chair aisle , and into her touch . She turned him around , and said to him that he must tell the people of God , God 's children , what he had done that was wicked : for then he would be clean again . " Tell them how you lied in your heart ! " she said , " And why ; how you did it to save a companion from danger ! How your mother would n't leave you be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sin , oh my Lord ! " " The Lamb liveth ! " The bodies were bent and the faces were hidden and the hands quivered shading the eyes ; the voices rang into the bleak rafters of the plaster church , and the sounds of protest , divinity , unworthiness and salvation rose and swam like an invisible watery current over the people and brushed through the strings of the upright piano and made them clamor faintly ; the four hanging electric lamps quivered their filaments in vibration ; the pale windows shuddered now and then when the feet stamped ; the plaster walls hardened the sounds and gave them back : so that the whole building entered into the work of spirit which because it came from people 's dim and tyrannical needs , was divine . " They shall wal-l-k always ! " wailed Mr. Marcus , kneeling on one knee on the little stage behind Irma . From between his fingers he glimpsed the congregation ; he saw that they were moved and rapt as never before . He saw them heave and subside under Irma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her work was cut out for her , if she would but heed . If he were but an unmarried walker in the Way : he thought , how far they two could go together ! He was a tall and many-folded man , his face and neck , P164hands and ' arms showing as deeply rivered by courses of weathered skin as the bark of an old tree , and of the same gray-brown . From his long neck issued his deep nobly-whimperingvoice , rolling with hawks and thunders . His hair was gray and it fell forward like a gaunt boy 's above his gloomy bird 's eyes . He wore a long black coat and a pair of striped working trousers , for he worked a farm near town . Before he could realize how selflessly he was doing it , he was on his feet and waving his long arms like branches at the congregation , across the heads of Irma and Danny . " I say unto ye that this sister must take the staff and go her into the vineyards to labor ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his throat . " Amen ! " cried the people , rising . " Many times now we have listened to her read us the Word and carry us the Message , praise His name ! " " Alleluia ! " " Our hearts is touched . The Holy Spirit moves us when she speaks . " " Say , say . " " It is for them that toil to know the road , and take it ! " " Lord ! " She turned and looked at him . His remote eyes were cloudy with shadow and sharp in points of furious light . He hardly saw her . He was weaving his great black arms together , blowingin the wind of conviction . His knees were bent and he shook his brow locks . In a moment she ceased to be astonished . P165So NOW I KNOW , DAN . " You should 've seen it . There was that church , just packed tight , and I felt the Spirit , so I went down , and I began t'talk , and talked and talked , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there with me , and I showed him to the people . We sang hymns and Danny sang , I heard his voice . It was like your voice singing hymns . I 'll have him to sing hymns wheneverwe hold meeting . " That 's what I 'm up to . " Reverend Marcus says he knows the thing to do . " Says I can make a success of it . " Never saw a woman he says who can get ' em up and make ' em stomp like I can , and mean it , he says . " I 'm going off and travel around holding revival meetings . " I 'll be taking Danny along and we 'll be together all the time .  --  Maybe I 'll get famous and have my own piano-player , and my song soloist , and sometimes they have a trombone choir , land alive , music like that makes your heart come to God so easy you wonder how you never did it before ! "  --  Some day maybe in some city Dan there you 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we afford it , maybe seeing it on some advertisement billboard somewhere , why you 'll walk right in and say to yourself , That 's Irma , the same one , ' and pray ? the people 'll be praying and me leading them , and all things belong to God and to God all things are possible , so in the praying and the people there , you 'll get down on your own knees maybe , and be lifted up then and cry out to God that here you are ! And I will listen , and
