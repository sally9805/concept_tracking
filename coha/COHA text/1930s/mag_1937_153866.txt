There are 29,000,000 U. S. public schoolchildren , but the Speyer School is the only U. S. public school for children mentally gifted. * It was created in Manhattan in February 1936 by the city 's Board of Education and Columbia 's Teachers College , and since that time grey-haired , motherly Professor Leta Stetter Hollingworth has carefully guarded her brood from the adulatory and meddlesome attentions of the public . But this week , entranced by the educational message in a series of unposed candid-camera pictures of her 8 t011-year-old charges taken during the past few months , Professor Hollingworth exhibited the photographs in the college and for the first time gave outsiders a glimpse of what gifted children look like , what they can do . <P> The pictures bore no resemblance to the popular caricature of child prodigies with spectacles and top-heavy craniums . More handsome than the average , Speyer 's merry-faced youngsters were shown running and laughing like the perennially peptic urchins in magazine advertisements . Only their activities were unusual-playing chess , repairing engines , writing poetry , composing music , reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children last year from more than 600 applicants for the Speyer School . Their I.Q.s were from 130 to 200 , the highest recorded rating , indicating potential genius . Chosen from regular New York City classrooms , they came from homes in all economic levels . Nor were they racially or nationally homogeneous . There were two Negro girls from Jamaica and a Negro boy from Haiti . <P> In most cases they were the parents ' only child , a characteristic phenomenon among bright children , says Dr. Hollingworth . Many of them had not struck their parents as remarkable . Nor had they been particularly noted by their teachers , who observed only that , from having skipped grades , they were two or three years younger than their classmates . One 8-year-old lad , who had developed from the age of four a gift for drawing maps , had long been in conflict with his teacher over his habit of drawing them in the classroom after he finished his lessons . Said he : " When the teacher said , ' I must kill this map-drawing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill map-drawing in me . Nobody can . " <P> The Speyer group , aged 7 to 9 and taken from grades 1A to 6B , has worked well together . The children come to school in a building on Columbia 's Morningside Heights from all parts of the city , eat lunch together . Even 8-year-olds travel alone on the subway between home and school . <P> Under selected public-school teachers who must be able to keep their poise when the children flash bits of unfamiliar information on them , the pupils are covering the regular school curriculum ( minus reading , in which they need no instruction ) in one-half the normal time . Thus they are free to spend the rest of the day investigating things the elementary public-school child seldom learns-French , poetry , music appreciation ( via radio ) and are doing independent research into such common aspects of civilization as lighting , transportation . Ninety per cent read newspapers daily , discourse on the Chinese war and the Roosevelt fiscal policy .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
