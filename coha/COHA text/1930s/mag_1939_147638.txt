Bitter was the feud in the all-Negro town of Mound Bayou , Miss. , between Eugene P. Booze , Republican boss , and his sister-in-law Estelle Montgomery . Cause : both claimed ownership of the house in which Booze and his family lived . Eugene Booze apparently won the argument last month : in an altercation over a court order forbidding her to enter the house , Estelle attacked Booze and two white State policemen with a butcher knife , was shot dead . <P> To Eugene Booze , Mound Bayou 's richest citizen , owner of thousands of acres of cotton and timber land , the end of all arguments came last week . After his sister-in-law 's shooting , he was looked on askance by many a citizen of Mound Bayou . One night last week somebody shot him from ambush . John Thomas , Mound Bayou 's marshal , declared the shooting was done by persons unknown . All he knew was that Old Man Booze was dead .                 @ @ @ @
