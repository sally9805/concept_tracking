MILITARY HISTORY OF THE WORLD WAR - Girard Lindsley McEntee - Scribner ( $7.50 ) . <P> THE HISTORY OF MILITARISM-Alfred Vagts-Norton ( $4.75 ) . <P> In war books like Hervey Allen 's Toward The Flame , big battles are presented from the plain soldier 's point of view as little more than explosions of murderous confusion . Captain Liddell Hart 's A History of the World War , caustically analyzing the strategy of opposing generals , gives the impression that battles were almost as confusing to the professionals who planned and directed them . Readers who want to add to their knowledge of what happened at the Somme , the Marne , Cambrai , St. Mihiel , Mons-and why it happened as it did-can get some insight into the confusion from two recent volumes that review the history of the World War-one from a pacifist 's , the other from a professional soldier 's point of view-will find that it looks almost equally forbidding in both . <P> Colonel McEntee 's Military History of the World War is a huge volume of 583 large pages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battles . Its main contribution is its pictorial demonstrations of both original plans for battles and step-by-step diagrams of the way they worked out . Thus Colonel McEntee exhaustively describes the original von Schlieffen Plan that called for invasion of Belgium , uses nine maps to show what happened when the Marne was reached and changes in the Plan had weakened the German forces . Relying heavily on official reports . Colonel McEntee writes uncritically , only occasionally pinning responsibility for defeats on backbiting officers , interfering politicians . <P> According to Dr. Alfred Vagts 's The History of Militarism , " much of military history is misleading as a result of the authors ' deliberate intentions , " most of the rest so stereotyped it is useless in determining what happened in any war . The confusion of battle is perpetuated because generals edit the official reports , and " word their orders in such an oracular fashion that victory , if it comes , can be traced to them , while failure , if it befalls , " can be blamed on somebody else . To make sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a - page volume that is less a history than a monumental , smoothly-composed , historical essay on the nature of the military mind .
