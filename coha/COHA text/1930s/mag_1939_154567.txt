In 1933 wee Willie Woodin packed up his guitar and went to Washington to become Secretary of the Treasury of a brand New Deal . On leaving he turned over the presidency of his American Car &; Foundry Co. ( second largest U. S. railroad car maker ) to a little white-haired lawyer , Charles J. Hardy , who had been the company 's General Counsel . Charlie Hardy has been head of American Car &; Foundry ever since . <P> About the same time that twinkle-eyed Mr. Woodin left , Seor Oscar Benjamin Cintas , a director of the company and head of its Latin American subsidiaries , also went to the capital to take an official job : Cuban Ambassador to the U. S. Sometimes Charlie Hardy went down to see his friend Oscar and enjoyed the excellent Bacardi cocktails at the Cuban Embassy . After almost a year in Washington Oscar gave up his embassy and returned to the Latin American companies . <P> At one end of the directors ' table in the big board room of Jersey City 's First National Bank one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long Cuban cigarette between his slim fingers , a sleekly rolled umbrella between his well-tailored knees . Across the table , and nervous under Oscar Cintas ' blazing black eyes , sat gnome-like Charlie Hardy . Jampacked in the room were some 125 A. C. F. stockholders , come to the annual meeting to see Hardy and Cintas , no longer friends , have it out . <P> They had got along fine until last sum mer when Oscar Cintas finally blew up over what he regarded as a failure by Car &; Foundry to go after Latin American business . He resigned as director and president of the company 's Argentine , Brazilian and Cuban equipment subsidiaries . Last month , three weeks before A. C. F. reported a $1,662,692 deficit for the fiscal year , Oscar Cintas , from his ritzy suite in Manhattan 's Ritz-Carlton , sent a bitter letter to stockholders charging that Car &; Foundry 's directors were on record for only minuscule blocks of stock , while he , Oscar Cintas , was the largest individual stockholder in the company . <P> Back cracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgruntled , discharged employe dealing in " misstatements and half statements . " Back cracked Oscar Cintas with the charge that the Hardy law firm ( Hardy , Stancliffe &; Hardy ) was making a good thing out of Car &; Foundry . ( The company paid the firm $12,825 in legal fees for the last fiscal year . ) <P> In the Jersey City board room last week the play reached its climax before the curtain had well risen . At the first motion ( to dispense with the reading of the minutes ) Mr. Hardy sent his tellers among the stockholders to collect ballots on the motion . When all were in , Charlie Hardy , without so much as a glance at Oscar Cintas , rasped that the chair represented a majority of the stock , announced the minutes would not be read .
