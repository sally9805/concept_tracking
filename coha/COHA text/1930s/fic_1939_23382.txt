TRAUMEREI A STORY BY CHARLES COOKE M ARJORIE was a hundred yards from the hill , but she saw him . Her heart seemed to stop beating . It was the final excitement , climaxing all the other things that made this an incredible day . Walking deeper into Central Park along the snowy path in the bright afternoon sunshine , she was so happy that she was solemn . She was a little frightened too ; for did n't every step bring her nearer that unmistakable green-leather helmet ? She knew that by every rule of feminine behavior she ought to turn and walk in any direction but the one she was taking . But all their other encounters had been mere glimpses while going up or down the brownstone steps . And always he had been with his parents or she had been with hers . He was n't alone even now . But this time his companion was another boy , so small that he was negligible . This was her first real chance and she intended to take it . At least she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park specifically to look for him . After Mummie called up the Steinway office and they told her the piano would be delivered " sometime this afternoon , " Marjorie had needed to get out of the apartment , to kill time . And perhaps it would be there when she got back ! Perhaps that wonder of wonders would be there and she could reverently touch its case and sit before it and play , in its celestial tones , the opening measures which she had so laboriously mastered of Schumann 's " Trlumerei . " So she had asked Mummie if she could take a walk and Mummie had said she could , since it was such a lovely Christmas Day . She had started up Central Park West , but when she saw the children sliding down the hill on their sleds she had turned into the glittering , snow-mantled Park itself . And then she saw him . She was thankful from her soul that she looked her best in her patent-leather pumps , plaid knee-length stockings , pleated plaid skirt , scarlet jacket , and black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention her black muff into which her fists were smartly dug as she walked through the icy air , pigtails tossing , the color high in her brunette cheeks . Though she had never seen him until she moved to New York with Mummie and Daddy two weeks ago , he had filled her waking hours and her dreams ever since . She knew real love when it entered her heart  --  love that was deathless , that was too marvellous even to think about without catching your breath . Not that she wore her heart on her sleeve or was easily carried away : twice before , back home in Utica , she had thought briefly that she was in love . But this boy with walnut hair , blue eyes , chin dimple , and placid , mature face , always wearing a green-leather windbreaker and a green-leather aviator 's helmet  --  this boy was a young god . At last it was the real thing ; it was forever . . . Marjorie was eleven years old . She was quite near the hill now and she forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its way , that Mr. Tirtoff was coming to call to-night , and that her music lessons were soon to begin  --  her first real lessons , because Professor Spiker did n't count beside the great Mr. Tirtoff . She forgot everything . It was a festive hill . Children of all sizes on sleds of all kinds were sliding down it , gleeful with the exhilaration of speed , Christmas afternoon , sunshine , and that rare phenomenon in New York ? a perfect snowfall . When Marjorie reached the top of the hill he was at the bottom . She leaned against a black tree-trunk and her tension relaxed as she realized that she unquestionably made a very pretty picture . She stamped the snowcaps off her shoes and looked casually round as the green windbreaker and helmet started back up . Her studied unconcern became elaborate , for he was nearly all the way up now , his little companion running beside him . They halted at the crest . They were only a few feet from her , but he did not see her . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend to sit down and place his feet on the center of the steering-bar . Then he sat down behind him , spreading his legs to put a snow-wet shoe on each end of the bar . Marjorie had been watching with shameless directness , ready to turn her eyes away . But he did not look . As he dug a mittened hand into the snow and turned his head toward her , she deliberately shifted her position against the tree . The movement caught his eye and lie looked . She did not turn away . She returned his gaze helplessly , her great emotion justifying what , but for their past of wordless fleeting glances , would have been inexcusable boldness . Her whole soul shone in her timid half-smile that widened as the shattering second passed ; her heart sang with the answering hint of a smile that subtly transfigured his mouth . As he shot down the hill she raised her muff and pressed it against her mouth and nose , with dancing eyes watching him diminish . She was still looking at him over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed as though he was not going to do what she was praying for . " Want to go down ? " he said . " Yes . . . love to . " Marjorie sat down as she had seen the little boy do and the young god sat behind her and they flew down the snow , his green-leather arms steadying her in unbelievable intimacy . As they turned to walk up she waited for him to look at her . He did n't . " Thank you , " she said at last . " That was lots of fun . " " What 's your name ? " he said . " Marjorie Bannerman . " " I knew it was Bannerman . I saw it on the mail-box . But I did n't know what your first name was . " " It 's Marjorie . " More than ever , Marjorie wanted him to look at her ; she wanted to show him how much it meant to her that he had looked at the mail-box . He trudged along absorbed . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That was just right , since she was eleven . And he was a little taller . And he had blond hair , while hers was black . Everything about them , as a couple , was right . " What 's your name ? " she said . " Peter Horn . " They were more than half-way up and suddenly she knew why she felt so drained . He was not really interested , for all her finery and her open worship . He had responded to her look , but now he was detached  --  cold as the December air . He was preoccupied with a hero 's thoughts and she had no part in them . She tumbled into despair . The Park mocked her with its glory . " What are you thinking about ? " she said . " Nothing . " His brow was furrowed . He was obviously thinking about something that was very important to him . She climbed in hurt silence . He relented . " I 'm thinking about my new model airplane Pops gave me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it 's very complex . " He warmed to his subject . " It 's thirty inches long . Got a varnished propeller and wooden wheels and a nose plug and struts and ailerons and longerons and templates and an instrument-board and cellophane windows . A big blueprint and two jars of liquid cement came with it . " His eyes were at last turned on her , but they glowed with the self-centered zeal of the fanatic . " My ! " she said . " Can you put all that together ? " " Sure . I 'm going to be an aviator . " So that was why he always wore the helmet . It was symbolic of the noble destiny that awaited him . " On a big transport plane ? Daddy says those pilots are marvellous . They study seven years to . . . " " That 's sissy work . I 'm going to be a test pilot . " She sighed . Her love was hopeless . How could she dream of attracting him when his spirit scaled such heights ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , part from him somehow , and slink home . As they reached the top he spoke again . " What did you get for Christmas ? " His tone was impersonal , his question obviously designed only to ease the embarrassment of leave-taking . But she brightened . " I got a Steinway piano ! That is , I 'm going to . It 's coming this afternoon . " The change in his expression was astonishing . He was almost as interested as he had been in his plane . " Piano ? " he said . " Do you play the piano ? " His eyes were wonderfully blue . " Yes . I 'm going to play in concerts when I 'm old enough . " She colored , for that was a lie , though Professor Spiker had often said she would certainly play very well by the time she was grown up . His changed manner had betrayed her into saying that ; and she let it stand . " I never heard you play , " he said . " Well , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But how could you hear me anyway ? " " You 're right above us , are n't you ? We hear everything that 's any loud at all . " She raised her muff in alarm . " Do you hear when .. . I mean when Mummie and Daddy . . ? " He laughed . " ' I will not be dominated by a woman ! ' " he mimicked . She could feel herself blushing again . This was too awful ! Apparently in New York brownstone houses you could hear the people above you but not the people below you . They 'd never heard a sound from the Horns . She 'd have to tell Mummie and Daddy about this and maybe they 'd keep their voices down . Peter 's little companion was eager for another ride , but Peter , still looking at her with undiminished interest , said : " How much do you play ? " " I 've studied two whole years . I can play the ' Traumerei . ' " She avoided his eyes as she said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say it that way  --  as though she could play all of " Triumerei " and play it well . But , after all , she could play the first eight measures of it without a single wrong note . " I like that piece , " he said . He whistled a few notes of it and she nodded . " I like music , " he said . " Pops got us a new radio with a victrola in it for Christmas , but it needs a transformer to change D.C. current into A.C. and it has n't come yet . " Her brain reeled with D.C. , A.C. , transformers , and his feeling for music which seemed to be as intense as her own . He was indeed a god . " Can you really play it ? " be said . " Of course or I would n't say so . " She tossed her head , pursing her lips at him for doubting her . The ground she had gained was too precious to lose ; she was already less meek and submissive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not exaggerating , her musical accomplishments . She knew the only bond by which she held him was music . " Well , " he said . " The piano is coming to-day ? " " It may be there when I get back . " " Are you going to play on it to-day ? " " Possibly . I 'll see how I feel . I 'd better go along now and see if it 's come . Thanks again for the ride . " " Wait a minute . Are you coming out to-morrow morning ? " " Possibly . " " I might be out front on the steps . I 'm going to work all evening to-night on my model . If it 's done I might show it to you . " " Oh , would you ? About . . . what time ? " " Maybe around half-past ten . " She walked sedately until she was out of sight of the hill . Then she ran all the way home . The Bannerman living room that evening was warm and bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the piano , waiting for the doorbell to ring . An iridescent happiness , from a source deeper than the Steinway or Mr. Tirtoff 's impending visit , filled her brain . It seemed to her that though she was sitting here she was really downstairs in the glamorous unknown apartment , watching Peter with adoring eyes as his fingers masterfully assembled his plane . She had a " date " with him ! It was unbelievable , but true , true , true ! The bell rang and their guest came up the stairs . The door closed behind Anton Tirtoff , who brought with him , in the folds of his expensive , fur-collared coat , the snowy smell of the winter night . " There ! There it is ! " he cried . " I am so glad when you tell me on the ' phone you have ordered new Steinway , Dr. Bannerman ! I am so glad it already comes ! " He rubbed his hands with uncontrollable anticipation . " It calls me . But my fingers are solid . Let us talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , the noble instrument , the beloved shape of it ! The pedals peep out of their velvet caings like little brass feet , no ? " He was looking at Marjorie . " So our young lady here is musician , yes ? " He beamed . " New piano then is to her the event of the lifetime ? " " Ye-e-s , " Mrs. Bannerman said , doubtfully . " We thought she 'd run to it the minute it came , but she has n't touched it . " " You ought to be the first to play it , " Dr. Bannerman said , " to get it off to a good start . Marjorie is n't very far along with her piano work , but she eats , drinks , and sleeps music . " He looked at his daughter . " She 's in a fog to-day , " he said , affectionately . " Too much Christmas , I guess , " Mrs. Bannerman said . Marjorie smiled tolerantly. it was rather pleasant baffling your parents . how could they , down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the heights ? She was a puzzle to herself though , to be honest about it . What had happened to her urge to play the beginning of " Traumerei " in the Steinway 's tones of unearthly beauty ? " So you want our young lady to take with me some lessons ? I do not often teach children , but friends of Professor Spiker are friends of mine . I am only too glad to try it and see how we pro ess . What can she . . . ? " " She had just begun ' Traumerei ' with Professor Spiker when we left Utica , " Mrs. Bannerman said , " and it was coming along very nicely . " " So ? Traumerei ? Ah , yes . " Anton Tirtoff turned to Marjorie . " Did you know that is in a suite ? Only one fine piece in a collection of thirteen fine pieces ? No ? " He wiggled all his fingers with astonishing rapidity , smiled , and got up . " I function once more . will play you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scenes , ' you call in English . You like to hear ? " He seated himself with relish on the bench and with both hands played a flowing , silvery chromatic run in double-thirds from deep bass to high treble . Marjorie jumped out of her chair and ran to the piano . " Please , please do that again ! " " Let Mr. Tirtoff play what he wants to , " Mrs. Bannerman said , reprovingly , but the pianist delightedly played the run from the treble down to the bass , then in contrary motion , and finally the way he had first played it , but fortissimo . He played trills with his right hand , his fingers machine-perfect , like swift little alternating hammers . Then he crashed out a series of bravura arpeggios and octaves that made the windows rattle . He paused and , still smiling , mopped his forehead with his handkerchief . He had been working hard . He had been showing off  --  and Marjorie knew it . She did n't care . The massive , tremendous sounds still filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never dreamed that fingers could be so agile and so strong , The whole subject of piano-playing was fifty-fold more exciting and important than it had been before . She leaned on the piano , speechless , looking at this superman , her eyes filled with amazement and with overwhelming gratitude . She loved him for what he had just done . She could almost see Peter , in the room below , set down his airplane and , looking up in awe toward this stupendous music , listen , visualizing her , not Mr. Tirtoff , at the keyboard , marveling at her miraculous hands . " Sit down , Mudge , " Dr. Bannerman said . " Mr. Tirtoff does n't want you gawking at him while he plays . " " Let her stay . She has music in the blood , one can sec . A first-water Steinway you have here , young lady  --  such liquid tone ! You will want to practice all day , yes ? " His face sobered as he deliberately changed his mood . " Now the ' Kinderscenen ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the best  --  oh , among the very best of Schumann . " He began . At first Marjorie was disappointed . It sounded so childish after that harmonious thunder . It improved suddenly however . He shouted " HascheMann ! " screwing up his mouth and eyes as he plunged into a rushing , rollicking passage . She could just see childrenrunning in mad circles ; it was exhilarating and , best of all , loud . It was over all too soon . He played on . Then he paused . " Now your ' Tatimerei , ' young friend . We will make it our first piece , yes ? And we will learn it right . Must be slow , mind  --  real lento . And pretend you never heard it murdered in a ' cello arrangement . Is hackneyed now , yes . But is immortal music just the same . Schumann meant it when he called it Traumerei , ' so make like a true dream , like a wonderful reverie . " " I never saw Mudge so absorbed , " Mrs. Bannerman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full . An hour later Marjorie lay in bed . Her mother opened the window wide and went out , closing the door . Music had torn Marjorie away from her secret , but it was back with her now , more precious than ever . She held to-morrow at ten-thirty tightly in her arms . What a day it had been ! Her first lesson with Mr. Tirtoff was to be next week . Oh , how she was going to work ! He had said that in three or four years she would be able to play the whole suite , including " HascheMann . " Think of that ! And what a day to-morrow was going to bet Life was all magic as she burrowed her cheek into the pillow . She opened the vestibule door and stepped out into the frosty , sunny morn ing . He was waiting at the bottom of the steps , holding a model of an airplane . She descended slowly , with complete composure and regal bearing , toward her great moment . He was wearing his green-leather windbreaker and helmet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carried her smart black muff . She leaned easily against the brownstone railing , accepting the tribute of his round-eyed gaze . The Steinway 's music was an even greater glory now than it had been last night . He was looking at her as though he had never seen her before . He had lost so much self-assurance that he seemed to her like a different personas different from his yesterday 's self as she was from hers . His pale face and chin-dimple and blue eyes did not master her to-day ; she was master of them , and it was the headiest sensation she had ever known . " I worked till after ten last night to get it done so I could show you , " he said , holding the model out . " Is n't it the best airplane you ever saw ? " he said . " It 's very nice , " Marjorie said . " It 'll fly a thousand feet ! After I fix this wing strut , I mean . I 'd fly it for you right now but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  there . " He was beside her and she was looking where he pointed . " Oh , yes , " she said . He was trying to impress her with his model , as though he needed to show her , who was prodigiously and excitingly skilled , that he too was prodigiously and excitingly skilled . She soared on her new sense of power . She had taken one hand out of her muff to hold a wing-tip politely . Unhurriedly , she put her hand back in her muff , because she saw that he had been looking with curiosity and respect at her fingers . But apparently he was not going to come all the way down from his mountain-peak to kneel at her feet ; apparently he was going to retain some remnant of his lost superiority ; apparently he was not going to say anything about last night . She watched an automobile speed silently past them on the dazzling , snow-matted street . Suddenly she said : " Did you know TrNumerei ' is in a suite ? " " In a what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scenes . ' There are thirteen pieces in the suite and it 's only one of them . " She smiled at him . She knew that , though a test pilot 's colossal career was to be his , he was proud to know her now . She was enveloped in a golden haze of flawless happiness . A window flew up . " Mudge dear , " her mother 's voice called . " Time for your practice . " " All right , Mummie , " Marjorie answered . She turned to Peter . " See you later , " she said , starting up the steps . He started up too . " You 're going to practice ? " he said . " Well , I 've got to go in and fix this wing . " Her hands instantly went cold in her muff . The present had been so overwhelming that there had been no future . And now , just as she had to begin her practicing , he was going in too , and would hear it all . She had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorious , iridescent dream was collapsing . But maybe they 'd have their radio on and  --  no , she remembered he 'd told her that it was n't working until some piece of machinery came . In her consternation she clutched at a straw  --  if he did n't come in he would n't hear . " Why do n't you fly it anyway ? " " Oh , no . It would break all to pieces . I 've got to fix it first . " " How . . . how long will it take you ? " " Probably a couple of hours . I do n't mind . I like to work on my plane better than anything . " They parted in the hall . Marjorie walked slowly up the stairs , dread walking with her . " Now then , " Mrs. Bannerman said , spreading out on the ebony music-rack Marjorie 's well-thumbed little copy of " Traumerei . " " Now for an hour of work on Mudge 's own piano . " Marjorie looked at the keys that were so shinily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , familiar keys of the old upright they had left in Utica . This keyboard looked to her like a row of fierce teeth . " Why not do what you know of it , then we 'll go on to a little of the new part ? " Mrs. Bannerman said . Marjorie obediently began . The piano 's booming voice made her flinch ; the stiff , slippery keys were hostile . Could this be the same piano that Mr. Tirtoff had played so easily ? A lump began to grow in her throat . But habit carried her through the first eight measures with only a smudged note here and there . She stopped . " That was quite nice , " Mrs. Bannerman said , " Do n't you just love your new piano ? " Marjorie looked down at her hands . " I declare , Mudge , you 've acted so strangely about the piano ! You did n't want to play it last night , but we thought you were all right later when you were so thrilled about Mr. Tirtoff and your lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you do n't seem to want to practice . To-day , of all times ! " Mrs. Bannerman was more hurt than she wanted her daughter to see . " Well , let 's go on , " she said after a pause . " We 'll only take two measures . " She waited . " Come on , Mudge ! What 's the matter with you to-day ? " Marjorie looked at her mother , who had always understood everything , who had always welcomed outpourings of any real troubles , who had always loved to comfort you by untangling the snarls in your life . But Mummie , for once , would n't know what on earth you were talking about . It was impossible , just impossible , to transfer the complicated situation intact from your mind to hers . " Let 's do the first part again , " Marjorie said , miserably . Mrs. Bannerman was on the verge of anger . " For heaven 's sake , why ? " she said . " That wo n't get us anywhere . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't be giving up this hour at all , but I want to help you get ready for Mr. Tirtoff . Just the two measures , very slowly . " Marjorie placed her trembling fingers on the keys . The first measure went well because it was just like the opening of the piece . But the next one was a maze of those awful flats and sharps . She tried with all her brain to comprehend them , but they made only partial sense . Her cold , stumbling fingers played softly , touching some keys so lightly that they did not sound . " Marjorie , are you afraid of this piano ? We have to hear the notes , do n't we ? " Marjorie tried again , but in the second measure she again played softly , her halting child 's touch dissipating the last vestige of the golden haze that had enveloped her ten minutes before and was now a cloud of black despair . To her mother 's absolute bewilderment , she stopped and , dropping her face into her hands , burst into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
