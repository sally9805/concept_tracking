As 600 head of fractious livestock and 200 cowboys and cowgirls clattered into New York 's Madison Square Garden last week for the 12th annual World 's Championship Rodeo , one important face was missing , the fat , wrinkled features of Promoter William T. Johnson . After eight years in his highly speculative business . Promoter Johnson had sold his rodeo livestock , equipment and Garden contracts , ( New York and Boston ) , retired to devote all his time to his three great ranches in Texas . His former roaring , rollicking exhibition , however , went right on last week to shatter last year 's attendance records . <P> The World 's Championship Rodeo has no world 's championships to offer in calf-roping , steer-wrestling , bronco-riding or any other spectacular event of a rodeo . Nearest approach to such championships are the point scores compiled annually by the Rodeo Association of America ( which the Garden rodeos joined last year ) on the basis of some 50 rodeos , including the famed contests at Cheyenne , Pendleton , Calgary and Salinas . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drawing more first-rate performers than any single Western rodeo . <P> So last week most of the top-flight cowboys of the North American rodeo circuit circulated around Broadway movie theatres and bars , wearing at the Garden 's special behest the widest hats and brightest shirts they could buy . As contestants in what is one of the most unprofitable as well as one of the riskiest of sports , rodeo cowboys average about $3,000 a year in prize money , spend most of it on traveling expenses , clothes , entry fees , hospital bills . Few , therefore , can afford to pass up the Madison Square Garden rodeo , which offers the season 's biggest total prize money ( $38,000 ) , augmented this year by the entry fees in all events . <P> Without Colonel Johnson , the opening parade up Broadway was led last week by the new impresarios : his rangy , longtime arena director , Everett Colburn , and boyish Harry Knight , a onetime bronco-rider and son-in-law of Cowboy Tom Mix . A third , also in the parade , was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cash to buy Promoter Johnson 's string of broncos , steers and wild cows , and to send " Gorilla " Mike Hastings scouring the West for more . Scout Hastings was visibly pleased last week with one of his most celebrated finds , a bucking horse named Hell 's Angel . So vicious that in five years no one has ridden him the prescribed ten seconds at the garden , Hell 's Angel on opening night Bought about the downfall of one Fritz 1 ruan only a yard out of the chute.
