" Now my ideal philosophy is one which admits what I have just briefly sketched to be the basis of human nature . I practise it constructively . For instance , my business is to distribute fine groceries and minor edible luxuries in and about Havana . But I do not regard this as an end .

" As for the peccadillo of the soul I leave that to the church ; heroics to the military . I am fortunate , for I have no desire for fame . It appears to me to be a form of egoistic insanity .

" Unconsciously he patted his paunch again . There did not seem to he any ready reply to make to this . Anthony was surprised to find that while they were speaking both Brother Francois and Carlo sounded equally convincing . " You seem very sure of yourself , Carlo , " he said half aloud at last . " I am , " said Carlo , " you see I have tried it out . " On the basis of experience Anthony felt at a disadvantage . " At least I am engaged in one very practical thing , " he said finally . " I am determined whatever comes to collect that debt from Gallego . It is not only the money , but . . . " " Good ! And it may take you far , " interrupted Cibo . " While you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest dispositionof your own affairs . They might take you to Africa . How would you like that ? " " Carlo , are you trying to ship me off like Brother Francois ?

Most of Gallego 's assets are now on the Rio Pongo . That is the only kind of conversion I had in mind . In any event we shall have to see the captain-general  --  tomorrow , perhaps . I will tell you about it then . It is , to be frank , a difficult mess . But no more of it now . " It is late . Have your supper in your own room tonight .

" There is for example  --  Cheecha . " " Not tonight I think , Carlo , " said Anthony . He had hesitated a little . " Ha , not tonight , not tonight ! Adios then , senor , at least I may wish you pleasant dreams . " It was hard to tell whether Carlo 's tone was mocking or really as regretful as it seemed . Anthony went to his room , bathed , and lay down . Cheecha brought the supper . After he had eaten she rolled the little wagon into the corridor . Then she came back again . " Is there anything else I can do for you , senor ? " she asked . He looked at her . She stood huddled back against the wall a little , but her intonation had been both submissive and hopeful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giggled . Finally he shook his head . " Adios , Cheecha. "  | " Adios , senor , " she replied , her shoulders drooping disconsolately as she wheeled the empty dishes down the hall . It was very hot . The mosquitoes droned outside the net . The day had excited him more than he thought . Although he was tired it was hard to relax . In what seemed to be a state of wakefulness rather than sleep he had a silly dream . Captain Jorham 's bottle of wine had fallen on his own madonna and smashed it . He felt unreasonably sorrowful . It seemed irreparable . He thought he got up and went to his chest to make sure . It was very hard to get the covers off the statue . Faith had put them on . They were tied up in intricate knots . Finally he came to the madonna herself . Yes , there she was . She was holding the child out to him , extending it through the folds of the cloth . The child emerged alive and came toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light about it . But suddenly it was not the child . It was just Brother Francois with the light of the vine on his face . He was trying to say something and was pointing out a road they were both to travel together . Just then Father Trajan rushed in and bawled out , " A miracle , a miracle has occurred ! " Father Trajan thrust his hands into the chest and pulled out the madonna proudly . It was broken and streaming with wine . The statue could never be put togetheragain . It was full of pieces of Captain Jorham 's wine bottle . " It is your miracle that has done this , " shouted Anthony . He was furious at Father Trajan . Brother Francois was standing by looking very sad at all this . His face was full of pity . Then Anthony saw that Carlo Cibo was sitting on the chest laughing . " What difference does it make ? " he asked . He was smoking a cigar . " Brother Francois will mend it , " Anthony heard himself exclaim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I can not help you , " said the monk and pointed to Cibo . " He is sending me away . " Nevertheless , Cibo and the monk began to struggle for the madonna . She began to come apart in fragments . An overwhelming sorrow seized Anthony and he began to weep like a child . Then , as is the way with dreams , the whole nature of the affair changed without apparent cause while remaining to itself perfectly rational . The fragments of the madonna now scattered on the floor coalesced and became Mrs. Jorham 's doll . Cibo and Brother Francois now seemed to be fighting over nothing important at all . A feeling of great relief swept over Anthony . The room appeared to be flooded suddenly with sunshine . Cibo and he and the monk were now on the deck o f the Wannpanoag . It was dawn and he could hear the noise of cock/crow , a joyous sound . " It is only a doll , " he shouted . " Give it to Philadelphia and let him burn it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cigar . " Only a doll ? " said Cibo . " You are mistaken ! " Instantly darkness returned . The cock-crow was nearer now but frightfully ominous . Anthony was plunged into the full terror of a nightmare . He struggled to his feet to get away . But he was hack in the room again . Cibo and the terrible doll were there , too . " Look , " said Cibo pointing with the glowing end of his cigar . He could not help but look . The doll had become much larger . She was towering against the wall , growing . In the deep gloom of the place she became gigantic . Only the end of Cibo 's cigar showed now . It was going out . Completedarkness descended except where the doll stood in a kind of foul light . The doll was turning into Cheecha , huge , naked , with legs spread apart and rolling her stomach . " Bury your trouble , " shouted Cibo , " bury it deep ! " He pushed Anthony by the arm toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthony could smell her sweat now . He gave a stifled cry and struggled . It was too much to stand . It was loathing and terror unmitigated . He writhed , and awoke suddenly to find himself kneeling on his own sea-chest and leaning half-way out of the barred window into the patio . All the roosters of Regla were crowing . It was the hour of false ( lawn . Under the window some shrub in the patio emitted a sickeninglysweet , musky scent . His arm was caught in the iron grille work . If it had not been for that he would have plunged out in his sleep into the garden below . Even that fall he thought would have been a relief from the dream . But he drew back at last cold and shuddering . He cursed himself , and all the rest of them . The dream had been so vivid that he felt sure he had seen the actors in it as they really were . It was some time before he could shake it off . He lit a candle , drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally the mosquitoes drove him back to bed again , this time to an exhausted and dreamless slumber.  |p454HONOUR  AMONG THIEVES WITH any important business in view the man Cibo shook off his lethargy completely and exhibited a native energy against which no climate could prevail . While it took several bowls of black coffee to clear Anthony 's head of the wraiths of the night before , Carlo rattled on gayly at breakfast and exhibited triumphantly a mason 's trowel and some pieces of a broken bottle . " How did you get them ? " exclaimed Anthony . The shards of broken glass seemed to have been retrieved from his dream . " A few piastres in the right place also work miracles , " replied Cibo , " as you will soon find , my boy , when you come to do business in Havana . But in your case it may take more than a few . By the way , we go to . the intendant 's this morning and perhaps to the Gallegos ' later . You should call first for the clothes for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let 's be off while it 's still early and cool . No business is done here after eleven o'clock . " They crossed the harbour swiftly . Cibo kept a smart cutter rowed by four blacks dressed in bright , cotton drawers . There was a polishedcopper strake around the boat under its brass gunwale . They both lolled back in cane seats in the stern in considerable style . " This kind of thing pays here , " explained Cibo . " Appearances count as much with Spaniards as with the Chinese . Even when board a foreign man-o ' - war I get attention . Mere bumboats are always told to sheer off by the officer of the deck . But all this , and my sash , look official . I have even been piped up the side . Why not have your man outfitted as an officer 's servant ? I see you have brought him , along . Juan , " said Cibo sharply , " sit up ! Stop dragging your hands over the side . Your master is a rich man and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit . It is the face we want . " The man dropped his handful of trailing gulf weed , squared his shoulders and looked pleased . " Si , senor , I have noble blood . My mother . . . " " Was a clever woman , " said Cibo . " Act like her son . " At the dock Juan leaped out and made fast with a flourish . " You see , " said Cibo quietly , as they mounted the broad steps to the , Paseo . " Now keep him coming along that way . " The old city wall rose before them . Along it swept a broad , pavedp455avenue skirting the palm-fringed contours of the bay . A number of pony-drawn hacks driven by black Jehus dashed up avid for fares . But Carlo would have none of them . He dispatched one of his own men on the run through the water gate near by . While they were waiting one of the disappointed ponies reached over and ripped Anthony'ssleeve from elbow to shoulder . " They are carnivorous , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Juan , it is not permitted . " In a few minutes an upholstered carriage with a fair-looking team rolled up . " What do you mean , you rascal , by coming for me with rope traces ? " said Cibo scowling at the black driver . " Go and return on your master 's time . Pompons , buckles , and straw hats ! Do you want to carry home a note with Six ' in the corner ? " The man wheeled off to return in no time with his steeds in another set of harness and with sunbonnets . It gave them a smartly indecent aspect as if the two mares were disguised streetwalkers . Cibo motionedJuan onto the box and they drove off . " There is a habit here when you are annoyed by a slave of simply writing his name on your card with the number of lashes in the corner and sending him home with it , " remarked Carlo complacently . " The card is usually returned later with thanks . The custom imparts a certaintone and discipline to a tropical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the master . It is simply a local form of noblesse oblige . " Cibo pointed to the now positively decorous coachman in a clean , white jacket , and grinned . A red ribbon had been added to the whip . " Already we have assumed nobility , " said Cibo and leaned back . " Voyez-vous , monseigneur ! " They rattled on through a labyrinth of narrow streets with endless , heavy , flat-roofed parapets , whitewashed fronts and heavily grilled windows ; the inevitable patio . Most of the gates were still closed . Havana discovered the same monotonous expression everywhere . It was a frown with a straight line over its eyebrows as if it had acquired it from staring at the sun . Behind the closed shutters one sensed the sombreness of high , toneless chambers nursing the shade . A few slaves carrying baskets on their heads and balancing from the hips passed each other miraculously on the narrow sidewalks . Women in black lace mantillas were still coming home from mass . Here and there a water carrier laid the dust before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every languid activity was merely a prophecy of the certain coming of the midday heat . Suddenly they drew up before the tailor's. , It was a kind of cavern in the street wall of a house . Huge wooden shutters , now propped up as awnings , closed it in at night . A small , brown man who had measuredAnthony at Regla came out bowing . " All is ready , senor , we have only delayed for your choice of but tons . That will take but a moment . " He produced a case of wood and coral samples . " But the English cloth button , or plain silver , iv now all the rage . " In this little spider-of-a-man Anthony thought he understood the word " obsequious " for the first time . He seemed to secrete thread from his mouth , and his shiny lapels flashed with needles as he bowed . Against the rear wall of the place on a long table six little men sat cross-legged , sewing valiantly . On every head was a black skull-cap . They were memorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only men not slaves that Anthony saw doing any manual work . Almost alone these tailors clothed the fashionable Catholic town . Thus even in Havana Abraham flourished as usual on his natural monopoly o f work . The fitting took some time . Cibo was particular . Anthony remembered afterwards that it was here he finally became a sans-culotte . The knee breeches and long silk stockings of the eighteenth century were done up in a bundle . Except upon a few formal and artificial occasions he never wore them again . He emerged from this hole in the wall in long , close-moulded , narrow-waisted trousers cut with a wide Spanish flare from the calves down . There was a V-shaped slit over each ankle through which peeped a crimson sock with a clock . There was a short round jacket with a high , rolled collar . In Cuba there were no tails . Your caballero there haunted the saddle . Underneath the coat was a tight , white shirt with an open breast and pleated ruffles . They must be starched and stand up . A wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left knee . The tassels were a reminder of the sword . But even in Spanish America that was going out for street wear . The sensation of new clothes , which eludes final analysis , metamorphosedAnthony . For him the nineteenth century really began four years ahead of the calendar in that hole in the wall in Havana where the six Jews sat sewing . He had literally shed his old skin . He stood up light , and trim , and airy in the new suit of white drill . His loins were girded with the grateful clasp of the slippery sash and his feet thrust into light pumps with silver buckles which his buttons matched . The sweaty and always bedraggled lace of the old cuff was gone . The new sleeve ended in a clean line . There were no garters at the knees . His calves felt protected . His trousers flapped a little when he walked and they pulled evenly . It gave him a physical feel of confidence in his lower extremities . They were no longer ornamental . This was a costume in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these details Cibo stood by taking a keen and sympathetic interest . It was pleasant to know someone who could understand how . he felt , Anthony thought . It would take the profound simplicity of an Italian to do that . Here was an hour and a place where you adapted yourself and made visible a shift in time . Another mode and mood of things had fallen upon the world . You put it on and then you lived it , henceforth another man . He remembered a naked child in the vestibule of the Casa da Bonnyfeather . Clothes were , he felt , the most intimate and internal things in the world . How tall and keen he was now , how supple and light , how able in this armour to prevail ! " Ah ! Carlo , " he said turning himself about before a mirror  --  and Carlo knew it was not vanity  --  " I shall collect that debt ! " " Good , good , you understand why we came here . Flap your wings and crow , my fine cockerel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpected English gold out of Mr. Bonnyfeather 's roll , and they all laughed . Anthony felt the talons of the little man touch him on the breast . " White ! white like a true caballero of the town , " exclaimed the tailor bowing them out . " He means you are not burnt black like a rider on the sugar plantations , " said Cibo as they drove off . " There is a ring where your collar used to be . But that will soon correct itself in this glare . " Cibo hummed a little and laughed as he chatted away . The tailor amused him . He kept talking about him . " Your Jew sees everything and yet never draws a romantic inference . He only flatters you by telling you that he does . You are pleased in spite of yourself and yet you know that he understands . The Gentileis nakedly revealed in the fiction which he lives by and yet is truly flattered by the Jew . So your feeling toward Jews is one of soothedirritationplus constant surprise . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not deal with Abraham ; they are either lured into his net or driven to seize the club . The complicated balance of emotions necessary to a prolonged traffic with Jews can not persist in peasants . Peasants take one extreme or the other . So your Jew stays in towns . I have dealt with them a long time . Many came here some time ago from Portugal . Lisbon was too hot for them . Your friend the tailor was one . He and I have managed a number of little matters together . I trust him . " In dealing with Jews you should find out what they laugh at . If it is only at matters that occur below the belt let them alone . Simply do not deal with them . Most of that type have a kind of rat's-eye view of life . They see nothing but legs and their appurtenances going by even when they look up . But there are some Hebrews who laugh at the way the world is made . They are humorous with God . Beware ! P458They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the state . Such men are wisely cruel and unbelievably kind . That is : ill . included in the joke . I once saw the little man who just measured you driving in a closed carriage with his wife along the Alameda de Pauli He had introduced a new style into Havana and was watching all the aristocrats preening themselves along the Paseo . Through the curtains I saw him , sitting next to his moon-faced wife , laughing . Ah , Toni , it was terrible . You see , he knew . Most of the land-poor rich in Havana and Pinar del Rio are in debt to him , not only for clothes , but for jewels . He makes loans . If you want gold go to Moses of Cintra . He and I laugh together and we get along . " They turned into the Calle Obispo . Here were business establishmentsand awnings over the sidewalks . A languid flow of traffic toward the Plaza de Armas was already under way . At one place they stopped and Cibo called the proprietor out to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great particularity . " After you get yourself shaved , " said . The convict quarries are always short-handed . Very well , we trust you then . " They drove on to the Caxa de Consolidaciom . Upstairs in the hall of the intendant , where that personage seldom if ever came , Cibo was at some pains to introduce Anthony to several of the clerks , managing to indicate that any papers which might pass through their hands with the senor 's name upon them would be accompanied by double fees . " His business is my own , " said Cibo and lifted his brows . Assurances of extreme solicitude over the senor 's correspondence followed . " They have annual cause to remember me , " whispered Cibo crossing the room . " This is Herr Meyier , a Rhinelander , the only man not a complete rascal in the place . He is the chief clerk . " A pleasant conversation followed . Herr Meyier warmed to Anthony even over his bad German . Anthony supplied him with all the German news he could remember having overheard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by greatly relieved at so promising a turn of affairs . Cibo even pretended to like the beer which Meyier sent out to have brought in from his own restaurant . It was the only beer in Havana , and it was warm . The sympathy of Meyier having been aroused for the predicament ( i f his countrymen in Livorno , it was not difficult for Anthony to enlist his interest in his own affairs . They dropped into Spanish so that Cibo could follow . . . .   " As I see it , " said Meyier , " there are several people with whom you must deal . It would help greatly if you get an official admittance of the debt from Gallego . Without that it is a question , senor , if you can succeed . At least it would enormously hasten matters . Merchants here under the old laws of the Indies are supposed to import only from Spain . Of course , of late years that has been largely disregarded and winked at , and foreign bills must eventually be paid or commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a foreign merchant to press his claims . He must go through the form of transferring his claim to a Spanish firm when it is then presented as a domestic bill and payment allowed . " Now it is a curious thing , " said Herr Meyier smiling , " but there is only one firm here whose foreign claims are ever successful in court . It is the firm of Cuesta and Santa Maria . Senor Santa Maria is a great friend of the intendant . He has retired , but lives , I am told , quite magnificently in the suburb of the Salu . He is said to have remarked once to the bishop at a state dinner that he was not very anxious to go to paradise for awhile since only the pavements there are made of gold . " " We are not especially interested in improving the celestial landscapefor the senor , " murmured Cibo . " Is there no other way ? " Herr Meyier consumed very thoughtfully the last of his beer . It was very tepid . He looked clown the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat in their shirt sleeves at heavily gilded desks  --  with a hint of nausea in his pale blue eyes . " Ach Gott , Cuba ! " he said suddenly , and spread out his palms in disgust . " I am sorry for you , Senor Adverse . What is the amount owed by Gallego and Son to the Casa da Bonnyfeather ? " " About forty-five thousand dollars in round numbers , " replied Anthony . Herr Meyier languidly calculated something and rang a small silver bell . " Engross that for me , " he said to one of the clerks . " Old Senor Gallego has recently died , has n't he ? " continued Herr Meyier while waiting . Anthony nodded . " In that case there may be complications . You might have to levy on his estate . " He shook his head . " I am afraid that will never be granted . Every merchantplanterin the island would protest . What is the son doing ? " " He is in Africa , " answered Cibo . " Since the death of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves . Gallego 's schooner , the Ariostatica , is now outfitting in the harbour for Africa . " " So , " said Meyier , pursing his lips , " so ? " " Would it be possible to attach the ship ? " asked Anthony . " In that case we might come to some agreement with them , possibly an assignmenton the next cargo of slaves . " " Dunder ! " exclaimed Meyier . " I begin to see light . " He rang the bell sharply twice . " Bring me the papers in the case of the ship Black Angel  --  and of the Ariostatica , Gallego , now fitting out . " His heavy bureaucratic face grew suddenly animated . " Now , senor , " said he when all the papers had been brought , " conic into the bureau of the intendant . " He closed the door behind them , listened for a full minute , and then walked to the far end of the room . They all sat clown again about a magnificently furnished desk with dust upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is not likely we shall be interrupted here , " he said sardonically , and spread the papers out before him . " Now , gentlemen , your attention if you please . Let us see if we ca n't avoid drowning the cat in cream . El gato Santa Maria , you understand . Here is what my clerk has engrossed " : $45,000 @ 18 piastres local legal exchange is 810,000 piastres. $45,000 @ 15 piastres current foreign exchange is 675,000 piastres . Hence , the difference between the legal and foreign exchange is135,000 piastres. ( 1/2 of 135,000 piastres is 67,500 piastres ) " The import of this is extremely simple , " continued Herr Meyier . " If you place your claim in the hands of Senor Santa Maria he . will collect it at eighteen piastres on the dollar , the legal rate , and pay you only at fifteen . That will place in his hands the difference of one hundred thirty-five thousand piastres which he and the intendant will divide . I understand they split evenly . For them , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . In order to engage the noble interest of these gentlemen a retaining fee ' of eighteen thousand piastres is customary . Otherwise their valuable time might be wasted in ignoble pursuits . In addition to this you will , of course , have to meet all the legal fees . A jingling argument is the only one really convincing to the court . And on that too the masters of ceremonies here will also collect their percentage . If you leave Havana in a year 's time with thirty-five thousand dollars you will be doing well . You can now see why sugar planting , for those who understand it , is so profitable . Very rich canes are usually crushed and squeezed twice iii case any juice remains . " Carlo whistled whimsically and looked at Herr Meyier , shaking his head . " You may well whistle , Cibo , " said the German . " There is theP461possibility I think , however , of another way . Would you care to have me advise you , Senor Adverse ? As it would be entirely . extra-legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps you would care to  --  er , ah , make use of my humble services under the circumstances . I believe , if you saw fit to do so , you might not only collect the amount due you without the embarrassing deductions required by Senor Santa Maria , but finally emerge perhaps with a comfortable margin of profit . Call it interest on your long overdue account . What do you think ? " " You would not , of course , be averse to participating in the profits of so equitable an arrangement , Herr Meyier ? " asked Anthony . Cibo beamed with approval . " As a silent , a very silent partner , " said the German . " A reasonablepercentage to be agreed upon , say five per cent on your claim , and ten per cent on any possible profits . " " And in any event two per cent on the claim , " said Anthony . " Did you say three ? " murmured the German . " Of course , how could you misunderstand me , Herr Meyier ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junger Herr , thou hast been nursed in the lap of Reason . " " I will be surety , " added Cibo . " We go on then ! " cried Meyier . " Adios , Senor Santa Maria ! Will you condescend to look at these ? " They are the papers of the ship Black Angel , a slaver , which cleared for Sierra Leone it so happens exactly seven years ago today . Now notice , " said Meyier rearranging the file , " that up until within three days of the time she sailed her papers are all in the regular form . Then what happens ? On August thirtieth , seventeen-eighty-nine , an order of temporary sequestration of the ship by the captain-general of Cuba issues . A purser , sworn in as agent of the Caxa de Consolidacion , is put in charge to collect certain sums due the colonial government by the owners . That is , you see , our purser accompanies the ship which is navigated by its captain still employed by the owners . But the cargo of slaves waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here , seven months later are the bills of sale for the entire cargo at public auction at Havana . That is the point of it all . The government agent being on board has prevented the cargo from being taken to a foreign colony , say , Barbados or Jamaica , and quietly run on shore at night . The sale takes place here as of government property . The amount due the crown with all expenses is deducted , and the remainder returned to the owners along with the ship . Even at that , I see , the owners came off fairly well . " " Why did n't the government seize the ship to begin with and sell it ? " asked Cibo .   " The answer is very simple , senor , for two reasons . The ship would not have satisfied the sum required , slavers are only worth a tithe of their cargo , and there is no ordinance for the captain-general to pro ceed upon an order to confiscate marine property . His maritime authority is limited . No , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke of the Gallegos being in the slave trade that it flashed into my mind . Old Senor Gallego has recently died and his son is in Africa . The estate is a huge one . Undoubtedly there will have been a lapse in inheritance fees and other dues and taxes with the heir absent . I f not , trust me , I am a man of arithmetical imagination . Do you see my plan ? " " To use the case of the Black Angel as a precedent and seize the Gallegos ' schooner Ariostatica now in the bay ? " asked Cibo . " Exactly ! " cried Meyier . " An order will be issued of temporary sequestration for the Ariostatica . We shall swear in our young friend here as the government agent in charge . He will go to Africa as supercargo , receive for the crown the cargo which Gallego will have ready for his ship , and return to Havana where it will be sold . That sale , gentlemen , will be conducted by the Caxa da Consolidacion of which I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have nothing to say about it . After the sums due the , er  --  governmentarededucted , any remainder will be scrupulously returned to him . f regret to say , however , that it looks to me as if the entire proceeds o f this particular voyage will be swallowed up . After all , Gallego will only be having his hand forced a little to pay a just debt . If in that process a certain profit is realized , inadvertently as it were , only ourselvesand the captain-general will ever know . I am sure , Senor Ad verse , that if you received the sum due you together with reasonable interest , your curiosity at least would be satisfied . You , you see , will have done nothing but collect your debt plus , let us say , expenses . Your time is of course  --  valuable . Speaking frankly , I feel I am entitled under the peculiar circumstances of the case to the small premium we agreed upon . " " There can be no question about that , Herr Meyier . Set yoursel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , and not from mere curiosity , there are one or two points I do not quite understand yet , " Anthony replied . Cibo leaned forward a little alarmed as Anthony continued . " In the first place , how and why will the captain-general be inter ested enough to issue the order ? And what is there to assure me , in case of your death , for instance , or your leaving here for any cause , that I shall not be sent on a wild goose chase to Africa ? Suppose I am successful and return with the cargo . You are gone . It is sold , and the proceeds pocketed by  --  well , the ' government '  --  why not ? P463Indeed , speaking absolutely candidly , I should feel much relieved if I thoroughly understood the real cause of your interest in my case . " " Herr Meyier and I are old friends , " interrupted Cibo , " we play , I may say , very much into each other 's hands . The scheme is a little more subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ramifications all of which do not appear . His word and mine that you will receive the sum due you should be sufficient . Do n't you think so ? " Anthony sat thinking for a moment . He was aware that the atmospherewas beginning to be a little tense . " Yes , " he said , " I shall accept either of your words , of course . But I must insist at least on knowing the reasons why you will not answer my questions . " Both Cibo and Meyier broke into a laugh . " You might have been educated by the Jesuits , young man , " said the latter . " I was , " said Anthony . " Ah ! " said Cibo . " To think of it ! And how I have talked ! " " For the same reason you can rely on my discretion where my own interests are involved , " interjected Anthony smiling . Carlo snorted . " Tell him , Herman , " he said to Meyier , " or he will find out for himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute . " Ach Himmel ! You are both against me . Then I shall a prophet be . It is modesty , you see , senor , which has kept me from speaking out . Carlo , is it for thee to laugh ? I will tell you , sir , why the captaingeneralwill issue the order . It is because I shall ask him . Carlo , is it not so ? " The man puffed himself out . " It is like this , Senor Toni , " Meyier continued leaning forward and becoming familiar and convincing at the same time . " Have you ever heard of the Prince of the Peace ? Yes ! Well , he is the real ruler of Spain . By many he is said to be ' only the queen 's favourite . He is that , but also much more . It is his desire to put vigour again into the government , to destroy where he can the worm of corruption . " " And to enjoy the increased revenues himself , " interrupted Cibo . Meyier made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Nevertheless it is true that in every part of the government some appointees of the Prince of the Peace are now to be found . They are put there for a purpose and they are feared , for they enjoy the confidence of this great minister at Madrid . That is why I , a German , an accountant , and an honest man , am now the head of the Caxa da Consolidacion en Habana . I , " he repeated , scrawling his own initials dramatically on a piece of paper , " am an appointee of the Prince of the Peace ! Without these initials , P464 no important government financial operation in Cuba is undertaken . With them much may be done . Is it not so , Carlo ? " " You scarcely ever exaggerate , " said Cibo . " But that is not all , my young friend . In Havana there are two parties . There is that of the captain-general and that of the intendantgeneral . It is a very curious situation . Some years ago the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a fiscal reform here . Most of the financial power of the captain-general was placed in the intendant 's hands . Pouf ! what happens ? The second intendant-general who is sent out is a blood brother of Barabbas . Compared with his the clutch of a Turkish bashaw is like that of a gentle milkmaid . The cow  --  Mein Gott ! she go dry ! The intendant is a dangerous man , a successful politician , and he forms a powerful local party . He and Senor Santa Maria and the like had all but succeeded in diverting the revenues when I arrived . The poor old captaingeneral , he is alarmed . In me he sees an unexpected ally . He sends for me and weeps on my shoulder . Permit me , ' he says , to draw my own salary . The intendant and Senor Santa Maria have consolidated the Caxa da Consolidacion . They are patriots . I am only a viceroy . ' " That was seven years ago , my boy . The old captain-general goes home still a poor man . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also is comparatively poor , but he is a great hidalgo and a very cunning man . Very quietly we collaborate on undermining the intendant . The soldiers are now paid out of the revenues . I became head of the Caxa da ConsolidaciOn .. Some money goes home to Spain . We entrench ourselves in , ahem. , a comparative honesty , for we have to fight thieves and we intend to win . Then the grand reforms can take place . But in the meanwhile there is the intendant  --  and Senor Santa Maria . They are still very popular with certain merchants , with , slave importersparticularly . They protect them from foreign creditors . Do you see now ? For this is where you , my young friend , come in ! " As I listened to you this morning I had suddenly the great idea inspired . I see instantly what has long perplexed me . I see how to frighten the friends of the intendant , provide an independent revenue for the captain-general , and permit foreign merchants to collect their debts . The mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be merely an example . It needed just your particular case to enable me to put two and two together , the Black Angel and the Ariostatica . " He slapped the papers . " Senor , I am grateful . The payment of your own debt is assured , for it is upon that pretext that we shall proceed . The authorities in Spain and my master can be made to understand the situation . Despite the old laws foreign merchants must be protected and rascals sup pressed . Indeed , I shall regard the payment of your claims as a kindP465of premium for your going to Africa to collect them . In a case like this it is only someone whose own interests are vitally involved that we would care to trust . Do you see ? Will you go ? Much depends on it . Much ! " Herr Meyier looked suddenly harassed . " It may be a little dangerous , senor . Keep your own council=-and ours . The knife is not unknown here as a method of cutting Gordian knots . I myself . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wohl ! It is true that I may die at any moment ! " He ended on a note of scorn . " I will go , " said Anthony . , Carlo patted him on the arm . " Men are not always such rascals as you think , my young Jesuit , " he said . " Oh , Carlo , you overdo that , believe me , " said Anthony evidently annoyed . " I was right in asking Herr Meyier those questions ! " " What ! what ! Must the old dogs and young ones always be snappingat each other ? " exclaimed Meyier . He tucked his papers under one arm and led them both toward the door with a certain air of triumph . " This is a lucky meeting , you know , " he went on . " Now one thing more . Get that acknowledgment from Gallego 's clerk if you have to garrot him . It is vital . If you have trouble let me know . Ach , my friend Carlo , I rely upon you . Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself will see the captain-general tonight and let you know his decision . I have small doubt about it . You must be prepared , Don Antonio , to visit the palace later on yourself . His Excellency insists upon knowing all his agents personally . " " Would it not be a good precaution to make sure the Ariostatica does not sail too soon , Herr Meyier ? " asked Anthony . " Ach , what a wise infant you have brought here today , Carlo ! " exclaimed Meyier . " His words are dollars . Ja wohl , I shall see to it . An order to the port authorities , quietly ! And now , auf wiedersehen . " He opened the door and bowed them out past the clerks with a formal and distant courtesy as if some purely routine matter had been tritely disposed of . Anthony walked down and climbed into the carriage with his heart on fire . " To Africa ! " he said to the driver . Carlo exploded  --  and gave merely local directions . On the way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the curb still in his sailor 's garb but with a new , silver-mounted guitar under his arm . He looked foolish . " What is the meaning of this ? " inquired Cibo turning red . But the man addressed himself to Anthony . " Pardon , Don Antonio , the money which you gave me to buyP466 clothes  --  I have spent for a guitar . " He ran his hands over its strings caressingly . " I do not know how I do such things . It is terrible . But I have a beautiful tenor voice . I lack accompaniment . Forgive ! " He was white at the lips . " You rascal ! " said Anthony . Then he laughed . " Jump up , Juan . Driver , go on . " With the troubadour on the box they drove to the Gallegos ' . " You had better leave this to me , " said Cibo , and went in . It was sweltering sitting in the carriage under the leather top . " Senor , " said Juan looking around at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sing to you while we wait ? I am your hombre . I would pour out my heart which is full of a passionate gratitude . " " Later on , Juan , " said Anthony . " This is a respectable neigh-bourhood . " " Si , si , " said the man and sighed . Carlo finally emerged with a scarea , middle-aged clerk who rode with them silently to the notary . The man made a declaration there setting forth that the sum demanded by Mr. Bonnyfeather was a just debt contracted by Gallego &; Son for value received . He signed it as chief clerk of the firm , and an attested copy of his power of attorney to transact business during the absence of young Senor Gallego was attached . They left him still white about the gills . " This paper has cost you five hundred dollars , Don Toni , " said Carlo as they drove on toward the water gate , " but it is worth it . Never hire a chief clerk with a sombre past , " he added . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A blue glimpse of the bay came in sight through the old water gate . " Oh , I shall be glad to meet Cheecha with her little wagon on the veranda , " said Cibo . " There is pompano today . The one fish I . . . " He was interrupted by a scream of agony that made them both wilt . The thud of a whip , and the answering cries and moans of a number of black women gathered about a gate the carriage was just passing made a horrid chorus that accompanied spasmodically the whistling of a lash . " Jesus ! " whispered Juan . The strings of his guitar jangled faintly . The carriage stopped as if accosted by death . They looked through the gateway into the space beyond . In the centre of a wide patio floored with blinding , white sand a great , black grating seemed to erect its sinister gridiron malevolently from the top of a little platform . Lashed to this so that he was spreadeagledhelplessly against the blue sky beyond was a black Hercules of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head hung back straining as if it would tear itself loose and be gone . Under eachp467whistling blow he rippled from head to foot and screamed hoarsely. " 0 God ! " said Anthony standing up . It was just then that they saw Brother Francois . He had emerged suddenly from a little door and was crossing the white , sunlit space to the gridiron in his bare feet and faded gown . He cried out and the sound of his voice filled the place with pity . The man with the whip turned . His large , jowled countenance fell flat with amazement . Nothing but the moans of the man on the gridiron could be heard . " In the name of Christ , " said the clear , quiet voice of Brother Francois , " this man is your brother . " He took the whip from the man 's hand . A dead silence followed . Suddenly the man seemed to take in the situation . He gave a roar of astonished rage , and picking up Brother Francois like a child , rushed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gutter and started to return . " Do not interfere , my son ! " cried the monk getting up calmly out of filth . He caught Anthony by the coat and dragged him back against the wheel of the carriage . He put his cool hands on his cheeks . " This is for inc . Remember , you do not understand yet . " When a kind of red darkness cleared from his eyes Anthony found Cibo holding him down in the carriage . Rage had loosened the caps of his knees till he shook . Brother Francois was half across the yard again . He was following the man and calling . The fellow turned sullenly . Brother Francois advanced smiling , holding out his hand . " My friend , " he said . The man gave a confused bellow and rushed him . He threw him down on the sand and kicked him . Then he turned to go again . " My friend , " said Brother Francois rising . He advanced upon him again still holding out his hand . The performance repeated itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cibo holding Anthony . " Let God decide . Who are you ? " Brother Francois was getting up again , slowly now . He stood swaying a little but he still smiled . Suddenly he tottered forward to the man . He held up his little crucifix and pointed to the negro on the grating . Then he held out both his hands as if he would give shelter to the dew-lapped head of the tormentor on his own breast . The figure on the grating gave a great cry and went limp . The elan in the courtyardlooked about him as if appealing to the common sense of mankind and fled . The whip lay on the sand . " Now , " cried Cibo . " Now ! " He laboured after Anthony and Juan had dashed into the court where Brother Francois had fallen limp . The three of them picked him up and carried him limp as he was to the carriage . " Go ! " shouted Cibo . " Whip your horses , you black fool ! "  |p468Juan  caught hold of the carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A shriek of despair from the women at the gate followed it as it wheeled around the next corner . On the way back to Regla Brother Francois opened his eyes . They were pouring cool water on his face and hands . He said nothing . A great sorrow seemed to engulf them all . Ashamed of himself , Anthony cried out at the sight of the battered lips which hurt themselves to smile back at him . A tumult as of great waters had rushed through his soul . He sat and wept . Even Cibo was silent . But at Regla Brother Francois insisted upon going home himself . He forbade them to come along . They watched him go down the little alley toward Father Trajan 's , and as he turned the corner they saw him lift a basket of fish from the head of a small negro child whose legs wobbled under it . He took her by the hand . The negro boatmen grunted . " I am afraid that this is the end of Brother Francois , " said Cibo as they walked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without being recognized . Do you know what the penalty is for interfering with slaves who have been sent to the city-yard to be whipped ? A monopoly of Senor Santa Maria , by the way . No ! You do not know ? Well , then so much the better , " he said as he swung the little door into the cool green patio , " so much the better for your appetite for lunch . Cheecha ! " P469A MANTILLA INTRUDES HOT countries , Anthony discovered , had a curious effect upon him . He had ebullitions of emotion ; they passed , and left him much the same as before , dreamfully contented , merely existingcomfortably . The crests did not disturb the norm which was , after all , Cibo in his chair on the veranda with rum and lime juice . Then there was tobacco . He had begun to soak up a good deal of that into his system , the dark Cuban leaf . It made contentment easy and keenness uncomfortable . It prevented in a northerner the constantfoolish necessity of doing something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whipping had made upon him only a week ago  --  what was it now ?  --  only an event of the extremely remote past , he thought as he sat smoking on the veranda with Cibo , while a half-moon filtered into the patio and Juan fooled below on the strings of his new guitar . That lad did have a voice undoubtedly . A half-mocking song , no doubt addressed to Cheecha , mixed its soft chords with the moonlight and caused the parrot to shift sleepily on its perch . Tonight it was deliciously fragrant and cool . Pretty late though . Still you could not expect to sleep all the afternoon and all the night as well . The end of his cigar glowed revealing Anthony 's face a little whiter than when he arrived , wrapt in a dreamful satisfaction ; Cibo smiled to himself . Yes , on the whole , as Cibo said , he had been lucky . His visit to Havana might so far be called a promising success . Brother Francois was doing very well . Getting about the garden again  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed as he thought of his crowded chapel . Carlo had certainly been most convincing with the bishop . It would take a long time , of course , to get the final confirmationfrom Santiago . Meyier seemed slow , too . But you could n't hurry the captain-general . You could n't hurry anybody here , not even yourself . And the Ariostatica had been detained . He began to wonder how his clothes that he was to wear at the audience at the palace the next afternoon were coming on at the tailor 's . Moses had promised them . Why could n't Meyier settle all those details with the governor himself ? Curious old dog that German ! Able , and honest according to his own lights . Really tryingP470 to do a difficult job here . No one could live on a government salary in Havana . They were n't expected to . Ah , well , if Africa was like this it would n't be so bad . " Good night , Carlo . " The cigar streaked into the patio , and he went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jorham to see the tombs . He wished now he had n't promised her . Promises made in one mood could come back to haunt you in another . " Damn the beetles ! " How they battered about the candle . " Puff ! " In the darknessyou were yourself again . No one on the wall . . . no , of course not . . . in the chest . And a good riddance . . . Yes ? Mrs. Udney 's sheets , ah-a-a .. . But once on the Wampanoag again next morning it was not so hard to recapture the mood of only a few days before . It no longer seemed so far off . And both Captain Elisha and Mrs. Jorham were so glad to see him , and Collins dry as ever . That solemn face ! " So ye 're harbourin ' our desartar , Mr. Adverse . " Captain Jorham made small bones about Juan , however . The prices which he had recived for his miracle-working statuary had been miraculous . " They 're all gone but Jesus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all , on an oxcart for some inland town . I 'm holdin ' out on the Saviour for eight hundred dollars with five hundred and thirty offeredand a vacant niche in the cathedral biddin ' against a new chapel at Cienfuegos . " He rubbed his hands . " Say how dew ye suppose they fixed that Virgin at Regla ? Pretty slick , eh . ! Got any idears , mister ? " " Not a single one , captain , " said Anthony gravely . " Sal-ay ! " said the captain beating him on the back till he coughed . " But here comes the old lady all set for seem ' the t-umes . " Mrs. Jorham was indeed dressed for the occasion . Long , fingerless , black gloves projected from her India shawl which was caught with a jet breast pin . A straw bonnet upon which rested a grey dove still glistened with camphor dust . ' A small sunshade , and a palm-leaf fan , as a slight concession to the climate , announced her upon pleasure bent . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But under her bonnet her face shone . A neatly bound copy of the Testament and four silver dollars distended her reticule . Anthony handed her into Cibo 's boat with great formality . She sat on the cane seats rather doubtfully and raised a doll-sized sunshade against the Cuban glare . From a strictly female point of view Mrs. Jorham was undoubtedly one of the most intriguing women who had ever landed at the water gate at Havana . The negro washerwomen gathered there to discuss her.  |p471Anthony  hailed one of the carnivorous ponies . In what appeared to Mrs. Jorham to be a recklessly extravagant mode of travel they set forth to do epitaphs . But the churches were a flat disappointment to the lady from Scituate . What few tombs they contained were to her sadly lacking in a sense of inevitable doom . The smooth pomp of marble and basalt conveyed a feeling of security in the hereafter , even an aristocratic contempt for it which outraged her . In the tone of the epitaphs she missed a single whine . " Every hour wounded ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell . " There were candies burning before that ! She turned away , longing for some stone that recorded a snatch of thoroughly abject hymn that a Protestant woman could sing with fearful conviction . These churches seemed to have been built by superior beings for man . She longed for her white wooden chapels with a fanlight over the door and a cold , northern light inside . Chapels that man had built for God ! One could make up one 's own mind about religion there . Here , as she looked about from one church to the other , she saw that religion had long ago made up its mind about her . She snorted and waved her palm-leaf fan . To Anthony , Mrs. Jorham was intensely interesting . He was curious to understand her sense of Protestant outrage . They went to Santa Catalina , San Agustin , and Santa Clara . They saw the curious oil paintings on the walls of La Merced . In the bare , grey limestone of old Santo Domingo they sat down on the floor and rested . Here for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What was it made her so indignant ? " he wondered , " and so grim ? " He would like to take her to the cathedral . Poor soul , perhaps it was her idea of pleasure that made her so sad ? He had a notion to try on a good time for her benefit . Havana with Mrs. Jorham ! He went out and hired a double carriage , only one of whose wheels was very oval . With her little mushroom sunshade projecting over the back like the small - Large of a defiant warrior they left the churches and drove along the sea wall and the Alameda clear out to the Cortinade la Reina , and out the Paseo de Tacon to El Principe . " My ! " said Mrs. Jorham , semi-approvingly , as the incomparable gardens of Los Molinos burst on her view . Good , she was thawing ! He himself felt like St. Lawrence and it was only ten o'clock . Underan awning in the old Parque de la India they had claret lemonade . He took her to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive fan . He whirled her around the monastery of Belen at Luz and Compostela streets . Dashing as recklessly as he could prevailon the driver to dash , he finally wound up on O'Reilly where he bought her a black mantilla and made her put it on . Why he did all this he could not tell . Mrs. Jorham had touched off something ofP472 the devil in him . Mrs. Jorham in a mantilla was so gorgeous a solecismhe almost began to make love to her . He finally bought her a chameleon on a chain . They live in cemeteries , Mrs. Jorham , and change colour , " he explained . But she did not believe him . She put the chameleon in her bag with the Testament and the four silver dollars . He felt profoundlysorry for it . In the great heat he felt sorry for a chameleon in a reticule. 0 God ! Here he was driving about in Havana with an old woman . He did not know any other woman in the whole place . Yes , Cheecha ! He bought another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he hummed close by her ear as they drove off again . " What is the matter with ye , young man ? " said Mrs. Jorham through a mouthful of black lace . He looked at her . She was having a good time ! He had a notion to let Cheecha 's chameleon run up the back of the driver . The horses might run away then . No ! Instead he would take Mrs. Jorham to the cathedral and show her the tomb of Columbus . Mrs. Jorham sniffed disdainfully at the holy water from which the mosquitoes rose as Anthony dipped his fingers in it . The interior of the cathedral was still full of scaffolding . Some frescoers at work held her attention . She had never seen a painter at work before . She stood looking up till she was dizzy . They went over and sat down on unusedstone blocks that had not yet been removed before the Admiral 's new tomb . Several parties of fashionably dressed people began to arrive while Mrs. Jorham sat fanning herself . It was certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street . A verger came and uncovered the font . " I alers did think Columbus was the bravest of them all . Crossin ' the ocean fer the first time ! It 's bad enough now ' specially if yer husband ca n't navigate . Columbus believed in what he knew , of course . But it must have ban hard to get folks to do somethin ' so new . " The distant wail of a baby interrupted Mrs. Jorham . She laid her fan spasmodically on her chest as if she had caught her breath . The organ started to play . Anthony looked up. l re was surprised to see the number of people who had come in . And the sound of more carriages arriving at the door could still be heard . " There is going to be a christening , Mrs. Jorham , rather a fashionableone I think . Look , the bishop is here to bless the child . I f we move over there in that corner we can see it all without disturbing them . Here by the big pillar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . Look at the jewels and laces and uniforms ! " she exclaimed half to herself.  |p473They  drew back in their corner and waited while the family arrangeditself about the font . The service began , evidently as long and complete a one as wealth and influence could obtain . Mrs. Jorham watched the small howling bundle of lace being passed from hand to hand , held up and waved about , sprinkled , and sung about in Latin . So much to-do over a baby made her think better of the Catholic Church . But that was not what Anthony was looking at . Between the responses he had fallen helplessly in love . The girl was standing directly opposite him just across the nave . And of such a witches ' bundle and mad faggot of chances is fate composed that if he had not happened to move a little to clear himself of the pillar he might never have laid eyes on her at all . Or , if he had seen her otherwhere he might not have fallen in love . He might only have admired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have really seen her . Her image might only have fallen upon his eyes with no penetration . But he did move . And as he stepped out from the pillar , at that instant , his pupils were opened upon the extremely delicate and mysterious living substancebehind them . Looking inward he beheld a divine image within himself . He could not have imagined it in all its overpowering charm and living splendour . It was something which now drew upon reality and had its own independent vigour and validity although it was nourishedwithin him . Looking into . the outer world he saw a Spanish girl in a mantilla , with nearly black-blue eyes and pale gold-gleaming hair , regarding him over her fan . And the outward and inner images became one . The next instant their eyes met . Exactly what happened then he could not tell . There was undoubtedly a current that passed between them . He had an irrefutable intuition that what was going on in his own eyes was also occurring in hers . The effect upon his body was a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillar for an instant and closed his lids . When he opened them again he saw that she was still studying his face . Then a wave of colour rushed up from her neck and shoulders and she disappeared behind her fan . Heavens , would she never come out of that eclipse ! At the font the sponsors were promising on behalf of the wailing baby impossible things . Several millenniums passed . The fan spread a little . It came down as far as her chin . Splendour of Angels ! Already he had forgotten how lovely she was . You could only remember it when you really saw her . He must always be able to see her . Always ! Why , she was smiling at him ! At him ! Already there was a great secret between them . He straightened up and leaned forward a little . She shook her head . It was just the dream of a shake . Ah ! She saw him now . Who was thatp474 dignitary beside her ? Her father or an uncle , no doubt ! Damn his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But be careful . He would just answer her smile . He did so . The fan seemed to touch her lips . No ? Well , he could not be sure . Now it made a graceful curve , opened out a little , and rested on her breast . She might have been fanning herself ! He put his own hand under his coat and looked at her . . . Then he hastily managed to turn that heartfelt gesture into a trite continuation of removing his handkerchief from his left pocket . " Uncle 's " eyes were taking him in coldly . Everything that could be done for the baby was now completed . As an impeccable candidate for the communion of saints it and its family and friends departed , leaving Anthony leaning against the pillar hopelessly . Suddenly he realized he was being left in darkness . He rushed out just in time to see her driving ay-ay . " Senorita Dolores de la Fuente , " said the verger . He gave the man a gold piece and never knew it . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was sitting again before the tomb of Columbus . " Mrs. Jorham , Mrs. Jorham , " cried Anthony seizing her by both hands and dragging her off a marble block . " Mrs. Jorham , I 'm in love ! " " Now look here , young man , now look here , " she said , snatching at her reticule . " Ye behave yerself . The idear ! But air ye in love ? " she said , " air ye ? " peering out of her bonnet into his face . " Swan to man , I believe ye be ! " The verger , scandalized , looked at them and then went away . For short of arson the donors of a gold piece were , so far as he was concerned , invisible . " You wo n't say anything , will you , Mrs. Jorham ? " said Anthony as the sober light of day overwhelmed him at the door . " We 'll just cancel secrets , mister , and call it square , " said she . " I never was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she added , laying her black glove on his arm . " Na-ow , " she gave a little sigh , " ye might take me home . Listenin ' to that baby squallin ' kind of made me anxious over ' Lisha . I guess ye know our secret . " They found the crew of the boat from the Wampanoag waiting with their jackets spread out on oars against the glare of the noon sun . Anthony was keeping Cibo 's boat until later . " I did have a good time , " said Mrs. Jorham as she arranged hersel f in the stern sheets . She gayly waved her hand with the black glove on it . Collins grinned back at Anthony as they pulled away . Anthony saw her shawl fall out of its rigid folds into something more natural . At a little distance over the water she looked smaller , even frail . Suddenlyhe saw what Mrs. Jorham must have looked like as a young girl.  |p475That  must be what was caught in Captain Jorham 's eyes . Yes , he understood now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warn panaog was ! Home ! Whenever on sea or land , whenever . . . " Dolores , I must find you ! " He ran up the steps again and jumped into a carriage . It was terrible to have business to do when he did not even know where she lived . " Where , senor ? " " Ah , where indeed ? Perhaps the driver would know ! " But he could not bring himself to mention her name to him . Her name ! He felt tears gathering behind his eyes . " Senor ? " What the devil then ! To the tailor 's ? His suit would not be quite done yet . But a last fitting before going to the captain-general 's . . . " Moses of Cintra in the Calle Obispo . " " Si , si ! El judio . " The man whipped up and drove off . P476THROUGH A COPY O F V E L A S Q U E Z IF CARLO had not warned Anthony to pay strict attention to the advice of the little tailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he found waiting for him at the cubicle of Moses . It was dark , but gorgeous , and of the style Incroyable which the smart old Jew had just imported from Paris . Such a collar Anthony had never seen . " I have made certain alterations , " said Moses , " a concession to local taste . Those who go to an audience with His Excellency should bear in mind that he prides himself on being a very modern man . It is not only in clothes but in government , senor , that to a certain extent he admires the French taste . New times , new fashions , and new minds , ' is a favourite saying of his . Permit me to pin the waist a little tighter . It is the Herculean bust , that which looks so well on the orator when he gestures from the rostrum with one hand in his breast , which has now come in . Ah ! I am always breaking my chalk . More pins , Sabathio . But I would not advise you to orate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Great men always talk a great deal , " continued Moses , despite his mouthful of pins . " They realize by a lifetime of conversational disappointments that others seldom have anything to say . Have you not found it so yourself , senor ? Pardon , I slipped with that pin . And many are coming to believe here that Don Luis de las Casas is really a great man . In six years he has worked wonders . The Marques de Someruelos who will shortly be sent out to succeed him is also of the modern cast of mind , they say . No , it would never do to go to the palace resembling an old hidalgo . They are out of date here . And the general will observe you keenly . He will question you without your knowing it . It has been his method here always to see personallythose who are doing anything for him . All those who serve him must first be his friends . It is thus that he has made headway against the intendant . By his Junta as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Drake  --  even the bishop and the military are of his party . I myself have the honour of making his clothes ! You can see you have been fortunate in Havana in having your ends shaped by powerfulhands . There now ! I think that will do . Some last stitching and the iron ! Ah , the hot goose ! What would tailors be withoutp 477it ? " He grinned and spat out the remaining pins . " A dangerous conversation , you see , senor . It would not do to swallow my words . " While the last touches were going on they went over and sat down , Anthony on a chair and Moses crosslegged on a table . " Do you happen to know anything of a certain Senorita Dolores de la Fuente ? " asked Anthony . " I should be glad of a little informationabout her . " He was relieved to be able to say her name so casually. ... y Someruelos ! Do not forget that ! Senorita Dolores de la Fuente y Someruelos , a niece of the incoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his eyesight . Yes , all Havana knows . She has preceded her uncle here with certain relatives and domestics to set up his establishment at Los Molinos . A lady with the true gracia of old Castile . " It is because the present governor has permitted her to move into the palace that it is plain to all the world how the political wind blows . If the present and the newly-appointed captain-general were not both liberals the senorita would have to wait . As it is , the palace will now he all ready for her uncle when he comes . Extensive alterations are under way . All of the domestics are to have new liveries . " Moses rubbed his hands . " At the palace ! I shall he under the same roof with her in a few hours , " Anthony said half aloud . " Pardon me , senor ; but I do not think you will see her at Los Molinos , " said Moses . " Don Luis has taken her under his wing like an eagle . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " Anthony held up his hand . " I understand , " he said . Nevertheless , as he put on his suit for the audience he felt fired with hope . " Dolores was at Los Molinos ! " Moses charged for advice as well as for his cloth , Anthony discoveredwhen he paid the bill . But it was worth it , he felt , as he drove on to Herr Meyier 's small establishment in a street just off the plaza . And he was enjoying himself . He wished Vincent were along . ! low he would gape at this raiment . What had become of Livorno , anyway ? In the vividness of the present his old days seemed to belong to someone else . Old clothes  --  he would have to get into them again to remember what they felt like . Even one 's contour changed . Ile kicked the bundle of the suit he had worn to the tailor 's . Then he remembered he had left his watch in it ! Well , he was already late for the appointment with Herr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of papers to go over carefully . The order for the temporary sequestration of the schooner was made out , : Anthony 's appointment as government agent , and an authorization to seize the slaves . All of these already bore the seal of the Caxa deP478 Consolidacion and lacked only the signature of the captain-general . Annexed to these were the long records of the process of the government in the case of the Black Angel , the rescript of the Council t the Indies confirming it , and a decision of the alcalde-major dated the day before called " Processional Confirmation of Precedent in Camera . " " All of these papers , " said Meyier , " you will please notice , Don Antonio , are in triplicate . One set for you , one for my bureau , and copies for the captain-general . The last paper with the high-sounding title is the most important of all . It means that the highest court in Cuba has certified that the case of the Black Angel is a precedent upon which the executive government here can act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this first one . Do you see ? ' I n Camera ' simply shows that the decision has been made at the private request of the captain-general and is confidential . No public notice of it is required . It is simply certified back to him as valid . Perhaps you do not fully appreciate the beauties of Roman Civil Law from the standpoint of a government official . From now on all that the executive has to do to seize any slaver is to  --  well , seize it  --  and certify that it is precedental with the case of the Black Angel . The viceroy 's signature makes it so . It is then a fact in law . To re-establishpossession for themselves the owners of slaves who have been subjected to the process must prove conclusively that the government is in error , that is , that the case is not a precedent . That is very difficult to do , and in the meantime the slaves must remain in the government'spossession and may be sold . It is simply beautiful ! " I may say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that this puts a weapon in our hands for which we have long been searching . The slave interests are powerful and have been the most active element behind the intendant and Senor Santa Maria , the patriots , ' as they call themselves . Now they belong to us . Only one example will be needed . Senor Gallego is unfortunate . But that first example we must have . " You must therefore thoroughly understand all of this when you take the papers to the captain-general to be signed . He is a pent. trating and exacting man . I have explained your mission here to him and I have also stretched a point by indicating that it was you ti ) whom we should be grateful for suggesting this process . That in a sense is true . " He waved his hand deprecatingly . " Naturally I worked out the details , but let that go . He will give you the credit . We shall all participate in the benefits . " " Are you sure the captain-general does want to see me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why he insists upon seeing you but I think I know . This case is a very important one . Out of it may proceedp479much revenue for the palace . Don Luis would assure himself that he is placing this matter in competent hands . It will be for you to convince him of that . If he feels you can carry this seizure through , your own reward , the matter of the Gallego debt , will be a trifle . But I am being frank . If he does not like you , he will find someone else and there will be nothing left for you to do but to make your suit to Senor Santa Maria . There is much risk in all this for you . I do not conceal that . You must , for instance , on the way to Africa avoid  --  well , avoid falling overboard . But I think I am right in feelingthat you will not be prevented easily or cavil at small things . By God ! senor , make the captain-general like you . Become a convincing young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have a further proposition to make you . If he does I advise you to accept . If not- " he shrugged his shoulders  --  " there is one thing more . What is your nationality ? Where were you born ? " " I do not know , " said Anthony turning red . " So ? " said Meyier looking at him appraisingly . Then he laughed . " Don Antonio Adverso , citizen of the Western Hemisphere , white , a subject of God ? No , no , that will not do . It is a legal fiction you need in order to exist . " " I suppose I am English , " said Anthony . " Why , senor ? " " I can not answer you , Herr Meyier , a matter of honour . " " Teufel ! Englishmen are seldom mysterious about being Englishmen . But , we cavil unnecessarily . Will you take an oath of allegiance to the King of Spain in order that the law may be able to see you favourably , and hence for your own protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much the same about this oath as he had felt about Father Xavier 's wafer . As he looked at Herr Meyier he could see that he was both disgusted and surprised . He was losing ground with him  --  and there was the debt . Should he sell himself to collect that ? But why put it that way ? This was only an earthly affair , himself and the King of Spain . He could bargain there . " I will take the oath if you do not register it , " said Anthony . " Good ! I will only have it attested , to produce if necessary , " grunted Meyier , and sent for a notary . So Anthony swore with his hand . " It is , " he told himself , " a compromise . " They packed the papers in one of Meyier 's portfolios and put a lead seal on it . " Himmel ! " Meyier had said at last , leaning into the carriage . " Do not let trivialities interfere with your success , Don Antonio , even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No ? " Anthony had left Meyier grinning and waving good luck . P480 Incidents like these that threatened to uncover the merely vague grounds for the supposition of his own existence were terribly disconcerting . They left him melancholy . Herr Meyier 's banter about the oath had gone deep . With Meyier the oath was a mere formality . Herr Meyier was a German . He was sure of himself . He had been born into and turned out of a mould . He was irrevocable to himsel f and to all men . He remained a German no matter what oaths he took . But Anthony  --  what of him ? " Citizen of the Western Hemisphere , white ! " How deep that cut ! In all the inherited loyalties of men he had no part . At the table of the sun he drank to no king . He had no right to he there which was humanly visible . Perhaps Cibo was right and he should attach himself to something . But Mr. Bonnyfeather 's legacy had made that difficult because it was unnecessary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a living . Life . would be just a game with the means assured and no ends to play for except to win . Win what ? Undoubtedly he must find something . Suppose  --  suppose a citizen of the Western Hemisphere proposedmarriage to Senorita Dolores de la Fuente y Someruelos . What would he say , for instance , to the de la Fuentes and the Someruelos ? He knew what he would say to Dolores . That would not be in the realm of logical argument  --  but to them ? And he knew now that they would be there , too . The best he could now do would be to whisper something to Dolores in the moonlight  --  and go away . Someone like that baby this morning who had sponsors for himself must be the final accredited cavalier . Well , he would go on . He would see . Perhaps the Western Hemispheremight be a mould . Feeling vaguely English because he looked it , and being sure himself that he was born , he would pour himself out into the mould . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would also take his cradle of the pool in the convent with her . It was the only one he had had . That  --  and a certain face on a miniature which he must never speak of . To hell with all that , then ! Here I am . I know that . I will try following up one practical thing , call my object all , and see where it leads to . Object , the debt . I will collect that . I make an oath to myself . The oath to the King of Spain is purely contributory . It is a means . Result so far : I have achieved nationality . Supposing the debt to be " x " I shall simply work out its value to me in the terms of what happens while I collect it thus : y ( The Wampanoag + Havana + Africa ) = xNow then , I make a note of that . Memorandum for A. A. Ile set it all down  --  andy = the unknown factor of myself. p 481 , et us see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well , this is a non-human equation , not a logical one . To supply the value of luck would require a constant unknown factor operating throughout . To to able to know that would also imply being able to know " x " in advance . He put his notebook into his pocket rather pleased with his fancy . " Hence you see , " he told himself , " it follows . . . what follows ? That I am being drawn by two horses to see the Captain-General of tuba at Los Molinos and Dolores is there . Very good , that !  --  Driver , a little faster please . I must be there by four o'clock . So this is what carriages are about . How reasonable ! " Yet what he really enjoyed , now that all the important business was set down in a " mathematical " memorandum , was the mysterious and easy pleasure of forward motion as he rolled along over the new militaryroad toward Los Molinos . Having a constant series of impressionsfollow each other in rapid succession without doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased life . He was enjoying as a more powerful being might enjoy . The horses had accelerated fate and made the world change . In the collection of the debt , in solving " x , " this would be one of the most enhancing experienceshe felt . " Driver , faster ! Use your whip ! " They flew along now . The gardens of Los Molinos with the summer palace of the captains-generalcame in sight , a gleam of old ivory in a tossing sea of palms . In those living depths the wind blew the treetops back into white , glistening spots that shivered in the sea of green like the Carib- ! wan lashing over a hidden reef . A sentry emerged from a gold-and -- scarlet striped box and took his pass . Ten minutes later Anthony was ushered into the Hall of the Governors of Cuba . At first he could not see anyone there . The rather low room with grey stone walls and a moulded stucco ceiling looked more like a corridor than an apartment . It ran clear across the front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to floor . Through these , like reflections from the surface of a lake , fell the shuffling lights and shades of the waving palm fronds without which mirrored themselves and rippled aquidly upon the gleaming , ebony ! loor . Shifting spots of sunlight and half-lights flowed along the grey walls and lent an almost liquid aspect to the atmosphere of the room . Indeed , it was no wonder that the eye at first lost itself in this ancient apartment . Had Anthony seen tropical fish come swimming through the windows he would not have been surprised , High , narrowp482 teakwood chairs , set at stately intervals ; chairs upholstered in faded red brocade shot through with tarnished silver threads died away into the watery perspective as if all those who had sat on them were dead and this was the cabin of a foundered galleon . It was not until his eyes adjusted themselves to the somnolent and stealthy shifting of shadows that at last in the centre bay of the windows he discovered the captain-general himself . He was standing with his back turned looking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announce him , for Anthony could still see his card lying on a silver tray before the governor 's desk chair . " Your Excellency , " said Anthony . General Las Casas turned with a slight twist of annoyance . Seeing it was not a lackey he hastily picked up the card , read it , and immediatelybroke into a quiet smile . Anthony could scarcely restrain a start of surprise . Here was the same gentleman who had been standing beside Dolores in the cathedral . " Come over , Don Antonio , I am glad to see you . Have I kept you waiting long ? Ah , I see . Well , you are not the first who has not been able to find me in this  --  aquarium . " He pointed Anthony to a chair by his escritoire , answering his bow with an easy and winning courtesy . " You must really co-operate with me in helping to . set aside the old formalities of a viceregal court , " continued the general leaning his head on one hand and looking at Anthony frankly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything done in Cuba by in - sisting that this is the Escurial . It has shocked some of the old Castilianseven here . But formalities are not the end of life any more . Things have been happening in Paris , you know . One must admit they exist . New times , new fashions , and new minds , ' I often say . I ' see you believe at least in cutting your clothes to the year . You will not be shocked , I trust , if I do not permit you to kiss my hand ? " " Thank you , for breaking the ice of etiquette so thoroughly , sir , " said Anthony . " I confess to coming here with considerable trepidation , despite the assurances of your many friends in Havana . " " I was not aware my friends in Havana were so numerous , " said the governor . " But it is pleasant to hear you say so . You yourself , Don Antonio , seem to have fallen into excellent hands . Herr Meyicr and our good Carlo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been given to suppose that it will not be difficult for us to arrive at a conclusion about certain matters , and to our mutual advantage . You have already made a very happy suggestion , I am told . " An thony saw his eyes rest on him inquiringly . " I shall be frank with Your Excellency . A very small part of thep483credit for that suggestion is due to me . It was only something I said inadvertently which enabled Herr Meyier . to . . . " " Tut , tut ! " exclaimed the governor . " You dispraise yourself . But I see you are honest even in claiming credit and that is , to say the least , refreshing here . Your inadvertency was a very happy one . Go on , make some more . But Herr Meyier has entrusted you with some papers , I believe ? " " Here , " said Anthony laying the sealed portfolio on his desk . " You may gain some insight into the conditions of this business , " remarked the general as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I tell you that it is only to a messenger whose own interests are inseparable with their safe delivery here that these papers would be entrusted . Do you realize , my young friend , " continued he opening his eyes a little wider , " that if certain gentlemen here in Havana had known of the contents of this portfolio neither you nor it would have arrived here this afternoon ? As it is I have no doubt whatever that you are already being watched . " " I am prepared to take the risks which will inevitably be involved if Your Excellency sees fit to trust me , " said Anthony . " It is true my own interests are involved in this affair but that is not my main motive , sir . I want you to know that . No , there is something more . " le hesitated . " Go on , " said the governor , " I am really curious now . " " It is the thing itself , " Anthony burst out , " the difficulties that are in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through with it . I would find out for myself how I shall cope with this affair . But I suppose that is not what I should have told you . " The governor answered with a quick flash of his white teeth . He drummed on the desk for a minute with the end of his pen . Then he started to sign the papers . " On the contrary I am very glad you have said it , Don Antonio . It puts a new face on the matter . We shall not simply be using each ether for so much cash . It encourages me , in fact , to propose to you something further since you are a caballero with whom gold is not all . What I shall say now is between us only , as men of honour . Is that agreeable ? " " You have my word , sir , but I reserve my decision as to your proposal . " " Naturally . Do not imagine I would inveigle you . Quite the contrary . In fact , as you shall see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself to your hands . " He leaned forward and began to sand the papers for a minute . Then he looked up frankly and continued . " Senor , in a few months I return to Spain . I return there a poorerP484 man than when I arrived here six years ago . It might have been otherwise if I had cared to play the game here with the intendant and Senor Santa Maria . Meyier has told you of them ? So ! You under stand then . But perhaps you do not understand fully . The ' game ' is to separate Cuba from the crown of Spain . Troubled times are now with us and more ahead . With universal war brewing in Europe we shall soon be separated for months from Madrid . Insurrection gathers here . My successor , the Marques de Someruelos , my cousin , will soon be left here alone to struggle with those who call themselves patriots . Need I add that their conception of patriotism is the concentration of revenue in their own hands ? The intendant is not with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest difficulty that I have succeeded in having a loyal successor to myself appointed , a man of honour and ability , a liberal , but loyal . To smooth the way for himself he has sent his niece out in advance to set up his house hold here at Los Molinos . Social prestige is very important in Cuba among the great landholders . I am a widower and have been handicapped . But with the arrival of the Senorita Dolores we have been co-operating in building up the viceregal court . When my successor arrives there will be a court for the royalists to rally about . It has been very difficult for her . She has had to disregard many conservativecustoms . But  --  as you seemed to observe this afternoon in the cathedral -- she is a senorita of singular charm . " He leaned back and laughed , enjoying Anthony 's obvious confusion . " I see to a certain extent you have already joined our party , " he continued . " That is well . Much serenading now takes place on moonlitnights in the gardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is true . But we have gained a number of the influential young caballeros to our side , for the cult of Dolores must also , by her decree , be the policy of the King of Spain . There have been dinners  --  and duels . Several troublesome patriots have been removed  --  honourably . It is now fashionable to come to court on certain afternoons to kiss the hand of the captain-general and that of the senorita afterward . Her uncle when he arrives will already be enormously popular . Patriotism , which has only an intendant and a mustachioed Senor Santa Maria , will soon be left cold . " " Do you want me to come and join he choir in your park then , general ? " laughed Anthony . " If so , you can count on me for that . " " Do so by all means , " laughed Las Casas . " I shall instruct my sentries not to fire on the night when you arrive . Let your soul overflow . But we wander a little from the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am really quite serious . Would you be interested , Don Antonio , for instance in being the agent for providing the somewhat embarrassed Captain-General of Cuba withP485an independent revenue ? You might , ahem , er , participate  --  to a certain extent . I should add that you would deserve to do so for you would be providing the means for preserving intact the interests of the crown here . " " You mean , " said Anthony doing some fast thinking , " that once in Africa you would like me to continue there for a while as your confidential agent . " " Your surmise has hit the mark very closely , senor . " " I could never consider engaging in slaving as a permanent business , sir , there is no need for me to do sod and besides I do not ... " " Certainly , of course not , that is for any length of time or in the usual way . My thought was this : once arrived in Africa establish yourself at Gallego 's base and remain there long enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to get the upper hand here financially . " We will undertake to provide you ships . They will be temporarily sequestrated from the friends of Senor Santa Maria . Thus the thing will work both ways to our benefit . It will hamstring them and provideus funds to pay the garrison and equip loyal colonial forces . I should say it would require some years to bring this about , provided you can keep sending slaves . It will not matter then if we are cut off from Spain . The commercial details of the matter will be handled by Herr Meyier through our good friend the rich grocer of Regla . Any reasonable arrangement which you and Cibo might care to make with the Caxa da Consolidacion would , I am sure , be approved of at the palace . " He smiled . " You see the merit of the scheme is that the intendant and his friends will not be able to lay their hands on the root of the trouble at first . It will all be done quietly . You are not known here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's connection , if at all . We shall take care to have the cargoes landed at Santiago , say , and marched overland if necessary . And slaves now are at a premium . I should hope for six or eight cargoes a year at least . " He paused looking at Anthony earnestly , again drumming on the desk . In the great room the sunlight was already beginning to fade . " Can you give me a few men I can depend upon when the Ario-.ctatica sails ? It may be difficult to make this first seizure , in Africa , " said Anthony . " Suppose that Senor Gallego objects . " " Ah , " said the governor shrugging his shoulders , " that I admit is the rub . Frankly I can not help you there . To put a crew on the schooner and send them to Africa , I have no power . My authority ends three miles from these shores . If I carried it with a high hand and put men aboard , the cat would be out of the bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can arm you with papersp486 and nothing more . Those papers give you authority to tell the captain what to do and to attach Senor Gallego 's slaves . You must contri ve to do that and to establish yourself in Africa if you can . If this first move is protested I can simply say I am carrying out the unofficial policy of the present ministry to permit the collection of a foreign merchant 's debt . If you make use of your opportunity and establish yourself , ah , then  --  then I shall take some risks in seizing ships . Until then why should I ? Apparently I should simply be compromising myself for you . No one would believe that . " As it is now only four of us will know , and the marquis when he arrives . Indeed , I should not risk it with any Cuban . They all have local connections . I wished to see you myself before I broached the matter . I believe you can succeed in this , Don Antonio . If you do , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In any event you will be taking much the same risks just to collect your present debt . " " It will take several years out of my life , " mused Anthony . " True , and very interesting ones they may prove to be , " continue I the general . " But there  --  I would not press you . Either you will want to do this as you say for its own sake , or not at all . I can under stand that . I see by these papers , however , we are both serving the same master now  --  your oath of allegiance . I have always served my king well . The profit has not always been great . One does the best one can  --  and goes home . You will forgive me for having pressed all this upon you . I am surrounded by rascals here or incompetents . It seemed our opportunity might be mutual in several ways . Well , let us seal these and go . The senorita receives informally in the garden this afternoon . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rope a pull . At some distance the bell tinkled musically . The door opened . " Lights , Pedro , for a sealing . " Presently the lighted candles cane . " There is always something childishly fascinating about this , " said the governor as he began to soften the wafers for the seals in a little pan . The pungent smell of lit wax made him cough . Instantly before Anthony arose the library of Mr. Udney at Li vorno . He saw himself moving about there a ragged , stammering or phan with a priest 's hat under his arm . That was who he was ! I l e remembered now . He must be making his own place in the world . And now  --  he was looking at the captain-general of Cuba sealing documentsthat concerned that same orphan . He had come for them half-way across the world from the library of Mr. Udney eleven years ago . Why not gather in all that the wax might seal ? It was running now , as it were , through the general 's hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for all , Florence Udney . . . NoP 487pigtails now . . . Mrs. David Parish thank you ! Dolores , how lovely you are . In three years I might . . . in three years , who knows ? " Your Excellency , I have joined your party , " Anthony said quietly . " Good ! " said Las Casas , " all the better that you did not jump at the first glimmer of a golden hook . It is more than that , is n't it ? " " Much more , " said Anthony . " All I think . " The governor smiled and pressed down on the last seal . " Well , " said he , " since you-have joined my party , I suppose you will have no objection to joining the one going on downstairs . No ! " He laughed and put Anthony 's sealed copies back in the portfolio . The rest of these papers remain here , and with Herr Meyier . I shall myself add a confidential memorandum for the marques when he comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go down to the garden . Don Antonio  --  " he looked at Anthony fixedly . " Your Excellency ? " " I congratulate you . Permit me to introduce you to the Friends of the King . " They walked across the room together , Anthony 's heart beating fast . To his surprise , however , they did not turn toward the door . " How do you think I do as a politician ? " said the governor . " I have had to learn it here , " he grimaced . " I am not the first captaingeneralwho found himself alone in Cuba , however . Look here ! They had stopped before a full-length portrait of Don Philip IV just opposite the governor 's desk across the hall . " It might , " said Las Casas , " be a portrait of the old days here . It is a copy of Velasquez . A predecessor of mine had it hung here almost a century ago . " From the deep shadows of a black velvet curtain behind him the pale and utterly weary countenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ w ; re not there . The gold ringlets over his narrow , austere brow shone with as cold a lustre as the fishy-blue of his eyes . Disdainfully , with a smile that had nothing human about it except a hint of cruelty , he was drawing on a pair of long , thin gloves . " You see ? " said Las Casas . " It is the same king who once had a soldier executed for catching him in his arms when he fell downstairs . High treason ! He had impeded the sovereign . " A look of keen enjoyment passed over the face of the governor not unmixed with regret . " The king did not have to be a politician , " he went on . " But it has been otherwise with viceroys in Cuba . They have sometimes thought that even a way of falling downstairs without attracting attentionmight be convenient . Even a century ago . . . now ... " He put out his hand and pulled the picture toward him . It swung out like a door . A narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descended these in two turns in the darkness and came out suddenly into a tropical garden below . The garden had been there so long that it had forgotten it was in a patio . The smooth , grey stems of giant palms sprang upwards to a green clerestory above , a luminous Gothic ceiling which swam rather than rested on the cleanly curved boles of its natural pillars below , The eye lost itself in the fronded arches of palm leaves or wandered away through a maze of living columns to be reluctantly halted at last by the time-darkened walls of the palace beyond . It was the old tiltyard of Los Molinos which the genius of some unknown architect had turned into a formal paradise for the viceroys of Spain . A series of low terraces bordered with stone banisters and lined with ferns and giant cacti in green stone jars descended by regular degrees till they finally enclosed the centre of the garden . There was , a level stretch of intensely green grass and ferns from the centre of which a fountain under great pressure lifted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the secret of the place . The deep rim nels of subterranean channels murmured with a constant moaning undertoneas if the stream that had been diverted to refresh the place still softly complained . It was hard to tell whether it was the voice of the wind in the palms above or the rush of hidden water below that never ceased . It was a monotone that seemed to belong there and to be as natural as the cool shade of the giant palms themselves . " An ancient tribe of peacocks once inhabited here , " said Las Casas as they stood looking down a flight of broad Spanish steps that led to the fountain below . " The women 's dresses moving about among the trees there remind me of them . It is a pity that hoops and brocade are now going out . We shall scarcely know what to do with places like this soon I am afraid . As for the peacocks  --  they had to go . They made a noise in the morning like filing glass . But come , I see they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of the stair by a very old man of extreme Castilian gravity in a costume that might have done duty at the Escurial some decades before . Don Alonso de Guzman had been master of ceremonies at Los Molinos ( luring the administrations of four preceding captains-general , and although he was now nearly eighty , he still contrived to impress even on a garden party a certain haughty air of mouldy etiquette that was only a memory even in Spain . To this personage Anthony was now delivered by Las Casas and a round of formal introductions began . There was old Dona Mercedes , the captain-general 's mother , who sat in a wheel-chair wrapped in heavy flaps of lace . A marmoset with a face like a bearded penny peeped out over her withered breasts . Above the low hum of conversation , the sound of water and of sereP489Ives , the dry , hacking cough of the old woman and the shrill whimperingof the monkey rang out disturbingly from time to time . As vet few of the younger generation had arrived . Everybody seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meantime old Don Alonso struck his high , beribboned cane into the ground before the bishop , a sardonic , olive-faced old gentleman with a tight , churchly wig and a massive episcopal ring ; before the Comandante of Police , Colonel Jesus Blejo ; before Senor Gomez Calderon a rich planter , and Mr. James Drake , an English merchant o f much influence . The old courtier bowed with the exact degree of deference due to each while he introduced Anthony . Several officers of the garrison now began to arrive dressed in widebrimmed , straw hats with heavy , silver lace bands . These Anthony thought looked anything but military . Two or three of the foreign consuls came in with their wives . By the time Anthony had made his rounds with Don Alonso it was understood that another rich , young Englishman with letters was on his travels . This explanation of his presence seemed to have invented itself for him and he gladly acquiesced . " I suffer greatly from the dreadful humidity of Cuba , " said old Dona Mercedes , evidently touched that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How I shall survive the trip back to Spain with Don Luis only the blessed Virgin knows . His Lordship here has promised me a hair of the blessed St. Teresa in a bottle to take along . Ah , he is a comfort , that man . I am just saying what a comfort you are , Your Lordship , " she called out . The bishop came strolling over looking both saturnine and bored . " You will not forget the blessed bottle , will your ' she reminded him . " You shall have it tomorrow , " he said , and made an elaborate note of it in a black notebook with a gold cross on it . The old woman looked at him dotingly while biting the pink ear of her marmoset with her gums . " As an Englishman , Don Antonio will scarcely understand how much your kindness means to me , " she said . " Don Antonio is a good Catholic I hear , " replied the bishop . " It was he who brought the miracle-working Madonna to Regla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Anthony . " I merely arrived on the same ship . " The old woman looked at them both with a live interest now and began to chatter in an animated way about the happenings at Regla . Evidently it was the talk of the town . Through her pious exclamationsof admiration , wonder , and surprise , the bishop kept trying to pump Anthony . He walked all around the subject of the miracle likep490 a cat but he learned nothing beyond the facts that he already knew , He looked disappointed . " You see , senor , " said he after they had bowed and walked away from Dona Mercedes , " frankly , I am glad to meet you here . Let us sit down for a minute . Your name has been mentioned to me already  --  ourfriend Senor Cibo . Only this afternoon we have had : i long talk . What you say about the remarkable event at Reglafirms in every way what he has just been telling me --  " the bishop smiled blandly  --  " I am much gratified . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statues which were so thoughtfully imported will prove to he miraculous . It would be somewhat embarrassing if the age of miracles were to return by wholesale . The faith of this generation would scarcely be adequate to the occasion . I trust you appreciate my conservativeattitude , senor . What do you think ? " He leaned forward putting his long upper lip over the gold knob of his cane and stared out into the garden . " I am sure Your Lordship has nothing more unusual to anticipate , " said Anthony . " The rest of the statues which Captain Jorham is now disposing of are in no way remarkable except in price . Of course , I do not pretend to speak either with authority or inspiration , only a certain prophetic instinct as it were . " " Ah , you relieve me greatly , " sighed the bishop taking his lip off the cane . " All the ecclesiastical authorities want to do with miracles is to be reasonable about them . As it is there has been a great deal of unauthorized religious enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shepherd of my flock I feel it should be allayed . By the way , senor , you were present at a recent occasion when a French monk , whom I believe you know , interfered with the punishment of a slaves A very serious business ! " " Your Lordship seems to be very well informed of everything that goes on in Havana ! " " Very , " said the bishop . " It was also intimated to me this afternoon , with great discretion I might add , that you were expecting to travel to Africa shortly under somewhat favourable circumstances . " " Carlo should scarcely have spoken of it , " said Anthony somewhat annoyed . " Ah , do not say that , Don Antonio . You see he knew to whom he was speaking ! After all we are all of one party here . " He swept his stick around . " Under the circumstances I can even understand your sympathy for Brother Francois . You are very young yet after all . But you will also , I trust , understand my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . The civil authorities are demand ing I take some action about Brother Francois . Such things can not go on . " He paused significantly ,  |p491  " My son , it occurs to me that if you could make things comfortable for Brother Francois on your approaching voyage you would be doing him a great favour . In fact I might add that I have arranged to have him , er , transferred to the African province . The captain-general and 1 have just had a little talk . He quite understands and has suggested that I inform you myself as the matter may be somewhat of a surprise to the good monk . I understand you start soon . By the way , His Excellency would like to see you for a minute before you leave this afternoon . " He rose . " This has been most gratifying , Don Antonio ; you shall have my prayers for a smooth voyage , I assure you . " Withoutwaiting for any reply he walked away smiling . " I shall warn Brother Francois tonight , " thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then with his wife on his arm . They talked for some time . " You hail from about Dundee , do you not , Mr. Adverse ? " said the Englishman . " I think I detect certain  --  ah  --  Dundeeisms in your accent . " But there was no time to reply . The company suddenly began to gather itself together on the lawn . Those who had been strolling about tinder the trees now suddenly appeared . Old Dona Mercedes broke into a violent fit of coughing to attract notice to herself . But no one paid any attention to her . The brittle , snapping sound of the sudden opening of fans revealed several women advancing along a faint path through the ferns and palm trees . They seemed to appear suddenly out of the background of greenery and were now standing by the fountain fanning themselves , laughing and talking to those who crowded up to meet them eagerly . From the remoter vistas of the garden , where they had evidently been concealing themselves and smoking to avoid the boring preliminarieswith the bishop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . Several little wisps of blue smoke amid the shrubbery discovered their former hiding places . But all this Anthony caught out of the side of his eye . For in the centre of the group of senoritas by the fountain was Dolores . He lost no time in hurrying forward himself , and it seemed to him a particular act of grace on the part of Las Casas that he rescued him from the formal clutches of Don Alonso to present him to Dolores . " Here , senorita , " said he , " is a young gentleman whom I believe you have seen before . " He seemed to be enjoying the slight evidence : ) f confusion in both of them which marked his words . " Don Antonio has brought us letters from important friends . " This was evidently for the benefit of the young Cubans who were standing near waiting their turn somewhat impatiently . P492 Anthony was aware of a sweetly modulated voice with a surprising depth of tone saying something to the effect that Cuba was honour by the presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green with something in bright scarlet that fell down from her shoulders into long fringes . On account of the light which seemed to him to emanate from her garments their exact outline remained vague . He looked up to see her dark eyes smiling at him gravely while she manipulated her fan . A faint perfume slept in the lazy breeze she evoked . " It is I who am greatly and unexpectedly honoured , " he managed to reply not very happily . Then they both smiled at the immense gravity of this formal exchange  --  as if their meeting in the cathedral had already put them far beyond that . He saw the corners of her lips twitch a little with amusement . " Have you brought along with you the charming lady who accompanied you this afternoon at the christening , Don Antonio , la inglesa ? ' I She looked at him half mockingly over her fan . " I regret , senorita , " he began . " Ah , that is a great disappointment , " she said , " frankly my curiosity was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English cabal. leros were accompanied by duennas . Come , , enlighten us , senor , wh was she ? I hope you have not trusted yourself alone here ! " A titte ran through the group of girls behind her , some of whom Anthony now remembered having seen in the church . They looked at him arch awaiting his explanation . " You do my moral character no great compliment , senorita , but you underrate the strength of the temptation it finds here . Can you blame me for needing protection ? And besides it was I who was protecting the lady from the ardent caballeros of Cuba . " As a matter of fact , " he hurried on making the most of having turned the tables slightly , " I was merely showing the wife of a Yankee captain the epitaphs and tombs of Havana . She is a great authority on cemeteries and visits them all over the world . " The explanation aroused a gratifying interest . It was plain Mrs. Jorham and her cavalier had caused a good deal of comment . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented to the other senoritas . The Cubans and several young officers now crowded up . The talk became general and extremely animated . Evidently these garden parties of the Senorita Dolores were affairs of the younger generation . There could be no doubt that they belonged to her . She moved about here and there , always faithfully followed ; the object of much ingenious attention , and with a dignity , a charm , and a serene enjoyment of her position which at once dominated everybodyand yet put them at their ease.  |p493Even  Don Alonso recognized this . He withdrew quietly , accompanyingthe chair of Dona Mercedes which was wheeled off somewhere , leaving the light chatter and laughter of the group by the fountainuninterrupted by her cough . She and Don Alonso took coffee alone and exchanged the court gossip of previous reigns for hours at a time . In the garden coffee and light confections were served by orderlies of the Andalusian regiment in the garrison . Anthony secured some cakes representing a Jew in the flames . He perched them on the back of a stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes of Dolores . She nodded and he came forward bowing to her cavalier . He , however , still followed . " May I not have the honour ? " Anthony said to her , pointing to the bench . He smiled at her partner . " I hope , senor , you will permit me to intrude without offence . You have often the valued privilege of drinking coffee at Los Molinos , while I , I remain here for only a few days . I ask a great sacrifice I know , but imagine the memory you will be conferring . " " If the senorita permits , " said the young cavalryman who was with her , half hopeful she would not . " Tomorrow , Don Esteban , I promise you . Don Antonio departs so soon , " she said . " You would not be cruel ! " She tapped the young soldier with her fan . The lieutenant bowed with more courtesy than enthusiasm and went off , to light a cigarro philosophically . Dolores and Anthony sat down on the bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat my cruel words , senor , " she said . " You are decidedly not in need of a duenna . Don Esteban is not easy to put off . You see I know . " His hand shook as he poured out her coffee . " Are you really so much moved , Don Antonio ? " Her fan folded itself together softly on her lap . She sat back and watched him , studyinghis face . " Thou seest , senorita , " he said boldly , looking up . The blood rushed to his face as he looked at her . Her shoulders rose and fell deeply . At last she sipped her coffee taking her eyes , from his . He picked up the cup and drank from it where she had put her lips . " He burns , " said Dolores picking up one of the little cakes laughingly . " Would you have no mercy for a poor devil in the fire then ? " asked Anthony . " It is true I must go in a few days . Tell me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . I believe you were glad to see me , that we did truly see each other when we first met this afternoon . All my life I have been looking for you and when I looked up , standingp494 there by the pillar , I thought  --  I dared to think  --  that at last I was no longer alone . Just to have found you , just to know you are alive .. " " Be careful , " she whispered , " the intendant is coming this way . " They waited , sipping their coffee together while a dark , middle-aged nian with a jewelled court sword passed close to the bench where the were sitting . He bowed deeply to Dolores and gave Anthony a keen glance . " He knows he is not welcome here , " she said . " Go on , Don Antonio , you were saying something , I believe . " " Was I , does it really interest you ? " he asked . He leaned forward suddenly with his napkin drooped over the cake dish and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do not crush it , " she said at last . Her eyes opened widely upon him . " Yes !  --  I shall keep this cake , " she said . She took it from the plate with her other hand . " Now you must let me fan myself , senor ! Remember where we are ! " He sat back reluctantly trying to clear his eyes of a dazzling golden light . The muscles in his throat relaxed again . " Could I not see you somewhere else than here ? Only for five minutes , but alone ? " She shook her head doubtfully . " It would be all but impossible . " " All but ? " he said . She laughed at him now . His disappointment was so grim . " You are serenaded , senorita , I am told . Is it only the Cubans , the Friends of the King , ' who are to be consoled ? Ah ! Sorrow of the Flame , Dolores de la Fuente , por Dios , you are well named ! " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She brought the fan up so that only her wide forehead with the pale , golden ring lets curling over the delicate hollows in her temples , and her eyes dark as violets at twilight looked at him like a vision . He remembered her that way ; he remembered her always . It was like the forehead of the face in the miniature . " Dolores , " he said , " I do not burn . Do not think that . I love yon with my soul . " He heard her gasp . They sat for almost a minute and both were thinking the same thing . Across the garden they saw that General Las Casas and someoneelse were strolling toward them . " It would be very difficult , " she said suddenly . " There are many who come to serenade in the outer park but my windows open into this garden . No one could climb the patio wall . . . " " But if they did , " he said . " Quien sabe ! " she replied . " Here is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hair , senorita , that at least to remember you by . I beg you . . . " " Ah ! your pardon , Don Antonio , " said Las Casas . " It is really painful to interrupt under the circumstances , " he bowed to Dolores , but I must detain you a minute . How do you get on with Englishmen , senorita ? " he said . " Very well , Your Excellency . Indeed , " said she , putting her hands behind her head , and looking up at him from the bench with her head thrown back in a charming defiance , while her fingers seemed to rearrangeher high , silver comb  --  " indeed , I wish they did not have to leave Havana so soon . " " So ! " said Las Casas , taking a pinch of snuff . " lay , senorita , I am afraid we shall have to disappoint you . " " Adios , then , Don Antonio , " said Dolores with an exaggerated regret as she stood just finishing rearranging her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he bent over it , in the folds of their fingers as they met , he felt the petals of a rose . " But will I ever see her again ? " he wondered . P496THE TEMPORARY SEQUESTRATION O F T H E " A RIOSTATICA " UPON my word , senor , I am afraid I have some bad news for you , " said Las Casas to Anthony as they watched Dolores walk away . She disappeared down a path which Anthony did not fail to mark . Now and then , before she vanished entirely , he could still catch sight of her black fan waving through the palms . He turned to find that he had kept the captain-general waiting . " This is Don Jesus Blejo , el comandante de policia en Habana , " continued Las Casas with a slight twist of amusement still visible in his smile . " The had news , under the circumstances , is that you will be leaving Havana about sunrise tomorrow morning , Don Antonio . " Despite himself Anthony could not entirely conceal his surprise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and biting his lips . " Por Dios ! It is high time you were on your way , I think , " ex claimed the governor with a slight gesture of annoyance . " Still , " said he softening , " I do not blame you . But we can not even for so charming a reason delay . You may have noticed that the intendant was here this afternoon ? " Anthony nodded , trying to look as if he cared . " He came to complain of the detention of the Gallegos ' schooner by the port authorities . To preserve appearances I was forced ' to give poor Don Jesus here a thorough rating . " He turned to the man who stood by rather uncomfortably with a look of surprised chagrin still on his face . " I trust you fully understand that now , colonel . " " Since Your Excellency has been pleased to explain , " he said . Las Casas looked extremely annoyed . " You see what subterfuges I am put to , " he said striking his sword " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to promise it , and even to pretend surprise that she had ever been held . We have only a few hours in which to act . It must be tonight or not at all . I have given orders to Don Jesus to have ten men and a boat in reach ness at the Maestranza from midnight on . Fortunately , due to hi , . loyalty and care , you can rely upon those he will pick for duty . As soon after midnight as possible you will row out and put yourself in possession of the schooner . Allow no one from her to return to shore.  |p497After  you have once served your papers on the captain prevent all communication . You should be out of the harbour by sunrise . Make out to sea as soon as possible . The police will leave you and row in somewhere near Jibacoa . After that , senor , it depends on you . I wish you luck . " He twirled his moustache and looked at Anthony a little doubtfully . " You have my word , Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthony . " Bueno ! " said Las Casas . " This is a little more hurried than we had expected but it may turn out for the best . The intendant when he inquires tomorrow will simply be informed that the Ariostatica has been released as he demanded . He will suppose that the captain has lost no time in getting under way . And in that supposition he will be correct . " He twirled his moustache again with more assurance now . " You will be wanting a few hours to make your personal arrangements for the voyage , Don Antonio . Arm yourself , " he added significantly . " But you will also have to return to the palace tonight to receive the final papers for the sequestration ; the release to the port authorities in due form . I shall have my personal secretary make them out this evening . Return about eleven o'clock if possible . They will be ready then and I shall sign them : You will find Don Esteban at work in the big hall , the aquarium , ' " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ? Ah , si ! a pass for the palace tonight , of course ! What ! There is something ? I thought I had covered it all . " " Not quite all , sir , " said Anthony hesitating a little . " Ah , excuse us for a moment , Don Jesus , " said Las Casas . He and Anthony took a few turns up and down the path alone . The comandantestood waiting by the bench . The governor at last gave a relieved laugh . " I thought you were going to withdraw at the last or make some final costly stipulation , " said he . " I am used to that . " " No , no , " replied Anthony , " I would not bargain with you for this . I appeal to you as a man of understanding and sentiment . I am going  --  who knows to what ? A half hour only , Your Excellency . Perhaps never again  --  quien sabe ? " " Ah , quien sabe ? " echoed Las Casas . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority there you know , senor . " Anthony opened his hand and showed him the rose . " Madre de Dios ! you are a dangerous man . It is high time you were on your way . But it shall be your pass . A half hour then  --  fifteen minutes if you have a bad voice . My windows also look into this patio . " Anthony spoke earnestly again for a turn or two . The governor broke out laughing aloud and finally nodded . " But I shall give ordersp498to search the guitar for lethal weapons , " he said . " That will at least save the comandante 's face  --  and perhaps a quarrel between you . I le is a man of literal duty you know , a Basque . By the way , you will treat him with marked courtesy . He is important here in the scheme of things . " " What is the least which will not insult him , sir ? " " Not less than a hundred dollars I hazard , " smiled Las Casas , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is somewhat nettled at having been transferred from his regiment to take over the police . Pride  --  you see ? " " It is a great pleasure to be associated in this enterprise with so gallant a soldier , " said Anthony as they rejoined the comandante by the bench . " His Excellency has been speaking of your invaluable services here , Don Jesus , I am honoured . " The man 's jacket bulged slightly about the breast as he bowed with a sudden and very marked cordiality . " I am at your disposal , senor . It is but for His Excellency  --  and you  --  to command . " Las Casas was secretly much pleased , too . The police were his chic reliance next to the garrison . " Have passes made out to the palace for Don Antonio and his servanttonight , " said the governor --  " and a guitar . " He smiled whimsically . " If the holders of the pass should be found during the evening in the patio . . . I trust you will not be alarmed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact I have nothing to do with it . " " Except to bind me to your service with tender bonds , " said Anthonybowing deeply . " Ah ! that remains to be seen , " said the governor . " As you say , quien sabe ? And now adios , Don Antonio . I wish you well in several ways . Do not let the moonlight delay you too long . That is all . Don Jesus will accompany you now as far as Regla . Make what haste you can . Do not forget that other matter , colonel , " he called after them . The soldier turned and saluted again . Looking back from the top of the steps as they left the garden Anthony saw the Captain-General of Cuba standing by the fountain smoking a cigar . An hour and a half later , after a breathless drive and dash across the harbour , he broke in on Carlo on the veranda with the news . But Carlo refused to be hurried . In the brief tropical twilight lie was comfortably having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audibly . " Sit down and have some pompano , " he said . " The most delicious of fish . The only one I really care for . Some fried yams ? Yes !  |p499I  insist ! What is a mere voyage to Africa compared to a supper like this ? Ah ! What you will miss ! Tomorrow is the dinner I have prepared for you and Father Trajan in celebration of the miracle . And now you will be at sea instead ! Well , well , you must go well prepared . Now let me show you something , since you are going to Africa , that land of servants . Sit here and drink your wine . It is not necessary to move now merely because you are going on a journey . Cheecha , send Tambo , and Eunice , and three bright boys . Also rouse Senor Rodriguez . Fly now ! " In a few minutes the various persons white and black who had been sent for appeared . Leaning back in his chair with a glass of Malaga in his hand Cibo gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the veranda and repacked by the slave girls . He had several other receptacles , iron-bound and provided with heavy locks , carried up by the black boys . From a list which he wrote out by the light of a candle he began to fill these with such a variety of articles , clothing , food , private trading goods , luxuriesand necessities , that Anthony was amazed . " When you have boarded the schooner tonight and taken possession hang a green light in the shrouds and I shall see that all this is sent out to you immediately . The boys will be waiting with the boat laden at the wharf . Have these chests stowed where you can watch them . Remember you are going to be moving from now on in a world of thieves . You are going to steal men , and in return you can expect them to steal everything from you they can . Do not waste any time thinking about the morality or philosophy of it . Use locks . I shall send you everything you can need for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our trading account . It is fortunate that Moses has deliveredall your linen suits . You will need them . The Rio Pongo alternatesbetween a Turkish bath and a furnace . Sometimes the nights are cool . " For an hour Cibo continued to talk of nothing but slaving and Africa . He gave off a world of particulars and sound practical advice . He settled the last details of how he would act as agent for dispatching further ships if Anthony was successful . He drank two bottles of wine and described the Gallego establishment on the Rio Pongo near Bangalang , the tribes surrounding it , and the , half-caste Mohammedans who came clown in caravans from the interior to trade . He even touched on the rising opposition to slavery in the British House of Commons and its possible effect on the trade in general . At the end of his discourse , for it could be called nothing less , he presented Anthonywith two cases both of English make . The large one contained a pair of splendidly mounted pistols and the smaller a set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Use these , " said he . " When you begin to look and act like a native it is time to leave Africa . I give you two , at the most three years , That is longer than usual . The blue medicine chest there is mostly full of cinchona bark for the fever . I will nail directions inside . Fol  --  low them or you will die . Did it ever occur to you that you can die ? No ? Well , you can . In fact you will . Delay it . Immortality should be shunned with intelligent forethought whether it is inevitable or not , Quien sabe ! Cheecha , another bottle of wine . " In the meantime the moon was flooding the patio with a deeper and deeper light . All the ropes were on the chests . For good luck Anthonytook a last look at his own with the sextant in it . He settled the little madonna deeper into some soft things under his great-coat and wedged her in . How curious that she was going to Africa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near he would have taken a peep at her . But he was in no mood for quips and raillery now . It had been hard enough to listen to Cibo at all with his own head ( lancing with Dolores , moonlight , and the adventure of the night yet before him . Only the man 's immense kindness and the inherent wisdom of what he had to say had held him . And now  --  now it was time to go , He sent for Juan who appeared grinning in his new servant 's clothes , " Si , si , senor , I am all ready . Si , I have the guitar . " Anthony wrapped his boat-cloak about him and turned to Cibo to say good-bye , Then he remembered something . He undid the bundle of soiled clothes he had worn to the tailor 's that morning and from it took his watch . He gave Cheecha the chameleon on the little gold chain . It kept coming up between her breasts when she hung it about her neck , which was probably the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time she clutched a few coins he had given her . Her stream of blessings and thanks made him ashamed . After all she was not the woman he had seen in the dream . That was something else . Cibo laughed at his serious face . " Leaving a chameleon at a girl 's breast is nothing to worry about . Ha , Toni , what a tender conscience we have ! A glass now . SomethingI have saved to the last . " He brushed some cobwebs off a small , green bottle with a reverentialgesture and carefully filled two tumblers . It was a very old and mellow Montrachet . " May whatever gods there be go with you , " he said . They clinked . Cibo walked down to the dock with Anthony . He was to cross again in the fast little boat . The dark bodies of the rowers glistened in the moonlight . Someone was patting a tune drowsily . " Do you understand that I am grateful , Carlo ? " asked Anthony . It was hard to tell now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the dock . Cibo drew in his sash very tight . He suddenly I , eked younger with his faun-like face smooth under the moon . " All that is nothing , " he said . " We could not help being friends . Remember me , your philosopher in exile . " " Adios , Carlo . Farewell , farewell ! " " You should have waited for the supper tomorrow night , a great supper ! I will send along some of the wine . Drink to . . . " Carlo 's voice called after them as the boat flashed out from the dock . The swift click of the oars and the rush of water drowned his tones in the distance . The black rowers grinned and pulled together for the tip that was so soon due . Anthony turned around and waved his white hat . It was a miraculous night . Havana harbour was one blaze of silver and the moon straight overhead . The city lay before them twinkling with a thousand little lights . Juan unslung his guitar . They fairly flashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rail . The rollicking voice of the young Spaniard made the six negroes pull as one man . At every stroke Anthony felt the light , soft air cool against his cheeks . " Dolores , Dolores ! " He had forgotten all about the Ariostatica for the moment . Before his eyes burned a vision of the pale face of the Spanish girl . It was not merely a vague pictorial thought of her . As he looked across the molten silver of the bay toward Los Molinos an actual reflectedimage of her face seemed to be cast upon the water just ahead of the boat . The rich , full tones of her voice sounded in his ears . For a while she possessed him . When his brain cleared again he found himself still swinging to the rhythm of the oars and Juan 's barcarole while Havana suddenly sprang up before him much nearer than it had been before . The lights in the harbour seemed to have shifted . He took a deep breath of the warm salt air . Tonight belonged to him and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was , he felt , the captain of events for the first time in his life . Things had come his way in Havana remarkably well . It would be his part to continue to make them behave that way in the future . His last monitor had disappeared ; had been left , talking , on the dock at Regla . He was glad to have left Cibo . He liked him . He was grateful . Yes , but he was glad to be sitting in this boat bound on his own affairs with the tiller in his hand . The only one with him now was a servant.Bueno , that was as it should be . And he would take and drive the Ariostatica to Africa . How he slid not know . But he felt sure of it , sure of himself as he sat there . Cibo 's wine gave just enough of a tinge of madness to turn the city ahead and the harbour into something a little better than even the moonlight could confer . It was a slightly mad , transfigured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all good , all tinglinglyP502 vivid , that lay before him . It had no end . In it one was immortal It was impossible to fail . The pleasures of it were as infinite as one 's capacity to enjoy . It was hard , and youthful and real . And yet- is was beautiful and dreamful ; it was moonlight and mad Music over the water . He sat up with an intense sureness and took active charge . The boat , which had been driving a little out of its course , he set directly on the water-gate lights . He stopped Juan and slowed the rowers t a steadier but more time devouring speed . The Warnpanoag , he ii ticed , had slipped her mooring and was riding far down the harbour . So Captain Jorham was on his way . He must have sold all his stilt uary . Well , he had learned much from the Warpanoag he could use now . Adios to her ! Adios to everything ! They glided into the slip by the water gate and he gave a gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ babble of African approval and well-wishes seemed to waft him up the steps of the quay . Two min utes later he was being whirled through the dim , narrow streets of the old city toward Los Molinos again . Once beyond the walls of the town they began to trot swiftly and more swiftly along the straight , white road awash with mad shadows where the palm trees flaunted and rustled their lofty double row o f seething plumes down an infinite avenue . There was a thin , gauzy mist blowing by here in the valley ; there was a hint of northern cool ness , the smell of heavy dew on grass and leaves , and a blurred-glistening of green things in the foggy moonlight . The horses broke into a gallop thinking they were going home . They bolted . To the ex pectation of happiness ahead was now added the exhilaration of speed . A divine recklessness rode with them . The tenor voice of Juan lifted itself in staves of some Andalusian love song that rang out over the vacant plantations like the chorus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and howled in the distance . At the open doorways of huts dark figures outlined in the orange glow from within watched them streak past . The driver at last brought up his team beside a roadside fountain . " He will founder them if he lets them drink now , " said Juan . " Let him , " replied Anthony . " As long as we get to the gardens I do not care . " They sat listening to the beasts gulping and breathing and to the fall of the spout . A streak of moonlight fell full on a little slide of water that came down a steep slope of fern and moss-covered rocks just above the trough . In the shady nook by the road everything but the clear space by this spring was in shadow . Their eyes naturally came to rest on the brilliant little waterfall as if it were a piece of miniature landscape illuminated . P503It was only for a few seconds , but as Anthony watched this weird little Niagara that seemed to be leaping forever out of a tropical elfland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snake glided down to the brink of a still pool and began to drink . Under the moon its brilliant scarlet was turned to dark amber . It was so delicate in all its motions , so graceful , and so utterly wild that there was not the slightest hint of anything sinister about it . Its tongue like black , forked-lightning flickered into the silver water making all but invisible ripples , and the moon glinted on its small eye . Suddenly , when one of the horses blew loudly on the surface of the font just below , it was gone . He had watched it without complications as Adam might have seen the first serpent in Paradise before the fall . It had , he felt , given an expression and a meaning to the tropical night in a language that lies behind words . Juan proved to be no Cassandra . The tough little horses did not founder . Ten minutes later they were at Los Molinos . A glare of candles in the centre bay of the front windows of the palace showed that the secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven o'clock . In spite of the pass the sentinel on duty was obstinate . It was late , and he looked at them , but especially at the guitar , with profound suspicion . He insisted on searching the instrument . A sergeant came but he could not read . It was finally necessary to send for the comandante himself . While they waited Juan retuned his strings and groaned . He was afraid he had lost key . Finally Don Jesus appeared and the gates were opened . As they went up the broad stairs to the Hall of the Governors Anthonytook the occasion to press into the hand of the comandante " the least sum which would not insult his honour . " Evidently Don Jesus carried about him some receptacle for such contingencies , for the roll of gold pieces disappeared , internally , as it were . It neither clinked nor bulged upon his person . Except for a slightly more familiar and affable manner , he remained exactly as he had been before . One eyelid , one epaulette , and a shoulder , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drooped in that direction and he limped slightly . Anthonywondered if it was on that side that he carried gold . Don Jesus had evidently expected Juan to remain in the vestibule , but he made no protest at his not doing so . " When you have finished , senor , you will find me waiting below , " said he . " If possible we should be at the dockyard in two hours at least . Dawn is early still , and Don Esteban has already taken longer with those papers than we expected . I will , if necessary , arouse His Excellency to sign them , but I trust you will be through before he retires . All is ready at the water front . I made final arrangementsP504 on returning from Reg-la some hours ago . " He threw open the great door for them , and excusing himself , went downstairs again . The secretary in the alcove looked up and nodded as they came in . He introduced himself a little nervously . " It will take at least half an hour longer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the making of three copies which consumes so much time . They must all be original to take the seal . I am sorry to delay you . Will you be good enough to sit down for a while ? The chairs are not very comfortable , I know . " He made a grimace and shifted himself un easily looking somewhat surprised at Juan and the guitar . Then lie snuffed the candles and resumed hastily . Anthony thanked him and seated himself and Juan on two chairs flanking the large portrait of Don Philip IV . The sound of the secretary 's pen and the tread of the sentry below were the only sounds in the great apartment . Except for the bright lights on the desk , where Don Esteban bent over his papers intent on rapid and accurate copying , and a dim sconce by the door , the rest of the room was in a flux of moonlight and the black , moving shadows of the palms outside . " To all officers , servants , and ships ' commanders and to all loyal subjects whomsoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the good ship Ariostatica of our port of Havana in Cuba . . . " scraped the secretary 's quill for the third time that evening . Quietly opening the door which the portrait concealed , Anthony and Juan disappeared down the dark , little stairs behind it . Under the moon the shaded patio seemed to have suffered an unearthlychange from the garden of the afternoon before . Long pencils of silver light stole down through its palm-fronded ceiling , turning the court into a kind of dream-forest where pools of white mist gathered in the hollows of its paths . Indeed , the fountain in the centre remained the only familiar landmark . Anthony had hoped to find some windows with lights in them . But beyond the thicket of palms , on every side the dark walls of the palace loomed without a break of gleam . He thought he knew on which side her apartments lay  --  in the direction of the path which she had taken that afternoon . But he could not be sure . He and Juan went as far as the fountain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only a few fireflies winking here and there , Well , he must risk it . P 505 " Sing , Juan  --  your best now ! " " The lady is beautiful , senor , you say ? " " Lovely as the night , " said Anthony with a catch in his voice and trembling with eagerness . " This then ! " said Juan . The strings began a low prelude . Then the pleading tenor of the young sailor suddenly filled the old tilt-yard of Los Molinos with an even more ancient ballad . In the middle of the second chorus Juan suddenly stopped . They both waited . A light in a double window above a balcony flashed out in the wall . Outside the tread of the sentry had stopped . They could feel the whole place listening . Someone , Anthony felt sure , had come out on the balcony . He ran back up the steps to look and caught the gleam of moonlight on gold epaulettes . Las Casas was standing on the balcony . Ah , he had thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing again . Suppose after all she should give no sign ! How the governor would laugh at him ! There was another light now . But not here , not so near the roof . Juan had stopped again . Anthony stood listening. othing but his own blood throbbing . Not a sound or a sign from her . Then at the other end of the patio he heard a faint clapping of hands . He dashed down the steps and taking the guitar from Juan tried to pick his way as nearly as he could along the path over which Dolores had vanished that afternoon . Presently he saw a light as if from one candle in a room on the second floor . He came out of the palms against the eastern wall of the patio abruptly . There was a ( lark gate with a heavy , wrought-iron grille just before him . Above that shone the dim glow of the window . Someone was standing there . He could just see her . She was in white with something dark over her hair . Ile looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The light tapping of a fan on the windowsill answered him . " Senorita , " he whispered , " I came to say good-bye and to thank mu for the rose . " " Is it really yourself , Don Antonio ? Where did you find your voice ? I have another rose in my hair . Sing again and I will make it little snowstorm of the petals for you . " He came close under the wall and looking tip saw her bare arm holding out something over his head . A few white petals floated down like tired moths upon him . Like a beggar he held up his hat for more . " You are already well paid , " she whispered . " No more without another song . " He heard her laugh again . " Ah , Dolores , for the love of God , do not tease me now . Thou knowest I have left my singing voice by the fountain . Roses are not enough tonight . "  |p506  " You despise my flowers then ? " she said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . " Come down ! " he whispered . As if to mock him she let the flower fall onto his breast . He caught it to him and began to plead with her . A hundred en dearing names which he did not seem to have known before leapt from his lips . If she would only come down to him , come down , only for an instant ! " Dolores , Dolores ! Do you not know the few minutes we might have with each other in this life are passing . I must go to the other side of the world tonight . Now ! In only a few seconds I must go . Will you only stand there ? Come down , Sorrow of the Flame , do not let my heart die when it is so young . Dolores , Dolores ! " He kept whispering her name . Then his voice broke . In the silence that followedhe heard her catch her breath sharply above him . After all he would have to go then without . . . but she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tell him to sing . . . " God ! was that all then ? After all she . . . he leaned against the wall weakly. " . . . they will think you are still by the fountain then . That will give us a few moments . . . " Reprieved then ! " . . . when you come back I shall be at the little gate below . Hurry ! " The candle in the room above went out . He picked up the guitar and dashed hack to Juan . As he stumbled back once more over the little path the voice by the fountain rang out again and went on . She was standing behind the grille in the gate . Her face was outlined iii a frame of iron leaves . He put his hands through the tracery and clasped them behind her head , drawing her toward him softly . Only her weight resisted him . For a long minute he kissed her on the mouth . After a while she unclasped his hands . What moved him most was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands sought her through the grille again but she laughed a little and caught him by the wrists . " Anthony ! " she said , still holding him as if pleading for a respite  --  he could feel her trembling  --  " you are wearing the wrong kind of sleeve links . See they are pearls ! " She held his wrists up in a ray of moonlight . " I should send you away . " " Is it so terrible then ? " he asked anxiously . " Tell me , tell me what have I done ? " She came closer again as if she thought he might leave . Presently she was explaining to him with her cheek against his own . P507 " Do n't you know that when a caballero 's lady is away from him only carnelians are worn ? It is a sign that his heart bleeds . Pearls mean that the innocent one is near . " She giggled . " Mine do not lie then . " " Were you so sure as that ? " she exclaimed pretending to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , only my soul dared to hope . And now tell me , tell me for once and all . Was I wrong ? " " Thou knowest , " she said and clung to him . " Promise you will not forget me , Dolores . If I never see you again , even if you know that I am lost , if you are married and I can never even speak to you again , you will not forget that we love each other ? If our lips can never say it again , still we shall know . Say it is so . Say , at least , that we can go on remembering . Tell me that if I ever can come to you , you will still be there . " He kissed her passionately . " If you can , " she said , and looked up at him with the resignation of love in her face . She hid against his breast  --  " if you ever can . " They stood for a minute as close as they could , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid , " she whispered , " I am afraid it will always be like this . " She reached up and touched the grille that separated them . He cried out and caught her hands to him again , kissing them . Just then they heard a warning whistle from the fountain . " You must go ! " She thrust his hands out . " Dolores , I will never see you again ! " " No , no , " she exclaimed , " my soul will come back to me ! " He heard a key grate in the lock . The grille swung open and she was on his breast . For a moment the world died to them conclusively . They had abandoned it and taken refuge in each other 's arms . The low , shrill whistle of Juan revived time again . They stood with it ringing in their ears  --  that keen doom ! He cried out an incoherentprotest . " Hush ! " she said . She kissed him and broke away . He heard the gate clash softly behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grille again she had gone . " Senor , " said the tense voice of Juan , " senor ! " Anthony groaned . " The governor has sent for you twice . He is coming down the steps now himself . Hurry ! " They rushed back to the fountain . Someone was sitting . on the bench smoking a cigar . But to Anthony 's great relief it was not the governor but Don Jesus . " His Excellency has signed the papers and has been waiting to see you , " the man said a little grimly . " I trust you will be able to explain to him your presence here ? I am responsible , you know , for seeingPP508 that no intrusion occurs even by favoured persons ! " Don Jesus looker ) considerably chagrined and eyed Juan in particular with obvious doubt . " I shall take the entire responsibility on myself , " Anthony hastened to say . The man was obviously nettled . " On account of my immediate departure His Excellency has been particularly generous tonight . There were potent reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will not ask me to explain ! " Don Jesus bowed a little coldly but managed to smile . " Permit me to congratulate you on your remarkable voice , " he said . He still looked puzzled about something . They mounted the stairs together with Juan behind them . Suddenly , from the direction in which they were going , it became evident that Don Jesus could know nothing of the private stairs . " So that was why he was angry and perplexed , " thought Anthony . Indeed , they went out by the big gate . The comandante glared at the sentry angrily . " Your man had nothing to do with my entrance , " said Anthony . " On my honour ! Set your mind at rest . " Don Jesus looked instantly much relieved and nodded . " Very well then , " said he . " Senor , I shall wait for you here . We should now be at the dockyard . " Anthony received the papers from Don Esteban who was waiting . He was somewhat more deferential than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  he looked at a paper methodically  --  " as good luck and as much favour elsewhere as you have found in Havana . " " Convey my profound gratitude and assurance of devotion to I1 is Excellency , " said Anthony . The formal little Spaniard wrote it down . Then he delivered the papers to Anthony , took a receipt and bowed . " Buenas noches , senor . " " Buenas noches . " Now he was whirling back again along the road to the city beside Don Jesus with Juan on the box . The moon was far west now . It was after three o'clock when the hoofs of their horses echoed under the ancient stone arches of the Maestranza . Don Jesus was no romanticist . He had arrested Brother Francois in the garden at Reg-la some hours before with as little compunction as one removes a snail from a flower . He was a Basque , and could any other European have been introduced to what went on inside his head , he would have been amazed at how absolutely four-square and literal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was thisp509which made him such a magnificent policeman . His arrangements were always almost perfect . They included and took into considerationeverything " as is . " Had he also been endowed with a little imaginationhe might possibly have become a dictator . But he was not , so endowed . Hence , he was merely comandante of gendarmes for GeneralLas Casas ; hence , the unexpected was to him enormously puzzling . Why , for instance , had a peaceable parish priest like Father Trajan smitten four of his best bully boys full sore with the stump of an oar last evening when he had arrested Brother Francois in the garden ? And why had Brother Francois taken the oar from Father Trajan and thrown it away ? How silly ! He had pondered upon this on the drive from Los Molinos sitting next to the young senor who had entered the patio at the palace apparently through the wall . Altogether it had been a confusing night . He would be glad when it was over . The governor , he thought , had laughed at him  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserted dockyards of the Maestranza looked a bit weary under a sinking moon . Indeed , no building in the New World is so heavy with the futility of the past as the Maestranza . With a wisp of harbour mist drifting through its squat belfry that had tolled the passing of the treasure flotas of Spain , it seemed now in the silence of the tropical night as if Fate were withdrawing her last skein of lucky thread from the eye of a broken needle . Only an occasional stray waif of the royal Spanish navy came here now to refit amid curses out of the doubtful pickings of the past . The deserted dockyard sloped down to vacant quays piled high with pyramids of whitewashed cannonballs and verdigrised cannon cast long ago from moulds that no longer gave birth to anything . In these guns rats nested , squeaking in the sterile wombs of thunder . Silent rope walks , and towering erections for weaving cordage swung like tattered spider webs against the stars . The watchmen slumbered . Here and there the bow of some abandoned and despairing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reek of low tide , festering pitch , and rotting teak filled the nostrils of Anthony as they threaded the mazes of this nautical cemetery where the bones of a monarchy obtruded from the slime . At the foot of a flight of broad , stone stairs glimmered a single lanternthat marked the presence of their waiting boat . It proved to be a large one rowed by eight manacled negroes . Its passengers were six bare-footed gendarmes in broad , cocked hats , and Brother Francois , who lay bound in the stern sheets . Anthony exclaimed when he saw him , an exclamation half of indignantpity and half of self-reproach , for in the excitement of his departureand the absorbing events of the hours which had followed thep510 garden party at Los Molinos he had forgotten all about Brother Francois . So the bishop had been as good as his word ! And he , Anthony had forgotten to warn Brother Francois . He reproached himvel t bitterly . If it had not been for Dolores . . . ! Now it was too late The best he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monk ' : bonds , and he would not even do that till they were well out from the dockyard and rowing down the harbour . Cock-crow had already begun . What a paean it was this morning ! Brother Francois looker 1 at him and smiled . There were red welts on his wrists . The Ariostatica lay across the harbour about a mile away . The barge drifted down upon her easily , swept along by the fast ebbing tide " Senor , " said Don Jesus , " from now on I am at your disposal Those are my orders . " Anthony stood up and looked at the beautiful schooner that now loomed up before him like the vague outline of a great swan . His regrets vanished in excitement . He took command jubilantly and with assurance . They stopped rowing and drifted down upon the ship silently . It was one of those breathless few minutes where much depends upon the simple negative of not being heard . The shadow of the graceful slaver stretched out monstrously in the dawn as if the black purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rored in the quiet harbour . Anthony looked down into the clear water and drew back again with a start which he could not entirely control . Lying perfectly motionless scarcely a fathom beneath the surface with its sinister head pointed toward the stern of the Ariostatica was an immense hammerhead shark . It rose slowly toward them as if to see what of interest for it the drifting boat might contain . The sickle curve of its dorsal fin broke rippling from the water . It nosed the planks softly , sending a slight tremor through the barge so that all within it trembled as if the water of the bay itself had transferred to them the message of an earthquake . For a moment they could even see its long , grey flanks disappearing into the belly-pallor beneath . The brown , expressionless walnuts of its eyes on their protruding , transverse sticks looked at the boat and were satisfied . Some promising picture of sharkful hope must have mirrored itself in those black lozenges of pupils for the great fish sounded and turned with a slight phosphorescent glimmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had one brief and sufficient glance into its utterly utilitarian mouth . Don Jesus crossed himself automatically and nervously motioned to the crew to give way . The sound of the oars brought someone to the taffrail of the schooner . The man did not seem to realize at first that they intended to board . Only when they glided up and made fast top 511the small boat drifted against the schooner 's stern did he suddenly straighten himself up . " Nola , what do you want ? " he said sleepily . Then for the first time he became aware of the armed men in the barge and half turned as if to give an alarm . Anthony rose in the stern sheets and covered him with a pistol . The man 's jaw fell . The fellow gaped stupefied at the little circle of the muzzle . The gendarmes swarmed in over the stern and secured the sleepy watch . Except for the pad of bare feet on the empty decks of the schooner there had been no sound . A few sparks were coming from the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets of the barge with the shark just a few feet below and behind him . The slaves ' manacles rattled a little as they passed about a single cigar . Anthony and Don Jesus stood on the quarter-deck with the scared individual who proved to be the mate . They looked about them laughing a little . It had been ridiculously easy . The growing dawn made the harbour metallic and the Ariostatica rosy . She was theirs  --  and without even a shout . " Where 's the captain ? " asked Anthony of the now sullen mate . " In the cabin . " " Have the kindness to introduce me , senor , " said Anthony . " By the way , what is your own name ? " He thrust the man before him down the ladder without ceremony . " What 's that to you ? " snarled the mate shaking him off roughly . " Nothing much to me , " said Anthony , " but this to you . " He gave him a resounding kick in the tail . They were standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there dimly . As the man rubbed his posterior and whimpered , Anthony could hear the rats scuttling in the hold . The fellow was evidently a futile coward . His face was as yellow and undecided as an omelette . Anthony remembered how McNab had dealt with such cattle . " I have not yet the honor of knowing your name , senor , " he said , softly moving toward him again . " Maria Magdalena Soller , " the fellow piped promptly enough now , clapping his hands over his derriere again . " Listen , Mary Magdalen , " said Anthony . " From now on I am in command of this ship . Do what I say instantly , and life will be easy for you ; fail , and I will kick you loose from your stern . Do you , as it were , understand ? " He smiled quietly . " Si , senor , " whispered the man apathetically . There was nothing in him which even thought of resisting what lay behind the frosty look in his antagonist 's blue-grey eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commander he now noticed almost filled the passage-P512 way . On the deck he had looked slim and youthful , but not here . Por Dios , what a mule 's foot ! Under his trousers the mate felt sure he already resembled a pansy bed . " El capitan esta la , " he muttered . " Captain who ? " " Ramon Lull . " " Bueno ! Now go and hang a green light in the starboard shroud , " said Anthony . " Have you one ? " " Si . " " Si , senor ! " prompted Anthony . " And the green light quickly before it gets too , light ! " " Si , senor , " repeated the man submissively , and scrambled up the ladder glancing hastily behind him . Anthony went aft to the end of the passage and thumped on the door . He was amused to see that it was painted a cream-white and had a wreath of roses on its panel ; a silver lock . He looked about him . All the fittings were equally sumptuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was even an inlaid ebony deck . Christ , how elegant !  --  and filthy ! Someonehummed a snatch of opera in a sleepy falsetto in the cabin . Ile banged on the door again with a will . A volley of shrill , Majorcan curses oozed through the panels like foul dew from a dirty rose . Ile gave the door the boot , springing the lady-like , silver lock clear out of kelter , and entered . A small man in a silk skull-cap , who evidently owned the falsetto voice , for he was exhausting its abusive possibilities , sat up and arrangedhis nightshirt with the fluttered air of a startled canary . Seeing Anthony was a stranger he stopped and rested two white , smooth hands on the dirty sheet as if they had been paralysed . Behind him on the pillow Anthony could see the face of a quadroon girl with a wave of kinky , dark curls spread behind her like a fan . Save for the dark rosy-tan of her cheeks and the too-heavy lips , it might have been a face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the eyes ruined it . They drooped and were heavy-lidded as though tired with looking at a nightmare from which there was no escape . It was the countenanceof a ruined angel . For an instant it made him so curiously uneasy that he forgot even the errand he had come upon . Then he laid his pistol and his papers on the table . " You are the el captain of the Ariostatica , Don Ramon Lull ? " he asked . The man slipped two thin legs from the covers and thrust his feet into a pair of ridiculously embroidered mules . " Thou sayest it , " he said managing to convey an insult . " Do not thou ' me , thou little man , " said Anthony . " Listen to this , "  |p513I  le quietly read him the authorization for taking over the Ariostatica . The captain took it very calmly , too calmly in fact . At first his only reply was to hum a few staves of a popular air from time to time . Then he asked a few keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . I am still captain but you are in command . And the police are now on deck you say ? " " Six of them and the comandante , " said Anthony . " What does Your Magnificence command then ? You see this is the first time I have ever been , ahem , temporarily sequestrated . I am still a little confused . I am sure Senor Gallego will be as charmed as I am . You will be royally received in Africa , senor , as the representative of the crown . " He shifted the skull-cap back on his head and grinned at Anthony in a way the latter did not like . Evidently Don Ramon would play a waiting game . Anthony determined to strike hard now . " In the first place , my hospitable friend , " said he , " I shall require your cabin for my own use . You will move out of it immediately . Also , even more immediately , you will go on deck and get your ship under way . " " Impossible , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Anthony taking up the letter he had been reading and revealing his pistol under it . " Or  --  shall I call the comandante ? " The captain 's face fell . He looked about him as if for some way out , shrugged his shoulders , and began to put on his clothes . With his shirt pulled half-way over his head he burst into another volley of shrill curses . An invisible little man swearing helplessly in falsetto through a starched frill made Anthony rock . " Ah , for the love of Mary do not laugh at me , senor , " said Don Ramon reappearing at last with tears of rage in his eyes . " It is bad enough to lose one 's ship and one 's cabin without being laughed at too ! " He whined on a little . " But you will permit me to keep my own cabin boy in the second room . I hope you will , senor , " he added plaintively while drawing on his shoes slowly . The girl on the bed stirred uneasily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is my property . I can not spare him . " " I have my own servant , " said Anthony . " It is a bargain then ? " cried the man . " Certainly , " laughed Anthony , glad of peace at so cheap a concession . The captain began to move about more cheerfully now as if he were well enough satisfied and had made his own terms . He even showed some alacrity and became voluble . " In a minute , senor , in a minute . Three of the crew are still ashore . But we shall not delay . No , I assure you . I shall be on deck in aP514 minute . " He began to put on a pair of preposterous , green , satin breeches . " In five minutes we shall be under way . " He put powder in his shoes . " Polio , rouse yourself ! My essence , the new scent bottle , where is it ? " The brown body of " Polio " now emerged from the berth somewhat sullenly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elitist and after some bending over and rummaging gave the captain a small perfume bottle with a silver top . Anthony sat in astonished silence If it had not been for the evidence of nature before his eyes he would still have thought that Polio was a girl . Suddenly an overpowering odor of tuberoses filled the cabin . The captain had removed the stopper from the bottle and was anointing his hair . Anthony got up choking and drove the little man on deck with a hearty curse . Don Jesus spat over the side and grinned at the apparition from a band box which now began to walk up and down the quarter-deck giving shrill orders and humming operatic airs . The order was repeatedeach time by a huge negro in a green turban . With much confusion the anchor was finally weighed . Polio came on deck . Dank Jesus spat again . Anthony stood by the wheel taking it all in . He thought he had never seen such a sorry crew . There were some truly villainous faces among them . The best were a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envy you , Don Antonio , " said the comandante . Anthony agreed . But he was soon busy enough keeping one eye on the deck and getting his own boxes on board . Cibo 's boat had arrived . How glad he was Juan was to be with him ! The sails went up by jerks one by one . There was no wind yet but the tide was taking the ship out . In a few minutes they would he passing the Wampanoag lower down . He climbed into the shrouds and waited till they were abreast of her . " Collins , " he roared . A familiar figure lounging by the Wainpanoag 's galley suddenly snapped to and looked about him with amazement . " Here , Collins ! On the schooner ! " he cried . Collins ran to the rail " Where be ye bound ? " he shouted excitedly . " Africa ! " " God help ye ! " Captain Elisha came up in his night-shirt . Anthony saw them tall : ing and getting smaller as the water between the ships widened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aboard here . " Anthony waved helplessly . " The Missus sends her regards . She says Lord love ye . " He triedp515to call something back to them but failed . The captain waved his old night-cap . " And so say I , " he roared . It was too far to reply now . He could see them still watching the schooner , and he knew what they were saying about her sloppy sails . Oh , if Collins were only aboard the Ariostatica . How it would go then ! He leaned over the taffrail and looked astern . Cibo 's boat had cast loose and was making back for Regla . Breakfast on the veranda  --  how pleasant that was ! He wondered if Dolores were awake yet , and stood gazing back at the hills about Los Molinos . The swift ebb at the harbour entrance took the ship and drew her out to sea . The wind outside filled her sails as she turned eastward , rising and falling slowly to the ground swell . The two boats that had drifted against her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shackled rowers in the police barge were already sprawled out on the thwarts , belly down . Brother Francois was still sitting alone . in the stern where he had been left an hour before . He was motionless . Anthony wondered if he was praying . He himself , he remembered , could no longer do so . He was alone now . There was absolutely nothing beyond for him to lean on . Cibo had put the last touch on that . Nothing was left but the world and Anthony . He had his own will and his wits to cope with coming events , and a bargain to keep . He looked back again toward Havana before turning to the deck and its business . Following the ship a few lengths behind Brother Francois 's barge he saw the black fin of the giant shark which had attached itself to the Ariostatica.  |p519A  GRADUAL APPROACH T O A F R I C ANINE weeks  --  and they were only a little south of the Cape Verdes . Much had happened in that time , although outwardly 1 ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a fast little topsailschooner with plenty of space below decks . It was only her dainty lines that made men apply a diminutive to her instinctively . But she had met light , baffling airs from the coast of Puerto Rico onward and had lazed across the broad belt of the world . Only constant showers had kept her crew from running short of water . Some of them were already showing the early symptoms of scurvy . A thousand miles from land Brother Francois had come down with the yellow fever . That and the persistent presence of the shark which had dogged them day and night were for some weeks the chief topicsconversation for the crew . Even the tense conflict which all on hoard felt to be going on between Anthony and the captain paled into insignificance before the persistence of the indomitable hammerhead who had been dubbed " Old Faithful . " Every morning found his black fin in precisely the same relative position as the evening before . At night it moved a little closer . One attempt to hook the monster had all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big fish alone . He seemed to know what he wanted when he followed a slaver . " When he gets his belly full he 'll go , " said one of the old hands , and not until then . But it 's white meat he wants eastward ho . He knows . He 's an old ' un . " Considerable humorous , but nevertheless nervous and superstitious speculation as to who might provide the tidbit was rife . Several youngsters who were persistently nominated as scapegoats were ready to fight . The sickening of Brother Francois was to them at least merely a providential designation of Jonah . But to Anthony and Juan , for the young sailor stood by manfully , it meant long hours of perilous nursing and the contemplation of the monk 's patient agony . Brother Francois had doubtless picked up the infection before leavingHavana , where he had secretly nursed many among those who were always being laid low by what amounted in that port to a perpetualepidemic . So when the headache and lassitude and the muscular pains began the priest was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedy available was common table salt in water and aP520 purgative . He drank large quantities of the former , disregarding what effect it might have upon hastening the scurvy . Nevertheless , in a few days his condition was pitiable . The news of the nature of the priest 's illness , which could not be concealed , had a peculiar solvent effect upon the miniature world of the Ariostatica . Authority backed by a strong hand was the only thing that might have held it together . But in the noble captain , Don Ramon Lull , authority did not reside . He had neither the will not the courage necessary to enforce it . On the same afternoon that Brother Francois took to his cabin with Yellow Jack as a bedmate , the realm Ariostatica divided into three distinct spheres of influence . Don Ramon , El Polio , and the estimable Maria Magdalena Soller betook themselves to the quarter-deck where two hammocks swung under a piece of old sail sufficed temporarily for all three . Luckily for them the weather was calm and balmy . Only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did not look his way often . The captain 's domestic arrangements might even be described as " nice . " He and El Polio had the double hammock . A small sea chest of the captain 's provided with drawers was arranged near by with a silver . mounted toilet set on the top . This contrived to , confer on the little , quarter-deck of the schooner a certain boudoir atmosphere unusual onj the Atlantic to say the least . It wanted but one fresh breeze to ruinso fragile and dapper an aspect , but that brisk breeze was long lacking , ) Such was the first kingdom on the ship where in reality only a titular captain reigned . The second kingdom was the fo'c'sle , the third was the cabin . The fo'c'sle quarantined both the cabin and the quarter-deck . The quarterdeckhad already quarantined the cabin . Mortal fear of contagion . fear made physically visible by the genial presence of " Old Faithful " just astern , was the effective warden of the marches . Anthony and Juan were left alone , strictly alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had now the entire suite of cabins to themselves and the hold beneath it , although that perhaps , together with the rest of the ship 's lower regions , might have been described as the neutral empire of the rats . In the fo'c'sle seventeen temporarily affable , man-stealing ruffians held forth and carried on in such manner as it pleased them best to do . Their reign of riot was aggravated rather than tempered by the overshadowinginfluence of one Polypheme , a Gold Coast Frenchman , possessed of one eye and one knife with either of which he could fix his victims suddenly even at a distance . This man was constantly begettingthe twins Trouble and Confusion by a process of parthenogenesis . So it was that in a few hours after it became news the illness of Brother Francois had produced on the Ariostatica a condition of staticp 521mutiny . As usual there was not lacking a logical reason . It was believedby all the Christians on the ship that the air , particularly the night air , communicated the contagion . Hence the more air they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far logic and Christianity . With the Mohammedans in the vessel it was different . They , as good followers of the Prophet , believed that death would overtake them when Allah willed . For that reason they did not care into what portion of the ship they went , whether it was inhabited by the sick or well . All places were alike to them equally exposed to the unreasonable arrows of fate . Hence , as universal prisoners they remainedfree . The practical conduct of the ship soon fell almost entirely into their hands by pure force of circumstance . Captained I ) y the giant Arab negro , Ali Bongo , they went where common sense and the occasional frantic voice of Don Ramon demanded . That the captain still delivered orders from the quarter-deck , some of which were still obeyed , either through necessity or caprice was the chief reminder of the formal order of nautical life . Senor Soller , the mate , made daily observations and marked his charts there . There the four Mohammedans also did their tricks at the wheel in regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised them . For this essential service they were despised by the free spirits of the fo'c'sle and carefully shunned as possible carriers of contagion . For in quarantining itself from the quarter-deck , the fo'c'sle had by no means been oblivious to certain privileges and exemptions which I'olypheme had pointed out would ensue . These were now enjoyed to the uttermost . Any semblance of regular watches was given up . yards , quarrelling , and boozy slumber were now the order of both day and night . The only systematic labour actually indulged in was the plundering of the ship 's stores in the main hold . When the languid tweeze shifted , a few of the crew sometimes condescended to trim the forward sails , but nothing more . The only exceptions to this delightfulstate of relaxation were the cook and his boy , who were reconsecratedto continue their usual labour by general acclamation and the violent laying on of hands . Thus the drifting Ariostatica grew more and more a slattern day I ) y day . Her standing rigging soon hung slack . Rubbish accumulated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met by jeers . Food in wooden kids was shoved at the officers through the quarter-deck railing , and the cook retired . The same mess-kids were afterwards towed overboard in a bucket . Unfortunatelythe weather continued to favour this lax state of existence . Half the time it was dead calm or there were only fainthearted , little breezes interspersed with warm rains . About a hundred yards behindP522the ship " Old Faithful " battened on the unusually succulent garbage which now came his way . A small folding chair which Don Ramon hurled overboard in a rage went the same way and did not even pro  --  duce a flurry . Meanwhile , Brother Francois was tended by Anthony and Juan i the cabin . In the general state of affairs which had so unexpected ) developed Anthony felt himself temporarily helpless . The captain indeed , did not fail to blame him for having weakened his authority He frequently sat safely at the top of the hatch and expressed himself on the subject of divided authority with a laxative fluency . That the was some truth in Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also evident to him that the captain was glad o the excuse and loaded upon its back all the blame for the trouble which the man 's own weaknesses had brought about . And then there was another curious thing about Don Ramon ; having once relieved hi mind , he would return happily to the quarter-deck . There , despite hi ridiculous position , he managed , as Anthony could tell from the noise that went on just over his head , to have a genuine good time . For through the deck planks percolated into the cabin , where Brother Francois lay , the mild strumming of a guitar at night , the soft pa of the feet of El Polio in some heathenish dance , and the falsetto of Don Ramon raised in song . Such lyric outbursts were often greet from the fo'c'sle with an applause in which sarcasm and genuine appro. ciation were inextricably mixed . In the sound of that mixture of vivas , howls , and catcalls , Anthony recognized what was the real strength of his rival . He understood from that bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was yet a certain sense of brotherhood between him and the fo'c'sle , a bad admiration for his open and unabashed enjoyment of an unmoral existence . Don Racoon 's , indeed , was a simplicity of evil which those who still suffered from dregs of conscience might well envy and admire . Between men who were ambitious to be abandoned and to prosper by it , it was a bond . In any crisis Anthony felt that the captain and t ho fo'c'sle would be found united against him . And he began to under  --  stand , too , that Don Ramon was cunning . Perhaps his indulgence of the crew while the Ariostatica drifted to Africa through the doldrums was , under the circumstances , somewhat calculated . Don Ramon expected to reap his own advantage from it when the time came . It was a little plainer now why the owners had confided a ship to a man like Don Ramon . Perhaps they knew their own trade well enough to understand that the ideal captain of a slaver was one who had no squeamishness at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage in confusion while Anthony could only prevail by bringing about an order in which legal authority would bep523recognized . That was the problem . Whether the crisis would arise ( luring the voyage or upon their arrival at Gallego 's slave barracoon at Bangalang , he could not tell . He must use his wits . That was all he had to depend upon . He had already taken precautions against purely sneaking violence . He and Juan went well armed and Don Ramon and Soller knew it . That was that . Neither of them , he felt , would risk his own precious skin . Meanwhile , the captain and Soller played cards on the quarter-deck , hoping that " yellow jack " would solve their difficulties by removing all the unwelcome intruders in the cabin . That was another reason why the " quarantine " was so rigidlyenforced . " How do you like your temporary sequestration now ? " grinned Senor Maria Magdalena Soller clown the hatchway . " It might be a permanent one , you know . " He shrugged his shoulders . Ali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin . It certainly seemed likely that Brother Francois at least would leave the ship . There were small means at hand for detaining him . As the fever ran its inevitable gamut , Anthony sat by the priest 's bunk doing the best he could . Compared with this trial his experience on theWampanoag had been nothing . " Certainly , " he thought , " I have no reason to be in love with ships . 1 have strange luck there . It goes better with me on land . " And for a time it went badly enough . He and Juan settled themselves as best they could to live through the state of siege . After that ? . . . " But sufficient unto the day . . . " Anthony told himself . Certainly it was all weird enough . Temporarily shoving his own problem aside , which it was plain might wait while the good weather lasted , he and Juan devoted themselves day and night to Brother Francois . They carried him out of the dark , little hole at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Ramon , into the big stern cabin from which the captain and his ami had been excluded . A large window of leaded bull's-eyes set in a kind of battenedcasement ran clear across the stern . After two o'clock the place was flooded with sunlight . There was still a vile , faded carpet with an obscure coat of arms on the floor . There was also a large stain in one corner , deeper than all the others , about which ugly stories were still told . The Ariostatica was a woman with a past . She had been built at Marseilles for a rich and recently ennobled banker some years before the Revolution . She had been called La Venus du Midi then . It wassaid that on a cruise to Naples her first owner had murdered his mistress  --  inproof of which there was the stain . The story had followed the ship persistently . She had soon ceased to be an instrument ofp524 luxury , and after several evil vicissitudes had fallen to the Span slave trade cheaply enough . Hence there was something undoubtedly sinister about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fittings which not been wrenched loose or battered away still glimmered throw ; film of filth . Anthony and Juan did their best to remedy this by such cleans as they could contrive . But even in his misery when Brother Fran . was first carried into the place he sensed its atmosphere . The Gallic humour of a ci-devant man of the world glimmered his eyes as he lay looking at the bourgeois cupids romping in sooty roses on the smudgy , blue ceiling . It amused him to think he being brought to die in an apartment faintly reminiscent o f I Ramon 's tuberose perfume , a cabin whose upholsterer must have about him a touch of debased genius , for he had managed to rel in a series of damask panels the innocent story of Paul and Virgin a highly interesting way . The story had even been given a ha ending . Just over the ship 's bed that Brother Francois now occupied , P and Virginia were to be seen in that full consummation of their 1 . which the too-pure and tragic pencil of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is universal , the smudges and prints the dirty hands of the slaves who had been packed into the cabin the Ariostatica 's last voyage from Africa testified in a truly tou ing way . The hand of one huge negro seemed to have striven to tear body of Virginia from the panel . And through a hundred other wistful blotches wandered the traces of a pair of wistful and delicate fin tips which Anthony thought he recognized as those of the youth El Polio , the chicken . Anthony imagined he could see that arch yo locked in the cabin during his master 's absence trying to seize from the panel what Don Ramon had denied him . All this amused Brother Francois , for even in his approaching ag he still continued to be French . When he was carried into the cap he managed to smile gallantly and to remark to Anthony that a ha ' ending to every story was what the multitude always desired . " See , " said he , pointing to the panel above him . " They have tried to tear love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real enough to handle with their poor dirty hands . Yet it remains apart . Cone you see , is what this unhappy age demands . Once I wrote about such things as that . It was long before the Revolution , before I had c tered into real life . Paul and Virginia then was still thought to charming . " He sighed and settled back with an air of finality in the blowzy pillows . P 525 " Well , I shall try to live up to my own criticism by making a proper end of it here . If not , pardon me for the trouble I am about to give you , mes amis . " Even then the fever was already upon him . He was talking in the accents of some former self . It seemed to be a soldier rather than a monk who lay there . But that was only momentary . He looked out of the stern windows along the wake of the drifting ship and at the tilting blue line of the horizon beyond . Through the bubbles a little behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an obscene emanation from the bottomless deep . To the priest 's now disordered imagination it seemed that the shark 's mouth was so framed as to be able to utter only the word " Golgotha . " He closed leis eyes . Then he opened them at sunset , seeming to be able to gaze with a wide-pupilled , feverish glance out of his shadowed sockets into the red orb itself . The last thing he saw in the brief twilight was the shark which had moved a little nearer . He shivered . " Men would be like that , my son , if God had not given them mercy . " They were the last words he addressed consciously to Anthony before the fever clutched his mind awry . He then seemed to be using his remaining conscious minutes to pray . " If possible let this cup be taken from me . . . Nevertheless . . . " he muttered . He motioned to close the window and shut out the vision astern . They lit a dim lamp . " Let the Comforter be with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered together in Thy name . . . Thou rememberest . . . " After that he held converse only with unseen things . Yet such was the vital and moving spirit of this man that even in the days of delirium which ensued his personality expanded and dominated by a kind of vibrant quality , not only Anthony and Juan , but the dowdy appurtenances of the cabin itself . Anthony found it impossible to explain this impression to himself by this and that or here and there . It was too subtle to isolate , but it was not too intangible to feel . The quality of the man 's being , now strangely released , as if by the heat of the fever , evoked in those near him a continuous state of high emotion . In this condition they were able to glimpse and even to share to some extent in the exaltation in which it was now revealed to them Brother Francois must habitually dwell . Anthony , indeed , wondered now at the calm exterior of the man even when his health had endured . For that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to move with the speed and force of the flame that jags from sky to earth . Yet there was nothing momentary about it . Like the vision of that flame seared upon the eyeballs it remained . It was not ephemeral . It was the natural state and condition of the man uncov-P526 ered . Anthony could apprehend now why it was that the strong body of Brother Francois , despite its calm exterior , had seemed to be worn and emaciated from within . Recollecting him now as he had been at Regla , he found that his mental impression of him was that of some thing which emanated light . Perhaps he had been wrong in attributingall that quality to the vine alone . How wonderful must be the strength of that gentleness which kept such vivid potentialities in control ! Whence came the ability to poise and balance them ? No wonder the world was afraid of such men ! No wonder everyone from the captain-general to the philosophic Cibo had been disturbed ! Had they felt a vesicle of lightning near ? Sup pose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what then ? Anthony sat looking at him  --  where he lay apparently dying in I he , murdered harlot 's bunk  --  lost in wonder , oblivious to all else . For the drama of this spirit even in dissolution made all else seem trivial ; ordinary life flaccid . Even though the light of this man was now dimmed by the dark heat of his dreadful fever , though the lightningmotions of his thought were disordered by illness ; while he lay thus revealed by the weakness of the body , stripped spiritually naked . no one near him could pay attention to anything else . " I am thy lamp , " he muttered once , " behold the flame consume ' the oil of me . Let it be acceptable . " After that he no longer seemed to realize his own predicament . Through days of sustained delirium he tended only gradually toward a state of exhausted unconsciousness . Not until the third night war the crisis passed . Then the collapse came suddenly . During this infernally and celestially illuminated period there we few niches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not forced to explore . From the total-recall which streame dincoherently from the monk 's parching lips Anthony was eventually able to reconstruct for himself the order of time and place which the delirium ignored . To the parentless listener even the man 's childish babble and talk with his mother was breathless with a mysterioutly sweetness . At some chateau in Picardy the two walked through an orchard an spoke of the birds . In a field placed only in space he plucked flower again with a shy little girl . " Laugh again , Adele , laugh again , " cried Brother Francois rising up to listen . " Here are daisies for your apron . I have never forgotten you . I knew you were not really dead . Here are the flowers . See , they are fresh still , "  --  and he plucked the foul bedclothes . Then there was his gay but stern father , who ridicule was smooth as polished adamant . " But it is here among our own people that I belong , mon pere . " In those days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him he was not mad . It had 527been revealed to him that he was more fully sane than those about him . This it seemed was the cross he found hardest to bear . He was always pleading with the " blind , " always . Versailles had been horrible . They were all blind there . On the second night in the midst of much vacant converse Brother Francois became almost lucid again . In a flood of semi-coherent eloquencehe was once more accompanying the tumbrils on their way to the guillotine . Not a few of the blind eyes of which he had complainedwere then opened for a last look at life . The exhausting tension , the fierce ebullitions of frantic souls , the last tender confidences  --  words spoken to those who clung to him desperately for even a glint of hope  --  these were all fiercely renewed as the days of the Terror became incandescent again in the monk 's fevered brain . Anthony semed to feel the lean shadows of the buildings in the Paris streets falling across him as he rode in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chill lamplight of the cabin , silent except for the metallic cadences of the dying man 's voice and the faint wash of the waves below , these scenes took on for Anthony far more than the vague outlines of a conversation . He participated in them fully and yet mysticallyas if at a distance . The endless monodrama went on interminably with all of the amazing detail of the mind which never forgets released again into life . Clenched hands , weapons , impassioned faces tossed up in the words of the priest . Out of the sea of the streets came things which had long forgotten themselves . With Brother Francois Anthony overlookedthe plains , the heights , and the abysses revealed by impassioned men and women about to vanish . He faced with them the thunder of drums , the prayers , pleadings , weeping ; the laughter , the snarls , and the screams of the final act . " Ascend to heaven ; son of St. Louis "  --  drums , and a tempest of jibes . One needed to have had faith , a true exaltation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desperate human necessity for hope beyond ; the impossibility of rejecting it entirely when the whole being is really faced with the final riddle was flung into Anthony 's face . From such scenes the soul of Brother Francois seemed to turn with paternal fondness  --  as if on a visit to a beloved daughter and her children  --  tothe people and the sylvan neighbourhood of his first beloved parish . For a while his spirit had found itself at home there as a pastor of peasants . His assumed patois itself was touching . His homely dialogues were compounded of a wise pathos , laughter , and tears . In all this , and in physical and mental intimacies beyond trace , intimacies which resided in the tones of his voice and the lines of his face  --  in all of them now poured out for hours on end like the seem-P530 and dry and yellow , the eyes closed . They themselves , revolted and exhausted to the verge of staggering weariness , sat down in chairs and slept . When they wakened in the damp heat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Water , my friends , " he whispered . " I am still with you again for a while ! " Anthony looked at him and wept . What now contained Brother Francois seemed like a parchment lantern in which only a feeble candle burned . Yet as days went on the light there grew stronger . It had not been easy for Anthony and Juan to subsist themselves during this time . Without the negro Ali Bongo , and the chests which Cibo had contributed , they must have perished . From , Ali Bongo , who was now the only person on the ship who would even hand them objects through the cabin hatch , they received water and occasional warm slops prepared by the cook . From the chests of Cibo came certaindainties , wines , and a few preserved delicacies that had probably saved the monk 's life . Cibo had not been a fancy grocer in vain . Anthony now looked through these chests , which had been deposited in the hold beneath the cabin , and was amazed at the variety of useful articles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the monk 's convalescence progressed , Anthonybegan to meet Ali Bongo who enjoyed pickles so much he would even risk his life for them . Here in the close atmosphere raw with bilge , over a candle , in the darkness of the ship 's midriff where the beams and timbers obtruded internally in ribbed shadows , he and the black Mohammedan discussed the predicament of the Ariostatica and arrived after a week 's time at a certain understanding . Ali Bongo was a primal but sensible character . In the plan which Anthony proposed he saw certain advantages to himself and his fellow Foulah tribesmen which would not accrue to them by their merely remaining loyal to the ostensible captain of the ship . A present of one of Cibo 's silver mounted pistols sealed the bargain and carried a fierce delight to the savage self-importance of Ali Bongo 's practical soul . Here was a senor who knew better than to treat one who had been to Mecca like a slave . " By Allah , he would soon be a chieftain again ! " He concealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling to the deck . The only eye which noted the bulge at his waist , and drew its own conclusions , was the single one of Polypheme . That worthy concluded that objects of value were to be obtained by visiting the cabin hold . The quarter-deck was somewhat nonplussed not to say disgruntledp531at the new aspect of affairs . Not only was it evident that neither Anthony nor Juan was going to be obliging enough to die ; Brother Francois was actually getting well . He and his two companions now came on deck together . Their first appearance there gave rise to a violent altercation with the captain and the mate . The crew looked on afar-off with considerable interest , and did not fail to note that over the captain 's bluster Anthony quietly carried his point . An appeal by Don Ramon to Ali Bongo , who was then at the wheel , found that tall heathen neutral . Brother Francois was carried up every day thereafterto sit in a cushioned chair near the stern . Anthony and Juan moved about as they liked , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept up their sanitary bluster . Whether this bluster was sincere or fictitious now Anthony could not for a time be certain . Certainly both captain and mate were afraid of the yellow fever . But it was not long before it becamepretty plain to everybody that Brother Francois 's illness was being used as a thin excuse for a policy of isolation which had in view another end than that of health . What the fo'c'sle wanted , of course , was license . Why the captain also persisted in treating the cabin as if it were still a pesthouse was revealed strangely enough by the stars . Anthony was now able to come on deck and renew his own observations . It was instantly clear to him that the position of the ship as marked on the navigating chart by S611er did not correspond with fact . According to Soper the Arfostatica was about one hundred leagues off the coast of Sierra Leone opposite Freetown . Anthony found her , after taking a lunar to check his longitude , at about 20 ; North and 30 West . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cape Verde Islands . No doubt at Praia it was Don Ramon 's plan to make port , hoist a signal of distress , and land those whom he would certify as convalescentto the authorities . There would certainly be a Lazar house at Praia . Who the " convalescents " would be , Anthony had small doubt . The schooner might have to lie in the roads for some days to accomplish this . But it would be too neat a way for Don Ramon to rid himself legally of his unwelcome passengers to be neglected . The Portuguese would pay small attention to Anthony 's Spanish letters . It would be a fine thing to have all his high hopes end in quarantinein some filthy jail or dismal convent . The situation must be net instantly . First making sure of Ali Bongo and his followers , who saw an end to their own expectations should the ship leave Anthony at the Cape Verdes , he approached the captain next morning on the quarterdeckas near as that nervous gentleman would permit . Don Ramon and Soller were as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop and listen while he pointed out to them the lament aide discrepancy between the ship 's true position and the chart . Anthony had now some time to study the captain . He had conic to the conclusion that under almost any circumstance Don Ramon would do the easiest thing . It was a natural conclusion drawn from his cowardice and indolence . If one ruse was uncovered he would simply go on to another . " Anything to avoid bringing things to an issue , " would be the captain 's motto . In this case he therefore sup plied him with an easy way out of the predicament . He simply assumed that the calculations of Soller had been in error . Nor did he neglect to salve that individual by mentioning that even an expert navigator and calculator frequently went astray through some fault in the instruments . That so accurate a mathematical mind as Senor Soller 's , an expert card player too , could have made an error of more than seven degrees in latitude was unthinkable . It was the instrument that was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make use only of his own ? At any rate , he himself intended to do so ! The captain and the mate turned a bit green at thus hearing their little plan dusted out . The mate was even inclined to argue . Armed with his data , however , Anthony was firm . He pointed out the imminent danger of shipwreck on the island reefs if the present course were continued . He assumed that it would not be , and laid out the correct one . " The captain , " he said after a little pause , " will be pleased to give the proper directions to the man at the wheel . " An interval of tense silence ensued . Don Ramon 's hand remained trembling slightly upon a card which he had been about to play after a quarter of an hour 's consideration . Anthony continued to look at him and smile . " Don Ramon will recollect that by the letters issued under the seal of the captain-general I am empowered to direct the course of this ship . Through the captain if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to take matters into my own hands . " He leaned forward touching the pistol in his belt . The captain looked up and saw Ali Bongo grinning ; Juan sauntering by . Don Ramon scattered the cards from the board with an oath and gave the orders to Ali Bongo at the wheel . Sweeping almost a quarter circle down the horizon , the bow of the Ariostatica turned south . For the rest of the morning the skipper and his mate muttered to gether pretending to be trying to reconstruct their game . Perhaps they were . What conclusions they arrived at Anthony did not know , nor did he much care . In the first crucial test he had come off triumphant . This was the ninth week out . The Rio Pongo , if the breezeP533held , could be only a few days away . In those few days he must get the ship into his own hands . It was the breeze , and Polypheme the single-eyed , that came unexpectedly to his aid . A few hours after the interview with the captain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin hold . Wine and fine biscuit being enjoyed by the fo'c'sle had aroused the suspicions of Ali Bongo . Hasty investigation showed that about half the wine and spirit from Cibo 's precious little store in the hold had already gone . Anthony and Juan took turns at sentry-go there . The bulkheads in the schooner were only temporary and somewhat flimsy . On return voyages the entire space was given up to packing in the bodies of slaves . All barriers were then removed . The place was hot and stank of bilge , negroes , sulphur and vinegar , the last two having been used to cleanse it after a manner in Havana . Sitting there for three hours at a time was no joke . How the slaves endured it for weeks on end Anthony could not imagine . But he had his reward . During his second trick as sentry he heard the sound of bare feet approaching the bulkhead on the far side . There were a few stealthy shufflings and a loose plank in the bulkhead was removed . A man 's body came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel , lit a candle  --  and found himself looking down the pistol of Senor Adverse . It was impossible not to admire Polypheme a little then . The expression on his face did not even change . Anthony made him crawl ahead of him through the hatch into the cabin . That was a mistake , as he soon found . He should have called for Juan . He kept the man covered . But as he himself emerged from the drop which led into the little passage above , the fellow dodged like a lizard , and threw a knife . It had been aimed for the heart and it pinned the inner edge of Anthony 's left sleeve to the combing . Seeing he had failed , and that the pistol still looked at him , the prisoner fell on his knees and began to plead . From the expression on his captor 's face he was afraid his time had come . And in this he was not far wrong . If he had made one move to escape , the finger on the trigger would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anthony locked him in an empty cabin and stood by a few minutes longer while Juan fitted him with irons from the ample supply provided for slaves . No one said anything . It had all been enormously easy , Anthony thought . Those on the quarter-deck had not even been disturbed in their siesta . Warning Polypheme that any noise on his part would bring Ali Bongo with a whip , Anthony pocketed the key and went on deck . He was delighted with himself for several reasons . The capture of Polypheme in so ignominious a manner was an enormous strokep534 of luck . More important , however , was a discovery about himself . In situations of great danger he did not grow weak and tremble ; he became strong from anger . Even better than that , he did not get confused . The nerves he had inherited were good ones . What an inestimable gift ! He had actually been so much in command of himselfeven when the knife came as not to shoot . How curious it was that things like this should be happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him ! He looked at Brother Francois sitting back weakly in his chair near the stern . I le was lost in another world , poor man ! But Anthony  --  Anthony vas a part now of events . He felt he could not even afford to talk ton much with Brother Francois . No , Anthony was doing things ! Let them be done then . He felt suddenly sure of himself . He could bend those about him to his own ends . Don Ramon dozing , curled up in the shadow of a boat , filled him with contempt . Certainly he could outwit that man ! He turned suddenly hearing Ali Bongo calling to him from the wheel . The man was pointing astern . Some miles away a white squall was tearing down upon them , lines of white caps racing before it . Anthony began to shout warnings and orders to take in sail . Juan hustled Brother Francois below . Ali Bongo and his men stripped the mainmast while Anthony stood by at the wheel . He meant to bring the ship to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead of lowering away there , an argument ensued and the foresail was reefed and set again . Ali Bongo danced with rage . A few confused people were fumbling on the topsail downhauls when Don Ramon sat up and confounded everything twice over by countermanding the ordersalready given . Missing Polypheme , the men forward were at hopeless odds among themselves . While she was in this state of provocativedeshabille the squall romped down uproariously upon the Ariostatica . Luckily Anthony did not try to throw her up into the wind now . He let her drive . Even under the reefed foresail the schooner keeled over so far as to ship combers down the hatches . The jibs and loose square-topsail beat about for a few seconds like the wings of a frantic roc and then literally leapt clear of the bolts to disappear ahead in a smother of foam . The rigging shrieked . Anthony saw the eyeballs of the entire ship 's company bent upon him at the wheel . " Let go the foresheet , " he roared . It was fouled ! Ali Bongo crawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept around like a whip lash against the lee shrouds , knocking four of the gaping men cold . Ali Bongo rolled into the scuppers . For a minute the Ariostatica shivered . Then she slowly rose righting herself and slipping off the tons of green water that had nearly foundered her . Amidships there was ap535lake where the cook and a large pot floated about with ashes and firewood . Then the bulwarks gave way there releasing the load . The ship bolted ahead like a whipped horse . By some miracle the reefed foresail held . More surprising yet El Polio ran forward and lashed the boom to the shrouds . Holding with all his might against the spokes Anthony was just able to keep the schooner from broaching to . With the aft sails and the jib gone , the drag of the foresail against the helm was terrific . Presently two of the Foulah tribesmen came and relieved him at the wheel which gave him a brief opportunity to look about . He turned to find Don Ramon standing behind him with his legs spread apart and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the whole crisis the captain had been coolly giving him orders . Thus it was that with most of the men on the fo'c'sle Don Ramon secured the credit for having saved the ship . For an instant Anthony was overcome by rage . He felt himself losing control of his feet and hands . A mad impulse to kick the preposterouslittle hypocrite clear off the deck and down the hatchway all but mastered him . Then he determined to make use of the captain'scunning for his own ends . Seeing the man was really at a loss what to do , he descended upon him and taking him unawares , half by threats in an undertone and by loud firm suggestions , forced him to continue in the false part which he had assumed . Before two hours passed Captain Ramon Lull had , as it were , been rushed off his feet into the command of his own ship again . Anthony was greatly aided in this process by the reappearance of Ali Bongo who arose from under a chicken coop in the scuppers as if from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His countenance was rendered sufficiently ferocious by blood and swelling to work miracles by itself . If any had been washed overboard it yet remained to be seen . The crew at any rate thought that Polypheme had gone that way . Without a leader they were temporarily reduced to the condition of somewhat stubborn but confused sheep . Under the inspired , piping falsetto of the captain , who by some miracle they did not understand was now issuing sensible orders , a new jib was broken out and bent on . The ship felt the relief sensibly and no longer threatened to lay to . Axes were produced and some wreckage on the fo'c'sle cleared away . Anthony took the risk of the tools being turned to weapons . From the fo'c'sle the men were worked aft . Even the mate joined in and exerted his authority . " Under a decent captain he might have done well enough , " thought Anthony . A small area of the mainsail was now shown to the wind and the crew assigned to the mainmast were put to work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with its more pressing prob . lems had banished the fear of plague from their minds . The squall blew itself out rapidly . By twilight they were sweeping along under a fine following breeze . The regular watch was called and those who failed to answer were used roughly enough . With a few curses and some grumbling the crew found themselves somehow at their stations , and discipline was enforced through the remainder of the night . At dawn Don Ramon was roused too , to his vast disgust . It was a final test . Juan stood behind him with a pistol , hidden by the mast . The captain was forced to issue orders to clean decks . Some of the crew came forward at this unparallelled insult in an arrogant mood . The turbaned Foulahs descended upon them from the quarter . deck armed with the belaying pins and began to crack heads . It was enough . When the sun rose it beheld the decks of the Ariostatica holy-stoned .. The ropes were neatly coiled and the brass binnacle glittered . Anthony'sideal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was at least approached . If there had only been a little paint ! The yachtishness of the Ariostatica emerged from years of grime . " Sacred blood of a sow , " said a pimply-faced Frenchman spitting on the deck surreptitiously and looking at the stain with comfort , " and this is a slaver ! " Anthony sat in the cabin that morning immensely self-satisfied . In a few hours , through quick thinking and some luck he told himself , he had broken up the captain 's little scheme of isolation and through him had assumed control of the ship . Don Ramon sat across the table too tired with rage to be angry any longer . The desertion of El Poll ' ) to the fo'c'sle had , indeed , reduced him to tears . His favourite was now bunking with the rest of the crew . The shattered state of the highly nervous little captain was scarcely understood by those about him . His falsetto broke and ran a gamut when he spoke . The terrible Senor Adverso had threatened to put him to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He collapsed at the thought . He would do anything to avoid that . But he would also do anything to regain the solace of El Polio . The boy was his slay r in law but Don Ramon was the boy 's slave in fact . So far had hi . passion now carried him that he really cared for little else . The coin mand of the Ariostatica was to him merely the means of regaining Polio . No one else in the cabin could imagine that . No one but the monk . By long acquaintance and sad experience the passions of men were no longer much of a secret to Brother Francois . No excess of either good or evil could surprise him . The situation on the Ariostatica was to him painfully plain . Between the stalwart young man who hadp537evidently suspended his ideals in order " to do things , " what things , of course , he did not know , and Don Ramon who was mad with the excess of a single unnatural affection , the ship , he felt , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It might have surprised certain people to have known that in his heart Brother Francois felt there was little to choose between the baneful effects of obstinate , wrong human desires . Anthony 's in fact he felt might in the end overwhelm more people than Don Ramon 's . But he himself could do nothing . He was too weak . Scarcely able to move even in the chair in which he sat without dangerous exhaustion , he could only sit and think . What lay ahead he did not dare to dwell upon as yet . It would have stopped his heart . He lay and looked up at the bright colours of Spain that flaunted themselves from the peak where they had been hoisted at Havana . The gold and blood of them , he remembered , had always been associated with the banner of the cross . In the inextricable tangle of contradictions which this implied to him , for he believed in Providence , he sat back inert and benumbed . Only his own way was clear . But there was such a terriblelight upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . The body of him must sleep yet . During the day both Anthony and the captain came to him ; Anthonyto try to make the invalid more comfortable , Don Ramon to obtain comfort from the priest . " My son , " said Brother Francois to Anthony after thanking him for some wine . " Has it not occurred to you already that you have made a bad bargain ? " Anthony went away angry . He did not care to think of that . Brother Francois was very sorrowful . Don Ramon after much beating about the bush finally decided to risk his body by approaching the convalescent in order to save his soul . The monk 's reassurances of all danger being past finally brought him to his knees near the priest in the shadow of a boat that hid them both from view . There he confessed himself and begged absolution . Brother Francois would grant it provided he would give up the youth . Don Ramon could not do that . He said so and wept . Brother Francois was again sorrowful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours Anthony knew she would raise the coast . At midnight she ran into an oily calm . That calm endured for fearful days . Neither the water , the wind , nor the ship shifted . Only the lights of heaven had motion and a few birds that flew about the Ariostatica and went away again . Only they and the shark moved . The shark was still there . It ranged alongside from time to time expectantly . It nudged the ship and scraped itself against her barnacles sending a light tremor throughP538 her . The men swore now that it was waiting for someone . Hal t humorously they began again to throw dice and to draw lots . There was little else to do . The heat was intense . The shark was always there , by far the most interesting thing in their lives now . His persistencefascinated them . The lot one day fell for five consecutive times on El Polio . That night he heard some of the men whispering about him . In the darkness he crept out of the fo'c'sle and fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm in which the company of the Ariostattica seemed to have been condemned to the hell of their own society for the rest of eternity remained always a nightmare to Anthony . It was plain to him that what had been gained during the squall and the short time afterward was rapidly slipping out of his hands . By the fourth day of calm , with the glass still low but no change , no one could make believe to be in charge of the ship . The men separated themselves to the fo'c'sle again and no longer even pretended to pay attention to a hail from the quarter-deck . Only a half-pint a day of water could be allowed per man . And even that would soon exhaust the now depletedsupply . A hundred miles over the horizon was land . But the crew did not know this . I f they had been told they might have taken to the boats . Exactly what happened to the minds of those marooned on the idle slaver Anthony could not be sure . The changeless colour of the sea , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of something about to occur which never happened , the utter silence and the shark  --  produced the explosion that came . There were a number of half-castes among the crew , all of whom , white or brown , were deeply tinged with Africa . What superstitious and fearful whisperings went on forward night after night and day after day as the wind failed to come , only those who put their heads together in the fo'c'sle and listened desperately might know . On the eighth day a surly deputation came aft demanding that Brother Francois pray again for a breeze . He did so but nothing hale pened . On the ninth the liquid ration was halved . That something had been resolved upon by the men was now patent to both Anthony and the mate Soller as they served out the water and rum with Ali Bongo and his men standing by armed . On these Mohammedans Anthony now pinned his chief hope . They belonged to a tribe in the interior , the Foulahs , who frequently came to the coast in little groups under some leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives by serving a few years at sea , usually on a slaver . Anthony had , he thought , bound them to him by the present of two chests of scarlet cloth , the promise of much more when they arrived , and the cancelling of a year off their sea service . At the end of six months he had promised to dismiss them into the interior again withp539presents of powder and firearms . That was the understanding , and for the most part they had stood by him . But in the mystery which was now afoot they stood aloof , he felt . The most he could get out of Ali Bongo was that whatever was toward did not concern a good Mohammedan and he would not interfere . The outlook was by no means cheerful . The cabin retired on the tenth night thoroughly prepared , but not for sleep . As the night wore on Anthony relieved Juan who was on watch on deck . He took his place in the shadow of the mast and leaned against it . No one was at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helm which had been lashed a week before , had remained so . Some distance astern a slight phosphorescent glimmer proclaimed the presence of " Old Faithful . " All in the fo'c'sle seemed asleep . For a while he thought he was alone on the quarter-deck . In the moonlight he could hear the idle sails dripping dew . Then he saw the head and shoulders of El Polio . He was lying hack on some of Brother Francois ' borrowed pillows in the stern sheets of the captain 's boat where it rested in its cradle on the quarter-deck . At first he thought the boy was asleep , but now he saw his eyes open . They closed slowly again . The expression on the lad 's dark face held him spellbound . There could be no doubt what was happening . He lay looking up at the stars with a film of ecstasy on his lids . His delicately beautiful features were flat and strangely shrunken like some water-lily that had broken from its stem and decayed a little from its first early bloom while drifting helplessly downstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy opened his mouth as if to bleat . But no sound came forth . The jaw merely relaxed and hung down . When a living expression finally returned it was one of extreme terror . He lay absolutely still for so long that it was evidenthe was afraid to move . There was something Anthony could not understand about this . The boy lay with his hands behind his head . If it had not been for that Anthony would have put an end to the business . But the sight of so luxurious and self-hypnotized a dreamer had amazed and fascinatedhim . No other solution had occurred to him . The face alone had held him spellbound . Watching it , he had become aware of profoundand hitherto unsuspected abysses in himself . He too had almost been hypnotized . When the captain suddenly appeared above the gunwale of the boat Anthony stood as if frozen . Indeed , his back grew cold . Don Ramon looked about him and thinking the deck was clear stepped out of the boat and began to sneak forward . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They stood looking atP540 each other . Both of them knew instantly that the other was thinking of the shark . That was why the captain screamed . Whether those who had planned what immediately followed that shrill cry thought they had been discovered and rushed the quarter-deck immediately , or whether the tone of it had merely shattered the ten-d ; iv tension of the unbearable calm , Anthony could never be sure . They must have been waiting , perhaps even creeping up during the minutes before the captain screamed . Scarcely was the sound past his lips when a half score of the crew were upon him . Anthony had just time to roll down the hatch . They had not seen him standing by the mast in the shadow . He caught himself on the ladder and drew his pistol aiming it at the moonlit square above . Whatever came he meant to hold the cabin . But no heads came into the bright square above . There was a hellish clamour on deck . It was the falsetto voice of the captain . Doubtless they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was begging them not to do something . Well , he would not interfere for that man ! Not after what he had just seen . Certainly the agony was genuine now . Don Ramiro could plead eloquently . Then Anthony went cold all over again . Dun Ramon was screaming to them not to throw the boy overboard . Anthony shouted to Juan desperately and started to climb up the ladder . A scream of terror beyond thought rang out above just as his head and shoulders came out of the hatch . The rest was over in two seconds . Someone dragged the boy out of the boat to which he clung desperately , and clutching him about the waist raised him high in the air . The whole mad group precipitated itself toward the stern like an avalanche . For an instant he saw the still childish limbs thrash in the moonlight as the boy was tossed outward . There was a splash just as Anthony leaped aft . But he was met by a return rush toward the fo'c'sle . Rolling and milling about , his pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clutch somebody he heard the voice from the water . No one could listen to that and not go mad . He started to club someone with his pistol but the man broke awayWhen he rose to his feet again the grey decks of the sinister little yacht were empty . He stood there alone in the moonlight . He was clutching a bunch of black chicken feathers in one hand . That was all . It must be a frightful dream . He would wake up soon . Yes , that was it . Chicken feathers ! He knew it was a dream . Sailors do not wear feathers in their hair . He gave a weird laugh and found his chest and ribs hurt him horribly . " Ju-jut " said a wild falsetto voice in his ear . Don Ramon threw his hands up above his head . " No use , " he cried . " All over . " Ile staggered and was bleeding at the mouth. p 541Anthony went and leaned over the taffrail . Infinite miles of a pool of quicksilver seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing moved . The shark had gone . He cried out into the night . Whether it was a prayer or a curse he did not know . Next morning a faint breeze began to push the Ariostatica along toward Africa again . By noon she had gathered considerable way . They raised the low coast by evening and burned flares for a pilot all night . The red , funereal glare danced for miles over the black water . Finally a similar fire answered them from land . P542T H E CREW G O A S H O R EALL night the Ariostatica gradually drew in toward the land , About dawn she was standing off-and-on just keeping underway . Nothing could be done until they picked up the pilot , Now and again the ship lifted sullenly to black hills of water that surged under and past her , marching in upon the coast . Half an hour after some unusual giant passed Anthony thought he could hear its cataclysmic roar as it staggered against the mysterious continent still hidden in darkness to leeward . The sun rose suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as the eye could reach . While he watched , the straight clouds brooding over it wilted . Then , as the air grew hotter and clearer , a million foggy wisps exhaled into the morning as if the camp fires of night were going out . The sun licked the dampness up lilac a thirsty cat 's tongue . In an hour the atmosphere was blue-white and quivering like the heart of a furnace . This , he saw , was a flat , a sullen and silent land . No merry song streamed upward from that stagnant sea of treetops to eastward such as had risen from the gracious forests of Cuba to greet the sun . The only voice here was that of Ocean . Apparently quite calm , it advanced relentlessly upon the strips of islands stretching away over the long , flat horizon where endless miles of monotonous lagoons dazzled the eyes . As though balked of its prey by these thin barriers the sea continued to wrinkle its angry lips along their bone-white beaches , roaring with elemental appetite at the forest beyond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry crunch and smash of the breakers saluted her with a premonitory snarl , Only at one point was there to be seen any break in the seeminglv endless barrier reef that now lay directly before the ship . It was where the Rio Pongo , slipping silently out of the enormous forest , slid into the sea . Emerging from endless fiats , the river was only a convenient funnel for the tides with scarcely any noticeable current of its own . A sharp dent in the facade of the forest beyond the lagoons and a surfless break in the barrier beaches indicated the river 's where abouts . This , and the blue dome of Cape Palmas which loomed tip faintly to the south were the only distinct landmarks , in the entirep543region . All else was a level sea either of green water or of even greener vegetation . Solier pointed out the river mouth to Anthony . " A good landfall , senor ! " He grinned a little sheepishly . " We ought to make Gallego 's anchorage by noon . Well , you will certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rail and turned his back . Anthony felt sure the mate was laughing . He looked at the river gate ahead without enthusiasm . What awaited him there seemed as inscrutable as the dim arches from which the Rio Pongo emerged . Some time after sunrise a black dot , which the restless ocean had been tilting into sight now and then for about an hour past , resolved itself into the expected pilot 's canoe . It was paddled by two Kru boys stark except for breech-clouts . In the centre under a palm hat of Korean proportions sat the pilot in a ragged , military jacket , smoking a calabash pipe . He knocked out this basin for tobacco as he came up the ship 's side , and much to Anthony 's surprise hailed the quarter-deck in English . So11er seemed positively disgruntled by this . Evidently he had been expecting another man . The trouserless emanation from the deep , dressed exclusively in a cast-off marine 's jacket with four brass buttons over the tail , proved to be from the factory of one Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for many a mile inland as " Mongo Tom . " Solier tried him persistently in both Spanish and Portuguese , but the pilot shook his head . For this he was heartily cursed at some length in both tongues , a warm welcome , which as a free man he resented . " Me sabe go-go Bangalang alri ' , " he finally insisted , turning to Anthony who turned him over to the good offices of Ali Bongo . A bargain was soon struck for taking the ship up to Gallego 's anchorage . The mate grunted uneasily and went below , evidently to discuss this unexpected development with the captain who had not yet ventured to crawl on deck again . The pilot took over the wheel without further ado and continued in active conversation with Ali Bongo in some unknown jargon . It appeared that they had known each other . After a while Anthony managed to join in . Ali Bongo did the honours . Berak-Jaumee , he assured Anthony , was one fine , fighting friend , honest man . Jaumee proved to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once made a voyage on a British whaler , it appeared . For that reason Mongo Tom , the Englishman , had taken him on . Jaumee was now not only the best but the only pilot on the river , Anthony learned . There were only two slave factories on the Rio Pongo , Mongo Tom'sP544 and Gallego 's . Both were near Bangalang , a Kru village . Gallego 's lay a little upstream beyond the native huts ; Mongo Tom 's below . Both slavers had once kept pilots , but " Gallego pie-lot no work no more . " " How come that ? " " Gallego no pay . Gallego no pay numbody . Him dade two moons . Feber ! Gallego bery dade . Him hareem go-go big woods . " Jaumee grinned . Here was news indeed , news which it might be just as well to keep from the crew and the captain . If Gallego was dead , Anthony realized his only hope of getting matters in his own hands was a tight hold on the ship , instantly . Consequently he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be with the captain , he felt , when it came to a f ii ; il showdown . If he could only break that combination ! He sent for Juan , and did some intense talking with him and Ali Bongo . He was delighted to see how at the mere prospect of a clash the lean , black Mohammedan brightened up . It promised well , he thought . Ali Bongo had peculiar eyes with golden pupils like those of an eagle . Expressionlessfor the most part except of a constant fierce animal pride , as he and Anthony stood by the taffrail discussing calmly enough ways and means of taking over the schooner , Ali Bongo 's eyes smouldered in the sun . It flashed upon Anthony for the first time how absorbing the business of killing might be . Nothing else could be compared to it for interest . It was the supreme gamble . In a ten-minute conversation with the big Mohammedan both of them had forgotten themselvesentirely in the tense business at hand . Even lack of language had been no barrier . Where Ali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more eloquent though silent tongue . They parted having reached a complete understanding . The ship was now passing through the narrow cleft in the barrier beach . The tide here ran like a mill race . Thousands of square miles of salt lagoons and an entire river basin were to be filled in a few hours , and all through one lean nostril . It appeared to Anthony that the slight rise in the forest beyond was where the earth was expanding its chest in order to inhale the tide . The water about the schooner boiled with white sand . All sail had been stripped from the ship , which now glided forward rapidly and silently on the swiftly rising water floor . They crossed the wide lagoon behind the island in a few minutes and entered the boiling , sucking mouth of the Rio Pongo . Instantly on both sides the great forest closed in upon the little ship . The roar of the beaches was cut off as if the soft , oozy mouth of the river had closed its lips over her . Anthony had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unbelievable heights overtopping the ship 's masts , he could not guess how far . The Ariostatica seemed to be slipping down a throat lined with smooth , green vegetation into the mysterious maw of the continent . She swung around curves easily and majestically as if driven by some power within her , bubbling along on the advancing crest of the tide . No one but an experienced pilot could have avoided the sandbars of the sluggish river 's innumerable turns . Anthony glanced at Jaumee glad to see that Ali Bongo was getting on so well with him . Evidentlythey were about to reach an agreement . In a few minutes he witnessed a curious ceremony . Each man produced a knife and after repeating some formula each pricked his own thumb . When a drop of blood appeared they then thrust them each into the other 's mouth . Then they exchanged knives . Both spat upon the blades and saluted each other . The pilot then walked over and kicked the two naked Kru boys who were stretched out asleep in the blinding sun . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serve out arms now , I think , senor . " It was Ali Bongo who was speaking . Anthony turned to him startled , the man had come upon him so silently . " I have just made a blood brother of the pilot . He and his two boys there are now with us . You will have to provide the three rolls of red cloth I have promised . It is a great gift but their help is worth it . If the senor will act quickly now I think he can secure the ship . I will bring my men aft . The rest of the crew are at morning mess . " He gave a keen whistle which brought the four other Mohammedans , who lived mostly on rice , and who ate and cooked by themselves in the galley , running aft . Anthony looked about him mentally mustering his forces . Besides himself he had Juan , Ali Bongo and his four other Foulahs , the pilot , and his two Kru boys . It was possible that the cook and his boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brother Francois was , of course , in event of any physical clash , neutral . This was twelve at best , probablyonly ten in fact , that could be counted on to act together against the rest of the ship 's company including the captain and mate . The odds were thus about three to one . In Anthony 's favour was the rather unusual height of the schooner 's quarter-deck , which had only one narrow approach from the waist of the ship , and the fact that most of the ammunition , although not all of the arms , was stored in the cabin . Anthony sent Juan and one of the Foulahs to bring up an arms chest . Without attracting the notice of the crew weapons were quietly served out to those on the quarter-deck . Several loaded musketswere concealed in the bunt of the half-furled mainsail . As luckP546 would have it , just while this was going on the head and shoulders of the mate Soller appeared above the hatch combing . He was about to come on deck . He took in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the captain . Just then Ali Bongo clapped a pistol to his ear and hauled him on deck . He bound him to the mast and gagged him . Anthony , and Juan dived down the hatchway . They were too late , however . A scuttling noise and the rattle of irons in the cabin-hold told what was happening . They were only in time to see the manacled leg of Polypheme disappear through the loose board in the bulkhead . Leaving Juan to nail up the loose plank , which he cursed himself for not having attended to before , Anthony returned to the deck by way of the cabin . The captain had gone , too . Evidentlyhe had preceded Polypheme . The crisis was at hand then ! l le ran for the deck . As he poked his head up out of the hatch there was a deafening smack , and a bullet , which shattered the top of the combing , filled his cheek with wood splinters . He saw the captain standing on the fo'c'sle with a smoking pistol in his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reload . Everyone on the quarter-deck , including Ali Bongo , was now flat as a card . The pilot had let the wheel go and the bow of the Ariostaticawas pointing toward the bank . The tide luckily enough drifted her sidewise upstream . Anthony seized the wheel and turned the ship 's head up the river again . The captain was having great trouble reloading . His hands and arms waggled out from behind the mast , working feverishly , Grabbing one of the muskets from the sail Anthony sent a bullet in the captain 's direction that tore a long piece out of the mast behind which he stood . The shot was too much for the captain . He let out a wailing whoop and ( lived for the fo'c'sle . His appearance there , which was greeted by an encouraging roar from the crew , had been enormouslyaccelerated by Ali Bongo 's firing a pistol at him as he fled . All this had happened in less than two minutes . Ali Bongo now came to life . He even persuaded his " blood brother " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who meant business , the rest of the men on the quarter-deck now ventured th raise their heads above the bulwarks and to handle their arms again It was hurriedly explained to them that any further faltering on their part would result in their being hanged by the captain , if , and as soon as , he regained the quarter-deck . It was now win or die . This pro found thought served to accelerate their zeal considerably . Even the Kru boys could understand it . Indeed , their new flood of courage and enthusiasm over the success Of the first blow went too far , The mere appearance of a head at theP547entrance to the fo'c'sle was the signal for an unauthorized hail of shots , from the quarter-deck . Some of these , fired from behind Anthony , passed close to his ear . The fo'c'sle howled like a den of hyenas for a minute or two and then was quiet again . Now was the line to rush the quarter-deck if they had only known it . Every weapon aft was empty . It gave Anthony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exerted himself strenuously to put some discipline in his mob . The muskets and pistols were reloaded hastily . Some packing cases and bales were brought up and disposed as a breastwork along the forward rail of the quarter-deck . The four Foulahs who were used to muskets , to judge by the way they handled them , were placed behind this hastily constructed but effective enough barrier with instructions to shoot at anyone who appeared in the fo'c'sle door . Spare muskets were provided . One of the Kru boys was sent down to reinforce Juan at watch below at the loose bulkhead . That bulkhead caused Anthony a good deal of worry . He did not want to have to meet a sudden rush from behind up the cabin stairs . The danger was thoroughly impressed upon Juan who began to make certain preparations . His ingenuity , Anthony found later , was considerable . In the meantime , the ship , as if nothing extraordinary were going on , continued calmly enough to sweep on up the river with the tide . A babble of voices occasionally burst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to go on for several hours that morning . Considerable difference of opinion as to what should be clone under the circumstances must have developed between the captainand the now thoroughly reckless Polypheme . That was as much as Anthony could make out . An intermittent pounding and smashing of glass , upon which Juan for some reason was engaged in the cabin below , drifted up the hatch . Anthony was glad now that Soller and the captain had freed Polypheme . Doubtless that was why the mate had stayed below so long that morning . It must have taken some time to file the locks on the Frenchman 's irons . He discovered later that the man 's leg chain had been cut through . Soller had evidently meant to come on deck to make talk while the captain and Polypheme went forward to bring back the crew . What had been done , then , was just in the nick of time . Anthony had counted on the captain 's waiting to act till they reached Gallego 's . That had almost been a fatal mistake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been now if he had waited ? A glance at the monster-haunted river did not reassure him . They were now passing rapidly enough up a long , straight stretch of the stream . Except for the muddy shallows along the banks theP548 Rio Pongo here resembled a broad canal rather than a river . This reach in particular was literally dragon-haunted . From time to time , disturbed by the passing of the ship , crocodiles launched themselves from the banks with a resounding splash that sent flocks of parrotscreaming above the treetops . From a reedy shoal the pink , cave mouth of a riverhorse opened suddenly and bellowed at them . A cal like a huge , fat grub appeared swimming at its mother 's side . " 1 ' smoke from the ship 's galley had drifted into their nostrils . Monkey let themselves down by the natural ropes of vines that dangled a looped for interminable miles along the vast living wall of tree They dipped their hands in the muddy stream and drank , only shrink back chattering as they saw the ship , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to be a half-sunken log . The was not a breath or any movement in the leaves now . The clamp he vibrated above the stream with thousands of midges and living trot of things . Clouds of stinging flies made the men swear and stain Butterflies only to be matched by the cascades of bloom on the flows ing vines that made the walls of the forest both magic and impenetrable , fluttered down on the deck and waved their wings slowly i the sun . The dark , festering swamp , from which this prototype o tropical forests drew gargantuan life , smoked under dim arches midday with little wisps devoured by the sun . Even in the midst of burning excitement Anthony looked at all thin with amazement . To what place had he come ? While the four Foulahs crouched ready behind their bales of cloth and packing case he smiled to see that neither the battle which had gone on above hi head nor the semi-infernal landscape through which the ship wa passing had prevented the cook from preparing his usual meal . Th galley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copper caldrons the salt pork bubbled and sang . At dinner time a pai of white trousers on a stick was waved from the fo'c'sle . After some preliminary parley Polypheme 's face and single eye appeared a little above the deck forward . " You will not starve us , will you , senor ? " he said taking off his r cap and bowing with elaborate irony . The four guns of the Foulahs were trained at his chest but he paid no attention to them . He stood there holding the ball and chain that was still attached to his leg , grinning , and looking at those on the quarter-deck with a malevolent eye . He succeeded in making them all uneasy . " Send the captain up . I 'll talk with him , " said Anthony . " I am the captain now , " replied the man putting his hand on his heart and bobbing again while his chain clanked . " If you have any business to transact with the crew , monsieur , you must do it with Inc.  |p549Mais  oui , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swaggered a little , allowing the news to sink in . " Put the captain on deck . I talk only with him , " snapped Anthony in French . " Ah , zat ees endeed unfortu-nate , Meester Adverse , ze cape-tain hav chess now , what you call eet hexpire . His noble heart hav stop beat . I tell you zat in your own goddam langweedge . It ees ze verity . Let me talk wiz you . I have ze bon pro-posal . " He started to come aft . " Careful , senor , " whispered Ali Bongo . Anthony halted the man just by the carronade amidships and kept him covered . " You and me , we get togezzer now ze captain ees dale . . . " the sailor began . " You 're lying , of course , " interrupted Anthony . The single eye narrowed to a slit . " No ! I swear eet , on my heart , monsieur . " He bowed again slightly . His hand shot out of his chest . Anthony threw himself backward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handle instead of the blade of Polypheme 's knife which took him full in the chest . A number of muskets went off together like one gun . The four Foulahs had fired straight into the fo'c'sle door . It had stopped the rush effectively . Forward someone could be heard screamingdismally . Despite a fusillade of shots which followed him , in the tense excitement Polypheme had dodged back again . Anthony rose both bruised and foolish . To have had the same trick played on him twice ! He picked up the knife and threw it into the sea . It was just then that the noise broke out below . Evidently a scrimmagewas going on in the hold . Suddenly it stopped . Then there was one shot . As he started down the ladder Anthony met Juan coming up . He was laughing . " It 's all over , " Juan said . " I do n't think they 'll come back . " He began to laugh again . " It was glass , senor . Broken bottles ! I spread them in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You should have heard the noise they made when I fired through the bulkhead . They all rolled over each other in the most fertile spot . Bare feet , too , Madre ! " " Was it indeed all over ' ? " thought Anthony . Unconsciously he found himself thanking the madonna , his own madonna , that it was not all over with him . His wishbone creaked where the knife handle had bruised him . A fine place he had brought himself  --  and the madonna to ! Then he found himself laughing with Juan from sheer relief . A few minutes later the voice of the captain was heard begging for water for the wounded.  |p550  E " They bleed down here badly , sefior  --  for the love of Christ ! " An thony allowed this request . The return of the expedition from the hold had evidently sickened the fo'c'sle pretty thoroughly . He let the cook take some food down to them . Silence settled down upon the , Ariostatica now . Her progress up the ' Rio Pongo was no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose in cloudy flocks . The tide was nearing the flood . The ship moved upstream more and more sluggishly . They drifted slowly past the establishment of Mongo Tom . The forest opened out suddenly and a vista of rice fields , sugar cane , and plantains swept up to a large palisaded place , the slave pens . On a knoll was a comfortable-looking thatched house with a far-flung veranda . Anthony sent Juan for his glass . He could see a large figure , apparently that of a white man dressed in a loose garment of some kind , standing on the porch . The man was also looking at the ship with a hand telescope . Anthony made a gesture to him but he got no reply . Strangely enough no one else could be seen about . The place seemed deserted . " Mongo Torn no like him people come say how-do Gallego ship , Many man 's there alri ' , " replied the pilot to Anthony 's questions . Evidently there had been no love lost between Mongo Tom and Gallego . " Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jaumee , " Jaumee free man , " he added proudly . " Me do ! Me work Gallego ship ! " Anthony nodded approval of these independent sentiments . " Ale free man , me do ! " he thought and smiled . A canoe appeared at a turn ahead , waved a paddle , and turned hack upstream . A few minutes later the pulsing throb of distant drumming seemed to emanate from the forest from all directions at once . " Bangalang , " said Jaumee . The drums went on . The crew in the fo'c'sle began to call out . What was going to happen to the garrison on the quarter-deck , and Anthony , in particular when the ship reached Gallego 's barracoon was not only described graphically but with obscene originality . It was Anthony 's intention to nurse this delusion of the approaching revenge of the defunct Sefior Gallego . It fitted in with his plans for getting both the captain and the crew ashore without . further deck fighting when they reached the Gallego establishment . It was no part of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deck before the ship anchored . As they approached Bangalang and several head began to appear at the fo'c'sle hatch from time to time , he had one of the Foulahs fire another warning shot . As the fo'c'sle hatch , a sliding door , was exactly opposite the quayp551ter-deck , which faced it at an elevation of about ten feet due to the build of the ship , the effect of musketry from the quarter-deck only half a ship 's length away was to plunge bullets directly into the fo'c'sle . They spattered against the forward bulkhead there with a devastating smack and a hail of oak splinters . There was even a certain humour in this situation , provided one was on the quarter-deck . In order to protect themselves the crew had to keep the vertical , sliding hatch to the fo'c'sle closed ; in order to sally forth or shoot back they had to open it . The opening of the hatch always announced itself by a loud screech of its ungreased rollers . By the time it was fully open , after several squalling jerks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gaping door . Anyone who wanted to come up the fo'c'sle ladder then , and die at the top , was at liberty to do so . Anthony reflected with a good deal of amusement and a curious chagrin that upon the combination of these very simple physical facts both his present and his future existence were entirely dependent . In several languages he could think of only one phrase adequate to describe the situation . " On les a . " When the drums began announcing the nearness of Bangalang and the end of the voyage , the forward hatch had been slid back in order to allow the profane advice of the fo'c'sle to reach the quarter-deck . As the loudness of the drums increased , showing the Ariostatica was nearly opposite the native town , the disposition of the crew to sally forth became imminent . A few heads were even risked above the level of the deck . At the same time a fleet of canoes making for the schooner appeared around the bend of the river just ahead . It was at this juncture that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstration was effective . Silence from the fo'c'sle and an outbreak of firing in the town around the bend greeted the volley . The firing from the town was merely by way of a happy greeting to the long-expected ship . Bangalang , according to Ali Bongo and the pilot , was a village of Krus , a tribe of coastal negroes , mostly fishermen , who were of great service to both the slave establishments on the Rio Pongo . They had consequently been let alone . Slaves came from the interior . So there was nothing hostile in the approaching canoes , quite the contrary . Nevertheless , Anthony did not intend to permit natives to board the ship at this time . If necessary he intended to skip a few shots over the water to make the canoes sheer off . A happier idea was supplied by Ali Bongo , however . Several small kegs of rum were tied to a spare spar and set adrift . The canoes when they approached were warned off and the kegs pointed out . A few minutes later as the Ariostatica drifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to divide four kegs between them . M u i fled shouts from the fo'c'sle did not attract their attention . The river now widened out into a series of lake-like tidal marshes . As the ship came in sight of the village , situated on an island knoll about a mile away over the flats , the drums in the place changed from a monotonous turn-turn , turn-turn , to a swiftBonk , bonkty-bonk-bonk , Bonk , bonkty-bonk-bonk. endlessly repeated . Horns and screams of welcome joined in . It was just at this point that Anthony felt a final crisis with the crew might occur . Everything depended on reaching Gallego 's anchorage about four miles beyond the town . At her present rate of drifting it would take the ship an hour to do that , two hours perhaps . The tide was fast failing . He now sent two of the Foulahs forward to cover the fo'c'sle hatch point-blank and managed to slip Juan up the forward ladder to set the jibs . Over the miles of open flats breezes now and then rippled the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm . The ship increased her way considerably . The rattle of the jib blocks on the deck and the drums of the village caused Polypheme to make another attempt . He raised his head above the deck level and found the single eye of a musket looking directly into his own . It was sufficient to convince even him utterly . Nevertheless , the tension of that last hour was extreme . It was n oI until the schooner rounded a long , wooded point , and Anthony could look across another bay in the forest to the long barracoons of the late Senor Gallego , that he began to feel he might yet win . A few minutes more , and he would have had to anchor below the point and hold the crew below all night . In the darkness almost any thing might happen . As it was , assisted by some puffs that filled the jibs for several blessed moments at a time , he just made it . The Ariostatica was brought to anchor about seven hundred yard ' : from shore by a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthony was particular about this distance . The tidal basin here was about a mile across . Gallego 's place stretched along the water front where the stockaded barracoons stood . Various thatched houses attached to the establishment extended up a low , steep hill just behind . Many blacks , both men and women , could be seen running about greatly excited . On the porch of one of the houses farther up the hill Anthony 's heart sank to see what was appal ently the figure of a white man . Could Gallego be alive after all ? If so . . . " Him Ferdinando , Gallego factor , " said Jaumee . " Him half breed . " He spat on the deck.  |p553It  was curious that no boats were putting out for the ship , Anthony thought . There was not even a canoe by the docks . Whatever the reason was , it made things much simpler . Without further ado he intended to act . He had the two whaleboats slung in the schooner 's waist lowered and towed up to the bow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been tied to the mast , was now unlashed . In the excitement of the past five hours he had been pretty well forgotten . lie now staggered across the deck moaning for water . When he found Anthony intended to send him ashore with the crew he collapsed . His plight was pitiable . It was plain that he must know that Gallego was dead . He had heard Ali Bongo and the pilot talking , it seemed , and had put two and two together . He now pleaded earnestly to be allowed to remain on the schooner . " You will not send me to die like a dog on shore , will you , senor ? I see your game . To turn me and the captain loose on shore with those bastards below ! Dios , we shall be murdered ! I wo n't go ! I will serve you now . I can be valuable to you . I will be your man . . . " Anthony was forced to turn Soller over to Brother Francois who tended him in the cabin below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At any rate he was no good to negotiate with the crew . It must be either the captain or Polypheme . The captain would be easier to handle . After a hundred reassurances and seemingly helped by Polypheme from behind the little man was finally persuaded to come on deck . He was nervously shaken by the events of the last forty-eight hours . All his swagger was gone . He stood blinking in the sun in a sweaty , silk suit in which the colours had run . Yet it was strange to see how soon the ghost of his naturally cocky attitude began to return when he found he was going to be sent ashore with his crew . Anthony could see that Don Ramon still thought him a fool and could scarcely believe his ears or refrain from boasting about what he was going to do when once ashore . Anthony pretended to be driving a bargain . " In return for letting you go I shall expect you to put my own situationbefore Senor Gallego as  --  well , as pleasantly as possible , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , with absolute cordiality , depend upon it . Your generosity and tender treatment will be properly reported , have no doubt . I promise it on my honour . " " In this case I shall have to believe you . My situation , you see , makes me dependent upon you from now on , captain . I trust you understand my precarious position with Senor Gallego . " " Believe me I do , " grinned the captain in spite of himself . " Ip554wonder you did not think of it before . But I shall do my best , " he added hastily , seeing Anthony scowl . " Have your crew pile their arms on the deck then , as I said , and get into the boats one at a time . As a gentleman of honour you may keep your own sword . " Since the captain had lost his scampering through the hold early that morning the last shot was between his wind and water . He winced , seemed about to reply , then thought better of it and went below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppressed drifted up the hatch . In rather short order the crew then began to toss up on deck a heterogeneous collection of weapons . These were , hastily gathered up and taken aft . There was some parley over a musket which had not yet appeared . Finally it was tossed up with a curse . " One at a time now , " said Anthony . " At the first move . . . " A decidedly bedraggled departure now took place . As the men emerged one by one from the fo'c'sle they were sent alternately to one of the two boats and made to sit down on a thwart . Those who had bandaged and bloody feet from walking on Juan 's broken bottles looked especially glum and foolish . Both the procession and the boat$ were kept well covered by pistols and muskets . As there were twenty eight men in all it took nearly half an hour , thirty as tense minutes as Anthony ever lived through . Looking down in the boats , where the men were forced to sit with folded arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a cargo of pure hate . Polypheme and the captain came last . The former still carried his ball and chain , while the latter had found a cutlass far too long for him . He had taken Anthony at his word but tripped on the sword as he went over the side . Even his own men grinned at him . The tide had turned during these proceedings and the bow . of the ship was now downstream . The two boats , with the captain in charge of one and Polypheme of the other , were both at a signal suddenly cut loose . The ebb swept them clear of the schooner . They were carried fifty yards before the tired , dazed men realized what had happened , Then there was a great scramble for oars . A yell of derisive triumph went up from those on the schooner and a few wild shots which Anthony could not prevent spattered the water about the boats . Polypheme produced a pistol from somewhere and fired back . His bullet crashed through the stern windows . Yells , curses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , thrashing the water wildly , pulled out of range as fast as they could and made for the landing by the barracoons . It was not likely they would attempt to return immediately , Anthony thought . He counted on the confusion which would follow when theyp555learned that Gallego was no more . Above all he counted on trouble starting between the captain and Polypheme . There were gorgeous possibilities there . He himself would play a defensive game . He had the schooner now and could wait . He would consolidate his own gang and stand off the others . " Tomorrow , " he thought , "  --  and almost anything may happen on shore tonight  --  perhaps the final move can be made . " How thankful he was the tide had served them to the last . Undoubtedlyhe owed much to Jaumee 's skill . It would have been impossible to keep the situation in hand if he had had to anchor lower down and keep the crew below all night . Things had been too evenly balanced . As it was , they had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But to wait was not necessarily to be apathetic . He must keep himselfclear-minded and up to the mark , awake . And he must now be merciless , he felt . Above all he must supply the energy to drive things through . Already his little garrison was drowsing about the deck and dozing from heat and fatigue . He stripped and poured several buckets of water over himself . He took a pull of brandy , and then lit a black cigar to quiet his nerves . He roused the men again by serving out some grub and a good tot of rum to each . Under Jaumee 's supervision he set them to work getting up boarding nettings while he and Ali Bongo put the carronade amidshipsinto working order . Powder , round shot , and grape were got up and placed handy . As the ebb increased the Ariostatica had dragged on her small stern anchor and increased her distance from shore . This was now brought up . The large starboard anchor was let go , and the ship 's head brought upstream with only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capstan would free her now , yet the heavier anchor held her fast . By five o'clock all was shipshape again . The boarding nets were rigged , cutlasses , and loaded pistols and muskets ready at hand . A number of lanterns and flares were made ready , and a large kettle of boiling water kept steaming in the galley . Anthony and Ali Bongo had also spent some time training the carronade on various objects . It had very simple sights and one hand screw for elevation . They now recovered it , leaving the lashings off its tarpaulin and the gun loaded . It was now time to think of his men again . He got up a ship 's chest and served out new clothes . He gave the Kru boys their bolts of red cloth and the Foulahs the merchandise he had promised them . In addition he presented the Mohammedans with a small roll of lead and a bullet mould apiece . He gave Ali Bongo the captain 's silver watch , which he had left behind , and from a chest of trinkets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round of rice and boiled meat followed.  |p556  While all now sat about on the deck with expressions for which " satisfaction " was too lean a word , the fortune to be made by sticking by the ship was made clear and the disasters of failure again point out in strong terms . A blatant dose of praise mixed with a few cull threats for those who might shirk , or go to sleep on watch , completed Anthony 's first speech . A burst of cuckooing from the pilot 's clock just at the end brought a roar of good-humoured laughter from all hands . The crew was divided into watches under Ali Bongo a Jaumee and went willingly to their stations . So far nothing but distant shouts and the barking of a dog had rot from the shore . The barking now reached a crescendo of excitementLeaving Juan in charge of the deck Anthony went below for I glass . He found Brother Francois attending So11er who was now better but still with a rather bad touch of sun . Even the bullet through the cabin windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deck with Anthony . He showed no curiosity t surprise . He sat in his chair and looked out over the wide stretch 0 jungle-lined water which the sun was now flooding with level rays it neared the western palm-tops . He offered no comment . Anthony wondered what he was thinking about . How useless he seemed here ! Perhaps the priest 's seeming apathy was due to that , perhaps he sensed his helplessness here himself . The tremendous brutal lushness of the tropical landscape all about seemed to oppose itself to Brother Francois . Against the scale of things here he seem insignificant . But when he had once focused the glass on the scene ashore Anthott soon forgot all about the man who sat beside him . The short distant . between the ship and the shore was only sufficient to provide a dramatic perspective . Through the glass everything , even small objects , wt very clear and apparently close at hand . But he could hear nothing except the dog barking . The animal was now frantic about something . He began to search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the water front and then up the hill . Now he was on it . It was at the dwelling house half-way up . What was going on there was absorbing enough . P557A WHIFF OF GRAPESHOT THE dog , a small , lean animal whose capacity for clamour seemed out of all proportion to its size , was tied to a pillar of the veranda , straining at its leash . The cause of its indignation and fury was the approach of the main body of the crew . They had now left the barracoons and stockade below and were climbing the hill toward what was evidently the master 's quarters half-way up the first slope . It was a thatched building of generous proportions . A number of blacks , both men and women , could be seen leaving the place from the rear carrying various belongings . The exodus was a general and hasty one . The figure of the man Ferdinando appeared at the main door once and then withdrew hastily again . Then the captain came out and stood with folded arms . He still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tore a small gate off its hinges , and followed by the rest rushed up a short garden path . They stopped short at the porch . The hound was baying frantically . Some argument now took place with the captain . The little man waved his arms wildly . His words seemed to be having effect . He drew his sword . Several of the men clinched and started to roll over and over . Whether fists or knives were being used Anthony could not tell . Suddenly Polypheme stepped out from the crowd and drew his pistol . The captain dropped his sabre and turned for the door . There was a puff of smoke and the captain crumpled . Then the crack of the pistol reached the Ariostatica . The men swarmed like hornets into the house . The hound had apparently gone insane . Outside two figures lay in the little garden path before the porch . The crack of the pistol on shore had brought all hands to the starboardrail of the schooner . Some few seconds later two figures dashed out of the house followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . Anthony could not fix the glass on them , but in one he thought he recognized Ferdinando . The other seemed to be a woman , a young and active one it appeared , for she outdistanced her pursuers rapidly and disappeared into a clump of palms near the river front . The man was not so lucky . He was headed off and hunted amid whoops and a great clamour for some time about the sheds near the P558 slave pens . His hiding place was evidently discovered once , for the shouting broke out anew . Then it quieted down . Some of the crew kept looking about , but in about ten minutes they gave it up and trooped back to the house on the hill . The cause of further lack of interest in their quarry was now apparent . A shed had been burst open and some barrels rolled out . number of kegs loaded on the backs of slaves were soon seen ascending the hill to what was now quite patently the headquarters of Polyphi. and his gang . That worthy soon appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kegs rolled in . He then , to judge by tP noise , devoted a full five minutes to kicking the hound to death . It was curious , but the screams of the unfortunate animal did more to weld the crew of the Ariostatica into a unit against Polypheme an the men on shore than anything that had happened so far . None C the incidents of the fight coming up the river nor the miserable sight of wounds and blood which it had produced could be compared withAnthony remembered the cries of the child which had been trampled by the French cavalry at Livorno and their effect upon Toussaint Evidently it was the voice and not the sight of suffering which iii W moved men . Ali Bongo who stood beside him at the rail listening clutched the shrouds till the veins on his wrist stood out . And he w a Mohammedan who held dogs accursed . As the agonized voice finally ceased it now seemed to Anthony himself that he was engaged in holy war , and that behind the taking of the schooner and the capful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object , there was now splendid moral urge . The cool murder of the captain seemed nothing in comparison with the nerve-shattering death of the dog . The captain had died silently so far as those on the schooner were concerned , and he was a man . Polypheme , in short , had now given notice to all coq cerned that he no longer kept even a sensible contract with nature . A were concerned . " Senor , " said Ali Bongo , " tomorrow we make One-eye go t Allah about that . Allah can listen . " He drew his finger across his throat significantly . They nodded to each other with complete under- standing . " Well , my son , how is your plan getting on with itself ? " said Brother Francois to Anthony a minute or two later . " Very well ! " snapped Anthony , who was still leaning over the sit looking shoreward . Something ironical in the priest 's voice hi aroused a host of questions in himself which he had thought we asleep . He was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better himself , under the circumstances , when three nu emerged from the shore sheds and started to make a bolt for it towardp559the landing where the two whaleboats from the schooner now lay without a guard . A wild whoop from some of the crew on the hill gave notice that they were seen . The distance from the sheds , and from the house on the hill to the dock was about the same . The three fugitives , whoever they were , had the advantage of a considerable start . Unfortunately , however , the two boats were not tied close together at the dock . They had only ime to hurl themselves into the first and shove off before the crew was swarming out of the barracoon gate just behind them and making for the remaining boat farther down the dock . The men in the boat pulled as rapidly for the ship as their desperationcould contrive . They had already put a good stretch of water behind them when the craft manned by Polypheme and his gang shot out behind them pulling strong . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the carronade and were trying desperately to bring it to bear on the pursuing boat . This was not so easy to do . They had left the carronade at too high an angle . The hand screw which controlled its elevation proved rusty and stiff . Before the elevation could be shifted to water level and the gun trained , the crew were gaining fast . The boat ahead , rowed awkwardly by only three oars , seemed about to be overtaken and capturedbefore the eyes of those on the schooner . It was just at the moment when the gun finally came to bear full on Polypheme 's boat that Anthony remembered they had no lighted match . He turned with a groan . Ali Bongo was gone . Just then he emerged from the galley tossing a blazing coal from hand to hand . " Keep her on ! " he shrieked . Anthony peered over the sights again . His target in those few seconds had rowed past . He slewed the gun desperately at a guess . Ali Bongo dropped the coal on the touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaped back into the air against its tackles . A million waterfowl rose screaming from the marshes . About ten feet before Polypheme 's boat a round shot struck the water a stunningblow , half drowning its crew with sheets of spray and caroming off into the wall of the barracoon beyond with a tremendous crash of splitting wood . For several minutes nothing could be heard but the screams of myriads of birds and the wail of women from the shatteredbuilding on shore . Anthony could hear nothing at all . He was deaf but he was laughing . All of Polypheme 's men had " caught a crab " at the same instant . P560 Their oars seemed to stick in the water and fight with them . ' Then they had rowed all ways at once . Now they were making back for the shore thrashing frantically . If they could only get there before those on the ship could reload the terrible gun ! They did so . All Bongo was dancing from the pain in his scorched fingers . Anthony was helpless . About the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big gate of the barracoon the boat they had htpursuing made fast to the ship . Its three exhausted rowers pro ve to be the half-breed Ferdinando and two stout blacks . Anthony welcomed them although he could just then hear nothing they had to say . Nevertheless , from the very first he liked Ferdnando . Gallego 's chief clerk , or factor , as he was called , carried hit self like a man . Despite his pale lemon complexion , small feature ' and dainty hands and feet , his main impression was one of intelligent and energy . His face was both refined and forceful and he evidently took great care of himself . Somewhat bedraggled now , his first care when they descend to the cabin was to wash and put his dark curls in order . A den white suit which Anthony lent him went far toward winning hi heart . Anthony did not realize it then , but to have been reedy thus by the white man in charge of the ship with courtesy and solid tude had reached the half-breed factor where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun had sunk . Darkness descended upon the forest-river Ian as if a curtain had been lowered . A thousand mysterious noises am of night birds , monkeys , and an occasional deep bellow from the riv banks which drifted in through the cabin windows of the schooner where Anthony , Brother Francois , and Ferdinando now sat at tliel evening meal . Downstream over the low point Anthony could sec t glow of the village fires waving in the sky and the monotonous In frantic drumming gradually became audible again as his ears cleared . Juan kept a sharp lookout on deck and repeated that there was nothing to be seen ashore except a few lights and an occasional shout f runt the house on the hill . Ferdinando joined genuinely in Brother Francois 's brief grace . regarded his own presence at that meal as little short of marvellous . A recital of events on shore that afternoon soon confirmed the others in , . this opinion . The captain upon landing had left the crew in the sheds below while he had climbed the hill to Gallego 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning that Gallego had been thoughtless enough to die two months before were indescribable . The factor said he had never seen anything quite like it . " It was a curious thing to watch , senor . You can imagine my ownP561state of mind , too , with that one-eyed dog and his sons-of-bitches hanging around about the sheds below  --  waiting . At any moment they might find out that Gallego was dead . Both of us knew what would happen without having to be told . I can tell you , you came in for some hearty cursing . We were caught like pigs in a pit by your little trick . I suggested arming some of the slaves and started some of the house servants hiding the valuables . There was Senor Gallego'sbig cash chest in which he kept the silver trade dollars . We started to smuggle it out the back . " It was just then we heard them coming , senor . Either someone had told them about Gallego , or they saw the chest . I can not understandDon Ramon . What kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yell and the dog started to bark the captain was so frightened he turned green . It is death ! ' he said . Then he vomited all over the room . He had just had a bottle of red wine . He fell down . Then he got up again and took his sword . I have my honour , ' he shouted . I laughed at him then , God forgive me ! He went out on the porch and folded his arms . Senor , he made the crew a grand speech . Some of them fought for him . He died like a brave man . You know how . " The factor crossed himself . " As for me , I did not wait . No use . When I heard that pistol shot I called my sister from her room and we made for the little creek behind the palms . Since Senor Gallego died we have had great trouble here . A number of our people kept slipping away at night to the village . I had all the boats and canoes towed around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no boats came out to you . You see I have been much worried all along as to what would happen when the Ariostatica arrived . Well , it has been much worse than I thought ! " He ran his slim fingers through his curls . " Much worse ! Only the devil knows what that froth-of-hell will be up to tonight . It is trade rum they broke into , fourth proof  --  barrels of it . Madre ! " " Where is your sister now ? " " Well hidden , I trust , senor . Ah , she is a clever girl , do not worry ! She will not be caught like a chicken in a coop . Besides there are plenty of women in the barracoons . It is fire that I am worried about . f it once gets started in the thatch ! " He put down his glass , pausing at the thought . " But who are you , senor , and how did you come here ? " He looked up now a little apprehensively . With great care , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , Anthony explained his position and the events of the voyage . Ferdiandosat listening amazed . On the face of Brother Francois now and then Anthony thought he detected a faint flicker of amusement . It did take a great deal of explaining.  |p562  " So it is your plan then , senor , to assume charge of the factory here ? " said Ferdinando at last . " Since Senor Gallego is dead I can scarcely do anything else , can I ? In fact I find myself in charge already , do n't you think ? " Anthony replied . The factor laughed a little wryly . " Undoubtedly it is true , " he said . Then he looked up turning a little white , but with determination enough . " And what of me ? " he said . " You will remain on as you are now , " replied Anthony . " I ha already made up my mind to that sometime ago . I see that yo are  --  a gentleman ! " " You are the first that has ever said so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looking Anthony in the face . " I sit never forget it ! " Anthony went on deck and left Ferdinando talking with Broth Francois . He was glad to see that Juan had bountifully fed the tw black boys who had come aboard with the factor . They squatted by the galley scooping rice out of a bucket with their own horn spoon which they habitually wore in their hair . They grinned at him an he nodded hack . It was no small reinforcement he had gained . ' 1 ' 1 odds against him were now only about two to one . The night wore on quietly enough . Ali Bongo and his watch r lieved Juan 's . Ferdinando came on deck and they talked for hour An enormous amount of information was to be culled from the factor He was certainly a valuable man . Yes , he had been born here  --  Bangalang . Bangalang . His father had been the captain of one of old Sell Gallego 's ships . " A gentleman , senor , a Castilian . " Of his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered how Ferdinand could be so sure that all was going well with her on shore . If it ha been Anthony 's sister , for instance . . . or was the half-breed merry indifferent ? The moon came up very late , only a remnant of herself red and inflamed , looking through the fog that settled over the treetops . An increased roaring and howling of tribes of monkeys inundated the night . At Bangalang the tireless tom-tomers and drummers change , their rhythms again . Those drums ! Not a sign on shore yet . Only the lights up at the residence and a few drunken shouts now and then . The barracoons lay miserably dark and silent . Anthony went below and got his boat cloak and a thin blanket for Ferdinando . There was a certain damp-coolness from the river equiv. alent to cold . One felt it in the lungs . Ferdinando spoke of the agile . " You will probably die of that , senor . They all do who come litre , sooner or later . Do you smell the forest ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miasma that gets in your bones . It is a very unusualp563season here , the rains have been delayed ; intermittent . Usually it pours for weeks at a time . " " You seemed to have survived , " murmured Anthony . " Ah , that is different . A dash of . . . " Ferdinando bit off another igar . He enjoyed the fresh Havana immensely . Anthony also inhaled slowly . It kept him awake and soothed at the same time . He realized as he leaned back and began his fourth cigar that night how much tobacco had come to mean to him . Here he could see it might come to mean even more . One would need it . A little brandy was also helpful , he found  --  on a night like this  --  a very little of course . He passed the flask to his companion who agreed . Brother Francois went forward with a light and disappeared into the fo'c'sle . He stayed there a long time . Finally he came aft again . " Come , " said he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs apparently asleep . " I want to show you something . No , you , my son . " He motioned the half-breed back . Anthony followed Brother Francois into the fo'c'sle . The priest held up the lantern . There was someone huddled up in the forward bunk . The blood on the blankets was of a peculiar , dark purple colour , almost black , and shiny . It seemed terrible that the man 's hair was still dark and curly . It seemed to have a life of its own . The face was so dead  --  turned toward the wall and grey-ash coloured . It was one of the oldest of the crew . Yet he had somehow the expression of an infant now . It was also monkey-like . It needed life to make it bearable . Cold and only half awake as he was , Anthony felt the fear of it , a repulsion to the clay of it leapt up in him . " Who has done this ? " something asked . " This is really you  --  like you . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be overtaken by this fate . Beware "  --  and all the time he knew and tried to deny t himself that he had caused this . His mind to relieve him started to show him a map design in the bloodstains . There were the Cape Verdes and just east of it a large black-purple stain . A little too heart shaped for Africa , not perfect , nature scarcely ever did . . . The lantern moved and the shadow of the hunk swooped over the sleeper . Anthony saw Brother Francois was looking at him . " One of the crew , " he said mechanically . " I do n't know . They rust have left him here this afternoon . He may not have been dead then . They should have . . . Damn it ! Do you think it is my fault ? " he ripped out . The priest 's gaze angered him . Brother Francoisdid not reply . . . . " Well , what else could I do ? You know the circumstances . Would you just have stood by and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt sorry and angry now at the same time . " What is it you are trying to do ? " said Brother Francois . P564 " Collect a debt , " snapped Anthony . " Three shiploads of goods were . . . " " Look at the ledger now , " said the priest . He moved the lantern that the light fell into the bunk again . Anthony looked . They stood silent for a moment . The lantern guttered . " What is the use of talking about it ? " said he , and stalked on deck again . He felt vastly annoyed at Brother Francois . Let him l , ur ' the dead . Now ! Why keep on being reminded ? He roused A Bongo and gave directions . " Put two shots in the shrouds . . . before it gets light . " He was glad to be back on deck again . A great deal of shouting was going on on shore . He turned t watch that . " They must all be very drunk now , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They stood smoking for almost hal f : 11t hour . The door at the high house on the hill finally opened and di*. gorged a yelling mob . Several torches flared up from one . Then lot of them together started to come downhill . The shadows danced weirdly clear out over the water . A kind of Walpurgis procession accompanied by flaring pine knots born by staggering and capering figures was streaming downhill . The crew stopped now and then to shout hoarsely and argue with one another . Something was up . They ' .. seemed to be pushing a cart . The lights glinted on metal . About half-way down they all stopped short . A shed roof cut them ol ! , By climbing the shrouds , half-way up you could still see them from the schooner over the top of one of the water-front sheds . It was hart ! to tell what they were up to at that distance and in the waving light . Suddenly a streak of red fire dirked into the night . A round shot screamed through the rigging like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed . On the hill a cloud of sulphur smoke drifted back redly through the frantic torches . A wild shout of glee went up . " Madre de Dios , " said Ferdinando , " it is the saluting cannon , s five-pounder . Gallego kept it dismounted in the warehouse . " They could hear a fierce clamour in the barracoons now . Abner this the little gun spoke viciously again . A loud cracking started aloft followed by a dismal crash as the foretopmast tore loose and smashed along the deck . The hill clamoured with triumph . It was certainly the devil 's luck of a shot . " Get below , " shouted Anthony . There was no use exposing the men now . " The chances are in the darkness they wo n't hit us again , " said he to Ferdinando as they came down from the shrouds . " No , but on the other hand we ca n't reach them , " replied the factor . " You see from the deck here they are hidden up the slope just behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bongo gathered aboutP565the carronade . Nothing but the dim glow of torches showed over the shed on shore . " Shoot through the roof , senor , " suggested Ferdinando . " No , that will carry clean over them I am afraid . You see they are down the hill a bit and dropping their shot on us over the shed roof . It would take a mortar to fetch them from here . This long gun will not give us the angle . " A shot plunged into the bay and ricocheted over the schooner . " One mans on shore , him sober , " said Jaumee , who just then came tip to join the nonplussed group coolly enough . They all laughed a little wryly . " What do , Jaumee ? " " Wait morning-light , " grunted the laconic pilot wrapping his blanketabout him and sitting down in the lee of the bulwark . The advice seemed good . They could drop the ship downstream at dawn if necessary . It was uncomfortable sitting still , but risking grounding on a flat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then stopped . " About an hour till dawn , I take it , " said Anthony . " A little longer I think , senor , " replied Ferdinando . Then he leaped to his feet . A waving orange light was irradiating the water front . " They have fired the boat shed ! " cried the factor . " The powder ! " A long yellow flame licked through the thatch illuminating the water and making the Ariostatica stand out darkly . On her deck the long shadows leaped to and fro . The shed suddenly began to burn fiercely as a tar barrel in it commenced to vomit flames . The whole bay danced with reflections now . " Get the anchor up ! Juan , " shouted Anthony . The men began to tumble up . Strangely enough the shooting was not resumed yet from shore . " They are waiting for more light , " said Ferdinando . An explosion of the gun followed as if in answer . A maddening delay occurred getting the bars in the capstan . Then the clank-clank of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . An answering roar of voices came from the hill . The flames from the burning shed at that instant leaped higher . A full half of it was on fire now . A roaring and crackling came over the bay . Showers of sparks fled up into the stars . A white light beat along the water front . The dock and the barracoons behind it projectedthemselves clear as midday in a frame of blue darkness . Suddenly the big timber gate at the water front was flung open and some of the crew rushed out and started to shoot muskets at the schooner . They were gunning for the men about the capstan . Thep566 bullets splashed about . A beam in the shed fell sending up a fount of sparks . " Help , senor , " shouted Ali Bongo . " See ! " Anthony left the capstan and rushed to aid Ali Bongo at carronade . Racing aft he glanced over his shoulder . Through gate of the barracoon the rest of the crew was emerging rolling little five-pounder before them . " Allah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the content of a trader 's chest of notions into the carronade ; copper bangles , hr beads , knives , a small music box . It began to play " Richard , i ) n roi . " Out of the way , man , bring fire ! " Anthony laid the sight square on the gate . The crew were bunched there , swarming about the lit gun , a black writhing mass of men in the fatal glare . This tittle t match was ready . He blew on it . " Richard , Richard , 0 mon . . The two guns from ship and shore spoke at the same instal Splinters ripped from the bulwark of the schooner . Anthony felt t wind of the ball . But he had eyes for nothing but the fiery see ashore . In the gateway of the barracoon a wave of chains , toys , and slu had mowed the crew down like the blade of a whistling scythe . Not a sound could be heard except the crackling of the flame Everyone stood rooted gazing shoreward . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a thunderclap ; a long roar . The whole sh vaulted into heaven bellowing . In the intense glare of the powder explosion Anthony saw the who of Gallego 's place stand out like a landscape in a thunderstorm ; t long sheds with the solemn dark palms drooping over them , the residence with its wide porches , the black jungle-covered hills . " Mine ! " he cried . Darkness swooped ; sparks and hissing timbers rained into the bar He took a long , deep breath . The air felt cool just before dawn . Ill filled his lungs again to their usual rhythm . That had been disturbe only temporarily . Life in this new place was going to go on again. ; What were swift events ? Merely an interlude . As long as the lungs and heart went on one went on with them . That is , one resumed . And now at last he was master . Let the new day come quickly ! 11 leaned over the rail looking shoreward . From the forward deck of the Ariostatica came the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presently there was a splash , Anthony turned and went below . No matter what happened a man , had to sleep . Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow ?  |p567VIEWED  FROM G A L L E G O S FROM the porch of the " Residence " at Gallegos there was a sweeping view . The establishment lay on the first rise of ground inland . It was quite high enough to overlook the tallest treetops of the coastal jungle on the plain below it . At evening the sun could be seen flashing on the distant silver of the Atlantic that bounded its horizon westward . Also , Gallegos was high enough to catch the sea breeze at night . That was what made Gallegos possible for white men . Southward , you looked out over Gallegos Reach , a kind of tidal lake in the forest about a mile across , where the Rio Pongo widened out swirling slowly when the tide changed . You kept on looking  --  if it was not midday and the waters below turned into an intolerable blinding flash  --  over the mangroves on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wider reaches of the tidal flats and swampy islands about Bangalang lower down . The huts of the Kru settlement were built along a brief stretch of sandy beach on a low island . By day the long fisher canoes could be seen drawn up on the sand in regular rows , and by night the native fires wavered and twinkled through the river mists . Over the roofs of Bangalang , five or six miles away , the long slave pens of Mongo ' T'om 's establishment and the whitewashed house just above them stood out boldly from the clearing on the river bank which it occupied . Indeed , with a small glass , from Gallegos the slaves working in the manioc rows of the Mongo 's fields could be seen quite plainly . All the rest of the world to be seen from Gallegos was forest . A vast , flat sea of treetops marched northward hundreds of miles toward the doubtful boundary of Sierra Leone , and Freetown . The same boundless ocean swept without an undulation southward toward ( ' ' ape Palmas far over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only breaks in the flat roof of the forest below were a few loops of the river west of Mongo Tom 's where it suddenly narrowed again and twisted tortuously to the sea . Known to traders as the " Rio Pongo " from early Portuguese times , the river was called the Kavalli or Cavala by the various Kru peoples who inhabited the coast . Gallegos was in a great many ways a pleasant place at which to live . It was situated in a nest of low hills just where the river finally emerged from the plateau behind it and debouched into the lowlands ,  |p568The  ground here rose in three distinct steps from the stream . Along the river bank , on a flat a few hundred yards wide , were situated the dock with the various stores and sheds attached to it , and the long barracoons or slave pens , which occupied considerable space . From these the hill rose fairly steeply to a level horseshoe-shaped inset containing some fifty or sixty acres of rich , black soil . Behind that again the crest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy ascent . There the upland jungle began and stretched away eastward toward the unknown  --  or the " Mountains of the Moon "  --  if one preferred to take on faith the first object besides elephants and lions marked on the maps . At any rate , it was at this point that the trail from the interior emerged from the forest over which every year came Arab caravans with their human and other merchandise , which supplied the reason for Gallegos being a place at all . Not long after taking over the establishment Anthony had built himself a new residence . The old one , which Ferdinando now occupied , lay near the top of the lower rise and was constructed with wattled clay walls and a palm-thatch roof . One rainy season spent beneath its dripping cover , and many harrowing experiences with both white and red ants , had convinced Anthony of the necessity of a better abode . During the endless , dreary days when the rain fell for weeks at $ time he had amused himself by drawing elaborate and careful plans , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called it , but for the rehabilitation , of the whole establishment which the last Gallego , not much of a matt he soon learned , had allowed to fall into considerable disarray . Labour was no consideration on the Grain Coast . The slaves who would otherwise have been confined to the barracoons were set to work as soon as the dry season returned the first November after Anthony 's arrival . In the meantime experience had taught him n good deal about the country , and , as he sat late one afternoon on the porch of the new residence overlooking his domain , he felt justified in feeling that on the whole , for a new arrival , he had then planned well . Not that in the light of what he knew now , after longer familiarity , he would not do some things differently . The slave pens should have been further enlarged , for instance , and the dock extended . It would save a great deal of time and worry to have the ships tie up to the dock directly instead of anchoring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could have foreseen that things would go as well with him at Gallegos as they had ? Indeed , there had been that anxious four months the first year when he had not been sure that any ships would ever anchor at Gallegos atp569all .. Old Mongo Tom , too , had certainly made all the trouble he could . ' Thank the stars that was over with , the old dog ! Well , he was brought to heel now , and probably for good and all . For all practical purposes the entire landscape Anthony now looked over , from the new veranda at Gallegos to the Mongo 's fields six miles away across the bay was a very  --  well , a very Adverse one . Yes , on the whole , a great deal had been accomplished since the Ariostatica had pulled in three years before  --  agreat deal ! He leaned back in the ample cane chair and threw his palm hat on the floor . It had been a hot day and he had been all over the plantation . It was two months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that was to be expected . Also the irrigation helped . Now for a bath and a drink !  --  or a drink . Why wait ? The house servants brought back from Cuba had it too easy anyway . They needed a mistress . " Cheecha . " " Si , si , senor . " " Rum , and limes ! " " Si , si . " It was like Cibo to have sent him that girl . Well , he could well afford to as far as that went . Cibo had had his pick now out of many a shipload . Fourteen ships in three years ! And the fifteenth swingingat anchor below there now , La Fortuna , a new one to the trade . Ie hoped Cibo had not forgotten to send the right kind of trade goods . Another caravan was due soon , despite the nearness of the rainy season , and the stock in the warehouse was low . Not a slave in the pens and Mongo Tom had less than fifty , all old ones , too ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit a fresh Havana that had just come on La Fortuna  --  and enjoyedit greatly . The mould here did play the mischief with tobacco . The smoke drifted straight up to the ceiling . The sea-breeze would not be in for an hour yet . Twenty minutes after the sun went down the wind changed , by the clock . Gad , how well he knew the ways of the place now ; the seasons , the clouds , and the winds ; their rhythm ; the very look and smell of things ! In a few weeks the cloudless sky would commence to become a little hazy . Already the river mists were thicker at night . Then the clouds would begin to pile themselves up higher day by day . Great cliffs and mountains of them would finally tower up height beyond height till it was dizzying to look up into them . The sunsets were beyond thought then . Soon there would be lightning at night ; far-off thunder muttering . Then nights of a long battle-roll of it and on into the day , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They would dissolve into one grey pall , a few dropsP570 would fall , a shower , and  --  as if spigots had been turned on above one long month by month downpour . It did not seem to rain by drops . For three months it slanted past , and furiously down , as if each slant were an individual and perpetual jet from a hole in the skyBut it would be better this rainy season , the first in the new lion since it was finished . It might even be comfortable , and there won be a let-up in the perpetual man-hunt . There would be time to p things in order , to go over the accounts , and to make plans for one year . There would also be time to devote to Neleta ! No more surreptious meetings because of Ferdinando 's pride . That half-breed ! S was his sister ! What of it ? No , they would live together now in tit same house ! Brother Francois could look as sad as he wanted t Neleta would be housekeeper now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision that relaxed him in the chair . Ferdinando could not expect him to marry her . Marry her ? laughed . Ferdinando was making too good a thing of it as it was . I is was sorry now he had allowed him head-money on every cargo . It was enough for Ferdinando to have the run of the place as factor  --  and his sister was the mistress of the big house on the hill . What a fool he had been to wait so long to bring her up from her brother 's . It ha gotten to be like acting . Let her come and live with him . He wall master here . Master !  --  a rich one , too . To think that only three ' years ago he had been trying to collect a debt for Mr. Bonnyfeather  --  . and now . . . He let his eye wander over the ample plantation that lay just below the house . He had built the house well below the crest . The shadow of the bill behind it gave two extra hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ; the coffee , the rows of cassava ; cocoa , maize . yams , rice and eleusine ; pumpkins , gourds , cabbages , sweet potatoes , and okra . They flourished , and with only a little tending . Next year he would increase the acreage and put in indigo , cotton , sugar cane , and ginger ; enough manioc to supply the whole establishment . It would take a few more field hands but he was not going to ship every last man , woman , and child that came down with the caravans to Havana any more . No , he was in a position to hold back now and dictate a little . I le would build up a permanent establishment here and he would make it self-supporting . If anything happened to cut him off from Cuba he would be able to go along then on his own account . About twenty field hands , ten Foulahs for a garrison , and a few more house servants , well-trained ones , would do . This year would see the whole placep571stockaded . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crocodilecreek behind the hill to the river front . They swept clear around the place in a convincing horseshoe . With the next gang that came down he would stockade the creek bank , too . The thorn boma there was only good to keep out the chimpanzees . It was a relief to get rid of those rascals and the monkeys . Watchingbig Diana monkeys with the orange behinds ransack the new fruit orchards had been a trial . Shooting them from the front porch was all right by day  --  but in the morning ! Well , he was pretty well enclosednow , and by next summer he would have quantities of oranges , limes , and lemons . The papayas were already prodigious and there were shiploads of bananas . The cocoanuts , avocado pears , and figs one had to wait for . But not long . Now that the little zebra-goats could n't get in and girdle the trees any more ! They were devils . He wondered if Cibo had sent hint the pineapple cuttings . They ought to do well here . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air grew clear and the sun seemed to pull things up out of the earth by their tips  --  spring would see Gallegos the little paradise he had planned . No place on the whole Grain Coast would be like it . And he would live here with Neleta and keep on accumulating . Neleta would look after the house as it should be looked after . Some day he would go back , rich . He would settle in London or Paris , and live ! He would invite Mr. and Mrs. David Parish to dinner  --  to a very formal dinner under very fine chandeliers , a splendid place , butlers and lackeys , the Bonnyfeatherarms . Why not ? Perhaps Dolores would be at the other end of the table . But to give all this up now ; Neleta , the house ; not to see the growth next spring ; not to go up-country after being here three years ! Unthinkable ! Yes , it would be very lovely next spring , and it would pay , pay highly , to stay . After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't imagine that . One dinner with Florencewas not a life . The wild fowl were going now , going south . As he watched a great flight of them lifted from the reach below and made off over Cape Palmas way . The handsome little sparrow-hawks that lived on the rocky point above the mangroves seemed excited about it , too . But they stayed . In the spring all the ducks would come back , and the great black swans . The rains certainly could not be far off . He had forgotten the Christian calendar here . He told time only by the rhythms of the seasons . The swinging back and forth over the sky of the vast flocks of birds just before and after the rains , the slow ranging and rearrangement of the clouds , the shifting of the winds , and the gradual dying out of the intense green of the forest below him as the dry season advanced marked the passing of the year.  |p572  Even the stars failed him in these latitudes . They were all strange and much inferior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wandering planets and the moon came back like old friends . ' I ' sun was so fierce it seemed another sun . Gradually one learned thin about the tropical sun ; how friendly and how deadly it could he . Yes , he acknowledged to himself , he loved it all . Gallegos It become home . This month  --  he knew it was February from the man fest of La Fortuna  --  this month it had all , rather suddenly , been " home . " He knew he was going to be here a long time now . Perhaps Neleta 's coming to the house had something to do with it , b he was not sure . Perhaps ? He finished his drink , the early evening drink , that he had to admire now he depended upon . It made him feel himself again after the do in the sun . His face lost something of a certain mask-like quality had taken on . The yellow tinge that had grown under his tan faded . His eyes grew bright and the small red veins at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt now , after the rum and lime juice and sugar had taken lint of him , he felt as he had when he first came from Havana three yea ago . Why was it though , he could no longer get as much done in t day as he always planned to do the evening before  --  after the drink By noon it did not seem to matter . Last year it had not been th way . But , pshaw ! how could he feel better than he did now ? Al bronze , not an ounce of fat on him ! He put down the glass to wale the sunset . A drowsiness overcame him . The darkening blue dome of the sky with the black lines of birds streaming across it down to the lower range of the horizon beyond the two lakes slowly faded . The birds seemed to be going downhill from the top of a bowl . He closed his eyes . Half an hour later he wakened chilled by the sea-breeze and went in to change into dry clothes . He shivered slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one thing you should not do . It was almost dark now ; stars . He looked out of the window at the dank river mists gathering below . Fever lurked there . He took his drench of cinchona bark . Horrible stuff , bitter ! He killed the taste with a good swallow of brandy . Then he felt warm again . His feet lightenedunder him . He hustled into a heavy cotton evening suit and put on a cravat . The captain of La Fortuna was coming up to dinner tonight . Ferdinando would be up too to go over the ship 's manifests with him . It would be the first dinner when Neleta would sit at the table . How would Ferdinando take it  --  and Brother Francois ? Well , they could  --  take it . He shrugged his shoulders and went into the eating room , P573T H E MASTER OF G A L L E G O S DON RUIZ DE LA MATANZA , the captain of La Fortuna , which now lay anchored in Gallegos Reach , was a Toledan of ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided but a native hauteur about him . Only in a way was he glad to find himself in the merchant service  --  via a naval court-martial which could only be said to have been lenient . Even in the Spanish navy the practice of selling the cannon out of king 's ships for old bronze had to be discouraged , and the wrinkles in the official forehead had frowned Don Ruiz into the streets without even his sword left to protect his outraged honour . The terrible dilemmaof begging for work had made even a Matanza pliable , however , and after some years Don Ruiz wriggled himself onto a merchantman 's quarter-deck . A fine full-rigged ship was now his , La Fortuna . Originally built for the Manila run , she had splendid cabins and great hold space like the galleons on whose track she had followed . As a balm to his hurt pride Don Ruiz ran her like a king 's ship in all ways  --  except selling her cannon for about half what they cost . He had only consented to enter the slave trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the clever solicitations of Carlo Cibo at Havana . Anthony could see as soon as he entered the eating room that Captain Matanza was inclined to hold himself aloof . Mere slavers were evidentlynot his usual company . The very way he emphasized the " de la " in presenting himself showed that . And he was evidently nettled that only the factor Ferdinando had greeted his distinguished arrival . Anthony , however , had taken a leaf from the excellent book of John Bonnyfeather in how to receive and entertain ship captains . He no longer met the ships as soon as they anchored but sent out Ferdinando . He then received a report as to the nature of the ship 's commander , read personal mail which the vessel brought him , and with all necessary human and business details thus thoroughly in mind sent an invitation to dine to the captain . All this had its effect . If it did nothing else , it induced the more surly rascals among ships ' officers to recollect what decent manners their memories might still retain . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Master of Gallegos familiarityP574 was not in order , for as long as they lay at his anchorage , he held not only the whip hand , but the face cards in every little deal . To be invited to dinner at the new residence was therefore something too remember , and to talk about afterwards in Havana . Indeed , the approach to the new house had been planned somewhat for its " diplomatic " effect . A flight of broad steps hewn out of the living rock of the hill led up from the sheds and barracoons on the flat to a loopholed palisade on the level of the plantations . From this a straight road of beaten clay lined with giant funtumas already twenty feet high , so rapid was their growth , gave a clear vista to the house itself situated about an eighth of a mile across the cultivated fields of the little plateau and half-way up the final rise beyond . Ileyondthat the pointed posts of the palisade could be seen against the sky , crossing the hill in a bristling arc . The house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same clayey soil in which coffee flourished so well . It was absolutely four-square and surrounded on all sides by a veranda of noble proportionsset on natural pillars of dra=a trees . These had heett stripped of their bark , leaving the smooth , oily surface beneath to harden and glisten in the sun . The rafters of the roof and the porch were the same , making one sheer start from the peak of the roof to the eaves of the veranda . Anthony had covered them with red tiles which had been brought as ballast in an empty slaver from Cuba , Not only was this the only tile roof on the West coast , it was also the only rain and snake-proof house-cover in that part of Africa . The outer walls of the place were whitewashed . Seen from the anchorage , this house had the appearance of a large white tent with a red roof , the flag pole projecting from the centre court and the shadows under the poles of the veranda completing the illusion . It was only when it was approached closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A small trench supplied with flowing water , that was really only a defence against ants and other pests , completely surrounded it and gave it somewhat the look of a moated grange . The heavy shutters of the few outside windows might be seen by an observing person to be loopholed , set at commanding angles in the wall , and few and - far between . The door was small and would have taken a cannon to dislodge it . Indeed , the outer openings were scarcely more than holes for ventilation , and the house depended for both air and sunlight upon the large and beau tifully planted central patio , where a spring bubbled up , and to which the house was open internally on all sides . All these details had by no means been lost upon the ex-naval eye of Don Ruiz de la Nlatanza as he ascended the hill with Ferdinando . Nor did he fail to note the Foulah sentry protecting the stockade partP575pet with an elephant gun , nor two heavy culverins in concealed enclosureswhere a man kept watch night and day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little below the house round shot could he plunged onto the deck on any vessel below . In fact the whole establishmentand the river bays for several miles were subject to the ' nuzzles of those guns . Whatever else he might be , Don Ruiz had already decided before he entered the house that its owner was no fool . I I is experience at supper that night continued to strengthen this ( pinion . His impression of Anthony when he entered the room was that of a tall and powerfully slender . young man , the quiet assurance of whose hearing was rendered attractive and rather remarkable by his extreme ease of movement . A certain polished aloofness of manner , which to anyone but a Spaniard would have seemed a trifle old-fashioned , gave him a dignity that scarcely coincided with his years . This precocious gravity was really a projection of John Bonnyfeather rather than Anthony 's inward conviction of pride , but it had the effect of making others feel at first a little puzzled and uncomfortable and so constitutedfor Anthony at once a means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he spoke , which was not often , had now greatly deepened . It ranged when he was angry or scornful into the bass . Ordinarily it remained quiet , mellow , and clear . But he enunciated his words now with a certain assurance and precision not altogether pleasant . In two years the master of Gallegos had acquired the easy habit of command , but he had also lost a certain natural persuasiveness which had once been a positive charm . This , to tell the truth , he was not at all aware of . At first there seemed something hard-bitten about his face to a newcomerlike Don Ruiz . It was very  --  almost too regular in feature . The finely chiselled nose would have been too sensitive and feminine if it had not been for the hard chin beneath it and for the nervous but firmly set mouth . No one could tell what his complexion had been , he was now burnt so black . His eyebrows were bleached white and his lids slightly puckered . The whites of his eyes were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils seemed to veil themselves as if they had something to conceal . It was this quality of the eyes , always directed somewhere else even when looking at you , that lent Anthony a certain mystery which few who saw him failed to feel . In the final analysis it was hard to tell to whom you were talking . It even seemed as you came to know him better as though the gracefully directed precision of the young man before you was somehowcontrolled from otherwhere . All the negroes noticed it . Even the wide and pleasant forehead , P576 the now closely cropped but still wavy and sunny hair could not O Ur  --  come the impression . Ferdinando had once mentioned it jokingly . " The niggers say a wizard has stolen your soul , senor . " Anthony 's unexpected and electric outburst of fury had left the half . breed a paler and a wiser man . To Anthony it seemed that he was at last finding himself ; at lea he told himself that . Or perhaps he was creating a new self out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the life about hit He was " doing things " ; he was being a very practical and a success lid man in a situation that had required courage , finesse , adaptability , an grim determination to carry through . In three years he had not only collected the debt due to Mr. Bonnyfeather but he had also put hill 's self in the way of being a fairly rich man . What had happened t0 the firm of Gallego &; Son in the process he did not know and he ( lid not much care . That some payment as a sort of rental for the play on the Rio Pongo was made to the Gallego heirs he had finally elicited from Cibo after several inquiries . " Herr Meyier is taking care of that out of head-money , and the forced lease has been declared legal . advise you to drop the matter forthwith as it annoys His Excellency . You have nothing to fear . " That was all there was to that . He was master of what the blast from the Ariostatica had won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same way he had come in . Yet in growing into the kind of a mammal which Cibo had s0 strongly advised , there was a part of Anthony which seemed to be withering by the way . It was the part of him which lay locked up with the past in the fireproof storeroom he had built , where the chest which had come from Livorno reposed with Mr. Bonnyfeather 's books , the sextant , some smaller , more youthful clothes , and his old madonna . Not since he had arrived at Gallegos and buried fourteen of the crew of the Ariostatica in Brother Francois 's new graveyard , had he once opened it . Yet it was upon this part of him that his eyes looked when they turned inward . And it was the refusal to listen to certain old promptingsthat turned his pupils stony and had given him a fixed mask-like cast of countenance . It was all that which turned him white with fury when it had been suggested to him by his half-breed factor that what lay locked up in the fireproof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubts as to which was the better man of the two , the old self or the new Master of Gallegos . His will was now all on the side of the latter and it took less and less willing , he thought , to keep himself the Master of Gallegos from day to day . As that man he was devoid of visions . There was no doubt what was real and what was unreal to the newer man . The things of the body were now no longer merely on a ' par with dreams . They already mostly wco . P577and might soon come to be altogether the whole world in themselves . 1 t was difficult for him to have achieved this . Two things above all helped him to maintain it ; intercourse with Neleta and what he poured into himself from a glass . With only a little stimulant , so far , he could attain for the time being what seemed at least to be a solid basis of personality . Indeed , it was more than that , it was the sensation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soothed and allayed ; wine stimulated and completed . Neleta was beyond all this , Neleta was indescribable consummation of the flesh alone . He did not need to think about her . He consumed with her . Neleta was fire . On the evening upon which the captain of La Fortuna had been bidden to dine Anthony had finally decided to bring this fire to burn openly as it were upon his own hearth . The girl had so far lived , ostensiblyat least , with her brother Ferdinando in the factor 's house below . She was now to be the mistress of the new residence , and of its master , to run the domestic side of the establishment , and to provide what Anthony had found only she could provide . It was not the nice moral code of the Grain Coast which had hitherto prevented this arrangementfrom being consummated openly . It was only the hope on the part of Ferdinando that his sister might marry a ship 's captain and leave Africa , and a certain lingering reluctance in Anthony to take on any open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Neleta had become necessary and he was now about to admit it . He shook off the recollection of Angela 's " marriage breakfast " which occurred to him as they sat down to Neleta 's supper . It had taken several glasses of Constantia to effect that . " It is a wyn ' which the Dutch raise on the Cape , captain , better I think than Malaga . Certainly it is stronger , " he remarked as they sat down to supper . " I secured a whole legger of the Drakenstein of ninety-five for thirty pounds ! " and he filled the captain 's glass for the third time before the meal from a squat , marble-coloured magnum . Under the urge of the sunny spirit imprisoned there , which was now released around the whole table , the captain 's reservations vanished . The manner of the strange senor ingles became more cordial , he observed , as the meal advanced . His host , as it were , became more and more at home in his own house . " You see , Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rio Pongo . We are not such terrible people as rumour , I hear , sometimes paints us . " " I have already discerned that , " replied the captain . " Green turtles are not the only attraction on the Grain Coast . Other things also goP578 into making one 's soup palatable here , I observe . " He smiled , looking at Neleta at the table 's end , with more admiration than respect . " A great deal of sherry , " murmured Anthony . " It gives a certain dryness which I mightily like . " The captain somewhat hastily returned to the former subject . " I am really better prepared to find things as they are than y might suspect , senor . Our friend Carlo Cibo was quite glowing i his accounts of your establishment here . Under ordinary circunt stances I would not put La Fortuna into the slave trade . She is a very fine ship . . . " " So I am informed , " Anthony interrupted . " Carlo was equall glowing in his accounts of La @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , captain , at having a ship like La Fortuna , and a responsibl and understanding man like yourself , come out to Gallegos . When we began here we had to put up with what we could get . At that time about three years ago , the captain-general seized what ships he cool at Havana and sent them along . Some of the specimens of bot human and naval architecture which came to the Rio Pongo then would make your eyes hang out on your shirt . As soon as I could I protestedvigorously . Most of the losses in this business are through stupidity . Brutality and dirt ! There is no need for either . ' Sell me fast ships with intelligent officers and I will double your profits , ' I wrote home . Charter them if necessary . What is the use of throwingyour cargoes into the sea ? ' It was a long time , however , before they could understand my arithmetic . So I can honestly say , that it is. very gratifying to see a ship like La Fortuna riding at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a gentleman deserves . I trust you will find your errand thoroughly worth while . To your return , Captain Matanza . " Don Ruiz clicked glasses and with evident satisfaction . " To you , senor , and  --  to the lady , " he replied rising to the occasion . ' They all drank to Neleta , standing , Brother Francois and Ferdinando , too . Anthony was thankful to them and Neleta radiant . Across the table her sibilant monosyllables came bidding the captain welcome to Gallegos graciously enough . " Thou art a Catalan ! . . . senorita ? " he exclaimed . Anthony overlooked his familiar address . It would not do to press things too far  --  probably no harm was meant . " My father was from Barcelona , senor . " " Ah , then you know the Rambla there , perhaps ? " " Very well , indeed , I have played along it often . When I was five years old my father took me and my brother to live there . We liver ! for five years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are many blondes inP579Barcelona , but mostly the plump , sleepy kind , " he laughed . " Perhaps your mother was from Sevilla ? It is there the honey-coloured senoritas are found at their best . Pardon , but I admire them greatly . And you wear the shawl thrown over your arms , too . Ah , it is my admiration which has carried me away . Si , the women of Valencia are beautiful . But let us talk of Barcelona sometime again , senorita . With the senor 's permission , of course ! " He added that hastily , havingbecome aware of a sudden drop in the temperature . Ferdinando sat looking into his plate as if there were worms in it . Ile hated his negro blood . Neleta murmured some politeness in reply and turned to Brother Francois . " How were his orphans coming on today ? " . . . " As I was saying , captain , " continued Anthony , engaging that gentleman'ssomewhat reluctant attention again , " we shall look forward to your returning here often . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cargoes and taking care of them on the voyage home , you will find them in better health when you arrive than when you leave here . It will also keep your ship sweet and clean and I have persuaded Cibo to offer a higher bounty for a healthy shipment deliveredin prime shape . He can well afford to do that out of the higher price they will bring . Due to the invention of a cotton-picking machine I hear there is now a great demand in North America for sturdy field hands . " The captain now began to prick up his ears . " The hunters up-country have been instructed this time to bring clown as many Gora warriors as they can round up . I should tell you that we gather our cargoes here in three or four ways . I depend still for the most part on the caravans of slaves which the Mohammedans bring down from the interior about the end of the dry season . You get all kinds from them , good and bad . But you can never be sure . So this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under an Arab by the name of Ali Bongo , who is an excellent man . They are working now in virgin country north of the St. Pauls among the Gora forest people . They are a very fine race , totally unlike these ugly coast niggers , the Krus and Gubos , Putus , Sikons and whatnot . The Gora are lighter in colour , of pleasing , almost European features . The lips , of course ! They make excellent servants and respond to good treatment . I hope to make up your cargo for the most part from them. y friend Mongo Tom across the bay there works all the local coun-t ry about here and up and down the coast . By a special arrangement I take them off his hands . Between us we control all the trade on the river . There are also other ways of gathering slaves as you shall see before you go . You will probably have to lie here two or three weeks as the barracoons are practically empty now and you have arrivedP580 before the caravans . In that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ; ; deal of information about the best method of handling your people on the return voyage . It would be to our mutual advantage , certainly greatly to your own , if you will condescend to profit by our experience . A dirty ship and silly crowding , for instance , can cut profits in half . " " Your able factor has already been telling me things , senor , " saki the captain . " I can well believe there are tricks in this trade as in any other . " " Ferdinando is an excellent man , " said Anthony in a low tone . " back him to the limit . At the same time , captain , if you feel obliged to come to me about anything , please be at liberty to do so . You wi find me reasonable , and close-mouthed . I run the place and no one else . " " Thank you for that , senor . You know the chief difficulty a ship master has is with agents and subordinates from whom there is it appeal except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do not need to fear that here , Don Ruiz . " The captain raised his brows a little and smiled . " At least you ca count on me to follow out your suggestions and learn what I can , ' he continued . " I am genuinely anxious to do so . My great pricl senor , is my ship . La Fortuna , ah , she is beautiful ! " His face lit u as when he had been speaking of the women of Seville a few minutes before . " I would not have her filthy , have her smell , her beautiftl feathers all smeared , fah ! " He held his nose . " I have seen slay cr that way . But cargoes are hard to come by now with this cursed Ca on . I come here only because I must . Ah , pardon me , I forget , but do not criticize , senor . Not you ! We all make our living as we inns in this world , not as we should like . It is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on the man 's arm . He had found out rah the man honoured most . " A ship is not the worst God in the world , ' he thought , " especially when she is a goddess . " " Come , " said he . " You are from Toledo I am told  --  of the family Matanza ! Do you remember this ? It is luck that we have it  --  the lard ship in . . . " he drew the cork carefully and filled the captain 's glass . The captain sipped . " Peralta , senor , Dios de Dios ! You will be offering me trout fin ) the Tagus next . Ah , that tinge like a remembrance of muscat , the smell of it ! It is Toledo . " He closed his eyes . " I can see the Puerto del Sol ! Did you ever see the women of Toledo ? They wall ; in black satin slippers over the sharp , sharp little paving stones their , And their arches never touch them . Firm little bridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes looking a little foolish The wine was gone.  |p581Anthony  filled his glass again . " Gracia , gracia . " " A La Fortuna , si ? " said Anthony . " Ah , Madre de Dios , senor , " murmured the captain draining the second glass of Peralta . " Thou understandest ! " Anthony laughed and the captain hastened to explain . " It is a relief to find things so . " He spread out his hands in a gesture of glad acceptance . " Of Africa and the trade I have heard terrible things . True , your Cibo was persuasive , and La Fortuna was lying idle . But I would scarcely have risked her , no , I am sure I would not have come if I had not been asked by Cibo to see the last cargo you sent landed . Madre ! the ship , that little San Pablo was clean and the niggers all well and dancing . It made me laugh to see t hem . They were so glad to be in Cuba . You should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a blanket . They forgot all about their friends and country , dancing about like monkeys and putting on new clothes wrong side before . Imagine it ! When a cart came they were overwhelmed by the horses . They did not know beasts could be made to work . Then a black postilion in a silver laced hat , sky-blue coat , and white breeches came riding up . They could never get through feeling his polished jack-boots , and watching him leap on and off his prancing horse while his spurs rang . He cracked his whip and told them what a fine thing it was to be a slave of the white man . And they believed him . It was better than anything they had ever known . They all ran to snap fingers with their lucky brother . And the prices they brought next day at the sale ! Ah ! but in some ways that was not so good . The women will cry for their children . " He ended looking a little grave . " I have no doubt what you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen any of my cargoes landed in Havana but I know what kind of a life they leave here , captain , and there is no doubt that they go to a better place in Cuba . You see what most people forget is that these people are already slaves in Africa . They have been captured in war , or seized for debts , or condemned as criminals or for witchcraft . Any excuse is enough to make a man or woman a slave here . The powerful chiefs regard the weak or unfortunate as just so much walkingcapital and they draw their interest by putting them to work . It is the way that this part of the world not only does business but exists and it always has been that way . On the whole , the life they go to on any plantation run by Europeans in America is better than what they leave here . They are safer , more comfortable . Even their hardships are comparative luxuries . The English , I believe , are the worst masters . Jamaica , they say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slave than Africa . " P582 Anthony looked up to catch a smile on Ferdinando 's face . " Senor Adverse is eloquent sometimes , captain , " said the factor , " He should add that there would not be nearly so many slaves captured if it were not for the temptations the white man brings in the way of goods . " " Yes , " said Anthony a little reluctantly , " that is true . It is curious to think that after all it is the desire of the European merchants to sell cloth , firearms , rum , and various manufactured articles that makes men slavers here . That , and the necessity for cheap labour in America and the West Indies . That is what makes the New World go . " " Go where ? " interrupted Brother Francois who had been talking to Neleta . " Ah , father , I will not argue with you tonight , " laughed Anthony . " You are not a trader . The father is opposed to all this , " he explained . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can for those who are gathered in by the raiders . I will show you his good works tomorrow . They are , well  --  remarkable . I co-operate , yo know . That is all I can do . " He frowned a little . " Try some of this Arab stew , captain . It is curried lamb with rice balls seethed in milk . Do ! " He heaped Don Ruiz 's plate for him and refilled his glass . The captain and Ferdinando now devoted themselves to their plater and sundry items of commercial news . Brother Francois had fallen silent , Anthony observed . Neleta ate quietly . Only in her eating did she betray her native origin , everything was managed with a spoon and two fingers . With apparently no effort she simply made her food disappear as if by sleight of hand . Anthony sat looking at her at the other end of the table momentarily forgetful of everything but the coming night that they wool spend together . It had been a long time now ! Occasionally her eyes , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at him fro under her long black lashes . From time to time they lightened like a leopard 's half concealed in moonlight . The spidery-silk fringes of a Manila shawl drooped from her tawny arms and its embroidered magenta roses seemed to clamber over her breast and shoulders as i f a tropical vine had found a strong , lithe young tree to flaunt itself . upon in some open glade of the jungle . Under the shadow of her yellow bodice her breast rose and fell slowly with a deep visible mot ion that timed with a slight widening of her keen nostrils or a flash of her large white teeth . The colours that the girl wore would have overpowered most Europeanwomen ; they would have been bizarre . But there was something so vivid about Neleta , so brilliantly passionate and virile without a hint of nervousness , that the magenta roses in the gleaming whits shawl and the golden yellow of her dress were reduced by her to theP583equivalent of more sombre tones . What she put on , she made a part of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the folds of her shawl and the yellow silk of her dress her body shone with even more luminous curves and lines . Neleta was the crown of all this new life Anthony had carved outthe forest and seized for himself . She was the walking answer  --  and how she could walk ! to the objections expressed and understood which Brother Francois  --  that the mere presence of Brother Francois  --  constantlyposed . It was still a puzzle to Anthony how Brother Francois could still disapprove of him and yet be affectionate and kindly . Indeed , it was the affection in his disapproval that was hardest to stand . But he would . forget all that  --  tonight ! After he had gone over the ship 's mail and the invoices with Ferdinando  --  then  --  then he would give himself to Neleta . It was like that . He would give himself to her . She would be waiting . He leaned his head on his hand looking at her with the strong , calm glow of wine thoroughly upon him . In the light of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floated throwing a metlowglow through the calabash rinds , the room swam with a soft suffused pallor while Cheecha and her assistant girls came and went silently on bare feet like ministering shadows . One side of the place was screened from the court by long strips of white muslin sewn together and on this he could see the shadows of palm fronds moving in the moonlight . The spring gurgled in its stone basin beyond . The red-striped native pottery stood out above the table-cloth in startling patterns , and the faces and voices of his guests seemed hazy and distantas he lost himself inwardly in a dream of ' contented approval , Wordless , and imageless except for what lay vaguely before him . It was a feeling of satisfaction and equilibrium that he would allow no thoughts to mar . I t was Neleta who finally motioned to him . The others had finished . She and Brother Francois left . Ferdinando dumped the mail pouch on the table . With a bundle of black cigars before them they spread tit various papers and got down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of newspapers in various languages which Cibo assiduously collected for him from ships ' captains at I lavana . They would serve to while away many a tedious afternoon during the rainy season , although some of them were nearly a year old . The business of being a slaver , Don Ruiz could see , was an intricateone . Indeed , Anthony 's long hours spent with accounts , correspondence , and invoices at the Casa da Bonnyfeather now stood him in good stead . Most of the slavers on the Coast , he discovered , had failed largely because they kept no books . They were always in debtp584 when they closed out , or they got careless and turned over the ware  --  houses to clerks who robbed them . Gallego had left his keys to the old woman in charge of his harem . Ferdinando had been helpless under her pilfering . Anthony had shipped her off to Cuba as he did not wish to be poisoned . She had gone aboard ship foaming . The rest of the seraglio had departed with her .

" Home , come home ! " Would they never cease ? Where is home Italy and the Casa da Bonny feather ? All Europe was like the ( ' al da Bonnyfeather , he thought , a building with frescoes of old , love dreamful things fading and flaking off its walls , where forgotten g ( feasted on oblivion overhead , and little men crawled underneath kccp ing accounts and writing letters about things ; where Toussaints ' forever at desks and dreamed hopelessly of love , and mumbled of frcy dom and of golden savages , and ate their hearts out and were a f rak of themselves .

It had been real once . In the villages of Italy on those morning ) drives with Angela he had caught glimpses of it , a world that remained in fragments ; that let itself be seen by segments out of the corner of I wise young eye . It was the world he had found once with Angels once , too late , a lost world . He could not " go back " to it . He wouldP589have to find it , or make it here . Here in the forest where the germens of it remained . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but light , and resting his chin on his hands . It seemed to him that he understood at last what the bronze boy by the fountain had gone blind looking for in the ceaseless , monotonous changefulness of the water that flowed past him like time . It was what he himself was going blind looking for in the waters of change that flowed past him forever and forever , the mysterious fluid if events that looked so clear as it dashed for a moment into the sunshine , streaming from some mysterious source and flowing ever in one direction on into the unknown . Yes , it was like that . He himself might be the other bronze boy , the missing twin who had disappeared from his brother 's side by the fountain ages ago . Perhapshe was ? Perhaps , he had only come back again to watch the water for a while . Perhaps , that bright vision of the beautiful playmate , the boy whose face was in the fountain , the child who had lain amid the branches and talked with him was real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all . Who knows who I am ? What knows ? And who cares ! . . . The lovely madonna that had visited him that night with Angela , she might have cared , would have . . . but no more . In his being he knew he would never find her again . With Neleta all was dark as he lay  --  nothing there but his frame . But that remained ! That remained ! He would enjoy all he had left ; prove to himself he was still alive . . . feel . Wine ! He poured himself another glass . The candles had long burned out now , even the palm-oil lamp was waning . He rose and swept aside the letters  --  from the world of cobwebs . Mariana ! What did they matter ? He blew out the light . The distant howling-boom from the forests seemed to fill the chamber . It was always stronger on moonlight nights . He breathed heavily in the darkness , listening . The little owls in the orchard below kept hobbling . Somewhere a mouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose and fell , now in high chorus and now in shattered undertones , the voice of the fathomless jungles that surroundedGallegos ; the roaring of crocodiles in the valley below , the far-off trumpeting of herds of elephants , the howling of monkeys hurling themselves along their treetop avenues through the moonlight , going nowhere . At Bangalang someone was comforting himself with a tom-tom . The throb of it rather than the sound came , a dim pulsationin the wind . The stridulous cry of quadrillions of insects madeP590 the night quiver . He stood and trembled with it . Like a dancer lending himself to irresistible music he gave himself to what seemed to a tune remembered by his bones and muscles rather than his ! Ili The frame of him ' swayed to it . The warm air from the patio had him luxuriously and wandered under his loose clothes . He let them fall to the floor listlessly and enjoyed the stimulating , soft freshn of it caressing him from head to foot where he stood . The rank , u flowers of hundreds of papayas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if lemon blossoms were being crushed by his fHe kicked the clothes under the table , and enjoyed the silent tread of his bare feet while gliding down the corridor to his room at end of it . There was not a sound in the house now . Cheecha her girls slept in the wing on the other side of the court . The door locked itself and closed by a weight . Surprises in this coon might be final and fatal . He had tried to eliminate surprises 1 ) y sects , animals , and men . Only the terrible or ingenious succeeded finding privacy in Africa . There was a certain fascination in having attained it against the entire scheme of things ; in maintaining a cessful defence against a perpetual siege . When he entered the ror completely at ease about his understood isolation with the woman w shared it with him , Neleta was asleep . She lay on a light couch which she had pulled out from a corner placed for coolness close to the rush screen that formed the wall of apartment where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering part of the floor with a carpet of small par leis of light and shade and the walls with a dim pallor . She lay breast down , coverless , with her head resting lightly on one arm flung car before her as if she had been swimming in the river of night and h paused in her stroke to dream awhile and float down its tide . 1 ' curious effect of parallel black stripes and silver fell obliquely across her honey-coloured hips . Although he was already tense with the certainty and anticipation of finding her awaiting him , this peculiar pattern of light and shadowl with its background assumed for Anthony  --  as soon as it arrange itself before his eyes where he stood naked in the dim centre of Ih room  --  that supreme importance which the state of fire always he everywhere in the universe . All that he was , all the world about hin seemed to be drawn on a hurrying wind into the living symbol bcfon him and to be sublimed there . The meaning of that symbol was to be understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind of Anthony had little or nothin ) to do . For him the gears of existence were shifted automatically l the signal of Neleta 's naked hips from the secondary and ration order of existence into the primary and material . To it his own pair+p591the alphabet of the eternal word answered convincingly . Matter as about to get the necessary business of its preservation in a certain form accomplished , and the means to this end now violently emanated heat as a preliminary to the process . Anthony was aware of all this . I le did not think of it in so many sentences as he stood for a minute looking upon Neleta asleep in the barred moonlight ; he apprehended it all as though it were expressible in one deep-breathed word , the exquisitehieroglyphic of which was the form of the woman before him with all her secrets bare . The meaning of it was action , the supreme action upon which all other acts depend . Perhaps the only thought he had as he moved through the moony twilight to consummation was a realization that only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter of the word be made complete . But this realization could scarcely be termed a thought , for the primal knowledge of it was accompanied by so intensea glow of pleasure that it was completely resolved in feeling alone . He shifted her head slightly and she awoke looking up at him half dreamfully , contentedly settling herself in her nest face down . He put his arms about her , locking his hands on her breasts and letting his weight come upon her . She sighed fondly , and locked her legs about his own . The union of Anthony and Neleta was physically a complete one . It was that of a mature man and woman who were together often ; who knew what was to be expected of each other , and how to act . Neither had any doubt of self and each was wholly absorbed for the time being in the other . In this way they were able for considerable intervalsof time to escape completely from themselves and to become another which was both of them . Theirs was not that ghastly wraith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by friction to die feebly with nervous gasps and hatred , nor was it the spasmodic wrigglingof curious younglings interested in experimenting with themselves . They were not furtively surprised at last by a really intense , final throb of pleasure . Nor was one completed suddenly and the other left desperate . Once having given themselves to each other , everything else was taken care of for them by forces over which they had , and desired to have , no control . Indeed , the supreme contentment of it all was that once locked together all that followed was involuntary . They participated in and became one in another impersonal self . The reward of obedience to the will of that self beyond them was a long continued and increasing ecstasy that just upon the verge of becoming unbearable blessedly relieved itself and left them to rest in each other 's arms . In the morning they would wake to see that the sun was making ap592 golden pattern through the screen where that of the moon had been silver the night before . They would hear Cheecha and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rippling quality o sunlight in the tones of their talk and laughter that only the morning voices of Africans can convey . They would get up quietly without saying much , and giving each other a kiss of peace and happiness would put on some light clothes and go out to breakfast in t ) courtyard . After that the housegate was unbarred , the bridge of steps let down over the little " ant-moat " before the veranda , and the work of the d began . Neleta busied herself with the house and its keeping , in all t generously supplied details of which she took an immense and efficient pleasure . Anthony found himself pleasantly overwhelmed by a thousand details that in the voluble persons of blacks , whites , and yell() clambered for immediate attention and decisions of considerab moment to many souls . He used the cool morning hours diligently . On the morning after the supper with Captain Matanza of La both tuna the " barkers " came in from the hill country , saying they had pc suaded a large Arab caravan to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparation for its advent . To give certain directi to the guides , and to honour the approaching Arab mongo , or chief captain , one of the cannons began to fire at regular intervals . P593A G L I M P S E I N T O T H E F U R N A C E IT IS quite unusual for a caravan to be coming to us at this time of year , " Anthony remarked to the captain as they sat smoking together on the dock , watching La Fortuna 's cargo being whipped out of her hatches under the active superintendence of Juan . The squall of the winches and the shouts of the crew working block-andtacklecame over the water . Several large boats and rafts plied back and forth . The morning was sticky-hot and the river valley breathless . In the brown water the velvet shadows of the barracoons waveredsullenly as the boats passed . Anthony removed his wide palm hat from time to time to mop his face . " Like bronze beginning to sweat in the fire , " thought Don Ruiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first drops begin to run . A iter a while the metal collapses  --  suddenly . " He was feeling like a rag himself this morning ; inclined to be weakly reminiscent . He found it hard to be interested in anything , " Oh , " said he , " I thought caravans just kept coming . " He looked faint . Anthony laughed and passed him a flask . . . They both felt brighter now . . . " No , usually they get here in November when the dry season begins . La Fortuna is the magnet now . You see some time ago I sent barkers with special inducements to one of the chief Foulah mongos back in the hill-country , the Ali Mami of Futa-Jaloon . He is an Arab ruler who lords it over a great reach of territory stretching , I do not know how far , north-and-east up toward Timbo . The boys who returned this morning tell me the old scoundrel has been raiding far-and-wide and has sent down his nephew , one Amah-de-bellah , in charge of a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very intelligent and pleasant young Mussultman ; black , but a gentleman according to his lights . I have had some amicable and profitable dealings with him before . Indeed , he is anxious to convert me to his own faith and has even invited me to visit his uncle 's capital . I may do it yet . " But come , they will not be here for several hours yet  --  have another pull at this  --  helps , eh ? . . . Well , we might as well see what is going on and get you familiar with Gallegos . I make it a habit to go over the place every morning . " He shoved his hat back on his head . Theyp594 rose , and chatting together , strolled down the clock into the big w house . " We rebuilt this after a fire when I first came , " Anthony explain " The smaller buildings up the slope are for storage , too . It is a idea not to have all of one 's cocoanuts on one tree , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however . " In the grateful shadow of the place the captain now looked a him with considerable interest . The building was a long barn-like structure with lofts . The evil was provided with trap doors . These were now hanging open , various bulky packages of trade-goods were being lowered in prel tion for the approaching caravan . A bolt of striped cloth slide escaped from someone 's hands in the loft above and streamed d out of the darkness like a flapping serpent . Cries and shrieks raucous laughter arose . Half the Kru boys on the floor stop ' trundling bales to help rewind the cloth . They got tangled iii it . tool : Ferdinando with a cane to restore order . Nevertheless , the shed continued to hum with excitement , loud t songs , whistling , and a rhythmic stamping as the luxuriant cargo La Fortuna rolled in from the dock and was hoisted into the lofts trundled to the opposite end of the building . There was an air triumph about it ; the sheer joy of the Ethiopian at being surrounds d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whooped . trolley on a travelling pulley ran from one end of the shed to the others and was whisking back and forth , dangling a net full of bales a clinging black boys who screamed with delight at the spinal thrill of aerial ride . Like large liver-coloured flies their bodies seemed stru gling in a vast spider web as they passed through the grotesque shadows of the beams and windows that barred the place with transverse shadows and shafts of light . The air danced with dust in thousand sun pencils , and the captain now saw rather than heard t sound that permeated the whole atmosphere , for the very motes in the air were leaping to the low but swift and nervous lilt of drums . ( ; a and humorous greetings met the two as they continued along the war house floor , the captain 's brass buttons , fat legs and skin-tit ; trousers causing many an eye to roll back till it showed as white the grin beneath it . " Merry enough ! " said Don Ruiz who was now feeling the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only way to get things done in a hurry here , " replied Anthony , " songs , and excitement . If you get the right beat going you can move mountains . " He pointed to two youngsters at the door working away delightedly at small hand-drums . A blue-black Mandingobuck shuffled by doing a slide-and-slap under a mountainous bale.  |p595Don  Ruiz burst into a laugh . In the fellowship of humour the man roared back like a gorilla . " These stevedores and boatmen are all Mohammedans hired from war-by coastal villages ; mostly Krus , " continued Anthony . " It pays . ' I heir wages are less than what slaves would manage to steal . " They stopped for a moment at the extreme end of the shed in a railed-off space . Here under the eyes of Ferdinando chests were being opened ; bale covers were being ripped off and the contents spread out for display or heaped in convenient piles while two armed Foulahs watched every move . " Samples , here , " said Anthony . " The chief traders , and petty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ca n't linger too long now . Come this way . " They stepped out of the factor 's office , already brilliant with striped cloths , brass jewelry , and rolls of copper wire , into a long porch covered by half-transparent tarpaulins slushed with beeswax . The place basked in a kind of amber glow . There was a wide , beaten-clay floor tinder the awning , several stone blocks with rings in them , an X-shaped whipping post . A low bench provided with mats for squatting extendedthe whole length of the place . " The slaves are stood tip and examined here before the goods are paid over . I watch that myself . " " Do you use the post much ? " asked Don Ruiz . " Not often , but now and again , " said Anthony . " The captured witch-doctors sometimes need a little nine-tailed magic to convince them . I leave that to Ferdinando . He knows . " He passed the black post rather hurriedly . The tarpaulin-covered porch led directly into the first of the barracoons that lined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were long sheds built of heavy , hardwood timbers flat on two sides and driven into the ground so closely together that not even a knife-blade could be inserted between them . A wide opening in the roof for air and sunlight extended down the centre . The space for each slave was narked off with whitewashed lines on the stone so that the floor in its semi-gloom looked like a board upon which some giant game might be played with pieces six feet by four . Each space was provided with shackles to keep a pawn from moving itself , however , and there was a wooden pillow , a stool , and two earthen pots in every " square . " A more lavishly furnished corner screened by mats with small , round windows in them marked where the two overseers kept watch . Four of these barracoons , each with its number given in red strokes on the door , lay separated by about a twenty-yard interval . But they were so disposed that each formed one side of a square . The intervalsP596 between were heavily barricaded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave pens . " Tor the most part we shackle the slaves only at night , " said A thong . " In the day they exercise in these yards if the weather permit That keeps the barracoons from getting musty . ' We feed them well , make them bathe often , and get them fattened up for the voyage . " Why , you could house a regiment here ! " exclaimed Don Ruiz . " Yes ? Well , as a matter of fact , in the last three or four ye several regiments have passed through them . Did it ever strike y captain , that a large part of the New World will inevitably be rather African ? Hundreds of shiploads of these black people have he going west now for hundreds of years . And Africa is now hei poured out into America and the islands faster than ever before Yet they are still calling for more from Boston to Buenos Aires . The war between England and Spain has only put up the price . " " Niggers do n't count in America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Each counts one , and they might possibly have children , " nuts Anthony . " What the devil ( do we care ! " grunted Don Ruiz . " Is n't it prof ' ) able ? You yourself seem to be making a pretty good thing out o them . What are you worrying about ? And yet , pardon me , hut I did seem strange to me , senor  --  last night I thought of it  --  that a mall like you should be slaving . No offence , of course , " he hastened t add . " It was merely a passing thought . " " It is strange , " replied Anthony laconically , looking about him fo a moment as if he found himself in a curiously unexpected place . The captain grinned . " My mother intended me for the priesthood , he said . " Perhaps mine did , too . Quien sabe ? But after all it is what w. do that makes us what we are , is n't it ? " queried Anthony hal f to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His eyes also for a moment had become bleak . Suddenly they both recognized each other 's look and laughed . " Exiled , eh , " thought Don Ruiz . " Regretful , " thought Anthony . " Try one of these , amigo mio , " said the captain producing his cigar case . " These long , black fellows from Havana make one forget . The real leaf ! I smoke ten a day . By evening the ground under one 's feet becomes velvety . It seems to give a little when you step out . Even the prodding fingers of destiny are made blunt by tobacco . It was discovered just in time . Think what we should be without it 1 This age is like a busy mother-in-law to a man of feeling . We can no longer marry the world and be happy with it . Madre ! " He struckp 597fire like a craftsman , and they ascended the hill together in a cloud of blue smoke . The little gun near the residence was still faithfully banging away at intervals . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yellow powder-smoke drifted slowly in long ribbons through the plantations . After each explosion the parrots settled back into the trees again . Anthony paused suddenly beside a small foot-path leadingdown from the road into a wooded hollow . " Turn aside here with me for a moment and I 'll show you what you have forgotten , " he said . " It is more interesting than the barracoons , I think . " They threaded a small thicket of date palms and fig trees , and soon disappeared from the road amid the dense shade of an ever-more luxuriantlittle oasis as the ground grew lower and damper . Already it was getting cool . Suddenly they came out into an open , palm-lined , grassy place about an acre in extent . A small stream rushed down it babbling fondly . The water gushed out from under a low cliff ; raced for a few hundred yards as though frightened by the sunlight , and then disappeared into the hill again with a surprised gurgle through a rock that parted its sandy lips to drink it in . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a manless world . Refreshed , they rose and looked about them . Before them half a dozen beehive huts were scattered about the oval , green levels in a rough semi-circle , like straw dwellings of enormous honey-gatherers . At the upper end of the glade was a Lilliputian chapel built into the rocky outcrop from which the stream itself sprang . There was a rude wooden cross before it , large , out of all proportion . There was even a miniature belfry in which hung an old ship 's bell upon which the sun struck with a single brassy glint in the surroundingocean of green . Seated on a stool at the foot of his rood was Brother Francois in his now much-faded gown , sandals , and a large planter 's hat . There were nearly a score of young darkies about him . They were repeating in unison something he was teaching them and the high murmur of their voices came to the two unobserved onlookers , where they stood in the shadow of the palms at the edge of the clearing , faintly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universal accent of happy childhood . It instantly reminded Anthony of the fresh gales of young voices which had sometimes come through the school windowsat the convent while the pigeons and fountain talked togetherp598 in the court below . It was a sound like the leaves in that lost alley of the Moselle stirred long ago by a cool morning breeze . He remembered it . For a while both he and the captain forgot their cigars which accumulated a long ash while they stood watching and listening . DonRuiz felt he might wake up at any moment as a boy again in his room at Toledo with the vocative Tagus gossiping a hundred feet below . Both men , in fact , found something peculiarly affecting in the little scene before them . Yet the sheer reality of it , drenched as it was in the stark , equator sunshine , the vividness of the black children dressed in white cast-0 rice bags lying about their master like so many animated handkerchief on the glassy green of the grass conveyed its own meaning in a deep and natural tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even the suggestion of a sentimental tremolo . On account of the noisy stream neither Anthony nor Don Ruiz could hear what Brother Francois was saying nor the children 's replies . But from time to time the man 's face shone out from under his hat . when he looked up to speak , and the effect of his words could he seen by the ripples and wriggles of his small congregation . What he had to say was evidently something they were glad to hear . But more than that  --  it was because he was saying it that they listened . No one  --  Anthony felt sure  --  no one who had not seen the tender ness , that strong and vivid look of affection upon Brother Francois ' $ face , could have imagined its gentle strength . When he looked up and spoke , his features succeeded in their own particular way in giving a personal and living meaning to the general abstraction called " mercy . " " Do not disturb him , senor , " muttered the captain in a changed voice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned as if to go and then stopped to look back again . They both stood watching farther withdrawnnow under the airy groins of some date palms , like cathedral sightseers , who , blundering upon a service in a side-chapel , had shrunk back at the thought of disturbing prayers . It did not seem to Anthony now that Brother Francois appeared impotent against the world which surrounded him . What the matt was doing there , what he was , looked permanent . Because his work was so invincibly humble as to escape notice , it seemed likely that it might prevail . It had , he thought , the delicate strength of flowers that perish easily and are constantly being trampled upon , but which siteceednevertheless in transmitting their unchanging pattern of beauty through aeons of seasons . Suddenly he thought of Father Xavier , tooAnd was instantly reminded of a fossil water-lily that he had once seen in a cabinet somewhere ; the cabinet was dark . Oh , yes  --  he hadp599seen it at Maddalena Strozzi 's . But he always thought of Brother Francois and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about light that day on the Wampanoag while Mrs. Jorham had been showing him her sewing ? What was it , now ? Oh ! . . . said let there be light and there was . . . The Word . . . or something . Well , well  --  at least the captain too was touched by this scene today , and he was no softy , God knows . . . stole cannon , Cibo said . . . Now in these dense forests all about Gallegos trees fell but the light beat down and the forest went on . The light healed wounds and scars and nourished seedlings to fill up the places of trees that fell in the forest . . . that fell there and rotted . And all the seedlings struggled up toward the light . Those that could n't get out of the shade died . But strange things lived in that perpetual shade ; their forms were nightmares , horrible . . . no light ! " How is it , Anthony , you have been so long a lurker in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ? Brother Francois has hidden these children from you . " Yes , he always begs for the very young and sickly  --  " And now look ! Why are you crouching here in the shadows . . . afraid of the light ? " " 0 Mother of . . . ! " Stop ! You must remember you can not say it . Carlo said . . and I know . " The boom of the little gun on the hill above shattered his reverie : Hid tie captain 's simultaneously . They turned without saying anything further and took a short-cut up the hill . Their path now led them directly to the foot of the low cliff that hid the small valley from both the road and the residence . Indeed , from the house veranda the valley might not have existed . It might have been merely a dip in the hill over which the eye shot directly to the barracoons below . But just from the top of the rocky outcrop , which otherwise hid it so well , all of it was visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep . They stood breathing a moment after the climb and looked down . They saw the small chapel again and a graveyard with white crosses hidden in the trees , which they had not seen before . There was a surprisingnumber of crosses  --  considering . Women were moving about the beehive huts with children hanging on their breasts . From rowsf banana trees purple blossoms and ripe clusters also depended heavily . It was all intensely green , silent , fruitful . The place seemed to have dropped out of the world into a hollow . For an instant the spell of it clutched at them again . There were no shadows there . High noon . . . Just then the little bell rang out softly and clearly . They watched it turn on its wheel . Its clear notes fell out of thep600 silence like quicksilver dropping out of darkness into sheer light . The captain crossed himself automatically . Anthony stopped his own luau ) just in time . He saw all the children and people below there kneel clown . From the chapel came a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying  --  those words " God have mercy upon us . . . " he thought . . . Suddenly from the hill above came a great shout and the crackle of musketry . A nasal singing and the mad beating of tom-toms could now he heard emerging from the forest beyond the stockade and getting louder . The little gun began to answer as rapidly as it could . " Well , captain , your slave caravan has arrived , " Anthony said . " Mine ? " laughed Don Ruiz looking a little startled . " You are too generous , senor ! " They went up again without looking behind them . Anthony thought once that he could still hear the bell . Yet it nnurt have stopped . And hell was to pay about the stockade gate . What a waste of powder ! At the residence all was now in final frantic activity , although Neleta had been actively preparing for the advent of the caravan since early dawn . A portion of the veranda had been screened off with matte and a huge cocoanut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captain of La Fortuna , a prayer rug and a sheepskin for the approaching mongo of the caravan completed the arrangements , except for a half dozen Foulahs armed with flintlocks and cutlasses who nodisposed themselves as a guard of honour . Behind the door Nelete ' stood ready to receive her guests , with Cheecha and the other women slaves . As the honourable mistress of the house , she wore a long embroidered veil over her face and shoulders . Anthony and the captain had scarcely had time to snatch a cooling drink and seat themselves on the veranda before the battery on the slope below began to fire smoky salvos and the caravan was seen filing through the stockade gate on the hill above . As the nephew o the Ali Mami of Futa-Jaloon , Amah-de-bellah was to be received as is prince of the blood . At the same time the ample defences of Gallegos were also made sufficiently plain . The procession which now began to unroll itself through the gale and to advance down the slope toward the residence seemed to the unaccustomed eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange were the aspects of the men and beasts who walked and stalkedp601in it that it might have been an embassy from another planet , he thought . A crowd of painted Mandingo barkers preceded it . They were dressed only in breech-clouts , but armed with the deadliest weapons of noise ; enormous oboes that shrieked and grunted like pigs in the flames , cymbals , tom-toms , jar-drums , bull whistles , and gourd rattles on long sticks . These , and fifty other hellish devices , produced an atmospheric disturbance that , added to the salvos from the cannon , raised the wild-fowl from the marshes for miles around . And out of this immense volume of sibilant , wheezy , roaring , and brassy noises combined throbbed a continuous syncopated undertone of drumming and rattling to which the mob of naked heralds advanced shuffling and stamping ; meanwhile howling out like a pack of lyrical hyenas the surpassing power and generosity of their approaching chief . Those who could no longer howl , droned . Amah-de-bellah himself now appeared mounted on a fly-bitten but stalwart grey barb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks past on nothing but tropical moss . The chief was followed by a fat , black dervish on a vicious mule . The holy man held a whip in one hand and a huge Koran wrapped in a prayer rug in the other . Three of Amah-de-bellah 's wives in long white veils in which there were only eye-holes appeared next like ghosts riding upon diminutive donkies . These little asses , which continually brayed and sobbed , were driven forward by thorn whips in the hands of the harem attendants who took turns at beating them , although themselves loaded down with great-pots , mats , vast umbrellas , bundles of apparel , and hut furniture . Commerce having thus at once advertised itself with its usual modesty and exhibited its veiled cause , its inevitable and necessary armed escort followed . In this case it consisted of a guard of some fifty or more fanatical Foulahs dressed in the white robes of peace and their own skinny , black legs . They rushed through the gate in a body , firing matchlocks , whirling , shrieking , capering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair of this jungle militia was in each case frizzed-up into a kind of cock 's comb dyed purple-red by a delicate solution of iron , urine , and lime . As they streamed after their leader in a mimic melee they managed to confer on the word " ferocious " a new and more sinister meaning . All of them , however , and the people who had just preceded them , were now brought together half-way down the slope , where Amah-debellahhad halted to await the rest of his caravan before advancing in state to the veranda . An interval of unexpected and consequently dramatic silence ensued . In the midst of this , without any prelude whatever , a long , dark ,  |p602  glistening body commenced to crawl through the gateway as though a legendary serpent were sliding into the stockade . It really seemed at some distance to be one body . As it came nearer , however , it wits seen to be composed of hundreds of naked , human bodies rubbed shiny for their approaching sale with palm oil and rancid butter . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched from . , tight neck-fork to another bound them together into one interminable , twisting line . Soon the small forms of children could be made out darkening the intervals between the passing legs of this huge millepede as it wound down the slope . Hovering about it , and along its flanks , ; were white-robed Arabs with rhinoceros-hide whips . An occasionreport like a pistol-shot from one of these instruments helped to keep the worm crawling fairly rapidly . Although the best of all his merchandise had thus arrived on its own legs , Amah-de-bellah did not at once advance to the veranda . He delayed for nearly half an hour while various minor chiefs and forest traders , each accompanied by his own slaves , native wares , and pandemonium , came through the gate . The bulk of the caravan , indeed , consisted of these people . In the meantime Anthony and Captain Matanza sat solemnly an quietly smoking cigars . " It would , of course , " remarked Anthony , lighting another , " be far beneath the dignity of such potentates as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing as a caravan of a thousand souls has arrived in our back yard . It is like having a policy toward an earthquake . It is not even to be thought about till it announces itself . " " The best people at home treat a revolution in the same way , " said Don Ruiz . " Until it sets fire to their houses , or cuts off their heads , it does not exist . " " Precisely . In the same way we should lose caste if we seemed to notice that Amah 's people are here . As yet he is only about to arrive , ' Nevertheless , there is no objection to my men distributing the gifts of welcome in advance  --  as I see you have noticed . These gifts ' are care  --  fully calculated . They are really part of the trading and will later on be returned in kind . I leave this part of the preliminaries to some of my own Arabs , who estimate carefully what each one of these small traders has to offer and welcome him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this earnest of his desire to trade . Amah and I have not exchanged gifts yet . We will do that at the big dantica , or trade-talk , that will shortly take place here . But here they come ! " A renewed outburst of mind-sickening noise now shattered the silence . Aided by men with bull-whips , Amah could be seen riding along the flank of his motley host licking it into what might pass in Africa for a semblance of order . A large cock-ostrich at the rear ofp603the column gave the most trouble and dodged about with such gargantuaneffeminacy and nervousness in his mincing strides that Anthony and the captain were hard put to it to remain solemn . At last having settled all to his liking , including the ostrich , Amah rode to the head of the procession and tossed his cloak in the air . At this signal the whole howling host precipitated itself toward the residence like a dark flood . The space before the veranda on the far-side of the little moat was soon dense with a hustling , black mob . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to press forward . Fights and jabbering ensued . But for a few minutes nothing could be heard on the porch except the thunderous chanting of Amah-de-bellah 's barkers answered by Anthony 's men ; each side trying to outpraise their respec-t ive masters till wind was exhausted . Presently the armed Foulahs in the centre faced outward , and by beating on the bare ground with their musket butts succeeded finally in clearing a semi-circle at the expense of numerous sore toes . Silence , except for the braying of donkeys and the squalls of babies , was at length restored . Amah and his dervish now advanced into the centre of the cleared space , where a prayer rug was spread by the latter . On this the chief knelt facing Mecca and returned thanks for the safe arrival of his caravan . As he rose hundreds of voices insisted in bastard Arabic that there was my one God and Mohammed was his prophet . The captain was now more than ever amazed by a scene which had become somewhat familiar to Anthony . Behind the thin line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . monstrous by lip disks and rings in their noses and ears ; rose a mountainouslandscape , tier upon tier of grass-wrapped elephant tusks , roped boxes , bundles , and mat-covered bales . A shimmer of copper bracelets , torques , and arm bands together with spearheads and polishedmuskets caught the sun and tossed it from point to point . Long , cigar-shaped bundles of damp banana leaves smoked wispily upon the heads of the fire-bearers . On the hillside beyond , rows of yoked and shackled captives looked on apathetically . A fetid smell like that of a neglected monkey cage mixed with the pungent odour of burning leaves caused Don Ruiz to cough and puff hastily at his cigar . Weavingback and forth over the fuzzy heads of the multitude , the chinless face of the ostrich peered insanely , blinking with pink and inflamed lids . Prayers finished , Amah-de-bellah took the Koran from its bearer and held it to his forehead in token that all he was about to say was true . Gifts were now exchanged between him and Anthony . . The Mohammedan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small goat 's horn filled with gold dust . He was amusedP604to note , as he hefted it , that what it contained was worth almost exactly what the saddle had cost . The preliminaries having been settled Anthony came forward , and bidding Amah welcome with much ceremony , conducted him to hit sheepskin on the veranda . Here the captain was introduced and cordially met , for with a happy impulse he took his watch out of his vent pocket and presented it to the . A heavy , gold bracelet front the chief 's arm left both parties extremely satisfied . Neleta now air pmongoeared with a small silver dish and from this before the whole assembly the three men on the veranda ate dried rice cakes dipped in salt . One of Anthony 's Foulahs now advanced to the edge of the porch and announced that the powerful Master of Gallegos and the mighty Mongo having eaten salt together  --  as all might see  --  Gallegos bade the servants of the Mongo welcome . Five bullocks and innumerable sheep had been slaughtered and were roasting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be had . By the blessing of Allah , trade would begin this afternoon  --  at the firing of a gun . In the meantime let all depart , find quarters , and refresh themselves at the superb feast provided by the matchless generosity of the Master of Gallegos . The usual tribute to monotheism and its prophet proclaimed that the dantica was over . The crowd broke and raced down the slope , every petty trader trying to outdistance the others to a choice camping place . These had been so arranged as to lie under the muzzles of the cannon on the hill and the guns of the ship . The armed Arabs , the bearers , and slaves followedat a more leisurely pace , leaving the three on the veranda alone . Neleta had already conducted the wives of Amah to a hut in the courtyard , nicely furnished , and erected that morning out of new mats , Neither Anthony nor the captain looked at the three veiled apparitions which passed them . Presumably they did not exist . It was amusing to Don Ruiz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anthony and Amah conducted themselves . They fell into a long and friendly talk assisted by one of the Foulahs who acted interpreter . Anthony 's " Arabic " was by no means satisfactory yet . The trade jargon of the Grain Coast , indeed , was a compound of Arabic , Portuguese , Spanish , and Mandingo in which the first pre dominated . Fingers , knuckles , and toes supplied arithmetic . This was the third caravan which Amah had led to Gallegos . Anthonyand he had entered into what amounted to a partnership based on a general admiration for each other 's resourcefulness and the mutual advantages of co-operation . Amah watched the inland trails constantly and swept into his net all the small traders going to the coast , in the meanwhile carrying on a holy war against the heathen upon his uncle 's borders . In this way he was able to gather togetherp605large caravans of both slaves and traders , offering to the latter his " protection , " and incidentally watching that they did not skip off to trade at the establishments on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " protection " he levied a tax . But unlike other leaders of caravans he collected the tax and no more . On the whole everybody was satisfied . Amah was very anxious to have Anthony come inland with trade goods to Futa-Jaloon in order to supply his uncle with arms , ammunition , and European merchandise directly . He had promised Anthony protection and an ample supply of slaves at home-prices , and he had been pressing in his invitation on his last visit a year before . On the present occasion he now renewed this request with the information that his uncle had promised to proclaim an annual market at his capital and not to invite any other European traders for a period of three years . After an hour 's talk , in which all the details for the journey were settled and an ample escort promised to Anthony whenever he should ask for it , Anthony in turn promised Amah to visit him at Futa-Jaloon when the next dry season should set in . Greatly pleased at having obtained consent to his cherished project and at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retired to his mat hut in the courtyard . The separate shelter prevented him from living under the same roof with slaves and Christian dogs . Here he partook of his own rations and solaced himself in retirement with his wives . The little court was full of his furniture , animals , and servants , and Neleta was consternatedfor her flowers . At half past two the boom of the gun announced that trade had I Begun . Anthony , Don Ruiz , and Amah-de-bellah betook themselves to the water front below . The swiftness and orderliness of trade had been considerably acceleratedat Gallegos by reaching an agreement beforehand with the leadersof caravans as to the prices to be paid for various kinds of goods . his did away with endless chaffering and making dantica with swarms of small traders over every ox hide and piece of ivory . Slaves were another matter . As a caravan must be entertained at the expense of the establishment until trade was over , time was dollars .
