Last week Felix , consort of Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg hurriedly ended a goodwill visit to the U. S. , sailed home to his wife 's tiny ( 999 sq . mi. ) , neutral land right beside which Germans and French were fighting ( see p. 15 ) . Courtly , friendly Felix left too soon to hear the news about one of Luxembourg 's several unsalaried consuls in the U. S. <P> Consul in charge of any relations which Luxembourg may have in seven Far Western States , Alaska and Hawaii is one Prosper Reiter . Last month Sheriff E. W. Biscailuz of Los Angeles County , Calif. , said his vice squad visited the white , rambling Reiter residence and office near Hollywood . The Sheriff subsequently complained to Attorney General Earl Warren of California that the place was " an alleged gambling establishment , " added that diplomatic immunity protected Prosper Reiter and prevented his arrest so long as he stayed in the consulate . " If the evidence warrants my doing so , " continued Sheriff Biscailuz , " I am going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the ( Consul 's ) exequatur ( credentials ) . . . revoked . " <P> Undeterred by immunity , a reporter for the Los Angeles Herald and Express last week talked his way past guards at the gate . Next day the Herald and Express printed four columns of detail about roulette ( 10 a chip ) and bingo ( 10 a card ) in the consulate 's shoddy rooms . An attendant was quoted : " . . . We do n't have craps or the other games . Just bingo and the wheels . We could have craps , of course , but that would make it too much like a gambling joint . "
