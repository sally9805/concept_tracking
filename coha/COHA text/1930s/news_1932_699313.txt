txt The Board of Estimate instructed Corporation Counsel Arthur J. W. Hilly yesterday to prepare two bills aimed at repeal of mandatory salary legislation by a special session of the Legislature on Dec. 9 , after Con1 troller Charles W. Berry had issued a financial statement showing that Dec. 15 payrolls would not be met if the city paid its other maturing obligations and no new loans were arranged meantime . Losing no time , Acting Mayor Joseph V. summoned the Board of Estimate in executive session within a few hours after his return from the conference of bankers and city officials with Acting Governor Herbert H. Lehman on Thursday night . Colonel Lehman sent out a call from Albany yesterday for the special session to convene at 2 o'clock on the afternoon of Dec. 9 to consider repeal of the legislation which now compels the city to pay a large I proportion of its employes at fixed rates . With unanimous agreement by the board , the Corporation Counsel was instructed to present his draft of the two bills at another executive session on Monday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeal of mandatory legislation and the resumption of control over citypaid salaries by the Board of Estimate . The second bill provides for reopening the city budget before March 1 to make the reductions effective next year . City Bonds Lower . City bonds closed a fraction lower last night , indicating that the city 's eleventh-hour economy efforts made no favorable impression in the bond market . Bankers bore out this interpretation , declining to be impressed by anything short of actual blackand-white budget reduction . Members of the banking group expressed relief that the Controller , in his financial statement yesterday , had told the whole truth about the city 's financial status and had shown that the scope of the city 's difficulties was far wider than the single item of $3,500,000 for unemployment relief which the bankers refused to finance . Acting Mayor disclosed that the bankers still had $11,500,000 in city bonds of a $21,000,000 allotment which they took in October and were unable to dispose of . Mr. Berry 's financial statement contained most of the details discussed at the Albany conference on Thursday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's finances than the twenty-two page report made by the Controller to the Board of Estimate ten days ago . Unless the $151,000,000 revolving credit given to the city for the last half of this year could be renewed or extended by Dec. 15 , the Controller said the city could not meet all its obligations . He said $52,000,000 of the cash on hand must go to redeem rapid transit bonds maturing on Dec. 15 . The city can count only on $50,000 , - 000 additional up to the middle of this month . If that money be applied to payment of the revenue bills in the $151,000,000 revolving credit , the city can not meet its payrolls on Dec. 15 , the Controller said . In his twelve-point economy program , submitted to the Board of Estimate on Nov. 22 , the Controller discussed the city 's tax collections in the following terms : " This statement of actual realization of taxes , viz. , taxes collected by the City of New York during the past two years , compares more than favorably with the experience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of any large State in the Union , or of the Federal Government itself , or of any large corporation . " It is a statement of realization which , considering the wide depression existing , and from which the City of New York is perhaps suffering more than its share , should be highly gratifying to every one interested in the city 's financial condition and should give absolute assurance to every holder of its bonds as to the continued ability of the city to meet all its obligations , as it always has done . " Nine days ago the Controller said he would have a $90,000,000 surplus on Dec. 2 after meeting all the city 's obligations up to that date . Asked then whether the ctiy would meet its December payrolls , he said : " Most certainly the city will be able to meet these payrolls . I will have an estimated surplus of $90,000 , - 000 more than I will need for expenses . My payrolls on Dec. 1 total $8,600,000 . On Dec. 15 my payrolls are $12,200,000 . The teachers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can easily see , despite propaganda of any kind , I will have no difficulty in meeting my payrolls . " The total payrolls for December , as stated by the Controller on Nov. 23. were $32,500,000 . His financial statement yesterday listed the total payrolls for that month as $34,250,000 , or an increase of $1,750,000. $144,600,000 Loan Needed . The city must meet obligations amounting to $270,600,000 this month . It has $100,500,000 on hand and expects $25,500,000 in receipts this month , making its total resources $126,000,000 . To meet all its obligations it must borrow ; 144,600,000 . When the $151,000,000 revolving credit was established against tax receipts for the last half of this year , the bankers stipulated that the credit must be repaid in full by Dec. 15 if the city wanted to use an additional credit of $74,000,000 which would then be made available from Dec. 15 to April 30 , 1933 . Should the city not wipe out the entire $151,000,000 loan by mid-December , the $74,000,000 additional credit will not be made available . The Controller 's hope that the $151 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refusal in Wall Street yesterday , with the bankers pointing out that the loan could not be renewed or extended by the very agreement under which it was first made available . Tax collections , which were expected to repay the loan , fell more than $24,600,000 below the 1931 collections up to Nov. 30 . The Controller on Nov. 22 said that " our tax collections are not unduly in arrears . " Asked on his return from Albany yesterday how he could reconcile his earlier statements on city finances with the statement he issued yesterday , Mr. Berry said : " You reporters do n't understand city finances . You 're always putting garbled accounts in the papers . " No Assurance from Bankers . Sharing the relief of the bankers that the city 's real position had finally been disclosed . Acting Mayor said yesterday : " The Controller wrote me a letter setting forth the city 's financial position last Monday . His statement today brings those figures up to date . On Tuesday at a conference of city officials and , , bankers the Berry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the city 's real situation had not been disclosed . I said publicly that I did not know what the city 's financial status was . " In answer to questions on the results of the conference at Albany on Thursday night , which broke up at 3:15 yesterday morning , the Acting Mayor said the bankers had given the city " no assurances of any kind " on further loans . He added that leaders of the Legislature had given the city no assurances on the fate of its salary reduction bills in that body . He said Controller Berry had presented complete details of the city 's fiscal position at the conference , but would make no comment on his statement yesterday , except to pledge his cooperation with any program laid out by the Board of Estimate which was consistent with the city 's welfare . Mr. said complications might arise to delay the city 's plans because of constitutional provisions safeguarding teachers ' salaries . He said he understood that the Legislature alone had power to reduce teachers ' salaries , and that the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No Market for Bonds , He Says . Discussing the state of the market for city securities , the Acting Mayor said : " The fundamental consideration in the entire situation is to restore the confidence of the investing public in city securities . The Federal Government is selling its short-term paper for less than 1 per cent . When the bankers tried to sell $21,000,000 in city bonds at 51/4 per cent in October they found themselves able to dispose of only $9,500,000 . They still have $11,500,000 of the paper on their shelves . Since Nov. 17 they have sold less than $200,000 worth of city bonds . In other words , there is no market for city securities . " There is no question about the fundamental soundness of the city . A New York City bond is a first lien on all real estate in the city . When confidence in its securities is restored I think investors will rush in to buy them . " If the bankers continue their present attitude that genuine budget retrenchment must be an accomplished fact before further loans are granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal activities within one week . All unemployment relief will stop on Dec. 17 unless borrowed funds are provided . The Board of Estimate voted $1,000,000 for this relief yesterday , using money provided by the State which had already been ear-marked for use the early part of this month . The Acting Mayor said no solution had been found for the problem of continuing unemployment relief beyond Dec. 17 when the last funds will be exhausted . Revolving Credit Big Factor . The repayment of the $151,000,000 loan in the revolving credit is the chief factor in the city 's financial plight . One of the conditions under which this credit was arranged was that the city 's sinking fund be kept up ; consequently , the Controller must pay $52,000,000 of his cash assets into the rapid transit sinking fund for subway bonds maturing Dec. 15 . With only $50,000,000 in cash to go forward on between now and Dea. a2. the Controller can repay less than one-third of the $151,000,000 credit . The city has already contracted a $101,000,000 debt through defaulting on previously due par ments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolving credit by Dec. 15 , the bankers have agreed to set up a new credit of $74,000,000 against tax collections for the first half of next year . This loan is entirely dependent on complete repayment of the city 's $151,000,000 debt to the bankers . The Controller is thus in the position of seeking new loans to repay old loans , and even if the bankers were willing to advance the $74,000,000 on Dec. 15 , that amount would not be sufficient to extinguish the city 's present indebtedness with all the city 's cash resources of $50,000,000 added to it . Of the $151,000,000 credit , all but $26,000,000 is due within a week . On Dec. 5 the city had agreed to repay $15,000,000 ; on the 6th , $15,000,000 ; on the 7th , $40,000,000 ; on Dec. 8 , $25,000,000 ; on Dec. 9 , $30,000,000 , and on Dec .. 12 , $6,000,000 . The final payment of $20,000,000 is due on Dec. 13 . Controller Berry said in his statement yesterday that a default on the city notes held by the investing public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securities . The bankers disclosed that about 60 per cent of the notes were already in the hands of the investing public . See Assessments Too High . As evidence of the essential solvency of the city , the Controller 's report pointed to the amount of $160 , - 027,000 in outstanding realty taxes uncollected on Dec. 1 . Members of the banking group who have been dealing with the city feel that the city 's assessed valuations on real estate for tax purposes are far too high . Unless the valuations are reduced they predict that many owners will not be able to pay their taxes next year , with a consequent reduction in the city 's income . Unless the city reduces its expenses in anticipation of this probability , the bankers consider it futile to make further loans , which , they feel , would only have the effect of supporting assessed valuations on an artificially high plane . Assessed valuations are a major consideration with the bankers because 10 per cent of the total assessed valuations constitutes the city 's debt-incurring power . Should the valuations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the city would automatically reduce its power to incur debt and thus strengthen the whole structure of its credit . Salary reductions and other retrenchments would aid in restoring the city 's credit to a basis that would warrant further loans , the bankers feel . Extent of Cuts Undetermined . Acting Mayor said the board had not yet determined on the amount of salary reduction to be effected , though previous reports set $20,000,000 as the goal . On Monday the secretary of the board , Peter J. , and Budget Director Charles L. Kohler will present several schedules showing the amounts that could be saved under varying percentages of reduction . Protection of the pension rights of those whose salaries are affected will be an important topic in the discussion . The budget director will also present information showing the city salaries that may be cut immediately , as well as those that require new legislation before they can be reduced . This data will include the status of salaries paid to elected officials , which by law may not be changed during their terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary , and it is understood that other elected officials may do the same . With detailed information on salaries at hand . tile Board of Estimate will proceed to agree on a specific policy for salary reduction on a broad scale . The proposal to exclude salaries of $2,000 and less from any reduction program has strong support in the board , and it is not likely that these will be affected . Ranging upward from that figure , however , all salaries in the administration are to be slashed , it appeared last night . Hail Special Session Move . The action of the city officials in obtaining a special session of the Legislature to repeal mandatory salary provisions is a long step in the right direction , but by no means indicates that the city 's difficulties are over , leading Wall Street bankers said yesterday . Thus far , they pointed out , there has not even been a definite statement from City Hall as to what the city will do once it has the power to reduce salaries nor as to how deeply the budget will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed , the bankers reiterated , when mere promises and signs of good intentions could have an influence upon the market for New York City bonds . At the same time some hope was held out that if the city acted promptly enough and gave convincing evidence of its readiness to retrench a sufficient improvement in the city 's credit might take place before the necessary steps had all been consummated to enable bankers to come to the relief of the local administration . Mayor 's statement that of the $21,500,000 of 5V4 , per cent special corporate stock notes recently underwritten by bankers , $11,500,000 still remains on the shelves of the bankers , unsold , was confirmed at the offices of the issuing banks . This circumstance , it was pointed out , is sufficient commentary on the state of the city 's credit to need no amplification.
