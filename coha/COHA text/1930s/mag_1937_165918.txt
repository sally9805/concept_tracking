In Manhattan last week the retail price of eggs dropped suddenly 5 to 6 a dozen . Same time , in Ohio , the hastily organized flood relief committee ( see p. 12 ) learned that thousands of dozens of eggs were at its disposal for feeding the destitute . These two items of good news for egg-eaters were the complementary results of a single Government action to stabilize the egg market . Responsible for both was Henry Agard Wallace 's Surplus Commodities Corp. , an AAAffiliate . Most important natural factor in determining the price of eggs is the laying behavior of the hen . In spring , the big egg-laying season , eggs are ordinarily plentiful and cheap . In autumn and winter , hens are less productive , more storage eggs are sold , egg prices rise . <P> Because a hen can recognize winter or spring only by the way she feels , unseasonable weather may disturb this rhythm . <P> To hens in the East , the mild , muddy winter of 1936-37 has seemed enough like spring to stimulate prodigious , pre-seasonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more pails of fresh eggs than they could sell . Early last month the New York egg market was glutted , wholesale prices were abnormally low , farmers were beginning to reduce chicken feed and to slaughter too-productive pullets . Meanwhile the great chain grocery stores which sell New Yorkers about one billion eggs a year were making about 11 a dozen on the spread between wholesale and retail prices . Upon this scene moved Surplus Commodities Corp . To strengthen the wholesale market it recommended , and Secretary Wallace approved , purchase of 179,000 dozen eggs on the New York Mercantile Exchange . <P> Though the immediate effect of this was to attract an even larger number of egg-sellers to the New York market than before , by week 's end wholesale prices had steadied , moved up a little . Surplus Commodities Corp . hoped that this would dissuade poultry farmers from cutting down on feed and hatchings , thereby causing an egg shortage next autumn . <P> Eggs bought in New York and later in the West were routed to relief agencies in the flood area . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg consumption would reduce the surplus-pre-sided the angel of publicity . Spotting government concern over eggs , the vigilant New York World-Telegram announced with three-column headlines that chain grocers whose eggs cost them 34 a dozen were selling them for 45 , making three times as much profit as they made in 1935 . " There is no known method , " said the World-Telegram blandly , " of forcing the chains to reduce their retail price ... so that consumers can use and farmers sell more eggs . " Four days later almost every large chain in New York City had cut its egg profits in half .
