While President Roosevelt and others tried to help the Jews last week ( see p. 10 ) , actual help was brought by Miss Dorothy Thompson ( Mrs. Sinclair Lewis ) to the Jew most nearly concerned , 17-year-old Herschel Grynszpan . Neither he nor anyone else denies that he shot and killed in the German Embassy at Paris , after asking to see the Ambassador , Third Secretary Ernst vom Rath . <P> After radiorating a " Help Grynszpan ! " appeal , which she addressed exclusively to Aryans , Miss Thompson had received at latest reports more than $20,000 in voluntary contributions , and was busy at an office she had opened on Fifth Avenue , Manhattan . <P> If Grynszpan is saved from the guillotine it will make Clarence Darrow 's snatching of Leopold and Loeb from the gallows seem like a successfully pleaded traffic case . However , Miss Thompson was able , with $10.000 ( 213.000 francs ) in hand , to hire the Clarence Darrow of the Paris bar , the great Maitre Vincent de Moro-Giafferri , a fiery Paris-born Corsican who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Technical Instruction . <P> Maitre Moro-Giafferri has won many famous French criminal cases . His most celebrated defense , although it failed , was that of " the French Bluebeard , " Henri Desire Landru , accused of butchering ten women and a boy . The defense arguments in this case are still regarded by members of the Paris bar as tops in technical perfection and legal virtuosity . Landru was guillotined February 15 , 1922 . <P> French juridical experts said this week they did not see how Grynszpan can escape the death penalty in France , except by commutation of sentence or pardon , unless he can be extradited to some other country . He is a Polish citizen and if extradited to that rather anti-Semite country would undoubtedly fare worse than in France . For President Albert Lebrun to pardon the assassin or commute a death sentence on Herschel Grynszpan to life imprisonment would be to provoke openly Adolf Hitler , who would also be provoked by any attempt to prove the assassin insane . Thus far all Grynszpan 's statements have been perfectly coherent admissions that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the thousands of refugees from Naziland who are now in desperate straits in France . <P> Assassin Grynszpan , further grilled by detectives of the French Surete Generate last week in efforts to find out whether he had accomplices , sobbed over &; over : " My motive was love of the Jewish people ! " ( see below ) .
