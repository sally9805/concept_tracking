txt Presi ? dent Hoover has appealed to leading railway presidents of the country , as well as to representatives of railway labor , to postpone the discussion of further wage cuts until the end of the present year . The attitude of the President was communicated personally by him last week to representatives of both the railways and rail labor organizations , with whom he discussed the matter at the White House , but that fact was not revealed until late this afternoon when it was announced by Secretary of Labor Doak . Mr. Doak 's announcement of the President 's desire for a postpone , ment of a reopening of the railway 7. - 7ge cut question was made after he had conferred with the President at the White House today regarding the latest aspects of the situation . The President 's position was pleasing to railroad labor , whose leaders visited - the White House last week to protest against any discussion at this time . Inasmuch as Mr. Doak 's statement said that the President had made known his opinion to railroad presidents it was believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delay . Holds Situation Will Be Clearer . Secretary Doak 's statement , which referred to the informal *age Out conversations last week between the railroad management committee and the railway labor executives ' association , said : " In the matter of the railway wage discussion now going on , the President last week expressed the view , both to the representatives of railway labor and to the leading railway presidents who have conferred with him , that he felt that it is desirable that this question should be deferred at the present time . " The present agreement does not expire until Feb. 1 next . The President 's view was that it might be well agreed to defer further discussion until the end of the year , as the general economic situation would be much clearer at that time , and negotiations could be based on a better realization of the actual circumstances existing . " In connection with the statement it was learned that Daniel Willard , president of the Baltimore &; Ohio , conferred with A. F. Whitney , head of the railway labor executives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day . Particular significance attaches to these meetings , inasmuch as Mr. Willard headed the railroad executives ' committee which negotiated the present voluntary 10 per cent wage cut agreement in Chicago last year . That agreement would expire Feb. 1 , and the railroad managers have been considering a 20 per cent cut to supplant it , but the labor leaders last week declined to enter into any negotiations with the executives concerning wage reductions . The labor leaders in fact told W. F. Thiehoff , head of the railroad management committee , that this was no time to bring up the subject . A day later they assured the President in a formal communication that they unanimously opposed discussing wage cuts , which they said would lower living standards and break down the buying power of the workers . The railroad management committee left Washington undecided as to its next step . Informally some of the committee members said that they had failed in an attempt to induce the railway labor men to begin discussion of a voluntary 15 per cent reduction , and that it might now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set in motion the machinery for a 20 per cent drop in wages . Present indications are that nothing will be done about a new wage cut at least until the year ends . The railway labor men are adamant and the administration apparently hopes for some upturn in business conditions that may avert a slash in the railroad labor pay . By that time the condition of the carriers may have improved , officials believe , with the possibility that the contemplated 20 per cent cut may be adjusted on some other basis . Government officers tonight indicated that even if the railroads felt a 20 per cent cut was necessary on Jan. 1 , they would still have time under the railway labor act to send out the requisite notices and put the cut into effect before Feb. 1 . In opposing a wage cut at this time , the railway labor men told President Hoover that many of the " expectations " held forth when the 10 per cent cut went into effect had not materialized . One of these expectations was increased employment . I. C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is believed to have hinged around that subject occurred this afternoon between members of Division 6 of the Interstate Commerce Commission comprising Commissioners Eastman , Meyer , Brainard and Mahaffie , in charge of loans to railroads from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation , and the corporation 's board of directors . While there was no statement concerning the exact nature of the conference it was understood to have dealt with applications for " work loans " under the Administration 's program for purchasing of equipment not entirely essential at this time . Thb only advance to date of this type waa one of $2,000,000 to the Pennsylvania Railroad for the construction of freight cars , but several applications are pending before the commission and others , including one from the Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad , are expected in the near future . Fred W. Sargent , president of the Chicago &; Northwestern Railroad , conferred with the directors of the corporation on a proposal that it lend the road $1,000,000 to be used for purchasing railroad ties . Mr. Sargent explained that his road would have no use for the ties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materially assist the lumber industry in territory traversed by his line and provide employment . Coolidge Survey Enlarged . The scope of activities and Interests of the new Coolidge commission for surveying the situation at present prevailing among the railroads of the country is now being enlarged to include all the transportation facilities of the nation , including buses , trucks , pipe lines and other carriers , as well as the railroads , according to further information received in the financial centre yesterday . Formation of the commission , which will include four nationally prominent men in addition to the former President , will be announced today or tomorrow if the present plans are followed . The group will be non-partisan in nature and will probably be made up of two prominent Republicans , two prominent Democrats and a railroad operating specialist . While the commission may seek advice and information from leading large investors in railroad securities such as the savings banks , insurance companies and other institutional investors , latest reports indicate that it will neither directly represent nor be indirectly sponsored by any of these . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spontaneous " in nature , arising from what is said to be the immediate need of a thorough survey of the transportation situation in this country . Hope Held for Remedial Plan . A large group of technicians will be employed by the group for the purpose of making a most detailed study and it is predicted that the first report , expected within five or six months after its formation , will include some far-reaching suggestions for remedial legislation , both nationally and in the various States . The independence of the group from pressure by any interested parties , as well as the reputations of its members , is expected to add great weight to whatever conclusions it reaches . As a result of the depression the railroads of the country have suffered severely in reduced shipments of goods , and consequently the large investors in railroad bonds have also been seriously affected . Hope is held that the new commission may devise some plan by which the roads may be put back on a sound operating basis .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
