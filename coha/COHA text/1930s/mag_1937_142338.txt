Empire and world interest focused last week on a tiny old man with a knob of a head , thin greying hair and gold-rimmed spectacles . This was the mysterious " intervener " in the divorce case of Mrs. Simpson . It was he who alone seized and exercised a right possessed by every British subject after a decree nisi of divorce has been granted in the Kingdom , namely the right at any time in the following six months to tip off the King 's Proctor that there is something fishy about the case and demand that the Attorney General reopen it with a view to having the final decree of divorce blocked , thus leaving husband and wife united in what witty A. P. Herbert , M. P .. made the title of a divorce novel - Holy Deadlock . <P> A ripple ran round the London court last week as the intervener 's name was at last revealed to be Francis Stephenson . On Dec. 9 , King Edward , then wrestling with the problem whether or not to abdicate , was told that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Simpson holy deadlocked , and on Dec. 10 His Majesty decided to abdicate . On Dec. 14 the knob-headed little intervener moved to withdraw his intervention . He was in court last week to explain his series of actions - so suggestive of a successful effort to bamboozle an overwrought man in love , especially since knob-head Stephenson plies the trade of managing clerk in a firm of London lawyers whose important clients unquestionably sided with the Rt . Hon. Stanley Baldwin . <P> Emotion , not facts , carried the Prime Minister to magnificent success in the Abdication Crisis , and last week Intervener Stephenson explained his actions entirely in terms of most convincing British emotion . " I had not an ounce of respect left for Mrs. Simpson , " he sturdily declared . " It was just that I was so much moved by the words of His late Majesty 's broadcast . <P> When I heard His Majesty 's final words - 'I can not carry on without the woman I love-I realized I still had respect tor him . ... I had enough loyalty left for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " <P> In his wig and gown Sir Boyd Merriman , * presiding in Court last week , fussed about , patiently searching for some peccadillo or infraction . A small one would testify to his conscientiousness and not impede dismissal of the intervention . Suddenly he fastened upon the fact that Mrs. Simpson , although she had a flat in London , got her decree nisi out at rural Ipswich . Last week the judge badgered her Empire-famed and highly paid counsel , Norman Birkett , K. C. , upon this point . <P> To breathless lay spectators the implication of the Court 's questions seemed to he that if there was anything fishy about the " residence " of Mrs. Simpson at Ipswich- which was of only a few days duration- that is , if she was really a resident of London and had just skipped out into the country in an effort to dodge reporters , then that tiny but grim legal point could make the whole divorce fishy and perhaps void . <P> With the experience of a great K. C. , eminent Norman Birkett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right number of minutes , stated bluntly that Mrs. Simpson had gone to Ipswich for exactly the reasons the Court seemed to suspect .
