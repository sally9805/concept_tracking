The British Government , although continuing to insist that Viscount Runciman arrived in Prague last week as a " purely private person , " engaged a 15-room suite for him at the Alcron Hotel-long the favorite resort of Sudeten German politicians-and proceeded to pay all the bills . <P> Continentals expect an Englishman to arrive on diplomatic missions with an odor of sanctity , and Prague was not surprised to read that before Lord Runciman left Cowes , where he had been yachting , he bowed his head in its Holy Trinity Church while the vicar intoned a prayer " for one who is about to go to Czechoslovakia . . . . <P> May he be successful in insuring peace in that country ! " Ace London Cartoonist David Low went to town on the angelic chord ( see cut ) . <P> A mountain of luggage , exceptional even for a traveling British peer , went with Lord &; Lady Runciman to Prague . He told reporters : " I may stay a month , or it may be three months . " The Czechoslovak Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in top hats to meet a Purely Private Person at the station , sent their own top hats , and in every observable respect Britain 's unofficial mediator became official . His large staff of British Civil Servants released press handouts on crisp sheets headed " From Lord Runciman 's Mission . " In his first public utterance at Prague the Viscount created a great stir by thanking Sudeten German delegates for having met him at the station . Vexed Czechs made tart comments . Sudetens , learning with glee that " the British milord speaks German but he does not speak Czech , " began referring to him as " Runzelmann " - which , freely translated , means The Man With the Wrinkled ( i.e. , Thoughtful ) Brow . <P> Konrad Henlein , the Sudeten German Fhrer , sent only subordinates to confer with the Viscount . The consideration with which he treated them was considered spectacular . Lord Runciman 's program included 20-minute formal calls on President Eduard Benes and Premier Milan Hodza ; two lengthy conferences with henchmen of Henlein , the second lasting until 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mme Benes ; a short conference at his hotel with non-Nazi Czech Germans . <P> On the third day the British mediator uncorked his first proposal . He declared that before he could attempt to advise he must understand the problems of Czechoslovakia , must study them for at least a fortnight . Therefore , he proposed that the Government and the Sudetens stop negotiating while he studied . To this provisional Pax Runciman they agreed . Instead of discussing the disputed Minorities Statute , the Czechoslovak Parliament met for only 20 minutes-its first meeting since the war crisis was averted on May 21 - then meekly adjourned indefinitely . <P> Meanwhile , tourist travel to Prague picked up magically overnight . Tourists wolfed tasty Prager ham and downed it with Pilsner beer , convinced that they were safe so long as The Man With the Wrinkled Brow continues his studies . <P> When U. S. Ambassador to Germany Hugh Wilson , an ace career diplomat , suddenly flew to Prague on what he carefully described as " just a holiday visit " to his friend U. S. Minister to Czechoslovakia Wilbur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
