Manager of the Retail Trade Board of the Boston Chamber of Commerce since 1923 has been a ruddy , white-crested lawyer of 47 named Daniel Bloomfield . A relative by marriage of both the Morgenthau and Filene families , Dan Bloomfield began his career as Lincoln Filene 's associate in Boston 's big Filene department store . In 1928 he conceived an idea which seemed unlikely to set the world afire : a Conference on Distribution to parallel the conference on national and international problems held annually by the Institute of Human Relations at Williamstown , Mass . But under two enthusiasts , Dan Bloomfield and President Patrick Augustin O'Connell , of Boston 's Retail Trade Board , conferences have been held every year since then . Last week when the ninth annual conference met in Boston , it proved rather conclusively that Mr. Bloomfield had had a good idea . <P> For Williamstown 's conferences are generally attended by earnest souls who would like to see something done about the ills of the world , rather than by the heads of governments who might actually do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank- &-file; attendants some 750 business men actively engaged in distribution , had such headline speakers as President Percy Straus of R. H. Macy &; Co. , General R. E. Wood , president of Sears , Roebuck &; Co. , President Oswald Knauth of Associated Dry Goods Corp. , Cosmetician Elizabeth Arden , Professor Paul H. Nystrom of Columbia University , President Karl T. Compton of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and not least of all , Secretary of State Cordell Hull . To garnish this group as chairman of the first day 's luncheon session , Director Bloomfield had little difficulty in getting the services of James Roosevelt , who for his own reasons always likes to have a finger in Boston goings-on . <P> High-spot of the two-day conclave was the aggressive speech of Professor Nystrom . Introduced by Chairman Roosevelt Mr. Nystrom , an authority on business trends , lashed out at irresponsibility of labor unions in a way which just as visibly embarrassed the President 's son as it delighted the audience . Said he : " . . . There is resistance on the part of employers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what lies behind it . Unfortunately , to many employers , it looks as if any invitation , either of labor to management or of management to labor , to sup at a common table is likely to result noc only in the disappearance of the food but also of the dishes , and in the destruction of the table as well . " <P> Of more lasting import were the remarks of three other speakers which , like chapters of a book , unfolded as clearly as has yet been done the most important basic problem of distribution , international trade .
