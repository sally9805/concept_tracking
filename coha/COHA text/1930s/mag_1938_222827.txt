In a steaming bamboo hut near Manila , a lean , bronzed young U. S. chemist sat with a small native child on his knees . The child lay rigid , its face , arms and legs swollen , the rest of its body wasted . The child whimpered at the burning pain in his heart and intestines . He was dying of beriberi , ancient Oriental disease . The chemist thrust a few drops of an extract from rice hulls between the child 's lips . Almost instantly the boy revived , and young Chemist Robert Runnels Williams , India-born son of U. S. missionaries , knew that he had saved a life by means of a strange , almost unheard-of ingredient of food , a substance which in its impure state came to be called vitamin B ( for beri-beri ) . At once he decided what course he would follow in the years ahead . <P> Now , 28 years later , Dr. ( Sc . D. ) Williams , chemical director of the Bell Telephone Laboratories , has succeeded in synthesizing the curative substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American Medical Association , he re-named the vitamin thiamin because it contains sulfur ( Greek theion ) . The American Chemical Society this spring awarded Dr. Williams its Willard Gibbs ( highest ) Medal . Science has just published a detailed article by him . " The Chemistry and Biological Significance of Thiamin . " And next week Macmillan 's will publish Vitamin B1 and its Use in Medicine ( $5 ) , which he wrote with Dr. Tom Douglas Spies of Cincinnati , a medical vitamin specialist . Dr. Williams , still zealous at 52 , says : " The study of vitamins may some day be regarded as rivaling in importance the discovery of micro-organisms as causative factors in disease . . . . It would be misleading to suppose that thiamin is the only vitamin which possesses a universal or nearly universal function in living cells . . . . But the lack of no other accessory substance leads to so early , so profound and so universal disaster . " <P> The movements of a pigeon deprived of thiamin " consist in turning cart wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human being , similarly starved of this nutritional necessity , may die of sudden heart failure . Less spectacular effects of B2 deficiency are , according to investigators , degeneration of the nervous system , enlargement of the heart , atrophy of muscles , loss of appetite , atony of the colon , stomach ulcers , loss of weight , failure to grow . <P> In nature thiamin appears abundantly in egg yolks , lean pork , crude molasses , peas and peanuts . It is found most abundantly in the germs of ripe grain . Millers discard such " hearts of wheat " to make white flour , causing Dr. Williams to cry : " Man commits a crime against nature when he eats the starch from the seed and throws away the mechanism necessary for the metabolism of that starch . " <P> *The " vitamin B complex " contains at least 15 different entities , including B1 ( prevents beri-beri ) ; Bu ( called riboflavin , prevents cataracts ) ; nicotinic acid ( prevents pellagra ) ; a factor which prevents grey hair .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
