txt The attitude of the British Government toward a " new Locarno " was defined by Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden during the three-power conversations that took place here on July 23 . When the text of the communiqu ? issued that day had been finally approved by the British , French and Belgian conferees , Mr. Eden said that " this is the final test of the sincerity of the intentions of Germany to work for the peace of Europe . " , Then Vis1count Halifax , British Lord Privy Seal , proposed the immediate communication in Berlin by the Ambassadors of the three powers of an invitation to Germany to attend a new five-power conference . The British Government is under no illusion as to the gravity of the situation . It has firmly decided to prosecute the attempt at conciliation of Germany while the slightest hope remains of reaching an agreement . If obliged to admit failure , it will proceed to transform the present consultations among the general staffs of Britain , France and Belgium into a permanent military committee , as promised last March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created by the German reoccupation of the demilitarized zone on the Rhine , Ready to Try Every Course The British Ministers consider it necessary to carry the attempt at conciliation to the utmost limit , not only because they are sincerely peace-loving , but also because they desire to educate public opinion , proving to it that everything humanly possible has been done to avoid forcible action . They are confirmed in this policy by the discovery that the French Government is even more anxious for peace that they themselves . Germany 's acceptance of the Invitation to attend a five-power conference was received here with satisfaction . But the satisfaction was tempered with a coolness caused by the fact that the assent had been qualified by the condition of preliminary diplomatic negotiation , which at best means a long period of haggling and possibly a breakdown before the meeting takes place . London is certain that one of the principal reasons that prompted Chancellor Adolf Hitler to accept the invitation was that Rome had informed him of its decision to delay acceptance no longer . If Italy had come alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been left very much in the cold . Reich Relies on Past Success Evidently , too , German diplomacy relies upon past experience again to obtain from Britain and France far-reaching concessions by dangling in front of them the menace of constantly increasing armaments . The British Ministers recognize that the repeated successes of this method encourage Hitler to pursue the well-tried policy of " grab what you can without shooting. , , The British Government knows now , however , exactly where is the chief difficulty in concluding a satisfactory new Locarno treaty . The Germans wish to limit it strictly to the group of Western powers without letting themselves be tied in any way to other parts of Europe , where they desire to remain free to pursue a policy of political expansion by force if necessary . Yet a Western pact is useless if it is not accompanied by an agreement to limit armaments . Now that navies cease to play the leading part , air armaments come first If limitation Is to be real . But the Germans always have refused to accept a British or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to meet the menace of the ever-growing Russian fleet of war planes . Russia Must Be a Party There is a sound reason why Russia must be brought into any agreement , and then , too , the Little Entente powers  --  Czechoslovakia , Yugoslavia and Rumania  --  can not be neglected . Even if ' a pact , to please the Germans , were drawn up without the participation of Moscow , it could not become operative without Russia 's adhering to its terms . The history of the naval agreements now being negotiated with Germany and Russia is a good example of how these two countries interlock in Europe . When they were in London , Premier Leon Blum and Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos of France proposed , and the British Ministers endorsed , the principle that a Western pact could not be allowed to increase danger to peace in the rest of Europe . In other words , the British and French agreed to consider Europe as a whole for the purposes of a general settlement . It is difficult to see how the British Government can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible a Western pact may be negotiated first , provided an established general agreement must follow . Further complication is caused by the question of colonies . The German demand in this respect is catsgorical and undisguised . Last September Sir Samuel Hoare , in a speech at Geneva , indicated clearly the direction of the wind when he said the British Government admitted the necessity of discussing free access to raw materials . The meaning of this definite statement at the time was not enough considered  --  that Britain refuses to discuss the return of territorial sovereignty lost by Germany in 1918 . " Raspberry " Ready for Germany Mr. Eden 's latest speech in the House of Commons pointedly referred to the impossibility of discussing a transfer of mandates . Therefore , in spite of propaganda . it can be taken for granted that if Germany demands a return of her old colonies she will receive , as a leading personage put it to this writer , " the raspberry . " It is now seen here that optimism over the possibility of a meeting ' of a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the five powers meet before the Assembly of the League of Nations met at Geneva in that month , thus leaving the road clear for discussion of reform of the League covenant . Since Berlin desires carefully to prepare for the conference by means of ordinary diplomatic conversations beforehand , it is impossible to expect that anything useful could be achieved by meeting in August , even if this were technically possible . It is timely here to warn against attaching undue importance to the visit to Berlin of Sir Robert Vansittart , Permanent Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs , who has gone there to attend the Olympic Games , for which he reserved a seat long ago . It categorically may be asserted-Sir Robert has no mission to discuss the problem of a new Locarno with the German Government . No doubt he will meet representatives of the German Foreign Office and probably members of the government , but this contact is not intended to take the form of a discussion of steps for a Locarno settlement .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
