Five years ago Paul Bonynge , New York lawyer , first cousin of onetime Congressman Robert William Bonynge from Colorado , ran for the post of county judge in Long Island 's suburban Nassau County . Suave , patrician Paul Bonynge candidly told his constituents even in those Prohibition days that now and then , when he wanted a drink , he took it . He was beaten . Campaigning again on a platform " never to put a man in jail for things I do myself , " he was elected in 1932 a justice of New York 's Supreme Court ( equivalent to a superior court of original jurisdiction ) . On the bench he made a record as a notable debunker of legal folderol . <P> Last week before Justice Bonynge came the case of Percy C. Reed , owner of the Nassau Kennel Club , operator of dog races at the Mineola fairgrounds . Year ago Mr. Reed was accused of gambling , but the case was dismissed for want of evidence . Mr. Reed now appealed to Justice Bonynge for a declaratory judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made brisk reading . Excerpts : " The plaintiff operates under an ingeniously devised scheme , deliberately contrived to avoid the pitfalls of the Penal Law . In a word , he sells purchase options upon each dog in a race and , if these are not exercised , buys back such as he may elect at prices determined by him . Strange as it may seem , a considerable number of these options are actually exercised and result in authentic changes of ownership of dogs . The district attorney urges that these purchase options are a mere subterfuge and that the man who buys one of them for $2 merely intends , in truth and in fact , to lay a bet of that amount . Very possibly this is true . . . . <P> " Here the uncontradicted evidence shows that the plaintiff is actuated by the bona fide intent to give each and every patron a valid option to buy a particular dog . If such patrons choose to flaunt sic his good intentions and buy options to line their pockets with unholy gains they can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule otherwise , every cotton and commodity broker or dealer in the land would be in jail before nightfall . Does anyone suppose that the delicatessen dealer who buys an option on 500 bales of cotton ever intends to take delivery of it or that the salesgirl who acquires a future in 1,000 bushels of wheat will ultimately bake bread or make pancakes with the resultant flour ? * Let the vendor of an option establish that he is pure in heart and the law takes no account of the base motives of those who may deal with him . . . . <P> " . . . Is not a certain amount of naivete ... an essential adjunct to judicial office ? Does not the Supreme Court grind out thousands of divorces annually upon the stereotyped sin of the same big blonde attired in the same black silk pajamas ? Is not access to the chamber of love quite uniformly obtained by announcing that it is a maid bringing towels or a messenger boy with an urgent telegram ? . . .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
