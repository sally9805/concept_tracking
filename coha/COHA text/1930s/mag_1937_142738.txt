In Berlin 's Pltzensee Penitentiary last week a shining ax crashed down . Off rolled the head of intellectual Helmuth Hirsch , the 21-year-old Jew arrested last December for plotting to kill " a high German official " - subsequently believed to be Jew-baiter Julius Streicher-with a bomb ( TIME , May 3 ) . Hirsch 's family lives in Czechoslovakia , but U. S. diplomats in Berlin had taken him under their wing because his grandfather was a naturalized U. S. citizen . U. S. newspapers whooped for his life , but Hirsch , throughout his imprisonment , admitted he was guilty . He did not deny it in the letter he wrote to his family day before his death .
