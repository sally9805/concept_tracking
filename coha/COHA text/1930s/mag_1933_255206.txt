No TIME LIKE THE PRESENT-Storm Jameson-Knopj ( $2.50 ) . <P> Margaret Storm Jameson belongs to a hard-hit generation ( she calls it " the Class of 1914 " ) and she comes from hard-bitten Yorkshire . The combination , as readers of her novels will recognize , is not one that makes for softness or cares about charm . Good if somewhat angrily honest , her stories are apt to be bitter to palates accustomed to a sugaring of the pill . In No Time Like the Present , half autobiography and half indictment of a civilization that returns to war like a dog to its vomit , there is less sugaring than ever , more anger than usual , and the same hard honesty as always . <P> Born &; bred in the old seaport town of Whitby ( where she still lives ) she had an outdoor childhood , is sorry for those who do not . " Our only eternity is at the beginning of our lives and who if he could choose would choose to spend it in streets ? " She won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exception , all the young men who were my friends . . . were killed within the next three years . " At Leeds she worked erratically but well , took a First and won a research scholarship at University College in London . There she shared a study with three young men , impoverished , enthusiastic students like herself ; they worked , ate , argued apparently on terms of masculine equality . When , one day , Authoress Jameson had an article accepted by the New Age she was in the seventh heaven . " That paper was the Bible of our generation . We would rather go hungry than not buy it . We quoted it . argued with it , and formed ourselves on it . I suppose that Mr. A. R. Orage had a sharper influence on the young men of our day than any other man . . . . You got Orage as it might be religion-usually for life . " <P> Then came the War . Authoress Jameson has never gotten over it . Her brother was killed , most of her friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will say that it was worth while to kill my brother in his nineteenth year ? You may say that the world 's account is balanced by the item that we have with us still a number of elderly patriots , politicians , army contractors , women who obscenely presented white feathers . You will forgive me if , as courteously as is possible in the circumstances , I say that a field latrine is more use to humanity than these leavings . " In answer to the upholders of the late War she quotes Ezra Pound 's verse : <P> There died a myriad , And of the best , among them , For an old bitch gone in the teeth , For a botched civilisation . <P> She comments on peace pacts and disarmament conferences : " As though you could take out an injunction against a bayonet in your stomach or make a neat point against chaos . " <P> Authoress Jameson is not one who enjoys writing . Says she : " I would rather not write at all than write as I do , to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a born writer , and I should have been much happier as an engineer . . . . Each book now represents so many months of hard bitter effort and no moments of satisfaction . " But she despises writers ( especially popular ones ) who have no social conscience or are deliberately sentimental : " Nine out of ten novelists deserve to be prosecuted under an Adulterated Emotions Act . " <P> Married , Authoress Jameson is not raising her only son to be a soldier .
