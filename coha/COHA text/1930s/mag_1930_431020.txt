 | UNLESS you are a super-girl with more talent , more accomplishments , more grit , more endurance and stamina , and more resources than fall to the lot of most of Eve 's daughters , stay away from Hollywood and let your dream of a motion picture career be translated into something practical in your own town . You 'll be far happier . The pretty girl with what her family and friends regard as " extraordinary talent " has about one-fiftieth of the chance to become a successful motion picture actress that she has of being a successful poet , musician , or novelist . She stands about the same chance that she does of becoming a ranking star at the Metropolitan Opera in New York . Three years ago probably that statement would not have been true , for then the talking picture had not descended upon us . Probably this girl 's opportunities for screen preferment would have been nearly as good as in several other professions open to women , but today it is doubtful if even the exceptionally talented girl of more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fifty thousand of getting an opportunity in Hollywood , and certainly not more than one in a quarter-million of reaching the first ranks . It is not possible to prove this estimate ; it is merely opinion , but it is drawn from experience , sober judgment , and fact . In the United States , I am told , there are between four and a half and five million girls from eighteen to twenty-three , the years which span the limits for a newcomer to the screen . I doubt if seventy-five of them are even given trials at worth-while parts in all the studios during the year . Certainly not a dozen reached the top of the ladder during 1929 . If that sounds discouraging , frankly I mean it to be , and if it will keep even a few over-confident , under-equipped , and badly advised girls from coming to Hollywood to enter the most exhausting , heart-breaking , precarious struggle in America , I shall be thankful . No doubt the hopeful thousands will say that it is all very well for Mary Pickford to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position and has been able to maintain it . Well , for their information I have worked harder to reach that place ? and hold it ? than dozens of well-placed business executives . I have won nothing that I have not paid for in struggle ? nerveracking and exhaustive labor at all hours and under the most discouraging conditions . " But what a wonderful life when you do reach the top ! " has been said to me . Perhaps . I know this : there are few professions among the arts of today that demand so much from the individual as the talking motion picture . And admitting that the rewards at the top are magnificent , none of those who have reached the upper rungs of the ladder but will look back and wonder if they would have the courage to @#  | go through the long , hard climb to the top again . A few years ago the situation was different , though hard even then , but a fairly well-mannered girl with good looks , an agreeable personality , and a fair amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In addition she needed a few simple accomplishments , such as the ability to ride , swim , dance , and drive a car . Her destiny then depended largely on her ability to be at the right place at the right moment under the right conditions . No one is likely to accuse me of egotism if I say that I know more than a little of motion picture requirements and conditions . From the day when I walked into the old Biograph studio on Fourteenth Street in New York with one solitary nickel in my pocketbook , until today , I have fought hard for every point I have gained . There may have been girls to whom success came easily ? whose beauty and charm proved a passport to the heights ? but such success as I have had cost me dearly , not alone in effort and heartaches , but in the loss of one to whom I owe everything . @#  | " What numbers of perfectly beautiful girls ! " is the comment of nearly every celebrity who comes to Hollywood . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waitresses or cashiers , in the shops as saleswomen , in the offices as clerks , stenographers , and telephone operators . What drew them ? The lure of the motion picture . Some came supplied with funds and some with little but hope . Of the thousands who have gone again ? to their homes , or to other cities because they were ashamed to go home defeated ? some have gone at the expense of welfare organizations , and still others through the charity of kindly @#  | private sympathizers or on remittances from friends . As President of the Motion Picture Relief Fund I have had intimate knowledge of the distress that meets the unwanted in Hollywood . And please realize that a girl alone in a strange city and without sufficient money is in a situation far worse than a man or boy will meet ; first , because her opportunities for financing herself are fewer ; and second , because her labor market is more crowded ? even should she have a talent that she may turn to account . Each of us , no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewpoint . Each of us is the hub of a universe revolving about me . So we are of supreme importance to ourselves , and because of our ego we find it difficult to understand why the world is too busy or too obtuse to recognize and buy our small wares ? at our valuation . I must assume that , for otherwise it is difficult to account for the river of letters that flows in upon every motion picture player who has achieved a position . None of the writers seems to imagine that her letter is unique , or that any successful person should be unwilling to reply to just one appeal . Frankly I could n't read a fraction of the mail that begs for my advice or help or both . If I spent ten hours a day at them , I would still leave quantities unread , and so my secretary copes with them as best she may . She is a diligent person , long since inured , I hope , to the impossibility of her task . @# The Travellers Aid Society , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian Association all have the screen-struck girl to help . Not a train or bus arriving at Los Angeles but brings new recruits to the army . Looking back at my estimate of the one-in-fifty-thousand chance , I wonder if I have not put the odds too low . The screen 's demands today are so much greater than ever before , so much more exacting than the stage , and the lure of the well-advertised picture dollars and adulation is so intense that the screen will attract a hundred where the stage will draw but one . And if those who hurry here could only know what the situation is ! The Truth About Hollywood In Hollywood there is work for just over six hundred players each day ? men and women ! And this does not include the " extras , " as they are called ; the people who remain unidentified and who furnish merely atmosphere at a minimum wage ? occasionally . To supply that demand for the six hundred plus , there are over seven thousand competent actors and actresses of experience in Hollywood ! Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some with years of the stage and screen behind them ! They range from former stars of the spoken drama to featured players of the silent pictures . And more than six thousand three hundred are idle each working day in the year ! Moreover at least one-third of all the acting parts given out by the studios are filled by their own contract players , and of the remainder certainly less than one-quarter are young-girl parts , which leaves not more than one hundred girls in demand for each day . Chorus girls and specialty dancers are not included in that number ; merely actresses . You five million girls of America who have your eyes on Hollywood , you stand so pitiably small a chance here ! Today the screen requirements are almost impossible of fulfilment by one small feminine creature ? even if she is of the super-type . The demands are often antithetic , and the duration of screen usefulness is so much shorter than the stage , the concert platform , or any of the other artistic fields . It was that great actress , Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy of the stage is that one is not a competent actress until one has worked hard to glean experience , and when that experience  | is fully ripe , lo , age has crept in unawares ! " The screen of today demands the accomplished artist . The physically attractive girl who could be moved through pantomime by a competent director is no longer of use . The public discovered her shortcomings even more quickly than the producers of pictures . Comparisons were all too easy , and the charming idol fell too far short . In mentioning some of the necessities the newcomer must bring with her to the screen , I take them at random as they occur to me , and not in the order of what may or may not be their importance . Culture , education , intelligence , knowledge ? they are lumped together because they are usually the result of schooling of the right sort . The talking screen is no place for what the industry so unkindly calls the " dumb-bell . " Ordinary roles in today 's pictured stories are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they fall into the category of " characters . " The public I believe to be highly discriminating in such matters , and motion picture audiences are daily growing in appreciation of good acting talent . At heart most of us are idealists , and we find our interests much the same as the kindly old London shopkeeper when he said : " Life 's rough enough . If it was n't for fairy tales and ' igh ' opes and fancy dreams this world would be a dust-heap . So show us lords and ladies and pretty things as will keep us going . " Is Your Voice Cultivated ? It has been often said that the picture stars of the pre-talkie era were in the main quite commonplace young people . However , this was unimportant if only they seemed gracious and cultured ? as they did . Then the conversational deluge descended on us , and chaos was in our midst ! As a rule an agreeable , wellmodulated speaking voice is the result of a natural , suitable home environment , or a long period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired in a moment , as our studio producers discovered to their dismay , for when they rushed to the vocal teachers , crying , " Teach our stars to speak lines properly , " the teachers replied : " Certainly , but let us have them five or six years ago , and then give us from six months to a year to ground them in your special requirements . " Which simply means that cultivation of the voice is not a feat ; it is a process ? and apt to be a long one . Was it not Emerson who said , " Let me hear a man speak and I will tell you what he is . " Perhaps in America we have paid too little attention to the quality of our voices . And the microphone is a fiendishly acute taskmaster . So the screen aspirant now needs not elocution or stilted dramatic speech , but the cultured voice of the well-bred person . One may learn lines , parrot-like , but rarely can one learn and use inflection and diction so that it seems natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A player may step down from this to portray a rough , but the reverse is seldom or never convincing . The great success of such actresses as Ruth Chatterton and Ann Harding , for instance , converts from the speaking stage where they had already won acclaim , is due in no small measure to the thorough educational and cultural grounding they brought to their hitherto untried screen work . Once , perhaps , superficiality might pass the screen test , but the great stage actresses like Bernhardt , Ouse , Jane Hading , and Mrs. Patrick Campbell were educationally equipped long before they sought the stage . The latter , forced to take up governessing as a young girl , still was a gold medalist of the piano at the Berlin Conservatory of Music and a student of the classics . So think , you of the possible five million ,  | just what educational advantages you will bring with you to the screen ! Think well before you come to Hollywood , where the fiercest competition in the world is to be found ! Some present-day screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their opportunities as success came to them in the pre-talkie era , for they recognized that the mind needs exercise as well as the body . 1 think they realized that while intelligence may be inborn , culture is acquired . What Are Your Accomplishments ? And one needs accomplishments , even if they are never actually used for the screen . They give background , assurance , confidence . One of the things that makes Fred Stone the great comedian that he is comes from his ability to do many things well . He is a fine rifle shot , a graceful wire-walker , an exceptional boxer , a first-rate acrobat , a splendid dancer , and an adept at repartee . So tennis , golf , archery , swimming , riding , dancing are essentials , not merely a smattering , but competency , being needful . And music ? the piano for rhythm , the violin for grace ? is vital , for it gives poise , balance , and a sense of harmony that is of tremendous importance in timing action on the screen . Languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be , and there should be downright facility in their use , particularly French and Spanish . It is no secret that many of our best-loved players of the silent screen have dropped out . I wish it were not so . One studio retains two of its original group of more than twenty . The eighteen lacked something the talking screen must have , and they have gone ? with many others . As might have been expected , the studios rushed to the stage for artists when it was found that many of the old favorites were unable to meet the new conditions . But of the hundreds that were brought to Hollywood comparatively few have remained . For there is a difference ? if even a subtle one ? between stage and screen , and no assurance that preferment in one will find success in the other . Perhaps the difference may be expressed in this way : In the theatre there is a well-defined physical separation between player and audience . The latter is outside the scene of action , just a group of spectators on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen there is no such feeling of separation ; the audience is a part of the scene ? actually inside the room ? and this breeds an intimacy that affects everything portrayed . The voice that was resonant and harmonious , carrying well to all parts of an auditorium , is often affected and unreal when transmitted by microphone , for the talking mechanism tends to make words , language , and inflections exaggerated . So unless the young girl -- whom I have not discouraged-can bring something in the way of these essentials to the studio gates she stands small chance . " But , " some one says , " you have said nothing of beauty ! " Not because it is unimportant , however , but because alone it has so little value . If you are just a pretty girl , Hollywood has a thousand or more much prettier . Your beauty is only of value in combination with other cultivated or natural talents . What other talents ? Some I have mentioned above , and to them I must add a most important trait ? character . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of it . Without it the artist can hardly hope to survive . And I think people are not born with character ; they achieve it by the slowest of all building processes . I 'd say a girl 's success in any professional career will depend on her ability to develop character . In the past we have had on both stage and screen what are called " flash players " ; young people whose natural abilities fitted exactly some part they were called upon to play , but  | whose ability to acquire real talent through study and application was either missing or the opportunity ignored . They leaped into prominence in one role only to slip backward in the next . If good sense and good work are added to natural qualities , we may get star material ? we may ! Unfortunately for the lazy folk , natural talent is seldom sufficient . Promising girls have been deluded into believing that God has given them inexhaustible reservoirs of talent into which they need but dip as required . They seldom realize that the greatest artists are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrivaled success ? Paderewski practices from six to eight hours at his piano , Mischa Elman the same number at his violin , while Mme. Schumann-Heink at 63 is still working to improve her voice ! How Hard Will You Work ? One of the greatest triumphs of the talking screen is the amazing accomplishment of Gloria Swanson . There is no evading the fact that talking pictures challenged her screen position , as it did that of others ? to overcome most of them finally . But Gloria Swanson has an indomitable courage and has never been able to delude herself . She analyzed herself ruthlessly . What her first months of preparation for " The Trespasser " cost her I do not know , for she does not wear her professional heart on her sleeve , but the result was triumphant from every viewpoint . And Norma Shearer is another fine example of the value of character . She , too , had no easy task before her . She had no stage background to rely upon . She had risen to the heights , and then came the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last of Mrs. Cheyney , " they surrounded her with a company of the best stage players England and America could provide . So Norma Shearer called up her courage , native culture , and intelligence and more than held her own . That required deep wells of character . I said that few of the former screen players had survived the new era . Those still popular under dialogue conditions have had something more than physical attraction or equipment to offer . They have had definite abilities of which character is by no means the least . And they could not have formed that character without deliberate effort . Audiences , I am confident , react favorably to the positive qualities such as kindness , courtesy , gentleness , geniality , humor , beauty , symmetry , justice , courage , intelligence , sincerity . Having all or many of these constitutes charm , which , with talent and art , constitutes success . But above all the elements of character I think self-analysis among the most important . Are we subject to flattery , cajolery , indulgence , self-justification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , form a reasonable estimate uncolored by self-esteem or egotism ? If a girl who hopes for a screen career is reading these lines , I hope she will sit down quietly and make a list of the qualifications mentioned above . Then let her take them one by one and ask herself honestly if she possesses any considerable number of them , and if she possesses the courage to acquire those she has not . Can she stand disappointment ? Has she selfcontrol , determination , the ability to discipline herself ? Could she work for weeks , pouring her own money into the effort , admit the result unworthy , and cast it all aside ? Some have done just that ? one " junking " several hundred thousand dollars ' value in actually completed work because it was not good . No effort to salvage the wreck at all , when the decision was made . We are the architects of our own lives to an extent few of us realize . True , there are occasional accidents of career , but the greatest  | successes are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for truly " as a man thinketh in his heart so is he . " That talking pictures have come to stay I have not the least doubt . Their popularity is due to the fact that for the first time the greater part of America is coming in contact with finely portrayed drama ; the type of performance that has generally been the product of the large centers of population , and that consequently touched intimately but a fraction of the public , as much because of cost as because of defective distribution . That there is a difference between the manner in which stage and screen obtain dramatic effect is admitted , though I doubt if many of us who produce pictures know yet just what that difference is . Now producers of pictures are experimenting , but inevitably they will come back to simple , elemental drama ; the thing that touches the deep well-springs of life human love , human self-sacrifice , human emotions . We can not grow beyond these . If , as has been advanced , the future picture will differ more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its acting , there will be undoubted profit for the screen-struck girl ? providing that nothing I have said can deter her ? in studying the methods and technique of the established players on both stage and screen . If for a time the studios seemed to run to a standard type of young girl , that obsession is forgotten . Physicality has given way to artistry . Greto Garbo 's success with " Anna Christie " has shown conclusively that a great talent can rise above limitations supposed to be insurmountable . But she could not have succeeded without real artistry , and that did not come from any butterfly existence , but from laborious , sustained effort , day in and day out . And two outstanding triumphs of the talking screen have been won by two matured players who have spent long years in attaining their technique . Marie Dressler and Joseph Cawthorn have made tremendous impressions on the audiences of the world . And their success has been no accident . Is Religion a Part of Your Life ? Parents may wonder that so far I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the utmost frankness I believe there is no difference between the motion picture and any other profession in which women are thrown in contact with men . Morality , after all , is a matter of individual character more than environment , and the foundation of character is laid in the home . It should be unnecessary for me to stress this point . Those who need explanation will probably be unable to provide the foundations . Here in Hollywood we have a policewoman , Mrs. Lillian Toomey , who for over fifteen years has been looking after the women and the girls who come into the ken of the police . A woman of real character , with deep religious convictions and connections , she has no hesitation in saying that she believes the moral conditions of picture-making are on a par with those of any other industry . This , finally , I believe most firmly : That one of the most important requirements for the picture actress is some firm , workable religious affiliation . I do not mean a mere profession of faith , but something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily life . Not that it is more necessary , perhaps , than in other professions , but because it gives cultural as well as moral advantages that can not be rated of too high importance . When all is said , I can only repeat that the opportunity for even the highly talented and endowed girl is slight ; that she should stay away from Hollywood , and that her parents , if they can reasonably and justifiably do so , should help her express herself in another direction .
