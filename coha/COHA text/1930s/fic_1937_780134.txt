 | Chapter Six T HE WATER MAPLES HAD NEVER BEEN GREENER THAN ON THAT HOT JUNE DAY . THE LITTLE SPRING-FED brook was cool and musical . The brief patches of blue grass on the creek banks were as soft as a mattress . Corporal Walker Blount stretched luxuriously , lazily . His boots , folded across his saddle , made him a comfortable pillow . His bare feet dabbled in the running water . The war was doing pretty well for a young noncommissioned officer who had been ordered to establish an outpost between the Leesburg and Granny White pikes . Watching the two pikes that paralleled less than a mile apart , was easy if a man could find a hill that commanded a view of both , and he had found it . The purpose of his outpost did not worry him . When he first became a soldier he had worried a great deal about where he was going and what he was going for . But two years of riding behind Old Forrest had taken all the curiosity out of him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the column , it was on its  | way somewhere , and when it got there there would be some fighting . And then , perhaps before it was half finished , they would ride off somewhere else and start another . The outpost job was a welcome rest . His horse was gaunt and weakened , and he himself was saddle weary . " Outpost duty , " Walker 's troop-commander had told him briefly . " Watch Granny White and Leesburg 's pikes , from about here . " He indicated the position on a roughly sketched map . " If you see Yankees moving along Granny White , ride in this general direction until you join the command . If you see General Morgan 's column on Leesburg , identify yourself to him and say these words , The eagles cross at twentyfive . ' Join his command and answer any questions he asks . If you see neither by the twenty-third of the month , join your command . Pick five men and move out . " For three days a lookout had been kept on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for rations for the outpost . Two men and the corporal remained at the camp . Across the stream from Corporal Blount lay Private Roy Miller , who was reading indolently in a battered copy of Gray 's Anatomy . Downstream a little way , lying on his belly , his chin resting in his cupped palms , was sprawled Private Caswell Moore . He was watching for a signal to come from Private Richard Whiting if troops were seen on either pike . Private Moore had  | discovered that music on duty would keep him alert , and he was singing : " For seven long years , I courted Nellie ? Oh-ho , and the rolling river I courted her with all my riches . We 're bound for the wild Missou-ri . " " What 's Dick doing , Cas ? " Corporal Blount asked . " He 's climbed that elm tree , " Private Moore replied . " Sitting in the forks . " He resumed singing : " She would not have me for her lover ? Oh-ho , and the rolling river Because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild Missou-ri . " Arc you fixing to sing that song clear through to the end ? " demanded Private Miller . " How are your tibia and fibia ? " taunted Moore . " Learn your bones , my boy , and leave music to your betters . " He proceeded with his song : " And so she moved to Kansas City Oh-ho , and the rolling river And from her since , I 've had one message  - -  We 're bound for the wild Missou-ri . " It said she had a nigger baby , Oh-ho , and the rolling river . She must have had another lover , We 're bound ? " " All right , " broke in Corporal Blount . " Time to spell Dick , songbird . Move out . "  | Private Moore signaled to the man in the tree , five hundred yards away , and set out up the hill . Private Miller put his book in his saddle-bags and took up watch from the spot where Moore had lain . Private Renshaw Blount and Private Percy Jones drew their thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hubbard Springs and dismounted . White women and children were plentiful about the streets of the little town , and so were negroes . But white men were scarce . Only very old men could be seen . The postmaster , a bewhiskered ancient , sat on the front porch . " Any news through from Nashville yet ? " asked Private Blount . " Not a word , " replied the postmaster . " Yankees still got the telegraph wires down , I reckon . Word did come , I believe , that Abe Lincoln put that Amendment through . " " Put it through , hey ? " repeated Private Blount . " I 'm not surprised . " Private Jones observed , " That means old Abe 's got his back to the wall . " " He has that , " agreed the postmaster . " If the danged old bastard were n't licked , he 'd never put the Amendment up , in the first place . " The two soldiers sat down on the porch . A woman came from inside the building with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pickin 's sort of slim today , ai n't they ? " asked the postmaster , jerking his thumb toward the empty saddlebags on the horses . Private Renshaw Blount laughed . " This country , " he said , " has been picked clean as a hound 's tooth . " The postmaster clucked his tongue . " Trouble with you soldiers , " he suggested , " you ai n't religious enough . Now , you take the preachers . They are mighty religious . And fat , too . I reckon the preachers git plenty to eat , one way or another . " Blount and Jones exchanged meaningful glances , but said nothing . " Now , o ' cou'se , " continued the postmaster , " these young preachers that went away to war , maybe they do n't eat so good . But I reckon that 's on account of they do a heap of fightin ' and not much prayin ' . But you take some of these oldsters , now , I reckon they set back and pray , and the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voss . Him and a grown daughter and her husband and her husband 's brother  --  I reckon the old man does enough prayin ' for the whole shebang . " " Where are they ? " asked Jones . " Well , now , " said the postmaster , " I do n't know exactly . Since the Conscript Act passed I ai n't seen much of the outfit . I reckon they backed up in the hills somewheres . Maybe in that old log shack about two miles down the pike , and a quarter back in the bushes . But I would n't know , exactly . " The arrival of Paul always was a big event at The  | Cedars . A field hand first saw Richard 's personal servant galloping over a hill , and set up the cry , " Yonder come Paul ! " Margaret , who rode the fields , immediately set out for the house , but the news , traveling by word of mouth from one slave to another , arrived before she did . " Yonder come Paul ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the house . Ophelia , who was fussing at Jenny about the way to dress the babies , immediately forgot what she was saying , and ran through the house , shouting , " Oh , Demetra , Paul is coming ! Paul is coming ! " And the mistress , who was always so quiet and impersonal about everything since the master went away to the wars , jumped up , clapped her hands like a child , and ran to the yard gate . " Ev'body safe and sound , " Paul announced as he swung out of the saddle . " Mos ' Walker done been promoted a big corp'ral , and he got Mos ' Dick and Mos ' Shaw in his command , outpostin ' up above Nashville . I cut out wid de news , quick as dey rid off . I got to jine de command again , when de Gineral rides through Whitley . " " Are they coming through this way , Paul ? " Demetra asked , excitedly . Paul chuckled . " Gineral Forrest , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't on his way to Memphis , right now , I bet he 's on his way to Chattanooga . Or maybe Louisville . " " Oh , " said Demetra , disappointed , " then you do n't really know . "  | " I know he 's travelin ' , " Paul maintained . " I reckon he de onliest man which know whar he travelin ' to . And he liable to change his mind before he git dar , and travel somewhars else again . But he sho ' travelin ' , Miss . " Ophelia managed to get in a word . " Tell me something about Master Walker , " she urged . " What did he do to get promoted , and  --  tell me all about it . " Paul grew solemn . " Hit war like dis , Miss , " he explained . " Gineral Forrest rid up to Mos ' Walker , and pulled out his swo 'd and saluted . Private Walker Blount , ' de Gineral say , dat fightin ' brother-in-law and dat fightin ' brother er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to do somethin ' about hit . Private Dick Whiting and Private Shaw Blount is killin ' off de Yankees so fast dat fust thing I know , hit wo n't be no Yankees left to fight . So I 'm fixin ' to app'int you a big corp'ral in my command , and all you got to do is hold dem boys back . " The women laughed . It was the first time they had laughed in months . With their men off in the army , the Blount plantation confiscated by the Yankee government and the Blount negroes freed by the Louisiana military rulers , and most of the Whiting fortune in slaves who might be freed at any time , there had been very little to laugh at . " Unsaddle your horse , Paul , " Demetra directed , " and get some rest . I 'll talk to you after supper . " Paul caught the reins close to the bridle and started  | off toward the barn . " Miss ' Metra , " he said , " de Yankees passed de slave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the negro . " Paul , " she said , steadily , " that makes you a free man . " " Yes 'm , " said Paul . " Mos ' Dick told me de same . But I 'm too busy fightin ' in de war , jest now , to put much stock in dat kind of talk . " He led the horse off a few steps . " And besides , " he added , " nobody axed me how I felt about hit . " The three women returned to the house and sat on the veranda . A large quilt was on the floor on which three children were playing , the oldest not quite three , and the youngest nearly two . A negro girl was watching them . " Well , anyway , " said Margaret , with a shrug , " these will have to be our menfolks until the General rides through Whitley . " " Or Chattanooga , or Louisville , or some other place , " added Ophelia , lightly , " unless my husband allows Shaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war . " Demetra was grave . The arrival of her husband 's man had stirred her deeply . In her mind , she went over a number of things that had never been openly discussed . The proclamation had made paupers of Shaw and Walker when their slaves were freed and their plantations confiscated , and one could not discuss such matters with one 's sister and sister-in-law . Besides , Richard had had enough to give them a good start ,  | until now . This Amendment had freed his slaves , also , and perhaps confiscation would come next . " My dears , " she said , " I propose we drink to Corporal Walker Blount . " Joseph Goodner crouched behind the stump and waited . He had waited so long in that position that his legs were cramping . But he made no effort to move . " They 're gone , Joe , " Wash called . " Are you certain ? " Joseph asked , without moving . " Dead certain , " affirmed Wash . " How many did you count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but there must have been ? " " Never mind , " snapped Joseph , as he stood up . He stretched first one leg , and then the other . " Come on , " he called to his brother , and he walked off toward the house . Wash shinned down a small dogwood , in the branches of which he had been hiding , and fell in file behind Joseph . Neither spoke until they got to the house . As they reached the little clearing that surrounded the old log house , the battened door swung open and a young woman with a baby in her arms put her head out . " Careful , Joseph , " she warned . " They went away , but they might come back . " " How many were here ? " Joseph asked . " Two , " the woman told him . " Just boys . "  | Joseph and Wash had reached the house by now . " Did they find it ? " Joseph asked . " No , but they took all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat , " corrected the woman 's father , from inside the house . " Two hams from the smokehouse and some things from the kitchen . They did n't go into the loft , thank God . " Joseph sat down in a chair . " This is getting worse and worse , " he said . " I 'll tell you what , Brother Voss , if they do n't get out of this part of the country , I am going to take Annie and the baby and cut out . I wo n't stand this being hunted and robbed ? " " Now , Joseph , " soothed the woman , " do n't get discouraged . " " But where to , my boy ? " the old preacher asked . " The whole country is just like this . " " West , " declared Joseph . " I 'll take Annie and the baby " " You could n't , " objected Brother Voss . " You would have to pass through West Tennessee and Arkansas before you got out of reach of troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , you would be worse off . No , Joseph , you must be patient . " " We could , " suggested Wash , " leave Annie and the baby here until we got " " Shut up , Wash , " Joseph ordered . " Brother Voss is right . I 've got to be patient . " They were silent for some time . " I just wonder , "  | asked Annie , after a while , " who put the rebs onto our trail , down here in this old shack ? " " Yes , " seconded Joseph . " I wonder who ? Wash , have you ? " " I have n't stirred off the place or seen a soul , " Wash denied . " I hate to think it , " suggested Brother Voss , " but I called on a member of my church who was sick , the other day . " " That 's it , " declared Joseph . " Because a person is a member of a church is no sign he is n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautioned the preacher . " Let 's drop that ; my presence here , at least , is known . " " And so is Joseph 's and Wash 's , " added Annie . " The young soldier asked me where my husband was and ? " " What did you say ? " demanded Joseph . " I told him you were in the army  --  with Morgan . He was with Forrest . And he said he did n't believe it , and furthermore , that he believed you had a brother and both of you were hiding out , near the house . I told him you and Wash both were with Morgan . " Joseph chuckled . " I declare , Annie , " he said , " you are getting to be as big a liar as Wash . " " I was n't lying , " snapped Annie . " I was protecting you . And my baby . I do n't want a daughter of mine to face the world , knowing that her father was backed against a wall and shot like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Brother Voss reproved . " It 's the truth ! " she cried . " I 've got my daughter 's interests ? " " So have I , " put in Joseph . " And yours , too . I thought you understood . " " I understand nothing of the kind , " Annie interrupted . " Then , " said Joseph , evenly , " I 'll explain so you will understand . I have responsibilities . " " Other men have responsibilities , too . " Joseph ignored the statement . " And I intend to meet those responsibilities . If I join up in the army , I needlessly put heavy odds against my life . If I stay out of the army , I stand a good chance of living until I have done what I have promised to do . " I promised Ma I 'd look after Wash . I promised your Pa I 'd take care of you . And I promised God that if I should ever have a child , that child would have a decent , respectable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is buried in some ditch with a musket ball through his head ca n't possibly have the home , the schooling , the clothing , and the other things I aim for my child to have . Nor do I want my widow struggling in poverty until she finally dies in distress and in the contempt of her neighbors . And I do n't aim to get shot , so she will have to do it . My mother went through that , Annie , and she suffered like no human being should have to suffer . You 'll never have to do it . " He turned suddenly from his wife to his father-in-law . " It is my purpose ,  | Brother Voss , " he declared , " to keep alive until this war stops . Then I shall take what money I have hid away and set myself , my wife , and my brother  --  and you , if you will come  --  in some locality where we can live decently and respectably . Is that clear ? " " Very clear , Joseph , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm going to do it , " Joseph interrupted . " I 'll spare myself . " " Hmm ! " said the preacher . " I believe you will . " Joseph turned back to his wife . " I am sorry I spoke crossly to you , Annie , " he said , gently . " I am ? " " Yonder they come again ! " shouted Wash from the window . " Swarms of them . Why the whole road for miles and miles " Joseph leaped to the window , shoving his brother aside . He saw five horsemen on the pike , a quarter of a mile away . As he watched they turned into the lane that led to the house and divided , three going to the right , one to the left , and the fifth coming straight down the lane , at a full gallop . Joseph kissed his wife and baby hurriedly . " Come on , Wash , " he said . " Out the kitchen . " He yanked open the back door and stopped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he knew he could not reach it before the raiders saw him . He shut the door again . " Up in the loft , Wash , " he ordered , and the two brothers scurried up the log wall into the attic of the old house .  | The loft was ceiled , from below , but no floor had been lain across the strong , hewn joists . " Lie flat on a timber , " cautioned Joseph . " If you get on the ceiling , it might fall through . Quiet , now . " Wash settled himself in the far corner , and Joseph took up his position at the hole through which he came . pulled his old horse pistol from his waistband , felt to make certain that the cap was in place , and waited . Time dragged . A minute  --  five minutes . Nothing happened . The soldier would have had time to gallop down the lane to the house , Joseph knew . Perhaps , he thought , he was waiting for the others to get placed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he thought . He heard the floor below creak , and presently he could see his wife moving toward the door . He wanted to warn her not to open the door , but he dared not make a sound . Then he heard the door creak on its hinges , and saw Annie step out of the house . In a minute she came back in . " They 've run off , " she said . " All five of them , riding hard toward the woods . " 75  | Chapter Seven WHEN NEWS OF THE SURRENDER CAME IT WAS NOT A SURPRISE TO JOSEPH . FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS IT had been apparent to him which way the war eventually would be decided , and although troops continued to swarm through the vicinity of his hiding-place , they were so much on the move that they had little time for raiding . Joseph became less and less secretive in his living . When Annie 's second baby , a boy , was three weeks old , he decided it would be safe to take both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voss christen them according to the rites of his religion . The girl was called Parthenia Annabel , and the boy was named Andrew Joseph . The ceremony was held late one afternoon . Annie stood with the baby in her arms ; Joseph stood at her right , holding the girl . Wash was at Annie 's left , and although he had no part in the ritual , he was deeply moved by it . " I baptize thee in the name of ? " Brother Voss droned.  | " Praise the Lord , " interrupted Wash . " Amen . " " Dry up , Wash , " ordered Joseph . " Go ahead , Brother Voss . " Lee 's downfall at Appomattox was received with tight-lipped silence . A week later , Wash came in with the news that Johnson had surrendered in South Carolina and that all the lesser commands were grounding their arms and breaking up without formality of surrender . " God be praised , " said Brother Voss , reverently . " This is the end of a cruel struggle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrected Joseph . " The struggle is just beginning . " " At least , " observed Annie , " we can struggle in the open . I 'm so tired of living miles away from nowhere , and not knowing what minute the soldiers will raid ? " Joseph took his wife 's hand and held it . " It has been hard on you , " he told her . " But you are right ; there will be purpose to our struggle from now on . " Annie glowed . Joseph seldom was demonstrative in his affection for her . She moved closer to him , hoping he would impulsively take her in his arms and kiss her . But he did not . Instead , he went to the well and drew a pail of water . " Hand me a wad of cotton , Annie , " he instructed . " And , Wash , you get the auger . " Joseph sat on the floor , close to the wall . He soaked the cotton in the water and began to dampen the white-II  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spot , nearly two inches in diameter , appeared through the water-soaked whitewash . " Bore that plug out , Wash , " he ordered , indicating the spot . " And , Annie , you bring a shot-sack and a knitting-needle . " He went on scouring the log and locating more plugs . As soon as Wash had bored through the plug , Joseph told his wife to probe the hole with the knitting-needle . " Gold pieces ! " exclaimed Annie . " Why , Joseph , I did n't know " " Ought to be ten in there , " he said . " Ten in each hole in this log . Here 's another plug , Wash . " Joseph wet the whitewash , and his brother followed him about with the auger , reaming out the holes that Joseph had bored years before , filled with gold pieces , plugged with wooden pegs , and whitewashed over the whole surface to conceal them . Annie probed each hole with the knitting-needle and raked the gold pieces into the shot-sack . When the job was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A right good poke , " he commented , proudly . " If the war had n't come on when it did , I 'd have had twice that much in another year . I had a good trade with Judge Jones , running his place on the share basis , and trading in horses on the side . " " Oh , Joseph ! " Annie was almost crying . Timidly she went to him and put her arm around his waist . " I 'm very busy , Annie , " he told her , gruffly . " Wash ,  | you 'll make a corn crop in that cleared field while I 'm gone " Gone ? " Annie repeated . " Gone where ? " " Prospecting , " said Joseph . " Hunting a place for us to settle . " " Do we have to leave this part of the country ? " " Yes , " said Joseph . " You know that as well as I do . " Annie was disappointed , but she said nothing . " Wash , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I 'll get you a mule and plow and some seed corn . " He turned to his father-in-law . " Brother Voss , " he said , " I am leaving Annie and the children in your care while I 'm away . I do n't know when I 'll be back , but when I do get back I 'll have a place , somewhere . And look after Wash , too . I promised Ma I 'd take care of him ; he 'll be all right if you are stern with him . " He hefted the sack of gold and studied it for a moment . " Come on , Wash , " he said , abruptly . He moved toward the door a step . Suddenly he turned and caught his wife in his arms and kissed her hungrily . " I love you , Annie , " he blurted . As suddenly as he had seized her he pushed her from him and walked out the door . When he was in the yard he turned . " I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her . " I 'm going to find a place where we can live decently and respectably , beholden to no man alive . When I find such a place , I 'll come back and get you . Kiss the children for me . Come on , Wash . " Annie watched through tears as her husband went  | down the lane . He walked steadily , with a firm , hard stride ; the step indicated invincibility rather than mere determination . Wash trotted at his heels with a characterless pace . Annie smiled through her tears . " Joseph is a wonderful man , Father , " she said proudly . " He is so strong and yet so shy . And he loves me . He really does love me . " Brother Voss chuckled . " Joseph , " he said , " is a curiosity . " Lafe Potter stopped his mule in front of the shabby little log hut , and helped his wife to slide to the ground . Then he dismounted . " Air you tired out , honey ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mule , Lafe , " she replied , " is better'n ridin ' in a chariot of gold with anybody else . " It was the first words they had spoken since they had stood , three hours previously , before Squire Whiting at The Cedars , and responded , " I do , " to the marriage ceremony . And those brief words were the only ones that passed their lips since daylight that morning , when Lafe had whistled to her , down at the Pillow homestead , nine miles away . " It 's me , honey  --  Lafe , " he had whispered . " I come to git you . " " Wait 'll I git my bonnet , " the girl called , softly . They had mounted the mule and ridden to the justice of the peace , and from there Lafe took his bride to his own little home , near South Fork .  | " I 'm mighty proud to git you , " Lafe told her . " God , Mersery , I loved you for four years .

" They went inside the cabin . It had been built by Lafe before he went away to the war , and it had not been completed . Odd times , when he could " run off " from the army , or when he was furloughed during spells of inactivity , he had worked on it . Now , back home for nearly a month , he had built a rustic bed , made a shuck mattress , and added stolen army blankets . He had procured some cooking-pots and had built two chairs " I meant to do a heap of other things about the place afore I come and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't wait no longer . " Mersery squeezed his hand . " I 'm glad ye did n't wait , Lafe , " she told him . Lafe led his bride to the bed and they both sat down . Mersery was shy , and Lafe was self-conscious . " Tell me , " he urged , " about some of the things you thought about me when I was off at the wars . " " I could n't tell you , hardly , " Mersery said . " I 'd jest git to thinkin ' about you , and all at once it would be like I was playin ' barefoot , down at the creek , and was  | gittin ' bogged down in the quicksand . I 'd jest sort of melt away . And I 'd call for you to come and git me out of the sand . But you would n't come . So I 'd jest keep on sinkin ' , and first thing you knowed I 'd be skeered and chokin ' . I reckon I was chokin ' on love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes I 'd git sick and puke . " " Would you , honey ? " Lafe lay back on the bed , and pulled her with him . " I reckon that was some love . I love you like ? " " Yi ! Lafe Potter ! " The voice roared from in front of the cabin . Lafe and Mersery leaped to their feet simultaneously . " Hit 's Uncle Bulger , " Mersery warned . " He 's come to kill you ! Oh , Lafe , darlin ' , do n't let him . " Lafe grabbed his musket and handed the cartridgepouch to Mersery . " Start chawin ' off them ca'tridges , " he ordered , crisply . " Hell is fixin ' to pop , right here and now . " He spoke hurriedly , but without any show of excitement . " You sprawl down on the floor , there , and chaw them ca'tridges . " Lafe opened the door a crack , and then lay down by the side of his wife . Out of the crack in the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Bulger , the chief of the clan . " What do you want with Lafe Potter ? " he challenged . For answer , Bulger Pillow lifted his pistol and fired through the crack in the door . The bullet sailed three  | feet above the prone bodies of Lafe and Mersery , landing against a log in the opposite wall with a deadened smack . Lafe pulled the trigger on his musket , and set a ball between Bulger Pillow 's eyes . " Quick , honey , " Lafe whispered . " Gim me a chawed ca'tridge . " He reloaded with a practiced rapidity . The shot that killed Bulger Pillow caused confusion , and before the other Pillows could compose themselves and plan what to do next , Lafe had reloaded and fired again . A second man fell from his horse with a gaping hole in his temple . The three remaining men wheeled their horses and started off at a run . Lafe 's musket blazed at them as they wheeled , and another of the Pillow boys died . Lafe reloaded and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifle against the side of the house and took careful aim . The gun roared . " Got him right whar his galluses crossed , " he told Mersery . " That was Homer , " Mersery said . " He allus was mean about you and me . I 'm glad . " The fifth Pillow reached the woods . Lafe leaned the musket against the wall and looked toward the field of slaughter . " I got four of the bastards , " he observed , casually . " I 'm glad , " repeated Mersery . " They 'll never bother me and you again , will they ? "  | " Not them . " Lafe took Mersery 's hand . " Come back to the bed , honey , " he urged . Mersery hesitated . " Had n't we better bury them varmints ? " she asked . " Not now , " said Lafe . " I 'll bury ' em afore sundown . Dead men do n't start stinkin ' for a day or so , anyway . Come on , Mersery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to Phinizy County in the spring of ' 66 . He had been riding for months , hunting for a place to settle his family . He had ridden north as far as the Ohio River , but the farther north he traveled , the less he liked the country . At Louisville he turned west and crossed southern Illinois . In St. Louis , he heard wonderful tales of the Western prairie country , and he rode toward it . But when he reached the Kansas border he decided the prairie country was not for him . He turned south . The Territories and western Arkansas showed nothing that appealed to him . When he struck the Red River , at Shreveport , he put his horse on a steamboat , rode to the Mississippi River , and headed north for Memphis . The moment he saw the Chickasaw bluffs he knew that he would find what he wanted , somewhere near Memphis . " It 's far enough from Pulaski County to be new , " he said , " and close enough to be like home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state , traveled as far east as Jackson , and to Reelfoot Lake to the north . Phinizy County lay most to his liking . The  | country was open , but not overrun with people . It bordered the Mississippi River , which would be a means of transportation to the market in Memphis , but a few miles from the river ran the bluffs , to block off the high water . And back of the bluffs stretched low , undulating hills and rich green bottoms . The tall poplar trees and the huge white oaks appealed to him most . " Land that can grow timber like that , " he said , " is bound to be rich . " The war had disrupted the settled communities , and cleared land could be bought cheaply . The country enjoyed , he decided , most of the advantages of the frontier , and had very few of the inconveniences . Two tracts of land that were offered for sale appealed to him . The Pillow holdings at Key Corner were being divided and sold off . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The place lay within a few miles of the Mississippi River , and that was an advantage . But there were drawbacks , also . The land flooded nearly every spring , and he did not like floods . The Abercrombie place lay twelve miles inland , and the price ran five dollars an acre higher for the cleared land . But the hills were low and rolling , and the place was closer to Whitley , and more of the surrounding country was cleared and built up . He bought three hundred acres around the Abercrombie home place , paying one-third cash . The sale was completed in Whitley , the money paid to Walter Kincaid , as representative , by order of chan-  | cery court , of all the heirs of Tipton Abercrombie , and the deed recorded . " And now , " suggested Walter , jingling the gold that Joseph had counted out to him , " le 's us drap over to Henry Solomon 's and have a drink on the trade . " " Thank you , " said Joseph , " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " From Pulaski County and do n't  --  aw , I see . Well , le 's us step down the hall and meet the county Judge , Squire Whiting . He 's a clever feller , and an aristocrat , too . He 'll be a neighbor er your'n , out there . And he 'll be ' tendin ' to your business , too , if you do n't mind out . " As they walked down the hall neither said a word . Walt thought : " Maybe if you 're too good to drink with me , you 'll drink with him , you damned aristocrat . And maybe he 'll git you drunk and take your place away from you . " Joseph thought : " He called me an aristocrat . That 's a good start in a new country , maybe . I 'll like this country , I believe . I 'll be respectable and I 'll be respected . I wonder if it is dishonest to let him think I am an aristocrat , instead of a slave-driver that was kicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am ? I wonder if a man is called on to go about shouting his shortcomings to the world , if people ca n't find out about them any other way ? " Before Joseph had decided on the point of ethics , they reached the office of the County Court Judge .  | " Judge , " said Walt , " shake hands with Cap 'm Goodner , from Pulaski . He jest bought Dry Hill ? " They shook hands . " I am not a captain , however , " Joseph explained . Richard laughed . " Walt hands out military titles right and left since he got back from the wars . He calls me major , sometimes , but the best I could get out of it was a pair of corporal 's stripes . " " I did n't even get stripes , " Joseph stated . " Well , you should ' a ' had ' em , " put in Walt . " At any rate , " Richard said , " you 've got a fine place at Dry Hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you appear to be . We need a lot of good people in our part of the county . We 're building some county roads and schools down that way , and it 's a tough fight to get the people together on modern ideas . We 've been a little backward  --  big families and clannishness , you know . Tip Abercrombie was a fine man , in a sort of ineffectual way . He held on to his inheritance , paid his debts , and , in a fashion , provided for his family . But when he died , Walt , here , was the only son-in-law worth killing . Walter is a clever boy , but he 's not much of a farmer . For the sake of the rest of the bunch , I 'm sorry Walter sold the land . But our Republican chancellor made him executor of the estate , and Walt has a head of his own . " Walt fidgeted . " I got to look out for me and mine , " he explained . " If the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's their lookout , I reckon . " " I reckon it is , " agreed Richard . " Oh , by the way ,  | Mr. Goodner , will you and Walt have a drink with me ? " He pulled a gallon jug from a wall cabinet . " Do n't mind if I do , " said Walt . " Thanks , I never drink , " said Joseph . " But y'all go right ahead . " Richard and Walt drank , and the latter made an excuse to leave . " Pulaski County , " Richard mused . " I never knew many people up that way . I 'm from Rutherford . I did have a friend in my regiment from Pulaski . Jones ? Percy Jones , son of Judge ? " " Chancellor Archibald Jones , " Joseph supplied . " I knew Percy and his father , both . " Joseph felt uncomfortable . He wondered if , after all , he had come far enough away from Pulaski County to settle his family . " Percy was killed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relief . " Too bad , " he said . " I had n't heard . " " Yes , " Richard said . " Too bad . Percy was a fine boy . " Joseph turned the conversation back to his purchase . He learned of Richard 's plan to build a county road through from Whitley to the mouth of the Obion River . There were plans , too , for a county-supported school in the neighborhood . " Not any chance for any help from the state , " Richard declared . " The Republicans claim Governor Harris ran off with all the public school money . "  | " I believe Governor Harris is an honest man , " declared Joseph , with feeling . " Of course he 's honest , " Richard repeated . " And I hope he made off with that money , too . I 'd a blame sight rather see Isham G. Harris have that money than these scamps who are in office now . " Joseph could not reconcile his idea of honesty with making away with public funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view on the matter . Joseph decided to withhold comment on that point . " I 'm eager for the school , " he told Richard . " I 've got a daughter almost of school age , now , and a son who 'll be ready for school in a few years . " He wondered if the third baby , which had been born while he was prospecting for a home , was a boy or girl . " I 'm glad you feel that way , " Richard told him . " Old Tip Abercrombie was a good , honest soul , all right . But it takes something more than rigid honesty to build up a country . Tip was sorry . Plain sorry . And when he died he left nobody but a flock of daughters . " " Families , " observed Joseph , " have a way of petering out . "  | Chapter Eight V OSEPH RODE THROUGH THE MAIN STREETS OF HUBBARD SPRINGS WITH HIS HEAD HELD HIGH . THE FOUR Maury County mules that he had bought on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased to be any bother to him . The mules , wise in the ways of things , had quickly learned that it was better to trot docilely behind the saddle mare than to experience the sharp pull of the hackamore on their jaws . The street was muddy and a light spring drizzle was falling . Very few people were about . Some of these Joseph knew and recognized . But none of them spoke a word of greeting to him . He had never had many friends in the little town , and he had been snubbed many times . But not to resent it was a new experience . It made him realize that he had risen above something ; that he was a bigger man , now , than he had been , that perhaps his ambition was , if not achieved , at least in process of being realized . " I am beholden to no man , " he thought , with pride . He stopped at a hardware store and bought two farm-  | ing-wagons and harness for the mules . He made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every move . He had one of the wagons lashed to the rear of the other , one pair of mules hitched to the front wagon , and the other mules and his saddle mare tethered to the rear of the caravan . He paid cash in gold . The merchant asked no questions , and Joseph volunteered no information . The rain was falling in earnest when he turned off the pike into the lane which led to the log cabin where he had left his little family a year before . He noticed that one of the fields by the side of the lane had been plowed and dragged , indicating to him that corn had been planted . " Wash , " he observed , " must be getting ambitious . " He drove up to the house , and called , " Hello ! " The door opened and Annie looked out . " Joseph ! " she cried , and ran to the wagon . Joseph leaped to the ground and caught his wife . " I 'm glad to see you , girl ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagerly . " My , I 'm glad to see you ! " Wash appeared at the door , let out a yelp , and came running . Behind him , screaming , came Parthenia Annabel , age four , and Andrew Joseph , just turning three . Brother Voss followed the children . And behind Brother Voss came a young woman with a baby in her arms . When the others came up , Joseph lost his emotional warmth . He turned Annie loose and stepped back . Ll  | Everybody was talking at once , and the confusion of it all embarrassed him . " And this is the baby ! " exclaimed Annie , proudly , taking the child from the other woman . " Is n't he wonderful , Joseph ? Look ! Take him in your arms . " " Let 's get inside , " Joseph said , curtly , " before we all catch pneumonia . Wash , unhook the mules and rub the mare down . Come on in . " " Now first , " Joseph said , " let 's have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name , " Annie said . " He 'll be seven months old on the ninth . Oh , Joseph , I missed you so much ? " Joseph reached for the baby and held it clumsily in his arms . " Fine looking youngster you are , " he told the child . " Look a heap like your mother . " " He has your eyes and forehead , " Annie pointed out . He handed the infant to his wife . " Now , how 's everybody ? And  --  by the way , who is this ? " " Oh , " said Annie . " I forgot , in the excitement . That 's Luella . Wash 's wife . They got married Christmas ? " " Wash 's wife ? " repeated Joseph . " You mean , Wash got married ? " The idea seemed ridiculous to him and he laughed . " Who in the thunder would want to marry Wash ? " He thought it was the funniest thing that ever happened , and he laughed louder than anybody in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry him , Joe Goodner , " Luella  | snapped , " and I do n't see the joke of it . Wash is the most wonderful man I ever knew . " Joseph stopped laughing and grew serious . " That 's the spirit , " he told her . " Wash always was such an irresponsible boy , it just seemed funny that he should grow up and marry . " Annie was aglow with pride and love , that rainy afternoon . Never before had her husband maintained such care-free good humor . First Joseph had to get out of his wet clothes . Annie went with him to the bedroom while he changed . " I 'm so hungry to see you , " she told him . " I do n't want you out of my sight a minute . Now , tell me all about everything . " " In due time , " Joseph told her . " Everything will be to your liking , I believe . But first , I want to hear what has been going on while I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wash had made a crop , the year before , and the corn had brought a good price . There had been plenty to eat for everybody , and clothes to wear , thanks to the money that Joseph had left with Brother Voss . When the crop was sold , Wash decided he wanted to get married , and he " set out " for Luella . " He started courting her in November , " Annie explained , " and they got married Christmas day . Pa performed the ceremony in the church . They hired a new preacher , you know . Some of the folks got some things into their heads against Pa ? "  | " I know , " Joseph said . " It 's too bad they feel that way , too . It is their loss . " " Luella 's folks were ugly about it , too , " went on Annie , " but we just ignored them before they got the chance to ignore us . " Joseph laughed at that . " That was smart , " he admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks ? " " Jones , " Annie told him . " Do n't you remember little Luella Jones ? Used to ride up and down the streets at a dead run ? " " Alec Jones ' daughter ? " demanded Joseph . " Well , I 'll declare ! Wash blamed near hit the ceiling , did n't he ? I drove slaves for her uncle . " " Well , " Annie explained , " do n't think the Jones family is n't fuming about it . They fussed and carried on for some time , and then they publicly disowned her . " Annie laughed gayly . " The funny part of that is , the Jones family is dead broke , too proud to go to work , and are slowly starving to death . And Luella has n't been cold or hungry for a minute since she married Wash . Of course , it is n't what she 's been accustomed to , but it 's better than what she would get , living at home with her folks . " " Looks like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Luella married Wash instead of Wash marrying her . " They went into the room where the entire family had assembled , and Joseph gave them a long , careful account of his wanderings , and finally a detailed description of the home he had bought . The recital lasted all  | afternoon , and during supper , when Joseph hesitated , a question would be asked and he would be off again for half an hour . " Now , " he said , " let 's have an understanding . " He stood up and faced his listeners . " Let 's understand each other , and let 's understand ourselves . " He paused . The rain beat heavily on the thick cedar boards of the roof . " First , we are not running away from this country . We are decent , honest people , and we have nothing in our hearts to be ashamed of . " " That 's the truth , before God , " said Brother Voss . Joseph ignored the preacher . " Each of us here , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luella  --  has reasons for wanting to get into a new country and make a new start . " The statement was met with solemn attention . " Let 's be honest , " Joseph urged . " I believe in honesty . I want to leave , mainly , because when I was growing up I was not good enough to associate with the socalled best people . That fact rankled my soul , although I was in no way to blame for that condition . My father was unfortunate enough to be the kind of man who did not command the respect of his fellow men , and I grew up a poor boy . It was these two facts upon which I was judged and found inferior ; my personal character and my manners , both of which , to my way of thinking , were superior to those of many people I could name but with whom I could not associate , had noth-  | ing to do with my being an outcast among that class of people . " To add further to my complete degradation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I drove slaves for a gentleman . I did it because the work was lucrative and I had the ability to do it . I am not ashamed of that work . It was honest work , and I did it well . " Then came the war . At the outset it appeared to me to be a foolish , rash war , pointless and unnecessary . I had a wife and a young brother to care for , and we expected to have a baby soon . I declined to be swayed by passion ; I examined the issues with such reason as God gave me . I found that I was not interested in the outcome of such a fight . " His voice had taken on such deadly , irrefutable tones that no one thought of agreeing or disagreeing with him . They sat still and silent . " The Conscript Act was passed . I still could see no reason for shooting and being shot at . I became a refugee from the law . And in doing so I made my wife and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are of importance to the people in the community . But they are not important enough to be spread across the state to our new home . " Joseph paused again , wet his lips , and looked about him . The little group were still looking at him expectantly . He took a breath , and went on . " That accounts for our wanting to leave . "  | He paused again . " Wash , of course , is in the same boat as I. " He looked at Wash 's wife . " And Luella , " he went on , " wants to leave ? " " Hold on , Joe , " Luella interrupted . " Let me do my own talking . " Wash ducked his head as though he expected the roof to fall in on him . Annie trembled as if she feared a bolt of lightning would strike Luella for interrupting Joseph when he was talking so seriously . As for Joseph , he had his mouth open when the interruption came and he forgot to close it . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he bowed , yielding the floor to his sister-in-law . But instead of making a speech , Luella crossed the room , put her arms around her husband 's neck , and kissed him on the forehead . " I love you , darling , " she said , loud enough for everybody in the room to hear . Wash pulled her to him and kissed her on the mouth . " Honey , " he told her , " you said more in two seconds than Joe got off his chest in the last two hours . " Annie bristled . Brother Voss drew out his handkerchief and snorted into it , probably to conceal laughter . Joseph took Annie 's hand . " I am sorry I am not given to public demonstrations , Annie , " he told her . " Let 's get to bed . " The Commandant was sweating from the intense heat of the New Orleans May weather and from the  | weight of the decision he had been called upon to make . His heavily braided military coat hung on a peg by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they reflected like mirrors , were in the corner . On the table before him his military cap supported the crossed cannons of the artillery , but the heavy saber which he wore strapped to his waist was of the cavalry design . His undershirt , opened at the neck , revealed a broad , almost hairless brown chest . His face and neck were shades darker than his chest , and his hair was oiled and brushed down . He looked more like an Indian than a negro . His long slim fingers toyed with the papers in front of him , and when he spoke his voice was soft and well modulated . " Gentlemen , " he said , " this is serious . Very serious business . " The two white men sitting across the table from him wore well-cut cotton-crash mufti . By contrast they appeared perfectly comfortable in spite of the heat , and apparently were not in the least concerned over the matter before them . " That is our offer , " stated Dr. Miller . The Commandant looked carefully through the papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he had caused the files in the prison office to be searched thoroughly to make certain there was no other record on the cases . " Their offenses , " he stated , " could not be considered entirely military . The attempt to run  | the blockade past Fort St. Philip might come under that heading . But what about abduction ? One hundred and eighty-six cases of abduction . That is serious . They practically kidnapped nearly two hundred freedmen and were on their way to Brazil when they were overhauled and arrested . " The mulatto frowned . " That seems more political than military . Do you think the Government spent millions of dollars and lost thousands of men to free these people , only to have them abducted , hauled off to Brazil , and enslaved again ? " " Our offer , " said Richard Whiting , " is three thousand dollars in greenbacks if the three prisoners are liberated and put aboard the steamboat Richardson before it pulls out in the morning . " The Commandant appeared not to hear . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on . " There is no telling what the ramifications may be . " " Perhaps , Doctor , " Richard addressed his companion , " the matter is too important for the Major Commandant to handle . Shall we go to see the General ? " " I can handle it , all right , " the Commandant assured him , quickly . " The point I meant to bring out was this : for the risk involved in so gigantic a matter , do n't you think the consideration is too small ? " The two white men stood as if by signal . " Thank you , Major , " said Dr. Miller . " We came to you first because we hoped to be able to get direct results . However , we shall have to see the General , after all . " The Major stood and smiled . " Three thousand dol-  | lars in greenbacks , " he agreed . " Your friends will be on board when the Richardson pulls out . " " When our friends are put on board , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars into your hands . " Richard and Dr. Miller shook hands with the Commandant , and started to leave . " You know , gentlemen , " the Commandant told them , smiling , " I have been bought and sold several times , in my life . This will be the first time I shall have the pleasure of handling the money . " The white men laughed with the Commandant . " You certainly are entitled to it , " said Richard , heartily . " And I hope you are able to sell yourself many more times . " " By the way , " called the Commandant , as they walked out the door . " What is your hotel ? " " The St. Louis , " said Richard . " Your friends , " said the Major , " will meet you there in half an hour . " As soon as the men left , the negro Commandant called for his orderly . " Bring in Caswell Moore , Walker Blount , and Renshaw Blount , " he instructed .  | Chapter Nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE Richardson 's STERNWHEEL CHURNED the muddy water day and night , but the down-rush of the current bore the boat backward almost as rapidly as the wheel pushed it upstream . The five young men who had come aboard only a half-hour before it pulled out from Canal Street had plenty of time to discuss their future plans . But they had nothing to say to the other passengers , and very little to say amongst themselves . Richard paced the deck nervously and impatiently . Dr. Miller read the medical books he had bought at New Orleans , but , finding these tiring , he would lay them aside and walk the deck with Richard . The two Blounts and Caswell Moore sat in chairs and watched the river slip by . " After seven months in that stinking jail , " Caswell said , " this seems pretty good . Eh , Walker ? " " Suits me until something better turns up , " agreed Walker . " How about you , Shaw ? "  | " I only make complaints in writing , " stated Renshaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , today . " When they approached Lake Providence , where the Blount plantations had been , Dr. Miller suggested they go to the texas and have a look about the country . Walker shook his head sadly . " I 've already seen that part of the country . " " You can call me , " said Caswell , " when you see Memphis . " " Me , too , " put in Renshaw . " By the way , Dick , did you send that telegraph message to the girls ? " " Whoever heard of sending telegraph messages to the backwoods ? " Cas Moore interrupted . " I sent it , all right , " Richard cut in , " and you can bet your last dollar they 'll get it , and be on the bank when the boat lands . " " Come , come now , " chided Dr. Miller . " You do n't expect us to believe you 've got telegraph wires to that wonderful haven you 've been telling us about . " " Not directly to my home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line that runs through the county seat . And three hours on horseback ? " " Man , do n't say horseback to me , " protested Caswell . " I never was so tired of anything as riding horseback . " " Pardon , sir , " a stranger in civilian clothes interrupted . " Did I hear you mention horses , sir ? My name is " Not me , " Cas Moore denied , innocently . " I was just  | singing a little song we used to sing when I was a boy . It goes like this : " ' Maury mules and Morgan horses , Place your bets and count your losses . Wheel your partners , cut your capers Balance all and ? ' " " I beg your pardon , sir , " the man said , stiffly , and walked away . It was not until the boat landed at Memphis and the entire party was settled in the suite at the Gayoso which Demetra had engaged beforehand , that they hazarded any discussion of their affairs . Demetra , Margaret , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jolly and tender homecoming for the two Blount brothers . And because no one was present to greet Caswell , Demetra undertook to supply the welcome . " And so this is Cas Moore ! " she exclaimed . " I 've heard how you rampaged about the country , singing ? " " The pleasure , " Cas told her , solemnly , " is mine . Shall I sing for you ? " " Please do , " said Demetra , but a chorus of four male voices roaring " No ! " shouted her down . The gayety continued until they were inside the hotel suite . " Now , " said Margaret , " I want to hear every detail of it , Shaw . " " There is n't much to tell about a venture that fails , "  | Renshaw said . " We chartered a Dutch freighter  --  our agent thought it best to get a Dutch boat  --  and we inveigled , one way or another , nearly two hundred husky black men and women on board , and pulled out for Rio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sealed and signed . " But the Yankees had left some sort of detachment at the mouth of the river , and as we started through the Passes they threw a shot across our bow . The Dutchman headed for the bank . We were arrested and brought back to New Orleans in irons . Whatever became of the ship or the cargo I never heard . But after we had lain in jail a month or more , the agent came to see us and we got him to telegraph . " And that , ladies and gentlemen , " Renshaw added , with a flourish , " is a brief story of the Brazilian venture that was conceived in Pulaski County , gestated on horseback , and delivered abortively in a stinking nigger jail in New Orleans . " " And we are going to live happily ever after , " said Margaret quietly . " It would have been exciting , " Ophelia said , regretfully . " New country , no Yankees , no politics . Just your man at tlr house and your negroes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doing things unmolested by busybodies ? " " And your children growing up , " put in Demetra , " like young hyenas , without manners or education . "  | " It 's best , as it is , " decided Dr. Miller . " It was a bold , rash prank . " " It was a bid for adventure , " declared Caswell . " Who knows but what I might have met a beautiful native girl ? " " And had a nigger baby , " broke in Walker , " like your lady in Kansas City . " " What ? " demanded Demetra . " Just a song , my dear , " laughed Richard . " He sings of an unrequited love ? " " And it cost , " Renshaw finished , " a little over fortysix thousand dollars , greenback . " Silence followed Renshaw 's statement . In their minds the men were calculating . The women were amazed . " I would like to know , " Ophelia said , " where this money came from , Walker ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margaret , with spirit . " I never was very much in favor of living in Brazil , in the first place . And suddenly I find that my husband has been spending a fortune on the thing , and my own brother is a party to it . " Demetra said nothing , but she looked accusingly at her husband . Richard looked out of the window to avoid her eyes . The silence was heavy for several minutes . It was Caswell who spoke first . " I see no reason why these ladies should n't know about it , " he said . " After all , there is nothing to conceal now . What we did was punishable by death , at the time it was done , but the au-  | thorities that would have shot us no longer exist . And " " It would be advisable , " Dr. Miller observed , " not to have the federal government learn about it , even now . " " These beautiful young ladies , " said Cas , " do n't look to me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of information , especially if I ask them not to . So , there being no objections , gentlemen " ? he bowed to the men ? " I shall tell them what I would already have told my wife , if I had a wife . " " If it is something we should n't know , " said Margaret , " perhaps " " You may as well know it , " put in Richard . " No harm can come of it , now . " " We looted a Yankee paymaster , " Cas said , suddenly . " Oh ! " exclaimed Margaret . " I thought you had done something disgraceful , the way you all talked about getting shot for it . " " No , " denied Caswell , " it was just a routine affair . " Shaw , here , and Percy Jones  --  he died at Cumberland Gap , poor boy  --  had been out foraging . Shaw was about the most thorough forager in our little outpost . Walker was always sitting back , being a corporal all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war and you , IVY Whiting . And Miller was studying his books about bones . Percy was a little too delicate to be really good at foraging , and as for me , my saddle had worn so many corns on my posterior  --  is n't that the  | term , Doc ? ? that I stayed on the ground as much as I could . " Well , anyway , Shaw and Percy came into camp with a pair of hams and some other provender , which I thought was wonderful . But they also brought news that the supplies had come from some out-of-the-way cabin where an old preacher and his daughter lived and where two scalawags were supposed to be in hiding . " Walker , being the corporal in command of the outpost , conceived it to be his duty to arrest those scalawags . " We found the house , and separated to surround it , but while we were riding , Shaw spotted a Yankee soldier at the edge of the woods . Shaw yelled , and we all tore out after that Yankee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was riding point on a supply-train that was trying to cross from one pike to the other . And when he heard us coming , he broke for his advance guard , yelling at the top of his voice that General Forrest and the whole rebel army was after him . The advance guard turned with him and stampeded the main body , and there was the worst mix-up you ever saw . " The upshot of it all was , among the wagons that had been overturned or left hanging to a tree by a wheel we found a sack with two hundred and twentyfive thousand dollars in brand-new greenbacks in it . " We took the money back to our camp , buried it , and  | lit out for our main body with the information that the Yankees were in that neighborhood . " " Which , " added Walker , " was exactly what my orders called for . " " Splendid ! " exclaimed Demetra . " I think all of you were very brave . " " Five men , " insisted Margaret , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army , " explained Renshaw . " I reckon there were only about a hundred or so . " " Hmm ! " said Margaret , sarcastically , " that sounds more reasonable . Only about twenty to one . " " Yes , " said Cas . " That made it about even . " " I think , " suggested Ophelia , " we had better have another drink . Fighting Yankees is tiring , even if the odds are only twenty to one . " The drinks were poured , the men and women alike taking neat whisky . " There remains , " said Dr. Miller , " something like a hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars of that money , on deposit here in Memphis , to my credit . What shall we do with it ? " " We 'll divide it , " said Cas , without hesitation . " I am through with big concerted actions . I 'd like to take my part and travel about some . I saw nothing but the inside of that jail for so long " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Miller . " While waiting for the Brazil project to develop , I built up a nice little medical practice ? "  | " Then let 's divide it , " said Richard . " Five into a hundred makes twenty , " Margaret calculated , " and into seventy-five is fifteen  --  thirty-five thousand apiece ! Why , Renshaw , that is a heap of money ! " " What about the share of the boy who was killed ? " asked Ophelia . " We agreed on that , " explained Dr. Miller . " If any of us should get killed before the war ended , that share went into the general pool . " " It does n't seem quite right , " Demetra protested . " Perhaps his relatives are in want . So many people are , you know . " " That was considered , too , " said Dr. Miller . " We all agreed that it would be too complicated  --  too hard to explain to anyone else , so it would be understood as we , ourselves , acting under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right this minute , are slow to believe that five men could stampede a strongly escorted supply-train . Yet , that is exactly what we did . It is true that we did n't realize what we were riding against when we took after that one Yankee , but we did n't stop chasing as long as they were running from us. , " We learned that from General Forrest , " said Cas , proudly . " Because the Yankees never could tell how strong he was and they did n't want to find out badly enough to wait and count his soldiers . " After the Doctor and Cas left , the three couples , interrelated by marriage and knit in love by common  | sufferings , sat in a long , sweet silence , enjoying the presence of one another , relaxing from long years of worry and hardship which they had borne jointly and individually . Their enjoyment was above words ; it was so self-evident that none of them thought of trying to demonstrate its reality . Ophelia was the first to move . She got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets and buildings . She was thinking of nothing in particular ; she just watched life streaming by  --  carriages pulled by spans of horses trotting proudly ; carts drawn by mules , poking along ; people moving hurriedly on the shady side of the streets . It was all intriguing and strange to her to watch the bustle of swarming activity . But suddenly the idea of all the people and all of their pointless milling tired her . She walked from the window and sat on the arm of Walker 's chair . " I am so glad , " she said . " About the money , I mean . Richard has been splendid , and Demetra has been the most wonderful sister any woman ever had . But nothing can quite take the place of a husband who is n't dependent on some one else . I 'm glad for you and for me and for all of us . " Walker squeezed Ophelia 's hand gently . He understood , too . And he was glad . Ophelia was speaking to her husband , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the others . They were , however , too occupied with their own thoughts and feelings to notice . What Ophelia had  | said merely fitted into their consciousnesses as a part of the present existence and made it full and complete to them . " I 've been thinking , " Richard stated , after another long silence , " that the Pillow place would be to your liking . " He was speaking to Walker and Renshaw , but his words were directed to the opened window which he happened to be facing . " It is mostly bottom land , and that suits you . It would be good to have you in the neighborhood . " Renshaw consciously heard only one word , and without realizing that he and his brother were the subject of Richard 's musing , he picked up the thought . " The bottoms , " he said , " is the place . Somewhere , with rich level land , rebuilt each year by the river 's overflow . Something that a man can work with , and something that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " The schools are better in Memphis , " said Demetra . She had not actually heard a single word spoken by anyone else . " Our son will soon be big enough to go to school . " " We have such a fine , darling son , " Margaret said . " Let 's have another one right away , Shaw . " " Let 's go to dinner first , " laughed Renshaw . The revery was broken . Everybody laughed . They had heard , as if by some delayed action of the senses , what Margaret had said , only after Renshaw had laughed . " Silly , " said Margaret , blushing.  | Chapter Ten WALTER KINCAID SAT ON THE BACK OF HIS SADDLE W MULE , AND LOOKED ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER . Less than a mile from where he was at that very moment lay the dimly outlined trees of Arkansas . Arkansas ! That was a place for a man with some git-up-andgit , now . There was a lot of new country over there , with timber on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and timber that a man could cut and sell . Walt dismounted , walked around his log-wagon and to the brink of the river 's bank . The bank had been caving along that stretch , since the water went down , and it stood in irregular perpendicular slices . As he approached the edge , a chunk of the black sandy mud disengaged and slipped down the twenty feet to the water , where it struck with a hollow clunk and disappeared . " I 'll bet that river air a hund'ed foot deep , right here , " Walt estimated . " What with the eddy cuttin ' agin the bank and all . " He went back to his team , and climbed on the back of his saddle mule . " Yeah , Dinah ! Spike !  | Git away , babies ! " he called , and the five mules lay against their collars . A mule team in the bottoms was an experiment . Ever since the Blount brothers settled and built a steampowered sawmill , just under the bluffs , they had used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could step into the swampy mire of the cypress brakes and lift their feet out , where a mule would go down , and be held there by the vacuum of the oozy mud against his solid hoof . The oxen were slower than the mules , but much more certain . A series of complications , however , had come about . When the old Abercrombie home place was sold , Walt , husband of the oldest Abercrombie daughter , had , as administrator , received the money . Walt and Mattie , who had been living on Richard 's place , where Walt was the man-of-all-work , moved back on the unsold portion of the Abercrombie place . The business of dividing the unsold land among nine daughters , each of whom had ideas about it , occasioned bickering and wrangling for nearly a year . The division of the money was simple , but the results of the division were not pleasant . The girls to whom the money actually had to be paid wrangled with their husbands and with one another over how to spend it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air gone plum clothes crazy . She 's bought three dresses since Christmas , and now , dang her hide , she wants another one .  | Why , she 'll have more clothes than Mis ' Demetry , if she do n't stop . " " Do n't fuss with Mattie , " Richard advised . " She 's got her hands full taking care of that boy of hers . You come on back and go to work for me , and let things settle down some . " Coming back to work for Richard was not so simple as it seemed . During Walt 's absence , Richard had put Paul , his negro servant , in charge of the place , and Paul was proving a much better man-of-all-work . The question of what Walt could be set to doing so that the situation of a white man working under a negro would not arise , was Richard 's problem . " I 'll tell you , Walt , " Richard decided . " The Blount boys are fixing to cut that white oak on the knolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mule ca n't haul that oak . You wo n't have to get into the brakes after it , and if you 're careful with the team you can do a powerful lot of logging this summer . Of course you 'll have to come out when the rains set in this fall . But I 'll see you before then . You catch those five young mules I got in from Maury County last month , and hook them to that six-inch James &; Graham . Throw a load of feed on , and strike out . " Walt caught the team , but just before he drove out of the lot Richard cautioned him again . " Be careful , " he repeated . " Those mules cost me three hundred dollars apiece , besides the wagon and harness . They 're liable to run away and break their necks in the woods ,  | or they might go crazy and run into the river with you . " " If they run in the river , " Walt promised , " I 'll go in with ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em out with me . " " That 's the spirit , " Richard approved . " Go ahead . Tell Shaw I sent you . " Walt was halfway to the bottoms before it occurred to him why he was being sent away from The Cedars . " Would n't do to let folks find out he had a white man workin ' under a nigger , " he muttered , " but , by God ! he figgers hit 's all right to take a white man 's job away from him and give hit to a nigger . " The thought generated gall in his soul , just as Mattie 's efforts to ape Demetra Whiting in matters of dress had caused bitterness . The fact that his and Mattie 's son , Caleb , showed signs of a weak mind occurred to him now , and added to his general dissatisfaction with life . When he came to Younger 's store on the edge of the bluff , he stopped , put his team in the shade , and went inside . A young woman came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whisky and a dime 's worth of cheese and crackers , " he told her . While the whisky was being drawn from a barrel , Walt studied the woman . He liked her build and the way she stepped . " Mattie never moved with that much ginger in her life , " he thought . " And she 's got some meat on her bones , too . " He paid special attention to  | the firm , rounded hips which had never been confined with corset stays , and to the way her long straight sturdy legs set into her bare feet . " She 's got some gitup-and-git about her , " he decided . The whisky was drawn and the cheese sliced . " I 'll git you a gourd er water , " the girl told him . " Thatere whisky air s'raw hit 'll burn yer guts out . " She brought a cedar pail of water and a gourd . " Let 's see , " Walt speculated . " I do n't b'lieve I know yer name . Mine 's Kincaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mine , " said the woman , " air Jessie Kate Younger . " " I knowed you was a Younger , " Walt told her . " You got Young Bas 's eyes . You his gal ? " " Nope , " the woman told him . " Young Bas was my daddy 's uncle . I 'm Zach 's gal . " " Married ? " The woman laughed . " Not yit , " she said . " Fixin ' to ? " " Not now , " she explained , solemnly . " The man I was fixin ' to marry got kilt in the wars . I 'm still huntin ' about . " There was a silence during which Walt ate the cheese and drank the whisky . " That air a right likely-lookin ' loggin ' - rig you got out yander , " the girl said . " Your'n ? " " Nope , " said Walt . " B'longs to Squire Whiting . " " Aw , I hyared about you , " Jessie Kate recalled . " You  | run his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know who you air now . " Walt shook his head sadly . " Not no more , " he told her . " He took my job and give it to a nigger . " " Did ? " exclaimed Jessie Kate . " I allus hyared Squire Whiting was a right clever man . I never knowed he was a nigger-lover . " Walt finished off the cheese and drank a gourd of water . " I 'm loggin ' at the Blounts ' now , " he announced . " Come back again , " invited Jessie Kate . " I stay in the store might ' nigh all the time . " Walt drove down the bluffs and to the sawmill , where he found Walker . " Put your team in the corral , " Walker instructed , " and the feed in the crib . I 'll start a couple of hands sawing white oak right away . I want to start close to the river and work this way . It will be about a fivemile haul . You 'll have to swamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week came , Walt put his mules in the lot for the half-holiday Saturday , and he walked up the bluff to Younger 's store . Jessie Kate was there , but she was kept too busy waiting on people to do much talking . Walt met most of the men of the Younger clan , including Little Bas , the leader since Young Bas died . " I knowed yer daddy , " Walt told Little Bas . " I  | mind the time he cleaned up the Pillows and the Potters with a neck yoke , over at my trial at " " Now I mind you ! " declared Little Bas . " Yer the one that wropped that pair er knucks up in yer hand and hit old Tip Abercrombie s ' hard ! " Little Bas slapped his leg and laughed . " Hit were a curiosity ! " he exclaimed . " Jessie Kate , bring I and Mr. Kincaid a drink er thatere special whisky ! ' Y God , I never seed a man look s ' funny in my life as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and disapp'inted ! That 's what he looked like . He looked like a suckin ' calf that had lost the tit and did n't know what to do about hit ! " " He were a worthless old polecat , " Walt declared , bitterly . " And every danged one of his young'ns air jest like him . I married one of his gals , God dang her , and she 's Abercrombie to the bone . No git-up-and-git . And on top er that , she give me a Abercrombie for a son . Why , clang hit all , he ai n't right bright . " Jessie Kate brought three drinks . " I 'll drink this'n ' ' ith you , " she told them . " Why n't you git you a Hoop Pole gal ? " suggested Little Bas . " We got more women than men , since the wars . " " Hit 's a likely idea , " declared Walt , enthusiastically . " I was talkin ' to Jessie Kate , here , the other day . " " Jessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She 's a Younger to the ground . " " ' Y God , I might have a word to say about that , " put  | in Jessie Kate , modestly . " You 'll give Walt to think I run after ever ' danged man that comes on the Ridge . " Little Bas slapped Jessie Kate across the rump . " Git along , " he told her . Walt thought seriously . " The trouble is , " he decided , " Mattie and that danged young'n ' ' d plague the life outn me if I quit her . " " Well , " said Little Bas , " a man ca n't make a mistake like marryin ' into the Abercrombie outfit and not git plagued some for hit . I 'd as soon marry into a graveyard . ' Y God ! They ai n't enough good sound meat and bones in the whole pack to whup yer shadder with . " " Plenty bones , " corrected Walt . " But no git-up-andgit . " With the approach of sunset , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a pair of cotton socks . Jessie Kate made the sales . " I 'll be ' round tomorrow , " Walt told her , " if hit 's suitable to you . " " I 'll be waitin ' for ye , " Jessie Kate promised . " Whar'bouts ? " " I 'm livin ' at Uncle Will 's . Down the road about a quarter . " Walt called the next day , arriving shortly before noon . Jessie Kate greeted him and " made him acquainted " with her uncle Will , her aunt Sue , and an occasional member of the Ridge community who had " jest drapped by , " for no purpose other than to have a look at the man who was courting Jessie Kate . Then  | she retired to the kitchen , leaving her aunt and uncle in the dogtrot to entertain her company . " I never put much stock in the talk , " Aunt Sue explained , " when I hyared you was from Dry Hill . But Will ' lowed Little Bas drunk with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Bas thought you was good enough to drink with , he must think you 're good enough to have Jessie Kate . God knows some man ought to git her . She 's sp'ilin ' for a man , and men air scarce as hen 's teeth . " The fact that everybody on the Ridge knew about the situation and accepted it as practically an engagement did not seem strange to Walt . He understood how closely knit were the lives of the clannish families , and he knew that a lot was taken for granted when a man paid more than passing attention to a woman . Jessie Kate presently came into the dogtrot from the kitchen , untying a calico apron . " Y'all come to dinner , " she called . " Hit ai n't much , but hit 'll fill you up . " " Jessie Kate , " explained Aunt Sue , " cooked up dinner . She allowed a man 's got a right to know what kind of cook a gal is afore he takes up livin ' with her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a-cooked one meal for me , " Walt told them , " I 'll be danged if I 'd a married of her . She could n't cook hot water , hardly , when she married , and she ai n't learned a heap since . " " I allus say , " Jessie Kate remarked , " when a body wants a pair of shoes , they let him try ' em on afore he  | buys ' em . And hit seems to me like a man 's belly ought to have as fair a chance as his feet . " They sat down to a table loaded with mustard greens boiled with side meat , whippoorwill peas , fried chicken , cornpone , huge soda biscuit , butter , and honey . " Ai n't they no buttermilk ? " demanded Uncle Will . " Aunt Sue went to git hit from the spring , " Jessie Kate said . " I ' lowed " I 'll git it , " Aunt Sue stated , rising and going to the kitchen . " Well , by grabs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dished up a powerful-lookin ' dinner . " " Yep , " agreed Uncle Will , " she air a danged good cook . Now , take out and help yourself , Walt . Make yourself to home . " He shoved the dish of mustard greens toward the guest . " No , thank you , I would n't crave none jest now , " said Walt . " I 'll try a few of them peas . " Aunt Sue returned with a cedar bucket filled with cool buttermilk , and dipping with a gourd , she filled the glasses . " God ! this shore is good ! " said Walt . Jessie Kate blushed shyly . " Yep , " reaffirmed Uncle Will , " Jessie Kate air a good cook . " He chuckled at the wit of the remark he was about to make . " But I allus say , " he added , " a gal 's got more to do for a man besides jest cookin ' for him . Plenty gals can cook , now ? " " Aw , dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You jest  | tryin ' to git away with Jessie Kate afore her company . " And turning to Walt , she said , " Do n't mind that old buzzard . He thinks hit 's smart t ' drag up somethin ' dirty . " " Let him go , Aunt Sue , " challenged Jessie Kate . " I 'll take my chances agin ary woman on the Ridge , in the kitchen or in the bed . Uncle Will ca n't git away with us , talkin ' like that . Can he , Walter ? " " Not much , " agreed Walt , stiffly . " I 'll thank ye for some of that chicken . " " ' Y God , Sue , " said Uncle Will , " Walt talks like he 's been there a'ready . He must be a fast worker . " " Now , " snapped Jessie Kate , " you can shet yer danged mouth , Will Younger . And I 'll thank you to keep your jaw out of my business . " Uncle Will laughed boisterously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roared . " ' Y God , your face is red as a beet ! Sue , that 's the first time I ever seen Jessie Kate downright hacked . " " Aw , dry up , Will , " ordered Aunt Sue . " You got Walt hacked worse'n Jessie Kate . " She turned to the guest again , who was beside himself with confusion and embarrassment . " Do n't mind Will , " she told him once more . " He air always talkin ' like that . But hit ai n't a thing but talk . Hit 's been a powerful long time since he broke a bed slat ! " Aunt Sue and Jessie Kate shrieked with laughter , and Walt chuckled . " She shore hacked you that time , " he said .  | " Yep , " admitted Will , " she shore got away with me . Pass me them greens again , Jessie Kate . " After they had finished eating , Uncle Will and Walt retired to the dogtrot for the breeze , while Jessie Kate and Aunt Sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bluff , facing toward the river , six or seven miles away . It was impossible to see the river itself , but when the light was right , one could see the break in the green tops of the trees where the river ran , and beyond lay the purplish blue of the more distant trees on the Arkansas bank . Walt looked longingly across the green sweep . " You talked with Little Bas about settlin ' , yit ? " asked Will . " Jessie Kate air a favorite of his'n , and he 'll set you up well , I reckon . " " Nope , " said Walt . " I ai n't plum made up my mind yit . " " You mean about Jessie Kate ? " There was a dangerous note in Will 's voice . " Jessie Kate suits me fine , " Walt hastened to explain . " I mean about settlin ' . " " Aw , I see , " said Will . He took a twist of tobacco from his pocket , bit off a chew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thanky , " said Walter , removing a plug from his own pocket . " That twist air too stout for me . I chaw Battle Axe . " He bit into the plug . " We got our own ways , here on the Ridge , " Will proceeded . " When a man gits married to one of our  | gals , Little Bas makes up his mind whar they air to settle . Hit saves a heap er trouble , thataway . Keeps down argyments and all . If you ai n't satisfied with what you got , you can lay the blame on Little Bas . And most all of the smart people do n't start no argyment with Little Bas . " " I ai n't talked to him yit , " Walt explained . " Matter of fact , I kind of got my mind set on Arkansas , over yander . " He nodded his head toward the bottoms . " Hit air onusual , " admitted Will . " I would n't make up my mind , if I was you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks git married and settle on the Ridge . " They were silent for some time . Will chewed industriously on his tobacco , occasionally spitting far out into the yard . Walt gazed longingly across the bottoms . Presently the women came from the kitchen , and tilting their straight-backed hickory chairs against the wall , sat down . Aunt Sue took off her shoes . " Have off yer shoes and cool your feet , " Aunt Sue invited . " No , thanky , " Walt declined . " I 'm fixin ' to git along purty soon . " Another silence . " I 'll swear , Jessie Kate , " Walt told her , " that was a good dinner . " " Wa' n't much , " admitted Jessie Kate , " but hit were the best we had . " The conversation was a part of the ritual of manners ; it meant nothing more than ordinary politeness , and  | both Walt and Jessie Kate knew it . The gayety which marked the meal had gone . It was time for serious " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the initiative . " See that purple back er that green ? " He waved his arm in the direction of the bottoms . " Shore , " said Jessie Kate . " Arkansas , " said Walt . He paused and studied the landscape for a while . " Arkansas , " he repeated , " whar a body kin be a man of his own . " He turned suddenly to Jessie Kate . His voice sounded defiance , but his eyes were pleading . " I been bossed and kicked around by somebody , " he told her , " ever since I was born . My daddy , over in Giles County , was hard on me ontil I got big enough to git out . And then , God clang hit , the first thing I done was to git married to Tip Abercrombie 's gal ! I blamed nigh starved to death , puttin ' up with that old polecat . And when I could n't stand him no longer , I hired out to Squire Whiting and was bossed around some more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find me a woman with some git-up-and-git about her , I start layin ' my plans , Will , here , puts on like I got to settle on Hoop Pole and knuckle under Little Bas Younger . " Onderstand , " he added , " Little Bas is as clever a man as I ever see , and if I 've got to knuckle under to somebody , I 'd druther hit 'd be him , with you for my woman , than anybody else and have Mattie . But I wa' n't aimin ' to knuckle under to nobody . "  | Jessie Kate smiled affectionately . " I 'll go to Arkansas with you , Walter . " " Now , Jessie Kate , " cautioned Will , " you better not promise ontil y'all talk hit over with Little Bas . He favors you . And you , too , Walt . But you know how Little Bas air . " " I 'll ' tend to Little Bas , " Jessie Kate said , quietly . " I jest promised Walter I 'd go to Arkansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhars else he wants to take me . " " Will you , honey ? " Walt said . " That 's mighty sweet . " " I 'll go anywhars you say , " Jessie Kate repeated , " and I 'll go any time you say . Right now , if hit suits you . " Walt hesitated . " Hit 'll take somethin ' to git started , " he reasoned . " A man is got to have a start . I got might ' nigh a hun'ed dollars . I got to figger on hit , a few days . " " When you git ready , " Jessie Kate repeated , " I 'll go . " Walt 's mind began to whirl with unrelated details of the difficulties that confronted him . " You know I ca n't marry you , " he explained . " I 'm already married to Mattie . If I married you , too , hit 'd be agin the law . I 'd git in trouble . " " Hit would n't matter in Arkansas , " Jessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye , once ye crossed the river . " " Now , I would n't go makin ' no plans , " advised Will , " ontil ye talk hit over with Little Bas . He kin think up more ways to handle things than ary a man alive . Why ,  | if ye settled here , and Mattie started kickin ' up about you marryin ' Jessie Kate , Little Bas could fix that . " " How ? " asked Walt . " He could take the White Caps over and thrash the thunder out of her , for one thing , " explained Will . " Little Bas can do blamed nigh anything he wants to . " " Nawp , " vetoed Walt , after brief reflection . " I 'll talk to Little Bas , but Arkansas suits me better . " " I 'll talk to Little Bas , honey , " Jessie Kate said . " I can handle him better'n anybody on the Ridge . " " Well , " said Walt , " I b'lieve I 'll git on back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kate , I 'll come and git you . " " Do n't resh off in the heat of the day , " urged Aunt Sue . " Your dinner ai n't fairly settled yit . " " Nawp , I got to git along , " Walt insisted . Then suddenly the idea occurred to him . He asked : " Say , Will , is that ferry still crossin ' the river down at Ashport ? " " Sho ' , " Will told him . Walt turned to Jessie Kate , smiling happily . " Git ready , honey , " he told her . " I 'll come by and git you tomorrow . " " I 'll be ready , honey , " she assured him . Walt frowned in thought for a minute . " I wo n't come through the settlement , " he warned . " Folks might see somethin ' and talk . Git yer bundle and wait for me on the road , about halfway down the gap . " " I 'll be settin ' thar when you come by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottoms , greased the wagon , and mended some broken harness . Then he walked through the woods to the river 's edge , where the big eddy came against the bank . The bank was still caving , and the muddy black sand was soft , although it had been weeks since a rain . That suited his purpose . He searched carefully . He had driven by this spot three or four times every day , for a week , and the earth was cut in patternless wagon and mule tracks . In the dry ground it was impossible to tell which tracks were old and which were new . Walt returned to camp . Early next morning , when he drove out to the woods , he had five two-bushel sacks of shelled corn on the hounds of his wagon . He had also extra log chains which he had pilfered from the blacksmith shop . He made considerable noise , yelling at the mules and complaining that " they air gone plum crazy . " " A day and a half in the corral , " Walt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air as wild as bucks . All I hope is they do n't drag me in the river . " He drove toward the river , as if to bring in a load of oak logs . He listened to the sound of chopping and sawing , back in the bottoms . The timber-cutters , he decided , were too far away to see . He unhooked the three lead mules , and backed the wheelers until both rear wheels of the heavy wagon dropped over the river 's bank and the coupling-pole rested in the soft muddy  | sand . Then he led the wheelers forward , pulling the wagon back on hard ground once more . He studied the tracks thoughtfully . " Looks plain enough , " he decided . That completed , he rehitched his leaders and drove off in a circuitous route to the bluffs , being careful not to go through low places where tracks would be too apparent . Jessie Kate was waiting for him at the gap . But so was Little Bas Younger ! Walt glanced back at the wagon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll brain him , " he told himself , " if he tries to stop me . " But Little Bas had no intention of trying to stop him . " I jest come along , " he explained , " to bid ye farewell . Jessie Kate , here , always was a favorite of mine , and I wish her well . You takin ' Squire Whiting 's log team with ye ? ' Y God , that 'll raise a ruckus , I 'm afraid . " Walt grinned . " Howdy , honey ! " he told Jessie Kate . And then to Little Bas , he said : " Nawp . You air seein ' ha'nts . " " Which ? " demanded Little Bas . " Ha'nts , " repeated Walt . " Walter Kincaid and five mules with the harness and waggin , all fell in the river down at the big eddy this mornin ' and got drowned . The mules run away , and Walter could n't hold ' em , but he rid with ' em into a hun'ed foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the ha'nts of Walter Kincaid and them five mules and the waggin ! "  | " ' Y God ! " was all Little Bas could say . " I tole ye he was smart ! " exclaimed Jessie Kate , proudly . " I 'm shore proud to be the woman of a man that could figger that out ! " " Pitch yer bundle on the back hounds and climb on that corn , honey , " Walt told her . " Me and you air on our way to Arkansas ! And Little Bas , " Walt told him while Jessie Kate was getting seated , " most people do n't b'lieve in ha'nts . So if I was you I would n't git laughed at by tellin ' nobody you seed ha'nts today . " " ' Y God , I do n't b'lieve in ' em myself , " laughed Little Bas . " And if I did , I 'd be ashamed to tell anybody . " " Ready , honey ? " Walt asked . " Ready and r'arin ' to travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Git away , babies ! " shouted Walt . And as soon as the mules started , he looked over his shoulder to Jessie Kate and sang at her gaily : " Oh , they ai n't no niggers , and they ai n't no law , And they ai n't no niggers in Arkansas ! "  | Chapter Eleven I T WAS NOT UNTIL JOSEPH MOVED INTO HIS NEW HOUSE ON THE HILL AND TURNED OVER THE OLD PLACE TO Washington , that his younger brother emerged as a personality in the community . Joseph had been an important figure in that part of Phinizy County since the day he bought part of the old Abercrombie home place . And as his enterprise as a farmer and his ability as a business manager enlarged his land holdings , he grew as rapidly as did the little community around Potter 's store . The building of the road started the great change in the life of that part of the country . The old settlements moved , family by family , to the road , adjacent to families from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which already was tottering , gave way to mixed communities . Richard moved his gin and sawmill near the road , and added a gristmill to the plant . Luther Allbright , who was , by common consent , head of what remained of the Abercrombie clan since Walter had got drowned in the river , put up a blacksmith  | shop . Lafe Potter , who finally collected his wife 's share of the money derived from the sale of the old Pillow grant , opened a general merchandising store . Joseph Goodner built a two-story house on a hill overlooking the community . It was the first house built entirely of sawed lumber , and it presented an impressive sight on the hill , with its white walls and light-green trimmings . Joseph deeded an acre of land , Richard gave the lumber , Luther made the nails for half price , and others gave cash , according to their wealth or enthusiasm , and a church was built . Richard went all the way to Nashville to procure funds for the erection of a public school , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clan on Hoop Pole Ridge , with Little Bas at its head , held together . " We mind our own business , " he told Richard , when the latter approached him on the subject of a school in the settlement . " Us Youngers air got plenty and air doin ' well . If one of our'n gits a hankerin ' for learnin ' , we got plenty to send him off to school . But we air born on Hoop Pole with enough brains to ' tend to our own business . Which , ye might say , air a blamed sight more than some people air able to pick up at a schoolhouse . " Joseph had his family moved on a rainy day in November . It was at breakfast , eaten by lamplight , that he announced his decision . " The house is done , " he stated . " Wash , you see to the wagons and the surrey for Annie and the babies . Annie , you and Luella divide the house-  | hold goods according to your needs . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph ? " Annie was almost pleading . " Certainly , " said Joseph . And turning to his fatherin-law , he said , " All right , Brother Voss . " Brother Voss stood near the lamp , read a psalm from the Bible , and then prayed briefly . " Good-by , " said Joseph , rising . " I 'll be back by noon . " As soon as Joseph was outside , Wash said , " Now , Lu , you and Annie be careful . You just point out to Roy and John Ed what you want loaded , and they 'll attend to it . " Wash dived into the rain to get the two hired men started harnessing the teams . Brother Voss retired to his room to get ready for the half-mile tramp to his school . Annabel , now twelve years old , dressed herself and her two younger brothers for school . Annie and Luella rose and began clearing the table . Suddenly Annie reeled , and would have fallen , but Luella caught her and set her down . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Just giddy . " " Again ? " Luella 's tone was accusing . " I 'm afraid so , " admitted Annie . " Good God ! " exclaimed Luella . " What does Joe think you are ? A brood mare ? " " Hush , Luella , " begged Annie . " Please . "  | " I wo n't hush , " declared Luella . " This makes seven . I 'd stop it , if I had to make a gelding of Joe Goodner . " Annie was crying , almost in hysteria . " Please , please , " she begged . Luella softened , and caressed Annie 's forehead with her hand . " There , there , dear , " she soothed . " Come and lie down . I 'll attend to things . I 'll keep Annabel from school today . She 's a big help . " " I 'll be all right , " said Annie . " You 'll lie down , " Luella insisted . " And you 'll stay in bed . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annie said . " She 'll miss today , " declared Luella , " whether Joe wants it or not . " Annie did not feel equal to further talk . Luella and Annabel went about the business of dividing the furniture and household equipment . Luella was passive , as was generally her manner , except when she was arguing with Joseph about something . The only time she took the initiative was when they came to the parlor . " I 'll keep the piano , " said Luella . " If you want to go on with your lessons , your father can buy you another one . " " The piano is the only thing you 've wanted to keep , Aunt Lu , " reproved Annabel . " You just say , take this , ' and take that , ' until there is n't a thing left . How are you and Uncle Wash going to git along ? "  | " Get along , darling , " Luella corrected . Annabel colored . " I forgot , " she confessed . " Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Luella . " Now , what were you saying ? " " I just said you and Uncle Wash do n't have a thing in the house if we move everything . " Luella smiled . " We 'll have plenty , " she said . The work of loading and hauling the furniture continued all morning . The rain turned into cold sleet . Luella cautioned Wash to build fires in the new house , before Annie and the children were taken over . Wash put the storm curtains on the surrey . Annie and her youngest three children were carefully wrapped , preparatory to the trip through the weather , when Joseph returned from Whitley . His horse was steaming and muddy to the belly . Joseph was hunched in the saddle , under his heavy overcoat . His felt hat was beaten down around the brim , and the rain and sleet had formed icicles in his mustache . He kept his horse at a hard running walk until he got to the surrey where Wash was working . There , Joseph dismounted stiffly , slapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wash , " he said , " I 've provided for you . " " How 's that ? " asked Wash . " Let John Ed attend to those curtains , " said Joseph , " and come inside . I 'll tell you . " Wash followed his brother out of the weather . Joseph  | went into the room which also had been his and Annie 's bedroom . It was obvious that he was about to do something that he considered dramatic , as soon as his audience was complete . Annie followed him in from the hall , where she had been waiting , wrapped in coats and blankets . Luella was already in the room . Joseph walked to the big fireplace , turned his back to it , and folded his hands behind him . " Wash , " he began , " just before Ma died , she asked me to take care of you . I have been doing that . " Wash bit his lips and looked at the floor . " Now , " continued Joseph , " I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He paused again . " With , of course , " he added , " a good start . " I am giving you that start . I am giving you more than a start . I am dividing everything I have made , share and share alike . " " That 's generous , " said Luella , sarcastically , " since Wash did the work and you do the blowing off . " Wash cleared his throat uncertainly . Joseph chose to ignore the interruption . " I have deeded two hundred and fifty acres of land to you , divided the money in the bank , so that you have nineteen hundred and thirty-one dollars and eightyseven cents deposited in your own name . We will divide the implements and stock , in the same way . Now , you 're on your own . Do n't waste your substance . Be careful " Wait a minute , Joseph Goodner , " broke in Luella.  | " Let 's get a few things straightened out before you launch into a sermon and really get to believing that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean ? " Joseph demanded . " You do n't know what I mean ? " challenged Luella . " Well , here 's what I mean . I mean that I 'm not going to allow you to stand there , dripping piety , when you ought to be horsewhipped out of the county . I 'm not going to have you browbeat Wash into believing that you are a big generous brother , when I know , and you know , there is not one iota of generosity in your puny little soul . " " Luella ! " Joseph glared at her . " I wo n't have that kind of talk . " " Oh yes , you will , " insisted Luella . She was standing in the center of the room , facing her brother-in-law . " You are going to stand right where you are and have a lot more of that kind of talk . " " Oh , please do n't quarrel ! " begged Annie . " Sit down , Annie , " Joseph commanded . " Our sister evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No complaints , " Luella corrected , " just an understanding . I probably would have been willing for you to play the generous brother , if you had n't started cackling like some hen that has just laid an egg . I 've always resented the cackling of hens , when they have finished laying . A hen lays an egg , not out of some fine nobility of her soul , but because in the nature of things she has got to lay an egg . And then she cackles ,  | calling attention to it , as if to say , See what a noble thing I 've done . ' " You divided this place with Wash , not out of any sense of nobility ; you did it because in the very nature of your little soul you could n't do anything else . And so you begin a preachment of advice . That is stupid , and I wo n't listen to it . " No doubt you thought you did a generous thing . I imagine you patted yourself on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done such a magnificent thing . And then you stood up here before us all , and cackled . " You deeded this place to Wash not out of generosity ; you deeded it to him because you know you have completely ruined his whole life ; by your domineering manner you have sapped the last drop of character and manhood from him . " Joseph bit his lips in an effort to control his rising temper . " But you did n't do it to salve your conscience , " Luella went on . Her voice was sharp and cold , and she talked with a deadly certainty . " You were n't even that noble . You did it to impress people . First , you wanted them to think you are a just and generous man . Then , after you have cut off from your brother and have grown richer by your hard bargains , and Wash has slipped into the nonentity that you have made of him , you want people to see how much smarter you are than he  | is . You want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to like you . " Joseph cleared his throat , as if to say something , but Luella hurried on : " You sneaked away from Hubbard Springs because people there did n't like you . You said they did n't like you because your father was shiftless and you were poor . You tried to believe that . But all the time you knew it was n't the truth . You knew nobody liked you because there is n't anything likable about you . You blamed your father and your poverty when you knew the blame lay upon you . You ground Wash down , systematically , because Wash had a spark of humanity in him that you did not have , and you were jealous . " And right this minute you 'd give your right eye for the respect and friendship of Squire Whiting " Really , Luella , " Joseph protested at last , " your railing is getting too absurd . Come , Annie ? " " I struck a tender spot that time , did n't I ? " Luella said , hurriedly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would give anything to gain the friendship of Squire Whiting . But you 'll never have it . Dick Whiting knows you just as I know you . And he knows there is nothing likable inside you . " Joseph stood for a moment without a word . He was confused . Indignation surged within him , but as he stood there willfully trying to control his impulse to hurl sharp , cutting words at his sister-in-law , he was conscious of a feeling of loneliness . He wished that he  | could , for some reason that he did not understand , explain things to Luella . For a brief moment it seemed important that Luella be made to understand . But that feeling left with his anger , as his will gained control over his impulses . Presently , he spoke . His voice was calm and studiedly deliberate . " If that is all , Luella , " he said , " I will take my family and leave . " Joseph took the baby from Annie 's arms . " Come on , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had been in the room all during the conversation . Joseph turned to his wife . " Annie , " he demanded , " why is n't that child in school ? " " I kept her home , " Luella told him , before Annie could say anything . " Annie had a spell this morning . She 's pregnant again . " " Leave the room , Annabel , " Joseph ordered , and turning to Luella , he said , " you know better than to speak like that in front of that child . " " I hope she learns something , " retorted Luella . " At least let me rear my own daughter , " snapped Joseph . To his wife , he said , " if you are ill , Annie , I 'll get Mattie Kincaid to look after the house for you . " After Joseph and his family left , Luella stood in front of the fire . Wash sat down and looked at her . Then he turned his gaze out the window . Sleet was whipping against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | heard as it whistled through the limbs of the leafless trees . " Wash , " said Luella , abruptly , " I have just slain a dragon . " " Hunh ? Oh yes , " chuckled Wash . " You pitched into him pretty hard , honey . " He paused and thought carefully . " Maybe , " he speculated , " you were a trifle too rough on him . Joe means well . " " No , he does n't , " denied Luella , promptly . " Every word I said to him was the truth , and he knew it was the truth . " Wash considered a moment . " You are sure of everything you told him ? " he asked . " Every single word , " Luella assured him . " I 've been thinking up that speech ever since we moved here . In fact , I started planning it on the way here . " " You 're dead certain about me , too , I suppose ? " he pursued . " I mean , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luella was surprised , and for a moment she did n't know what to say . " I may have been mistaken about that , Wash , " she admitted . " I hope I was . " Wash said : " No , you were telling the truth about that , too . I 'm a ruined man . Why , if Joe had n't ground me down like that , there 's no telling " " Now , Wash , " Luella cautioned , " let 's drop the subject . Is Stella in the barn ? " " She is . Why ? " " Saddle her for me , please , while I dress . "  | " Surely , Lu , " Wash protested , " you are n't going to ride out in this weather ? " " Why not ? " demanded Luella . Wash could think of no answer , so he saddled the mare . Luella led her to the block , vaulted up , and was off at a run . Her long black riding-skirt whipped down the mare 's flank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a firm rein , but did not try to check her speed . " Steady , girl , " she cautioned . " We are not in a hurry . " In less than an hour she was cantering along the avenue of cedar trees that led to Richard 's front door . As she dismounted , a negro servant handed her a small umbrella and took her horse . Richard and Demetra were waiting on the front porch . " Do come in , Mrs. Goodner , " called Demetra . " We saw you riding across the hill . Come here , by the fire . Or will you change ? You must be soaked to the skin . " " No , thanks , " said Luella . " Let me stand in front of the fire . I 'll drip , I 'm afraid . But it wo n't matter on the hearth , will it ? " " Not at all , " Demetra told her . " Will you take something hot ? " " Whisky , " said Luella . " I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a shock to my stomach . " They laughed . Richard brought the decanter . " This is Middle Tennessee whisky , " he told her . " You are from that part of the country , I believe ? "  | " The smell makes me homesick . " After she drank , Luella took a small hickory chair and sat down near the fire . " Whatever , " Demetra wanted to know , " brought you out on such a bad day ? " " Business with your husband , " Luella told her . " I see , " said Demetra . " I 'll be glad to leave you two " Please do n't , " protested Luella . " Really , I think it would be better if you stayed . I could talk more frankly . " Richard looked at her questioningly . Luella turned to him . " I need help , " she said , simply . There was a pause . She looked at Demetra , and then back to Richard . " It 's sort of messy , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let me tell you why I came here . You were a friend of Percival Jones 's of Pulaski County , were n't you ? He said you were . " " Yes , " said Richard . " I admired Percy a great deal . We were ? " " I know , " said Luella . " All through the war . He told me . I am , among other things , Percy 's first cousin  --  he told me , if I ever got into money difficulties , to look up Roy Miller of Memphis . " Richard nodded his head understandingly . " And , " went on Luella , " he said , if I ever needed a friend or a friendly act , to call on you . " " That 's right , " said Richard . " I did n't know you were Percy 's kinswoman , but , now that I do know it ,  | I shall be delighted . In fact , I 'm under such heavy obligation " Oh , I know about the money , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He told you ? " Demetra asked . " Richard did n't tell me until a year after the war . " " Here is where it gets messy , " said Luella . " Percy and I were more than cousins ; we were lovers . " Yes , I mean exactly that , " she went on , hurriedly , " but it was beautiful ; it was magnificent . " She stood up , majestic and proud . " I understand , darling , " Demetra said . " We had been in love with each other since we were children . Percy was sensitive and shy . " " He was a shy boy , though , " insisted Luella . " People teased him about his name , and I resented that . He was too fine to be teased . Perhaps that was the start . " As we grew older , it became apparent that we could never get married ; we were first cousins , you see . That , I think , made us closer to each other . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never a prouder woman in the world than I was the day Percy rode off to war ! " Her eyes shone , and she began to pace back and forth in front of the fire . " Nor was there a handsomer or braver soldier in uniform than he . " She stopped and stood looking into the fire . Her voice grew calmer . " I saw him only one time after that . Nearly three years after he left , he slipped away from camp and  | came to me . The war had not coarsened him one particle . He still was the fine , sensitive man that I loved . But we were hungry for each other  --  so hungry that we flew into each other 's arms . Oh , it was too ridiculous ! " She laughed wildly . " In the barn , where he was hiding ! Two love crazed virgins in a manger ! My God ! The hay sticking us " Demetra arose and put her arms around Luella . " Do n't , my dear , " she soothed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She led Luella to a big chair . " Try a little more of this whisky , " urged Richard , handing her a drink . " All of us have had our upsetting moments . It 's all right . " Luella drank the whisky and relaxed in the chair . " Anyway , " she concluded , " after it was over , Percy told me about the money and about you . Then he said good-by . I knew that I would never see him again . I knew that he was ashamed of what we had done . I was not ashamed ; I was proud . But I understood exactly how he felt about it , and I understood why he felt that way . " He killed himself , three days later . " " No , " corrected Richard . " The Percy Jones I knew was killed at Cumberland Gap , in battle . " " I know , " said Luella . " But not by a Yankee bullet . He shot himself . I know he did . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Demetra stood by the side of Luella 's chair , and put her arm around Luella . " There , there , " she said , softly .  | " I married Washington Goodner after the war , " Luella went on , calmly . " You know what his brother has done to him , do n't you ? " " Joe , " observed Richard , " strikes me as a pretty stern citizen . I can imagine what he would do to anyone who lived around him long enough . " " That 's exactly what he did , " confirmed Luella . " I thought for a while I was going to be able to love Wash . Not as I had loved Percy , of course , but in another way . In Hubbard Springs I had been seeing Joe ruin his brother all of my life , and I decided that if Joe ever got out of the way , I could make something out of the poor creature . I almost did it , too . But Joe came back too soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though she were ready to leave , and added , " Now Joe has delivered the death blow . " " How 's that ? " asked Richard . " He has deeded a lot of land to Wash . " Richard frowned . " I do n't understand , " he said , " unless you mean that he wants to kill his brother with kindness . That 's pretty valuable land . " " No , " said Luella , " you do n't understand . It is like giving a board to a weak swimmer , and teaching him to rely on it until he gets into deep water , and then ? " " I see , " said Richard . " You think Joe really is as hard a case as that ? " " I do , " declared Luella.  | " And how can I help you ? " asked Richard . " Of course , if you need any money , there is always ? " " No , " said Luella , definitely , " Wash 'll never need any money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to crush Joe Goodner . " Richard frowned . " I 'm afraid , " he told her , " I 'm not in the crushing business . " " But , Richard , " pleaded Demetra , " surely you can do something ? " " As a matter of fact , " said Richard , " Joseph Goodner is going to be the next trustee . The county needs exactly his type of man to collect and handle the tax money . " Luella slumped to the chair . She was defeated . " But I 'll make you a promise , " Richard went on . " Both as a tribute to my friendship with Percy Jones , and because I admire a woman who will battle for a principle as you evidently have been battling . I will see that your husband has a more exalted position in the community than his brother will ever have . " " What ? " demanded Luella . " Wash has n't one spark of ability for anything . " " He wo n't need it , " declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll look after Wash . " Luella stood and held out her hand to Richard . " Thank you , Dick Whiting , " she said . " You have made me very happy . And wherever Percy Jones is at this minute , I know he is pleased that his friend has found a way to make his sweetheart happy . "  | Chapter Twelve UELLA CANTERED STELLA ALONG THE ROAD BETWEEN THE WALLS OF TREES . THE WIND HAD DIED DOWN , the sleet had stopped , and a soft , wet snow was falling . The flakes struck her face and melted . Drops of water ran down her cheeks and into the top of the high whalebone collar that fitted snugly about her neck . She tried to whistle an old tune that she remembered from Hubbard Springs days , but the melody escaped her . Stella 's feet sank deep as she galloped down the road , and Luella swayed in rhythm with the horse 's gait . As she neared the road forks , where the trail from The Cedars turned into the county road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steady , girl , " she said . " I 'm too happy to get thrown off here . " She turned into the county road , and resumed . As she approached Potter 's store she noticed that Wash 's saddle horse was standing with the half dozen others at the hitch-rack . " He 's making a holiday of it , " she mused . And , on impulse , she pulled her horse to the rack and dismounted .  | As she walked into the store she heard Wash 's voice . Halfway down the room was a huge wood-stove and a dozen or more men were standing or sitting around it . Wash had his back to the door , and as she stepped inside he was saying : " The Yankees dragged some field-pieces to the top of Malvern Hill , and were cutting us down like wheat before the scythe . And about that time Colonel Pearce ? John Pearce of Louisville , he was  --  rode up . He pulled his sword and waved it above his head . We 've got to charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ! Up and at ' em ! ' So we let out the rebel yell , and " " Pull your flag down , Wash , " Luella interrupted . " The war 's over . " Wash turned sheepishly . The men all greeted her and began sidling off . " Do n't mind me , " said Luella . " I just rode by to tell my husband that supper would be ready soon , if he helped me tote some things from the store . " She made a few small purchases and she and Wash rode home . As they neared the rail fence which surrounded the house and the barn the place looked suddenly desolate and forbidding to Luella . She had been living there nearly five years and she thought it strange she had never actually seen the house before . It consisted of four huge log rooms , two on each side of a wide hall . Against each of the two back-log rooms a plank addition had been built . The planks were old and discol-  | ored , but they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an air of haphazard indecision . The entire establishment was innocent of paint . A gnarled box-elder tree , leafless and cold , grew at the side of the doorstep . The windows were black splotches against the dull gray of the poplar logs . Four brick chimneys , two on each side of the house , rose gaunt and smokeless into the gray sky . Luella stopped her horse and swung to the ground . " Give me Clipper , Wash , " she directed . " I 'll turn them in the barn . You go build up the fires . " Wash protested . " You go on inside . I 'll unsaddle , and come in and build the fires , in a minute . " " No , " said Luella , positively . " I would n't walk into that place like it is ! Oh , Wash , I 'm afraid ! " " Well , well , " Wash consoled . " Honey , there is n't a blamed thing going to hurt you . There 's nothing to be afraid of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Luella went with him , and waited in silence until he had finished . " It is foolish to be afraid , " she said , " but the place looks so ? " " Kind of lonesome , " Wash supplied . " I felt that , too . Any place is lonesome when Joe and Annie and their brood have left it . After living around them for so long , I reckon we 'll feel lost , over here by ourselves , until we get used to the change . " They reached the doorstep and Wash opened the  | door . " I 'll have a fire roaring in no time , " he promised . Luella followed him . Her steps were resolute , but she shivered as she walked in . She imagined an icy blast swept past her as she went through the door . " I wonder if we will , " she said . " Will what ? " asked Wash . " Ever get used to living here . " " Sure , " declared Wash . He blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashes , and placed a few splinters of dry poplar upon them . A little blaze appeared . He added more wood , and soon a sizable fire was going . " Now , I 'll lay on some oak , " he announced , " and this place will be as warm and snug as you please , in no time . " " Wash , I am scared , " insisted Luella . " Suppose somebody broke in ? " " Nobody 's going to do that , honey , " Wash insisted . " nut if you 'll feel any safer , I 'll get the pistol . " " The pistol would n't do any good , " said Luella . " Of course I know nothing is going to happen . But I just feel frightened . " " I 'll get the gun , anyway , " said Wash , rising , " if I can find it . " He searched about until he found a large military pistol , and an ammunition-box . He poured powder into the muzzle , wadded paper against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he raised the hammer and put a cap under it . " I 'll put it under the pillow , " he said , " just in case . "  | The fire grew and roared , and the flames cast weird shadows on the wall . " That looks cheerful , does n't it ? " Wash asked . " Sort of warms up the place , and makes it look homey and all . " Luella smiled . " It 's much better , " she agreed . " You know , " Wash continued , " I 've sort of dreamed of something like this , for a long time . " He took Luella 's hand . " A big fire going , on a gray , wintry day , with just us two all by ourselves . Not having to sneak around , and be quiet , and not afraid that one of Joe 's dad-gummed brats will come popping into the room any minute Luella squeezed his hand gently . " It was troublesome , was n't it ? " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on Wash , " not a soul to bother us . Seems kind of funny , does n't it , Lu ? Just us , here in this big room , with a big fire going and all . " He put his arm around her waist and held her tightly . Luella kissed her husband . Wash led her to the bed . It was the first time since they were married that they had lain together in anything like privacy . For the first time , too , Luella 's mind was not preoccupied with constant apprehension . It was a new experience for her . It was as though she were watching objectively without attempting to relate what she saw to her husband and herself . The man was awkward , the woman pas-  | sive . She could not decide whether it was ridiculously funny or merely disgusting . Luella lay for a long time staring blankly into space . Shadows from the fire played tricks upon the ceiling . She watched them without seeing them . Wash , now , was asleep , breathing regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dim light from the fire she could see him lying with one arm flung out , his mouth slightly open , and his beard , full and untrimmed , gave him a disheveled , uncouth look . Luella shuddered . " Percy could n't have looked like that , if he tried , " she told herself . She was shocked when she realized that she had compared Wash with Percy . She got out of bed and stood before the fire . The blaze had died down , but the heat from the live coals warmed through her nightgown . She walked about the room nervously . Then , barely realizing what she was doing , she began to dress hurriedly as though her life depended upon getting into her clothes and escaping from the house . She had taken off her riding-habit hours before , and without thinking , she donned the long black skirt again . Then , finding herself dressed for riding , she went to the barn , saddled Stella , and rode into the night . It was clear and cold . The sleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the surface of  | the muddy road was frozen over , so that Stella 's feet made clean , crunchy sounds as she galloped . The fresh night air , whipping against Luella 's face , was refreshing and cleansing . She breathed deeply , pulled her horse to a walk and dropped the reins , allowing Stella to wander where she pleased . It was just such a night as this back in Hubbard Springs , Luella recalled , with frost on the windows , and many quilts on the bed , when her negro maid had waked her and whispered into her ear , " Somebody in de barn , Miss . " That was all the servant had said , " Somebody in de barn , Miss ! " Luella 's heart beat excitedly at the memory . " Oh , Percy ! Darling Percy ! " she called . The horse bolted , and ran so suddenly that Luella almost fell off . When she recovered the reins , it took all her strength and cunning to pull the mare under control again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There , not too fast . Steady , girl . " Stella kept pulling at the bit , her long slim legs whipping over the muddy road with an easy graceful sweep . Luella 's wrists grew tired and were cramping . She saw a light shining through a window in the settlement , and she headed for it . The light was at Lafe Potter 's house . Luella had no idea what time of night it was when she rode up , but it was a relief to her wrists for Stella to come to the hitch-post and stop . Luella dismounted .  | " Hal-loo ! " she called . The door opened . Lafe appeared , and behind him , with a lamp in hand , was Mersery . " Who is it ? " demanded Lafe . " Mrs. Wash Goodner , " Luella replied . " Come in , " Lafe invited . Luella noticed that both Lafe and Mersery were in their night-clothes . She felt some explanation was due them for the late call . " I was out riding , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was afraid  --  nervous and tired , I reckon  --  so I pulled in here to get hold of myself . " " Well , " said Mersery , " you 're welcome . Take a cheer . I and Lafe was up doctorin ' Brig . He had a little croup " Brig ? " repeated Luella . " Brigadier-General Bushrod Johnson Potter is his whole name , " smiled Mersery . " Lafe named him . Did n't you , honey ? " " Yep , " said Lafe , proudly . " I hope he 'll grow up half as good a man . " " I know the Bushrod Johnsons , " Luella said . " They are all fine people . " " Brigadier-General Bushrod Johnson , " Mersery explained , " was Lafe 's officer durin ' the war . " " I understand , " said Luella . " How is the baby 's croup ? Did you try honey and white of egg ? " " He 's all right , now , " Mersery said . " He gits the croup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You 're proud of him , are n't you ? " Luella asked .  | " I reckon hit 's a race betwixt I and Lafe as to which is the proudest of that young'n ' , " Mersery declared . " He 's a curiosity ! Maybe not no better'n ary other young'n ' his age . But I and Lafe think so . " Luella smiled warmly . " A beautiful name , too , " she mused . " I would like to have had a son named Lieutenant-General Nathan Bedford Forrest Jones . " " I thought Mr. Goodner was with Pearce ? " said Lafe . Luella looked startled . " Aw , Lafe , " put in Mersery . " Maybe Mrs. Goodner wa' n't as lucky as me and you was . Maybe Mr. Goodner is her second choice . " " He is , " said Luella , sadly . " There , now , I knowed hit , " said Mersery . " Ever ' time I seed you ridin ' by on that chestnut mare , chargin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , I jest knowed you wa' n't happy with your man . I knowed you either had n't found a true-love , or you had found him and lost him . " " I found him and lost him , " Luella said , quietly . " He was killed . " Mersery wiped the tears from her eyes . " Hit air a pity , " she declared . " A cryin ' pity . I could n't ' a ' stood hit , if Lafe had got killed . You see , I reckon me and Lafe loved each other harder than most people . And if he had ' a ' got killed , I reckon I jest could n't ' a ' stood hit . "  | " Now , honey , " said Lafe . " I did n't git killed , and so they 's no need to go cryin ' . " " May I have a drink of whisky ? " Luella asked , suddenly . " Sho ' , and kindly , " Lafe assured her . " Git the jug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y'all Goodner women would take a drink , seein ' as the men do n't . Or else , I 'd ' a ' offered hit , afore this . " Mersery poured half a tumblerful of whisky , and Luella drained the glass . The drink made her throat tingle and she shuddered . " The Goodner women , " she said , " do n't drink . " Then suddenly she began to cry , like a child that is frightened . She clutched at Mersery and clung to her desperately . " I 'm so glad your man did n't get killed , " she said . " I 'm so glad . I 'm glad for you . " Then , as suddenly as she had sta  --  ted , she stopped crying . Mersery was a little frightened and upset , but she petted Luella , and said , " You pore thing , " over and over . Luella stood up and brushed down her skirts . " Thank you so much , " she told them . " You were nice to let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured . " You 're more'n welcome . You want I should go ' long home with ye , in case yer horse runs again ? " Luella smiled . " No , thank you . And Mrs. Potter , I hope that Brigadier-General Bushrod Johnson Potter 's  | croup does n't bother him again . If it does , try the white of an egg , mixed with honey . " " Thanky , ma'am , " said Mersery . Luella walked out of the door . Mersery wiped a tear from her eye with one hand , and she touched her husband tenderly with the other . " The pore , scared thing , " she said . " I feel so sorry for her I could cry . " " She 's a curiosity , " admitted Lafe . Luella allowed her mare to gallop all the way home . There , she unsaddled and turned Stella into the stable . Then Luella went to the house . The fire had burned down to a dull glow of embers . She put on a small stick of wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep . He had rolled on his side and was snoring louder . Luella undressed hurriedly and put on her nightgown . The wood blazed higher , throwing a bright steady light all over the room . There were no dancing shadows . The whole room was clearly outlined . Wash , lying under the heavy quilts , was plainly perceptible . Luella watched him for a long while . She walked to the bed . Her mind was clear now . No longer was there confusion or hope or disappointment . " No woman can stand it , " she said , and smiling happily , she took the pistol from under the pillow and pressed the muzzle against her breast . " Good-by , Wash , " she said , gently , and pulled the trigger .  | Chapter Thirteen LUELLA 'S FUNERAL WAS THE FIRST BIG ONE EVER HELD IN MOUNT ENON CHURCH . BROTHER VOSS HAD CONducted several funerals there , before , and everybody in the neighborhood came , wept , and offered condolences to the bereaved families . But none of them approached that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from Hoop Pole Ridge and Forked Deer . Brother Stanley , the presiding elder , conducted the rites , in spite of the fact that Mount Enon had not been formally admitted into the Conference . It was ten minutes past midnight when Luella died . Wash awakened by the roar of the pistol , leaped from the bed in confusion . " Luella was on the floor , " he said later . " I reckon that old pistol knocked her plum out of bed . I stopped the clock as quick as I thought about it , which could n't have been more than a minute after the gun went off . I yelled for Joe a time or two before I remembered they had all moved out . Then I ran to the barn and caught Clipper , and rode as hard as I could to Joe 's house . "  | Wash said to Joseph , " I reckon she rolled over in the night , and touched the trigger . " " I did n't know you kept a loaded pistol in your bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight , " Wash explained . " Lu was nervous , being in the house with nobody but me , so I loaded it , and put it under the pillow . " Wash did not remember which pillow , not that anybody asked him . " And I reckon she got to threshing around in her sleep ? " " Now calm down , " Joseph ordered . " You loaded the pistol yourself ? " " Yes . Lu felt nervous about " And you put a cap on it ? " " Yes , " said Wash , " I put a cap on it . " " And you forgot to let the hammer down on the cap . Wash , you put a cocked pistol under the pillow ! " " 0 God , Joseph ! " pleaded Wash . " You reckon I forgot to let the hammer down ? " " You always were careless , " accused Joseph . " No , " Wash pleaded . " I seem to remember , now . I let that hammer down on that cap " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated Joseph . " But I did , " insisted Wash . " It 's clear to me now ? " Joseph shook his head . " You did not , Wash . You may think you did . Your imagination gets away with you . Now let 's say no more about it . Whatever you did , you did through carelessness . "  | " I killed my wife ! " cried Wash . " Oh , Lu , I did n't go to do it ! Oh , before God Almighty , I did n't go to do it ! " " Shut up , now , " Joseph ordered , crisply . " Hold on to yourself . Nobody 's accusing you of murder . You go lie down and keep quiet . I 'll wake up Annie and Brother Voss . Annie can go over there tonight , with her Pa . " " I ca n't lie down , " protested Wash . " I 'll never be able to lie down again . Oh , Lu , honey , I meant to let that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph said . He woke up the household , and explained briefly what had happened . " Brother Voss , " he said , " you 'd better take Annie over there to sit up . Stop by and get Mattie Kincaid to stay with Annie , too . Mattie is due to start here tomorrow , and it 's past midnight , now . " Wake up John Ed Suggs when you get over to the other place , and start him out to Whitley in the wagon . I 'll meet him there . Get word to Luther Allbright to have the grave dug sometime during the day . We 'll set the funeral for four o'clock . That will give John Ed time to get back with the coffin . " Joseph went out , saddled his horse , and rode to Whitley . The news traveled rapidly over the community . Before daylight , neighbors began dropping in , offering their help and asking for details of the tragedy . Seven women , directed by Mattie Kincaid , who was acting  | for Annie , bathed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long poplar board , and adjusted them into the back of two chairs , for the cooling-board . Lafe Potter and his wife , instead of opening the store that morning , walked up the hill to offer their aid and condolence . Mersery Potter clung to Lafe 's arm foolishly , and tried to laugh and cry at the same time . " I do n't think she 's right bright , " observed Armajewel Suggs , who , because John Ed was employed on the place , assumed a special interest . " You 'd think Mersery Potter was a blood sister to Miz Goodner , instid of jest plain river-bottom white trash , the way she 's carryin ' on . Humph ! As if Luella Goodner would spit on the likes of her ! " An hour later , when Richard and Demetra rode up , Armajewel felt better . Demetra went straight to Annie and spoke quietly with her . When Demetra came out of the room , tears stood in her eyes . She held her head low and walked hurriedly to her horse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the mounting-block . They galloped off . " That , " said Armajewel , " is more like what Miz Goodner is used to . " Brother Voss retired to the seclusion of his old room . It was bare of furniture now , but it was nice in there . He built himself a little fire and sat down on a log of wood . Calmly , deliberately , he went over the whole circumstances . From time to time he muttered to himself : " It 's queer . It 's certainly queer . " Then he knelt in the  | privacy of the room and prayed . He pleaded , first , for a clear mind so that he could see things as they were and not as they seemed . Next , he begged for divine guidance in the course that he would follow . When he left the room he learned that Annie had become ill and had been taken back home . Mattie Kincaid was now in full charge and Brother Voss noticed that Mattie acted with a quiet dignity . She knew everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explaining briefly that Mrs. Joseph Goodner was too ill to be there , and that she was acting in her stead . " May I speak to you , Mattie ? " Brother Voss asked . " In here , please . " They went into the room , and Brother Voss closed the door . " What do you think ? " he asked her . " Somethin ' queer , " Mattie confessed , frankly . " But what , I do n't know . " " Neither do I , " said Brother Voss . " But I hope to find out . " " I 'd like to help , " Mattie declared . Brother Voss studied for some minutes . " You know what Wash thinks ? " he asked . " That he left the pistol cocked , through keerlessness ? " " Do you think that is Wash 's own idea ? " pressed the minister . " Joe Goodner put that in his mind , " Mattie declared , bitterly . " In the first place , Wash Goodner do n't think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ner is low-down mean . . . . Say , Joe Goodner hated Miss Luella worse than pizen . I wonder if he ? " " No , no . Positively not , " declared Brother Voss . " I have gone over that idea thoroughly . Joe is n't the kind that would do a thing like that . Let 's not consider that possibility any longer . Joe and Luella have kept up a running fight for the past six years . I thought I saw murder in Luella 's eyes , at one time , but I realized that she was too clever a woman to kill Joe . I think she had some more fiendish idea in her mind . Now , if Joe had been afraid of her , he might have killed her . But he was n't afraid . Joe was certain of himself on that point . " " I would n't put it past him , " reiterated Mattie . " No , I 'm positive he did n't do it , " insisted Brother Voss . " Did you take notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No , not a thing , " said Mattie . " Anybody here acting oddly ? " " No , not much . Mersery Potter cried uncommon hard , and Miss Demetry Whiting walked out of the house like she 's jest seen a ha'nt . " " Not much , " admitted Brother Voss . " Now let 's forget that we talked in here , and let 's forget everything we talked about . Just as though it never had been said . " " All right , Brother Voss , " agreed Mattie . He got his hat and walked across to Joseph 's house on the hill . He walked slowly , picking his way around the mudholes . He was thinking over every known de-  | tail of the tragedy . He found Wash staring blankly at the fire , muttering foolishly to himself . " Wash , " Brother Voss said , sternly , " pull yourself together and talk to me sensibly . Tell me exactly what happened . " Wash repeated what he had told Joseph , soon after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of bed , " he added . " She was on the floor ? " " How far from the bed ? " " Oh , I did n't notice . You do n't notice things like that when your wife is ? " " I know , " interrupted Brother Voss . " How close do you believe she was ? " " Close . Just like she rolled out , on the floor . " " Do you remember , " pressed Brother Voss , " whether you let the hammer down on the pistol ? " " I must have left it cocked , " Wash admitted . " Or how else ? " " Do you remember ? " demanded the preacher . " No , I do n't , " Wash admitted . " I think I remember , but now ? " " Was Lu in good spirits when she went to bed ? " Wash looked pleadingly at the minister , and nodded an affirmative . " What makes you think so ? " Wash 's face went blank , his eyes stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Talk , man , " urged the preacher . " Hold yourself together . "  | Wash shook his head . " That 's what makes it so bad on me , " he wailed . " My carelessness ? " " Tell me , " insisted Brother Voss . " It is of great importance to you , Wash . Your whole future depends on what I can find out . " " Well , " stammered Wash , " she was scared when we got in the house , and I got the pistol out . Then , when the fire got bright and warm , it come to us that here we were , man and wife , in our own house , and , well ? " " I see , " said Brother Voss . " You did your family duty . It 's nothing to be ashamed of . And then you went to sleep ? " " Yes . " " Did Luella go to sleep , too ? " " I reckon so . The next thing I knew was when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and saw Luella on the floor , where was the pistol ? " Wash shook his head . " God only knows , " he said . " I did n't even think to look . " Brother Voss put his arm around Wash 's shoulder and patted him . " Wash , " he said , " keep this in your mind and forget everything else , no matter what anybody tries to tell you . You let the hammer down on that pistol cap before you put it under the pillow . Remember that , Wash . It was not due to your carelessness that Luella was killed . " " Oh , " moaned Wash , " I wish I could remember . "  | " You 'll remember what I told you , " the preacher repeated . Brother Voss went to Potter 's store next . People on their way home from Wash 's house were using the store for a meeting-place in which to discuss the tragedy . There Brother Voss learned that Wash had been in the store , the evening before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pleasant and as clever as you please , " they told Brother Voss . " She was a clever , genteel woman , if ever there was one . And just when her and Wash was setting out on their own , too . It 's mighty sad . " " Where had she been ? " asked the preacher . No one knew . " Lafe , I 'd like to speak privately with you , " Brother Voss invited . They retired to the back of the store , and the preacher asked him , without any preliminaries , how friendly his wife was with Luella . " I 'll let you talk to Mersery about that , " Lafe said , and he conducted Brother Voss to his dwelling , in the rear of the store . Mersery related to the preacher her version of what had happened the evening before . " Hit were about ten o'clock , " she said , " when Miz Goodner rid up . And she stayed about a hour , I reckon . " " Did she seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Poor lamb , " she said . " She were like a scairt rabbit when she come in . She ' lowed her horse run away with her , but she can ride  | that horse too good to git scairt at that . No horse ever put that kind of look in Miz Goodner 's eyes . She was scairt and worried . She talked a heap , too . I do n't reckon I should n't ought to tell you what she said . " " You must , " insisted Brother Voss . " I 'm an ordained preacher , and I wo n't tell a soul what you tell me . It 's very important that I know . Her husband 's sanity depends on it . " Mersery looked at Lafe , and he nodded . " He air a preacher , " Lafe said . " I reckon you better tell him . " " Well , " began Mersery , " when you come right down to tellin ' of hit , they ai n't much to tell . She said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' a ' had a boy named for Old Forrest , like that . And Lafe recollected that Mr. Goodner was with Pearce instid of Old Forrest , and Miz Goodner said her first love rid with Old Forrest , and got kilt in the war . I said I could n't ' a ' stood hit if Lafe had got kilt . And she cried and carried on a minute . And then she quit cryin ' and stood up . When she stood up , she was n't scairt no more . I could see hit in her eyes . Clear and bright , I could see hit . " " See what ? " " Death , " said Mersery , simply . " Clear as a crystal hit was . You see , " Mersery went on to explain , " she lost her love , and she tried to love another man . Well , you see how it was . Her love was dead , and here she was a-livin ' , tryin ' to love another man . Then all at once she seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still trying to explain something that she could not grasp . " Lafe , I 'd like to borrow a rig to drive over to Squire Whiting 's . " The rig was supplied , and the old preacher drove to The Cedars . " I 'm afraid , Squire , " Brother Voss announced , " that I gave you a little misinformation about the tragedy , this morning . At the time I talked with you I thought it was an accident . Now I am certain it was selfdestruction . " " I was confident that it was suicide , " Richard said . " She was over here yesterday , and I do n't think I have ever seen a more desperate case . The poor child , I was awfully sorry for her , and I made her some slight promises . " " I 'm trying , " Brother Voss explained , " to save the sanity of her husband . He is torn with the idea that her death was due to his carelessness about priming the pistol . " " For certain reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard stated , " my official report on the matter shall be that the death was accidental . However , since the promises I made had to do with the welfare of Wash Goodner , I shall be delighted to assure him privately that it was suicide . " " I think , " said Brother Voss , " that it would save him . " " I 'll talk to him after the funeral . "  | Brother Voss considered a minute . " Would you do me a great favor ? Would you bring Wash over here for a few days ? I do n't want him to go back to living with Joseph . In a few days I 'll have made other arrangements . " " It would be a pleasure , " Richard said . The coffin was the handsomest one most of the Phinizy County people had seen . It was the first storebought one that many of them had seen . " Nothin ' , " said Armajewel , " air too dear for the Goodners . " The presiding elder read the services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour . Then he devoted a quarter of an hour to eulogistic generalities . He did not know the deceased , personally , but had heard good report of her . She was a kind and loving wife , and an humble servant of the Lord . Her soul was in Glory , now that it had pleased God in His infinite wisdom and grace to call her home . " Brother Voss , " he concluded , " who knew the deceased more intimately , will utter a few kind words . " Brother Voss gazed a long time into the opened casket . " We will miss you , Luella , " he said , softly . " We will miss you very much , indeed . You were a force , an influence for the better , in our little family . " He raised his eyes and looked squarely at Joseph , who was on the front row , with Annie on one side of him , and Wash on the other . Wash was dry-eyed , solemn , dull ; Annie wept occasionally ; Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corners of his  | eyes and rolled down his cheeks unnoticed , until they lost themselves in his side whiskers . " We are standing in the presence of death , " Brother Voss continued . " If we believe in the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ , death is not the end of life . Death is merely the beginning of life everlasting . " " Amen , " said the presiding elder . " Eternal life , " continued Brother Voss , " is the spirit of God and God is the Spirit . My friends , we are standing here in the presence of Almighty God ! " A woman shrieked , another cried hysterically , and in a moment half the people in the little church were shouting . Wash leaped to his feet and ran to the casket . " I want to go with you , Lu ! " he screamed . " I want Brother Voss stepped out of the pulpit and swung his big fist against Wash 's jaw . Wash dropped to the floor . Then Brother Voss stooped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he directed , " so I can stretch him out . " Renshaw Blount nudged Richard . " I know that preacher ! " he exclaimed . " He 's been around here for several years , " said Richard . " I know , " Shaw told him , " but I 've seen him before he came here . I wonder where ? " As soon as the place quieted , the pall-bearers bore the casket to the graveyard behind the church . There the rest of the ritual was read and the box was lowered .  | As soon as the grave was filled , Demetra sought out Joseph and Annie . " Dick and I , " she said , as though she were an intimate friend , " would like to have Wash stay with us for a few days . Poor fellow , the change will do him good . You do n't mind , I 'm sure ? " " Why  --  er ? " Joseph stammered , " it 's kind of you . Yes . I had n't thought about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But for a few days I agree the change might do him good . " Less than ten yards away from where Demetra was talking to Joseph , Brother Voss walked up to Mattie Kincaid . " Come , Mastic , " he said , quietly , " you and I are going to Whitley to get married . " " What ? Why , Bro " " Shh , " warned Brother Voss . " Go get in Wash 's hack . I 'll join you in a minute . "  | Chapter Fourteen THE DRIVE HOME FROM THE FUNERAL WAS MADE IN SILENCE . JOSEPH HELD THE LINES FIRMLY , GUIDING the trotting horses expertly over the muddy roads . Beside him , in the front seat of the surrey were Annabel , Andrew and Thomas . On the back seat were Annie and the three younger children . John Ed and Armajewel Suggs already had got to the house when Joseph drove up . John Ed took charge of the team , and Armajewel helped Annie with the children . When they were inside , and unwrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nod to Annabel . Then he spoke . It was the first time he had spoken since he left the churchyard . " Annie , my dear , " he began , and then he faltered , clearing his throat awkwardly . " Yes , Joseph ? " Annie said . Joseph could never decide whether Annie 's voice on such occasions signified patient resignation or plain boredom . But he had made up his mind to talk , and  | he decided not to let Annie 's attitude swerve him this time . " I have been thinking , " he stated , solemnly , " about Luella . " Annie 's lips quivered and she brushed away a tear . " I mean about what she said , " Joseph continued , " yesterday . " His throat closed , his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth . He could not go on . Annie looked at him . Her large , blue , patient eyes were sparkling with tears . " Yes , Joseph ? " Joseph suddenly grew angry . He was angry with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luella ? even though she were dead  --  for what she had said to him . But most of all , he was angry with himself for weakening to the point of wishing to take anyone in his confidence . Yet , he had started talking , and there were certain things it would be best to explain to Annie before she formed her own opinions . " Railing , " Joseph declared . " Plain , simple ranting and railing . Not a word of truth in what she said . " " Of course , Joseph , " Annie said . " Luella , poor thing , was high strung , and under heavy tension all the time ? " " I know that , " Joseph interrupted . " I am neither criticizing her nor trying to apologize for what she did . Her life was her own , and she lived it as she saw fit . What I want to say to you  --  to my wife , in the privacy  | of our home  --  is this : Luella destroyed herself . Took her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , " said Annie . " But , " went on Joseph , " in view of certain things that she accused me of doing in connection with our brother , I think it best that you understand . Wash believes her death was accidental . I encouraged him in that belief . I went even farther . I convinced him that the accident was due to his own carelessness . That , I hope , will make him less careless in the future , and at the same time give credence to the belief that it was accidental . " " Poor Wash ! " said Annie . " He is frantic . I do hope his visit with the Whitings helps him . " " Of course , " said Joseph , " Wash would get all the sympathy . You have n't a thought for the rest of the family , I suppose ? " " Why , Joseph , what do you mean ? " " This is what I mean , " stated Joseph . " Wash will groan and carry on for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel powerfully bad about it all . But he 'll get over it . But how long do you suppose it would take the Goodner family to live down a suicide ? That 's what you had n't thought of when you offered your sympathy to Wash . " Annie looked startled , but she remained silent . " I am trying , as hard as I know how , " Joseph almost pleaded , " to establish our family so that we will command the respect of the community . Wash has never  | done one thing to help build up that respectability . He may as well feel badly for a few days , thinking his own carelessness killed his wife . At least , he owes the family that much . He brought that woman in . She had no business in our family . She was a Jones . She was a Jones , and the Jones family always was a hard-drinking , hard-living , Godless bunch . I bore her patiently for six years ? " " Joseph ! " Annie was alarmed . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " It was more of a warning than a question . " Excuse me , Annie , " apologized Joseph . " I almost forgot myself . " " I think you did , " said Annie , with a coolness that was strange to her . " At any rate , " Joseph concluded , hurriedly , " you understand my position as it relates to Wash . That was what I wanted you to understand , although I did not say exactly what I had planned . My whole idea is to conduct myself so that we can hold our heads up in this community , with that sense of respectability that only comes with right living . " When he finished talking , his mouth snapped shut and his jaw shot forward . Annie knew that he would continue to be his usual stern self , although she had hoped Luella 's death might soften him some . " Where are the children ? " he asked , abruptly . " The house is n't thoroughly warm . They should be in here  | by the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and called : " Mattie ! Bring the children in . " Armajewel Suggs came in , carrying the youngest child . Annabel herded the others in behind her . " Where is your sister ? " Joseph demanded of Armajewel . " She should be here . The funeral 's been over two hours . It 's getting night . Where is she ? " " Well , Cousin Joseph ? " began Armajewel . " What 's that ? " snapped Joseph . Armajewel batted her eyes and backed away . Annabel giggled . " Grandpa , " she explained , " took Cousin Mattie to Whitley to marry her  --  that makes her our cousin . And Cousin Armajewel is Cousin Mattie 's sister " " What ? " roared Joseph . " What did you say ? Armajewel ! What sort of nonsense is this child babbling ? " " Hit 's the God 's blessed truth , Cousin Joseph , " Armajewel told him . " Brother Voss and Mattie air gittin ' married . I reckon that sort of makes us all kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Joseph dropped into a chair . He was dazed . Annie said , " Oh dear , oh dear ! " The quiet peacefulness at The Cedars quickly revived Wash from the shock he suffered with the death of his wife . When he arrived he was dazed , and not more than half conscious of the movement around him . But Demetra 's soft , low voice soothed and comforted , and Richard 's manner of talking to him as though he were  | the most important man in the country pulled him from his despondency . He liked Renshaw and Margaret , too . The Blounts , with their son Richard , stopped over from the funeral to spend the night with the Whitings . Young Richard and his young cousin , Forrest , romped and played all over the house , but somehow their rompings did not seem boisterous . The entire household appeared to go along with unstudied orderliness . " I 've heard about you and your brother for a long time , " Wash told Renshaw . " I have been planning for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you all were up to . I understand you 've got quite a place down there . " " We cover a heap of territory , " admitted Shaw . " Walker is in Memphis , now , trying to spread out the business . " " You mean , " corrected Demetra , " that my sister is in Memphis putting her boy through school , and your brother tagged along , just to make it look businesslike . " They laughed . Wash chuckled politely , but it was not until Margaret explained , that he got the point of the joke . " Ophelia , " she explained , " always went about hankering for the quiet of the country . She could n't stand the cities , she said . But as soon as her boy got to school age , she managed to get Walker convinced that Memphis was the only place for him to carry on his  | end of the business , and at the same time she put her boy in Barlow 's Academy . " " By the way , Demetra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about concluded that our boy is growing up wild ? " " He is not , " interrupted Margaret . " I 've been teaching him . But he does need the companionship of other white children , and some formal instruction would help . What Shaw was fixing to say is this : we have about decided to loan him to you all for the rest of the winter so he can go to school over here , with Forrest . " " Splendid ! " exclaimed Demetra . " He and Forrest will have a grand time playing together , and we do really have a very good school . Brother Voss is such a capable , understanding man ! " " I know that fellow , " Renshaw frowned . " I have seen him somewhere . I got a glimpse of him today that reminded me of something , and I ca n't just recollect what . Where 's he from , originally , Mr. Goodner ? " " Pennsylvania , " said Wash . " Dutch . But he left that part of the country when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuit rider all over the country , from the Ohio River to Mobile , Alabama . " " I 've seen him somewhere , " Renshaw insisted . " But I ca n't recollect . " The second day at The Cedars , Wash and Richard had a long talk about Wash 's future . " I do n't know exactly what he 's got in mind , " explained Richard , " but that fellow Voss told me he was  | making arrangements so you would n't have to live with your brother . I think it 's a good idea , too . You know , too many of the same family under one roof . " " Joe , " Wash said , " is stern and hard , but he means for the best . " " I 'm sure he does , " Richard agreed . " But if I were you I 'd keep my affairs as independent of him as I could . You 've got a fine place . With a few improvements , and some careful figuring , you could make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the county . " " Yes , " said Wash , " I 've been planning on that for a long time . I 've considered and schemed " He stopped suddenly . He realized that he had n't thought of it before Richard put the idea in his mind . And just now he did n't think it quite right to start lying to Richard . " As a matter of fact , " he revised , " I 'm not a careful farmer , as Joe is , and I 'm not a good planner . I 'm not much of anything  --  wasted and ground down . " " Get out , man ! " laughed Richard . " I need you to help me run this county . You ca n't lay down on me , like that , and leave me in a jam , just when I 'm depending on you . " Richard was thinking rapidly , trying to figure out some way in which he could give Wash a sense of importance . " Why , " protested Wash , " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " In the first place , " Richard said , " when Mount Enon gets into the Conference , the best we can get is preaching on the second and fourth Sundays in each  | month . We 've got to have an exhorter over at the church to hold things together , and to help out the preacher  --  somebody who knows the community and who is known and respected . You fill that ticket just about right . " " But I 'm not a preacher , " protested Wash . " I never prayed in public in my life . I do n't know " " Brother Voss can teach you , " Richard told him . " Brother Voss could be the exhorter , " Wash suggested . " Too old , " declared Richard . " This community needs life . It needs dash and spirit  --  the same kind of dash and spirit that won Malvern Hill . And say , there 's another job you 've got to help me along with . The boys about the county are organizing a veterans ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they have their heads set on it , so the next best thing is to get a good man at the head of the outfit . You about fill that ticket , too . " Wash shook his head . He blinked his eyes in a vain effort to withhold tears . " Squire , " he said , " I was a scalawag . I never fired a shot and I never wore a uniform . I hid out ? " Richard looked at Wash and grinned . " I had that figured out , too , " he admitted . " The minute I talked to Joseph I knew he had something to cover up , and since he was moving into the county I figured it might be interesting to know what . So I wrote a letter to  | Chancellor Archibald Jones , whose son I knew , and got his whole history . " " Joe , " said Wash , sadly , " would curl up like a tobacco worm if he knew that . " " He 'll never know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without knowing . Joe is a big man in his way , and we need him in the county . The only thing I 've got to worry about is that Shaw Blount might remember where he saw Voss . " " I wondered about that , too , " said Wash . " Where do you reckon he saw him ? " " Only one place he could have , the way I figure it , " Richard said . " He saw him in Pulaski County , where you all came from . Shaw and Percy Jones came riding into camp one day , with some provender they had foraged from a preacher and his daughter who were living in a log house about a quarter off the pike . That would be Voss and Mrs. Goodner . There were supposed to be two brothers of conscript age hiding at the preacher 's house . The men were , I gather , you and Joseph . " " That 's right , " Wash admitted . " I recollect the raid . Joseph and I were in the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two soldiers made that raid . Joe was behind a stump , and I was up a dogwood tree . I recollect it as if it were yesterday . " Wash recaptured the incident in his mind , and he studied over it . " Say , just for the sake of curiosity , " he asked , suddenly , " will you find out something for me , from Mr.  | Blount ? After that raid he came back with the whole outfit  --  must have been a hundred or more I reckon , and surrounded the house so suddenly that Joe and I could n't get away . So we hid in the loft and waited . But they never got there . We saw them charging up the road toward the house and swirling all over the field , and in the rear and everywhere , and we figured we just made the loft in time . It was hot and frightening up there , sprawled out on a beam , wondering if they were going to burn the house down , or break it up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must have stayed up there an hour . I 'll bet I aged ten years , just waiting . " Richard laughed . " I was in that party , " he confessed . " There were only five of us , and we were dead set on capturing two scalawags , too . But more important things came to our notice . In fact , it was a wagon train of Yankee supplies , trying to make it through from one pike to the other . " " You say there were n't but five of you boys ? " demanded Wash . " I 'd have staked my life that there were a hundred . " " The Yankees , " explained Richard , " must have thought there were that many of us , too . We had a very successful time of it . " Wash shook his head with incredulity . " Well , I 'll be dog ! " he exclaimed , softly . " So you see , " Richard went on , " why I want you as  | commander of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't , " admitted Wash . " I 'm not a veteran and " " War veterans , " said Richard , " are apt to forget that the war is over . Already there has been some pretty rank lawlessness in some sections , and , I gather , the outrages were committed by bands of veterans who decided things were n't going to suit them . We do n't want that in Phinizy County , and we 're not going to have it . We 've got law courts , a jail , and a gallows , and we do n't need mob help in running things . Now , understand , some of the finest young men in the county are going in to this veterans ' organization , but even fine young men are liable to lose their judgment when they get to riding about the country at night , whooping and going on . I want you to make it your business to keep these boys in check . " " I 'm not even eligible to join , " protested Wash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " insisted Richard . " Anybody that can charge Malvern Hill the way the boys say you charged it , ought to be , and no doubt will be , the commander of the whole outfit . I 'll arrange the details , and have you elected , as soon as the organization is effected . " " Malvern Hill , " said Wash , gloomily . " I wonder where it is ? "  | Chapter Fifteen W HEN WALT AND JESSIE KATE RETURNED FROM ARKANSAS , LITTLE BAS THOUGHT IT BEST FOR Walt to change his name . " Moss Hall " was the name decided on , that late spring evening , and Moss Hall was the name that he lived and died by , on Hoop Pole Ridge . Arkansas had been a reality , instead of the purplish blue mirage that he had seen in the distance . There were plenty of land and plenty of timber , and Jessie Kate proved to be a woman with " git-up-and-git , " but there was something lacking . It had taken just four years for Walt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chains . " We 'll go back to Hoop Pole , " Jessie Kate decided , and they went . They walked from the Ashport ferry six miles to the Ridge settlement . They were barefooted , and owned nothing but the clothes they were wearing . But Jessie Kate was not in the least embarrassed . She led her man to Little Bas ' house and called the leader of the clan to the door .  | " We air back , " she announced , briefly . " Walt run aground . " " Well , " said Little Bas , cordially , " I air plum glad to see you . I figgered you 'd git back , a year ago . I figgered Walt would run aground in three years . But he helt on longer'n I thought . Little better man nor I thought you was , Walt . Come in and rest . I 'll git the nigger to dish up some victuals . " While Walt and Jessie Kate were eating , Little Bas related the news of the community . Things were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought and set up a cotton-gin , and Walt could run it , seeing as he was handy about such things . Bas was " sick and tired of ginning at the Blount mill ; if a man had druther hire niggers instid of white men , ' y God , he could let the niggers raise all the cotton he ginned , too . " And taxes had been bad since the new Trustee got in office . " Old Joe Goodner , ' y God , will assess the very slats on your bed , and collect , ' y God ! " It was the blamedest thing Little Bas had ever seen , the way that fellow Goodner found out about a man 's business , and then taxed the daylights out of it . If things kept up , Little Bas would have to take some of the boys over and burn his danged house down . " And that puts me in mind , " he continued , " your old wife is kin to ' em , now . She married Goodner 's daddy-in-law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their husbands and their young'uns , go  | about callin ' him Cousin Joseph . Hit fair hacks the hell outn him , ' y God ! " And so Walter Kincaid , who was believed by most people to have been drowned in the river , was received into the Hoop Pole Ridge clan . Walt , now Moss , accepted a house and a plot of ground . He planted a crop , and went about his work with the rest of the clan . For the most part , he liked it . Bas Younger was " clever , " and he " favored " Walt and his wife , showing them many attentions that other members of the clan failed to receive . And because Moss was a favorite with the chief of the clan , he became a favorite with the members . Then , too , there never was that necessity for thinking and planning for himself , a process which had tired and confused him during his stay in Arkansas . All a man had to do was work and do like Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . But there were moments  --  periods which he seldom shared even with his Jessie Kate  --  when Moss Hall resented it . He hated the idea of " knuckling under . " " I 'm free , white , and twenty-one , " he told himself , " and hit air a God-blamed outrage for a white man to git bossed around like I do . " The negroes irked Moss , too . Shaw Blount hired nothing but blacks at his mill and in his fields . Not that Moss , himself , had any desire to work for Shaw Blount , the God-blamed nigger-lover . But it was a danged shame for a nigger to work and make wages ,  | same as a white man . Even Little Bas had a nigger woman helping out his old woman , in the house . " Things must be powerful quar , " he confided to Jessie Kate , " when a man 's woman gits so high and mighty that she ca n't do for her man about the house , without havin ' a nigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jessie Kate , " air big enough to mind his own business . And so far as I know , he ai n't asked you to help . You 'd best forgit about things that do n't concern ye . " " I reckon ye 're right , " Moss agreed . He laughed . " Leastways , I remember how good them victuals tasted last spring when we come up , barefoot and hungry . Yep . Little Bas ' ways might not be my ways , but ' y grabs , he does git along . " The negroes bothered Moss more than anything else . Every day he could see them walk right into the store , and buy things with real money , and walk out as big as you please . It was n't right . " Here I work hard and strive , " he told himself , " ever ' day of my life , and here them niggers walk right in the store and spend cash money , like they 's good as I am . Or better , dad gum ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his field , plowing while Jessie Kate chopped in the cotton . Occasionally Jessie Kate would take a turn with the plow . " Why , dad blame hit , honey , " he told her , you kin plow good as I can ! "  | " Shore , I can , " said Jessie Kate . " I made a crop of my own the year before I took up with ye . " About the middle of June , the black woman who " helped out " at Little Bas ' house , took a few days off and had a baby . The baby , Moss learned , was a mulatto . Moss was indignant about it , but he was cautious , too . He would , he decided , go over and " beat hell outn her , " himself . Or he might burn her house down . He could n't make up his mind , for certain sure , what would be the best thing to do . Before he came to a decision , he was given a summons to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting was held in the gin-house , and Little Bas presided . It was the first meeting that Moss had attended , but he understood perfectly that " the boys " were White Caps , and the object of the meeting was to arrange some kind of demonstration . " We ai n't whupped a nigger since ' way last spring , " Little Bas announced . " But , now that the crops air about all laid by , and June ' teenth is approachin ' , what y'all say we git out and warm some nigger 's hide for him ? The excitement will do us all good . " " Hit 'll do the niggers good , too , " seconded Moss . " They air gittin ' so danged biggity that a white man ca n't hardly stay in the road . " " That air the God 's truth , " put in Will Younger . " I was drivin ' down under the bluff , t' other day , and a God-danged nigger was passin ' me , on the hill . He danged nigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gittin '  | so a white man ca n't drive down the road without a nigger might ' nigh runnin ' over him . " " I take hit , " announced Little Bas , " that hit air the senti-mints of thisyere gatherin ' that we whup hell outn some nigger ? " A chorus confirmed the statement . " Well , " continued Little Bas , " the next question air , what nigger air we gonter honor by beatin ' hell outn him ? " " That nigger that run into me , " Will Younger nominated . " That nigger woman that had the bright baby , " Moss suggested . " Steady , " ordered Little Bas . " Now , Will , do you know who that nigger air ? " " Shore , " declared Will . " He air named Johnnie Helium . He drives for Shaw Blount . He lives in a shanty , about a mile down the river road from the mill . Him and his wife and four or five kids . We c 'd whup hell outn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That nigger woman , " insisted Moss , " sleepin " round with a white man ! ' Y God ! she needs a whuppin ' worse ' n anybody I know . " " Let 's whup ' em both , " Ed Younger suggested , by way of compromise . " Now , jest hold yo ' hosses , " commanded Little Bas . " I 'm runnin ' this shindig , and do n't nobody forgit hit . " Silence fell over the group . Moss felt his " gall risin ' , " but he said nothing .  | " I 'll decide who 's gonter get whupped and who ai n't , " went on Little Bas . " Everybody agreed ? " A chorus of " Shore , Little Bas , " and " Hit suits us , " followed , and Little Bas dropped his stern attitude . " Now , Moss , " he said , jocularly , " if we was to whup that nigger woman for havin ' a bright baby , whar 'd we git to ? We 'd jest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ridge were a nigger-humper . ' Cause you know that nigger woman did n't have that bright baby without a little help . " Roars of laughter rewarded the chief for his humor . " ' Y God ! Little Bas shore is a curiosity ! " exclaimed Will . Moss was not amused . He resented being laughed at when he was so serious . " Then we ought to whip the white man , too , " he declared . " The daddy of that baby ai n't no better'n a nigger ? " Little Bas turned on him with sudden ferocity . " Shet your mouth , " he ordered , " and keep hit shet . " Moss lost his head . " I 'm free , white , and twentyone , " he declared , heatedly , " and I 'll say what I danged please ! I say the daddy of that baby ought to be whupped and run off the Ridge . " There was a tense silence . Moss realized immediately that he had said either too much or too little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every man present had , at some time or other , been galled by Little Bas ' summary manner , and his only hope lay in heading an open rebellion . Blindly he plunged to it .  | " That nigger woman , " he accused , " hangs around your house , and you 're most likely the daddy of that bright skin . That 's how come you do n't want nobody a-beatin ' of hit 's mammy ! " He stood quivering with excitement and fear . Cold sweat popped out on his forehead and his knees shook . He stood helpless and unable to move when he saw Little Bas draw a long pistol from his coat-tail pocket . The bullet struck Moss above the bridge of his nose . Not a word was spoken by the assembled hoodlums as the body of Moss Hall , formerly Walter Kincaid , favored son-in-law of Old Tip Abercrombie , folded and dropped in a limp heap to the gin-house floor . When the body stopped quivering , Little Bas pocketed his pistol . " Clear out ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " After the gaping hole in Moss ' head stopped bleeding , Little Bas ordered Will and Ed to take the body to the store , where , under Little Bas ' directions , it was propped in a standing position against a counter . Then Little Bas took his shotgun , and standing a few feet away , sent a charge of buckshot into the pistol wound . The charge tore off the whole top of the dead man 's head . " Will , " he instructed , " you go tell Jessie Kate to put on her shoes and Sunday dress . Tell her Moss is dead . Ed , you git Johnny busy makin ' a coffin , and then you 192  | hook a pair of mules to a waggin . Me and you and Will and Jessie Kate air goin ' to Whitley . " A little after midnight the wagon was stopped in front of the Phinizy County jail . " Yi  --  Lusker ! Shariff ! " Little Bas roared . The sheriff came to the front of the jail presently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lantern in his hand . " This air Bascomb Younger , from Hoop Pole , " he called . " I come to surrender . I jest kilt a man ! " The sheriff rubbed his eyes and shook his head . " Well ? " he asked . " You tell him , Will , " Little Bas commanded . Will Younger held up his right hand . " I swear before God A'mighty and on the Holy Bible , " he stated , " that Bascomb Younger kilt Moss Hall in self-defense . Moss was drinkin ' hard , and he come to the store , full of fight . He 'd been grumblin ' about how tight Little Bas were with credit for him and Jessie Kate . I did n't hear hit all , but I did hear him say , God damn you , I 'll kill you ! ' And I seen him grab up a ax and run at Little Bass with hit . Little Bas run back and got his shotgun and kilt him . So help me , God ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before God A'mighty and on the Holy Bible , " he said , " that I seen the whole thing and that air the way she was . Only , before Moss grabbed the ax , Little Bas had begged him to go on home and git sober , and then come back and talk it over , sensible . "  | Jessie Kate raised her hand and swore . " Moss , " she stated , " had been drinkin ' hard might ' nigh all summer . And the drunker he got , the more he fretted about Little Bas . Little Bas would n't sell him no more whisky on a credit , and Moss was hurt and indignated about hit . This mornin ' he got purty drunk and done a heap er loose talkin ' . I do n't recollect all he said , but I do mind him sayin ' , I ' 11 go up to the store and I 'll make that old son-of-a-bitch limber up , or I 'll beat his brains out with a club : " The sheriff whistled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ever came off Hoop Pole Ridge , " he declared . " I 'll lay it before the grand jury and let them worry about it . In the meantime , consider yourself under arrest and in custody . Do n't leave the county without an order from the court , until the grand jury acts . Good night . " The sheriff went back into the jail . Little Bas turned the wagon on a nimbus and started back down the road toward Hoop Pole . " ' Y God ! " he said , " he acted like he doubted my word . "  | Chapter Sixteen T HE FIELDS NEEDED RAIN . WASH DECIDED THAT AS HE RODE THROUGH A PATCH OF COTTON IN WHICH Roy Patton and Caleb Kincaid were plowing . The crop looked pale and half starved , in spite of the fact that the crab grass was a lusty green . " I might hold a prayer service , " Wash thought . " I reckon everybody needs a little rain . " He looked across the fence into the field of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and greener . " Everybody except Joe , " he amended . " Joe seems to get along whether it rains or not . " He recalled that his own field had been planted about the same time as Joseph 's , and that both fields were equally fertile . Yet , Joseph 's crop looked much better , and would , Wash knew , yield more . The fact that Joseph 's field had been plowed more thoroughly and more often than his did not occur to Wash . " You , Caleb ! " he shouted . " Do n't plow up that cotton ! Hog-gone it ! Plow the grass  --  not the cotton ! Roy , you pay attention to Caleb , now , and keep him in the middles. "  | " Aw , Cousin Wash , " protested Roy , " I ca n't do no more with Caleb than you kin . He jest ai n't got his mind on plowin ' today . " " He ai n't got his mind on anything , " declared Wash . " Caleb , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roy , do n't you let him chop up that cotton . " He watched Caleb unhitch the mule , and then he rode down the furrow behind Roy . Roy , he decided , was a fairly good plow hand , careful and steady , just what was needed for young cotton . His mule stepped a little rapidly for the careful work , but Roy was quiet and steady , and did n't excite the mule . That was the way to handle a peart mule , too . Ten feet from the end of the row , the mule stopped , and began turning about . Roy began setting his plow over for the next furrow . " What 're you turning there for , Roy ? " demanded Wash . " Put that mule clear to the end of the row . " " Whoa , " commanded Roy . " Why n't you make that mule go to the end of the row , man ? " Wash insisted . " Do n't let her turn in the middle of the field . " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared . " Drive her there . Hog-gone it ! you 've got lines ! " " I 'll tell you right now , Cousin Wash , she wo n't wade through them briers and across that ditch . " " Yes , she will , " Wash insisted . " I 'll be hog-gone if I 'll have that kind of plowing . Put that mule out to the end of the row , I tell you . "  | " Git up , Pat , " said Roy , timidly . The mule raised her ears and started turning again . " Whoa , " said Roy . " Hit her with the line , " ordered Wash . " Hold her down the middle and rap her with the line . " " I 'll tell you right now , Cousin Wash , " said Roy , " she wo n't stand it . " " Yes , she will ! " yelled Wash . " You hold her ! " He rode up and slapped the mule across the rump with his bridle reins . The mule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worm rail fence , dragging the plow after her . Roy followed the plow to the briers , and turned it loose . He stood up , shivering with fright . " By rigger ! " he exclaimed . " Catch that mule and plow her , " Wash ordered . " Between sorry plowing and dry weather , no wonder this cotton is about to burn up . " He rode off across the field . His life , he decided , had been uncommonly hard . No plow hands , and no rain . The Lord was trying him , perhaps , like Job . Here in the field next to his , John Ed Suggs was plowing . John Ed was Roy 's brother-in-law , and not a bit better man , yet John Ed was plowing correctly , and Roy was not even putting his mule to the end of the row . And Joseph 's crop was rank green , while Wash 's was plain sorry . " If I could just get a rain , " he decided . " It 's a trial by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " He felt martyrdom 's weight , and he raised his shoulders , soldier-like , to bear the burden . Maybe a song would help ,  | too . He sang in a clear tenor , the song which he thought fitted the occasion : " Like the Israelites , we 're pressing To that Canaan of peace and resting , But that Canaan to which we 're going Is far more blessed , far more blessed . Oh , this strife of earthly notions Can not quiet the soul 's emotions And we 'll ever press on , obeying that Blessed command , that blessed command . " He looked skyward . There was a sizable-looking thundercloud toward the southwest . Probably it was the Lord 's signal of recognition . He launched into the chorus : " Oh , that home , that beautiful home Over on that shore , that evergreen shore . There we 'll sing , with the ransomed we 'll sing Around the great throne of the Saviour and King And our Saviour , the crucified Saviour We 'll ever adore , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph could raise a bigger crop than he could . Probably Joseph could get better work out of his hired hands than he could . But could Joseph sing up a thundercloud with just one verse and chorus of a song ? He could not . Wash sang again : " Who will follow Jesus ? Who will make reply ? I am on the Lord 's side ! Master , here am I ! " The cloud spread . A breeze sprang up . Wash urged  | his horse into a trot toward the barn . The wind got higher , and a few drops of rain fell . The horse galloped . By the time Wash got to the lot , a brisk shower was falling . He leaped to the ground and opened the lot gate , and the horse trotted into the barn . But before Wash could get the gate closed , a yearling calf , perverse in the ways of calves , bolted and ran out of the lot into the field . Wash spent all of two minutes in the rain , chasing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse and hurried to the house to change into dry clothing . The rain continued steadily . Wash felt a proprietorship in every drop that fell . Of course , the Lord had sent it , but it was upon Wash 's own personal supplications that it had been sent . Brother Voss was reading . Wash hoped that he would comment on the wonders of the rain so the real truth of the matter could be placed before the old preacher . " Quite a shower , " Wash suggested , hopefully . " Yes , " agreed Brother Voss . " These little June thundershowers hurt the crops more than they help . Cotton and corn do n't need them , and they make the crab grass grow like all-get-out . " Wash was disappointed and indignant . He resaddled his horse and rode over to the store , where , he knew , he would find a number of farmers who had been driven out of their fields by the shower , loafing and talking of the doings about the community .  | " Have any rain over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as he came into the store . Wash looked about . Sure enough , there were at least a dozen men , sitting on boxes and counters , just inside the store . It looked like a good audience . " Rain ! " he exclaimed . " Why , hog-gone it , man , it was a regular cloudburst over at my place ! Rain , you say ? Why , it rained so hard it washed my cows out of the lot ! I lost eight head in that waterspout . Hoggone it , between these June floods and the Republican party , no wonder a man ca n't make a decent living ! ? Give me a plug of tobacco , Lafe , and let me be on my way . I have n't got time to tarry . " Lafe cut the tobacco . Wash hurried out in a state of high indignation . As soon as he mounted , it occurred to him that he had no place to go . He had expected to sit around the store and gossip with the neighbors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in such a position that staying longer at the store would not be appropriate . Anything that came up for discussion after his suddenly invented waterspout would be anticlimactic . You could n't expect a man so recently visited by the calamities of nature to sit around a store , could you ? Wash rode down the road , worried . He did not know what to do or where to go . He always enjoyed a chat with the Whitings , but Richard was in Whitley , attending to county business , and Demetra and Forrest  | were spending the summer in Middle Tennessee . He could , of course , go back home and watch Brother Voss read , or listen to Mattie fuss at Caleb . " I believe , " he said aloud , " I 'll ride over and see Joseph . " The decision was made casually , although Wash had vowed , nearly five years before , " never to set foot in Joseph 's house again . " He had talked with Joseph on occasion , when they met in neutral territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been in his brother 's home since the night Luella died . Something had come up  --  Wash had forgotten just what it was  --  and he made that vow . " Could n't have amounted to much , " he decided , " or I 'd have remembered what it was . " He rode up at an easy canter , hitched his horse to the post , and walked into the house , just as though he were accustomed to riding by every day or so . He walked into the living-room . Joseph was at a writing-table , by the window . Annie was reclining in an easy-chair . She was pregnant again , Wash noticed , with her tenth , or maybe her eleventh . Wash could n't remember . " Well , howdy , Joseph , " he greeted . " Howdy , Annie . " " Wash ! " exclaimed Annie . " Do come in ! " " Yes , come in , Wash , " parroted Joseph . " Well , it 's nice to have you over . Anything wrong ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wash . " Too wet to plow in the fields , so I thought I 'd come over and chat awhile . I 'm sorry , too . About the fields being wet , I mean . I 'm  | a little behind with the plowing . I did hope to get that field cleaned out before it rained again . But these June thundershowers  --  they hold the crops back and spur the crab grass on . " Joseph shifted in his chair . He felt ill at ease at his brother 's coming in , unheralded , after nearly five years . Joseph thought there should have been some sort of demonstration of forgiveness , or at least an explanation . It was n't at all like the Wash that Joseph had known , to walk in boldly , anywhere , and be in complete command of the situation . But there he was , as casual as you please . " I did notice a little grass in that field next to mine , " Joseph admitted . " But a careful hoeing , and some good plowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh yes , " stated Wash . " I 'll get it cleaned out next week , before the crop suffers . " There was a pause . Wash turned to Annie . " How 're all the children ? Well , I hope ? " " They 're all well right now , Wash , " Annie said . " But I 'm afraid the measles will break out , any time . Armajewel Suggs is so careless . She visited over on Cole Creek last week , and they say the measles are raging there . I did n't know a thing about it until she had been in the house a whole day , and of course it was too late , then . I do miss Annabel so much . She is such a help with the children . " " Where 's Annabel ? " asked Wash . " She 's visiting in Memphis , " Annie explained . " A  | girl in her class at Ward 's . You know she 's going to Ward 's , in Nashville ? Oh yes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Katie Bell Miller . She 's the daughter of a Doctor Miller ? " " Doctor Roy Miller , " put in Joseph , proudly . " You know , the famous surgeon ? " " Roy Miller ? " repeated Wash . " Hmm . Seems like I 've heard Dick speak of him . " " Heard who ? " asked Joseph . " Dick . Dick Whiting , " explained Wash . Joseph was crushed . Annie hurriedly changed the subject . " Annabel , " she said , " is quite a young lady , now . Nearly seventeen and so pretty and lovely . " " I 'll bet she is , " Wash agreed . " She gets that from her mother . " Annie glowed . Joseph decided he would have to speak , and he said the first thing that came into his mind . " I only hope , " he said , " that Annabel grows up to be the wonderful woman her mother is . " It surprised him as much as it did Annie . " Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " She was enormously pleased . " You and Wash , both , sitting here and paying me compliments ! Why I  --  I do n't know what to think ! " " It 's the truth , what I said , " Joseph stated , solemnly . " I 'm not as gifted with words as our brother , Annie , but you know , and I want Wash to know , that I think you are the finest woman that ever lived . "  | Annie cried , " Oh , Joseph , you are so wonderful ! " Joseph was flustered with embarrassment . " Go ahead and hug her , Joe , " urged Wash . " Why , hog-gone it , an ' she 's hungry for a little affection . " Joseph got up and put his arm around his wife . Under the circumstances , it required every particle of nerve and strength he had . But he did it , though awkwardly . Annie loved it . " We understand , do n't we , Joseph ? " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph . " I hope you do . " " Well , " said Wash , rising , " I 'll be getting along . I 've got a few things to attend to . " He walked toward the door , and there he stopped and turned . " Oh , yes , " he said . " You know Dick is facing a stiff fight , this fall , on the state debt question ? Hoop Pole is solid with the state-credit bunch , and Hatchie River is wavering . That outfit of Brownlow bond holders are sending money and speakers all over the state ? " Joseph got up . " I know that , Wash , " he said , " and you know I 'm with Squire Whiting on that issue . Tennessee is under no moral obligation to pay carpet-bag bonds " " We 've got to make a showing , " Wash interrupted . " I know , and you know , and every other sensible man knows . But it takes demonstrations to argue with a crowd . And the crowd does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wash , " agreed Joseph . " What 's on your mind ? "  | " A parade , " stated Wash . " The biggest parade ever held in Phinizy County . Everybody in uniform , with the old Stars and Bars waving and the band playing Dixie , ' and the boys giving the Rebel yell . Why , hoggone it , " Wash 's eyes blazed with anticipation , " we 'll sweep the county ! On one side will be Brownlow bonds and carpet-baggers ! Why , it 's a marvelous idea ! Hoggone ' em ! We 'll root ' em out of their nests and make ' em take to the open ! " Joseph laughed . " It sounds like a great parade , anyway , " he declared . " The veterans , no doubt , will enjoy it . " There was a hint of sarcasm in Joseph 's voice , but Wash did not notice it . " You are going to enjoy that parade , too , Joseph , " Wash continued . " That 's going to be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're going to march , and whoop and yell and charge , and wave a flag , and kiss the pretty girls . Why , Joseph , you 'll never be the same man " " I certainly would never be the same man , " said Joseph , sternly , " if I made such a fool of myself . Wash , what you do is strictly your own business , as I told you , long ago . If you wish to make a monkey of yourself  --  if you wish to lie and to compound that lie over and over again , every time you turn out those war veterans , that is your business . If you wish to buy gray uniforms and swords and brass buttons and medals , and , just because you can out-lie them , ride at the head of the men who really did fight in the war , that is  | your business . But do n't expect me to do any such ridiculous thing . I wo n't do it . " Wash was surprised ; he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What in the thunder is the matter with you ? " Joseph glared . " Not a thing the matter with me , " he said , positively . " I 'll support the Cancellationists because I believe they are right . I 'll support Squire Whiting because I believe he is a thoroughly honest and capable man who is doing valuable work for this county . But I wo n't join you in any such clownish dishonesty as that . " " But think , " insisted Wash . " Why , man , you 're County Trustee . You do n't think you were elected to that job because the people liked Joe Goodner , do you ? Why " I 'm very well aware of the fact that Squire Whiting put me in office , " said Joseph , crisply . " I know that I could n't have been elected without his endorsement . And I know that he gave me that endorsement , not on any pretense of personal friendship . He gave it to me because he knew I was the best man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he had known of a better one , I would n't be Trustee . Nor would I want to be Trustee if there were a better man for the place . " " But it will help , " pleaded Wash , " to have every county official in uniform . Everybody in the county knows you , and they respect you . They do n't particularly like you , but they admire the way you handle the  | business . And with you in the parade  --  why , you could be a private , and everybody would pick you out and admire you for it " Wash , " Joseph interrupted  --  his voice was low and deadly ? " I am at least an honest man . If I put on a uniform , no matter under what provocation , I would be telling a lie  --  lying to everybody in this county . I am not a veteran of the war " " Everybody assumes that you are , " challenged Wash , " and you never take the trouble to correct that impression . Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What people think , " he stated , " is their own business . Many years ago I had to make that decision . I decided that a man was not called upon to go around the country , shouting things about himself that few people cared about , anyway , in order to be an honest man . Your didos as the commander of the veterans in this county have not made it any easier for me . But I said nothing . You have constantly embarrassed me with your imagined battles and your strutting in uniform . If you could see for yourself how ridiculous you are , riding a horse at the head of that column , you would go off somewhere and hide . If your great friend , Dick Whiting , knew that while he had been fighting and facing death for a cause that he believed to be a just one , you were hiding from both armies , where would you and your parade be right now ? "  | Joseph was angry , clear through , and he rose , his beard shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolboy who has discovered a huge joke on his teacher . " Now , I 've got you , Joseph , " he chortled . " I 've got you , you might say , impaled to the walls of circumstance . " " You are talking like an idiot , " snapped Joseph . " If Dick Whiting knew , " Wash repeated , slowly , so that every word would fall upon his brother 's ears like a soft feather , tipped with a sharp pin ? " if Dick Whiting knew I hid out while he was fighting and facing death for a cause that he believed to be a just one ? where would me and my parade be , right now ? " He paused , and closed his eyes until they were narrow slits . " I would be right where I am , Joe Goodner , recruiting Confederate veterans for the parade that will sweep this county for the finest man that ever drew a breath . And when I say the finest man , I 'm talking about my good friend Dick Whiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " you 're a fool . I believe you 've lost your mind . " " Maybe I am a fool , " admitted Wash , " and maybe I have lost my mind . But that has nothing to do with it . Dick Whiting knows that I did n't fire a shot during the war . And he knows that you did n't . " " What ! " exclaimed Joseph . " You told him ? " " I started to tell him , " Wash said . " But he already knew it and he told me . Dick Whiting is n't only the  | finest man in the county . He 's the smartest man in this or any other county . He spotted you the minute he saw you . Joseph felt his knees getting weak . He sat down on the arm of Annie 's chair . " Great God ! " he exclaimed , " Annie has fainted ! Armajewel ! Andrew ! Bring some water ! ? Here , Wash , help me lift her to the bed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annie from the chair , and stretched her upon the bed . " You better git the doctor , Cousin Joseph , " advised Armajewel , and raising her voice she added , " and I think you 'd better git him quick ! " Joseph ran to the door . " John Ed ! " he called . " Yes , Cousin Joseph ? " John Ed answered from the barn . " Saddle my mare , " Joseph shouted . " Get Doctor Kinzer . Hurry up . Run her all the way there . She can stand it . " Wash sidled out of the room . " I 'll send Mattie over , " he told Joseph . " You get you a uniform and start practicing . You 're going to march in that parade , hog-gone you , and you 're going to whoop and shout , and wave a flag , and kiss the girls , and give the Rebel yell every time the band plays ' Dixie ' ! " He marched out of the house as though the whole Army of Northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and started off at a canter . He was  | happy . He was a warrior , victorious in battle , and he felt the Lord was entitled to some recognition for His part in the fray . He sang with a militant ring in his voice : " When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound And time shall be no more ; When the morning breaks , eternal , bright and fair , When the chosen ones shall gather over on that other shore And the roll is called , up yonder , I 'll be there . "  | Chapter Seventeen Y DUNG RICHARD BLOUNT PLANNED TO CLIMB DOWN FROM THE WAGON WITHOUT ANY ESPECIAL SHOW OF interest , and march alertly , but not too rapidly , to embrace his mother dutifully . He planned to say , " Howdy , Mother . I am happy to see you looking so well . " But it was n't like that , at all . When the wagon drove up in front of the house , he piled out and galloped to his mother . " Gosh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you ! " He hugged and kissed her a dozen times . " It 's good and homey-looking around here ! I 'm sure glad to see you . " " Why , what a tall boy you are ! " exclaimed Margaret . " I would n't have known you ! Here , stand back and let me look at you ! " She measured him with her eye . " You 're taller than your father , son ! How fine you look ! Now sit down while they bring your trunks in . There  --  where you 'll get the breeze. ? Nancy ! Bring some water from the spring ! And now tell me all about everything . How does Nashville look , and what you learned and what you did and ? "  | " Hold on ! " interrupted Richard . " General Humes says the first thing to remember is , take one point at a time . Now , Nashville looks  --  well , about the same as always , I reckon . Lots of brick houses and the state Capitol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lots of pretty houses in the edge of town , but all about the same . " " I see , " said Margaret . " You were n't very delighted with Nashville . " " I had a good time , I reckon . " " And what did you learn ? " " We read Virgil and Thucydides in translation , and I learned how to survey . At least I think I did . General Humes can make a monkey out of a triangle . He 's awfully good in all sorts of mathematics . I did n't learn a heap , I do n't reckon . " " And your law ? " Richard blushed . " Well , you see , " he faltered , " law is supposed to come the second year . That is , you have to have Latin and mathematics and all , and then you 're supposed to " " Out with it , my lad , " urged Margaret . " Tell mother . You 're too big a boy to beat around the bush . Tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be all right . If not , we 'll discuss it further . " " Well , you see , Ma , " said Richard , doggedly , " I 'm not fixing to go back to school next fall . " " Oh , that 's it ? " asked Margaret . " It 's an idea , and no doubt you think it a good one . Last fall you were all  | impatience to begin reading law , and your father went to considerable trouble and expense getting you situated with General Humes . And now you do n't want to be a lawyer . " " Oh , no 'm , " Richard corrected . " I aim to be a lawyer , all right . But you see , I 've sort of changed my plans . Something has come up that makes me change my plans . " " I see , " said Margaret . " But do n't you think your father and I should know about it before they are changed ? " There was some condescension and not a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you all , " said Richard , " but I thought I 'd better talk it over with Pa , first . " Margaret laughed . " A sort of man-to-man discussion , I suppose ? " she asked . " Well , yes , sort of . " " That 's likely a good idea , " admitted Margaret , with mock seriousness , " but in the meantime do n't you think maybe if you told me about it , I might help you out with Pa ? Your father is a very busy man , you know , and he hates to have plans changed on him , without any notice . It might be a good idea for me to work on him first . " Richard considered . He knew his mother could help , if she wanted to . But in case she did n't want to , she could do a lot of damage to his cause . Week after week , for ten months Richard had seen a maxim of battle written on the blackboard in the General 's even  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind pictured one of these legends : " Never show the enemy your full strength until absolutely necessary . " Richard decided to send a scout and learn the temper of the enemy . " If you really could know , Ma , what a wonderful girl she is " Ah ! " exclaimed Margaret . " A girl ! Now , we have something to talk about . Tell me all about her . Where did you meet her , and what her name is , and everything . " " She 's Annabel Goodner , " said Richard . " You know , Squire Goodner 's daughter ? " " That child ! " laughed Margaret . " Why , she 's in pig-tails ! " " Now , Ma ! " objected Richard . " She 's a young lady , beautiful as a June rose and bubbling as a rock spring . " " You certainly have learned the words , " Margaret approved . " That 's from your father . My family , the Whitings , were always gallant enough , but a little too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the most casual voice , as though he were discussing the weather , and come out with a compliment that would make me ? but no matter . You seem to think you are in love with Squire Goodner 's daughter , and that is going to change your plans . I 'll want to know a heap more about the girl , and how you courted her . But at present , what are your plans ? " " We 're going to marry , " Richard explained , " and  | live in Whitley . I 'm going to read law in Judge Steelman 's office until I learn enough to go on my own . " Margaret thought for a minute . " It sounds very simple , my lad , " she told him . " Very simple . " She considered a moment . " Richard , " Margaret said , " you are just a baby ; you are too young , and the girl is too young , to think seriously about getting married . " " I 'm eighteen , " Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a baby . " " Annabel will be eighteen in August , " Richard went on . " We are n't going to marry until October , right after the fall term of court . " Margaret shook her head sadly . " Too young . Too young and tender , " she said . " You were n't but eighteen when you married , " Richard told her , suddenly . " We wo n't discuss that , " said Margaret . " Your father , at least , was more than eighteen . And he was better equipped to care for a young wife than you are . " " That 's what I want to talk to Pa about , " said Richard . Richard paced about restlessly as Margaret sat thinking . " Where 's Pa ? " Richard asked . " He 'll be along , soon , " Margaret told him . " We did n't expect you until around noon . " Richard looked across the fields . " I believe I 'll catch up a horse and ride out to meet him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porch steps .  | Margaret called him back . " I want to talk to you some more , " she said . " About Annabel . Now sit down . And tell me . Are you dead certain this is n't puppy love ? You remember you used to love every girl in this end of the county  --  one right after another . And as I remember , you and Squire Goodner 's daughter were always fussing ? " " This is genuine , " Richard said , fervently . " When I 'd sit in the parlor , Sunday afternoons , over at Ward 's , I could tell that I loved her and that she loved me . Of course we could n't discuss that , with all the others about . But we found ways to tell each other things . " " You love her just exactly as she is ? " Margaret asked . " Of course , Mother , " insisted Richard . " She 's the most wonderful ? " " And she loves you just as you are ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard . " There are some things she might want to change ? " " Yes , it 's serious , " admitted Margaret . " I 'll speak to your Pa for you . You 'd better let me break the subject to him . Now run along , lad . Your Pa is back in the new ground somewhere . " It was not until after supper that the subject was approached again . Margaret and Renshaw were in comfortable rocking-chairs on the porch , and their son was seated on the porch steps . " Our son , " said Margaret , " is fixing to get married . " " Splendid , " said Shaw . " He 's quite a youngster , and  | nothing makes a man grow up like getting married to a fine woman . Who is she , Dick ? " The approval of his father almost took Richard 's breath . " Annabel Goodner , " he said , as soon as he could talk . " Squire Goodner 's daughter . " " Goodner is a solid citizen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a daughter of marriageable age . But if he has , I reckon she 'll make you a good wife . Of course you 'll acquire a lot of kinfolks along with her , I believe . " Although his father 's words were spoken quietly , Richard felt a sting in his last statement . " Nearly everybody between Hoop Pole Ridge and the Forked Deer River claims kin with the Goodner 's , I believe , " Shaw added . " That 's a joke , " Richard explained . " You see ? " " Maybe , " said Shaw . " But if poor-white trash called me cousin , I 'd feel terribly embarrassed . Why , I heard that half-witted boy that hangs around Potter 's store calling Squire Goodner Cousin Joe , ' no longer ago than last week . " " What about that , Richard ? " Margaret asked . " When I talked with you , this morning , you did n't mention that . I supposed the Goodners were nice people . " " They are , Mother , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family that produced an idiot , " said Shaw . " There 's bad blood , somewhere down  | the line , when an idiot turns up , and you never can tell where it will crop out again . " " There is no idiot blood in the Goodner family , " declared Richard , positively . " Annabel told me all about it , and she thought it was very funny . I think so , too . " " An idiot , funny ? " asked Margaret . " It does n't seem funny to me . " " That idiot , " explained Richard , " is the son of a man named Kincaid . This man , Kincaid , used to work for Uncle Dick . His wife was a woman named Abercrombie , and she had eight sisters . And the whole pack of them are plain sorry , if you want my opinion . " " I remember Kincaid , " Shaw recalled . " He stole a log team from your uncle Dick , and ran off to Arkansas with a Hoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoop Pole and got murdered . I remember him . " " This idiot , " went on Richard , " is his son and the son of Mattie Abercrombie , who is the smartest one of that whole outfit . Then , when Brother Wash Goodner 's wife committed suicide , Brother Voss , who is Annabel 's grandpa , married Mattie Kincaid , so Brother Wash could have some kind of home . And all of Mattie 's relations and connections figured it would be pretty high-toned to claim kin with the Goodners . " " Oh , that 's the way it is ? " Shaw laughed . " Well , well . Why did this fellow Voss marry the Kincaid woman , you say ? " " To give Brother Wash Goodner a home . You see ,  | Brother Wash and Squire Joe never got along very well together . There was some kind of big fuss between Mrs. Wash Goodner and Squire Joe Goodner . Annabel does n't know what it was , but whatever it was , Squire Goodner came out the little end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot herself with a pistol , and Squire Joe tried to blame it on his brother , some way or other , and the upshot of the whole thing was , Brother Voss married Mattie Kincaid and Brother Wash went with them , so he would n't have to live with Squire Joe . And I think it was pretty fine of Brother Voss , too . " " Well , well , " said Renshaw , reflectively . " Brother Voss seems to be a fine old gentleman . And you know ? Damn it , Margaret , where have I seen that man , before ? " " Shaw , I do n't know , " said Margaret . " I wish I did know , so I could tell you and ease your mind . Why do n't you ask him ? You 've asked me ten thousand times . " " I never think about it when I 'm around him , " Shaw said . " I wish I could remember " Do the Goodners , " asked Margaret , " claim kin with Mattie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm , " he said . " Only Annabel does , when her Pa is around . Just to frazzle him . He hates it . " " Hmm , " said Margaret . " A young girl should have  | more respect for her parents than that . That is , if she were a nice young girl . " " Oh , she 's nice , all right , " said Richard , easily . " And she respects her parents as much as any young girl . But you do n't know Squire Goodner . Not like Annabel knows him , anyway . " " Richard ! " said Shaw , sternly . " Whatever your young lady 's attitude toward her father is is not my concern . But I will not have you , at your age , speaking disrespectfully about a grown man who stands in high esteem throughout this county . " " Yes , sir , " said Richard . " I think , " went on Shaw , " you 'd best tell your mother and me good-night , now . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed his mother , said good-night to his father , and retired . When he had gone , Shaw turned to his wife . " What do you make of it ? " he asked . " I 'm afraid it 's serious , " said Margaret . " I had so hoped that Richard would marry some girl who amounts to something  --  some family connection that can lift him along in life . " " I 'm not worried about that end of it , " said Shaw . " He 's got enough of your brains and breeding to get along in anybody 's world . And a good healthy body from me , to back that up . But he 's too young to get married . I want him to go to school . " " Yes , he 's too young , " admitted Margaret . " But he  | plans to keep up his studies . He wants to read law under Judge Steelman , after he 's married . " " That 's not such a bad idea , at that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather he would stay here and take over things from me when I get too old to manage . But he 's got his mind set on living in town , somewhere , and a man might as well live where he wants to . If he wants to read law with Judge Steelman , he could n't have picked out a finer man in the county to apprentice himself to . And if he wants to be a lawyer , why , I reckon there 's enough legal work in the county to support him , with a little help from home now and then . But I 'd hate like thunder for him to marry too young , or to a woman that would n't make him a good wife . " He stood up and began to walk back and forth on the porch . " I 'll tell you , Margaret , " he said . " We 've got to forget we 're his parents and look at this thing from a mature , disinterested viewpoint . " " But we are his parents , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " But we also are older , and I hope wiser in the ways of life , than he . We must give him our wisdom , now ; not our affection . There is a line , my dear , where parents should stop letting affection color judgment . Because he 's your son , I know you think there is n't a woman in the world good enough for him . And I feel the same way . I would n't be satisfied unless he found a woman as fine as the one I found , and , darling , there are no more like you ? "  | " Sit down , Shaw , " Margaret urged . " Now say that again ? " " Say what again ? " " Oh , nothing much , " said Margaret . just suddenly decided something . " " What was it ? " " That you 'll keep me loving you like a giddy schoolgirl until I 'm a hundred years old . Here we are , with a grown boy on our hands . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you were saying ? " " What was I saying ? " asked Shaw . " Nothing very important , I 'm afraid . We decided he was too young to get married , but we did n't decide what we were going to do about it , did we ? " " I believe not . " " And you think this really is serious with him ? " " It has all the indications . " " Very well , then , " said Shaw . " If it is serious , the best thing to do is to help him in every way we can . He 'll need plenty of help , and so will his girl . But I want to make absolutely dead certain that he is serious about it , first . " " I agree with you , " said Margaret . " But how do you intend to find out ? Of course , he thinks he 's serious . " Shaw stepped into the hall . " Oh , Dick , are you asleep ? " he called . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | " Put on a wrapper , " said Shaw , " and come out here . Your mother and I want to talk with you . " Richard appeared in a minute , wrapped in a light , loose robe . " Your mother and I have a proposition to make to you , " Shaw explained . " When are you planning to get married ? " " October , sometime , " said Richard . " It looks like that will suit Annabel best . " " July , August , and September , " his father counted . " I 'm going to give you an order on the bank for six hundred dollars . I want you to go off and spend that money any way you see fit . If you can make it last until the first of October , well and good . If not , it will be all right . In either case , I want you to spend every cent of it  --  foolishly .

" Richard pondered . " I ought to get word to her some way , " he explained , " so she wo n't think " I think that is a fair condition , " said Margaret . " May n't he let her know what he 's up to ? " " That 's agreed , " said Shaw .  | " In case I should meet her accidentally ? " queried Richard . " That ca n't be helped , " said Shaw . " I shall expect you to act the gentleman that you are , if you meet her .

" " If you still want to marry her , your mother and I will be glad to receive her as our daughter , " his father promised . " It 's a bargain , " agreed Richard .  | Chapter Eighteen THE TOWN OF WHITLEY WAS OLD BEFORE PHINIZY COUNTY CAME INTO BEING . IN I692 , WHEN THE state of Tennessee was a part of the Carolina wilderness , and Carolina was but a colony of the English king , a trader named Doherty wrote of seeing a " settlement of a dozen or more houses located in the wilderness , miles from the river . " The thing about the settlement that interested Trader Doherty most was a sign painted across the side of one of the buildings : WHITLEY : THE FASTEST GROWING TOWN WEST OF THE MOUNTAINS . Nearly two centuries had passed between the time Trader Doherty first saw the town , and the time young Richard discovered it . The years had wrought some change . Instead of " a dozen or more houses " there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides of the square . A railroad ran two miles away and there were some eight hundred people living within the corporate limits . Richard had come to Whitley to begin the three  | months of dissipation his father had planned for him . He had drawn six hundred dollars from the bank and was looking about for some excitement . He expected to go to Memphis before the three months were up , but he wanted to start his wild career in Whitley . He liked Whitley . There were people and life there . From where he was standing he could see all the big men in the county going into or coming out of the courthouse . He could see Henry Solomon 's saloon , where everybody , sooner or later , went , and where , it was said , most of the county 's business was actually transacted . And there was the office of the Phinizy County Enterprise , whose editor had been run out of town for accepting money from the Brownlow bond crowd for supporting the so-called " state credit " party . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white letters , ran the sign : WHITLEY : THE FASTEST GROWING TOWN IN WEST TENNESSEE . Richard smiled . " I hope it does n't grow too fast , " he said . " Not get so big as Nashville , anyway . " Nashville had worried young Richard . There were too many people . He liked people , and he enjoyed seeing them go about their business . But he wanted to know them , and to know their business . Strangers , hurrying on unknown errands , confused him . He wanted to know , or at least to be able to guess intelligently , what they were about . Down the road he saw old man Reub Pillow riding toward town on his mule . He knew that the three Pil-  | low sons were riding at hundred-yard intervals behind the old man , and that they had ridden that way since they left Forked Deer , early that morning . He knew that old man Reub would buy a jug of whisky , and sit on the curb in front of the courthouse , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eat cheese and crackers , and then ride home , without once saying a word to one another . The door of Solomon 's saloon swung open and Little Bas Younger came out . He had been drinking , but he walked steadily . " There will be a fight , " predicted Richard . " I wonder who ? " The chief of Hoop Pole Ridge made straight for the courthouse lawn and for Squire Goodner , who was standing in a group , talking county business . Little Bas was more than six feet tall , and weighed two hundred and twenty-five pounds . Squire Goodner was of medium height and build . " I hope Little Bas does him up good , " grinned Richard . " He 's so damned smug . " The fight got under way with a few preliminaries . There were words , but they were fighting words . " You run my taxes up , " accused Bas . " You built a three-thousand dollar gin on your place , " said Joseph , quietly . " Naturally your taxes went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stand for that kind of doin 's , "  | Little Bas stated , adding an observation on Joseph 's ancestry . Joseph yanked a horse pistol from his coattail , caught it by the barrel , and slugged Little Bas on the temple with the butt of it . The Hoop Pole Ridge chief crumpled into a limp pile on the ground . A crowd gathered . The sheriff looked worried . " He might die , " the sheriff said . " That might be assault to kill , Squire . You should have used your fists . " " He 's a fool if he thought I was going to knock with him , " Joseph said . " And he wo n't die , Sheriff . If I 'd wanted to kill him I 'd have shot him . " " Well , " said the sheriff , " it 's a good point to bring out in case the old bastard does die . They certainly ca n't prove intent to kill . Tote him over to the saloon , boys , and let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Squire , mind out for the rest of that Hoop Pole bunch . They 're hard citizens , down that way . " " I can use the other end of this pistol , if necessary , " said Joseph . Young Richard was perplexed . The suddenness of the fight , and the cool manner in which Joseph had handled himself , aroused his admiration . There , he decided , was a real man . And yet there was something about Joseph that repelled . He wandered into the courthouse , and into the office of the county judge . " Uncle Dick , " he asked , " what sort of a man is Squire Joe Goodner ? "  | " Well , " said Richard , " that is a pretty big order . In what way ? " " Do you like him ? " asked his nephew and namesake . " That , also , is quite an order . He 's the best Trustee this county ever had . He 's honest and he 's efficient . He is n't sociable , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother Wash . In fact , he 's a pretty stern citizen . Does that answer your question ? " " Yes , sir , " grinned Richard . " You do n't like him . Neither do I. " His uncle laughed . " As a matter of fact , son , " he said , " I do like him . And so do you , I believe . Or you would n't have brought up the subject . " " I just saw him slug Little Bas Younger with the butt of his pistol . " " Whew ! " exclaimed the elder Richard . " Did he do a good job of it ? " " Pretty good , I reckon , " said the boy . " They toted Little Bas off . The argument was something about taxes . " " I know , " explained Richard . " Little Bas has been aching about those taxes all summer . I 'm glad he finally got up the brass to hop Joseph about them . Otherwise he might have been shot from behind , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . He 's not near the man his old daddy was . " The boy was alarmed . " You do n't reckon he 'll do anything like that , now , do you ? " he asked .  | " No , " said Richard . " He got the whole thing off his chest , I imagine . It took three months for him to build up enough brass to do what he did , and Joseph let him down so quickly and so thoroughly that I imagine Bas will go home and behave himself for a while . By the way , how do you happen to be so interested in Squire Goodner ? It could n't be Miss Annabel , could it ? " Richard confided the whole story to his uncle . " It 's a good idea , " the man agreed . " The outing wo n't hurt you , if you take care of your health , and Miss Annabel will be just that much sweeter and prettier when you get back . Now , if I were you , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good friend there , Dr. Roy Miller . I 'll give you a letter to him . And of course your uncle Walker and aunt Ophelia will want to see you . But I would n't stay around kinfolks too closely . Get out and see life . Then , it would be nice to go down the river to New Orleans , too . We have friends there , also . Caswell Moore . He will be glad to see Shaw Blount 's son . It sounds like a fine outing . Keep in touch with me by an occasional letter , and if the money your Pa allowed you runs short , let me know . I 'll see what I can do about it . " When young Richard got back to the courthouse lawn , Reub Pillow and his boys were sitting on the curb . A half-gallon jug of whisky was being passed , but instead of cheese and crackers , they were eating tinned sardines . It was an innovation that caused Rich-  | and to speculate . " Why , " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheese ? " From his earliest boyhood he had heard of and had seen the Reub Pillow family drinking whisky and eating cheese and crackers . He found himself resenting the tinned sardines . He felt as if something extraordinary had happened to him personally . Edging nearer to the Pillows , he watched them more closely . Old man Reub would take a cracker and scoop a sardine from the can , and eat it . Then he would take a swallow of whisky from the jug . Cornelius , the oldest boy , would take the tin of fish and the jug of whisky , and do exactly as his father had done . The fish and the jug would be passed to Johnny , who would repeat the process , and finally to Ashley . Wonder of wonders ! They were talking . " Dash some whisky on them fish , " suggested Ashley , " and they wo n't taste so blamed fishy . " " Do n't talk so blamed much , " ordered the father . " Folks 'll think you ai n't had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the co'tehouse squar ' like that . Pass me them fish . " There was silence again . Richard walked by and spoke . " Howdy , Mr. Pillow , " he said . " Howdy , boys ! " " Howdy , Richard , " said Reub . " Howdy , " chorused the boys . " How are the crops down your way ? " Richard asked . " Fair , " said Reub . " Here , " he proffered the sardines  | and crackers . " Have some dinner with us ? Reckon you 're too young for the whisky . Yer daddy might not like hit if I was to give you whisky , but you 're welcome to the fish . " " No , thank you , " said Richard . " I 'm going over to the boarding-house with Uncle Dick , before long . Mighty glad your crops are doing well . How 's Mrs. Pillow and the womenfolks ? " " Fair , " said Reub . " That 's good , " said Richard . " Give them my best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As he left he heard Reub Potter say , " That 's Shaw Blount 's boy . He 's a clever feller . So 's his Pa . So 's the whole blamed family clever . " " I wonder , " mused Richard , " whatever made them switch from cheese to sardines . " He walked aimlessly about the square for some time , listening in on the talk of the county officials , and the farmers who had come to town to attend to their business and to loaf . He walked to Solomon 's saloon and started to go in , but he decided not to . He was n't twenty-one years old yet , and there was a rule about minors going into saloons . He walked casually up and down the pavement , in front of the place , watching people come out or go in . After some time , Little Bas Younger emerged . His head was tied up and he was furiously angry . Will Younger was holding him by the arms . " Keerful , now , Little Bas , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No good can come of hoppin ' Squire Goodner . The shar'ff will jail ye . " " Dang the shar'ff ! " roared Little Bas . " Turn me aloose , dang hit . Let me at that God-blamed Goodner , I tell ye ! " " Why n't you turn him loose , Will ? " suggested Richard , blandly . " Squire Goodner 's got the other end of that pistol . " Little Bas glared at Richard . " Shet yer blamed trap , " he ordered . " ' Y God ! if you was a man I 'd crawl ye right here . " Richard was suddenly angry . " Turn him loose , " he said , quietly . " I 'll take him . " Little Bas jerked free of the men who were holding him , and he lunged at Richard . The boy sailed into him with both fists , knotted hard and flying fast . Little Bas , weakened by the blow from Joseph 's pistol , dizzy from hours of hard drinking , and startled by the sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then took to his heels . A crowd quickly collected about Richard . " That 's Shaw Blount 's boy , " some one explained . " Sailed into Little Bas like a drove of wildcats . " " What did it start about ? " some one else asked . " Nothing . You do n't have to have a reason for fighting with that Hoop Pole outfit . That 's two lickings for the he-coon of the Ridge today . Guess he 'll tuck his tail now . " Richard eased out of the crowd and walked away  | rapidly . He did not feel so proud of himself as he might have , after winning his first fight with a grown man . He went directly to his uncle 's office , and told him what had happened . " Very bad , " said his uncle . " Very bad . I 'm sorry you provoked him , and sorrier still that you whipped him . Little Bas wo n't take two whippings the same day . Especially one from a man half his size and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . " He pulled open a drawer in his desk and took out a pistol . " Can you shoot ? " he asked . " Not too good , " admitted Richard . " Pack this with you , " instructed his uncle , " as long as you stay in the county . Practice shooting it every time you get a chance . Draw quickly , but take careful aim before you fire it . It may save your life some day . " Richard looked the big pistol over carefully before he touched it . " I do n't think I 'd better , " he said . " I never packed a gun in my life , and I do n't believe I want to start . " His uncle pushed the pistol over to him . " You 've mixed up in a man 's fight , now , son , " he said , " and you 've got to handle yourself like a man . And do n't ever stand up and knock with one of the Hoop Pole Ridge crowd , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . They wo n't stand up and fight , fair-fist-andskull . Not the present crowd . The only reason Little Bas tried it with you , or with Joseph , is because he is twice as big as either of you . He 'll never try it on any-  | body else . Now , put this pistol in your pocket and mind out . " Richard walked out of the courthouse , once more . This time he felt differently . He was a man now . He had mixed into a man 's fight . He walked about , getting the feel of the weight of the pistol . After a while he went over to Judge Steelman 's law office . " I believe General Humes wrote you about me ? " he inquired . " Oh yes , Richard , my boy , " said Judge Steelman . " But I did n't expect you until fall . " " I 've decided , " Richard stated , " to begin work right away , if it 's agreeable to you . " The judge pondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall ? " Richard briefly related his plan to spend three months traveling about the country . " Must be some girl mixed up in that , " speculated Judge Steelman . " Your Pa wants you to see a little of life before you get married , I 'll bet . Is that right ? " Richard confessed that it was . " A good idea , too , " agreed the lawyer . " You 'll find the law a hard , confining work . Go kick up your heels while you can . " He got up and took two sheep-bound volumes from the shelf . " In the meantime , if you run out of something to do , you might read Blackstone . If you learn all the law in these two volumes , you 'll know  | a blamed sight more than I do . Now clear out . I 'm busy . I 'll see you about the first of October . " Richard took the books and walked out . He was undecided . A few minutes before , he had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five minutes with Judge Steelman he was a schoolboy again . He went to the livery barn and arranged to have his own horse returned home , and to have a hack convey him and his baggage to the depot . Then , with nothing to do but to wait for the train , he opened his law books and read until train time . It was late at night when he reached Memphis . He went directly to the Gayoso and went to bed . The next morning , at breakfast , he was seized with a feeling of loneliness . There were many people hurrying about ; pointlessly , it seemed to him . Strangers whose existence did not remotely touch him . He tried to imagine who they were and what they were up to , but there were too many , and they came and went too rapidly . He could not attach any individuality to any one of them . After breakfast he addressed a note to his aunt Ophelia , stating he was in the city for a few days and wanted to see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the housekeeper , stating that his aunt and uncle were spending the summer in Middle Tennessee . He wandered about the city for two whole days . He was bored , a little frightened , and homesick . On the third day , in desperation , he sent a note to Dr. Miller .  | In an hour a carriage called at the hotel for him . He was to come right out to the house . The doctor and his wife were fine . They received him warmly , and asked so many questions about his family , that Richard was kept busy for fifteeen minutes , answering them . " And how 's Dick Whiting ? " asked Dr. Miller . " Let 's see , he 's your uncle , I believe ? Your Ma 's brother ? And a fine woman , too , Lila . We 've got to get up there and visit with them sometime . Dick runs that county , and makes them like it . By the way , son , we had a visitor from your county . Daughter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodner . You know her ? " Richard choked . " Yes , sir , " he stammered . " If you did n't you 'd be a slow one , " went on the doctor . " She 's about as pretty a little filly as I 've seen in a long time . " " Yes , sir , " stammered Richard . " She 's mighty sweet . " " I thought so , " laughed Dr. Miller . " Well , it 's too bad you missed her . She went home yesterday . Our daughter went back to visit her . Katie Bell 's sort of lonesome , with Walker Blount 's boy out of town . Looks like a match there , Lila . " " How you talk ! " his wife said . " Katie Bell is only a child , and Forrest Blount is n't half through school . " " When did you say Miss Annabel went home ? " asked Richard . " Tuesday , " said the doctor . " Tuesday ? " said Richard . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat around for a few minutes , feeling restless . Suddenly he stood up . " I 've got to be going . I 've got some packing to do . I 'm taking a boat tonight , for New Orleans , you see . So I guess I 'll be going . " He bowed to Mrs. Miller . " It 's been a pleasure , ma'am , " he said .  | Chapter Nineteen RICHARD SAT AT HIS DESK , FROWNING , AND STUDYING THE COLUMNS OF FIGURES THAT WERE SPREAD BEfore him . Tax money , school money , road taxes , interest on bonds , expected collections  --  the columns merged into a meaningless blur before his eyes . He got up and raised the window shade to the top , so the afternoon sun could shine across his desk . He sat down to the figures again , and looked from them to the portrait over the fireplace . It was a picture of Judge Mitchell , the first judge of Phinizy County , and Richard 's predecessor in office . The portrait was mostly whiskers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hung in graceful waves over the forehead . Thick eyelashes and heavy , beetling brows . But Richard knew that a brain had lived behind all of that hair ; a brain and an imagination that was capable of organizing and establishing a county from wild forests and wilder settlements . " He never had to fret about bond issues , " mused Richard , looking at a letter in his hand . The letter was  | from the Dyer County Court , suggesting the two counties split the cost of a bridge across the Forked Deer River . He put the letter in a pigeonhole that held other petitions to be acted upon by the justices of peace when they assembled next fall at County Court . He reached toward a cabinet in the desk , and then drew his hand back . " I 'm drinking too much , " he said . " By myself . That 's the trouble . Alone too much , with Demetra and the boy away . I reckon I 'm just plain lonesome and tired . " There came a timid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard called , over his shoulder . The door opened and Reub Pillow came in . He stood awkwardly at the door , his hat in his hand and his eye shifting timidly from the floor to the ceiling . " Come in , Reub , " Richard invited . " Have a seat . " Reub slid into a chair and dropped his hat upon the floor . " I do n't know as I 'm overly welcome , " he said , " seein ' as how I been votin ' ag'in you . " " Nonsense , Reub ! " said Richard . " What 's on your mind ? " " Well , " Reub began , twisting his hands together uncomfortably , " you know I ai n't voted with you since ' sixty-six ? " " Yes , " said Richard . " I understand that we disagree politically . " " That 's hit ! " said Reub . " We disagree . But now I  | come to tell you that I air a changed man . I 'm votin ' with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more amused than interested . But he determined to appear appreciative . " Splendid ! " he exclaimed . " Let 's see . You have twelve votes down your way , I believe ? " " Nope , " said Reub . " I ca n't rightly claim but nine . Hope and his two boys air liable to git hard-headed on me and vote ag'in you . I 'll work on ' em , but I wo n't promise . " " At any rate , Reub , " Richard assured him , " I am proud to have your personal support , whether I get another vote out of Forked Deer or not . You 've always struck me as being an honest , hard-working man who paid his debts and supported his family , and that 's the kind of men that make this the biggest little county in Tennessee . " " I 'm mighty proud to support you , " said Reub . " And I 'll say the same for you . " Richard leaned back in his chair and looked toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mused , " what was our trouble about ? " He opened the cabinet in his desk and took out a jug and two glasses . " Have a drink ? " " Do n't mind if I do , " said Reub . " The trouble , " said Reub , when they had drained their glasses , " was about that money . Some of the boys figgered you whanged down on ' em a mite too hard on somethin ' that wa' n't rightly your concern . " Richard shoved the stopper into the jug and replaced  | it and the glasses . " Money ? " he repeated . " What money ? " " The split-up , " explained Pillow . " You whanged down powerful hard gittin ' that split for Mersery and Lafe Potter when the Key Corner place was sold . " " Oh yes , sure , " Richard recalled . " Well , I 'm sorry you boys felt that way about it . But if that is the way you felt , that was the way of it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her interests , even though her marriage did not meet with the approval of her relatives . So you see it was just a case of honest men disagreeing . " " Yep , that 's exactly like I figgered hit , " explained Reub . " I was a-settin ' out yander on the curb , a-drinkin ' and a-eatin ' , and I figgered hit out jest like that . " " I am delighted that we see eye to eye , on that point , anyway , " said Richard , trying to keep the conversation alive . " That 's just what I said , " went on Reub . " I told Cornelius jest them very words . Eye to eye and tooth to tooth , ' I told him . I told him you was a clever man . " " I 'm certainly much obliged . " " But I reckon hit were the other that got me to thinkin ' about hit , " Reub stated . " I reckon I 'm gladder about the other than anything else . Hit was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a log . " " What other ? " " The speakin ' , " explained Reub . " Many 's the time I come to Whitley , and set out yander on the curb and  | drunk and et , hours at a time , and not a soul would speak to me . Hit was powerful lonesome , jest settin ' and eatin ' and drinkin ' , jest with me and my boys , with nobody to talk to . Well , I jest set and hoped . But come right down to it , I reckon I did n't have no call to go blamin ' anybody for not a-wantin ' to speak . Seein ' as how Lafe Potter kilt four of our boys and made clean off with one of our womenfolks . You ca n't blame a body for figurin ' the Pillows had about played out , when things like gittin ' four men kilt and a woman made off with happen , right before yer nose . Yep , hit jest put the Pillows in shame before the community . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first time it had occurred to him that the Pillow family harbored any sense of shame . He always had thought they were slightly cracked , mentally , and were going the way some of the other older families were going , due , probably , to inbreeding . For years , he had watched Reub Pillow and his boys sit on the courthouse curb and eat and drink in silence , but he had never dreamed their conduct was due to anything but a slight mental quirk . " You should n't have let that worry you , man ! " Richard told him . " That 's nothing to feel ashamed of . Lafe Potter was fighting for his woman , and a man will do a lot for his woman . " Of course , the way you boys handled that affair was n't exactly the way I would have handled it . But that 's just another case of different ideas about how to  | handle your business . If one of my kinswomen married a man I did n't like I would n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would make it suit me . I know you boys look at it differently , and that 's your business . But Lafe and his wife seem to be perfectly happy together , and certainly they are not troubling anybody . " " And that 's the truth , " admitted Reub . " But hit warmed by soul when yer nephew , Richard Blount , come up out yander , this mornin ' , and spoke . Clever as ye please . Howdy , Mr. Pillow , ' he said , and Howdy , boys . ' Jest as friendly and clever as a man could be . Hit warmed my heart . How 's yer crops ? ' he says . And yer womanfolks ? ' Jest as friendly as ever a body was . I was mighty proud . He would n't eat with me , but I ca n't blame him for that . Them sardines was powerful strong . The cheeses got so strong I and the boys switched to sardines , and they was stronger than the cheeses . But he chinned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , I says , Dad-burn it all , if Squire Whiting ai n't too proud to send his nephew out to speak friendly with me , I reckon I ai n't too proud to take him my votes . ' And so you 'll git ' em . Nine . Maybe twelve . But I wo n't promise . Hope and his boys air that bull-headed . " Richard was deeply moved . " I want to shake your hand , Reub , " he said , giving Reub a vigorous grip . " Whether you vote with me or not , I want you to know that you have n't got a thing to be ashamed of . As long as a man supports his family , pays his debts ,  | and stays out of trouble , he does n't have to shame himself before any man in the world . " Reub was embarrassed . " I 'll argue with Hope , " he insisted , " but he 's powerful bull-headed ? " " And speaking of eating , " said Richard , looking at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought my nephew was coming back to have dinner over at the boarding-house with me , but he is n't here yet , and I 'm as hungry as a bear . Suppose we go over and see what Henry Solomon can feed us on . " The saloon lunch refreshed Richard , and his talk with Reub did his soul good . He was all ready to return to his desk , and have at the county 's budget with renewed vigor . But as he crossed the lawn , Joseph hailed him . " Can you spare a few minutes ? " Joseph asked . " Sure . Come on in , " invited Richard . They went to the office and sat . Richard expected Joseph to launch into some factual analysis of county money . Joseph always was strictly business , and he always knew exactly how to say what he wanted to get said . Richard automatically reached for a pad and pencil . " I believe , " said Joseph , " that I lost Hoop Pole Ridge for us , today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked pleased . " I heard about that , " he said . " You seem to have done a pretty good job . He 's been chafing about that tax bill all summer . "  | " I had to hit him , " went on Joseph , " even if it did cost votes . " " No , sir , " said Richard . " That lick did n't cost us a single vote . We lost Hoop Pole when Phinizy County started growing . Old man Bas , the he-coon of the whole outfit , ingrained something into those people that you ca n't breed out of them . They 'll stay on Hoop Pole until the last one of them dries up and blows away . Sometimes they vote with us , and sometimes they vote against us . I never count on them . " " Well , " faltered Joseph , " I never go into the practical side of it , but I understand you were expecting a close call , next election ? " Richard laughed . " No , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pole , three at Forked Deer , six at Hatchie , and probably a scattering of twenty-five more all over the county . We 'll carry the election about thirty to one . " Joseph frowned . " I see that I was misinformed . " " You 've been listening to Wash , " accused Richard , still grinning . Joseph almost cringed . " Yes , " he said , curtly , " I did have some talk with Wash . " Richard laced his fingers back of his head and faced Joseph . His face was serious , but there was a twinkle in his eye . He sat that way for several seconds . Joseph was about to leave . " Wait a minute , Joe , " said Richard . " I 'm lonesome . I want to talk to you . I want to talk foolishness . I 've  | been so serious with this budget , here , that I 'm about worn out . What do you say ? My name is Dick Whiting , and your name is Joe Goodner ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits me , " he said . " What 's on your mind ? " " Nothing much , " admitted Richard . " I 'm lonesome . My wife and boy are in the East , hunting cool weather , and I 'm trying to make every dollar you collect in taxes do the work of half a dozen dollars , please all the people , and at the same time do what is best for Phinizy County . " " It 's a big job , " said Joseph . " And I know what it means to feel lonesome . " " Yes , " said Richard . " I imagine you are about the lonesomest man in the county . Now , I 'm forty-three years old and I 've been running Phinizy County for twenty years . " " I have n't heard of any complaints about the job you 've done , " said Joseph . " That 's not what I 'm driving at , " said Richard . " My young nephew passed through here today . " " I saw him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he finished the job I started with Younger ? He 's a likely boy , that Dick Blount . Foolhardy to crawl Little Bas , of course , but he pitched in like a man , and he finished him off in man-size style . " " I 'm proud of him , " said Richard . " I 'm proud of my own boy , too . Naturally , I think I 've got the finest boy in the county . "  | " Certainly , Dick , " said Joseph . " But my boy  --  well , he 's got big-city ideas in his head . He wants to go East to school and to settle in Washington and be a big lawyer . He 'll make it , too . He 's got a brilliant mind . " " But , " Joseph interrupted , " you had hoped he 'd grow up and run Phinizy County after you got too old ? " " I reckon so , " admitted Richard . " That 's what I had in mind . But that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children to do what they 've been doing . Now , Shaw Blount feels the same way about his boy . He wants young Dick to stay down there under the bluffs and run that business . He would n't admit it , if you told him , but that 's what he wants . That boy is too fine to waste his life down there in the bottoms . He 's going to set up here in Whitley and be somebody . " " Maybe he 'll be what you hoped your boy would be ? " " Exactly . What do you think ? " " About what ? " " I do n't know , hardly , " Richard said . " I guess I had Wash in the back of my mind . You sort of raised Wash , did n't you ? " " Yes , I did , " admitted Joseph . " And I have come to think that I may have made a few mistakes with him , too . He did n't turn out so well as I hoped he would . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know about that , " said Richard . " I 'm fond of Wash . Right fond of him . Joe , I 'll be frank with  | you . I never liked you very much . I always respected and admired you , but I never warmed up to you . " Joseph chuckled . " Dick , while we 're on that subject , " he said , " I never liked you a heap , either . You were always so certain , so dead sure of every move you made , and I always had to struggle so hard to make the right decisions . I envied you . I suppose I still envy you . " That 's right , I reckon , " said Richard . " Only it has n't always been so easy as it looks . I got started in this county earlier than you did , and had the jump on you . And , too , I have a little pleasanter way of dealing with people than you have . I make friends more easily , and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I 'll say this : You get there . That 's what I admire in you . You get there , and you get there the right way . No foolishness , and nothing to argue about , once you 've done a job . That 's fine . Phinizy County could use more men like you . " But we were talking about Wash . Now , Wash is a fool in many ways . But he 's a good influence , too . While the rest of the state was in chaos from carpetbaggery and hoodlumism , right after the war , Wash did a heap to keep this county straightened out . He got practically every able-bodied man in the community mixed up in this veteran 's association , and kept them so busy listening to him slay Yankees , that they did n't have much time for night-riding . " " On the other hand , " said Joseph , " Wash 's veteran  | activities have been a constant embarrassment to me . Wash never fired a shot in the war , and neither did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly dropped a heavy load from his shoulder . " I know that , " said Richard . " I 've been knowing that since you first came here . But it 's all right . A man needed some kind of war record to get along in the county , so Wash had enough for all of us . My little campaigns with Forrest are puny by the side of his . I know all about your war activities . The only worry I have is that Shaw Blount might suddenly remember where he saw Brother Voss . Shaw worries about that a great deal , but I do n't think he 'll remember . " " Where did he see him ? " asked Joseph . " In that little house , a quarter off Granny White Pike , near Hubbard Springs , " said Richard . " Shaw and Percy Jones raided that house . You and Wash were hiding there at the time . " " In the loft , " recalled Joseph . " Say , I 've often wondered  --  perhaps you know . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded the house , and then suddenly disappeared . What happened ? " " I was in that party , " explained Richard . " There were only five , but the Yankees thought it was a whole troop , too . We hopped a Yankee supply train in the woods , and did considerable good for ourselves . As a matter of fact , we stole nearly a quarter of a million dollars in greenbacks , on that raid . " " Well , well , well ! " said Joseph . " So that 's it . That  | answers a question that has plagued me for ten years . The war cost you fifty or sixty negroes worth a thousand or more apiece " Sixty-seven , " said Richard . " And you came back and took up where you left off , with plenty of capital  --  I often wondered if you saved your soldier 's pay in Confederate shinplasters ! Well , well , well ! I 'm glad somebody got some good out of the war . I like you much better now , Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , and you seemed to sail right along , without ever turning a hair . " " That 's exactly where I got it . I did n't get all of it , of course . We spent quite a lump on an ill-fated venture , and divided the rest five ways . " " I would have considered taking that money to be dishonest , " said Joseph . " And no doubt you consider it unmanly to refuse military service . But I happen to know you are honest , and I do n't believe you think I am a coward . " " Absolutely not , " said Richard . " I 'll have a drink on it . You wo n't join me ? " " I stick to water , " said Joseph . " But you go right ahead . " Richard swallowed his drink . " We were talking about Wash , " he resumed . " Wash has done some fine work at the church , too . And he has been a constant source of entertainment for the whole community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of God and as a hero of the Confederacy . I doubt if he has any  | more religion than he has had military service . But with Voss coaching him in righteousness and me coaching him in his battles , he puts up a pretty good show . And the people are constantly puzzled , amused , and dumfounded . He 's a good influence . " " Um-humm , " grunted Joseph , reflectively . " I never saw Wash in that light . He 's a sorry farmer and a sorrier manager . " " You ca n't be everything at once , " observed Richard . He walked to the window and watched the sun set . The shadows from the brick buildings across the square reached almost to the wall of the courthouse . Little bare patches , where people had stood about and worn down the grass , looked like dirty splotches of ink on a green blotter . " I put Wash up to preaching , " Richard said , " but I did n't have any idea he 'd turn out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put Wash up to that , just to embarrass you . " " Well , I 'll be dogged ! " exclaimed Joseph . " That sounds like a sorry trick . It certainly did embarrass me . Richard said : " And I think it helped you , too . I think it kept you geared up . I think it made you go at life a little harder , though you had a tough row to hoe , at best . But I did n't have that in mind , either . I put Wash up to his fighting and preaching just to favor a friend of mine . I did it to pay off an obligation that I never could have paid off otherwise . "  | " I do n't see what you 're driving at now , " said Joseph . " Percy Jones , " said Richard . " He was my best friend in the army . I was closer to him than anybody else ? even Shaw Blount . Percy was fine . There was something almost effeminate about him , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't quite know what the attachment was . Maybe men get that sort of feeling for one another , when they 're riding and shooting and being shot at , and not knowing whether they 'll get back to their womenfolks or not . Anyway , I did it out of friendship for Percy . " " That 's strange , " said Joseph . " I drove slaves for Percy Jones ' father , and I knew Percy slightly . I never had any idea he hated me . As a matter of fact , Percy always seemed friendly enough , when we crossed paths . " " It was n't Percy that wanted it , " said Richard . " You 're jumping ahead . You see , Percy was killed ? committed suicide , so Luella Goodner claimed . " " Luella , " interrupted Joseph , " committed suicide , herself . Her death was not accidental . " " Luella was a tragic figure . So was Percy . They were born for it . They lived it and they died it . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unimportant one . They were first cousins , and they had an unnatural love-affair . They were too finely chiseled to live life , and they were too magnificent to destroy themselves . Yet they did . I knew Luella did , and I can easily believe that Percy did .  | " Well , anyway , Luella asked me to do something for Wash . " " Luella asked you ? " " Yes . She wanted me to wreck you . She hated you . As a matter of fact , I think she hated Wash , too , but she blamed you for what Wash was  --  a substitute for the man she really loved . " It just so happened at the time , I needed you for Trustee in the county , and I would n't wreck you . I could have very easily , but I figured the county needed you . I did promise her , however , to elevate Wash so that he would be an embarrassment to you . " I 've had that on my chest , for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I feel better . " Joseph chuckled . " You know , Dick , " he said , " I 'm beginning to like you . As a matter of fact , I think I 'm beginning to like myself , too . " He looked out the window , and then glanced at his watch . " Here , it 'll be night soon . I 've got to get along . Anything else we can clean up , while we 're at it ? " " One more thing , " said Richard . " Wash is planning a country-wide veterans ' reunion , with a barbecue and a brass band from Memphis , and all . " " I heard something of that , too , " said Joseph . " He wants me to bring pressure on you , " Richard went on , " to get into a uniform and into that parade . Wash schemed it out that if you refused , I 'd threaten you with exposure and bring you to law . How about it ? "  | " No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guessed so , " said Richard , " so I 'll compromise with you . It 's getting to be the style for these parades to pick out the prettiest girl in the county and have her ride with the marshal as a sort of female aide . I can salve Wash 's feelings if you 'll let Miss Annabel ride as his aide . " " Hold on , now , " said Joseph . " Annabel is my daughter , you know . If Wash wants to make a monkey out of himself , that 's his business . But Annabel " She 'll be beautiful , " declared Richard , " riding a prancing horse , right behind the band , with her eyes shining and her skirts swishing . I 'll tell you , Joe , there is nothing so beautiful as a pretty woman on a fine horse , with both of them at high tension ! " " I know that , " admitted Joseph . " But on the other hand , what right has my daughter to ride in a veterans ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had ridden with Forrest ? Or charged Malvern Hill ? I think not . " " All right , " agreed Joseph . " If it 'll make Wash feel any happier , she can ride . " Richard looked at his watch . " Getting about supper time , " he said . " Wo n't you come over and eat ? " Joseph got up . " No , I 've got to get on back . " He put his hat on and walked to the door . " I feel a heap better , Dick , " he said . " So do I , Joe . "  | " Well , good-by , " said Joseph . " Good-by , " said Richard . After Joseph left , Richard yawned and stretched . " Wonder what Shaw and Margaret are doing ? " he mused . " I 'll just ride out and chat with them . "  | Chapter Twenty ICHARD CANTERED EASILY ALONG THE DOUBLE BRANCHES ROAD . IT WAS ALMOST DARK , THE EVEning was cool for the summer , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of that road . It had been built by the county , right through Hoop Pole Ridge , and went to the mouth of the Obion River . The Ridge had opposed it vigorously , although they were to be the chief beneficiaries of it , while other communities in the county were begging for roads . The opposition was strong , but Richard held to the proposition that the whole county needed the road more than any one community needed it , and he had won . The road skirted the top of the bluff up hill and ( own . At Double Branches , it was impassable in wet weather , but it was a good road , and Richard felt keen pride in it , that evening . Seven or eight miles out , just before he was ready to leave the road and ride down the bluffs to Shaw Blount 's place , he saw a hazy glare of light in the distance . He stopped his horse and studied it . " A fire , " he  | decided . " Over toward my neighborhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on . " Somebody burning trash . " When he came to the turn-off , he looked at the glare again . It had grown brighter in the past few minutes . " That 's a fire , by George ! " he decided . " I 'll get Shaw and Margaret to ride over with me . " He spurred his horse into a fast gallop down the hill . " Halloo ! Shaw ! " he called . " You all in bed , yet ? " Shaw called that he and Margaret were on the veranda . " Saddle up , " said Richard . " There 's a pretty big fire going over across the hills . Ca n't quite locate it , but it looks fairly big from the top of the bluffs . " Horses were hurriedly saddled , Richard taking a fresh animal for himself , and the three rode off at a gallop . Going up the steep bluff road , Richard had time to tell Margaret that her son had been by and was on his way to Memphis . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's quite a man , though , " put in Shaw . " Margaret has some foolish idea that the older the boy gets , the older she will get . But I always think of Margaret as being like good whisky in an oak barrel . Good whisky never gets old ; it ripens . " They reached the top of the bluff , and the whole sky was lighted . They almost could see the flames now . They struck a long gallop , and pressed their horses to  | it , walking them only up hills . They frequently lost sight of the fire as they galloped through the woods or behind hills . But when they passed The Cedars , and rounded the turn , they could locate the blaze fairly definitely . " I believe that 's Joe Goodner 's place , " said Richard . " I 'm afraid it 's your gin , " said his brother-in-law . " Have n't you got a lot of seed cotton stored there ? " " Yes , but the gin is down by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on a hill . Yes , sir , it 's Joe 's house , I 'll bet . His is the only one big enough to make that much of a blaze . " " What a pity ! " said Margaret . " I do hope it is n't his house . It 's such a nice one . " When they turned from The Cedars trail into the county road , they saw definitely that Joseph 's house was burning . The blaze had died down considerably , but flames still leaped skyward . Everybody in the neighborhood was there , talking , advising , and toting water in buckets and pouring it upon the roof of the barn in an effort to save it . Richard found Joseph . " I saw the blaze from the bluff , " Richard said , briefly . " I brought Shaw and Margaret over . Anybody hurt ? " " All safe , " Joseph told him . Richard saw that furniture had been piled about the yard . " Saved quite a bit , I see . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is empty , " said Richard . " Move over . " " Thank you , Dick , " said Joseph . " I 've sent Annie and the young children over to Wash 's , and the rest of us will make out . " " I mean that , about using my house , " insisted Richard . " I want you all to go over and make yourselves at home . " " And I want you to loan me Annabel , " Margaret put in . " We get so lonesome with our boy away " " That 's mighty kind of you , Mrs. Blount , " said Joseph . " I know she 'd like to go , but she has a house guest . Doctor Miller 's daughter . " " Splendid ! " exclaimed Margaret . " We know the Millers , and I 'm sure he would n't mind ? Oh , here you are ! Annabel , your Pa is going to loan you and your guest to me for a few days . " Annabel blushed in the darkness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . Shaw had already identified Katie Bell Miller and was inviting her gallantly to their home . " I 'm going to call you Uncle Shaw , " Katie Bell told him . " And this is Aunt Margaret ? " she hugged and kissed Margaret affectionately . " I call Uncle Walker and Aunt Ophelia  --  that is , I call them Uncle and Aunt . And Forrest calls Pa uncle  --  but he 'll have to get over that , I 'll tell you ! " " Roy , " observed Richard , " was such a quiet , studious man , and here you are all over the place ! "  | " And you are Uncle Dick Whiting , " Katie Bell said . " I must kiss you , too , " which she did promptly . " You girls get saddled up , " Margaret directed . " I 'm going to ride over and speak to Mrs. Goodner . Poor thing , I know she must be frantic . I 'll tell her , Annabel , that you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble to try to get any clothes . We 'll ride over tomorrow and see if there are any saved . Wait here for me , Shaw . " " You have n't any idea how it got started , have you , Squire ? " asked Shaw . " Do n't know , for sure , " said Joseph . " The only fire that had been in the house , all day , so I 'm told , was in the cook stove . John Ed first saw it burning , from the barn . The whole back end was going pretty strong . A spark could have blown out of the flue and lit in the roof , but apparently it started closer to the ground . The girl that cooks is very careless , and she may have dropped fire out of the stove some way or other . Of course she insists that she did n't . But that is the only way I can account for it . " " It has certainly burned completely , " observed Shaw . " Poplar siding , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like tinder . That 's the oak timbers that are still blazing . " " Hope you were insured ? " " About half . " " I 'm sorry , " said Shaw . " If there 's anything I can do , I 'm only too glad . But I think you 'd better take  | Dick up on his offer to move over there . Demetra and Forrest are away for the summer , and at least it will give you a chance to spread out until you can rebuild or make up your mind what you aim to do . I happen to have a pretty good bank account now . If you get tight for money , let me know . " " Much obliged , " said Joseph . " I 'll have to look about and get things lined up before I decide . Thank you for the offer . " Richard had been wandering around the yard , looking at the blaze from every angle . By the time he had finished , Margaret had returned from her visit with Annie . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Make yourself at home over at my place , Joe , " Richard said . " I 'll pass by and tell Paul to be on the lookout for you . " " I 'll move over tomorrow , Dick , " said Joseph . Richard and Shaw , with Katie Bell Miller riding between them , started off . Margaret and Annabel followed . " I think I 'm going to like you a lot , " said Margaret . " You are such a young lady now . " " Yes 'm , " said Annabel . " I 'm big enough to be a young lady , anyway . Say , Miss Margaret , where is Dick ? He 's due back from school ? " " He came back from school , " said Margaret . " And what is more , he told me all about you and him ? "  | " He did n't ! " exclaimed Annabel , reining down her horse . " Maybe I better " " No , darling , " said Margaret . " I want you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know you . I want you to be around me , so we can get used to each other . I had planned to ask you over Sunday . " " I never was so mortified in my life ! " declared Annabel . " Is n't that silly ? Being mortified ? But I reckon I 'm just plain silly . If you had looked down your nose at me and said  --  you know you have a pretty long nose , Miss Margaret ? " " Have I , Annabel ? " " Yes 'm , but I like it , " said Annabel . " I expected you to look down your nose at me , like some of the prim old ladies in Nashville , and say : Annabel Goodner , did you say ? Who are the Goodners ? ' If you 'd acted that way , I 'd have felt  --  well , I 'd have known how to act then . " Margaret laughed . " I ca n't imagine your not knowing how to act under any circumstances . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something to start with , is n't it ? " " I like more than your nose , too , " said Annabel . " I think you ? Say , where is Dick ? I 've been bragging to Katie Bell about him all summer , and I 'm just crazy to show him off to her . " " Dick is in Memphis just now , " Margaret said . " He 'll be back in plenty of time . You like him very much ? " " Sure , but he does n't know it , " said Annabel.  | " That 's right , " said Margaret . They rode in silence for some time . " Miss Margaret ? " said Annabel . " Yes , dear ? " " You really do n't aim to be mad about me and Dick ? Mr. Blount is n't going to raise sand and disown him and things like that ? " " Why , certainly not , " said Margaret . " Whatever put such notions in your head ? We love Dick as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I am sure that you can make him happy . " " Hm , " said Annabel . Then suddenly she broke into a peal of laughter . " I wish Pa could hear that , " she said . She stopped laughing as suddenly as she started . " Pa , " she explained , seriously , " is a fine man . But he has so many things to look after , that he has n't much time to , well , that is , he  --  he has to be stern . " " I understand , " said Margaret . The party had ridden leisurely through the trail that connected the two county roads . When they got to the top of the bluff again , Shaw drew his horse up sharply . " Say , " he demanded . " Is that a fire , down yonder , too ? " He spurred forward at a gallop , the rest of them following . The sawmill was blazing and smoke was pouring from the ginhouse . Negroes were screaming , toting water , praying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You direct the fire-fight-  | ing , " he said . " I 've got a little business to attend to . I 'll be back before long . " He rode off , up the bluff . Half an hour later he stopped in front of the home of Little Bas . " You , Bas ! " he shouted . " Bas Younger ! Come to the door ! " There was a rustle inside the house , and then quiet . " This is Dick Whiting ! " he called . " I want to talk to you , Bas . " A woman came to the door . " Bas air ailin ' , " she said . " He ca n't come out . " " He 'll come out , " said Richard , " if I have to come in there and smoke him out with my pistol . Now , you come on out here and talk to me , Bas Younger . " Bas came out . He was a sorry spectacle in his long underwear , and barefooted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's the trouble , Squire ? " he growled . " Wakin ' a man up in the middle of the night , like this . " " You 've got a pretty damned good idea , " said Richard . " Squire Goodner 's house burned down tonight . And so did Shaw Blount 's sawmill . " " That 's right bad , " said Bas . " I been asleep . When did hit happen ? " " Yes , I figured you 'd been asleep while it was going on . I 'll bet you 've got a dozen witnesses who 'll swear they stood over you and heard you snoring . I 'd be willing to go on the stand , myself , and swear that you did n't set either place on fire . But I 'll also swear that you had them set . "  | " Why , Squire , " objected Bas , " that 's pretty tall talk , unless you got something to back hit up . " " I 've got plenty to back it up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grand jury , this fall , and have you indicted for arson . You hopped Squire Goodner in Whitley today , and he whaled hell out of you with his pistol . You did n't expect that , but you got it . And that made you mad . Then , you hopped Shaw Blount 's boy , and he whaled hell out of you with his fists . So you came home , like the suck-egg dog that you are , and started burning things down . " " Now , Squire , I did n't have nothin ' to do with that , " insisted Bas . " You had n't ought to talk to a man like you 're talkin ' to me . Hit ai n't right . " " If Shaw Blount knew what I know , " went on Richard , " he 'd come up here and kill you . I wo n't tell him , because we 've got laws in this county and we 've got courts . I do n't want any private violence . But I want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to forget it , ever . " If any more fires break out in this end of the county , or if you try any more of this funny stuff of yours , I wo n't wait until the grand jury meets . I 'll ride out here and kill you , myself . I mean that . I 'll shoot you the first time you hop wrong . Now , you get back there in that house and behave yourself ! "  | Chapter Twenty-one THE BUDGET WAS SLOWLY TAKING SHAPE . THE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO BE SPENT WAS SMALL COMpared with the demands , but Richard carefully allocated it to the county 's most immediate needs . There was so much for roads , so much for schools , and some for the sinking-fund to pay off the Forked Deer bridge bonds , which were , as yet , unissued . On his desk lay miscellaneous papers . There was a plea for a two-teacher school at Batesville , a complaint about the roads at Double Bridges , a protest against lawlessness at Curve Station , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a long letter from Demetra , written from Washington . Forrest , Demetra wrote , had passed his examinations and would enter the university at Charlottesville next month . But in the meantime Senator Harris had offered him an appointment to the United States Military Academy for next spring , and Forrest was eager to accept . " Senator Harris , " she wrote , " recommended the Academy very highly , although I believe our boy could  | do better at the University of Virginia . However , Senator Harris pointed out that the alumni of the Academy includes such distinguished gentlemen as General Lee and President Davis , and with these brilliant characters for his ideal , our boy might do well there . " The real purpose of the letter was buried in a single sentence between a long description of the new President , and an account of her visit to Richmond . " You will be glad to know , " she wrote , " that the Yankees missed the old Hightower mansion , which is now for sale . " The Hightowers were Demetra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once during her girlhood , and it had been her dearest memory ever since . " So The Towers is for sale , " he mused . " Well , well ! In Virginia , where they fight about which fork to use when you 're eating fish . Spiritual dry rot traveling under the name of culture . By God ! I 'll buy it ! " He closed down the top of his desk and walked across the hall to the office of the Trustee . " Joe , " he asked , without preliminary , " would you like to buy my place out there ? " " What ? " asked Joseph . " Well , Dick , I had n't thought about it . As a matter of fact , it did n't occur to me that it would be for sale . " " It is , " Richard assured him . " Well , " Joseph said , " I 've always been in the market for any land that joins mine . But you have quite a  | plant , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Seventy-five thousand dollars for a walk-out . " " It 's worth it , " Joseph agreed . " I 'll let you know tomorrow . " " All right . " " By the way , " said Joseph , grinning , " I had a letter from your nephew this morning . Posted in New Orleans . " " You did ? The rascal has n't written me a word . " " Quite a youngster , that boy , " said Joseph . " Going to marry my daughter . He did n't ask me , mind you . He just announced that he was going to . Rather defiant . I like his tone . I think he 's got some good stuff in him . " " What are you going to do about it ? " asked Richard . " Oh , I do n't know , " said Joseph . " I suppose I 'll have to put up some sort of protest , just to keep from disappointing him . He 's looking for a row , I gather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do to disappoint him . " " Best way to handle it , " agreed Richard . " I think his Pa almost wrecked it when he did n't object a month or so ago . " " You 've been knowing about this , then ? " " Sure , " said Richard . " I know everything  --  about other people 's troubles . " Joseph chuckled . " You counting on living here in town and devoting all your time to the county ? "  | " No , " said Richard . " I 'm counting on clearing out entirely . I 'm going to Virginia and be a gentleman . " " Aw , get out ! " snorted Joseph . " You need a round of calomel . Your liver is out of whack . " " You show me seventy-five thousand dollars , " challenged Richard , " and I 'll show you how quick I can pull up and leave . " He left the courthouse and went to the telegraph office . " Buy ninety-day option on Hightower place . Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he handed the operator the copy , he breathed deeply , as though a heavy burden had just been lifted from him . " It 's damned foolishness , I know , " he said , " but it 's my personal damned foolishness . " He went back to the courthouse . Reub Pillow and his brother Hope were there , waiting in his office . " Well , good morning , boys , " Richard greeted them . " What can I do for you ? " Reub nudged Hope . " You tell him , Hope , " he said . " Nawp , " said Hope . " I kim here with you . You tell him . " Reub swayed back and forth , as if gathering momentum to begin his statement . " Well , Squire , " he said , " hit air like this . I promised ye nine votes in Fawky Deer , and I promised to talk to Hope about the other three . " " That 's right , " agreed Richard , " you did . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hope . Ai n't that right , Hope ? " " Hit air , " admitted Hope . " You shore talked to me strong . " " That 's mighty generous of you , Reub , " said Richard . " I take it , Hope , that you still are inclined not to vote with us ? " " That 's right , " said Hope . " I 'm ag'in you . " " I 'm sorry , " said Richard . " But of course you 're entitled to your opinion . No hard feelings ? " " I ai n't so shore , " said Hope . " I say hit air , and Reub say hit ai n't . Hit 's one man 's word ag'in another . I ai n't never knowed ye to lie , and Reub , here , ai n't never knowed ye to steal ? " " Hold on a minute , Hope , " broke in Richard . " Let 's see what we are driving at . I have n't got the reputation in this county for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about ? " " Reub says Little Bas Younger was a liar , " went on Hope , " and I says I did n't know . So Reub says , we 'll jest go face Squire Whiting , and then we 'll go face Little Bas . " Richard was nettled . " About what , man ? " he asked . " Little Bas , " explained Hope , " kim up to Fawky Deer and ' lowed that you was stealin ' money from the county . He ' lowed ai n't nobody could git as rich as you , jest from farmin ' and tradin ' . " Richard 's muscles hardened and his face set into an  | ugly frown . " Just exactly what , " he demanded , " did Little Bas Younger say ? " " He said jest what I 'm tellin ' of you , " declared Hope . " Yep , " confirmed Reub , " he said them very words . He said ye air stealin ' from the county . I said ye wa n't , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit air a lie , ' cause I 'm gittin ' ye the nine votes I promised ye , and I 'd hate to vote with a thief . " " Listen to this , Reub . And you too , Hope . I have never stolen a copper cent from the county . I have never drawn a copper cent in salary or pay of any kind from the county . I have never used the county 's money to my advantage , any more than I used it to the advantage of any other citizen . The money that I have came to me partly from inheritance , partly from my activities during the war , and partly from careful investments and good trading . Is that clear ? " " I 'm powerful glad to hear you say hit that strong , Squire , " said Reub . " I ' lowed Little Bas was a-lyin ' about hit . " " Yep , " said Hope . " Little Bas ai n't above lyin ' , if he gits mad at ye . " " I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard said . " On your way home I want you to drive by Little Bas ' store . " " We aim to , " said Hope . " We aim to tell him what you said . " " You wo n't have to tell him that , " said Richard . " Tell him that I am coming out there to kill him as  | soon as I get some arrangements made here in town . Tell him I 'll be there sometime before sundown . " As soon as the two brothers left , Richard wrote a letter to Demetra , sealed and stamped it , and put it on top of his desk . Next , he wrote a will , naming Joseph his executor , and put that on top of the letter . Then he went across the hall to Joseph 's office again . " You better make up your mind about that place , Joe , " he urged . " Say , if you 're in a tight for money ? " " No , " said Richard . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know I have n't got seventy-five thousand dollars in the bank , Dick , " said Joseph . " Pay me any time it suits , " said Richard . " It 's a trade , " said Joseph . " We 'll get Steelman to draw up the deed right away , if you 're in a hurry . " " I am , " said Richard . When the deed was drawn and executed , Richard returned to his office . He cleaned and oiled his pistol and slipped it into his coattail pocket . He got his horse from the livery barn and rode toward Hoop Pole Ridge . It was the first time that he had ever set out deliberately to kill a man , and he was surprised at how calm , how matter-of-fact , he felt about it . In the war there was always the excitement of battle , charging horses , yelling men , whining bullets ; one very seldom experienced the actual sense of killing an individual man . Once , at Missionary Ridge , he recalled , he had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Yankee sergeant . Richard had lost his horse and was wandering about on foot , separated from his own command , trying to get another horse and trying to stay out of the way of flying bullets . The Yankee had fired at him from behind a rock , and missed . Richard dropped behind another boulder , and returned the fire . They exchanged several ineffectual shots from cover , but after a while the Yankee became careless in reloading his gun , and exposed his back . Richard shot his between the buttons on the rear of his coat . " Poor devil , " he chuckled , recalling the picture to mind . " I 'll bet he could n't sit down for a week ! "  | Chapter Twenty-two LITTLE BAS SAT ON THE STORE PORCH AS IF IN A DREAM . PEOPLE OF THE SETTLEMENT CAME TO THE STORE , transacted their business , and even addressed remarks to him , but if he noticed the people or heard their talk , he gave no indication of it . It was early September . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blades on the corn to a light parched brown . The cotton stalks were still green , but opened bolls had been found in the fields . From where Little Bas sat he could see practically all of the cleared and cultivated fields of the Ridge . Three generations of Younger muscle had gone into that clearing , but Little Bas did not consider the past . " Looks like she 'll be a danged good crop , " he muttered . " A danged good crop . " Will Younger was puttering about the new ginhouse , getting the machinery in shape for the fall . " Walt Kincaid were handier , " observed Little Bas , " but a fool . " He tightened his lips across his teeth and spat tobacco juice out into the big road . " Or , " he  | chuckled , " maybe he was smart . He shore as hell figgered hit out right about that yaller nigger baby . ' Y God , of he did n't ! Too smart for his own good ! " The thought perplexed him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry him for a second . Walt had challenged Little Bas ' authority , and Little Bas had killed him . That , according to Little Bas , was right and just . But unquestionably Walt was a capable gin man , and smart . Too smart for his own good . That made Walt a fool , for being so smart . The situation became a complicated jumble in his mind , and he dismissed it . " Yah , Jessie Kate ! " he yelled . Walt 's widow came out of the store , and leaned against a post . " What do you want ? " she asked . Little Bas chuckled , and his eyes twinkled . " I heard a good ' n ' , yes-tiddy , " he announced . " I got to listen to some more er yer dirty jokes , Bas Younger ? " demanded Jessie Kate , modestly , but her eyes shown with anticipation . " Tai n't dirty , ' y God ! " explained Little Bas . " Not much of a joke , neither . Onless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangs around Potter 's store . " " Aw , that bunch ! " snorted Jessie Kate . " Well , " went on Bas , " seein ' as how that idjit boy er yer husband 's figgered in hit , I thought I might as well tell you . You know that Kincaid boy ai n't got the brains God give a monkey . "  | " Well , hit ai n't no skin offn my back , one way t' other , " stated Jessie Kate . " What was he up to ? " " If you think this Kincaid yap is crazy , you jest ought to see one they dug up at Dyersburg ! Crazy ? This Dyersburg yap ai n't got sense enough to pour stump water outn a boot with a hole in the toe and directions on the heel . Why , he 's a plum lunatic . Got the St. Vitus dance , and deef and dumb on top of that . Goes about with a shake-rag in his hand , a-twistin ' and a'twirlin ' of it , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calf . " " ' Y God , he sounds crazy ! " grinned Jessie Kate . " Well , " went on Little Bas , " this bunch over at Potter 's store figgered on gittin ' this Kincaid yap and this Dyersburg yap lined up , side by side , to see which c 'd outdo the other . So they got ' em together over at Forked Deer , the other day . A bunch from Potter 's , and a bunch from Dyersburg , and everybody from Forked Deer , all a-watchin ' of ' em . " " What happened ? " urged Jessie Kate . Bas slapped his leg and laughed . " That 's hit , " he roared . " Nothin ' happened ! ' Y God , nothin ' ! They jest stood and looked at each other , and this Dyersburg yap was a-shakin ' of his shake-rag and a-makin ' of them dyin ' - calf sounds . And this Kincaid yap jest stood and looked at him . " " I 've oftentimes wondered what two crazy people would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sol-  | emnly . " Hit looks like maybe they c 'd understand each other . " " Nawp , " declared Little Bas , " they jest stood and looked . And when the Potter 's store bunch figgered the joke was about to be on them unless somethin ' happened , they tried to egg this Kincaid yap on . But he would n't egg worth a durn . And then one of the Potter 's store bunch asked , Well , what do you think of him , Caleb ? ' " And what do you reckon this Kincaid yap said ? " " I do n't know . What ? " " This Kincaid yap said , " went on Little Bas , laughing , " he said , The God-blame fool is crazy to the ground ! ' ' Y God , can you beat that ? Crazy to the ground !

" That calls for a drink , Jessie Kate . " The woman went into the store , and returned presently with two tumblers of whisky . Little Bas wiped his mouth on his sleeve , and handed the glass back to the woman . " And that puts me in mind , " he stated , " that hit 'll be winter comin ' on , first thing you know , and here you are a widow woman " I got plenty of quilts to keep me warm , Bas
