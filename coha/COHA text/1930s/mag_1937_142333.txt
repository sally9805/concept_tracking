If the five conservative Justices of the U. S. Supreme Court had deliberately set out to ' ' humanize " themselves as a means of frustrating President Roosevelt 's plans to reform the Court , they could not have achieved a livelier photographic record of their extra-legal activities last week . There was the morning when photographers waited in the lobby of the apartment house where Justice Van Devanter lives . When Mr. Van Devanter came down accompanied by his two elderly sisters , the photographers cut loose . Incensed because they had not asked his permission ( which on other occasions he has frequently given ) the Justice held his hat before his face , rushed one cameraman and then gripped him by the arm while delivering a lecture on the discourtesy of unannounced snapshooting . He pushed another of the photographers out the door . There was the evening when Alumnus Charles Evans Hughes , ' 81 , attended a Brown University alumni dinner and was caught by the camera beaming happily over a plate of oysters , the twinkle in his eye not betraying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the opposition 's first big witness before the Senate Judiciary Committee . And there was another evening when Justice McReynolds attended , as he usually does , the annual banquet of his fraternity , Phi Delta Theta ( see cuts , p. 15 ) . <P> Mr. McReynolds ' photographic act was the liveliest of all because he was not only seen but heard . At such dinners he usually makes an extemporaneous speech , and so he did last week . The Justice gave a general discourse on good citizenship and the problems of government . In the course of it he referred to the fact that some attorneys complain , when they lose a case , that the Court has been unfair . Said he while an Associated Press Phi Delta Theta took notes : <P> ' ' But the evidence of good sportsmanship is that a man who has had a chance to present a fair case to a fair tribunal must be a good sport and accept the outcome . Courts only decide things that are submitted to them , and only things that are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things come before them that are settled to the general satisfaction . If things come that are not settled to the satisfaction of all , put yourself in the place of the Court and see if you could have done better . <P> " I should like to be optimistic , I should like to tell you that the situation is rosy . I ca n't . But I like to believe in the courage of the American people , and I hope they may make a solution of which they may be proud . " <P> Witnesses Pro , Meanwhile the supporters of the Court plan marshaled their witnesses before the Senate Judiciary Committee , succeeded in assembling a long list of legal educators like Justin Miller , onetime Dean of Duke University Law School and now member of the Board of Tax Appeals , Leon Green of Northwestern , Thomas Konop of Notre <P> Dame , William Draper Lewis of the American Law Institute and former Dean of the University of Pennsylvania Law School , Edward S. Corwin of Princeton.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
