SCIENCE <P> Balloon manufacturers once charged $100 each for sounding balloons not more than 40 inches in diameter . Now investigators of the upper air can get the same balloons for $2 each . Last summer five strings of such balloons , five in each string , were sent up periodically from San Antonio , Tex . to heights of 92,000 ft. ( about 17 miles ) . When the weakest balloon in the string burst , due to the thinning outside air , the rate of ascent of the other four was checked . When the second bag blew up , the remaining ones hovered practically stationary until a clockwork device released a red parachute and dropped a self-charging electroscope which had been recording cosmic ray intensity all the while . Four of the five electroscopes were recovered , sent to Dr. Robert Andrews Millikan of California Institute of Technology . <P> With this data from the highest altitude to which he had ever sent instruments , Dr. Millikan reported last week that cosmic ray intensity increases to a maximum at 66,000 ft. , then falls off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradicts the generally accepted finding of Erich Regener of Stuttgart who sent unmanned balloons up more than 100,000 ft. , found increasing cosmic Bombardment up to 85,000 ft. , a fairly steady intensity above that altitude .
