SEES KANSAS LOST TO HOOVER Ex-Republican Official Says , Curtis Could Not Carry State . special to The New York Times . WASHINGTON , July 18 . ? Hostility to the Republican party is so widespread in Kansas that President Hoover can not carry the State next year and Vice Eresident Curtis can not hope to regl'in a seat in the Senate now held by the Democrats . Charles W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a delegate to the 1928 convention , said today . Kansas , the heart of the wheat belt , he believes to be in the throes of a political revolution , intensified by the record-breaking low wheat prices and unprofitable oil production . This disaffection , Mr. Steiger declared , was spreading throughout the West and would become more apparent as the Northwestern States harvested their wheat and were faced with prices below the cost of production . Mr. Steiger , who Is here as counsel for the Kansas Utility Commission opposing a 15 per cent railroad freight rate increase in a case before the Interstate Commerce Commission , said that his recent survey of political conditions showed that the Kansas . electorate was inflamed against the policies and personalities dominating Republican politics in the State and nation . A Climax of Disaffection . He declared " ' that the protest against the party first appeared last year when a Democratic Governor and United States Senator were elected . This disaffection , he added , had been growing since that time , fanned by the refusal of Congress to place a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached its height with wheat selling on the farms at 23 cents a bushel and the Farm Board doing nothing to stimulate the price , which is below the cost of production . Mr. Steiger said that there had been a growing feeling of independence among the electorate in the past decade and he expressed the opinion that the pendulum had now swung so far from Republicanism that no favorable developments in the next year could overcome the antagonism . He said : " The farmers feel that the administration has ignored their plight , inasmuch as the Farm Board has refused to do anything to stabilize wheat prices . They are inclined to believe that the stabilization buying last year was chiefly to protect lie banks . Then wheat was selling on the Kansas farm at 73 cents a bushel . There was no great need then , the farmer thought , for the government to boost the prices by stabilization buying . " But today , with the price at 23 cents a bushel , the farmer feels that there is something wrong with the board when it declines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new wheat . Blaming Party in Power . " The farmer is sitting amid the gloom of the wheat fields , convinced that the administration is indifferent fo his suffering . He can not be convinced that world surplus has caused the declining prices and places the blame for his troubles on the party in power . Today the Kansas farmer ' in open revolt against the party he was praising some years ago for the prosperity then existing . " Mr. Steiger said that Kansas was in its worst depression in half a century . Its oil wells are closed or running at a loss , live stock prices are off , wheat was produced at a loss , and generally speaking the industrial outlook is gloomy , he said . " Thousands of acres of land are leased for oil exploration on which the cbmpanies pay $1 an acre rental in addition to a royalty , " Mr. Steiger added . " These leases are now being canceled and the lands in many instances are being sold for taxes .

" Many farmers will not harvest their wheat , others are dumping it on their fields to rot . " Mr. Steiger , who is chairman of the Republican Committee of Butler County , reports that a recent canvass showed that in many precincts where President Hoover got from 300 to 400 majority in 1928 not a handful of voters could be found who would say they would vote the Republican ticket next year .
