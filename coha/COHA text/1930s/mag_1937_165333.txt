Last week a Washington , D. C. woman died of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever , a disease which until recently was found only in the remote Bitter Root Valley of Montana and the Snake River Valley of Idaho , Oregon and Washington . The woman 's skin was dotted with typical pinpoint hemorrhages , her lungs and kidneys congested , spleen enlarged , liver degenerated , genitalia hemorrhagic . Two other people in the vicinity have died with the same symptoms since June 1 , and the panicky Capital immediately implored district and public health officials for advice on how to avoid a devastating disease which is new in the East . <P> Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever is caused by a microscopic speck which may be an especially tiny bacterium or an especially big virus . Bacteriologists can not decide which . It is transmitted to man by a tick called Dermacentor andersoni , which in an unknown manner migrated and adapted itself to the greenery of the Appalachian foothills . <P> Picnickers in the woods around Washington are apt to have the tick jump on their necks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health bulletins to local papers advised that the insects be picked off the neck very carefully , without crushing . Children coming in from play in gardens or woods should be gone over . So should dogs , cats and other pets in whose fur the tick might find an intermediate spring board .
