Warden Lewis Edward Lawes of Sing Sing Prison was in London last week inspecting Scotland Yard . Consequently the nation 's most publicized penologist was not on hand to celebrate the initial appearance of a monthly magazine called Prison Life Stories , of which he was billed as editor . <P> Prison Life Stories seemed to be trying to do two mutually exclusive things at once . In " A Dedication " Warden Lawes soberly hoped that " those who are interested in a more rational approach to the problems engendered by delinquency will more clearly understand its many aspects . ... As a result of our efforts , I trust that the public will be more fully enlightened on the subject of crime , and thereby able to formulate definite policies concerning that important social question .

" Two pages later came a lurid account of " Ohio 's ' Bathtub Crime , ' " complete with a provocative sketch of a murdered woman in the nude . Cheek by jowl with a learned discussion of " Scientific Crime Detection " from Assistant Superintendent H. J. Martin of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police was the life story of Los Angeles ' Thomas M. White , the " Rattlesnake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State 's Fighting Attorney General , " sounded the war cry against " Commercial Racketeering , " while in the penny dreadful manner Editor Lawes himself began a novel about New York City 's criminal classes entitled " Legal Larceny . " <P> On Page 8 Chief J. Edgar Hoover of the Federal Bureau of Investigation observed : " The average layman likes to believe that he could be an expert in solving crimes . But as with any other profession , only a small percentage of those who rate themselves qualified are fitted for criminal investigation .
