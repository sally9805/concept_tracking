The Old Rascal . The spectacle of Mr. William Hodge in a bedroom farce will come as a great surprise to his enthusiastic admirers . Long have they been used to seeing him in dramas which rigidly observed , if indeed they did not extol , the principles of virtuous conduct . Now he appears as a chin-whiskered but frisky California lawyer who arrives in Manhattan bent on giving his wife grounds ' for divorce ( among other things , she demolished his excellent wine cellar ) . His method involves a hotel room and a hired trollop , with whom he retires in full view of the audience . The farcical exploits of a crew of blackmailers nearly cause things to go askew , but Mr. Hodge at length avoids the dilemmas which , as playwright , he has devised for himself . That portion of the Hodge public which enjoys rather obvious double-meanings and bedchamber goings-on will have a good time . <P> Dear Old England . A group of English aristocrats impoverished by the War and living in abandoned tramcars on the Sussex Downs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an empty lot , would be sufficient suggestion for almost any kind of play one might want to write . Henry Francis Maltby found fun in the predicament of these elegants ; he wrote a comedy about them which , whether or not they ever existed , greatly amused London , is now on view in Manhattan . <P> At varying times it is sentimental , heavily , socially satirical , slapstick . But despite the romances and lampoons and picturesqueness , it is the reliable spirit of low comedy which prevails . There is a comical , hungry goat , and there is Mr. Reginald Carrington as a lovable old Lord who can scarcely move without veering into some of the precarious makeshift furniture , thereby causing its collaspse . Whenever the tempo lags or the substance thins , some such violent commotion as Mr. Carrington 's table-toppling is almost bound to provoke a horselaugh.
