WE walked over to Union Square the other morning to dry out our soul in the sun , and sat a while with the dismal on the benches  --  the men who were thinking , and waiting . ( We ourself were only waiting . ) Before leaving the Square , we read the motto on the monument , a quotation from Thomas Jefferson : " How little do my countrymen know what precious blessings they are in possession of . . . " Uneasily we glanced around at our countrymen . The only precious blessing most of them were in possession of was the cup of coffee they had recently got from the relief shanty nearby . In such graven words , it seemed to us , the disconsolate must taste the ultimate bile . COUNTRIES might get along bet-N -- .1 ter with one another if they would drop the language of diplomacy , which is hypocritical and prolix . Last week the Japanese consul general in Shanghai wrote a letter to the American consul general about the death of the American aviator who was killed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the letter began , " to bring to your notice reports appearing in today 's China Press and Shanghai Times that Lieutenant Robert Short , an American airman , was shot down over Soochow during aerial fighting . " Now obviously anything like that did n't have to be brought to the notice of the American consul general , who , unless he was sick in bed , would have seen it himself ; and furthermore attention-calling is not an honor . Why did n't the letter begin : " About this fellow Short " or " The dirty job of writing you about Short falls on me " ? The only genuine politeness is honesty . IT would he interesting to know how the railroads are getting on with their new idea of showing movies in waiting-rooms . The South Station in Boston shows newsreels to the waitees , and the Gare St.-Lazare in Paris , we understand , also shows movies in the public hall . We should think a number of people would miss their trains , held spellbound by Marlene Dietrich 's legs or some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : E have noticed that in the after- noon papers the dispatches from the Eastern war arc always dated tomorrow . That is , on February 25 , we read dispatches dated February 26 . It is a double annoyance to read of a war that we do not approve of being waged on a day that has n't arrived yet . NOT long after the figure of Christ had been noticed in the marble of St. Bartholomew 's , somebody discovered two figures in the marble of the Waldorf-Astoria . One was a wizened little man with a beard , the other was a moose . As Dr. Norwood intimated , these curious markings presumably appear as the result of one 's power of thought ; and we are wondering who , over at the Waldorf , has been concentrating on a wizened little man and a moose . We do n't see how you can run a hotel on that basis . WHILE St. Bartholomew 's is in VV our mind , we would like to suggest that , Christ having appeared in the marble , it is high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the church were removed . They are there to keep people from sitting on the wall , and they always seemed to us unchristian . If anybody is weary , he should be allowed to sit down  --  even on a swell church wall . n UR lament over the passing of N -- - ? ninety decibels of milkwagon noise moved one gentleman to supply us with some odd facts about these amusing little things called decibels . It seems that a psychology professor at Colgate spent three years experimenting with the effect of noise on human well-being . He found ( by subjecting students to what must have been a most annoying racket , considering they were earnestly trying to pass their courses ) that a din of sixty decibels , or the minimum daily noise at Fifth Avenue and Forty-second Street , cut down the normal flow of saliva by forty per cent and also played hob with the gastric secretions that even Colgate students need . This meant that merely hanging around any New York street corner was enough to give a man indigestion and gas on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a member of the Brazilian-American Coffee Promotion Committee , rises to his theme ) , the professor also discovered that a good cup of Coffee offsets the decibels and starts the old saliva flowin ' again . Working this thing out to its sombre conclusion , we conclude that the milk company , by cutting down noise and thereby reducing the craving for noise 's antidote , coffee , is also reducing the demand for cream to go in the coffee ; in short , is cutting its own throat . Das Spiel I rather a roundabout way , we A have heard of a new game . The news is welcome , though the source devious . The game was invented , we are given to understand , by some Swedish students in the University of Berlin . It takes three to play it . During the first part of the game , the players merely sit around , chatting and drinking . Then one of the three goes out of the room , and the game is for the other two to guess which one it was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk on gavels some weeks N -- -1 ago , their source and use , brought an invitation from the Gorham Company to drop in and look at their gavels , which we had n't mentioned and of which they are justly proud . We dropped in . Their stock of gavels is at 576 Fifth Avenue , in their Ecclesiastical Department . They are very nice gavels , ranging in price from four to two hundred and ten dollars . What interested us even more , however , is that they also have sterling-silver trowels for cornerstone-laying , and silver picks and shovels . You 'll want to know about the latter in case somebody insists that you turn the first earth for a subway some day . You can get your picks and shovels at Gorham 's for from twenty-five to one hundred and twenty-five dollars , unless you want them all-silver , including handle . All-silver runs to eight hundred and fifty dollars . The Gorham Company 's Ecclesiastical Department supplies most of the tools for the big moments in the lives of public servants . Mayor Walker used a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Gorham trowel on the cornerstone of the Roosevelt Memorial . Cardinal Hayes used a trowel with the Cardinal 's seal on it in enamel when he laid the cornerstone of the Church of the Guardian Angels . A builder came in a while hack and bought a pick and shovel , sterling , two plated picks and shovels , and two sterling trowels , and never said one word about what he was going to do with them . Puzzling . Silver trowels are generally actually used , though not always . The picks and shovels aren't -- it would he a shame to get them dirty , or bent . The dignitaries pose before the photogra phers with them . Afterward the architects usually get to keep them , as trophies . The architects do not , however , get to keep the dignitaries . Art Note A VISITOR to Princeton was im-dt A pressed by a hit of dynamic symmetry he came upon there , in the university chapel , which is Gothic , with a gorgeous interior . Among other things it contains is a replica of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of Princeton . The pulpit is of beautifully carved wood , and above it is a canopy , also of carved wood , which is suspended by a single chain from the roof . Two stay-wires keep this massive covering from swinging and turning on the end of its chain . The end of one Wire , the visitor observed , is anchored behind the organ . The end of the other is wrapped around the extended thumb of President James McCosh . Offstage Noises THE title rile of " Distant Drums " was played , partly on an old chair , by Charles Kuhn , who is a specialist in drums far and near . In " Distant Drums , " he was the whole Indian tribe which caused Miss Pauline Lord such terrible anxiety and finally drew her on and on , into the wings . In the wings , Miss Lord encountered Mr. Kuhn in front of a drum made of antelope hide . Mr. Kuhn , who is a painter when not drumming , had more fun during the run of this play than he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what had been Indian country and heard the drums at ceremonials , so his work at the Belasco carried him hack . He does not limit himself to Indian drums , however . He was the original " Emperor Jones " drummer at the Neighborhood Playhouse and made the noises also for " The Hairy Ape . " His last job was more of a problem than either of the others , partly because the drums had some times to he very distant and other times pretty close . Guthrie McClintic , the producer , was willing to get any drums Kuhn wanted , but just ordinary drums would n't do . The antelope drum , which Kuhn found in a Mexican importer 's place , was all right when the Indians were to be thought of as just around the corner , but not so good when they were beyond yonder distant hill . He got a lot of drumsticks and went around the Empire Theatre , where the rehearsals were held , hitting things with them . He finally found an old chair which had been mended with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few times , Mr. Kuhn said it was just right . Everyone was surprised , but Mr. Kuhn demonstrated and they agreed . After that the old chair was the distant drums . Anyhow , drumsticks are more important to Mr. Kuhn than the drums themselves . Given the right sticks , he can make a convincing noise on most anything . He has many sets of drumsticks . He did n't bother with a score in " Distant Drums . " Just made it up as he went along , remembering Indians he had heard in his youth . Fame ACOUPLE of anecdotes about General Pershing have come to our ear recently . They contradict each other a trifle , but we do n't mind that . The first has a New York locale . The General went to see " Of Thee I Sing " the other evening and enjoyed it , especially when the French Ambassa-dor was on . A man who used to be in the General 's army sat behind him and noticed this ; noticed , also , that nobody in the audience seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the General rather expected cheers and demands for autographs , at least , and followed the great war leader when he went out into the lobby be-tween acts . The observer got sepa-rated , but a short while later heard whispers from a clump of people : " Here he comes , " they said , and there was a movement toward one end of the lobby . The man who had sat be-hind the General edged in to see how old Black Jack was taking it . It was n't old . Black Jack at all . It was old Buddy Rogers , the famous American actor . In Washington , however , the public attitude apparently is differ-. ent . At any rate , after the General had had some of his teeth removed at a doctor 's advice , he heard that his teeth were being sold in souvenir stores in the capital for seven dollars and fifty cents a tooth . " Famous General 's Teeth ! " Pershing , mad as anything , sent three aides out to buy up all they could lay hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the grasp of a morbidly patriotic public . The aides scurried all over town . Toward evening they came hack with one hundred and seventy-five teeth . City Directory THE first complete directory of Greater New York will be issued this year , thanks in a large measure to unemployment . The canvassing is all being done by persons listed with the Emergency Unemployment Relief Committee , which thought of the idea , took it up with R. L. Polk &; Company , Inc. , and is paying the costs . The Committee will get the profits , too , for its work . The directory , which will begin to come out in July , probably , will he in three volumes : fifteen pounds of Manhattan and the Bronx , called New York by the directOry people ; twelve pounds of Brooklyn ; and seven pounds of Queens and Richmond , taken together . Ordered in advance , the three volumes will cost seventy-five dollars ; separately , the Manhattan-Bronx volume will he thirty-five dollars , the Brooklyn one twenty-five dollars , and Queens and Staten Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't order in advance will have to pay fifty , thirty-two and a half , and twenty-five dollars respectively . For this they will get the names , addresses , and occupations , if any , of between thirty-five hundred thousand and four million persons . By the time the facts for these volumes are collected , around nine hundred people who were out of jobs when the Committee thought of tossing off a directory will have put in one hundred and seventy-five thousand man-days , at three dollars and a half a man-day . The canvassers who are working on it are divided into two forces , one to visit business houses and the other residences . Those who go to offices try also to sell the directory , and those who buy get their names listed in big type and with something of a flourish . Canvassers have identification cards , do n't have as much trouble as you might think with suspicious people , and are instructed to be polite , always . Their book of directions even instructs them that " door signal either by hell or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not discourteous . " Some of the canvassers are finding it quite a trick to be impressive , but not discourteous , with a doorbell . Women , the Polk people say , sometimes refuse to give the information ; men seldom . Letters are written in such cases and the man of the house usually answers eagerly . Wives do n't get separate listings , just parenthetical mention , thus : " Cohen Morris ( Rebecca ) clo mfr h 1128 10th ave . " The " h " means Morris is head of the house . There has n't been a New York directory since 1925 , and that one covered only Manhattan and the Bronx ; Brooklyn had its last directory in 1913 . Queens and Staten Island have never had directories . The first New York directory , printed in 1786 , listed Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton side by side . ( It 's being exhibited , with others , in the windows of the Times Building at the moment . ) The Polk people have had lots of experience in directory publishing . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and fifty kinds of directories . New Toys ALADY living by Carl Schurz Park looked out of her window one morning and was amazed to see a procession of sprinkler wagons travelling up East End Avenue , sprinkling enthusiastically . It was especially odd because she saw this on one of the very cold days of last week . It was fine for the children of the neighborhood , who came up in dozens with their sleds . Their fun did n't last lung , however , for in an hour or so a sand-blasting machine arrived and began scouring the ice off again . The lady got so interested that she went out and asked one of the workmen what it was all about . He said it was just that eight new sprinklers had been delivered to the Street Cleaning Department the day before . Could n't wait , apparently , to try them out . Fire Chief M caeiceri- , the new fire chief , is the student type , as evidenced by his passing the Civil Service examination which insured him his new job with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination-takers , the stiffest quizz ever given for the position . Perhaps the Civil Service Commission put the matter off so long , getting snapped at all the time for their delay , because they needed plenty of time to think up mean questions . But they did n't bother McElligott much . He 's a man who rides the subway to and from his home in the Bronx , when he might have a red car with a hell , because the forty-five-minute trip gives him time to study up on hydraulics and other subjects that fire chiefs should know about . He also had a couple of years at the Engineering College of Syracuse University and is a licensed port pilot . McElligott is from Vermontville , New York . He came to this city determined to become a fireman . His first job was in 1905 , stoking a " steamer " which went to fires from North Moore and Varick Streets . He studied fires , took examinations , and went up ? lieutenant , captain , battalion chief , deputy chief , assistant chief , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he was a member of the Marine Division , as captain . He 's fought some of the best fires  --  helped pump water into the burning Equitable Building for thirty-eight hours in 1912 ; turned in a " ninety-nine " alarm , the high alarm mark of the Department , for the Lincoln Square Arcade blaze . He is a big six-footer , but rather quiet and placid , even under strain . He is very religious and almost never swears . A couple of big fires have got a " God Almighty ! " out of him , followed by a blush . He 's a faithful Catholic , but sympathetic with other religions , too . lie always lets Jewish firemen under him have Jewish holidays off , for e : ; ample . It 's in his discretion to allow the time or not and they appreciate it . When he was stationed on the East Side , he did a good deal for poor families , often paying their rent and being very quiet about it . When he was transferred , the Association of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touring car . He 's very popular in the Department , even with the twenty-two officers he surpassed in the test ; even with Thomas J. Dougherty , who has been acting chief since Kenlon retired , but failed the examination , in which 80 was a passing mark . McElligott does n't care much to talk about fires ? is n't showy in any way . He has five citations on the Departtnent 's Roll of Merit and a good deal has been made of them in the newspapers . In point of fact it 's not unusual . McElligott 's secretary has as many . He does n't study hydraulics as earnestly , however . Harlem Mystery IFyou should lose a dia- mond necklace , advertise for it , and then a day or so later receive a note telling you that it may he reclaimed if you call at a certain apartment at an address in Harlem , do n't get your hopes up . The note will be a hoax . A lady who lost a ring under suspicious circumstances has told us her experience . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private detective and went to the Harlem house . The apartment mentioned in the letter bore on its door the name " Smythe . " A colored lady responded to the detective 's knock . He asked her where the ring was and said he was prepared to pay the reward . ( He was n't , of course . He really wanted to arrest somebody . ) The colored woman wearily declared that she did n't have any ring and that if another person called for a lost article she 'd go crazy . She explained and the detective went to the police about it and got confirmation . For two years someone has been writing notes to people who advertise for lost things , saying that the articles may be recovered at the Harlem apartment . The police have n't been able to find the author . The novelty has long since worn off with the Smythe family . For Depositors YOU have to have three keys and a zipper bag to use one of those brass things marked " Night Depository " in the walls of banks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you try to put money in one you 'll end up by feeling frustrated . Banks give the keys to important depositors who are apt to have large sums of money about them late at night , a select circle , but not as small as you might think , for about four hundred New York banking offices have found it profitable to install the contrivances . The zipper hag , of course , is to put your money in . Two of the keys are for it . The third unlocks the depository itself , which is a hollow cylinder with a slot on one side . The depositor unlocks the cylinder , turns the handle until the slot appears , inserts his zipper bag , and lets go . The bag slides down a chute into a vault and at the same time the cylinder swings hack and closes the opening . And there the depositor is , without a care in the world . The hag is numbered for identification and two bank people have to coöperate in getting it out of the vault in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the money out and deposit it to the proper account . Some banks do this and sonic do n't . Some banks require the depositor to come around the next morning and make out a slip . He gets his bag at the same time . The Corn Exchange records deposits without requiring a call , and not only that , the keys it issues fit the depositories at all its branches . Customers can drop in their money no matter what quarter of the town they find themselves in . The depositories were invented by Mr. Samuel P. Yeo of Philadelphia as a sop to people who wanted banks to stay open all night . Holdup men do n't hang around them waiting for people to come up with money . Apparently they never thought of it , even in suburbs like Rye , where residents who own lots of jewelry line up after functions and dump in diamonds . A bank once found a Pomeranian in the vault when they opened it . Their detective investigated and learned that it had been stuffed into the depository by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an airing . He was tired of the dog and found that , by a coincidence , it just fitted the cylinder . The bank did n't tell the wife . Later it found the Pomeranian a nice home , with a non-depositor . Room with a View the sixth floor of the Harvard Club , in Forty-fourth Street  --  upon whose sedate walls we look , with mixed feelings , from our offices  --  there are stalls for undressing members . Perhaps we should say stalls far members undressing . The stalls adjoin the showers . Hard by this room there used to be a barbershop . It was recently removed to the basement , and we have been diligent in trying to discover why . Inquiry among Harvard sons now reveals that the barbershop was moved because club members objected to being looked at , by barbers , while in the nude . Just something about it they could n't stand .
