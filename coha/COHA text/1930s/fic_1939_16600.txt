We propose to show through witnesses that Timothy Calhoon was about to turn King 's evidence against James Smith .  --  139  --  &nbsp; DUNCANIf what Captain Swanson says is true , that James Smith made no pretense about his sedition , why should he be afraid of anyone turning King 's evidence - the King knew who James Smith was . &nbsp; SWANSON ( pompously ) I shall put such treasonable remarks to your zeal for the defendant 's protection . The defendant showed utter disregard for life or property . &nbsp; POOLE ( shouting ) A thousand pounds ' worth of army goods he burned . &nbsp; SWANSON ( affably ) Thank you , Mr. Poole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must have absorbed the complete lack of civilization .

Duncan walks forward ; in his hand a stained shirt , he holds it up before Callendar . &nbsp; DUNCANCan you identify this , Mr. Callendar ? &nbsp; CALLENDARThat there is the shirt Tim Calhoon was wearing when Jim Smith kilt him - there 's the bullet hole . Magistrate Duncan lifts a rifle which has been lying on the table . &nbsp; DUNCANCan you identify this ?  --  141  --  &nbsp; CALLENDARThat there looks like the rifle Jim Smith used to kill Tim Calhoon . &nbsp; DUNCANNow , how far away would you say Jim Smith was standing from Tim Calhoon when you say , he shot him . &nbsp; CALLENDARRight atop of him - not more'n six inches away - just stuck his gun out and plugged him . &nbsp; DUNCAN ( to Swanson ) Have I the court 's permission to make an experiment ? &nbsp; SWANSONMy dear sir , experiments belong to the laboratory  --  do you wish to make a witch 's brew and bring to life the dead to accuse his murderer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; DUNCAN ( angrily ) Why try my client , why not just hang him and be done with it ? &nbsp; SWANSON ( grudgingly ) Proceed with the experiment . Duncan picks up a clean shirt . He looks at the audience , at Swanson , then the officers . He knows the court is hand picked and he does n't stand a chance . He picks up a hammer and tack , walks to the jury and to the wall just alongside the row of officers . He tacks the shirt to the wall . Everyone cranes their necks to see . Duncan comes back . &nbsp; DUNCAN ( to Janie ) All right , Janie.  --  142  --  Janie , knowing what 's needed of her , picks up the rifle and begins to load . &nbsp; SWANSONIs that young hoodlum loading that weapon ? &nbsp; DUNCANThat young hoodlum is a lady , and a dead shot - there 's no cause for alarm . I 'll stand personally responsible for any acts committed here . &nbsp; SWANSON ( testily ) Get on with it ! Janie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own men . She lifts the gun and in doing so brings it along the officers , they sit stiffly . The weapon passes and points at the shirt . Janie is about twenty pacos from it - she fires - the bullet whistles past the end officer and he involuntarily ducks . It thwacks into the shirt . 165 SHOT of Jury - as they stare at the valley men . 166 SHOT of valley men - as they stare at officers . 167 SHOT of officers - as they get the meaning of that shot whistling past them . They seem very uncomfortable . 168 As Janie is reloading . &nbsp; SWANSON ( as he waves away powder smoke with the handkerchief ) Decidedly irregular - and smelly - ( to Duncan ) How many more of these detonations are we to endure ?  --  143  --  &nbsp; DUNCANJust one .

Otherwise I 'll let you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shirt - only six inches away . Duncan talks to Callendar . &nbsp; DUNCAN ( to Callendar ) Would you say that was how far Jim Smith held his rifle from Calhoon . &nbsp; CALLENDARAbout that ! &nbsp; DUNCAN ( sharply ) About that ! You 're certain of all else you saw - why are n't you certain of this ? &nbsp; CALLENDARThat 's how far it was - I 'm certain ! Duncan nods to Janie who fires . Magistrate Duncan brings the shirt to the table . He turns to Swanson . There is a dramatic pause . He holds up the shirts .  --  144  --  &nbsp; DUNCANYou will note the bullet fired at twenty paces left a clean hole  --  that fired at six inches is deeply studded with powder burns . ( he picks up the original Calhoon shirt and holds it up ) You will also note that the shirt Calhoon wore carries a clean bullet hole with no evidences of burn - it was therefore impossible for James Smith to have fired the shot , since by the prosecution 's own witnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have left a burn  --  The shot was fired by some other in the group - some other standing many paces away . There is a mutter in the crowd which rises to a growl . Swanson pounds for silence . Poole leaps to his feet . &nbsp; POOLEWill ye permit a scoundrel to go free - a scoundrel who leads treason and sedition and defies England ? Are the Englishmen who lie dead the world over to have died for a dead cause ? Are these British martyr dead to be mocked by primitive swine who value their puny lives above empire and the march of civilization ? Is there to be a stench in this courtroom that will linger for centuries ? &nbsp; OFFICER ( appalled ) I must protest , sir , the man is innocent of the crime , he . . . . &nbsp; SWANSON ( lividly ; to officer ) You 're under arrest for revealing your decision before a majority vote !  --  145  --  &nbsp; GAGE 'S VOICE ( thundering ) Captain Swanson !

Mac with a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two saddle horses and a pack horse led by Jim , Professor and the young surveyor emerge from the courtyard . They are equipped for a long journey . The men silently stand , waiting for the leave-taking . Jim and the Professor go from one to the other silently shaking hands . Jim comes to Magistrate Duncan . &nbsp; DUNCANYe 'll not change your mind , Jim , and stay ? &nbsp; PROFESSORIt 's become too quiet here  --  &nbsp; MAC ( eagerly ) Maybe we could stir somethin ' up  --  just a small scale scalping  --  with my fightin ' reputation I can afford to lower my standard  --  Say , a modest five Indians a day instead of twenty . &nbsp; DUNCANThe world is full of nasty people and so few good men . May God go with you . Jim walks to the base of the ladder and looks up at Mac . &nbsp; JIMSure you do n't want to go ?  --  First white men to go through the Tennessee hills , just you , the Professor , me and our surveyor friend .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I. . . No. ( shakes head ) I canna go ! Mac subsides . Jim looks at Janie . &nbsp; JIM ( with a little smile ) Even the worst of enemies must part . &nbsp; JANIE ( trying to control her emotions ) Do n't forget us , Jim - do n't ever forget us - not for a small minute  --  &nbsp; PROFESSORNow , lass . . . &nbsp; JIM ( pushing him away ) I 'll do my own talking . ( hesitatingly ) There 's so much for a man to do  --  there 's no time for  --  well - other things . . . ( he stumbles on ) If there was time ; I mean , if I was inclined ; I mean , if there was a woman to love , there would n't be any other woman  --  only you . He mounts his horse , as do the others . He waves to them and is off down the road . As he moves down the road between houses , men and women stop in whatever they are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the look of people losing something out of their lives . Then someone begins to sing YANKEE DOODLE , others pick it up and the music swells . Janie runs into the courtyard . A horse with Janie atop races out of the courtyard and in the direction Jim has taken .  --  149  --  &nbsp; MAC ( shouting ) Janie , where ye goin ' ? Where ye goin ' ? &nbsp; JANIE ( shouting back ) With my man . She dashes down the road . &nbsp; MAC ( scratching his head ) By the skirlin ' blood o ' the MacDougalls if she 's no ' the contrariest female . The music of YANKEE DOODLE swells as we FADE OUT THE END pp. 114-136 &nbsp;
