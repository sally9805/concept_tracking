THE motion-picture business will always serve as a magnet For the diversified talent scattered throughout the world . It is the great international amusement factory , where employees can work unrestricted at manufacturing ideas . And who is there among us that can truthfully say the newcomer has n't a chance ? The men who built it once were furriers , glove and raincoat manufacturers . Its actors came from all walks of life . Its directors were former shoe clerks , wholesale grocers , soda jerkers , ex-actors who had to learn an entire new medium , furniture salesmen , and heaven only knows what else . Its writers were once plasterers , carpenters , sign painters , vaudevillians , schoolteachers and newspapermen . And being the latter was a help , but not necessarily a guaranty of success . Louis B. Mayer was once a deep-sea diver . Samuel Goldwyn was a glove manufacturer . Adolph Zukor and Carl Laemmle were furriers . Jesse L. Lasky managed vaudeville acts and Cecil B. de Mile burned midnight . oil as a struggling playwright . These men built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as strong as ever . They had something on the ball , despite the many stories to the contrary purveyed by the flash geniuses who come and go . Within the next ten years , however , there will be a decided change in the international amusement factory . The young bloods will dominate , and even now they are beginning to make themselves felt . The Selznieks , Zanucks and Wangers . They learned at the expense of their elders and , having reached maturity , found the pace not quite fast enough for them . In time , of course , they will be knocked off by several of the present-day lowly gentlemen who are at this moment toiling in plaster shops , operating projection machines , or dutifully dividing Gaul into three parts in some near or distant high school . That 's why it 's a swell business ; everybody has a chance ; hut , as I 've said before , there 's this little thing called Opportunity to reckon with . Here 's a story that will illustrate the point . I refrain from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kicking , and might look upon the tale as reflecting against their personal accomplish-men t . . Joe Dokes was an assistant director in the early days . He had ambitions to become a first-string director of pictures and became somewhat of a nuisance expounding his contentions . But everybody on the lot considered him a capable man in his line . It was this capability that worked against him , for once a man became known as a perfect property man or assistant director , it required Herculean effort to lift him out of a position in which good talent was so scarce . The company found it easier to keep promising him than to listen to his perpetual arguments . Then one day he was assigned to handle a company for an alleged famous director who was , at the moment , on his way from New York . The picture was one that Joe had always wanted to direct . He was considerably down in the mouth , but went about his work with the courage that had made him tops in his line . I built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theater interior ; a practical structure in which there was to be a fire . The new director arrived in spats and cane , and made many eccentric changes that irritated both Joe and myself . The night before the theater was to be shot , Joe hustled around to hire types for the audience . A motor cop , who had often worked for him , doing bits and extra , put in his bid for a job for his sweetheart . Joe asked him to have her report the next morning on the set . From Cold Water to Hot Water F OR reasons known only to Nature , the sweetheart had a face that only a mother , under pressure , could love . The new director spotted her in the audience and decided to use her for a gag scene in the fire . She was thrilled at being selected for a close shot , but five minutes later was led away crying hysterically . The new director had turned the full force of a fire hose on her unprepossessing features . He was certain it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot up over Cahuenga Pass in his bright red car . A motorcycle cop sirened him to a stop . It was his intention merely to give the man a ticket for speeding , but when the director protested and haughtily identified himself , the cop 's face tightened angrily . " Ohl So you 're the bird who made that big theater scene yesterday , huh ? " The director proudly admitted the fact . // " Okay , " said the motor cop , and climbed into his car . " Let 's take a spin down to the police station . I want the boys to meet the kind of a rat who 'd turn a fire hose on a woman . " Out at the studio , the director 's nonappearance had brought about a mild sort of panic . Two hundred people were on the set , ready to go to work , and , since they were carry-overs from the day before , they must be paid . The only out was to allow Joe Dokes to shoot some scenes until the director showed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vengeance . Two days later , officials sat in a projection room comparing the work of the two men . Joe Dokes was given the directorial job and the new director received his carfare back to New York . Joe is a pretty big man these days . There were a couple of other fellows , too , who were hitting the extra board about that time . One was Harold Lloyd and the other was Hai Roach . They started together in a Universal feature called Samson and Delilah . Later , they got together and made comedies on their own . The big turning point in their career came with the making of a nonsensical bit of celluloid called Just Nuts . By degrees , Lloyd discarded his exaggerated make-up of pinch mustache and tight-fitting clothes , retaining only a pair of horn-rimmed glasses to off-balance the appearance of a well-dressed young man . His judgment was most sagacious , for today he is one of filmdom 's richest men and lives in a home that would make a king look twice to recognize his own palace . Lloyd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniels , who started her career with him and later became one of Paramount 's outstanding stars . The other was Mildred Davis , who is now Mrs. Harold Lloyd . When Film Footage Was Made With Feet jrY FIRST business contact with a big company Al came when Lee Lawson turned over to me some of the technical work on The Last Chance , a picture that featured Frank Keenan . I say " big " because it was the type of film drama prevalent today , and Edward he Saint. , the director , believed in taking his time and doing the thing right . Getting into the eternal chase seemed to be the least of his problems  --  an interesting advancement when one realizes that most of the early pictures worked toward the ultimate chase and nothing else . Keenan intrigued me . An actor with a perpetual grouch , or so it seemed , but he was a Mr. Somebody on the legitimate stage and had answered the call of the films . He had little hesitation when it came to telling the world it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And despite the large studio about him , he was certain the picture business was doomed to early failure . He contended that an actor could not rise to his proper height in a situation because of the shortness of each scene . " On the stage , " he said , " an actor is in motion from the beginning to the very end of a major scene , which gives him the opportunity to feel his audience and make the best of his art . This , of course , is impossible in the movies . " We agreed with him , because we , too , were of the opinion that the celluloid industry would never make serious inroads into legitimate attraetions . I might have been doubly interested in Keenan if I had known at the time that Bayley Avery , his manager for sixteen years , was the father of the girl I was destined to marry . But that 's a later story . During my stay at Universal , my dad had one opportunity to rise above the lowly level of a carpenter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hobart Bosworth called The Scarlet Sin . It had a coal-mining background and , since my dad 's qualifications in that capacity were known to everybody on the lot , we were not surprised when he was asked by the front office to supervise the construction of the tipple . This he did to everyone 's complete satisfaction : but when he saw Turner make the extras dig coal on top of the ground . he gave up the job in disgust . From that time on , he expressed no desire whatsoever to improve his position . He asked only for a full week 's work and Saturday night off to rub shoulders with his buddies at the Buckeye Bar . Roscoe Arbuckle once heard him talk , and told me he would give him $150 a week as a gag man . When I relayed the good news to him , he merely looked at me and said : " And wear a collar ? " So it is really not strange that I am often mistaken for his brother . Universal gave professional birth to both Dorothy Davenport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in a series of pictures in which one was constantly trying to savi , the other from a most horrible death . Paramount saw the potentialities of the young leading man , and soon he was being directed by James Cruze , who , himself , had been a leading man in earlier days , having played opposite Marguerite Snow in the famous Million-Dollar Mystery . Gene Gauntier and Jack Clark were there . When they were n't making pictures of Ould Ireland , in which the hero returned from America in the nick of time to save his sweetheart and her family from being ejected from their thatched hut , then they were doing a Civil War story which concerned the ability of a young Northern spy to hide in the camel-backed trunk of a Southern female sympathizer . Two , Gurt Drama El ACH company had its own type of story . As a 4 technical man , I became acquainted with them all . It facilitated matters a great deal . The moment I heard that Henry McRae was preparing another story for Marie Walcamp and William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a set which I knew would be someplace in the jungle . And an ammunition storehouse was inevitable in a Francis Ford picture . I am quite sure , if pressed , I could repeat verbatim the average script of the day . If u Western , it went something like this : MAIN TITLE The Abbaclabba Company presents PHIL St. FLAMMER in THE RIDE TO DEATH ! SUBTITLE In the little Western town of Cherokee Gulch SCENE Full shot in front of General Store and Sheriff 's Office . A crowd is milling about , and the reason for the excitement is a reward sign which offers $5000 for the capture , dead or alive , of a stagecoach bandit who has a strawberry birthmark on his right cheek . SUBTITLE Then into town rude a stranger . SCENE Stranger on horseback . He eyes the milling crowd earl-misty . And on his right cheek is a strawberry birthmark . And so on .

" He stopped as Jerry reappeared , clutching Madame Balboni 's hand . ' ' ? And now , once again , " said Oppenheim , " here is Madame Theresa Balboni with the second part of her aria . " Nina struck up a chord which was followed , after a momentary hesitation , by the agitated opera star . The song resumed its interrupted flow : Ira i capelli biondi , c certi orrhi Di up celesta linipido . Basta ! Diciamo Me e belle e Immaginiamo it recto . . . Jerry ran a hand through his wet collar .

" Bring her back ! " Then , addressing the microphone , his voice Assumed a sweetness that was incongruous with the expression on his rave : " You have just heard the second part of Madame Balboni 's aria .

" Oppenheim broke off , his eyes bloodshot , as Madame Balboui reappeared , smiling broadly . Behind her trouped four children , who seemed oblivious of Jerry 's deterring gestures . The old woman , flushed and joyous , came to the microphone . " Mille grazic , ladies and gentlemen , " she said . " I thank you for Listening to me . I am so happy , I can not speak . My Angela she is just the mother of twins . Si , , xi . I will bother you no more with my quacking . My little grandchildren  --  Carlo , Rosa , Giuseppe , Pietro and Nina  --  will sing instead .

" J.nuary 23 , /937 " I 'll take it , " said Oppy , striding out of the room just as Madame Balboni entered , bearing a large bottle of wine and three glasses .

RSAGffC LZHTERN ( Continued from Page 17 ) character who laughed when the man kicked the dog was the second heavy . He was necessary in the story , for it was he who betrayed his boss when plot and counterplot were almost unexplainable at the closing moments of the drama . Then there was the old fellow who did n't laugh when the man kicked the dog . He was a good man and , strangely , the father of our heroine . If it was a timber story , he was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villain , who , besides being the superintendent and hoping to gain the plant for his own , was also in love with the old fellow 's daughter . But , of course , she did n't love him . That 's why he was getting the old man in his power , so he could use him as leverage in his effort to win the girl . Virtue ilituays Triumphs The hero was generally a stranger at the beginning of the story . In the brief Western that I began , he worked for the Government and was mistaken for the stagecoach bandit because of the damning birthmark . In the timber story , he was the son of the rich owner and had come West to make good , hoping in time to expose the shenanigans that had been going on at the mill . The girl , under the wily influence of the heavy , believed him to be the real culprit . He , thinking her father the guilty one , could not deny the allegations because he loved her very much and would n't hurt her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Right at that spot , two things invariably happened : The second heavy squealed on his boss and the latter , enraged at the defeat of his plans , kidnaped the girl and set . fire to the timber to block his pursuers . But , of course , he reckoned without the hero  --  and in all my early experiences in pictures I never found a hero who was afraid of lycopodium torches or flares . We had plenty of eccentric people , even in the early days . I stopped in the property room early one morning to talk to Bruno Becker , the gentleman in charge . A woman star hurried in to call her husband on the phone . Evidently , from the conversation , he had just rolled out of bed . The monologue went something like this : " Bob , darling , it 's so lovely to hear your voice . . . . Oh , I 'm so glad , dear . You must . be very careful , you know . . . . That 's right , precious , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob , you did n't ! Oh , you did n't do that , Bob ! . . . You did  --  you really did ? Oh , you poor thing ; you cooked an egg all by your little self ? " And then there was the male star who also directed himself . Ile sat on his horse and the cameraman prepared to crank . " Camera ! " said the actor director , and began looking around for Indians under the palm of his hand . " Cut ! " he cried after fifty feet had been ground through the machine . Then , to the amazement of those preseut , added : " Very good . " And while we 're on the subject of eccentrics , it . would be wise not to overlook myself . Old-timers will recall that 1 rode about Universal on a white horse . This was necessary if I expected to check on all the sets each day . The cowboys thought I presented a ludicrous picture and told me so . It infuriated me and , blind with rage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I took advantage of my position and had one of my tormentors fired . Coming Off a High Horse The next . day , Pat Powers and Carl Laemmle visited the studio . " Here , " said I to myself , as I looked out the window of my office in the administration building at the two notables , " is a chance for recognition . When i walk out there and get on my horse , they 'll ask the studio manager who I am . Maybe they 'll talk to me . " The horse was there , being held by the brother of the cowboy who had lost his job . I walked out , mounted the animal , and folks tell me I went flying off into space . That dirty , wall-eyed cowhand had put a bur under the saddle . The mishap did something to me , for I began to lose interest in Universal . To make matters worse , nobody offered objections when I said I was going to quit . I 've often wished they bad . For the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my trousers . My father 's fifteen dollars a week was all that stood between us and abject poverty . And often there were days running when he was n't called to perform with his little pewter saw and ninety-cent hammer . I suffered because I did n't want to go backward . I was a technical man , and I intended to be that or better before I would do a lick of work . I made the rounds of the studios , but nobody had need for my services . And when I returned home each evening I was too sick at heart to continue my studies as a scenarist . One day I visited a studio at Main and Washington streets . It was surrounded completely by paneled walls and its only identifying sign was one that read : Bostock Animal Farm . As I looked at the panels I became a sign painter once more ; I had an idea . The gateman informed me that David Horsley made pictures there , comedies in which he featured George Ovey . He also produced animal melodramas now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color sketches that looked very good to the eye . I mailed them immediately to Mr. Horsley , including a price for the complete job of sign painting . Two days later he sent for me . Before the week was over , I was making ( Confinned on Parr 48 ) 48 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 23 , 19g7 ( Continued from Page 441 the place look like a circus winter quarters . And while I painted , I became well acquainted with the man who brought the first complete picture unit to California . He was on the down grade then , for competition was pretty keen and he was a little tired . I was only a young squirt at the time , but this I was well aware of : People like to talk to me ; they tell me things I 'm sure they never tell anybody else . And I like that . Horsley even went so far as to call me into his office to chat with me . I amused him no end when I told him that I had worked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had . Names to Conjure With We called the thing A Mother 's Retribution , or The Boy and the Bandit . A saloonkeeper by the name of Dykus had six hundred dollars and a fellow named Nicholson owned a camera . Mique O'Brien , since passed away , teas dramatic critic on the Terre Haute Tribune . He had read a number of wisecracks I had painted on window-display cards , and suggested to the hacker that I was the man to write the story . I did , and we shot the thing at the fairgrounds , putting up canvas sets in the open air . None of us knew anything about the business and the picture was never finished . The one comic note it offered , however , was the chase . It was a ' Western picture , but we had no cow horses , so we used the broad-hacked draft-horses of the Terre Haute Brewery . This might have been all right if the thing had n't been intended for drama . Horsley reciprocated with many interesting stories about the up-and-down struggles of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woodville Latham and his patents , which had proved such an important link in the film trust 's battle for existence . Of John Bunny , who had once been a clerk in a public market and who had risen to fame through the wisdom of Albert E. Smith , producer of Vitagraph pictures . Of Spoor and Anderson , who became the firm of Essanay . The latter partner was known to the world as Broneho Billy . . . . Of Colonel Selig , who discovered Torn Mix back as far as 1910 , when he sent a company to Oklahoma to make a picture . Mix was the United States marshal , a crack shot and a nervy guy , and it did n't take the colonel long to sense his potentialities . He told me of Charlie Chaplin 's beginning in the films , under the guidance of Mack Sennett , and his later acquisition by this same Essanay Company . I was deeply interested in this , because Chaplin was making pictures at the time in Niles , California . And with him was a cockeyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left something with the industry , even if he seems to have been forgotten as a comedian . That is the expression , " 108 . " Acrobats and men who do stunts refer to turnovers in the air as " a one and a half , a two , a two and a half , or a three . " Ben , anxious to snake good , was watching several acrobats at work on the Sennett lot when Sennett himself asked him if he could do a one and a half . To which Ben replied , " I could do that 108 times . " From that time on , any flip-flop in the air was identified as a 108 . And 108 became the label for any slapstick comedian . Once applied , it stuck forever . Harold Lloyd , however , lost the moniker after a series of large and important pictures . One day , a short time back , he came to Paramount to make The Milky Way , a script written by Leo McCarey , Frank Butler and myself . He was given one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed him to express his appreciation , then called him outside and showed him the number on the door . It was 105 . In all my years in pictures , I met Chaplin but once , and that was at an informal gathering . I found him a nervous little fellow who loved the center of the floor just so long as he could make it interesting . And his pantomime was far superior to any of his work I had seen on the screen . And while I 'm on the subject of Chaplin , I must of necessity skip down through the years and tell an amusing story . Nat Spitzer , the man who made Ingagi , that glorious hoax which upset the release dates of major pictures and made them combine to drive it off the screen as a means of self-preservation , once made a series of pictures in which Billy West appeared in the exact make-up of Charlie Chaplin . Spitzer 's contract was for twenty-six pictures . He made twenty-four and then West quit the company . Spitzer thought he had completed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two were still lacking and they must . be made to meet the demands of the exhibitors . Spitzer grew panicky , for he had only two weeks in which to deliver them . And West was nowhere to be had . I was working at the old Balboa studio in Long Beach , directing Milburn Moratite , when Spitzer came to me and asked me if I knew of anybody who could offer a fair imitation of the character . I recalled a young fellow by the name of Charlie Amador who had worked around the comedy lots and who was quite excellent in his imitations of the well-known pantomimist . Amador was secured . and I was asked to direct . him . I had a profound respect for Chaplin and was a little ashamed of the idea , but then , when bonuses are offered in this business , we do strange things . So I made two pictures with a comic who imitated Billy West who imitated Charlie Chaplin . Amador was a smart fellow . He secured a print of one of the pictures and toured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , possibly , was the reason for his first mistake . He assumed the name of Charles Aplin . The Trappings of Comedy But then , too , Chaplin was not so dumb , and in a very short time Amador was explaining to a judge how the whole thing came about . I believe the decision left Chaplin in sole ownership of the derby hat , the flexible cane and a pair of baggy pants . This was not the first time that film companies had contended for the freak garments . New Yorkers will recall the Gargantuan picture of Billie Ritchie , painted on a prominent building . He , too , wore baggy pants and big shoes , and adherents of his insisted that ho was the first to adopt the make-up . A very clever fellow , who died as the result of an accident while making a comedy scene at the Cawston Ostrich Farm in South Pasadena . But back to my knitting . I got a job as a painter in the studio managed by Charles Eyton . It was then called The Oliver Morosco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pictures . Its owners were Frank A. Garbutt and his daughter , Melodile Garbutt . Miss Garbutt was the finest woman I had ever met , and when I look hack upon the years and revive the windbag that was me , I wonder why she ever countenanced my presence in the studio . The sets were far in advance of anything we had done at Universal , for this little studio had specialists in construction and decoration , and spent considerable more money in their building . Una Nixon Hopkins was the art director , an alert middle-aged woman far in advance of the times . Her son , George Hopkins , followed in her footsteps and made quite a name for himself in later years . The set dresser was Ed Willis , now top man for MGM in the same capacity . I was the official shellac spreader on all the new sets . On rare occasions I was allowed the opportunity to hang wallpaper . And wallpaper got me a better job . . William Cliff and J. C. Williams were the painters its the scenic department. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of Skipper Woods . They dealt with a medium strange to me , since they worked on practical structures and duplicated the fine graining of natural wood . Secretly , each hoped to become boss of the shop , for , at the time of my arrival , it had no head . The Wallpaper Way to Success I was hanging paper an a. set designed for a Vivian Martin picture when Miss Garbutt strolled by . It was the first time I had ever seen her , and being a young man with few responsibilities , I talked to hear myself talk . I remember telling her that paper hanging was a put-up job , and was immediately told that the joke belied my general appearance of intelligence . So I grew serious and asked her why she permitted the buying of expensive wallpaper , since the same patterns were printed on cheaper paper and the latter , being of lighter quality , were easier to hang . She asked me to come to her office at two o'clock , and there plied me with questions about my past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2:15 I was boss of the paint shop , and two men , who knew considerably more than I , scowled every time I came within their line of vision . Later , we became friends and worked together harmoniously for many months . The studio was rather small , but it certainly had some ambitious ideas . Only outstanding personalities were starred  --  actors who came to Hollywood with a legitimate stage reputation . Frank Lloyd was hired by Mr. Garbutt , which marked the important turning point in the director 's career . Also , I got my first taste of writing . One of Lloyd 's pictures was called The Stronger Love and featured Vivian Martin . Lloyd , if I remember aright , played the heavy in the picture as well as directed it , While the company was preparing to go on location to Pinecrest , California , I learned that the publicity man was confined to his home with a cold and could n't accompany them . I dropped my paint brush and made a run for the office . 1 had never written publicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometime . Also I lied a little , and when the company started for the mountains next morning , I was the proud possessor of a seat in the director 's ear . Pete Smith , who in present years has made an enviable reputation as a producer of short novelties , was handling the publicity for the company in New York . I sent reams of material to him and received in reply a very kind letter , in which ho tried to make it clear that I was a dud as a press agent , but that I did show promise in the insane dribble I sent to him which had nothing to do with the activities of the company . The studio officials thought the same as he did , for I was immediately dropped back into the paint shop on my return . My next ambitious effort resulted in my being the first man to have art . titles on the screen . However , the idea was not my own . Irvin Willat made a complete set of highly artistic titles for the Billie Burke picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and came to me for work . He offered a recommendation in several frames of film of decorated titles . I instantly saw the possibilities , and knowing that Willat 's picture would not be on the market for five or six weeks , I went to the office again and asked permission to make titles for a one-reel short which was to announce to the world the acquisition by that company of petite Anna Held in a picture to be called Madame La Presidente . My titles caused a great deal of commotion in Hollywood , but they were far less artistic than those in the picture from which the idea was stolen , It was this effort , however , that impressed the studio bosses , and it was not long before I became the company 's technical director . I handled the Anna Held picture , which Frank Lloyd directed , and a social epic with Constance Collier , The Code of Marcia Gray , which was also one of Lloyd 's . Donald Crisp was another of the directors . Crisp had received his training under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our studio to direct George Behan , the cyclonic little Italian actor , in a series of pictures . I handled the technical end of several of his productions , among which were The Bond Between and Marcellini Millions . Among the actors in the casts were Eugene Follette , who had left the fold of the Triangle Company , and 1-lelen Jerome Eddy , Introducing Local Color House Peters , too , was a star , with alternating directors . His pictures were generally stories about the great outdoors and , as far as I could see , very much alike . He , however , was the handsome , virile type of actor and seemed to have a large following of fans . Dustin Farnum was one of the company 's standbys . Two of his best pictures made on the lot were David Garrick and The Gentleman From Indiana . I worked on the latter as a painter and , influenced by the name of the picture . I thought . it would be a cute idea to duplicate the names of my home-town folks in West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set . I did n't know at the time that people could sue for having their names used promiscuously by film companies . The studio naturally took it for granted that the names I painted were fictitious ones . Had it not been for a preacher friend of mine back home , who mollified some of the angry citizens with kind words , I 'm sure we would have had at least twenty lawsuits to handle . The director of this picture was William Desmond Taylor , who later was killed mysteriously . His real name , I believe , was William Deane Tanner , and he first attracted attention with a serial , The Diamond From the Sky , which he made in Santa Barbara for the American Film Company . He came to our studio shortly after I did , bringing with him a most up-to-date wardrobe and a set of manners that were almost too perfect . Later , he quit the company and went to the Fox Studio , where he made several excellent pictures , among them The Scarlet Pimpernel . He returned to our company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adventures of Kathleen , had made her one of the pioneer stars . Taylor 's manner toward me was most deferential , and my idea of reciprocation was to do something for him that would add value to his production . I conceived the idea of combining art titles with symbolic animation , and defining characters of the cast in the drawings . He was very happy with the results of my effort , which pleased me no end . The picture was one of those saccharine-titled things called Redeeming Love . Later , I worked with him on such pictures as Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn , the latter being renamed Huck and Tom . Many years later I wrote the first talkie versions of these two books in collaboration with William Slovens McNutt . The Lady in Blue And while I 'm on the subject of William Desmond Taylor , I most add something I am sure will be of interest to those who followed the court investigation of his death . Half of the Real-art Studio  --  for the company had changed its name at that , time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were always appointed with the finest furniture that money could rent , and oftentimes in the evening , when a sudden fog would blow in from the ocean , it was necessary for me to hurry hack from a late dinner and see that the sets and furniture were covered . I was certain to meet Taylor , for he , too , always came back , but for the purpose of discussing the detailed routine of the action he planned to shoot the following day , and always his companion was a little lady dressed in blue . She never spoke to me , nor was I ever given the opportunity to come very close to her , but I noticed that Taylor paid the strictest attention to everything she said . Often she would change a complete routine that he had outlined . On several occasions this necessitated my changing the layout of the set early the following morning . These contacts continued for several months , but the woman interested me only because she had a penchant for blue . During the trial subsequent to his death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women who had been questioned and investigated ; this only because I was anxious to see if her picture was among them . It was not . In 1926 , I was working with the Richard Talmadge Company , an independent outfit . We went to Kernville to make some scenes in the region that Bret Harte had called Whisky Flats . My wife was with me. , At noon the first day , she and I sat in the dining room of the town 's only hotel . A limousine rolled up to a stop and a liveried chauffeur opened the rear door . The lady in blue stepped out . She paused only for a few moments , to ask a citizen some questions , then returned to the ear and went on her way . I never knew her name , nor have I seen her since .
