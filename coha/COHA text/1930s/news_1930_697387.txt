McCarthy , a customs guard , who had beaten the doctor with a blackjack during an altercation which occurred when the guard learned that a companion of the physician had a twoounce , bottle of whisky in his possession . At the close of the hearing the magistrate said : " It seems to have come to a pretty pass in this country when a man can be blackjacked because some one has two drinks - of whisky on his person . " He criti cized the type of men employed as agents by the Federal Government and held McCarthy in $5,000 bail for the grand jury . IrEalted or . Piax- by Guard . The physician , Dr. George A. L. Irwin , 42 years old , of 110-07 194th Street , Hollis , with Harry Jones , a friend ; Dr. Ritter Amsel of 145 West Forty-fifth Street and Daniel Thompson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street , at 10 o'clock , last Saturday night . As they were going off the pier a customs guard halted them and asked if any of them was carrying liquor . Jones displayed the two-ounce bottle of whisky and was arrested . McCarthy and a third guard arrived a few minutes later-in an automobile to take Jones to the Barge Office . All of the members of the party got into the car except Dr. Irwin . He was standing on the running board when McCarthy , according to the testimony given in court , exclaimed to him : " What do you think this is , a taxicab ? Get out of here ! " After an exchange of words with the physician , McCarthy alighted from the automobile , drew a blackjack and beat him over the head with it , knocking him to the pavement , it was testified . Doctor 's Head Bandaged . Dr. Irwin appeared in court with his head swathed in bandages and an attendant gave him water frequently while he was on the witness stand . He was taken to the Hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first day he was able to testify . Dr. Amsel told the magistrate that after the attack he attempted to administer ' first aid to Dr. Irwin , but McCarthy drew a pistol and kept him at a distance .. An ambulance wah called by other customs men and the injured man was taken to the hospital . Jones was fined $2 for possession of the liquor . After hearing both McCarthy 's case , in which it was alleged that Dr. Irwin had interfered with and assaulted the guard , and the defense , Magistrate Ford declared : " Now , the prohibition law is not so sacred that the officials enforcing it must resort to clubbing . That is one of the reasons why the law is becoming so unpopular . The law may be all right . It is the law and we have to enforce it . But it seems to me that more tact and diplomacy could be used in enforcing the law . " This man ( indicating McCarthy ) was a truck driver . He had a little schooling in the grammar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go out and enforce this great sacred law . He is a civil service man , but the examination he passed was certainly not a very strict one . He goes out with his little au-. thority . He represents Uncle ' Sam and he thinks a head must be clubbed over two drinks of whisky . It was an unwarranted assault on his part . I am going to order a full complaint for felonious assault against this man .. " If there were many cases like this on record it would show that the agents selected by the Federal government to enforce this law are ntt selected with care . Their qualifications and chaarcter are not examined into thoroughly . Either that or they are not instructed and schooled properly . They should have some consideration and tact . " George N. Brewer , assistant solicitor of customs for New York , was in court during the hearing . Asked by , Magistrate Ford why he was present he said he was there as a spectator .
