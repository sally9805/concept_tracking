Not even Balthasar Henry Meyer , who has sat with the I. C. C. longer than any other member , could recall a ruling similar to one the I. C. C. made last week . The ruling affected not a mighty railroad system but the 23-mi . Fredericksburg &; Northern in Texas , the 65-lb. rails of which have been worn and bent by passing trains since 1889 . Yet it was important as a precedent . <P> Gulf &; West Texas Railway , controlled by Southern Pacific , is linking San Angelo and San Antonio . Vital to the project is the Fredericksburg &; Northern . Its owners asked $350,000 for the property . The Southern Pacific bid only $200,000 , claiming that the line is so rundown that it will cost $733,000 to make its unballasted , steep right-of-way fit for through traffic . Last week the I. C. C. told F. &; N. that unless it sells out for $200,000 S. P. will be granted permission to build parallel tracks . This would cost S. P. only $1,153,000 and would put F. &; N. out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never serve to arbitrate differences between major railroads , but railroadmen last week thought the I. C. C. had found a potent way to drag small railroads from holdout corners .
