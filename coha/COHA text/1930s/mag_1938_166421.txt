With no fuss , feathers , din or dither , U. S. aviation this week came completely under control of the new Civil Aeronautics Authority . Before that , it had been the concern of an assortment of Federal agencies . One of Washington 's most sprawled-out bureaus , CAA took up its quarters partly in the Bureau of Air Commerce , partly in the Bureau of Air Mail , partly in rooms rented over Childs Restaurant on Pennsylvania Avenue . <P> Just before CAA took over , the Post Office Department had to award contracts for several new airmail lines . Average Government subsidy for carrying the mail , during the four years since airmail contracts have been subject to competitive bidding , has been about 17 a mile . But for the new routes , bids reached new lows . Reason : successful bidders were to get their franchises confirmed as long as " public convenience and necessity " demanded them , when CAA took over , and would consequently have places in line if or when CAA handed out a fatter subsidy . <P> Choicest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tex. , Houston and San Antonio . Border-town Brownsville is a U. S. terminus for Pan American Airways . Only other regular commercial airline out of Brownsville , connecting with such points as Houston , San Antonio , Dallas , Kansas City and Chicago , has been veteran Operator Tom Braniff 's bustling Braniff Airways . Capt . Eddie Ricken-backer 's Eastern Airlines , whose network of routes over the eastern side of the continent now reaches as far southwest as Houston , has coveted some of neighbor Braniff 's exclusive shuttle trade . <P> When bids were asked , Tom Braniff and aides , " on the biggest comptometer we could find , " ciphered out the infinitesimal figure of $.00001907378 , per mile , put that in as their bid . Much to their disgust , Eastern , spurning machines and decimal fractions , offered the decisively low bid of $0.00 . The Post Office department sniffed these bargain figures cautiously . Allowing that Eastern 's zero bid might be quite legal , it hemmed and hawed , then announced that it would leave the decision up to incoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , the Post Office decided that $.00001907378 saved is $.00001907378 earned , awarded the Brownsville link to zero-bidding Eastern .
