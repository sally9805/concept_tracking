California 's climate long since ceased to be news . No one knows that better than Arthur Brisbane , able newsman . But on his frequent visits to Publisher Hearst 's ranch at San Simeon , and his own alfalfa farm on the Mojave Desert , he can not resist rhapsodizing in his " Today " colyum over California sunshine , sky , flowers , ocean , mountains , etc. , etc . <P> As a rule , Florida newspapers which buy the Brisbane colyum are tolerant , if unenthusiastic , over the California publicity given them to print . But one day last week the Miami Herald found the day 's offering particularly offensive . From Los Angeles , where he had been witnessing the Olympic Games , Colyumist Brisbane wrote : <P> " This is the place to reproduce a statement by George Young , publisher of the Los Angeles Examiner : <P> " ' There is nothing remarkable about the fact that so many Olympic and world records have been beaten at this Olympiad . IT IS ALL DUE TO THE STIMULATING EFFECTS OF CALIFORNIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that California is the world 's most marvelous Summer resort , in addition to having its most super-wonderful Winter climate . ' <P> " George Young would not deceive you , nor would he exaggerate . This cool air and Summer sunshine , the nights with the inevitable blanket . <P> That was more than the Miami Herald could stomach . The offending paragraphs were deleted before the Herald printed the colyum . From the next day 's offering the Herald lopped off seven paragraphs dealing with California and paradise . On the following day Colyumist Brisbane told how economically one can live in California . Miami readers were not to suffer that . The Herald tossed the whole col-yum aside , dug up and printed instead some two-weeks-old Brisbanalities about naval armaments , the death of Santos-Dumont , etc. , etc . Fortnight ago Westbrook Pegler , eloquent sports colyumist of the Chicago Tribune , was en route to the Olympic Games , writing his syndicated daily piece on the train as does Colyumist Brisbane . In one day 's colyum he aped the Brisbanal style , headlined it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train are going to Los Angeles for the Olympic Games . ' Los Angeles ' means ' the angels ' in Spanish . Study Spanish . Plato said ' No man can know too much knowledge . ' . . . " Gene Tunney , champion boxer , was talked of several days ago as a possibility for the United States Senate . Tunney in the ring would have been no match for a gorilla . The gorilla would have crushed him in ten seconds . But Tunney is more intelligent ; he would be the gorilla 's superior in the Senate . This preserves the balance of power . . . . " In California , where land is cheap and the climate marvelous , visitors to the Olympic Games will see many wonderful bargains in real estate . Visitors to Columbus Circle , marvelous center in busy New York , will see wonderful real estate bargains , too. * It would take man 's fastest airplane 3,000 years to reach Stella Bul-Bul , the nearest star in the firmament . . . .
