txt p 300 sonality into the personality of all mankind was carried to its fullest development by Whitman , but there are traces of it in the Journals of Emerson . In a passage referring to the use of force , previously quoted , Emerson says , " If it threaten man , it threatens me . " This is an explicit avowal of the identity of the one with the many . Again he says , " I stand here for all humanity . " With these for texts Whitman wove into the great fabric of his poems the goodness of humankind and the all-inclusive humanitarianism of his nature . In a very true sense Emerson was the spiritual father of Leaves of Grass . The Puritanism of Emerson. ? Although Emerson has been claimed by many critics as the supreme Puritan in our literary history , it is obvious that such a claim must be preceded by a careful definition of Puritanism . Certainly no man who held the romantic views of the relations of man , nature , and God could be a Puritan of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power and freedom of the human will , and his fundamental doctrine of the divinity of man 's nature , all separate him widely from the Puritans of the first generation who held closely to the stern dogmas of Calvin . In speaking of his Puritan forefathers Emerson said : " Great , grim , earnest men , I belong by natural affinity to other thoughts and schools than yours , but my affection hovers respectfully about your retiring footprints , your unpainted churches , strict platforms , and sad offices ; the iron-gray deacon and the wearisome prayer rich with the diction of ages . " Deep respect Emerson had for his ancestors , but by his own words he was not of their school of thought . He could never allow respect for the past to bind his own actions in the present . If by Puritanism one simply means an ethical outlook on life , then Emerson must be admitted to be a Puritan . Any man who teaches a way of life is an ethical teacher , whether that man be Christ , Buddha , Spinoza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have a great deal of difficulty in proving that any one of these men was a Puritan of the original American variety . An ethical teacher Emerson was , by far the most exhilarating yet produced by our people . His whole work was an effort to find the way to the good life , and if he did not find the way completely to his satisfaction , at least he approximated it and led countless others into a better life . He belonged to the second generation of Puritans , those men whose fully socialized consciences repudiated the harshness and un-  | loveliness of the early Puritanism and lived in the cheerful glow of a good world warmed by the beneficent face of a loving deity . The ethical background alone came down from the older time . Emerson 's Literary Work. ? From the age of seventeen to the age of seventy-five Emerson kept a journal . It was not a diary , such as countless people have kept , telling of the events of one 's external life . An occasional reference to his daily life will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abrupt , as " House burned , " " I was married to Lydia Jackson , " or " Waldo his son walks alone . " Such passages are rare . Most of the space is given to a full record of the writer 's spiritual life and development . The journals are the one and only primary source of information about Emerson and his ideas . They contain his estimates of public men , his reaction to public questions , and his constant speculation on the eternal problems of life . It is by far the most important literary bequest left us by the writer . When Emerson wished to prepare a lecture or essay he would go to his spiritual diary and select passages bearing upon the topic that he wished to discuss . These he would weave together without much regard for smoothness of thought or logical arrangement . As a result some of the essays are quite hard to read in consecutive fashion . For instance , parts of the essay on " Self-reliance " sound like collections of texts for lectures or sermons . Each sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transition between the individual thoughts is rough . Emerson referred to his Journals as his savings bank , and his characterization was strikingly apt . He saved his best thoughts in these pages and used them at need . The Journals were published about twenty years ago in ten goodsized volumes . Recently ( 1927 ) Professor Bliss Perry published The Heart of Emerson 's Journals , an abridged edition in one volume . Emerson owes his chief reputation in American literature to his numerous essays on various subjects . These were drawn originally from the Journals , and many were delivered as lectures . In them the author gave his thoughts their most extended public presentation , for the Journals were not published until thirty years after the author 's death . To-day the essays are invaluable , but the close student of Emerson will wish to determine the spiritual and intellectual background of these works by constant reference to the Journals . The most characteristic essays are those on " Self-reliance , " " NatnrP "  | ( the first essay , published in 1836 ) , " Politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reformer , " " Uses of Great Men " and " Compensation " Aside from his essays Emerson wrote two or three books that are remembered . Chief among these are English Traits , and Representative Men . The latter work seems to suffer from comparison with Carlyle 's Heroes and Hero-Worship . As a matter of fact both of these books are collections of essays , but each chapter is linked to the general subject , whereas in his early works the essays are unrelated Thus far nothing has been said about Emerson 's poetry , but that omission was not caused by a feeling that the poems are slight in value . On the contrary they are of high worth . The great fault is that notable ones are difficult reading . Some one has remarked that Emerson skimmed the cream off his diaries to get his essays , then churned this cream and called the resulting pat of butter a poem . Certainly his best verse is highly concentrated . In it he makes even fewer concessions to the comfort of the reader than he does in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal of his doctrine in a few stanzas . The heavy content frequently makes the verse extremely rough and unmelodious , and often the thought of the writer is too swift for the slow reader . As a result the best known poems are those that are less characteristically Emersonian . Among these are " The Mountain and the Squirrel " ? more correctly known as " The Fable " ? " The Snow-Storm , " " The Concord Hymn , " and numerous others that have an immortality in our school readers . More typical poems are " Good-bye , " " The Rhodora , " " Each and All , " " Brahma , " " The Sphinx , " " Threnody , " " Ode to W. H. Charming , " and " Waldeinsamkeit . " The subjects of the poems are the subjects of the essays ; nature , the mystic relations of God and man and the natural world , duty , and the call to self-trust are the favorite topics . Emerson 's success as a poet is to be attributed more to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbal melody or sensuous beauty . These last qualities he totally lacked . Although he was probably the best poet of the Concord group ? and nearly all of Emerson 's friends attempted poetry ? he had not sufficient command of poetic technique to qualify as a great poet . To-day we usually read his more notable verse as an expression of his ethical teaching ,  | but at his best he is far below the great philosophical poets like Lucretius , Dante , and Goethe . American society has swung so far from the position that it occupied during the transcendental period that to-day Emerson sounds hopelessly old-fashioned , but the very distance that we have traveled from his ideal throws into higher relief the main elements of his doctrine and more sharply points the lesson that he sought to impart . The dangers that he saw have encompassed us . The rising tide of industrialism has submerged the individual . To-day the individual is no longer considered brother-in-the-spirit to God and to the wholly excellent natural world ; he is only an economic unit , a necessary adjunct to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those same machines . In our haste to accommodate ourselves to the demands of the machine age we have lost sight of the dignity and worth of the individual , and in our enjoyment of material goods we have lost many a cubit from our spiritual stature . We are tending to become " robots , " soulless manikins . Against the evil tendencies of industrialism Emerson 's voice is the clearest . He calls man back to his former relations with God and the world about him ; he beseeches the individual to remember that he is a man and not merely a machine ; he summons all to the high duties of life , the highest of which is the reverencing of our own selves and the placing of implicit faith in the self-sufficiency of the individual . HENRY DAVID THOREAU ( 1817-1862 ) Emerson was the clearest preacher of transcendental individualism , but Thoreau lived that gospel . Emerson taught the duty of non-conformity ; Thoreau put his lesson into practice by refusing to conform to any institution that he disliked . Emerson praised a life close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank of Walden Pond and lived alone with nature as his only companion until he was satisfied that the theory of his friend was sound . In short , Emerson and the other Concord transcendentalists gave oracular directions for leading the good life ; Thoreau with canny Yankee practicality tested these directions . Of all the nay-sayers of Concord , Thoreau had , if not the loudest , certainly the most incisive voice . To so many things did he say  | " No " that many have gravely wronged the man by putting him down as a chronic objector . Part of the fault must be attributed to Emerson , whose sincere attempt to praise his closest friend took the form of a catalog of negations : " He was bred to no profession ; he never married ; he lived alone ; he never went to church ; he never voted ; he refused to pay a tax to the state ; he ate no flesh ; he drank no wine ; he never knew the use of tobacco ; and though a naturalist he used neither gun or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not have made some of these denials , others were permanent , but whether permanent or temporary each refusal had for its aim the practical testing of a certain precept . If the denial was satisfactory it was made permanent . To the chronic objector naysaying is an end in itself , but to Thoreau it was only a means to an end , the desired end being a satisfactory life . But there is more than nay-saying in the life and writings of Thoreau . In all his works there are thundering affirmatives , and not the least emphatic of these is the answer to the query : Is life worth living ? Thoreau devoted every day of his existence to the wringing of the ultimate satisfaction out of life , and when he lay on his deathbed , dying with " pleasure and peace , " so his marveling neighbors reported , there escaped from his lips not a single regret . He had made of life what he wished it to be , and he was satisfied . If the possession of the peace that passes understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful in his quest for happiness . A few days before he died a well-meaning friend anxiously asked , " Have you made your peace with God ? " The dying man responded without a quiver , " Sir , I am not aware that we ever quarreled . " In answer to certain questions of superlative importance Thoreau 's life was one longdrawn affirmative . Thoreau and the Problem of Living. ? Thoreau left to others the nebulous problems of philosophy that led some of the transcendentalists into the way of airy speculation and gossamer-like theories . He devoted himself to finding the answers to the ordinary questions of everyday life like : " What shall a man eat ? What shall he wear ? Where shall he live ? What about the problem of making a living ? Is wealth worth getting ? What shall be the average man 's attitude toward the political state ? " With a practical man 's mistrust of speculative answers born of the study he went to the open fields and the streams , to his simple home beside Walden , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems .  | The problem of making a living presented itself to Thoreau , as it does to every one . When he was graduated from Harvard he taught for a short time . This work was unsatisfactory , and he turned to his father 's trade of pencil making . He soon became so expert in his work and made so good a pencil that Boston business men urged him to become superintendent of a factory that they were about to establish . Thoreau promptly rejected the offer . Thereafter he did some surveying for his neighbors , but gained most of his livelihood by working at any manual labor that he wished to undertake . By a careful calculation he had discovered that he could make enough by working a few weeks each year to support himself the remainder of the time . After he made this discovery , he cut his work to the very minimum . In solving his problem of how to live a satisfying life Thoreau approached the question with only one preconception : he was determined to be the servant of no institution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that once some one gave him a paper-weight . He carried his present home to his bare hut and for a time used it , but use entailed an occasional dusting . This was too much bother , and he cast the troublesome thing into the depths of Walden . The anecdote is highly illuminating , for it shows exactly how Thoreau solved the problem of money-making and wealth-getting . Living was the only thing that could be allowed to occupy much of his time ; making a living was too trivial a question to bother with for long . Thoreau soon saw that there were three ways in which he might solve the question of money-making . He could hire himself out to some one who would exploit his labor , as for instance , the Boston pencil makers wished to do . He could hire other men and exploit their work to his gain . Finally , he could reduce his wants almost to the vanishing point and get along without any kind of exploitation . This last was the only satisfactory plan , and he determined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work , therefore he discovered how little work was necessary when wants were brought to the irreducible minimum , and did no more than the required amount . As it was with the question of making a living , so was it with his other problems . Thoreau refused to have anything to do with anything that made requirements upon his time and energy . These were treasured as divine gifts , to be used only in the grand experiment of living . As he said himself , he " drove life into a corner and reduced  | it to its lowest terms , " for he knew that only by getting rid of all extraneous material could he enjoy the full flavor of living . Getting a living was not to be his trade but his sport ; living was his trade . The church was about to make certain demands upon his time and energy , and he " signed off " in the following memorable fashion : " Know ye , all men , by these presents , that I , Henry Thoreau , do not wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I have not joined . " And the chief point with Thoreau was that he joined nothing . The state into whose citizenship he was born , he repudiated Many have objected to the wholesale renunciation that Thoreau practiced , and still more have been repelled by the ascetic life that he led in the pursuit of his aim , but hostile critics must remember that the man was putting into practice the doctrine of individualism and that he made no claim that his solution was the only correct one or even that other people would be better for following it . Like Emerson 's his egotism was supreme , but it stopped dead short of imposing views on others , however futile or foolish their lives might seem . Thoreau 's renunciation and his ascetic life hurt no one . They were his own prescription for himself . Other people need not touch them . Thoreau and the Reform Movement. ? The reform movement in general left Thoreau profoundly unmoved . He was far too busy living his own life to be bothered with the multitudinous vexations that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did Dr. Graham propose the amelioration of human ills by eating not a mouthful of meat or white flour ? Well , Thoreau had already found out the most healthful and inexpensive diet for himself , and as proof of his discovery had published his menus in Walden . Did the long hours of labor outrage the sensibilities of Horace Greeley ? Thoreau had discovered the sure cure for that evil . He- had quit working . Universal peace was engrossing the attention of certain Boston intellectuals , but out at Concord Thoreau lived on terms of peace and good-will with God and man , and he was sensible enough to argue that if every one else did the same the abolition of war might be effected with precious little oratory and high-flown resolutions . Reform was a matter of individual effort , and not a thing to be effected by mass-meetings and the enactment of restrictive legislation . Like Emerson , Thoreau was urged to join Brook Farm . He refused to try the experiment , writing in his journal that it was better  | to keep bachelor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in heaven . Walden Pond offered society enough , and the hut housed enough of a community to suit its occupant . Joining Brook Farm would have been the very negation of all that Thoreau lived for ; it would have been an acknowledgment that his way of life had failed . Certainly he never was in the mood to make any such admission . Every reform proposal drew the same reply from Thoreau ; he had come into the world not to " make it a good place to live in , but to live in it , be it good or bad . " Brook Farm was only another attempt to make over the world . Thoreau and the State. ? Enough has already been said to indicate that Thoreau is our great social rebel , our foremost protester against the tyranny of institutions . Nor did his protest stop short of a flat repudiation of the political state . In a very real sense Thoreau was the spiritual and intellectual heir of the great liberals of the preceding age , Rousseau , William Godwin , Paine , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man led them to advocate a state whose powers would be reduced to the minimum . Just what this minimum was these thinkers did not say . Emerson had implied that the minimum was complete abolition of government , but he had not stated his views in so many words , nor had he ever acted on the assumption that his views should be adopted . It remained for Thoreau to give a practical demonstration of transcendental political theory . In only one reform was Thoreau interested . That was the abolition of slavery . Involuntary servitude was so heinous a fate , and those who held men in slavery were so drenched with guilt that Thoreau would have been willing to forgo any of his theories or his mode of living in order to abolish the hated institution , but up to 1847 his opposition to slavery had been theoretical just as his opposition to the state had never been definitely expressed . The Mexican War precipitated the crisis . Thoreau thought ? quite correctly , it seems ? that the slave power was the instigator of the war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty with the slave states , for it had sent its own state troops to the battle field . Thereupon Thoreau refused to pay his poll tax . For his refusal he was placed in jail , much to the consternation of his neighbors who only advocated the doctrine that their practical friend was putting into practice . It is told , upon doubtful authority , that Emerson went to see his companion in the Concord jail . " Henry , " began the  | older man solicitously , " why are you here ? " " Waldo , " came Thoreau 's ready reply , " why are you not here ? " If the story is true , we may be sure that Emerson was in some perplexity to find a suitable answer . After spending one night in jail , Thoreau was released . One of his friends paid the tax , greatly to the disgust of the prisoner . Soon after this episode Thoreau wrote his famous essay " Oft Civil Disobedience " to set forth his views on the political state . This little work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well-known American . Accepting the theory of Jefferson that that state is best which governs least , Thoreau carries that proposition to its logical conclusion and declares that that state is best which governs not at all . When men are prepared for it , that will be the kind of government which they will have . . . . How does it become a man to behave toward this American government to-day ? I answer , that he can not without disgrace be associated with it . I can not for a minute recognize that political organization as my government which is the slave 's also . . . . It is not a man 's duty , as a matter of course , to devote himself to the eradication of any , even the most enormous wrong ; he may still properly have other concerns to engage him ; but it is his duty , at least , to wash his hands of it . In this essay there is the rage of an Old Testament prophet thundering denunciations of the iniquities of his rulers , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land , are denounces as the authors of slavery , the greatest of iniquities . When we get the full flavor of the radicalism expressed in " Civil Disobedience , " we do not greatly wonder that most of Thoreau 's commentators have neglected entirely to mention the essay . However laudable the intention of the commentators may have been , the omission is inexcusable . That essay puts the cap-stone on Thoreau 's work . It states explicitly the social philosophy toward which his earlier life and work were tending . Without it the author becomes too much of an echo of Emerson , far too much of a naturalist . Thoreau was neither ; he was , as he said himself , " a poet , a mystic , and a transcendentalist . " Above all he was a social philosopher who carried to its flinty , logical conclusion the pleasant liberalism of Jefferson , Paine , Godwin , and Rousseau . Emerson and Thoreau. ? Although the relations of Emerson and Thoreau were close and long continued , still it is a mistake to con-  | sider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Certainly there was a reciprocal influence existing between them . Each influenced the other , but Thoreau was possessed of too original a nature and too acute a mind to become a mere copy of any one . He was strictly a product of the good rich earth of Concord watered by transcendental doctrine . Nothing bookish was there about him , and he never aspired to philosophical profundities . His everyday life as described in his books is the best possible argument in support of the contention that transcendentalism was a native American product and that it would have developed in this country without the slightest foreign influence . Without the influence of Emerson , Thoreau would not have had his conscious connection with transcendentalism , but he would have been the same poet , the same mystical lover of nature , and the same implacable foe of society . This reciprocal influence existing between the two men probably can never be disentangled . It was the custom of the older historians and critics of American literature to speak of Thoreau disparagingly , as one of the " minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Emerson . Such characterizations are no longer attempted . To-day we realize that he was a major figure in our literature . His style alone would compel such an appraisal , even if he had no other claims to eminence , and other claims he has in plenty . But with the elevation of Thoreau 's position the problem of his relations with Emerson become more difficult of solution , for so long as he was only a minor figure it would suffice to admit that all his good qualities were a reflection of his friend . To say that the problem is a tangled one is stating only half the truth . It has been proposed to settle the difficulty by acknowledging Emerson to have been an original thinker and Thoreau an original doer . This suggestion seriously raises the question if Emerson was not as much stimulated by the life of Thoreau as Thoreau was by the utterances of Emerson . When Emerson established his residence in Concord in 1835 , Thoreau was a boy of eighteen , far more mature in mind than in years . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though his first essay on " Nature " appeared the next year . Presumably his mind was maturing rather slowly , and certain it is that his striking social and political doctrines were not yet elaborated . In 1838 , when Thoreau was twenty-one , Emerson has the following entry in his diary : " My good Henry Thoreau made this else solitary afternoon sunny with his simplicity and clear perception .  | How comic is simplicity in the double-dealing , quacking world . Everything that boy says makes merry with society , though nothing can be graver than his meaning . " This entry seems to indicate that in his social thought Thoreau was already as advanced as Emerson was . Again Emerson wrote , " Thoreau gives me in flesh and blood . . . my own ethics . " Certainly a man who consistently practices what another preaches must not be without influence on the preacher . The Walden Episode. ? Critics of Thoreau have talked about the life at Walden far too much . Some have considered it the turning point in Thoreau 's life , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was neither . Living at Walden for two years and two months was only an episode in Thoreau 's life , an experiment . When the experiment was successfully completed , he went back to Concord , not because he did not like life in the woods , but because he had something that he wished to do in the village . In the beginning Thoreau borrowed Alcott 's ax and built a little cabin beside Walden Pond on land belonging to Emerson . He says that he went to the woods " because he wished to live deliberately , to front only the essential facts of life , and see if he could not learn what it had to teach , and not , when he came to die , discover that he had not lived . " In other words he went to Walden to see if a life of solitude would not help him in extracting the last bit of flavor from existence . His experiment convinced him that his theory was correct , as any one can discover by reading a chapter or two of Walden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concord , for such an experiment too long protracted might become onerous , or might grow to be the very aim and reason for life itself . Thoreau wisely ended his stay in his cabin after twenty-six months . Thoreau as a Naturalist. ? Although Thoreau deserves his highest place in the development of our national mind as a social critic , or rather as a tester of social philosophies , yet the idea that he is primarily a naturalist obsesses the minds of many . It is fairly clear to any one who reads Thoreau 's books and journals in chronological order that the author was first of all a critic of human institutions , and only incidentally a student of nature . A close student , of nature he probably never was , for scientific naturalists have pointed out many instances of his careless observations or mistaken conclusions . He began life as a lover of nature , for it was only in the fields and woods and along the ponds and creeks that he could find an antidote to society . In his early books and journals there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature . The natural world obviously affords a relief from the shortcomings of man . However , the longer he lived , the more engrossed he became in the contemplation of nature , and in the later journals volume after volume is filled with his observations . One is reasonably safe in saying that in his early years Thoreau courted nature like a lover , with more ardor than critical acumen , but in his later years he tended more and more toward the scientific attitude . Works. ? Like Emerson , Thoreau kept a voluminous journal , even more voluminous than that of his friend . He published only two books during his lifetime and both of these were drawn from the journals . These two books are Walden and A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers . After his death in 1862 , his friends and family published Excursions , The Maine Woods , Cape Cod , The Yankee in Canada , and the letters . These books appeared within a space of four years . Later various excerpts from the journals were published , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full text . As a literary figure Thoreau occupies a high position because of his excellent prose style . A finer vehicle could not have been perfected for its intended use . It abounds in the most specific words imaginable , in wit , and in crystal clarity . No man can mistake the meaning of Thoreau 's sentences . Simple Anglo-Saxon words flowing in melodious sequence make such works as Walden or The Week the easiest books to read in our whole literature . Thoreau avoids the disjointed oracular style of Emerson that seems to be a string of epigrams . If the epigram comes , he does not scorn it , but he fills up the space to the next pithy utterance with a prose so well-ordered that the reader unconsciously floats along with the stream of thought . General Characteristics. ? It is superfluous to point out that Thoreau was an individualist , a mystic , a believer in the fundamental goodness of the individual , and an optimist . These things are implied in the transcendental faith that he openly professed . It is more to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society produced by the romantic movement , and one of the chief manifestations of this movement was the criticism of human institutions . If he did not like the state he would let his life be a " counter friction to stop the machine " and to those who remonstrate with him for not conforming at least outwardly he blandly replies , " If a man does not keep pace with his companions , perhaps it is because he  | hears a different drummer . Let him step to the music which he hears , however measured or far away . " For who knows , thought Thoreau , but what the distant tune may be the proper march to follow . It can not be too strongly emphasized that Thoreau , supreme individualist that he was , never insisted upon imposing his views upon others . " If the shoe fits , " he would say in homely phrase , " wear it . " It was every man 's duty to live not according to the light that others held for him but according to the light that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business and endeavor to be what he was made . " Some have dwelt too strongly on the point that a society composed of Thoreaus would be quite impossible . Surely the contention is correct , but let no one become alarmed over the prospect . In two hundred years our continent was able to bring forth only one Thoreau , and it is not likely that the feat will be soon duplicated . Really the danger is not in having too many Thoreaus but in having too few . In many ways Thoreau was the most fortunate of men . He lived to the full , wrung every drop of juice out of life , and died reconciled to both life and death . His was the golden day of romantic individualism , and his own life marked the high noon of that day . Death saved him from the twilight and darkness of the human spirit . Fortunate was he in life , and fortunate in death . AMOS BRONSON ALCOTT ( 1799-1888 ) Bronson Alcott belongs to what some critics have facetiously called the " lunatic fringe " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alcott nor the fringe are half so bad as they have been made to appear . The trouble with Alcott was that he carried to an extreme the transcendental inclination to speculate on the meaning and origin of the universe rather than trying to live in it on decent terms . Furthermore he was as rebellious as Thoreau toward all institutions , and his ability to earn a living could be measured only in minus quantities . Unlike Thoreau he accepted the responsibilities of a family , and his inability to provide for his dependents , as much as his nebulous speculation , made him the jest of his time . He is a truly amus-  | ing figure most of the time , but he is also worthy of serious consideration because of his contribution to American education . Alcotit was the son of a Connecticut farmer whose lack of means made impossible an education for his son . As a young man Alcott was a peddler in Virginia and North Carolina for a number of years . During him sojourn in the latter state he came into contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorably impressed him that he accepted their chief doctrine , a belief in the validity of personal inspiration . Back in New England with a firm mystical belief in the inner light , he naturally joined the transcendentalists His first work after returning to the North was the management of a school in Boston . His ideal was the mental , moral , physical , and esthetic development of his students . This work was to be accomplished in part by a plan of organized play , by the use of the honor system , by the beautifying of the schoolroom , and by a great deal less dependence upon corporal punishment than was then customary . Not an idea was tested that is not to-day a commonplace in even our most backward communities , but at that time the theories were far too advanced for Boston . The introduction into the curriculum of an elementary lesson in physiology caused the withdrawal of about two-thirds of the students . Finally when Alcott admitted a little Negro girl to the school , the remainder of the pupils departed . Alcott'c next scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emerson remarked that the chief difficulty was that there was room in it for only one member . As a firm supporter of all the reform movements of the day , Alcott founded his community on a strictly vegetarian basis . He refused to allow the use of eggs , milk , cheese , and butter , and limited the choice of vegetables to those " aspiring " plants like peas and beans that grew upward . Base edibles like potatoes , carrots , radishes , which grew in the ground , he strictly forbade . As a result menus at Fruitlands were somewhat restricted in scope . Furthermore the labor of horses was not allowed . This necessitated the use of manual labor exclusively , and since the men of the community were fonder of attending reform conventions than of working in the fields , the community soon came to a dismal end . After a long struggle with poverty , a struggle for which he was totally unfitted , Alcott was appointed superintendent of schools in  | Concord . In this post he gave eminent satisfaction to his patrons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tl the curriculum were group singing and systematic lessons in physiology . About this time he began his famous " Conversations , " which were nothing more than lectures by Alcott himself . These efforts brought him in a little money and gave him a chance to indulge in his favorite task , speculative talk , but it was not until his daughter , Louisa May , wrote Little Women that his financial worries were at an end . The chief trouble with Alcott was his obsession by a grandiose desire to answer at once all possible questions as to the origin and meaning of the world , to give in one breath the answer to the riddle of the universe . In striving for such an answer he swept aside as irrelevant all details however pertinent . Generalities alone interested him ; particulars were of no concern . The natural result was that the talker built a castle of clouds a mile high and then attempted to climb to the top . The results were ludicrous to practical-minded onlookers . It was as the dreamer of vast , misty dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience was congenial his talk was said to have been of the most attractive variety . Emerson , who was not uniformly pleased with him , said of his talk : " His discourse soars to a wonderful height , so regular , so lucid , so playful , so new and disdainful of all boundaries of tradition and experience . " Certainly the boundaries of experience never for a moment confined the man 's speculative flights , nor did repeated disillusionment ever cure him of his unconquerable optimism . Thoreau spoke of Alcott 's unquestionable knowledge , " overlaid and concealed by a faith in the unseen and impracticable . . . . He will be the last man to be disappointed as the ages revolve . His attitude is that of greater faith and expectation than that of any man that I know . " Moreover he was never bound by any view that he had previously avowed , however recent his avowal might have been . So great was his inconsistency that even Emerson , that apologist for inconsistency , was moved to protest . " He never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 17th of October ; to-day , Alcott on the 18th of October ; to-morrow , on the 19th . So will it be always . " As a speaker Alcott occasionally let ideas drift in through the haze of speculation , but as a writer he retained all his wordiness as a talker and entirely omitted all ideas . A hostile critic said of one of  | his publications that it was like a railroad train of fifteen cars and only one passenger . He has no place in our literature as a writer , save for some of his very effective sonnets . Just how a man , so verbose that he could not express an idea short of an entire day of talk , could compress his thought into the compass of a fourteen-line poem will always remain one of the literary mysteries of America . However , the fact is embalmed in type in many an anthology . But despite hjs. literary lapses , Alcott was a force among the undoubted men of letters of his day . He enjoyed close personal relations with such men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawthorne , and all of these men found his talk wearying in its sum total but curiously stimulating . He had the faculty of suggesting many lines of thought that he took not the trouble to carry out . Other men profited from his suggestions . In his fundamental views , in so far as we have them , he much resembled Thoreau whom he preceded to jail by several years for his refusal to pay taxes to a government that condoned slavery . His philosophy was that of an extreme transcendentalist , and his humanitarian ideals were those of the most advanced reformers . Intellectually he was thoroughly of his age , save when he talked himself into cloudland . Probably his best characterization is by Emerson , who set him down as a " tedious archangel " THEODORE PARKER 1810-1860 ) As a minister Theodore Parker had all the characteristics of a great molder of public opinion . He possessed what was probably the most impressive mind in America . His stock of exact information was surpassed by that of no contemporary . His marvelous industry held him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was said by one of his fellow ministers to have had the most sensitive social conscience since the days of Luther . His appearance in the pulpit was made memorable by an eloquence that was a compound of courage , child-like simplicity , and unquestionable sincerity . And not the least notable feature of the man was his theology which he gradually reduced until it carried only two points , the God of love and the love of God . This beneficent God manifested His love in every object of the visible universe and in the depth of every human heart whose greatest duty it was to love that divine spirit whose in-  | dwelling presence made all nature and all men one , " even as Thou and I are one . " With this superb moral and intellectual equipment Theodore Parker shook America as it was never shaken by the preaching of one man . Parker was the son of a Lexington farmer in whose veins there was good fighting blood ? Theodore 's grandfather was the Captain Parker who commanded the colonial troops at the Battle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their greatest preacher either for his lowly birth or for his courage that did not stop short of calling to account the most dignified citizens of Massachusetts . After graduation from Harvard he accepted . a pastorate at West Roxbury , going from there in 1846 to Boston , where he preached every Sunday to huge throngs , at first in the Melodeon , later in the Music Hall . America was in a great intellectual and spiritual ferment during his years in Boston , and no man did more to create this ferment than did Parker . Every minute of his waking hours was filled , and his sleep was cut to the minimum . The incessant study that was a fixed part of his regime , letters to friends or total strangers , visitors who dropped in to talk over the political situation , addresses , sermons , conventions , and committee meetings all made his days a grueling task and so sapped his strength that he died at the early age of fifty , looking as if he were seventy . Emerson said , " Theodore Parker has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a son of the energy of New England , restless , eager , manly , brave , early old , contumacious , clever . . . . He was willing to perish in the using . He sacrificed the future to the present , was willing to spend and be spent ; felt himself to belong to the day he lived in , and had too much to do than that he should be careful for fame . " Parker was a grand combination of scholar and practical man . He once expressed the desire to live with men and think with philosophers , and if we can believe those who heard him preach , he fully realized his desire . It was said that his most scholarly addresses sounded like stump speeches . A transcendentalist of the extreme variety , he could express the subtleties of that philosophy in words of one syllable . A reformer with his hands in almost every ameliorative scheme , yet he remained a man of great practical sense , never losing sight of the weaknesses of the flesh or the human desire to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak to his people , it was with the spirit of a moral aristocrat and the words of a commoner  | One of Parker 's great contributions to the life of his time was the translation of current social and political problems into terms of divine justice . Too often the romantics , absorbed in their contemplation of the ideal , lost all grip on reality . Their discussions of contemporary political issues always tended to run off into the hazy reaches of transcendental speculation with never a glance at the economic or social basis of the questions at issue . Such discussions may have been satisfying to the philosophers , but the average man , striving desperately for practical guidance in the everyday matter of casting his vote , demanded more information and less theorizing , more interpretation and less Utopian dreaming . To this man Parker 's was the clear steady voice in the midst of a meaningless babel . No person of the time understood better than the great preacher the real causes of political action and the ultimate aims of our obscure national policy , but never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our politics distract his eyes from the fixed light of truth and justice beside which all earthly policies had to be tested . In the testing if it became necessary to mention eminent and respectable Bostonian names , Parker never hesitated , nor did he shrink from applying harsh epithets to those names if the holders were guilty of wrong-doing or of condoning wrong . Boston never forgot or forgave the famous address on the Nebraska Bill and the still more famous one on Webster in 1852 . The last was the most merciless and realistic analysis that an American statesman was ever subjected to at the very close of his career . In this as in every public utterance Parker never lost his hold on either mundane facts or his romantic idealism . Parker 's Political Views. ? In his political views Parker was the nearest to an agrarian democrat of all the New England romantics . He never forgot that he was the son of generations of Lexington farmers , whose democracy , like that of the frontiersman , was the practical equalitarianism of the small landholder . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of absolute equality of rights and privileges , just as they did on the frontier , just as they would before the bar of divine justice . The fugitive slave , the scholar , the farmer , the aristocrat could alike claim to be partakers of the divine spirit inherent in all men , each had in him possibilities of progress , and each could demand the right to live according to his conscience . Such views boldly expressed made Parker one of the most unpopular figures of the time . He and the Boston Brahmin probably never understood , certainly never admired , each other . To the Brahmin  | Parker was guilty of excessive loyalty to his ideals and of bad taste , this last being the worst of offenses in the eyes of respectable Boston . To Parker the Brahmin was guilty of temporizing with truth and justice and of elevating the dollar to an equality with the man . Fundamentally the difference between Parker and such men as Webster and the Boston notables was the difference between industrialism and humanitarianism . Webster once said that the function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and respect and renown abroad . " Beside this materialistic definition Parker put his own contention that the duty of government is to " erect God 's justice into human laws . " The immense gulf separating romantic democracy and New England Whiggery can be measured by computing the distance between these two views . That Parker was a great genuine democrat can never be doubted . In point of development he stood midway between the two American democrats whom he most resembled , Jefferson and Lincoln . Without question he was influenced by the earlier thinker , and he certainly influenced the development of Lincoln . His correspondence with Herndon , Lincoln 's law partner , is one of the significant documents of American history . Parker 's idea of a satisfactory democratic government is best expressed in his own words , afterwards immortalized by Lincoln with only a slight change in phraseology : " . . . a government of all the people , by all the people , for all the people . " Significance of Parker. ? Parker 's importance lies not in his literary work so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his generation . " The center of a thousand minds and the center of a thousand hearts , " he has been called . He forced unpopular issues upon his community and state , he made men think of political questions in terms of divine justice , and he welded romantic idealism and social reality into a compact union . For years he and Horace Greeley were accounted the most powerful influences in America , and the two were one in aim and background . Both were romantic reformers and exponents of social justice , calling a time-serving generation to account for its deeds . Parker was undoubtedly the last great American preacher of national importance . When he began preaching moral opposition to slavery , many ministers were apologizing for the institution , and condoning it on grounds of history , tradition , and economic necessity . Parker made such apologies deep moral offenses . With evil he ad-  | mitted no compromise . Many men hated him because he would give them no peace of mind , but he would not be silenced . His task was to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his successors in the American ministry have devoted themselves to the championing of movements that were already popular . MARGARET FULLER ( 1810-1850 ) At the opening of the nineteenth century woman was in possession of few things that might be called rights . From the cradle to the grave her course was controlled by men ? father , brothers , or husband ? and under their tutelage the only career open to her was that of housewife . However mentally brilliant a girl might be , she could look forward to no other epitaph than that she was " a loving wife and a devoted mother . " Few educational advantages were provided for her in the elementary schools , and none at all in the colleges . Under the laws her husband could dispose of her earnings and could even mortgage or sell the property that she inherited . Woman suffrage was considered the very height of the ridiculous . It was the reform movement that began the woman 's rights agitation in this country . During the thirties when anti-slavery and temperance societies were being formed all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women were among the early and the most ardent advocates of the proposed reforms . Up to that time they had never been given the right to speak in public at any kind of meeting . Among the early abolitionists were the Grimke sisters , two Carolina Quakers who emancipated their slaves to forward the cause of freedom . With these women working beside their masculine associates , it was ludicrous to enforce the ban of silence on women . Garrison , Phillips , and other reformers allowed women to participate in their meetings , although the practice was frowned upon by the conservatives . In 1837 a church convention in Massachusetts passed resolutions declaring that the work of the Grimk6 sisters was unchristian and demoralizing . However , in spite of opposition women were gradually allowed to speak at and to preside over conventions and public meetings . During the thirties Frances Wright , a gifted Scotch woman , aroused great interest and opposition in this country by her lectures  | on questions of the day . During this decade Harriet Martineau , an Englishwoman , also visited here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These visitors acquainted Americans with the advanced thought of England on the question of the position of woman in society , an issue that was raised in 1792 with Mary Wollstonecraft 's Vindication of the Rights of Woman . In 1833 Oberlin , a new college in Ohio , opened its doors to men and women alike . Owing to the efforts of the reformers , the foreign lecturers , and a few other forces , the cause of women 's rights made steady progress from 1830 to 184o . During the forties the tide of feminism ran high . The cause of women 's rights became the subject of a separate reform movement that held its first convention in Seneca Falls , New York , in 1848 . This meeting was followed by others in-various parts of the country . The chief result of the Seneca Falls convention was the publication of a women 's Declaration of Independence that demanded political , economic , and social equality . Among the native reformers identified with the cause of women 's rights were Lucy Stone , who was the granddaughter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lucretia iIott , and Susan B. Anthony . By 185o the cause had made so great progress that suffrage seemed to be within the easy grasp of women . Educational facilities had been expanded , divorce had been made easier , woman was gaining control of her property , and numerous other innovations were marking minor but significant victories for the reformers . Without question the Civil War and the resultant social confusion postponed the winning of national woman suffrage by many decades , and it was not until 1920 that the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote was finally ratified . In the two decades preceding the Civil War many of the advances made by the feminists were due to the large number of women who were demonstrating beyond question that the feminine mind is susceptible of a high degree of development . France produced George Sand ; England the Bronte sisters , George Eliot , and Florence Nightingale ; and America a large number , of whom none was more brilliant or influential than the famous Margaret Fuller . Work of Margaret Fuller. ? Margaret Fuller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter and granddaughter of nonconformers , and accepted to the full the extreme doctrines of transcendental individualism ; and , gifted with an exceptional mind , she  | was constantly brought into contact with the stupid inhibitions and restrictions that hedged about woman 's activities in the America of 1840 . Born in Cambridge , the daughter of a prominent lawyer and politician , she was brought up in an atmosphere of intellectual interests . Her father had broken with Massachusetts Federalism and espoused the cause of Jeffersonian democracy . As a girl Margaret carefully read the letters of Jefferson , and from the political romanticism here expressed she constructed the framework of her own romantic philosophy that later developed in many directions . From Jefferson the young woman proceeded to a reading of Rousseau and tape French romantics , Mary Wollstonecraft 's defense of woman next interested her , and from the English romantics she went to German literature where she found the greatest inspirations of her life . Especially was she influenced by Goethe with his god-like grasp of the problems of life . However , she never escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found on almost every act of her career and in almost every line that she wrote . Rather late in her life , after visiting the library of the Chamber of Deputies in Paris where the manuscripts of Rousseau are preserved , she wrote : Yellow and faded age has made them the manuscripts , yet at their touch I seemed to feel the fire of youth , immortally glowing , more and more expansive , with which his soul has pervaded this century . He was the precursor of all we most prize . . . his spirit was intimate with the fundamental truths of human nature , and fraught with prophecy . There is no one who has given birth to more life for this age . With such an intellectual background it was natural for Margaret Fuller to become one of the Concord group of transcendentalists . Here she was accepted without question as the equal of Parker , Emerson , Thoreau , Alcott , and the other notables . She became the first editor of The Dial , the magazine of the group . She refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she often visited the community . Horace Greeley was so attracted by the intelligence and vivid personality of the young woman that he took her to New York to live in his family and write literary criticism for The Tribune . The work that she did here was fully as good as the best critical writing then being done in this country . Her adverse comments on Longfellow cost her friends among the Harvard group , but she was generally looked upon as an authority on contemporary European literature .  | in 1846 she went to Europe where she served for a while as a foreign correspondent for the Tribune . She met many of the writers whose works she had read with so much pleasure , and at Rome met Mazzini and the other members of the Italian revolutionary party . She was in Rome during the uprising of 1848 , and had charge of one of the hospitals during the siege . Here she married Count Ossoli . Upon her return voyage to America she was drowned together with her husband and small son . Like Alcoa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary figure . Her striking personality and her allegiance to so many causes and intellectual movements made her the most prominent woman of her time . Her early death removed the influence of her commanding presence but did not still the slanders and innuendoes of her enemies . As a result the reputation of the woman . tends to vary from the fantastic to the disreputable . The real Margaret Fuller must be studied in connection with the ferment of her age . To the multitudinous activities of Emerson , Thoreau , Parker , and Greeley she added the task of demonstrating to a skeptical world the fitness of woman for equality with men . This task was accomplished by the persuasive charm of her personality and conversation no less than by the possession of characteristics that made her the equal of Parker as the epitome of American romanticism . THE DIAL From 1840 to 1844 the Concord group published The Dial , a quarterly magazine of transcendentalism . Margaret Fuller was the editor for about two years , and Emerson succeeded her for the remainder of the time . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most distinguished list of contributors . It was considered radical , just as the Concord group was radical , and the Harvard group , Longfellow , Holmes and their followers , did not publish anything in its pages . For a first-hand statement of transcendental interests the historian of to-day can go to no better source than The Dial . The very number of contributors insures the expression of various points of view , a thing that is not certain in an essay or book written by one author .  | REFORM AND THE REFORMERS The general significance and manifestations of the romantic reform movement have already been discussed . It remains only to mention briefly one of the curious products of reform and to speak of a few of the most notable reformers who made their influence felt in literature Perfectionism. ? Calvinism has for two of its main doctrines a belief in the depravity of human nature and a firm disbelief in the possibility of progress . When the romantic revolution rejected both these dogmas and caused the liberal churches to substitute a belief in the goodness of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a matter of time until some idealist would set up the doctrine of the possibility of moral perfection here on earth and the consequent abolition of sin from human society . This doctrine was announced by John Humphrey Noyes ( 1811-1886 ) . While Noyes was a student at Yale he became convinced of the possibility of moral perfection and declared to the horror of the orthodox that he was then living a sinless life . For his audacious heresy he was expelled from his seminary , barred from the pulpit , and dropped from the church roll . Determined in his way , of thinking , he went to his old home at Putney , Vermont , where he preached his peculiar doctrines , at first quietly but , as his followers increased , with greater ardor . Soon he had around him a-considerable number of disciples . The implications of perfectionism are staggering . A person who is living a perfect life is incapable of sinning , according to Noyes , and his contention was that a state of perfection once reached could not be lost through any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely freed from the dominaLion of any law , command , custom , or institution . Such-a person is a law unto himself . He is his own interpreter of moral law , for any admission that the views of others are binding upon him would be an admission that some one else was more perfect than he . The perfectionist disregards the law of the state , for such a law is founded upon force or at least upon majority will . Thus perfectionism implies a condition of complete social and political anarchy . Nothing speaks more eloquently of the height reached by the reform movement and the open-mindedness of Americans during the  | thirties and the forties than the fact that these amazing doctrines were not laughed out of existence by " right-thinking " people . As a matter of fact Noyes made many converts , some of them in high places . Garrison became attached to the perfectionist theories , largely because Noyes stressed the abolition of churches along with all institutions that might ever attempt to guide the individual . In short perfectionism wiped the slate clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the removal of all possible restrictions on the perfect man . Obviously such a doctrine could receive fair trial in this far-fromperfect world only in a community where those perfected in the faith could live undisturbed by the worldly . Noyes saw this and began a community near Putney where the members could live according to their beliefs . In this community private property was unknown , the private home did not exist , the presence of the political state was unacknowledged , and all laws , ethical considerations , and moral codes were declared null and void . In spite of the absence of many institutions that society has known for long , the followers of Noyes were declared to be quiet , very peaceable , industrious , and intensely religious Opposition to the perfectionists developed in the village of Putney , and Noyes led his followers to Oneida , New York , where he founded the famous Oneida community that had so long and so flourishing an existence . Noyes avoided the economic mistake that so many American communists made , for he relied slightly on agriculture as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing and gradually evolved an industrial system that was admirably suited to such a group . After the Civil War , financial troubles never gave any further concern . Oneida was disbanded as a communism in 1879 , but it still flourishes as a joint stock company . Perfectionism merely carried to a logical conclusion many of the views and movements current in New England . Nearly all of the writers of the day came into contact with this strange , subversive doctrine , but few of them showed deep influence . The whole question of perfectionism is worthy of serious study , because the work of Noyes is a symptom of a widespread feeling that underlay much New England thinking .  | WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON ( 1805-1879 ) It should be borne in mind that the abolition of slavery was not the only reform proposed during the hectic years preceding the Civil War . It is true that abolition was probably the most important , certainly the most conspicuous , reform , but there were literally dozens of others , and very few of the reformers limited themselves to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abolitionists could be found on occasion promulgating temperance , woman 's rights , peace , or some other proposal , though each reformer usually had a main issue with a large number of sidelines . Garrison and Abolition. ? The most strident and insistent voice lifted against the institution of slavery in the United States was that of William Lloyd Garrison , otle of our few really great propagandists and journalists . Born in Massachusetts of miserably poor parents , he educated himself before the type-case in a newspaper office . Nature gave him a social conscience that would not hold its peace before any moral wrong , and a courage that rendered him immune to threats and intimidation . He perfected himself in the art of writing vivid , denunciatory English until his pen was feared more than that of any other man . With these qualifications , but without money , friends , or influence , Garrison flung himself upon the oldest and the most strongly entrenched social wrong in America . After serving an apprenticeship in a newspaper office and a term in the Baltimore jail for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1831 to preach the violently unpopular doctrine of abolition . Entirely repudiated by his own town and state , he kept doggedly at his work even though he was mobbed and almost killed in 1835 by a crowd of respectable Boston business and professional men . The southern states offered rewards for his delivery into the hands of their authorities , but still he kept indomitably at his self-chosen task . Slowly the sublime audacity of the man and his insistent calls to the humanitarianism of his readers won attention and converts to his cause . Other leaders came up , like Wendell Phillips , who shared the burden of leading the cause , and soon Garrison was at the head of determined and well-organized groups of men and women who preached the gospel of abolition without ceasing . By 184o the movement had gained the semblance of respectability ,  | and by 185o its work was done when the social conscience of the North became pretty well aroused . From that time the moral issue was superseded by the economic , and the appeal to the conscience was abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence of Garrison declined , but he published an issue of The Liberator every week until the close of the Civil War . As a propagandist and journalist Garrison rivals the best ever produced in America . By his very insistence he made people listen to his plea , by his fierce invective and fiery appeals to the moral sense of his readers he made converts of people who disliked him , but as a steady leader of a great popular movement he was impossible . And it was his very finest characteristics that made him impossible , - his idealism , his crusading spirit , and his habit of thinking of moral questions far in advance of the thought of his time . But for thirty-five years The Liberator called men to repent of the grievous sin of slavery , and at the end of its days the sin was no more . In his first number Garrison had said : I am aware that many object to the severity of my language ; but is there not cause for severity ? I will be as harsh as truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not wish to think , speak or write with moderation . . . . I am in earnest ? I will not equivocate ? I will not excuse ? I will not retreat a single inch ? and I will be heard . General Characteristics. ? As a political theorist Garrison was an extreme idealist . He based his whole politics on the Jeffersonian doctrine that all men are created equal and endowed with certain inalienable rights , and he thought that the proper place for the exercise of these rights was within a state whose powers were almost at the vanishing point . In fact after he met John Humphrey Noyes he accepted the perfectionist view that the state was an impertinent meddler n the affairs of an individual . Furthermore he was bitterly hostile to the political organizations existing in this country because all of them allowed or recognized slavery . Because of this fact , as well as because of his perfectionism , he spent much of his life in sharp opposition to all political organizations . At one time in the heat of the anti-slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death and an agreement with Hell . " His idealism blossomed in the philosophical anarchy of Thoreau and of perfectionism However , Garrison was no political theorist ; he was a moralist  | Political expediency meant less than nothing at all to the great abolitionist ; economic arguments infuriated him . Nothing mattered to him save the moral question involved . Harsh , unyielding , intolerant , violent , he might be called , but he was fighting an evil that had all the unlovely traits attributed to him , and he was striving to awake a public conscience that much preferred to slumber . Against such odds it is no wonder that his voice reached a strident pitch or that his temper frequently escaped control . He set his face against evil , and he would not be deterred . For three decades he was an Old Testament prophet , striding gauntly through the pleasant New England scene armed with the lash of truth and justice , and when he struck , he cared not whom he punished . But it is unfair to Garrison to present him solely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders of the sinful . He was literally forced into his extreme and violent outbursts because of his deep love for humanity ? a love that could not tolerate the thought of men suffering in human bondage . At the top of the first page of The Liberator he always carried a short motto borrowed from Thomas Paine , " Our country is the world ? our countrymen all mankind . " Underneath the harshness of the Hebraic prophet was a heart that beat with tenderness and pity for humanity , and not the least notable thing about Garrison is the fact that he could make the hearts of others beat in unison with his own . JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER ( 1807-1892 ) The fame of Garrison must of necessity be largely historical , for he wrote almost exclusively for the cause of abolition , and when the Emancipation Proclamation freed the slaves , his writings lost their appeal . On the other hand , Whittier , the poet of abolition , wrote a large number of poems that reflect the life of rural New England , and upon these rests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anti-slavery poems may be , they are all occasional , and when the specific occasion passed for which they were written , much of their interest perished . To the contrary , such a poem as " Snow-Bound " can never lose its interest so long as our taste allows us to enjoy the quiet and restrained presentation of simple life .  | Whittier the Abolitionist. ? Whittier came of a long line of Quaker ancestors , who accepted literally the doctrine of the inner light as the only true guide to one 's own action . This inner light was thought of as a bit of the divine spirit dwelling within man . Thus if all men are in constant communion with an immediate deity , all are equal in the most important sense . Furthermore the adherents of Quakerism are extreme individualists , fully tolerant of all other men and views , and wholly opposed to the use of force in any way . All these characteristics Whittier possessed as the heritage from his family . The abolition controversy often put a great strain on the doctrine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet 's personal attitude was one of gentle kindness . As a boy he received little education , a misfortune that undoubtedly did much to restrict the scope of his interests and performance . Evidently one of the strongest educational influences was the reading of a volume of Burns . The warm humanitarianism and the deep love for simple rustic life in the pages of the Scotch poet left their mark on much of Whittier 's work . The Quaker farm-boy began to write poetry early and had his first verses published in a paper edited by William Lloyd Garrison . In 1831 came his book , Legends of New England , the first volume of poetry published in the New England Renaissance . He became an editor and practical politician , and for a time contemplated a political career . This he resolutely put behind him in 1833 when he publicly avowed abolition sentiments . In that year he published a little volume of prose , Justice and Expediency , and signed the Anti-slavery Declaration . From this time on he was wholly allied with the abolitionists . He broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of political action . Garrison , as we have seen , was a perfectionist anarchist . Whittier , believing in the divine guidance of the inner light , naturally thought that elections could be made the voice of God , if only people would hearken to the spiritual voice within each one . Acting upon this belief he became one of the founders of the Liberty party that developed into the Free Soilers and later into the Republican party . Whittier 's abolition poetry comprises the greater part of all that he wrote , but few of the titles are read to-day . The stanzas to Garrison and " Massachusetts to Virginia " are assured of an immortality in our anthologies , but " Ichabod " deserves a higher place . This poem is a stinging rebuke to Webster when the Massachusetts sen-  | ator temporized with the slave power and made his infamous Seventh of March speech in advocacy of the fugitive slave law . It is hard to think of a more searing poetic censure than Whittier compressed in nine short stanzas . The poem is all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad-tempered line or a word of vituperation mars the rebuke . It comes from the pure heart of a man moved to deep righteous indignation and heavily burdened with sorrow and disappointment . Of its kind our literature has nothing finer . Certainly nothing that Whittier wrote better shows the spirit of the Quaker-reformer . Whittier as a Poet of New England. ? All through the abolition controversy Whittier was writing poetry of New England , and when the Civil e sat down to write his one undisputed masterpiece , " Snow-Bound ' In the last lines of the poem the author gives his work its best characterization , " Flemish pictures of old days , " for it is a quiet and homely presentation of a New England landscape and household during a snowstorm . The charming intimate descriptions of the people and of the life that they led have won the praise of successive generations of readers , and by none has it been more lauded than by those who best knew the life depicted . The idyllic rural note in . our literature just about reaches its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces by Whittier are not uniformly good . " Skipper Ireson 's Ride " has a note of crude authenticity about it that makes it very attractive to many people . " Cassandra Southwick " and " Amy Wentworth " have been much admired , but the famous " Maud Muller " is simply a poor poem with scarcely a redeeming feature . " The Barefoot Boy " has found its true level in our school readers , though it contains lines that indicate the poet 's native democracy . " Telling the Bees " is a graceful account of an old New England custom , and " The Huskers " with its closing section known as " The Corn Song " is another interpretation of the farm life.that the poet knew so well . Whittier was a self-trained man , but he totally neglected to train himself in the art of self-criticism . As a result his poetry , especially that dealing with his own life , displays a wide variety of excellence . However , at his best no one has approached him as the poet of rural New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in poetry . Some of this work is so good that it seems to occupy a permanent place in our hymnals . " Laus Deo " is an outburst of re-  | ligious joy upon the ratification of the constitutional amendment abolishing slavery . It is probably the best of the religious poems . " Margaret Smith 's Journal . " ? Whittier 's prose work that seems likely to live longest is a little book called Leaves from Margaret Smith 's Journal of the Province of Massachusetts Bay . This is an understanding and illuminating account of the life in Massachusetts in 1678 written from the standpoint of the gentle Quakers who were subject to great hardships and punishments . Recent investigation into the social history of the colony shows that Whittier 's understanding of conditions was extraordinarily acute and accurate . This book is worth reading for the expression of the Quaker spirit if not for the social history that it contains . General Characteristics. ? Although Whittier belongs squarely in the heart of the romantic movement by virtue of his mystical conception of human nature and of democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the humble life , it is probable that at least part of his work is not so hopelessly outmoded as is that of some of his contemporaries . The present-day interest in the lives of our ancestors and our admiration for records of the humble life of the past will pretty surely give such poems as " Snow-Bound " a long if not a permanent place in our literature . Certainly there are parts of the New England idyll that ought not to be forgotten . It is useless however to try to make out that Whittier is a great poet or even one of America 's major figures . His place is among the minor writers who have presented with truth and feeling the limited experiences that were theirs . His note is true , but it is never the utterance of a great poet . His feeling is often deep and sincere , but it is not the feeling of a sensitive artist of the first rank . MRS .

Her father was Lyman Beecher , a redoubtable defender of orthodoxy in Boston when the Unitarians were carrying all before them ; her brother was Henry Ward Beecher , the most successful emotional preacher of the  | time , whose sensational methods never kept him from preserving at least the name of orthodoxy ; her husband was Calvin Stowe , a more scholarly man than Lyman Beecher and even more firmly rooted in the Calvinism of the past . Old time Puritanism was in the very air that the woman breathed . Lyman Beecher took his college training under the famous guardian of orthodoxy , Timothy Dwight , and began preaching in Connecticut , the most conservative of all the states . He so distinguished himself by his opposition to all religious and political liberalism that in 1826 he was invited to Boston to combat the Unitarians on their home ground . He left there in 1832 , without having achieved notable success , to assume the presidency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West along with the remainder of the family . Here she was married to Dr. Stowe in 1836 , and in the following years became busied with the care of many children . During this time she had a good chance to observe slavery at close hand , for although Ohio was free territory , Kentucky with its thousands of slaves lay just across the river . Mrs. Stowe went with her husband in 185o to Maine , where he had accepted a position in Bowdoin College . " Uncle Tom 's Cabin.1850 was the date of the fugitive slave law , and it was this law that loosed Mrs. Stowe 's wrath against slavery . During 1851 and part of 1852 she wrote Uncle Tom 's Cabin , publishing it in the latter year . It was the most effective emotional protest ever made against slavery . This book visualized the evils of the system for northern readers who had been only momentarily stirred by Garrison , Phillips , Whittier , and the other agitators . Mrs. Stowe dramatized the sorrows of negroes and the inhumanity of the institution so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other one agitator was able to accomplish . Without the passage of the fugitive slave law that set off the explosion of Puritanical morality in Mrs. Stowe , the North might have remained unmoved against slavery until economic and political pressure became unendurable . The faults and excellencies of Uncle Tom 's Cabin are easy to enumerate . A hurried reading , however superficial , will show one that the book is carelessly written and hopelessly sentimental . No one could be expected to produce a faultless book with six children clamoring for attention . Besides , it was a first novel , although the author had written a collection of sketches almost ten years previously . But  | the major flaw in the book is its excessive sentimentality . It literally wallows in tears . There is no subterfuge and no artistry about appealing to the simplest emotions of the reader , but a direct attempt to touch one 's sympathy . Naturally the writer overstresses her case , exaggerates the conditions that she was attempting to depict , and creates her characters by so simple a method that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flesh and blood . Every one who has read the novel must have been struck by the fact that the characters are types and not individuals . Uncle Tom is not an individual negro but the typical faithful slave . Little Eva is not a personality but a type of innocence . Simon Legree is the typical villain . In drawing her characters thus Mrs. Stowe did- a common thing among American novelists . Types are more easily handled than are individuals , and the reader grasps their significance without effort . It is especially desirable to use them when the writer is interested in imparting an idea rather than in creating character . Since the American novelist has been very much interested in promoting ideas , the type has not passed , for some authors use their characters to illustrate psychological cases or laws . Hence all individualizing traits are omitted . However , some of the very faults of the book assisted in its successful appeal . The aim of the book was to create a moral revulsion , an emotional protest , against slavery . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appealed to the millions who read it only to become embittered against slavery . If the characters had been fully drawn , the average reader would have been so lost in a maze of psychological subtleties that he would have missed the aim of the writer . If there had been no exaggeration in the novel , its appeal would have been greatly curtailed , for the emotions of many are aroused only by a vigorous shaking . But above all these weaknesses that turned out to be strong points there is one characteristic that unquestionably made for success . That was the human element , the elusive quality that makes people interested in the actions and fate of characters . This quality Uncle Tom 's Cabin had in abundance . Uncle Tom 's Cabin is our first well-known sociological novel . Its aim was the remedying of a social wrong , and its method was the method of socially minded writers of more recent days . It is interesting to compare this book with other sociological studies like The Jungle by Upton Sinclair or Ernest Poole 's The Harbor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Stowe wrote  | more than fifty years earlier than the other two novelists , the modern reader has no trouble in awarding her a high rank for her emotional study of slavery . Mrs. Stowe as a Novelist of New England. ? Just as Whittier turned aside from the writing of abolition poetry to the description of New England life , so did Mrs. Stowe proceed from Uncle Tom 's Cabin and its successor Dred , a more reasoned anti-slavery argument , to a series of novels that lovingly displayed the homely virtues of Puritan New England . Probably the best known of these is Old Town Folks , a sketchy composition with many effective chapters that was composed from the boyhood recollections of the writer 's husband . Another is Poganuc People , a similar book made up of Mrs. Stowe 's own recollections . Still another is The Minister 's Wooing , a romance written about a personally likeable Puritan minister who preached the most amazingly terrifying theology and practiced the friendliest and most charming manners in his personal relations . In all these books Mrs. Stowe displays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her search for the human qualities of the Puritans whose worst side was exhibited in their harsh and crabbed theology . It is doubtful if Mrs. Stowe would have attracted a large audience by these works , but her position as a competent American novelist would be just as high to-day ff she had never written her anti-slavery stories . To say that Mrs. Stowe is a competent novelist is dismissing her without excessive praise . Her emotional argument against slavery is crude , but the next novel , Dred , is much better done , and the New England stories are extremely well written . Oldtown Folks and Poganuc People have just the right to remain in American literature that " Snow-Bound " has . All are made from the same cloth , and that cloth was woven of the life of old New England . THE GENTEEL TRADITION OF NEW ENGLAND Custom , sanctioned by school histories of literature , dumps Emerson , Thoreau , Mrs. Stowe , Whittier , Longfellow , Lowell , and Holmes into one large category and names them " The New England Writers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be very successfully impeached , but certainly geography is the only thing that they all have in common . The ideas of Emerson resembled those of Longfellow about as much as the democracy of Calhoun resembled  | that of Lincoln . Thoreau and Holmes were about as much alike as were Davy Crockett and Cooper . It is quite necessary to distinguish between the transcendentalists and reformers of New England and the members of the genteel school , Lowell , Longfellow , and Holmes , nor need the distinction be a fine one , for the differences are clear to any one who can read . The Brahmins , as the New England aristocrats are called , have always held themselves aloof from the middle-class Yankees . Family connections , money , and culture have long been considered the hallmark of Brahmin respectability . Behind this triple protection the upper class of New England society developed its inviolable code of customs and prejudices beside which it tests all things to determine if they are " respectable . " The touchstone of this respectability is the possession of good manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for appearances , and a genteel determination to admit the existence of nothing unpleasant . To the representatives of Brahminism , truth , to be acceptable , was required to stop short of the disconcerting or unpleasant fact , justice as a matter of social expediency ought not to violate any of the sacred taboos , and although it was theoretically desirable to see " God 's justice erected into human law , " it was not expected that any gentleman should demean himself by insisting too strongly that immediate steps be taken to effect the desirable end . Naturally the transcendentalists and reformers were too far from conforming to the Brahmin code to be acceptable in the high places of Harvard society or in the frigidly correct drawing rooms of the best Boston society . In 1838 Emerson gave the graduating class of the Harvard Divinity School an exposition of his idea of transcendental religion . It was one of his epoch-making utterances , but the result was that for almost thirty years thereafter he was not invited to speak on the campus of his university , although during that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one of our most popular lecturers . Thoreau angrily accused Lowell , one of the chiefest of Brahmins , of trying to blue-pencil one of his essays , and Lowell retaliated , after the death of Thoreau , in a critical appraisal that is the very essence of priggish misunderstanding . Theodore Parker was never admitted to the inner circle of Boston respectability , and down to our own generation there are detractors who deplore the man 's " bad manners " and " intemperate speech , " criticisms that imply that Parker excoriated evil , all apologists for evil , and especially those  | who closed their eyes and declared that they saw no evil . Garrison was the most unpopular man in New England ? though Alcott , Parker , and Emerson all claimed the same distinction ; his manners were " bad . " Wendell Phillips , the great orator of abolition , was the cause of much disappointment and sorrow among the Brahmins , for he deliberately deserted the upper class into which he was born and espoused the cause of noisy and " intemperate " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England romanticism met on a common footing , for Thoreau and Hawthorne were dead , Melville and Alcott were in abeyance , Garrison and the reform movement were extinct volcanoes , and Emerson 's individualism had been dulled by the passage of years . Longfellow and Lowell could afford to treat the survivors of the war and the industrial triumph with condescending respect ; the genteel tradition was well established in New England , and all America was taking its literary cue from Boston . However , the Genteel Tradition in letters had not been immune to the romantic revolution . It exalted a European background , but it insisted that such a background consist more of romantic legends and picturesque landscapes than of the ebullient romanticisms of French revolutionary philosophy or the spiny individualism of Godwin and Shelley . Rousseau 's appeal to Longfellow would have been negative , for the Frenchman warmly advocated the disavowal of the man-made culture that the Harvard professor found so comfortable and the substitution of a state of natural culture and equality , an idea abhorrent to the Brahmin . Europe was admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture to be acceptable in Boston had to be carefully selected and thoroughly denaturized . The Genteel Tradition accepted the optimism of romanticism , but washed out the buoyant jauntiness of Emerson and Whitman to a pallid hope that all would be well in due season if no one offended the sacred taboos . The guardians of the genteel , however , did accept the romantic version of religion in the shape of conservative Unitarianism , for oldtime Calvinism insisted on the very unpleasant fact that ninety per cent of men were to be everlastingly lost without regard to wealth or social status , and , as some wit has remarked , the Brahmins cheerfully insisted that they were too good to he damned . Unitarian the Brahmins were , for it was highly respectable to follow Channing and the other early romantics into the way of genteel religion , but Parker was wholly without the pale because of his insistence upon inter-  | preting questions of everyday politics and economics in terms of religion . The genteel could not echo Channing 's remark concerning Parker , " Let the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full heart implies the presence of an ecstasy that may disregard the canons of " respectability . " In short , the Genteel Tradition was romantic , but it demanded that its romanticism never disagreeably disturb the placid gentility of Brahminism by insisting upon a new way of life . HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW ( 1807-1882 ) In Longfellow New England Brahminism probably gave us its best product . He was born in Portland , Maine , of a well-to-do and strongly Federalist family . During his undergraduate days at Bowdoin , he showed such aptitude for foreign language and literature that the college offered him a professorship of modern language . In preparation for his work he spent three years in Europe , where he joyously discovered the picturesque legends and literature of the Continental countries . Returning to America he taught for a time at Bowdoin , leaving his alma mater to accept a chair at Harvard . A second trip to Europe gave him a fuller knowledge of his beloved field and led him into a study of the minor German writers whose sentimentalism greatly appealed to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Cambridge near the Harvard campus , where he lived for the remainder of his life . A second marriage in 1843 brought him wealth , domestic happiness , and an assured entrance into the best circles of Boston . There is no question about the popularity of Longfellow . He has even yet more readers than any other American poet can boast . During his lifetime his books sold as well in England as did those of Tennyson , and on the Continent he is read by school children from Paris to Constantinople , from Madrid to Leningrad . The reasons for this appeal to the general reader are not hard to find . Longfellow makes no demand upon the intellectual powers of his audience ; every idea is as easily grasped as are those of the Grimm brothers and Hans Christian Andersen . Again , his poems are always of the types that attract ordinary people . One of his favorite forms is that of a simple narrative , the story of which trips easily and gracefully along with the pleasant rhyme ; another form is the didactic poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple obvious virtues . However naive " The Psalm of Life " may be , it is pretty sure to retain its place in our anthologies and school readers so long as our people want their moralizing " done up in neat packages and tied with rhymes . " The very weaknesses of Longfellow ? his lack of ideas , his child-like simplicity , and his detachment from the deep and awesome problems of human life , all become elements of genuine strength in his appeal to the common men . It is as the poet of childhood and of the unsophisticated reader that Longfellow must take his place in literature , and a high place it is . However , to praise the poet for having written virtually all his work within the grasp of the grade school student is not all praise . Such a poem as " Paul Revere 's Ride " was aimed at the child reader , as " were- many others , but certain works like " Evangeline " that have since been taken over by children were written for mature readers . To write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to write a poem for mature readers and have it settle down to the level of the seventh-grade boy is quite another . But when all the adverse comments are over , it remains to be said that Longfellow is a part of the democratic culture of England and America , whatever that culture may be worth . Longfellow did a great service to his own time in making Americans acquainted with certain phases of European literature . Especially successful was he in his adaptations and translations of popular ballads from almost all nations of the Continent . He was the Chautauqua of his time . He brought culture to the stay-at-homes , not a very impressive culture , to be sure , not intellectual or disturbing to the petty round of duty that makes up life , but pleasant and gently insistent upon the homely virtues . Recent critics of Longfellow , searching diligently for something pleasant to say about our best known poet , have settled upon the sonnets with something like a sigh of relief . Certainly these poems can be praised with little reservation , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comedy . However , a comparison of these sonnets with Miss Millay 's " Euclid Alone Hath Looked on Beauty Bare " leaves the impression that Longfellow was hopelessly bookish . An attempt to compare him favorably with the great sonneteers of England may have a most laudable patriotic motive , but it certainly lacks convincing critical support . It is probable that bookishness , as much as lack of deep spirit  | ual interests , kept Longfellow from achieving a higher place in poetry . His references to nature are all taken from books and not from the sky and the fields and the moving water . His best poems reflect something that he has read and not something that he has felt . Professor Barrett Wendell expressed this criticism when , speaking of the academic note in Longfellow 's anti-slavery poems , he said : " One may fairly doubt whether in all anti-slavery literature there is a more humorous example of the way in which philanthropic dreamers often constructed negroes by the simple process of daubing their own faces with burnt cork . " The only criticism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face with black to create his poetic slave ; that method would have put too much of the personal element into the poem to suit the gentle poet . He merely used a black man that he had been reading about . Almost the clinching argument in favor of Longfellow 's overwhelming bookishness is to be found in his great number of translations that culminated in a new version of The Divine Comedy . Usually poets who can draw upon their own lives for material do not need to translate ; they have in their souls more poetry than they can ever write in a lifetime . It seems that Longfellow must go down in American literature as a minor poet who generally used insignificant material for his verses . There are adventures of the human soul that never were Longfellow 's . Not for him were the heights and depths of passion , righteous indignation , leaden-eyed despair , tumultuous ecstasy , or even the all-inclusive pity that blossoms.as gentle humanitarianism . All his emotions were second hand , bookish . For that reason he is read to-day most by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflective thought is slight . OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES ( 1809-1894 ) As a town wit whose reputation has become national and as a creator of light poetry , vers de societe , Oliver Wendell Holmes stands without a serious rival in our literature . He was the perfect columnist , who , if he were alive to-day , would revel in the conducting of a humorous column in a daily paper , like " The Conning Tower " of F. P. Adams . But Dr. Holmes lived before the days of personally conducted columns , and since he was too much given to jesting to  | attempt much literature on the grand scale and too serious-minded to sit down in his club and spend his life in delightful conversation , he never quite found his element . He wrote much light poetry , gave innumerable after-dinner speeches with most felicitous results , and in the Breakfast Table series put several hundred pages of conversation into print . The mutual admiration society that the Boston writers became after the Civil War extolled Holmes as a major figure , and it has remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deflating his reputation . To-day we rank him very high in his chosen field of literature , but it is surely not unkind to remember that one does not discuss a town wit as if he were a Shakespeare or even an Emerson . Like Longfellow , Holmes led a life too much sheltered from the intellectual breezes that were disturbing New England . He was born in Boston of a good family and received his degree from Harvard . After some indecision he studied medicine , rounding off his education with two and a half years in Paris . Upon his return to this country he taught for a time in Dartmouth , and beginning in 1847 he was for thirty-five years professor of anatomy and hygiene in the Harvard medical school . Holmes was happy in his work , in his domestic relations , and in his social contacts . To him Boston was in all seriousness the hub of the universe , and the Saturday Club , a social organization of distinguished men , was the very center of the hub . Never a ripple , save that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Romantic idealism meant nothing more than the subject of a clever jest . Holmes 's reputation seems to-day to rest upon a few poems and The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table . Time and critics uninfluenced by the genial doctor 's winning personality have not dealt kindly with the novels and the late/volumes of the Breakfast Table series . The poems that are best known , save the favorite " Chambered Nautilus , " are usually humorous or occasional . Holmes was in steady demand as a poet for class dinners and similar functions , and some of his happiest verse owes its inception to social obligations . Among the best known poems are " The Last Leaf , " " The Boys , " " The Height of the Ridiculous , " " The Ballad of the Oysterman , " and " The Deacon 's Masterpiece . " The last was published in the pages of The Autocrat of the-Breakfast Table . As a humorist Holmes has all the characteristics and all the tricks of the columnist . He likes witty epigrams , verse with a smile in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pun . His humor is quite without a sting , just as one would expect a poem or story to be that was composed with the idea of amusing every person present in a crowd . If he had been a satirist intent on chastising some of the follies or vices of society , his humor would not have had its pleasant flavor . Humor rightly employed is one of the most effective social weapons . Dr. Holmes never so employed his wit . He was content to make his readers smile . Reform he left to other hands . Holmes never carried his romanticism very far , save in the field of religion . The son of a minister , he was unalterably against the system of elder Calvinism , and for this outworn body of dogma he reserved the sharpest of his darts , and even they left slight stings as any one can see who reads " The Deacon 's Masterpiece . " As a physician he brought to a discussion of religion a certain flavor of rationalism that reminds one more of the eighteenth century than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection that Holmes had with the time of Pope and Queen Anne . He doted on the town wit style of the eighteenth century , on the pleasant but artificial society of the period that chatted its leisurely way through the years , and on the polished light verse of the time that frequently became clever . As a boy he read Pope 's translation of Homer , and the finished charm of the verse and the urbanity of style gave him a lasting taste for the age that produced it . JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL ( 1819-189I ) James Russell Lowell had more variety in his life and works than either Longfellow or Holmes could claim . He was born in the most correct circles of Brahminism where the political theory of Webster , the poetry of Pope , and the easy theology of moderate Unitarianism were alike accepted as superlative achievements in their respective fields . But in the " roaring forties " he ventured out of his sheltered haven and for more than a decade took all the stormy winds of New England romanticism . By the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his last thirty years were spent in a complacent contemplation of the Genteel Tradition and all its works . The Lowells have long been prominent in the affairs of Boston  | and Massachusetts . Of James Russell Lowell 's immediate family , the grandfather was a leading patriot in revolutionary days , the father occupied one of the important Unitarian pulpits of Boston , one uncle was an influential Federalist , and still another founded and gave his name to the factory city . A family of more dignity and honor it would have been hard to find in all Brahminism . After his graduation from Harvard in 1838 , James Russell Lowell deserted the comfortable precincts where his name meant so much and cast his lot for a time with the reformers and romantic idealists who were filling New England with so great a clamor . In 184o he met Maria White , poet , mild transcendentalist , and ardent abolitionist , who had by all accounts the better mind of the two , and under her tutelage he busied himself for more than a dozen years with the varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He never became a transcendentalist , but abolition claimed a prompt and warm adhermce . During these years he wrote the poems by which he is best known and a considerable amount of fiery prose that he later repudiated . Lowell and Maria White were married in 1844 . The next six years were his most productive period . By 185o he was beginning to weary of reform , and after Mrs. Lowell 's death in 1853 he swiftly declined to the placid indifference of his distinguished caste to social wrongs and proposed remedies . In 1855 Lowell succeeded Longfellow as professor of modern language in Harvard , a position that he held for twenty years . After quitting Harvard he was American minister to Spain and then to England , serving eight years in the diplomatic service . His last days were spent at Elmwood , his ancestral home in Cambridge , where he presided as the dean of American letters and issued his pontifical edicts on all questions of the day , civic as well as literary . When he died in 1891 the twilighl , of American romanticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation whose literary taste was formed on French and Russian realism and whose social and economic philosophy drew from sources utterly repugnant to the genteel . The early romanticism had passed in the triumph of industrialism , and with the death of Lowell even the Genteel Tradition was rapidly to become submerged under the flood of new ideas that poured into this country from 1885 to 1917 . The passing of Lowell meant the passing of an age . Lowell as a Poet. ? Lowell enjoyed his great poetic year in 1848 when he published " The Vision of Sir Launfal , " " A Fable for  | Critics , " and the first series of " The Biglow Papers . " These are the three poems by which he will probably keep his place in anthologies of American literature . " The Vision of Sir Launfal " is a thoroughly romantic production . It is a bit of New England moralizing placed in the form of a medieval legend and framed in some really good descriptive poetry of nature . The two preludes still retain their cultivated admirers and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be required to memorize the famous lines celebrating the perfection of a June day . Like so much of the poetry of the New England Renaissance , " Sir Launfal " is rarely read for the first time by the mature person ; its place is in the upper grades or the first years of highschool training . As a poem for that class of readers it is surely one of the most successful in our literature . In " A Fable for Critics " Lowell pays his respects in two thousand lines of poetry to all the contemporary writers , not overlooking himself . Lines from this poem are quoted whenever early American criticism is discussed . These are a few of the best known passages : There is Bryant , as quiet , as cool , and as dignified As a smooth , silent iceberg , that never is ignified , Save when by reflection ' t is kindled o ' nights With a semblance of flame by the chill Northern Lights . If I call him an iceberg , I do n't mean to say There is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is almost the one of your poets who knows How much grace , strength and dignity lie in Repose . There is FIawthorne , with genius so shrinking and rare That you hardly at first see the strength that is there ; A frame so robust , with a nature so sweet , Is worth a descent from Olympus to meet . There comes Poe , with his raven , like Barnaby Rudge , Three-fifths of him genius , the two-fifths sheer fudge . There is Whittier , whose swelling and vehement heart Strains the strait-breasted drab of the Quaker apart . Sometimes the humor is not so gentle as when the author pays his respects to Margaret Fuller , for that rather waspish lady had vig-  | orously criticized him for certain poetic shortcomings , and Lowell was anxious to repay in her own coin . " A Fable for Critics " is a medley of sophomoric poetry , clever wit , and sound sense . Some of the lines are inexcusably crude and amateurish , and others are excellent tabloid criticism . A drastic revision would have helped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-criticism . He wrote hurriedly under the impulse of momentary nervous energy , and when the burst of energy disappeared , there remained not even the ability to read critically what he had previously written . The first series of " The Biglow Papers " seems to-day to be the best thing that Lowell ever did . The Mexican War aroused all the fighting abolition spirit that the poet possessed , and his indignation welled over in these poems that give in native Yankee dialect and mother wit the homely and pointed objections to foreign conquest for the benefit of the slave power . The second series , written at the time of the Civil War , has its effective moments , but as a whole it is inferior to the earlier production . Some of the shorter poems of Lowell are general favorites . " The Present Crisis , " a piece of rousing rhetoric inspired by the anti-slavery struggle , is still read and quoted . " To the Dandelion , " " The First Snow-fall " and " The Shepherd of King Admetus " still have their places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Rhoecus " are worthy of serious attention . The poems written after i86o , mostly occasional and commemorative verse , reflect far too plainly the author 's feeling that he is expected to do something dignified and profound . The best of these is the Harvard " Commemoration Ode " with its justly admired tribute to Lincoln , but even this poem seems to-day to lack the dignity and effectiveness that once were so much praised . Formerly " The Cathedral " had many admirers , but it is significant that the most recent collections of American poetry for college use omit this effot . Lowell as a Critic. ? After 1855 Lowell gave more and more of his attention to critical work . During his twenty years at Harvard the most important of his essays dealt with literary subjects , but in the last period of his life he divided his time between literature and public questions . As a literary critic Lowell is the subject of a considerable amount of contemporary debate . His detractors allege that he said nothing  | new , that his approach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the scholar , and that he showed timidity and a lack of interest in his own age by sticking to the classical figures in literature rather than attempting an appraisal of less known writers . The charges can be substantiated . Most of the literary essays were dashed off during his teaching days as visible proof that the writer had not succumbed to his indolence . They were largely the material given to his undergraduate classes in Harvard . Now there is one test and one only of the classroom critic . He must always be judged by the success that he achieves in making his students want to read the literature that he talks about . The men who were in Lowell 's classes testify to the interest in reading that their teacher inspired , but a good classroom lecture does not always make a permanent contribution to the subject under discussion . Lowell probably should not have published some of his essays . As lectures they were successful , but as printed studies they are not so highly regarded . As a critic of contemporary questions Lowell can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pronouncements on classical literature . The essay on Thoreau is a masterpiece of misunderstanding and muddleheaded thinking , but for forty years it blasted the fame of its subject , and even to-day our histories of literature show the effect of this essay by a consistent belittling of Thoreau and by a complete misinterpretation of the man 's work . The publication of that essay was one of the many tragedies of American literature . Furthermore , as a contemporary critic Lowell had great limitations . For instance , he disliked and disregarded the work of Taine , the great French historian and critic of literature , one of whose critical contributions was the theory that literature is a direct product of race , time , and environment . To-day Taine is regarded as the founder of one of the schools of criticism , but Lowell gave the Frenchman 's theories only a condescending notice followed by a curt dismissal . In his discussion of public affairs Lowell resolutely set his face against innovation , contending that , while matters were not proceeding very satisfactorily , further tampering with social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years of his life were spent in the Gilded Age , an era of unparalleled corruption in American public life . The small farmers of the West were vehemently pointing out the causes and cure of the ills that beset the body politic , and the workingmen of the cities were even more noisily  | directing attention to their grievances by the very effective use of strikes and boycotts . Lowell shut tight the doors of his study against the entrance of either faction . The agrarian agitation he condemned as the brazen efforts of dishonest men to get what was not rightfully theirs . The demands of labor found him as hostile ; no use had he for the eight-hour day , but only a contempt for the man who " pretends to believe that eight is equal to ten . " Agitation in England to extend the suffrage drew from him the grave warning that such a step might be attended by immediate danger . It has been said that Lowell 's essays on political subjects are " indispensable to an American . " They are quite indispensable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of modern democracy can be perverted by the Brahmin brain . It is probable that the trouble with Lowell 's later utterances is the fact that our nation traveled too rapidly from 1855 to 1870 for the pace of a sedate professor . The triumph of industrialism and the Civil War loosed a welter of get-rich-quick enterprises and corrupt politics . Under the brazen leadership of such unlovely characters as Daniel Drew and Jim Fisk , American business dropped its pretensions to decency and became a thing dedicated to exploitation by the financial pirate who scuttled corporations and cut individual purse-strings with neither fear nor compunction . Corruption spread from our local and state governments to the higher circles of national administration . Lowell saw all this and was troubled . He was a high-minded man who desired most of all common decency in the conduct of affairs , and common decency was then the scarcest commodity in all America . In his confused search for a remedy for the distressing condition Lowell naturally went to the ideals of his class ; for Brahminism , although not productive of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least was honest and scrupulous of appearances .

The culture of centuries gone is to be used reverently but judiciously , he continued , never is it to be allowed to cabin and confine the human spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant of the thoughts of the past , but to allow the ideas of the past to force us into stereotyped thinking . Then Emerson proceeds to give the creed by which the American scholar and literary man should be guided . " We will walk on our own feet ; we will work with our own hands ; we will speak our own minds . " These inspiring words , spoken in 1837 and dropped on the transcendental seed-bed of the New England mind , were certainly not without their effect , but it was not until 1855 , when the first issue of Walt Whitman 's Leaves of Grass came from the press , that an American writer . took the declaration at its full value and proceeded to speak his own mind in native words . As Thoreau lived the life that Emerson advocated , so did Whitman write the poetry that the Concord prophet had predicted . Whitman spoke his own mind in Leaves of Grass . It was original ; nothing quite like it had previously appeared in the world of literature . To-day we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual fashion many things found in Emerson 's essays , but the startling ideas of transcendentalism were so expressed in the new book that they seemed wholly original and far more startling than those of Emerson and Thoreau . The towering egotism of the poet overwhelmed people . Here was a man who spoke of himself by name in his own poetry , and the longest and most characteristic poem was called " Song of Walt Whitman , " afterwards changed to " Song of Myself . " This frank egotism was bad enough , but far worse , even unspeakable , was the nonchalant way in which the poet had celebrated the body as well as the soul , declaring that the body  | and all its physical members were as sacred as the spirit of the individual . This declaration was only Rousseau 's views on the sanctity of the natural man carried to their plain conclusion , but it was a new thing in poetry . And such poetry ! It had neither rh ; me tenor meter , nor nicely constructed figures of speech , nor anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And such words ! The nineteenth century poet was supposed to have a special vocabulary that no one else ever used . It abounded in " poetic " phrases and figures of speech and quite omitted the homely Anglo-Saxon monosyllables of everyday speech . That was only another tradition that Whitman fractured . His words were taken from the lips of bus drivers , street-car conductors , carpenters , politicians , tramps , loafers , and obscure Americans of every type . Truly the book had all the outward appearance of an original work . Immediately the argument began . The Genteel Tradition gave its most genteel shudder and either answered the book with a stony silence or declared that it was utterly lacking in importance . Whittier cast his copy of the book into the fire ; the natural man was too much for him . Before reading the poems Lowell declared offhand that this sort of thing " wo n't do , " and if he ever afterwards altered his views he refrained from making a public recantation of his error . Some of the newspaper critics denounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insufferable indecencies . One outraged gentleman recommended the whipping-post as the reward of the author . Other commentators timidly approved , though they were confused as to the author 's meaning . In all the riot of noise and argument , a few clear voices were raised in defense of the poems . These were the voices of the transcendentalists who recognized in Leaves of Grass the fruition of their own strivings and the poetic statement of their own teachings . Emerson approved of the book . Thoreau and Alcott , even more enthusiastic , made a trip to Brooklyn to meet the author , and several members of the group sensed that Walt Whitman was really one of themselves . The argument thus inaugurated continued for many years , but to-day the detractors of Whitman are only a few feeble and very academic critics . Every commentator of intelligence admits the power and significance of Leaves of Grass , and not many are disposed to question the influence of the book upon our literature . But when it comes to attributing a final position to the poet , critics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take rank  |  beside the supremely great poets of all time , beside Dante , Homer , and Shakespeare , or is he to find his place beside those men who have finely summarized their time as did Milton , Wordsworth , Spenser , Shelley ; or is he merely a stimulating influence in a new field , a pioneer like Burns with all the crudities and good qualities of this type ? These questions are fruitful subjects for speculation , but they are not to be answered . In the final appraisal of Whitman , this generation is not saying the last word ; that task must be delegated to later ages . The purpose of the present slight discussion is to consider Whitman as the last and the most fluent of the transcendentalists and as the epitome of the Golden Day of American romanticism with all the bombast , all the ennobling ideals , and all the chaotic strivings of its newly released human spirit . In the man who sets for himself the appalling task of speaking for a nation in a great hour , inconsistencies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Very well then I contradict myself , ( I am large , I contain multitudes ) In Whitman one finds the pioneer of the West and the teeming life of the city , the egotism of the assertive individualist and the quick pity of the humanitarian , the song of Walt Whitman and the chant of praise for democracy , the highest flights of poetry yet attained by an American and the repellent anatomical details of the autopsy . Yet when all the conflicting elements are set forth , it remains that the inconsistencies of Leaves of Grass are those of a transcendentalist and that the contradictions are those of romantic America . His book is not " chaos of death ? it is form , union , plan ? it is eternal life ? it is happiness . " But the form , the life , and the happiness are those of our Golden Day , foregathered in the capacious embrace of Walt Whitman . If Whitman can be summarized in a few words , his message is that of Emerson made only a little more spacious . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of the individual . Lie Emerson 's this individualism was based on a p ion of human nature that made Walt Whitman the very center of the universe and wholly identified him in the spirit with every other individual who in turn was the center of a universe just as real and as meaningful as that of Whitman . Every human  | being was the poet in another guise . The reader must make a reconciliation of this individualism and this mystic brotherhood of man in order to understand Leaves of Grass , for the poems vacillate between praise of Whitman , the individual , and triumphal paeans to democracy . No one recognized this fact better than did the author , for with these clearly explanatory words he makes his bow to the world : One's-self I sing , a simple separate person , Yet utter the word Democratic , the word En-Masse . Of physiology from top to toe I sing , Not physiognomy alone nor brain alone is worthy for the Muse , I say the Form complete is worthier far , The Female equally with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulse , and power , Cheerful , for freest action form 'd under the laws divine , The Modern Man I sing . Life of Whitman. ? Walt Whitman was born on Long Island at the little village of West Hills . His parents were of the ordinary American type , distinctly middle class . The father was a farmer whose very moderate success in getting a livelihood out of the soil for his nine children was indicated by his removal to Brooklyn . In the city he worked as carpenter and contractor . The mother , who was a Quaker , seems to have had a great influence on her poet-son . The second boy , Walt , so called to distinguish him from his father who was named Walter , received a rather hasty and incomplete education , however not sa incomplete that he could not later teach country school for a time . Although the family lived in the city , Walt took many opportunities to spend much time in rural Long Island . After his schooling was over , he was there frequently for months at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply " loafing and inviting his soul . " In his teaching he is said to have resembled Alcott in his refusal to use force and in his appeal to the better instincts of his pupils . After a few years of desultory life on Long Island , during which time he came into close contact with the common people whose aspirations and ideals he afterwards so triumphantly expressed , Whitman went to Brooklyn where he worked as a journalist for a number of years . This period of his life was rounded off by two years of service as editor of the Bro , 6klyn Eagle . By this time , 1848 , Whitman was fixed in his political and social  | views , As a democrat he was of the line of Jefferson and Lincoln , taking a firm stand against southern slave-holders in their efforts to open the western territories to their peculiar institution . However , his democracy differed a bit from that of his two great prototypes in that it sprang as much from association with the workingmen in the cities as from friendship for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitman 's political views . He was a member of the Democratic party and prominent in its councils , but when that organization swung to the support of slavery , he joined the radicals . For doing so he lost his editorial position . In his fundamental political philosophy he was very much like Jefferson , holding always that that government is best which governs least . He rested his hope for the future on the Westerners and city laborers . " Radical , true , far-scoped and thorough-going democracy may expect great things from the West , " he once remarked . He admired the West so much that he declared that there is something refreshing even in the extremes of western character . Whitman 's career during the years 1848-1855 was long uncertain , and even yet not all the facts are determined , though we are now sure that these were among his most important years . Soon after quitting the Brooklyn Eagle , he accepted a place with a New Orleans paper . In his new home his chief experience was a love affair , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the experience of love a mystic kinship with all mankind . He further gained from his stay in the South an augmented opposition to slavery , because he saw more plainly than ever before that the western pioneer , capable and self-reliant as he was , could not compete with the slave power in the settlement of new regions . Slavery was economically ruinous to the free settler . After a few months in New Orleans Whitman went back to Brooklyn as a Free Soil editor . Again politics threw him out of work , and he took at least one more trip to the South . Then he worked in Brooklyn for a time as a carpenter and extended his acquaintance among the bus drivers , ferry-men , laborers , and floaters of the city . His fundamental equalitarianism , his constant association with the practical exponents of democracy , and his recent political and personal experiences all set him to thinking . Into the ferment of thought thus started entered the stimulating teaching of Emerson . About 1853 Whitman read Emerson 's essays , and for two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already contemplated for six years .  | In July , 1855 , Leaves of Grass was published with the results previously described . In 1856 and in 186o new editions appeared . In the meantime Whitman had gone to the support of the new Republican party in its opposition to the slave power . When the war broke out the poet showed that his humanitarianism was not merely theoretical by volunteering as a hospital nurse and caring for wounded and sick soldiers with so great a devotion that he permanently injured his own health . There is nothing finer in the history of selfsacrificing idealism than the story of Whitman as the volunteer nurse , supplying the wounded with tobacco , dressing wounds , reading the Bible to dying Protestant boys , looking through the city to find a priest for expiring Catholic soldiers , buying freezers of ice cream to treat a whole ward , interceding with incompetent medical directors to make another ? and successful ? effort to save a leg that they had decided must be amputated , and doing the thousand things that an energetic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whitman asserted after the war that he had probably met 8o,000 men in his work . Many of these remembered him with deepest affection . After the war , the poet obtained a clerkship with the Interior Department as clerk in the Bureau of Indian Affairs . He was dismissed from this position because the secretary of the interior , his superior , objected to certain passages in Leaves of Grass . However , a place was found for him in the attorney general 's office where he remained for eight years . His work here was ended by a stroke of paralysis . For the remainder of his life he lived in Camden , New Jersey , where he died in 1892 . Whitman , the Transcendentalist. ? The influence of Emerson upon Whitman was deep and enduring , and Emerson was the chief of American transcendentalism . Leaves of Grass shows unmistakably transcendental paternity in its conception of human nature , its optimism , its idea of nature , its tolerant individualism that created democracy , and especially in the mystical background of its whole thought . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a record of Whitman 's conversations covering only a little more than a year , Emerson is mentioned about two hundred times . Writing once of the Concord teacher the poet said : " He pierces the crusts that envelop the secrets of life . He joins on equal terms the few great sages and original seers . He represents the freeman , America , the individual . " Again he said : " Em-/  | erson is great ? oh ! very great : he was a far reaching force ; a star of the first , the very first magnitude , maybe ; without a doubt that . " In the 1856 edition of the Leaves of Grass he spoke of Emerson 's work in awakening a new social conscience in America : " Those shores you found . I say you have led the States there ? have led me there . I say that none has ever done or ever can do a greater deed for the States than your deed . " Writing to Whitman in July , 1855 , the month of the publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not blind to the worth of the wonderful gift of Leaves of Grass . I find it the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed . I am very happy in reading it , as great power makes us happy . . . I give you joy of your free and brave thought . . . . I find incomparable things said incomparably well , as they must be . . . I greet you at the beginning of a great career . . . . The solid sense of the book is a sober certainty . It has the best merits , namely of fortifying and encouraging . In the height of his rapture over Leaves of Grass , Emerson exclaimed : " Americans who are abroad may now return : unto us a man is born . " Emerson probably was never so enthusiastic about another book ; well might he be enraptured , for he was applauding his own intellectual offspring . Such lines as the following are undiluted Emersonian doctrine : I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by , after all ) Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids , conformity goes to the fourth-remov 'd , I wear my hat as I please indoors or out . It is perfectly true that Whitman might have reached his distinctive views without having read Emerson , for transcendentalism was rife in the very air of America during the forties , but the fact remains that he did not . He read Emerson and acknowledged his indebtedness to him in a public utterance , and Emerson acknowledged his approval of the doctrine in Leaves of Grass by a letter of warm appreciation . In Thoreau , Whitman had even a more intense admirer than he found in Emerson . For this there was a reason . Thoreau was much  | more of a natural man than Emerson was , more like a wild animal , more in love with the ecstasy of living . He was enough of a child of nature not to be frightened by a catalog of anatomical names , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his kind when he saw it . Emerson once wrote in his journal : " Perhaps his Thoreau 's fancy for Walt Whitman grew out of his taste for wild nature , for an otter , a woodchuck , or a loon . " Whitman 's poems are filled with lines that , but for their rhetorical peculiarities , might easily fit into Walden or the Week . Thoreau 's disdain for money and the material things of life are echoed in : " And you or I pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth . " The intense individualism which found the whole universe in a Concord bean-field , even under one 's very hat-brim , would be satisfied with this declaration of the importance of self : I exist as I am , that is enough , If no other in the world be aware I sit content , And if each and all be aware I sit content . One world is aware and by far the largest to me , and that is myself . He who came into the world " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would find a congenial spirit in Whitman , who declared himself to be " the caresser of life wherever moving , " and all transcendentalists in New England and elsewhere must have found epitomized in the following lines their mistrust of formal learning , their joy in simple life and occupations , and their abounding egotism : And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the learning of all times , And there is no trade or employment but the young man following it may become a hero , And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel 'd universe , And I say to any man or woman , Let your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes . Whitman 's Mysticism. ? Like all the transcendentalists Whitman based his whole workaday philosophy on a . profoundly mystical basis . From his mother , a good Quaker , he received the belief that " the unseen is proved by the seen , " that the inner light , the intuition , is the safest guide to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all men in Him .  | Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all arguments of the earth , And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own , And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own , And that all the men ever born are also my brothers , and the women my sisters and lovers , And that a kelson of the creation is love ... Again : Why should I wish to see God better than this day ? I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four , and each moment then , In the faces of men and women I see God , and in my own face in the glass , I find letters from God dropt in the street , and every one is sign 'd by God 's name , And I leave them where they are , for I know that wheresoe'er I go , Others will punctually come forever and ever . The mystical aspects of transcendentalism could not be more clearly stated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God in every human being and the ability of each to receive messages directly from the Deity at all times . To the person who holds such a view and allows it to others , as Whitman did , equalitarian democracy is not a vague possibility or a desirable though remote ideal but rather a necessity based upon the sacred duty of allowing each man to follow and express the divinity that is within him . Twenty years after the first edition of Leaves of Grass Whitman again uttered his belief in the divine origin of the inner light , the still small voice of the conscience : O I am sure they really came from Thee , The urge , the ardor , the unconquerable will , The potent , felt , interior command , stronger than words , A message from the Heavens whispering to me even in sleep , These sped me on . . . . ... Thou 0 God my life hast lighted , With ray of light , steady , ineffable , vouchsafed of Thee . . . . Such a mystical conception of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a practical consideration ; it is an attitude of mind which colors all facts that come into its influence . The mystical union is not regarded as the exclusive prerogative of any one  | man or group of men . It is a universal possibility , and if man errs it is simply because he does not follow the plain guidance of the light within . By bringing the individual into direct communication with God , it creates a tremendous individualism , but by allowing to all men the same relations with God it makes a complete spiritual equalitarianism , a firm and sure basis for equalitarian democracy , both spiritual and political . Whitman does not allow his estimate of human nature to be implied in a general statement of his mysticism . Again and again he explicitly declares his faith in the indwelling presence of God , and beseeches all men to remember that their bodies are temples of the divine spirit . None has begun to think how divine he himself is . Upon a battle field the body of his slain enemy moves him to pity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself is dead . Nowhere does the seen mirror the unseen more accurately than in the relations of the soul and body . Was somebody asking to see the soul ? Behold the body includes and is the meaning , the main concern , and includes and is the soul ; Whoever you are , how superb and how divine is your body , or any part of it . Again : I have said that the soul is not more than the body , And I have said that the body is not more than the soul , And nothing , not God , is greater to one than one 's self is . This close interlinking of the soul and the body and the rapture over the divinity of man 's physical structure led to the fleshliness and primitiveness that have repelled so many from Whitman 's poetry . In the closing section of the " Song of Myself " the poet says : I too am not a bit tamed , I too am untranslatable , I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other lines of his poetry . The genteel , impressed by the wildness of his " barbaric yawp , " have set him down as the defiant apologist of sheer  | animalism , and with this estimate have condemned his verses to the limbo of unspeakable indecencies . In his self-characterization Whitman was guilty of poetic exaggeration , for he is perfectly translatable , and his most barbaric passages are merely glorifications of the physical body as the divine home of the soul . Whitman is no more indecent than a book on physiology is indecent . He only permitted to " speak at every hazard nature without check with original energy . " Concerning this aspect of Leaves of Grass Thoreau makes the best criticism : " As for the sensuality of Whitman 's Leaves of Grass I do not so much wish that it was unwritten , as that men and women were so pure that they could read it without harm . " In short , Whitman had the transcendental view of human nature . He considered it divine , and he went one step beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soul , is equally divine with the spirit . The individual considered alone is divine , and no less divinity attends him in the democratic mass , the congregation of the common man . Furthermore , the best moral guide of man is the individual conscience , the voice of God , which always attends every man , whether he be a solitary figure or one of a huge society . Whitman 's View of Nature. ? Just as Whitman and the transcendentalists were one in their conception of human nature , so did they agree upon a mystical interpretation of the relations of man and the natural world . " Letters from God dropt in the street " are merely manifestations of God in nature , and since the poet found these everywhere , he was at no more of a loss than Emerson was to find the Deity in the landscape itself and in every detail of that landscape . The most universal and insignificant thing , equally with the most conspicuous object , became the messenger of God . A child said What is the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the handkerchief of the Lord , A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt , Bearing the owner 's name someway in the corners . . . . I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars , And the pismire is equally perfect , and a grain of sand , and the egg of a wren , And a tree-toad is a chef-d'oeuvre for the highest , And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven , And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery , And the cow crunching with depress 'd head surpasses any statue , And a mouse is a miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels.  | Furthermore just as a mystic of the Whitman variety looks upon other men and sees in them resemblances to himself , becomes part of them and makes them part of him , so he becomes a part of the nature around him . There was a child went forth every day , And the first object that he look 'd upon , that object he became , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain part of the day , Or for many years or stretching cycles of years . One of the most characteristic minor aspects of transcendental literature is the frequently expressed rapturous delight in the external beauty of nature . Whitman frequently voices the same delight . " The earth never tires , " he declared , rejoicing in the beauty of the physical scene , and in the quiet of the night he absorbed immortality and peace . With Emerson he testifies that " The air tastes good to my palate , " and like his teacher in the transcendentalism of nature , he realized the fullness of his individuality only in the presence of the natural world . We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun , We found our own , 0 my soul , in the calm and cool of the day-break . The Optimism of Whitman. ? The size and grandeur of Whitman 's scope can be seen nowhere better than in his optimism . My foothold is tenon 'd and mortis 'd in granite , I laugh at what you call dissolution , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foolish chattering over Whitman 's " jaunty , backslapping optimism " would never have come into being if the critics had read those three lines which have the radiance and repose of eternity itself . Such lines can come only from a soul that is sustained by a quiet but unshakable faith that all will be well in God 's own good time . No flamboyance is here , but only a steady belief in the final goodness of man and the beneficence of the universe in which we live . In the face of so much goodness and in the prospect of the final triumph of good , " . the wonder is always and always how there can be a mean man or an infidel . " Whitman 's universe is good without reservation . In fact at times he is inclined to say that there is no evil . The poet who can sing : " All seems beautiful to me " should be pardoned for a bit of exuberant joy , because he  | is an antidote for the excessive pessimism that to-day is almost universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimism did not seem excessive . To-day any cheerful note sounds " jaunty " by comparison with the prevailing mood . It would be well if we could stop talking about Whitman 's optimism for a time , and consider it as transcendental idealism grappling with the problem of death and evil . In such a light Leaves of Grass drops much of its " jauntiness " and becomes a grave and reverent defense of man 's right to hope in his most critical hours . So divine a thing as human nature was not meant for annihilation , says the poet , and some of his most memorable passages bid humanity to take heart even when in the grip of the last enemy . The smallest sprout shows there is really no death . . . . All goes onward and outward , nothing collapses , And to die is different from what anyone supposed , and luckier . Again : I know I am deathless , I know this orbit of mine can not be swept by a carpenter 's compass , I know I shall not pass like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . Nothing can shake so great a faith and so steady a confidence in the goodness of life and death . Sorrow and disaster become straws on the current that is slowly but irresistibly moving toward ultimate triumph . And as to you death , and you bitter hug of mortality , it is idle to try to alarm me . The peace that passes understanding has come upon the poet , and " no array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and about death . " Why should he not be at peace ? God dwells in him and he in God , and death has vanished utterly before the calm face of high idealism . Whitman 's Cosmic Significance. ? " Cosmic significance " has for long been a favorite phrase of the friendly critics of Whitman , and so ponderously have they labored the rather cryptic characterization that they have almost submerged their ideas under a deluge of polysyllables . Cosmic means universal , and the whole phrase at-  | tempts to give in tabloid form the reasons for the poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitman could speak for all men because of his " cosmic significance " ? he was the universal man . " Walt Whitman " stood for more than the Brooklyn editor and carpenter ; it stood for every separate unit of the human race just as did the term " man . " It represented the free man and the slave , the black and the white , the Southerner and the Northerner , the city dweller of the East and the trapper of the West , the American and the European . It was in the completest sense a universal term . Some of the difficulty with " cosmic significance " has been caused by the egotism of Leaves of Grass . Whitman was a rank egotist ; he recognized that fact in many a passage , but his individualism stopped short of the cave-man variety that must kill , maim , or conquer every other individual in the world besides himself . Such lines as these are not calculated to impress any one with Walt Whitman 's insignificance : Having pried through the strata , analyzed to a hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find no sweeter fat than sticks to my - own bones . Or these : I am larger , better than I thought , I did not know I held so much goodness . But one can never insist too strongly that any claim made by Whitman might also be made with his approval by any man anywhere . In fact he insists upon making it for his mute brethren : And what I assume you shall assume , And every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you . Again : In all people I see myself , none more and not one a barley-corn less , And the good or bad I say of . myself I say of them . Or this : My spirit has pass 'd in compassion and determination around the whole earth , I have look 'd for equals and lovers and found them ready for me in all lands , I think that some divine rapport has equalized them with me.  | But Whitman does not allow his universality and his deep feeling for innate equality to be spent in mere political or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical fulfillment in a rich humanitarian , ism that some have thought is Whitman 's finest bequest to literature . Behold , I do not give lectures or a little charity , When I give I give myself . Or this : I know perfectly well my own egotism . . . And would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself . Too often a laudable humanitarianism has been lavished upon those who are not particularly needing it or upon the respectable element in our society . Such was not the case with Whitman . The outcast , the despised , the law-breaker , the unfortunate he held in his vast embrace , never refusing his mercy to a one . " Not until the sun excludes you do I exclude you , " he assured an outcast , and the deeper the agony the quicker and the more complete the response : Agonies are one of my changes of garments . If there is any Puritanism to be found in Whitman it appears in the form of an insistence upon the duty of every man to cultivate a ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brotherhood of universal man . " Whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own funeral dressed in his shroud , " he once declared , and in speaking of an unfortunate he says , " I am the man , I suffer 'd , I was there . " One can take with a good grace many lectures from Whitman on humanitarianism and the beauty of sympathy , for the poet freely spent his health during the Civil War ministering to the sick and wounded in the crowded hospitals . His actions during those grim days were a heartening demonstration of the doctrine that he had just been preaching in Leaves of Grass . Whitman and the Frontier. ? In a very true sense Whitman 's mystical equalitarianism , his sympathy , and his other romantic traits epitomize the spirit of the western frontier . Although the poet saw rather little of the West , he was wholly in sympathy with its social and political aspirations . He saw the economic reason for western opposition to slavery , and he became successively an anti-slavery Democrat , a Free Soiler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The spirit of the West is plain in Leaves of Grass and in  | almost any of the prose , and the facts of Whitman 's political career have been public property for a number of years . What is not even yet so well recognized is the fact that the poet found in the cities a new frontier , very much like that one which was receding into the West so rapidly . Without a doubt the city frontier does resemble our historical line of settlement as much as a crowded tenement can resemble open land , as much as a factory can resemble a homestead . The spirits of the city laborer and the frontiersman are much alike . Much alike also are the aspirations of the two men . Each is greatly concerned with economics . The frontiersman demands social and political equality , by which he thinks to have a chance to possess the economic resources of the frontier on an even footing with his fellows ; the city laborer also wants equality , political , at least , for by this means only can he gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage in a reasonably permanent position . In choosing social and political leaders both men are alike in their contempt for the pretensions of birth and culture when unsupported by other qualifications . Both prefer the practical man of affairs who can do things to the theorist , however intellectual he may be , and both are very liable to succumb to the appeals of the demagogue . For a hundred years the tone of American democracy was set by the Vest . Although the city man united with the frontier to elect Jackson and Lincoln , so predominant was the voice of the Westerner in our politics that insufficient credit was given to the laborer for his share in the victories . Since r900 the voice of the city is becoming more and more noticeable in party councils , and with the rush of our people to the large centers of population it is safe to say that the American democracy of the future will be determined on our new frontier , the large city with its teeming laboring population . Although Whitman did not sit down and reason out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he was not a reasoning man , he sensed these similarities and as the poet of American democracy put into his ample lines the songs of the commoners , wherever they might chance to live . 0 such themes ? equalities ! 0 divine average . " Memories o f President Lincoln . " ? Whitman gained two sections of Leaves of Grass from his Civil War experiences . The first of these , " Drum-Taps , " gave his direct reactions to the great conflict  | and the sights that he saw on the battle fields and in the hospitals . Among the most admired poems in this group are " Beat ! Beat ! Drums ! " " Strange Vigil I Kept on the Field One Night , " " The Wound-Dresser , " " Give Me the Splendid Silent Sun , " and " Ethiopia Saluting the Colors . " But the two master works from the war are to be found in the section called " Memories of President Lincoln . " The shorter poem , " 0 Captain ! My Captain ! " has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its simplicity , direct ness , and note of personal grief appeal to all readers . The longer poem , " When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomed , " is one of the superlative literary productions of the nineteenth century . " A sonorous nocturne , " Swinburne called it , and this characterization accurately describes the tone-color and music of this great lyric expression . Whitman probably never reached a higher level than he achieved in this poem with the chant beginning " Come lovely and soothing death . " " Memories of President Lincoln " is a fitting tribute to a great American leader by the man who is generally considered as our greatest poet . Whitman 's Verse Form. ? It is useless to speculate upon the poetic qualities of Leaves of Grass . Some have even questioned Whitman 's claim to recognition as a poet on the grounds that he disregarded all the external characteristics of poetry , even disdaining meter , that basic requisite of verse . The most casual reader of Whitman can see that the poet did not mean to have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the rhythm is that of good prose and not that of poetry . The nearest literary parallel to the lines of Leaves of Grass is to be found in Elizabethy n prose , especially in that of the Bible . But there is a rhythm of nature that might easily have been the model for Whitman , and that is the rhythmical but irregular beat of the ocean waves . Whatever the model was , the poet captured a rhythm that is exceedingly effective and not easily imitated . In attempting to voice in poetry the aspirations of a new people , Whitman broke with the past in form as in content . He could no more have caught the spiritual significance of America in conventional verse than Shakespeare could have written Hamlet 's soliloquies in the form of villanelles . Every great poet has been something of an innovator , and Whitman was only a little more daring than most . His claim to poetic renown rests on a more secure basis than an adherence to or a defection from conventional rules . He is en  | titled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tude of his imagination and in the sustained majesty of his utterances . He was not always great , it is true , but neither was Shakespeare , neither was Wordsworth . Only a shortsighted critic would make final judgment of Wordsworth on some of the flat lyrics that grieve all sensitive readers , and it would be only a perversely wrongheaded critic who would insist upon discussing Whitman in terms of some of his screechy , flamboyant lines . " Leaves of Grass . " ? Beginning in 1855 Whitman published all his poetry in successive editions of Leaves of Grass . About twelve editions came out during the poet 's lifetime , and many more have been published since 1892 . The best edition for the beginning student of Whitman is that so admirably edited and abridged by Professor Emory Holloway . This collection of about too poems contains the full flavor of Whitman with judicious omissions of the debatable passages . In addition to Leaves of Grass Whitman left a considerable amount of prose . Perhaps the most valuable single bit is the preface to the 1855 edition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . As such it is one of the significant prefaces in the history of literature . Another important piece is Democratic Vistas , a statement of his faith in democracy in those dark days following the Civil War , when it seemed that the worst features of American life were permanently in control of our national destiny . In some passages this little pamphlet is not effective , but in others it has an imaginative grasp and a grandeur of utterance equaled only by his best poetry . Whitman 's Influence. ? Every great artist has a tendency to ruin his particular vehicle as a mode of expression for his immediate successors . The grand style of Michael Angelo , so triumphantly achieved , led his successors into the fatal mistake of confusing grandeur and mere size . As a result , the first few years after the death of the old master saw canvases acres in extent but totally lacking in merit . All dramas in blank verse since the Elizabethan period have been inevitably compared with Shakespeare 's to the vast discomfiture of the later dramatists , Following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the master 's until the rise of Brahms . To this day German opera is under the huge shadow of Wagner . So it is in American poetry . Many have imitated Whitman , but few have been successful . However , this statement does not mean that Whitman has had  | no influence in American literature . It is true that such poets as Carl Sandburg , Edgar Lee Masters , and many another have written in verse as free as anything in Leaves of Grass , but the younger men have used free forms that are their own individual possessions . There have been and still are many close imitators of Whitman , but they are not among our leading poets . They are destined to go down in literature as imitators . On the other hand those poets who are most successful have gone far along the path first traveled by Whitman . In the content of recent literature Whitman has been as influential as he has been in the form . The poet 's study is no longer a thing of four walls and rows of books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city , the factory , the farm , and the small town . Bookishness is no longer the rule of our poetry . Furthermore the themes of our literature are to-day drawn from that vast field indicated by the wide gesture of Whitman . Our novelists and our dramatists have quit copying Dickens , Thackeray , Victor Hugo , and the pallid imitations of Shakespearean poetic dramas . Dreiser , Sinclair Lewis , Sherwood Anderson , Eugene O'Neill , and Willa Cather reflect various phases of their America just as Whitman hoped his successors would do . Poets to come ! orators , singers , musicians to come ! Not today is to justify me and answer what I am for , But you , a new brood , athletic , continental , greater than before known , Arouse ! for you must justify me . The old poet has had his wish . His aims and achievements are justified in every book that falls into the main stream of our literature , and it is almost certain that the fullness of his justification is not yet reached . Emerson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe . Foreign literary fashions may give us many things in years to come ; they may once more dictate the subject matter and the methods of our authors , but in the works of our three great writers American literature has achieved a splendid independence and a noble sonority of expression .

Indispensable .  | THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AMERICAN NOVEL TO 186c Of all the common literary forms the novel was the latest to develop . Centuries after many varieties of poetry were well known in England and almost two centuries after the drama reached its full development , Samuel Richardson wrote Pamela ( 1744 ) , generally known as the first English novel . The author followed his great success with Clarissa Harlowe and later with Sir Charles Grandison . Americans read and liked all these books , for Richardson was very anxious to leave a moral lesson with his readers . Indeed Pamela has for its sub-title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular in this country . Even so strict a moralist as Jonathan Edwards read it and approved so heartily of its style that he resolved to pay more attention to his own writing . One of the earliest of the great American religious revivalists , Charles G. Finney , was named by his mother for the morally perfect hero of Richardson 's last novel . However , Richardson 's great contemporaries , Henry Fielding , Tobias Smollett , and Laurence Sterne , were not so immediately popular in America . Certainly they were not widely accepted in New England , for almost every character and idea set forth by any of the three would have been anathema to the Puritans . These three novelists were realists , that is , they were concerned with setting down the various aspects of human nature , good , bad , and indifferent , with no regard whatever for the lesson imparted or the lack of one . These men were interested in action and in the external manifestations of character , while Richardson was interested in character analysis and in the presentation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realists , while the moralist dealt largely in sentiment . The . first American novel was The Power of Sympathy by Mrs. Sarah Wentworth Morton of Bosh . It is a poor thing written in the form of letters , as were the novels fo Richardson , and simply drowned in sentimental tears . To-day it lives only as a historical relic of a taste and form that have alike vanished . Another senti-  | mental novel was The Coquette in which Mrs. Hannah Foster told a touching story of the sad fate that befell a young woman who jilted a minister . This book was very popular , but it was far exceeded in general favor by Mrs. Susannah Rowson 's Charlotte , one of the greatest sellers in the history of American fiction . Indeed in length of days the popularity of this book surpasses that of any other native novel . There have been more than ioo editions published and of that huge number at least three are for sale by present-day publishers . Charlotte is also a tearful story of the misfortunes of a beautiful but injudicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other rewards that usually accompany that prize , the realists were beginning their work . The first of these was the genial satirist , Hugh Henry Brackenridge ; whose Modern Chivalry is a perfect mine of information about the early frontier democrats . Fielding was one of Brackenridge 's acknowledged masters . Certain critics have seen in our earliest satire enough of a likeness to the machinery of Cervantes to call Modern Chivalry the " Don Quixote of the frontier . " For many years the book retained its popularity , and nowhere was it more read than in the West . To-day it is to be had in a recent edition . Another realistic story was The Algerine Captive by Royall Tyler . This book follows the method of Defoe 's Robinson Crusoe in relating the story of a man who fell into the hands of pirates . Fact and fiction are cleverly woven together by Tyler as they were by his great master . Just at the close of the eighteenth century Charles Brockden Brown introduced to American fiction the whole romantic ferment with its discussion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the philosophical anarchism of Godwin . Joining these alien influences to native materials Brown became the first American novelist to win lasting critical approval coupled with a considerable amount of popularity . Within two or three decades after the . death of Brown , American romance had developed its three topics ? the settlement , the Revolution , and the frontier . At once the whole romantic school , Cooper , Kennedy , Bird , Simms , Paulding , Caruthers , and many a less renowned writer , flung themselves on the wealth of material at hand in a hasty attempt to satisfy the voracious appetite of American readers for sensational melodrama . The romantics started out well enough , but slowly the level of their performance dropped to meet  | the lower levels of public taste , and soon romance was in the hands of the bloodthirsty but futile hack-writers who turned out " Wild West " stories by the thousand . One man alone is said to have the credit ? or discredit ? for 600 titles . Obviously romance had committed suicide in pandering to a depraved taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent that the novel must receive a fresh impetus from another school of writers . Meanwhile sentiment was in as bad a way . In the days before the war the " weepful " school was dominated by the egregious Mrs. E. D. E. N. Southworth , Mrs. Mary J. Holmes , and Augusta Evans . The masterpiece of this group without doubt was St. Elmo , a perfect revel of saccharine delight written around a Byronic hero whose air of mystery and handsome appearance were the source of never-ending feminine sighs . But sentiment was no monopoly of women readers or writers . Donald Grant Mitchell with his Reveries of a Bachelor and George William Curtis with the weakly sentimental Prue and I showed that men could fall into the way of writing appeals to the tender emotions . By the time the war came on , sentiment had about reached the lowest level . Uncle Tom 's Cabin was too great a success not to have imitators . In fact Mrs. Stowe wrote one of these imitations in Dred , but it was reserved for T. S. Arthur to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the great anti-slavery appeal . This book was Ten Nights in a Bar Room , a melancholy record of the evils of drink . The author 's appeal to tears and maudlin sentiment was probably never surpassed in unconcealed effrontery , but despite the literary sins of the book it was long popular both as a novel and as a drama . In this last form it successfully competed for popular favor against a field that included such stand-bys as Uncle Tom 's Cabin and East Lynne . The fifties seems to have been our most sentimental decade . When the romantic appeal to imagination was made by any other than a master , it was very apt to be to weak sentimentality . Tears were the obsession of our sentimental romancers , and under the constant urge of such novelists American readers were losing their taste for homely literature that reflected the humor and the color of life . Literary realism was the cure for the disease , but the path of the realists was to be a hard and slow one to travel . Notwithstanding the shortcomings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of our greatest novelists , Hawthorne and Melville . It might be remarked  | in passing that the greater of the two , Melville , was almost totally rejected by his time . NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE ( 1804-1864 ) For long Hawthorne was considered the leading American novelist , but to-day the claims of other men are being urged with so great insistency that he is no longer permitted to occupy alone the highest pedestal of our fiction . The partisans of Mark Twain , Henry James , and Theodore Dreiser are urging that their favorites be considered at least the equal of Hawthorne , and there are very few critics of the younger generation who do not acclaim Moby Dick as the supreme achievement in American fiction . No one wishes to remove any laurels from Hawthorne 's brow . He would be considered a competent novelist in any country , and until our writers have made some immense advances he will continue to occupy a leading place in our literary history . However , it is not ungracious to point out a few of his shortcomings that are serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Thackeray , Hardy , and Conrad ? to name no more of the chief novelists of the English tongue . So serious and obvious are these defects that many can not consider him the equal of Mark Twain and Melville in his own land . The chief of these defects is a lack of human interest in the affairs of life , and especially in people . Hawthorne so often wrote in the allegorical strain that one always suspects him of using his characters as mere symbols of ideas . Of course symbolism is a recognized literary device , but its use by a novelist is very apt to lead the writer into a greater interest in the abstract idea than in the character . Certainly the creation of character is one of the main concerns of fiction , and the writers who stand highest are always those whose characters are the best conceived and presented . Moreover , despite the interest of Hawthorne in ideas , his intellectual range was neither wide nor deep . He was a taster of many a concoction , but never a one did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of so many conflicting ideas that ultimately the last became the antidote for its predecessor in the series . No intellectual interest ever grew into a transforming force in his life . He became a transcendentalist only to drop that engaging way of life when it yielded no immediate results . A moderate romantic individualist , he could  | still accept favors from an administration put into office by the slave power . So it was with all his ideas . They were superficial . The last count against the man is his lack of human warmth . This is implied in his inability to create character , but the defect becomes unconcealable when he starts his men and women on their round of experiences . The various episodes of his novels become as impersonal as scientific lectures . In the hands of a novelist like Dostoievsky or Tolstoy or even ? to drop to a lower level ? Dickens , The Scarlet Letter would have been one of the most poignant works in literature , as unforgettable as the sufferings of Lear . But in the hands of Hawthorne the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shades against a somber background . Warm , creative imagination , that soul-shaking force in literature , is simply not present . We close the book politely deploring the tragedy , but our emotions are not deeply stirred . Estimates of Hawthorne. ? A peculiar thing about the fame of Hawthorne is the curious inability of critics to agree on anything about the man except his competence as a novelist . Dr. Carl Van Doren calls him the " prime source " of information concerning the romantic era and says that his self-appointed task was to " sum up and body forth the inner vision of his age . " This estimate would imply that the novelist was a close observer and describer of the material and intellectual interests of contemporary life . On the other hand Mr. John Macy points out that Hawthorne was a born romancer in his distaste for his neighbor and his neighbor 's interests . The author of The Scarlet Letter alone , of all the literary men of his time , was not deeply stirred by black slavery or any of the burning issues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , declares Mr. Macy , from any sort of ethical tradition about or before him . Mr. John Erskine says that Hawthorne 's genius was formed in transcendentalism . Dr. and Mrs. C. A. Beard , in an appraisal of the novelist that contains some impressive statements from his own writings , classify Hawthorne as a truly democratic spirit in his acceptance of the people and in his mistrust of aristocracy , pointing out , however , that his disinclination to go the full distance in romantic idealism was shown by his early withdrawal from transcendentalism . The historians finally conclude that the man was temperamentally a skeptic . Mr. Parrington , starting at this point , goes further than the other critics in bringing out the inconsistencies of Hawthorne 's temper by showing that , although he was a member of Brook Farm and nomi-  | nally a romantic idealist , he had no belief in human perfectibility ; that he mistrusted man 's instincts , and that he was barred from participation in transcendentalism by his lack of mysticism . Certain recent biographers seem never to have heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be considered as the background of every American romantic writer . From these contradictory estimates one may justly conclude that it is high time for a new critical appraisal of Hawthorne . When such an estimate is made , it will probably be not far from the ground occupied jointly by the Beard and Parrington estimates , for these are not violently contradictory and they come nearer than any others to explaining the novelist 's point of view . One of the chief implications of the romantic movement was an attempt to abolish sin and evil . To such men as John Humphrey Noyes and Walt Whitman the attempt was an accomplished fact , and to virtually all the other romantics , especially those of New England , the immediate future held out the most rosy promise of success . Hawthorne was temperamentally incapable of accepting this promise . He was too intelligent not to be curious about the problem of evil , but his mental equipment was not sufficient to make him a deep student of the eternal problem . The whole urge of his age was to acquiesce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common sense acted as a constant brake on his romanticism . He sampled all theories and filled himself with none . As a result , his whole life was a constant testing of ideas in his clear but thin , cold intelligence . To none of these could he give his full allegiance or his whole-hearted opposition . The temperamental skeptic is capable of nothing but skepticism . There is probably a great deal of Hawthorne himself in " The Great Stone Face , " for the chief figure is a cautious skeptic to whom at last comes the reward that the unthinking had so often tried to bestow upon others . Incidentally it might be said that Daniel Webster was the original of old Stony Phiz . A statement that clearly shows the self-contradictory element in Hawthorne is the one that he made on commerce and trade : " Traffic seems to be an evil , but who knows but high moral results may flow from the most unattractive stream of human action ? " During the Civil War the novelist complained that a " man 's opinions can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some shrewish accusation  | of disloyalty . " The ability to throw himself wholly into any cause or idea was denied Hawthorne . Life of Hawthorne. ? Solitude was in the very blood of Nathaniel Hawthorne . When the boy 's father , a Salem sea captain , died while on a voyage to the tropics , the mother became a recluse , and the care of the four-year-old child was largely intrusted to the mother 's brothers , well-to-do men who did not stint their nephew 's educational opportunities . Hawthorne as a lad spent a considerable period of time in a quiet country home in Maine owned by one of his uncles . Here he read widely and gave himself over to his inclination for brooding meditation . In 1825 he was graduated from Bowdoin College in the class with Longfellow and Franklin Pierce . Pierce and Hawthorne remained lifelong friends . Upon his graduation , Hawthorne returned to his mother 's home in Salem , where for more than ten years he lived in almost unbroken solitude . He wished to make writing his life work , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to perfect his style . In 1839 he obtained a post in the Boston Custom House which he kept for a short time . In 1841-1842 he spent about a year at the transcendental communistic experiment , Brook Farm . This experience was rather distasteful , and ever after he looked with more than usual skepticism upon soaring theories of social betterment . In July , 1842 , Hawthorne was married to Sophia Peabody , and the young couple settled at the Old Manse , the old home of Dr. Ezra Ripley , orthodox minister of Concord . From 1846 to 1849 he held another governmental post in the Salem Custom House . Franklin Pierce became president in 1853 and appointed his old friend consul at Liverpool , one of the most lucrative positions at the disposal of the government . He held this position for four years and afterward traveled on the Continent . After 186o he lived in Concord , where he was on terms of friendship with all the literary circle and intimate with none . He died suddenly while on a trip to New Hampshire with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cemetery . Hawthorne 's Early Work. ? When he was only twenty-four Hawthorne published an immature novel called Fanshawe , which completely failed to attract popular or critical attention . It did one thing , however , in that it opened the way for some contributions to The Token , a Boston annual publication . The next book from his pen was a collection of short stories , Twice-Told Tales . This book was so successful that a second series appeared in 1842 , five years  | after the first publication . As the collection stands to-day it contains some of the best and most characteristic work of the author . Some of the favorite stories included are " The Minister 's Black Veil , " " The Gray Champion , " " The Gentle Boy , " " The May-Pole of Merry Mount , " and " The Ambitious Guest . " The next important book was Mosses from an Old Manse , another collection of short stories . Among the pieces in this book are " Young Goodman Brown , " " Rappaccini 's Daughter , " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Scarlet Letter . " ? The Scarlet Letter ( 185o ) is almost unanimously rated to-day as the best work of its author and one of the indubitable masterpieces of American literature . The novel owes its rating not to the fact that it employs a historical background , as some have said , for strictly speaking the book is not historical . Hawthorne uses all the freedom of an accomplished artist in the handling of the Puritan background , carefully suppressing everything except the deep shadows from which the grim tragedy naturally proceeds . In its presentation of the facts of Puritan life The Scarlet Letter is not to be compared with Whittier 's little book , Margaret Smith 's Journal . Hawthorne was interested only in creating a harmonious setting for his story . In his effort he succeeded and thus gave the book a firmer grip on fame than he could have done by the most carefully presented historical background . Almost any one with a bit of time and access to a good library can discover and write down the elementary facts of history . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of The Scarlet Letter . In its lowest terms The Scarlet Letter is a poetic treatment of sin and its consequences . Without doing violence to the author 's intent , one can say that the thesis of the book is " The wages of sin is death . " But the novel set out to prove nothing . As little argumentative as a Chopin noctur.ie , it as completely captures a mood , or rather a harmonious collection of moods , for each character is less a person than a disembodied human emotion . The moods created are those of remorse , sorrow , and despair . So completely are these feelings woven into the story that characters , action , and background blend into a delicate but enduring work of art . One of the most commendable characteristics of the book is its economy of effort . The story is reduced to its simplest elements , and those elements are presented in a series of tableaux that move along with deliberate haste to the appointed end . The narrative is not exactly  | consecutive , for each tableau corresponds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unquestioned tone-unity of the book is accomplished by the author 's skill in the selection of his material and in the composition of each scene . The unity of impression is as marked as it is in " The Fall of the House of Usher . " The Scarlet Letter ought not to be compared with a great novel which grasps as its material an immense segment of life . It should not be likened to Les 31iserables , Vanity Fair , The Return of the Native , Tess of the D'Urbervilles , or Lord Jim . Rather it should be classed with those books that set out to capture a mood , tragic or otherwise , and in a relatively short space create the atmosphere and set the figures that completely embody the desired effect . It belongs with such undoubted masterworks as its own author 's short stories , the tales of Poe , Melville 's Benito Cereno , Hardy 's Under the Greenwood Tree , Conrad 's Youth , Mrs. Wharton 's Ethan Frome , and Miss Cather 's Lost Lady . Never should the brevity of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively little to do with the merit of a work of art . Chopin 's short piano pieces are just as remarkable as are his sonatas . The class that The Scarlet Letter belongs to is a high one , and in that class the book is entitled to an eminent position . Hawthorne 's Later Work. ? The later work of Hawthorne is excellent , but it never once quite reaches the level of The Scarlet Letter . Probably the best of the later books is The House of Seven Gables , another novel invested with an artistically true and delicate background that affords a perfectly harmonious back-drop for the joyless drama that is enacted before it . It too is a poetic treatment of life in the shadows of an old house . It uses more major characters and more detail than The Scarlet Letter , but the story never quite attains the starkly classical perfection that the earlier novel reaches . Blithedale Romance is the most interesting of Hawthorne 's works to a reader who is concerned with the author 's point of view , for this book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In no other place is the author 's lack of sympathy with romantic idealism more clearly marked . In Zenobia the novelist has given a spiteful picture of Margaret Fuller , and in other characters he has rather belittled the aims and intelligence of the reformers . The book does not give a very good picture of Brook Farm , but it gives an excellent portrayal of Hawthorne 's mind . Henry James and William Dean Howells have given Blithedale Romance the highest praise . It is natural  | that these two critics would do so , for they were completely wedded to the realistic method , and this is the only novel by Hawthorne that is at all realistic . The Marble Faun is another exploitation of the question of evil , this time in an Italian setting . For some quite inexplicable reason numbers of teachers have preferred that their classes make the acquaintance of Hawthorne in this story . Certainly the novel is a good piece of work , especially in the treatment of the Italian background . Every critic remarks that it is a " handy guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glow that makes memorable The Scarlet Letter and The House of Seven Gables . When Hawthorne is appraised from the standpoint of his romantic environment , he must be called a skeptic , a constantly doubting observer of current idealisms . Because he went back to the problem of evil in his best novels he has been called a Puritan , as if Puritans were the only people ever to have an interest in sin and its consequences . Puritan he was not ; few of our writers have been less touched by the spirit of old New England . To Hawthorne the problem of evil was merely evocative of a mood . Once in hand , this problem was treated as a poetic theme and not as a text for moralizing . The novelist stood aside from Puritanism just as he stood aside from his own age. , When all is said Hawthorne was preeminently an artist , interested more in presentation than in argumentation , more concerned with tone-color than with intellectual interests . It is as an artist and not as a thinker that he must be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation . Nor has the passage of years dimmed the artistry of The Scarlet Letter . Fragile though it is , that book stands secure in its place in American literature . HERMAN MELVILLE ( 1819-1891 ) The reputation of Herman Melville has had the most curious vicissitudes . His first book achieved a considerable degree of popularity , but each succeeding work met with less and less favor until the writer was forced to abandon a literary career for the monotonous duties of an inspector of customs . Although Melville lived for forty years after the period of his relative popularity , he meant so little to the readers of the seventies and eighties that when he died in  | 1891 few people seemed to recognize the significance of his work . A history of American literature published in 1901 gives him one sentence . Another of about ten years later fails to mention him in the body of the work but allots him three lines in the appendix and gives the names of five of his works . The four-volume Cambridge History of American Literature ( 1918 ) gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his birth awakened a considerable interest in the man , and in 1921 came the first biography , an admirable work by Raymond Weaver . Since that time Melville has been the subject of innumerable articles and of at least two excellent biographical and critical studies . Furthermore we know that more books on the man are in the making . The last published work , Herman Melville , by Lewis Mumford , says that the novelist " shares with Walt Whitman the distinction of being the greatest imaginative writer that America has produced : his epic , Moby Dick , is one of the supreme monuments of the English language ; and in depth of expression and religious insight there is scarcely any one in the nineteenth century , with the exception of Dostoievsky , who can be placed beside him . " Thus in the short space of thirty years the reputation of Melville has risen from complete obscurity to an equality with that of the greatest writers of all time . In another evaluation Mr. Mumford places Moby Dick beside The Divine Comedy , Hamlet , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly is not easy to determine why Melville lost all his popularity there are discoverable reasons for the disfavor of the vast majority of American readers . In the first place the novelist so often and so bluntly stated his contempt for society and civilization that his offended public set him down as a misanthrope , a hater of mankind , and in this country no curse is so blastingly condemna , tory as the accusation that a man is not willing to hob-nob with the crowd and to slap backs with the most vulgar . A similar charge caused our historians for fifty years to regard Thoreau as merely " the queer man of a New England village . " In book after book Melville overlooked no chance to repudiate society and to excoriate the fruits of its most revered institutions . In his copy of Schopenhauer , the philosopher of pessimism , this sentence is underlined : " When two or three are gathered together , the devil is among them . " Such was the feeling of Melville , and from the touch of man he shrank aghast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick as Ishmael , the outcast , the wanderer , and when men flee from society , they  | are very apt to create for themselves a dream-land from which all the plagues of earthly life will be banished . Thus did Jean Jacques Rousseau , Edgar Allan Poe , and James Branch Cabell , to name no more . Melville , too , had his own Utopia , his land of forgetfulness , but , unlike Mr. Cabell , he made the fatal mistake of visiting this land in person . The South Seas were Melville 's Utopia , but a stay of four months in the tropic vale of Typee created in the visitor only an insuperable desire to escape . Thereafter all Utopias were subjected to Melville 's skeptical criticism . Society simply would not do , and there was no escaping the company of man . In the next place Melville , like Hawthorne , was burdened with the problem of evil , its origin , its meaning , and its final destiny . Especially prominent was this question in the greatest of his books , Moby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil in the dim shadows of the past , Melville insisted upon talking about the question in terms of contemporary civilization , and more than a few times his hot satire seared some object of unquestioned respectability . Such a novelist is bound to be uncomfortable , and if there is anything that the American of the fifties wanted to find in his literature it was comfort . Sentimental readers can snivel agreeably over the misfortunes of a wayward youth or maiden , but such people can get no pleasure out of a realistic analysis of comforting hypocrisies . Hawthorne 's romanticism kept him from offending most readers ; Melville 's realism repelled many . Finally , Melville was declared to be obscure . It is true that such a charge can not be successfully denied in the case of Mardi and Pierre , and the full meaning of Moby Dick is not exactly crystalclear , but the meaning of Typee , Onaoo , Red burn , and White Jacket is not debatable . Four more lucid and straightforward works are not to be found . But the charge of obscurity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of German philosophy . The charge was damaging , for Kant and Hegel were not so attractive to the general reader in 1855 as they were to Emerson and Parker in the first flush of discovery many years earlier . While the reasons here given might not have been potent enough to account for all of Melville 's lack of popularity , they would account for at least some of it . Life of Melville. ? Herman Melville was born in New York City . Both his mother and his father belonged to old and rather distinguished families . His mother was a Gansevoort , one of the Dutch  | families long prominent in the life of the city . In 1832 the father died , leaving the mother burdened by the care of a large family of small children . Herman received no college training whatever , and the cold , hampered environment in which he grew up was hardly a desirable training school for a genius . A good deal of his early life can be glimpsed in the first chapters of Redburn . This book , the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Melville 's first voyage , a round-trip from New York to Liverpool in 1837 . So far as one can ascertain to-day there is a very slight fictitious element in this account , though one does have difficulty in telling whether all the bitterness in the heart of Wellingborough Redburn was really in the heart of the young Melville , or whether it was placed there by the author of 1849 who had then suffered many embittering experiences and disappointments . After returning from his first voyage Melville engaged in a variety of occupations until early in 1841 , when he shipped as a sailor from New Bedford , Massachusetts , on the whaler " Acushnet , " immortalized as the " Pequod " of Moby Dick . In about four years the whaler returned with her holds filled with oil , but Melville was not in the crew . After serving on the ship for about eighteen months he and a young companion , Toby Greene , deserted at the Marquesas Islands , an archipelago in the south Pacific . Five days of hardship and thrilling adventure followed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley of Typee . The whole story is given in Typee and there is hardly a reader who will not thank the one who sends him to that delightful source for his information . The inhabitants were savages ? cannibals , Melville feared ? but their manners were kind , and they inhabited a veritable paradise . Toby soon escaped , and after Melville had been held for four months " in an indulgent captivity " he too managed to get away . An Australian whaler rescued Melville , but service on this ship was too distasteful to be endured , and he left the vessel at Tahiti . In company with a ship 's doctor , Long Ghost , he had some interesting adventures on this island , adventures which are vividly related in Omoo , another book that seems destined for immortality . After knocking about the Pacific for some time , Melville finally started for home on board a United States war vessel , arriving in Boston in October , 1844 . The story of this trip is told in White Jacket . Upon reaching home Melville wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began in 1846 with Typee ; Omoo followed a year later . In 1849 came two books , Redburn and Mardi , with White Jacket appearing the following year . By this time Melville was married , and the question of a steady income was becoming increasingly important . All these books had had a certain sale , but none had reached enough popularity that the author could call himself a success . In 1850 he bought a farm in the Berkshire Hills of western Massachusetts , and here he settled down to the task of writing Moby Dick . In the Berkshires the novelist had Hawthorne for a near neighbor , and between the two men there developed a close friendship , one of the most intimate that either ever enjoyed . It is a question whether the writers influenced each other . Certainly they had relatively little in common save a deep pessimism , much more pronounced in Melville , and a desire to probe the question of evil . In the congenial neighborhood of another writer , Moby Dick was completed and published in 1851 with a dedication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sell very well . In 1852 came Pierre , a work that some critics have called a " desperate book . " Certainly it was most confusing , and its unpopularity was assured from the start . Thereafter Melville wrote less , and with the exception of Israel Potter and The Piazza Tales , a collection of short stories , his books could not be expected to appeal to a general audience . The necessity of making a living led Melville in 1867 to take a position in the New York Custom House . In 1886 , when Mrs. Melville inherited enough money to give the two a competence in their old age , the novelist resigned his position and essayed a little writing . Billy Budd , the one interesting result of this period , was not published until many years after the author 's death . The long-forgotten novelist and traveler of the South Seas died in 1891 . " Typee " and " Omoo . " ? Melville discovered the South Seas for literature . The discoverer has been followed to those delectable isles by Robert Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brooke ? a goodly company ? to say nothing of the dozens of less distinguished writers who have given us more or less truthful narratives of life in the southern Pacific , but of all the books produced about.the South Seas , it is gravely to be doubted if any exceed the first two in literary merit . Of these two Typee is probably more widely admired than is Omoo . The earlier book has a freshness of presentation and a sparkle of genius about it that the latter does not always possess , though the portrait of Dr. Long Ghost in Omoo is one  | of Melville 's triumphs . But Typee has many triumphs . It spread before the ravished gaze of the culture-sick European the sundrenched greenery of an Eden uncursed by culture and its penalties , unmarred by the blight of civilization . Fayaway is an imperishable figure ; in her the primitive beauty of a long-vanished past and the transient youth of all mankind are made eternal . " She was neither a mystery nor a sin , " but a goddess of classical antiquity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objective beauty and color of the world and left brooding sorrows and vain misgivings as the melancholy birthright of a less joyous time . Then , too , the episodes of Typee are related with a vividness and dramatic skill that give each one as sharp an outline as if it were the personal experience of each reader . The curious thing about the two books is the fact that they represent the recollections of a young man of twenty-six , and yet they have in them the acrid reflections that usually follow a spent youth and the disillusions of middle or old age . Nor do these books reflect the indefinite and indefinable green-sickness of youth . Each contains numerous and specific indictments of civilization , and every indictment is fortified by concrete evidence of objective evils that are traced to the influence of society . The point of view is that of a scientific but hostile critic , not that engendered of a romantic melancholy , vaguely objecting to things present and known . The prospect of life in the valley of Typee was so attractive that it raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that went down precipitously when the writer again reached so-called civilized men . Whence came this bitterness , this black rage against civilization ? Did Melville carry it into Typee , or did the unspoiled life in the tropical valley first make him realize the festering sores of civilization ? In the answer to that question lies one of the keys to the riddle of Herman Melville . There is one more question that perplexes : why did Melville leave his island paradise ? It is true that over him constantly hovered the dread of being eaten by his hosts , who , he suspected , were cannibals . Did this fear drive him from the island ? The answer is highly uncertain . Melville 's fear could have been removed completely and permanently by his submitting to the process of tattooing , an act that would have made him a blood-brother of the tribe . But tattooing was the thing that he constantly refused , and in his refusal he rejected the happiness of Typee . After all , perhaps happiness  | was not for Melville . He had tasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sweet springs of Typee could bring forgetfulness . All his life he was tortured by his recollections , hopes , and aspirations ; never could he find peace . Hawthorne once said that Melville would gain no rest until he could get hold of some definite belief . " He can neither believe nor be comfortable in his unbelief , and he is too honest and courageous not to try to be one or the other . " This is one of the best criticisms of Melville ever uttered , and liberally interpreted it explains many things in the man 's life . It can be made to explain his departure from Typee and his subsequent idealization of life among the savages . " Redburn " and " White Jacket . " ? Redburn and White Jacket are among the best sea stories in our language . They are too factual to be compared with Conrad 's poetic interpretations of the sea , and far too good to be likened to the ordinary travel books . They belong in the class with such works as Dana 's Two Years Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and writer of the sea , declares that he likes Redburn best of all the books by Melville . Certainly the description of the ship and her motley crew , the events of the voyage , the unforgettable misery that Melville saw in the slums of Liverpool , and the sinister figure of Jackson , one of the ship 's company , are all set forth with a literary skill that makes the reader a participant in the experiences described . In White Jacket the outstanding achievement of the writer is the creation of Jack Chase , one of the most admirable figures that has ever entered any book of the sea . Incidentally White Jacket presents so vivid an indictment of the evils of flogging in the navy that copies of the book were given to every member of Congress when the abolition of that evil was under consideration . " Mardi " and " Pierre . " ? Mardi and Pierre are alike in that they are both fantastic extravaganzas that many critics have pronounced hopelessly incomprehensible . To-day one has difficulty going the full length with these critics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mardi starts out like an ordinary romance of the South Seas . There is an escape from a whaler , the meeting with an apparently deserted brigantine , and a shipwreck , but in the second half of the book the atmosphere of reality changes to one of complete fancy . From then on the story becomes a chaotic allegory of life with the pursuit of the maiden Yillah by the hero of the book representing  | the fruitless quest of man for beauty . All the kingdoms of the world and all the still more extensive kingdoms of philosophy become parts of Melville 's satirical allegory . The machinery of the book is simply the search for happiness by mankind , eternally disillusioned , eternally hopeful . Mardi is not totally incomprehensible , but understanding the book is no child 's play . Pierre Is probably the wildest , bitterest book ever produced on this Continent . It was the last of the author 's great works in point of composition and to it he brought his full powers , but when he sat down to write , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his very life blood into Moby Dick to no purpose . Into Pierre went all the pent-up anger of an outraged soul . It is Melville 's " spiritual autobiography , " worthy of comparison with the confessions of Rousseau or St. Augustine . When the author looked at life , especially when he considered how his own days had been spent , his heart was black within him , and out of this blackness came Pierre . Naturally his own generation would have none of it , and for seventy years ( until 1929 ) it was very hard to find a copy of this novel . " Moby Dick . " ? On the surface Moby Dick is a book of the whale . Everything that is known of the leviathan is here written down , his anatomy , his habits , his different varieties , his economic importance , and especially his capture and transformation into whale oil . 1851 was a good time to tell the story of the whale . Nantucket and New Bedford ships were nosing into every corner of the seven seas in search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boatmen was a magnet to attract thousands of New England boys away from the safe but monotonous hill farms . And wealth waited the successful whaler , for did not Nantucket have a Pacific Bank , whose capital stock came out of the western ocean ? Whaling was the romantic occupation that gold-mining was shortly , that railroad building and air-plane flying later became . The plain story of Moby Dick is simple . The narrator , Ishmael , leaves Nantucket on the whaler " Pequod . " The vessel is commanded by Captain Ahab , who has lost a leg in a combat with a huge white whale . The whale escaped , and the brooding over his misfortune and the deep thirst for revenge made Ahab a monomaniac . His one overpowering desire is to kill the white whale , and the story is that of an eager , relentless search for Moby Dick by a crazed captain at the head of a wild crew . Thus far the book is simplicity itself , for  | despite its length , the meaning of the informative passages and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain facts and the simple narrative are not all of Moby Dick , though one may read the book with much pleasure and profit and see nothing else there . The acute reader does not go far before he begins to sense that there is more to the story than the mere words indicate . Symbolism makes an unmistakable appearance ; certain episodes seem to be allegorical . The beginning reader need not be worried by such things . Any one will be reasonably safe in considering that Moby Dick stands for evil , the ocean for life , and Captain Ahab for the unconquerable soul of man . The long search for Moby Dick , the combat , and the ultimate catastrophe are the allegorical representation of the spirit of man grappling with the vast problem of evil . Melville says : " That unsounded ocean you gasp in is Life . " Once more : " The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating at them . " An exact analysis of the symbolical meaning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to his own statement , with no clear grasp of the allegory . Some have interpreted the whale as the universe ; some have seen in Ahab the very image of Melville . With these interpreters there is no quarrel ; their reading of the story does not differ materially enough from the one given to allow a very clearly distinguished difference of opinion . It is probable that the chief figures may have meant one thing to Melville to-day and quite another to-morrow , for he said : " What the White Whale was to them , or how to their unconscious understandings , also , in some dim , unsuspected way , he might have seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life ? all this to explain would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go . " The meaning of Moby Dick is no clearer than is the ultimate meaning of Hamlet . Moby Dick is a book of many inconsistencies and contradictions . Certain passages are very clear , others are not ; sometimes the action is swift and dramatic , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but irrelevant information . Notwithstanding the lapses of the narrative , Moby Dick has more compelling power than any other book has in the whole field of American literature , and one must go to the heights of English drama and Russian fiction to find its equal . Few sensitive readers can scramble to the deck of the " Pequod " and there meet the monomaniac captain without becom-  | ing a passenger on that strange voyage that does not end until ship . captain , and crew are buried in the " great shroud of the sea . " Whatever Moby Dick may mean to various people , a sea voyage , a treatise on whales , or a study of abnormal psychology , it will have its wisest reading as a symphony or huge epic of the sea . The book must be read for one to see how effectively the author captured the mood of the ocean and with what power he transferred that mood to paper . For sheer artistry there are unsurpassed chapters in Moby Dick . The style of the prose is admirably fitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prose ; it is poetry . Pages and pages of the story have the majesty and power of great verse , and at times the characters talk in a language that has never been equaled for force and rhythmical beauty since the days of Shakespeare . Moby Dick is more than a book ? it is an experience , just about the greatest experience that recent literature can offer . Talking about it is futile , it must be read to be appreciated . The Minor Works. ? This inadequate discussion leaves untouched a number of Melville 's minor works . The chief of these are Benito Cereno and Israel Potter . Benito Cereno is a story of an adventure encountered by an American sea captain off the coast of South America . The framework of the narrative was taken almost verbatim from official records , but Melville touched the cold , lifeless facts of a captain 's reports with the genius of a born story-teller , and the result is a perfect evocation of atmosphere . Over every word of the narrative hangs a nameless dread , a feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as does " The Fall of the House of Usher , " but Poe could never get the reality into his lines that Melville achieved so deftly . Israel Potter is a good historical novel with John Paul Jones and Franklin among the characters . It deserves more readers than it has ever had . The story of the romantic revolution is at an end . At the close of the Civil War the Golden Day was ready to plunge into the gray and undistinguished twilight . Walt Whitman alone of the romantic writers was still producing , and he was but amplifying a chant that he had first raised ten years earlier . Industrialism had triumphed ; war had only emphasized the completeness of the victory of expediency and material interests over romantic idealism . A vague romanticism lingered on through the twilight in the shape of  | the feeble enthusiasm of the Genteel Tradition . Poetry was in the hands of the imitators of Lowell and Longfellow . Fiction was in the hands of the local colorists . Even though the romantic revolution was lost in the murky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great work in America . An intellectual movement that gave birth to every first-rate novel , poem , and story written in America from 182o to 186o can not be dismissed as a futile , Quixotic charge against the whirling mills of materialism . Even if romanticism had produced nothing more than the Journals of Emerson , Walden , Leaves of Grass , and Moby Dick , the revolution would have been considered a notable fact in any modern literature .

Americans have never been loath to accept wealth , and usually they have been quite willing to work hard to get it , for our people have always been dominated by middle-class ideas , not the least of which is the urge to " get on in the world . " In the beginning this continent was settled by men who were seeking to better their economic status . In the eighteenth century Benjamin Franklin spent a great deal of his time in pointing out the way of success to his eager disciples , and the westward rolling line of settlement was forwarded by land hunger , more than by any other motive . The factory system was started in this country by those who wished to produce revenue from large-scale industry , and one of the chief concerns of Alexander Hamilton and Daniel Webster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing interests . Certainly we have never been despisers of wealth , but money-getting activities never reached so great proportions or degenerated into so frenzied a scramble as they achieved in the twenty-five years following the Civil War . From 1800 to 1865 industry was beset by two vigorous rivals . In the first place business enterprise was confined very largely to the northeastern seaboard . It was highly sectional . As such it was opposed by the small farmers of the Middle West and fought furiously and determinedly by the planters of the South . In the hands of the last class was vast political power , and every ounce of that power was hurled against the manufacturing interests of the northeast . This would have made the way of industry hard enough , but  | in addition the implications of commercialism were opposed by the romantic spirit that was reaching so vigorous an expression in New England . The southern planters fought industry in the political arena , while romanticism used every effort to discredit it by an appeal to the individual longings and spiritual desires that were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests , if these interests were much extended . But despite these handicaps industrialism won . " Things are in the saddle , " was the melancholy observation of Emerson that seemed to prophesy evil to romanticism . Prophecy or observation or both , it was amply confirmed . Industrialism could not be checked ; it was destined to control the country , despite the efforts of agriculture and the moral opposition of romanticism . In the struggle romanticism was killed , and there are those who say that agriculture was wounded unto death . I Romanticism was ended by science , technology , invention , in short , by the industrial revolution and the subsequent development of manufacturing and its allied interests , commerce and finance . Industry stood for monetary profit , material progress , and the rule of common sense and expediency ; romanticism stood for high idealism and the life of the spirit.l Since 186o the businessman has been without a serious rival as the dominant figure in American life . Conditions After the Civil War. ? The Civil War marked the achievement of a double revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the philosophy of industrialism over the philosophy of romanticism , and it gave unmistakable notice to the world that the political power of the southern planters was at an end . As a matter of fact both aspects of the revolution had been consummated before the first gun was fired at Fort Sumter . While no one can be very definite in dealing with so intangible a thing as the spiritual and intellectual life of a people , one is fairly safe in asserting that the romantic movement was showing signs of a sharp decline by 186o . The thirties and forties were the heyday of romanticism , but by the middle of the next decade most of the familiar aspects of the great movement were noticeably waning . Certainly by 1865 the chief tenets of romanticism were as old-fashioned as the laws of Hammurabi , and it is very doubtful if so complete a downfall could have been accomplished in so short a time as the duration of the war if the romantic movement had not been on the decline before 1861 . The other aspect of the revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also virtually effected before 186o . At least the South had lost the war long before the outbreak of hostilities . It had lost it to the wealth , industry , and population of the North , although it required the force of arms and four years of time to demonstrate to the Southerners that an agricultural society can not dominate more than twice its population sustained by vastly superior wealth and industry . The Civil War was won in the factories and money markets of the North , and those institutions had been developing rapidly for more than half a century . From the southern point of view the outcome of the war was as calamitous as possible . Southern agriculture was prostrate , the land was fallow , the horses and mules were among the casualties of the battle field , the buildings were burned or in dilapidation , and the field workers , worth from three to five billion dollars before the war , were freed from any obligation to till the crops . Furthermore the business life of the South had simply disappeared . Confederate paper money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the state governments were forced to repudiate their bonds . Worst of all from the southern standpoint , national political leadership had passed from the hands of the landed aristocrats to the hands of the " mudsills of society , " the mechanics of the North . In only one respect was the southern estimate mistaken ; political power had passed from the South , but into the hands of the industrialists and farmers of the North and West . In the strange political partnership thus created the real power was wielded by the manufacturing and commercial interests , though a western president usually was in the White House . One of the largest concessions made to the western farmer by the partnership was the passage of the Homestead Act in 1862 , a law that the southern planters and the commercial interests had formerly opposed with equal vigor . But the war had taken the Southerners out of political life , and the industrialists were so situated that it was necessary to placate their political partners . Out of the legislation passed during the progress of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These aims were embodied in laws that provided for a high tariff , for a system of national banks , and for generous grants for the construction of a transcontinental railroad . The first two of these measures had been vigorously opposed by the western farmers and by the southern planters , while the Southerners had looked dubiously upon a proposal to finance a railroad to the Pacific until the sug-  | gestion was made that Memphis or New Orleans be made the eastern terminus . While the war was in progress , the passage of all these acts was easy . The western farmers , elated over the Homestead Act , were in a mood to acquiesce in the suggestions of their benefactors The Nationalizing Effect of Industry. ? The effect of the three measures passed by the industrialists was to nationalize and consolidate the country more firmly than ever before . In the days before the war all the forces that opposed the spread of industrialism made for diversity and disunity ; they tended to develop local and sectional characteristics rather than the growth of national feeling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local government , and the western farmers were as thoroughly committed to the principles of personal independence and self-direction through their own local governmental agencies . The whole implication of romanticism was individual development and government without the intervention of a strongly centralized state . These were formidable forces of opposition , and they effectively checked for many decades the growth of a strong nationalism . But under cover of the war cloud the industrialists passed the measures that helped insure the steady and permanent nationalization of the country . The process of nationalization in the abstract was probably the last thing that the industrialists thought of ; they were interested in gaining and consolidating a rich market for their wares . The tariff law built a wall of protection around the nation that effectively prevented the entry to our home markets of competitive foreign goods . This law simply meant that the American manufacturer would be allowed to treat this nation as his own private domain , and whatever market he could find or create here would be his without interference . The national bank law stabilized the money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transaction of business . This act made a large and very important group of banks independent of state control and placed them under national supervision . Hitherto each state had passed its own banking laws , and while the national bank act did not supersede all these laws , it allowed the formation of banking houses all over the country under one jurisdiction . The building of a transcontinental railroad bound the country more closely together physically , and guaranteed the manufacturers a swift and inexpensive way of distributing their goods to markets that had hitherto been almost inaccessible . It is often said  | that the nationalization of our country was effected by the Civil War . Such a statement needs a bit of qualification ; the most powerful nationalizing forces loosed in this country as the result of the war were three acts that were passed without direct reference to the struggle that was being decided on the field of battle . Industry looked with no favor upon the Homestead Act , but when the manufacturers found that immigrants would replace the workers drawn west by the attraction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill . Accordingly for fifty years after the passage of the act and for twenty-five years after the virtual disappearance of the free land , our lenient immigration laws were a constant invitation to foreigners . During that time millions of aliens came to our I shores , many of whom found employment in the shops and mills of American industry . The greatest favor that industry gained from the Civil War was the passage of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution that in one provision forbids a state to deprive any person of property without " due process of law . " Since an incorporated business is legally a person , the importance of this amendment is immense . It is probably safe to say that more important cases originate under " due process of law " clause than under any other two or three sections of the Constitution . The Reign of Business. ? The imagination is staggered by a recital of the cold facts that show with what energy and avidity the business interests of the United States availed themselves of their self-made opportunities to pile up huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products in this country increased from less than two billion dollars to more than nine billion , and with the improved methods of manufacturing there is no very good reason for not thinking that the increase in profit was greater than the increase in production . Figures showing the amount of governmental aid given the Union Pacific Railroad will give some idea of the official attitude toward all private business enterprise . i It has been estimated that the corporation that built the line from Omaha to Ogden , Utah , received from the government 12,800 acres of land for every mile of road completed and a cash subsidy that varied from $16,000 to $48 , Ooo for each mile . ' With so great a sum of money being thrown about recklessly it is no wonder that soon every one was frantic with the acquisitive fever . The building of railroads was not the only way by which men  | made quick and easy money from 1865 to 189o , though the construction of almost every other important line during that period saw a repetition of the methods used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grants were not so lavishly bestowed . The western railroads opened up the richest body of timber in the world for exploitation by lumbermen . Untold riches in oil , coal , and other minerals lay in the earth waiting for the driller or miner , and other fortunes were ready for the men who would prepare for the market the droves of livestock that soon were to replace the slaughtered buffalo on the western plains . Soon every industry had its million aires , and there were few that did not boast their plutocrats , men whose wealth ran into fabulous figures . The Gilded Age saw the rise of such men as Gould , Harriman , Hill , Rockefeller , Morgan , W. A. Clark , Philip Armour , and a thousand others who varied from their prototypes only in the possession of a lesser amount of money . From 1865 to 1890 the first steps were taken toward the complete industrialization of the United States . The making of great fortunes became the primary aim of our people , and there was no very effective social philosophy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was to have no immediate successor . Manufacturing , transportation , and financial enterprises were being conducted on large scales , and profits accrued that were worthy of the scale of the undertakings . The social , intellectual , and spiritual results of this widespread industrialization were enormous . Modern America is the product of the Gilded Age , not the product of the earlier romantic period . The heritage of the Gilded Age can be seen in the problems of our huge cities , in our labor questions , in the dilemma of the farmers , and especially in the workaday psychology and philosophy of the American people . The Problem of Labor. ? Industry can not flourish in a rural population , and a rural population can not thrive where industry is dominant . Manufacturing and commerce are irresistible magnets drawing people to large centers , and one of the first results of the industrial wave was the beginning of the shift from the rural districts to the cities . The growth of the cities meant the outbreak of acute social questions . Housing , public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all became pressing problems during the Gilded Age , but the question that created the greatest amount of ominous comment and conjecture was that of labor . Such a problem could not have arisen in a rural society like that envisioned  | by the southern planters or by the romantics of New England . It took industrial America to bring it to life . In the old days of home manufacturing labor questions were impossible . Every man was his own employer . He set his own hours of labor , bought his own raw materials , and sold his product in the best possible market . But the advent of factories changed all this . The factory system meant the aggregation of capital in quantities far beyond reach of the average individual . It meant the hiring of laborers in large numbers who worked at highly specialized tasks with the aid of machinery . Whereas it was once hard to learn a trade like shoemaking , it became easy to work in a shoe factory , for a man or woman could quickly become reasonably proficient in the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laborer . He was no longer his own master . Frequently he no longer lived in his own house , but occupied one that was exactly like rows of others , all belonging to the company . The worker was no longer a self-controlled individual ; he was a unit of industry . The object of the employer was to work his men the longest possible time for the smallest possible wage . Similarly the object of the laborer was to demand shorter hours with no appreciable loss of pay . Capital and labor were squaring away for a mighty struggle . Organization of Labor. ? Although labor unions have existed in the United States since 1825 , the labor question did not become acute until after the Civil War . Before the great struggle and the beginning of the vast industrial boom , the unions had been weak and rather purposeless organizations , but after the war there was a rapid accumulation of dissatisfaction and a swift effort to unite all workers in one union . The result was the National Labor Union , founded in 1866 , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general it suffered from a lack of concrete aims , and though it took a stand for the eight-hour day , for the establishment of a national bureau of labor , and for the exclusion of Chinese , it could never decide whether it wished to accept the privately owned system of industry or whether it was in favor of factories owned by the state or the workers . After a chaotic existence this organization came to an end in 1872 . The National Labor Union was succeeded by the Knights of Labor , an organization that admitted to membership any one except professional gamblers , saloon keepers , lawyers , and bankers . This group had rather more definite aims than did its predecessor , but it too suffered from grandiose schemes for the reorganization of society , and it  | had quite a bit of the economic radicalism of the romantic period . It played with all kinds of ideas from almost every source . Western agrarianism , socialism , and various other theories found their way into meetings of the Knights of Labor . All this aroused opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to place all laborers , skilled and unskilled , in one group . For more than a decade this was the only labor organization in this country , but in 1883 a group of practical men formed the American Federation of Labor . This new group made no attempt to become one big union of all laborers , but started with the idea of federating trade unions in one inclusive organization . Thus a man did not belong to the American Federation directly but held his membership there through his affiliation with a trade union . Such a plan of organization eliminated some of the weaknesses of the earlier attempts . The hangerson and well-wishers of labor found no place in the new group . The membership was solidly from the laboring class , and an overwhelming percentage was from the skilled trades . These facts gave a unity of ideas and aims to the Federation that the earlier " one big unions " had not possessed . From the beginning the Federation was rather conservative . It naturally supported such demands of labor as the eight-hour day , high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to have anything to do with the socialistic movement that was beginning to assume some little importance , and moreover it declined to form a new political party with the laboring class as its basis . Samuel Gompers and the other men who formed the Federation accepted the present capitalistic system of industry , that is , private ownership by the capitalist-employers . This acceptance of capitalism somewhat reassured the moneyed class , which had looked with great alarm upon the radical tendencies of the National Labor Union and the Knights of Labor . However conservative the American Federation may have been in its acceptance of the capitalistic system and in its refusal to form a new political party , the organization exerted a great influence for liberalism in our state and national politics . Among other things it stood for a graduated income tax , generously supported education for all children , direct election of United States senators , control of legislation by the voters through the initiative , referendum , and the recall , and various other proposals that were advanced from time to  | time . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the platforms of both major political parties , for the Federation held steadily to the policy of rewarding its friends and punishing its enemies irrespective of party . The Great Strikes of the Gilded Age. ? The oft-repeated prophecy of the southern planters that the North would ultimately see a civil war between capital and labor seemed to be promised a speedy fulfillment during the Gilded Age . Before the smoke of battle cleared , industrial trouble broke out in various parts of the North , the most serious being bitter and expensive strikes by the shoemakers in a number of industrial centers . But it was not until after 1873 that strikes became a serious national question . The panic of 1873 was responsible for a widespread financial distress and a consequent lack of employment by laborers . Millions of people were in the grip of grinding poverty , and thousands of unemployed walked the streets of our cities seeking desperately for work . At the height of the industrial depression came two strikes of national importance , one among the textile workers of New England , the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs , and both ended in defeat for the strikers , but these affairs were only skirmishes in the great struggle that was brewing . In 1877 some of the eastern railroads announced wage cuts of ten per cent . At once virtually all the railroads east of the Mississippi and north of the Ohio were paralyzed by the walkout of their workers . Attempts to run the roads with the aid of strike-breakers met with determined opposition . In several cities the militia , reenforced by troops of the regular army , were summoned to preserve order . The results were numerous bloody clashes between the soldiers and the strikers ; property to the value of millions of dollars was burned ; dozens of lives were lost ; and hundreds were wounded in the pitched battles fought in the streets of various cities . Over large portions of the country it seemed that law and order were at an end . The most serious situations arose in Baltimore , Pittsburgh , and Buffalo , but rioting occurred in Chicago and St. Louis and as far away as San Francisco . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to run their trains under the protection of the military . The tragic affair ended in total defeat for the workers , but the immediate results of tragedy , property loss , and social disaster were far exceeded by the lamentable after-effects . The strike brought an atmosphere of suspicion and hate into our indus-  | trial life that was not lost for at least a generation . The whole affair came very near breaking out into class war , the dread event long foretold by Southerners , and peace , when it finally came , was not peace , but a suspension of hostilities . The fire of class antagonism smoldered on , ready to break into flames at a moment 's notice . Never did the whole social structure of the country seem so near to disaster as it did in the seventies , and the most ominous threat came from the relations of capital and labor . Industrialism had already proved one thing : it had demonstrated that the shift of our population from an agricultural basis to an industrial and financial basis means the loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitution of collective thought and action . The whole tendency of events after the Civil War was to organize our society into classes . Labor unions and federations , strikes , the great combinations of capital , and the very processes of industry all assisted in the growth of class consciousness . Gone was the old independence , the feeling of self-sufficiency , the buoyant faith that all would end well . The employer became a unit in a complex organization , and the laborer became a unit of energy in the factory . Both faced certain facts that could not be romanticized into something pleasant . The unpleasantness of inescapable facts and the substitution of collective thought and action for individualism were sure to have great effects in our national literature . CHANGES IN AGRICULTURE DURING THE GILDED AGE While the American industrial system and the status of the laborer were undergoing great changes from 1865 to 1890 , agriculture was experiencing a revolution no less momentous . The final results of this revolution are not yet apparent , but the main effect has been to lay the standardizing hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been laid on the laborer and the employer . Agriculture in the South. ? For the purpose of this study agriculture in the South is of relatively slight importance , though the great changes that the basic occupation underwent in the Kingdom of Cotton were paralleled by just as great changes in other portions of the country . Before the war three-fourths of southern agricultural products were produced by slave labor in fields that belonged to large landholders . The remainder of the products came from lands held by the despised middle class who were often struggling with dire pov-  | erty . After the war the tendency was for the large plantations to pass into the hands of the former slaves or the middle class . Not all the large estates were broken up , for tenant farming has been common in the South ever since 1865 , and with the passage of the years its importance has increased . In the last decade or two there is said to be an increasing tendency toward the system of large holdings worked by tenants or hired laborers . The war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other features of the old order have been retained . Along with the growth of large plantations on the plan of those before the war has gone the industrialization of agriculture . To-day machinery is much more prevalent and far more complicated than ever before . Fewer hands are required in the fields , and if it were not for the necessity of picking the cotton by hand , the same methods would be used in the fields of Alabama and Mississippi that prevail in the wheat fields of Kansas , Minnesota , and Washington . As it is , the southern farmer has lost much of his old-time independence and his mistrust of industrialism . In fact , he is in a fair way to be industrialized . The Exhaustion of Free Land : From the earliest days of settlement one of the dominant influences in American development , material , intellectual , and spiritual , was the presence on the western frontier of a vast amount of open land . The existence of that land determined the character of much of our politics , our economics , our thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Without the great reservoir of western land as one of the chief impelling forces in American life , much that is most significant in our history would never have occurred . Before the Civil War government land had been sold in varying amounts to speculators as well as to bona fide settlers , but none of it was given away as a home to the man who was willing to live on it . In 1862 the system was changed . Land was still sold , but any one could get a title to a homestead of 16o acres by living on it for a specified number of years . Under this impetus there was an unprecedented rush for public land , and within thirty years from the passage of the Homestead Act , the government officially announced the disappearance of the frontier and the virtual disappearance of our open land . It is absolutely true to say that these facts actually shocked all our society , and the shock was not confined to this country . Gone  | was the time when any man dissatisfied with his lot could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West where he would at least be his own master . Gone was the time when the farmer who had impoverished his land by careless methods could find virgin soil of great richness out on the frontier . Gone was the time when the laborers of the cities and the oppressed peasants of Europe could dream of finding a new and comfortable home on the open lands of western America . But most important of all , gone was the source of all that spiritual force and energy that Americans drew from the presence of free land , a knowledge that blossomed in our life in the shape of our optimism , our feeling of self-sufficiency , and our sustaining faith that every man is the captain of his own fate . After 189o , when the American farmer and laborer found conditions unpleasant , there was no possibility of obliterating them by romantic dreams of better days to come in the West . Facts had to be faced realistically ; romantic optimism was no longer in vogue . The passing of the free land caused a cry of distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what such an event meant to them . Mingled with the distress was an unmistakable note of anger , for millions of acres of the public domain had not gone into the hands of actual settlers but had become the property of land speculators and the railroad companies . Many Americans looked upon the directors of railroads as mere speculators , as indeed they were , for they were holding for a high market price the great areas that had been given them by an indulgent government . Every American social thinker during the Gilded Age considered land speculation one of the major crimes . The inability of farmers to get cheap land in the West forced them to pay an excessive price or a very high rent for lands in the older settled portions of the country . Laborers objected to land speculation on the same grounds , for they realized that so long as the price of land was kept high they would have a slender chance of becoming landowners . Henry George was the first man to state the fears of the American farmers and workers in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same fears their first literary expression . The Industrialization of Agriculture. ? The farmer of the earlier day had been almost completely self-supporting . He lived a simple life and had few material wants that could not be satisfied from the products of the farm . The land was tilled with the simplest and most inexpensive implements . The plow was altered scarcely at all  | from the design of Jefferson , and the other implements were not infrequently made on the farm . The horse was the source of all power used in the tilling of land and in the threshing of grain . Farm life was hard but very simple , and it offered a type of satisfaction that can come only from the individual 's ability to satisfy his own wants . This idyllic system was shattered by the industrialization of the nation . One of the chief faults of our modern industrial and selling methods is that they create desire to possess economic goods . When a wealthy person purchases a luxury or even a convenience , his example is followed by his well-to-do neighbor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural districts are infected and soon every one possesses an article that only the rich should purchase . The luxurious and extravagant display of our newly made millionaires during the Gilded Age was aped by all classes of people , rural as well as urban , and one of the first results of the pernicious habit was to throw the farmer into the way of spending more and more . Furthermore , the very processes of farming became more and more complicated . The old wooden walking plow gave way to a steel one , the steel one was followed by a riding plow , and this in turn by a more elaborate piece of machinery that in our generation has developed into eight or nine plows drawn by a tractor . The old-fashioned scythe was followed by a mowing machine . This was super . seded by a reaper that was soon made obsolete by a self-binder , and this last has been replaced on western wheat farms by a combined harvester that cuts , threshes , and sacks the grain in one operation . To-day most of those combines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields by tractors . The farmer was forced to industrialize his farm . His old way of raising grain was too expensive to allow of great profits , and the farmer was thinking of profits just as were the manufacturers and other business men . He had to raise grain to buy machinery to raise more grain to pay for more machinery , and so on in an endless sequence . His standard of living was raised , and while he handled much more money than he once did , he soon discovered to his dismay that he was not keeping much more of it than he had been . Hard times were chronic in the West from 1865 to the opening of the twentieth century , and even then , except for short periods , economic distress continued almost unrelieved .  | The result of all these changes in agriculture was to destroy much of the farmer 's traditional independence , to bring him into the industrial movement , to run him into debt for land and machinery and thus bring him closer into touch with the world of finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often thought a very bad one and then give him no way out . If the supply of free land had kept up indefinitely , the farmer might have maintained his feeling of independence , but the supply was exhausted . The farmer could only face the stubborn facts and try to work out his happiness in spite of untoward conditions . Like the laborer and the employer , he was industrialized . Romantic dreams could no longer bring him surcease of his desires . Realistic desires demand realistic satisfaction . PUBLIC MORALITY AND PRIVATE TASTE Political corruption and bad taste in architecture and literature were by no means introduced to American life for the first time during the Gilded Age , but that period certainly saw the most extensive and brazen bribery and graft that was ever perpetrated in the history of our nation , just as it saw erected many a monument to the atrocious artistic taste of our people . The reasons for both the political corruption and the deplorable private taste go back to the same ultimate source . The riotous and ostentatious extravagance that accompanied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led some men to sell their votes and influence and led others to erect marvels of bad taste in the effort to show that they were the happy possessors of great wealth . State and Local Political Corruption. ? There is probably no getting at the specific origin of the political corruption that disgraced the seventies , the Dreadful Decade as those years have been aptly called . Before the war certain state legislatures had been accused of selling bank charters and other concessions , but the dishonorable proceedings of the earlier period were swept into insignificance by the flood of political debauchery that followed in the wake of the war . However , let it be said that the war can not be blamed for all the unlovely aspects of the Gilded Age . Rather it was the mushroom growth of huge fortunes that corrupted our political life by substituting for the earlier American ideal of deliberate earning and saving a frenzied desire to grasp great wealth in a day by luck , by speculation , by any means that promised to capture the dollars . In  | an atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick wealth , it is very difficult to maintain untarnished political rectitude . Railroads and other private corporations insisted upon special privileges that usually meant immense illegitimate returns from the public , and they were willing and anxious to pay huge sums to public officials who would assist in the getting of such privileges . The war was scarcely over when The Nation , a weekly paper that kept up a consistent fight for common decency and honesty in the conduct of public affairs , charged that there was hardly a legislature in the country that was not suspected of corruption . Within five years enough scandals had been uncovered to show that the suspicion was not entirely imaginary . In the South the carpet-bag legislatures were indulging in an orgy of corruption that was a disgrace to civilization , and conditions in the North were not noticeably better . Open scandals occurred in a dozen northern and western states , and of these scandals that connected with the Erie Railroaa in New York was typical , though the New York legislature was probably no worse than many another . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erie Railroad . " Commodore " Vanderbilt attempted to dispossess Daniel Drew , Jay Gould , and Jim Fisk from their control of the road . None of the three attacked was noted for scrupulous honesty or for high ideals of public service . Drew managed to combine a hypocritical piety with the business morality of a pirate , and Gould was never known to sacrifice a penny to save friend or principle , but of the three Fisk was by far the most spectacular and audacious . He was the bloated figure of vulgar and ostentatious extravagance , possessing not the slightest vestige of public or private morality . Vanderbilt never withheld his hand from any business transactions because of conscientious scruples , but when he struck for the control of the Erie , he had probably not calculated exactly the corrupt resourcefulness of his three opponents . The struggle progressed from the stock market to pitched battles between gangs of hired thugs , then to corrupt courts , and finally culminated in the wholesale bribery of the state legislature . It was probably one of the most disgraceful performances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public opinion can be gauged very accurately by the fact that the voters of certain New York legislative districts were outraged , not because their representatives had sold out , but because the improvident men had sold out for less than the
