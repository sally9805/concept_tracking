txt RIVERSIDE DRIVE . A Dweller on It Writes of Its Manifold Attractions . To the Editor of The New York Times : Only those who habitually frequent Riverside Drive on these Summer evenings , when the atmosphere is of a nature to invite one to leave the city , can fully appreciate what this part of Manhattan is doing for its citizens . Where else is to be found a more magnificent river than the Hudson , which lends both beauty and comfort to the ' , rive , with it , p plentiful supply of benches , and parks that are as so many oases in the overheated metropolis ? A stone 's throw from crowded Broadway , and you are where you can enjoy something akin to the countryside . If the evening is one when moon and stars reflect their silver sheen on the surface of the slowly moving water , the picture is indeed of enchanting beauty , and as steamers , bright with innumerable lights , pass up and down the river , imagination takes wings , and even the hundreds upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mar the scene as it takes possession of one receptive to such impreseons . And as it is today , what will It not be when once the railroad along the Hudson bids good-bye , and the recovered land adds to what is already now a breathing place of unexampled attractiveness ? The engineers of the New York Central are doing their best to speed the day when neither smoke nor shrill whistle will detract from the general peace and harmony of Riverside Drive . It has taken a long time to bring about this coming improvement , but the more will it be appreciated when once it has become an accomplished fact . A word should not be amiss anent the transportation facilities on Riverside Drive . The writer does not hold a brief for the bus company , but the patronage speaks for itself as showing what it means to the community . As the bus sweeps into the Drive from Seventy-second Street , it is , like entering another world to be atop one of these coaches and drink in the scene that unravels before one 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clings close to the river may claim the major attention , on the opposite side of the roadway there is also much of interest . The various monuments standing here and there tell their own story to those who care to study the historical meaning they convey . And then there is that most wonderful monument of all , the tribute to the man who spoke the words of peace engraved over the portal of his final resting-place . The architectural simplicity of the Grant Tomb is in entire keeping with the pastoral environment near the river . There is another monument of a different nature which will before long add its utility and interest to the Drive as the Hudson River Bridge connects the shores of the New York and New Jersey Commonwealths . And then , at the furthest end of Riverside Drive lies the tract of land that John D. Rockefeller Jr . has offered to the city of New York and which , If accepted , and the plans carried out as suggested , will be a further attraction , as it abuts on the Drive itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitting stanzas will sing the praise of Riverside Drive so that all will listen . In the meantime , may this slight tribute be offered from one who never fails to appreciate what nature and the ingenuity of the landscape artist have here accomplished with such excellent effect . JulauS MORITZEN . New York , July 3 , 1930 . The Late Robert W. Ferguson . To the Editor of The New York Times : The newspapers recorded the sudden death on June 28 of Robert W. Ferguson . To most people the name will mean nothing , but to a good number , especially among bank men , his death will bring up memories of a unique personality . Mr. Ferguson was connected with the New York Clearing House from 1883 literally to the day of his death , for he died in the Clearing House actively engaged in his customary duties almost to the last minute of his life . He held various positions of trust and was true to them all . In recent years he had occupied the responsible position of chief of the city collection department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for granted , and only when they have gone do we realize how we depended upon them . Such a man was Mr. Ferguson . With integrity that was beyond question , he has left a reputation for loyal service that may be equaled but can never be excelled . C. E. BACON . New York , July 2 , 1930 . A Tragedy of the Road . To the Editor of The New York Times : Yesterday , on the Federal road , a tragedy occurred , making a new species of victim to progress . A hen partridge and her brood , on a curve in the road , were surprised by a fast automobile . The old lady , as instinct taught her , clucked a warning to her chicks , who scattered , hiding themselves in the roadside thicket . The mother trotted toward the other side of the road , to divert attention from her brood . She was too slow . The automobile crushed her . There she lay , car after car passing heedlessly over her body . Probably the motherless chicks perished for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many larger animals lying crushed in the path of our juggernauts . But mother partridge and her self-sacrifice was too much for this most blas ? of hearts . G. M. HAUSHALTER . Wiscasset , Me. , July 1 , 1930 . Why Not " First Call , " &c.?; To the Editor of The New York Times : " The New Yorker " .. is a train leaving the Grand Central at 11:45 Daylight Saving Time for Boston . On it , to announce lunch , a waiter from the dining car walks through the other cars playing on a musical instrument I do n't know the name of . I will call it a portable metal xylophone . What he plays is " Taps . " I suppose that on the limited trains where extra fares afford all luxuries , there is a small brass band made up of waiters and rendering " The Dead March " from Saul .
