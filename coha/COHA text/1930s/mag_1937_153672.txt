Priests in heavily ornate robes stood in the pulpits of the principal Serbian Orthodox Churches in Yugoslavia last Sunday , and slowly read out the names of 141 members of Parliament , nine Cabinet Ministers , including that of Yugoslavia 's Premier Milan Stoyadinovich . In Belgrade stolid worshipers listened in grim silence , but in other churches congregations throughout the countryside piously ejaculated " May He Be Damned ! " as each name was pronounced . <P> All on the list had been temporarily excommunicated from the Serbian Orthodox Church for supporting a Concordat with the Vatican ; all were due to appear for trial before an ecclesiastical court ( TIME , Aug. 9 et ante ) . <P> While hundreds of thousands of Orthodox adherents boasted that the Premier would have to resign in face of such widespread opposition , he remained obdurate , forbade press mention of the pulpit denunciation , refused to recognize that members of Parliament could be held responsible " by any court even ecclesiastical " for the votes they cast .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
