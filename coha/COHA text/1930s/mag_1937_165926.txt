" BELOVED FRIEND " - Catherine Drinker Bowen &; Barbara von Meek-Random House ( $3 ) . Any musician runs the risk of being thought queer , but Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky ran a bigger risk than most . Just how queer he actually became was related last week by Authors von Meek &; Bowen , in a full-dress , 484-page biography that Tchaikovsky addicts will find sympathetic , non-musical readers interesting if partly incomprehensible . With only a slight stiffening of technical talk and musical illustration , " Beloved Friend " is a revealing human document on the genus musician , Russian species . Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky , known to friend &; foe alike as " the culmination- almost the last stand-of the Romantic Movement in music , " was a Petersburg law student of 22 when he first became seriously interested in music . Once he caught fire he blazed up . But he had no money , had to support himself by teaching a heavy schedule at Rubinstein 's Moscow Conservatory . At 37 he had become a composer but he was still just a music-teacher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widow of a railroad tycoon and Moscow 's richest woman , to get her to do something for Tchaikovsky , he started more than he intended . <P> When Nadejda heard her first Tchaikovsky music she liked it so much she gave the composer a commission to write something for her . Soon they were in frequent and increasingly intimate correspondence . Nadejda had 12 children and was very much the head of her family . She had a whim of iron , and it was her strongest whim never to appear in public , never to be at home to anyone but her own kin ( Rubinstein was apparently the lone exception ) . As her epistolary friendship with Tchaikovsky grew , her commissions got more munificent , her language ever more affectionate , until finally she was supporting Tchaikovsky and their letters to each other were more platonic than respectable .
