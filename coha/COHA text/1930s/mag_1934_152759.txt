Potshots at the President-elect , a bank holiday , a many-decked New Deal , a World Fair , Mae West , the midget on Mr. Morgan 's lap , Repeal , Rolphing- last year they all laid headlines across the country , inked rotogravures , filled newsreels drumtight and gave Vanity Fair 's ( then ) Cinemacritic Pare Lorentz an idea . With an eye on Laurence Stallings ' photostory , The First World War ( whose pictures have boomed in more than 50 newspapers-TIME , Feb. 26 ) , Cinemacritic Lorentz edited the pictures of the first New Deal year , pictures of the war on Depression .

Grisly shot : the naked , charred body of Negro Warner , lynched &; burned near St. Joseph , Mo . <P> Editor Lorentz paces his captions to the measure of war , does a thorough piece of reporting in his running commentary on last year 's history .

Compiled by Dr. Joseph Yu. head of Shanghai 's Nantao Clinic , it presents 87 pages of war pictures which Dr. Yu took with a Brownie , seven pages of advertisements ( venereal cures , toothpastes , virility drugs , sun lamps ) .
