txt Amid increasing signs of alarm in the administration over the recession of business , President Roosevelt continued today his conferences with his advisers on the crisis . At the close of the day , beset by conI Aiding counsels and faced by waning confidence in his economic panaceas even within his official family , the President faced a dilemma on which way to turn . He now confronts the necessity of deciding whether to order a " retreat from Moscow " to more conservative policies calculated to reassure the business world or to give the country 's economic system another shot in the arm of inflation or a billion dollar spending of public funds , which would reanimate business enterprise . Fear Inflation Decision . Those who know Mr. Roosevelt best and know his reluctance to confess a mistake look for the President to turn to inflation or spending or both in preference to any acknowledged abandonment of the radical policies that are widely - , reputed to have chilled private enterprise . On one flank , however , the Presi ? dent has given the signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , . That is on the tax flank . The *4 on undivided profits , which some of the President 's closest advisers admit has , checked business expansion , is to be not repealed for that would be a confession of error ) but very greatly modified . Administration leaders in congress received word from the President to go ahead with revision of the surplus profits taX and also the capital gains and profits tax which likewise is un . der fire as a deterrent of investment . Modification of these soak-the  --  rich taxes will not take place , however , until the regular session of congress beginning in January . although the ways and means committee has been at work on the problem for the last ten days , having - begun it a month earlier than scheduled because of the pressing necessity felt by the- administration to do something to halt the business recession . Immediate Action Needed . With industry slackening further and further and stocks steadily slumping , however , alarm began to permeate the administration and the President was convinced that something more immediately effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avert what many fear is a Roomvest depression in the making . That is the explanation of the procession of Roosevelt advisers to Hyde Park in the last few weeks and now currently to the White House , all hastily summoned by the President to counsel him what to do about the crisis . Joseph P. Kennedy , chairman of the maritime commission , former chairman of the Securities and Exchange commission , a stock market millionaire who " talks turkey " to Mr. Roosevelt and enjoys presidential confidence , is reputed to have wrung from the President at Hyde Park the 0 . K. on tax revision . Demands Balanced Budget . Information percolating from the White House depicts the President 's advisers running around in circles , each with a pet project for stopping the Roosevelt depression . Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau astounded everybody , including the President , by pounding the presidential desk under the presidential nose and declaiming that nothing short of balancing the budget is going to calm the apprehensions of the business community and speed up the wheels of industry . Mr. Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing the reaction of lousiness to possible measures for meet , ing the crisis , in a speech in ' New York tomorrow . Marriner S. Eccles , chairman of the federal reserve board , urged the President to return to a generous spending program to increase purchasing power . He thought not less than a billion dollars would be necessary for this campaign in the next . year . The balancing of the budget would be delayed thereby , but only temporarily . Only a few months ago Eccles served notice on the President that unless the budget were balanced promptly a ruinous inflation would result . Eccles changes his mind frequently , however , particularly under presidential pressure . He was against revising the stock market margin requirements until Mr. Roosevelt nudged him . Confers with Several . Today Mr. Roosevelt conferred with Secretary Morgenthau , Secretary of , Agriculture Wallace , Representative Marvin Jones D. , Tex. , chairman of the house agriculture committee ; Representative Robert L. Doughton D. , N. C. , chairman of the house ways and means committee , and Representative Fred M. Vinson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax subcommittee . Doughton said taxes were discussed , and Mr. Roosevelt at his press conference would not enlarge upon this statement . Nor would he disclose where he is getting , if anywhere , on the business crisis . Asked whether he was still confident that he will balance the budget in the fiscal year which begins next July 1 , in view of the information he has received in two days of conferences with spending , fiscal , and congressional leaders , Mr. Roosevelt answered that he hoped so . Discusses Utilities Situation . Apparently apropos of the assertion of the Public Utility Executives ' committee that but for the administration 's antagonism to private utilities they would be expending 31/2 billions on construction the President had prepared for the press conference by digging up his observations to the press in 1934 . He said he had not changed his view as then expressed that there would be no conflict between government and the utilities if they would return to the old English law of property valuation .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
