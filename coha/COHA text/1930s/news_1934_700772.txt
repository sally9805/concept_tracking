txt Relearning an Old Lesson . One hundred and twenty years ago my grandfather came to the backwoods of Nova Scotia from Scotland with a capital of about $100 . Buying a piece of untouched woodland , to be paid for in instalments , he with prodigious energy converted it into a flourishing farm , with substantial buildings and good stock , on which he and his family made a comfortable living . The government of his adopted country did nothing for him ; on the contrary , by granting the land to favorites , it made him pay a price much higher than it was worth . And now , long after the early settlers had demonstrated that If given access to land men can make a living , we have our national government spending millions of dollars on subsistence projects , designed to prove that by working on th land men can grow foodstuffs . Truly a remarkable discovery ! WHIDDEN GRAHAM . New York , Aug. 30 , 1934.                 @ @ @ @
