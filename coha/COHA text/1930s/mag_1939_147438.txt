The Union of South Africa 's aging Prime Minister James Barry Munnik Hertzog , who , with a Bible in his pocket and a bandoleer over his shoulder , fought for three years against Great Britain in the Boer War , guessed that his people would not want to fight for Britain in this one . For the Union is made up of four polyglot provinces , two Crown colonies and controls by League mandate a former colony of Germany 's , and the outstanding element in its history has been the internal clash of nationalities-natives , Dutchmen , Britons , Germans-not its interest in Europe 's troubles . <P> When World War I broke out , the Assembly of the Union of South Africa voted unenthusiastically to join on Britain 's side - so unenthusiastically that there was a short , angry civil war before South Africa was able to turn on its German neighbor , South West Africa , and conquer it . After the War national lines were sharper than ever . The rise of the Hitler regime in Germany was reflected in South Africa by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian Ocean . Last April it was rumored the Nazis were ready to seize South West Africa . <P> South Africa 's Boers , however , are passionately anxious to maintain control over South West Africa . They would rather see the world 's richest gold and diamond mines , the Rand and Kimberley , exploited by Britain than raped by Germany . The Boer leader who gets on best with Britain is white-bearded old Jan Christiaan Smuts , soldier of the Boer and World Wars , national hero and ex-Prime Minister . <P> And so the day after Prime Minister Hertzog told the House of Assembly that his Government 's policy would " continue as if no war were being waged " he found that he had guessed wrong . Out he went , in went General Smuts . For by another unenthusiastic Assembly vote ( 80-to-66 ) the Union scrambled on the Empire war-wagon , hellbent for the precipice . <P> &gt; Canada also scrambled aboard last week , requested King George VI to proclaim that " a state of war exists between Canada and Germany " - which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate in three ways : ship munitions to England , feed airmen into the Royal Air Force , defend herself . The last of these she was pitifully unprepared to do . <P> Sworn in as Finance Minister , to take the lead out of Canada 's pants and put some silver in , was one of Canada 's cleverest financial men , Colonel James Layton Ralston . A corporation lawyer who spends his spare time loafing with dory fishermen on the Nova Scotia coast , fishing and eating lobsters , he has long refused to nibble Cabinet bait . But once in , he was expected because of his bulldog tenacity and narrow partisanship to become the Government 's strongest man . <P> &gt; Northern Ireland was in , and only Eire , of the Empire 's major members , was out . But Eire 's neutrality was summed up by an official who released the crew of a British seaplane forced down in a remote harbor of Eire . Said he : " Sure , we 're neutral , but who are we neutral against ? "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
