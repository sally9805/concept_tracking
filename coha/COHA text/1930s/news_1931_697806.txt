txt " It 's almost as hard to leave here as it was to leave home . " Bryan Untiedt of Towner , Col. , who had been the guest of the President and Mrs. Hoover for four days , was standing on the platform of the westbound Liberty Limited as he spoke . There was a warning whistle and the train slowly began to gather headway . The 13-year-old boy , whose heroism in a Colorado blizzard attracted the attention of the President , was on his way home . Shyly he summed up his impressions of his stay at the Executive Mansion . " Most everything was nice , " he said . " What impressed me most ? I do n't know hardly  --  Washington sure is pretty and everybody has been as good as they could be . A strange place is all right after you get to know people , and I got to know people right away . " What did I think about Mr. Hoover ? Well , I 'll tell you . He 's an awfully nice man , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you forget all about his being President . Yes , I told him about us getting caught in the snow . " The boy had began to talk freely , but he grew silent under questions about his experiences in the blizzard .. Then at mention of Mrs. Hoover his face lighted up . " She 's awfully nice , " he said , enthusiastically . " She does everything she can to make you feel at home . She 's just as fine as she can be . " " And so was everybody else , for that matter , " he added . " What impressed me most ? You asked me that once before . Well , I never saw anything before like the White House . " I liked Mount Vernon , too . It was pretty down- there . And Lindbergh 's plane . I almost forgot that . Say , it did n't look as big , somehow , as I thought it would . I do n't hardly see how he got across in it , do you ? There was a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the like . I like airplanes . Will I fly one ? I do n't know . " The King of Siam ? Yes , I saw him and the Queen , too . " The boy paused and laughed . " What was I laughing at ? I just happened to think of something funny . It did n't have anything to do with the King and Queen . " Is my father a Democrat or a Republican ? " He laughed again and ran his hand through his hair . " Well , if you want to know , my dad is a Democrat . Seems sort of funny the way things turned out . Will he vote for Mr. Hoover after this ? You 'll have to ask him . Lot to Tell at Home . " It 'll be nice to ' get home , at that . I 've got a lot to tell . Why do n't I tell it now ? You know how it is . You do n't think of ' it till afterward . " The train  --  was moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Washington with him in his hands . " Yes . I took some pictures , and I 've got my harmonica . I 've got everything , I reckon . " " I 'll send you a picture of you and the President , if you-want it , " a photographer called . " Gee , that 'll be fine , " called the boy over the noise of the train . " Send it to Towner , R. F. D. ? " but the photographer could not hear the number . " Never mind , " Bryan shouted . " Send it to Towner . Maybe they 'll know me out there . " Evaded White House Interview . Special to The New York Times . WASHINGTON , May 2 . ? Theodore Joslin , secretary to President Hoover , yesterday promised the newspaper correspondents who regularly cover the White House that he would arrange an interview with Bryan- Untiedt for a limited number .. The interview was to be given immediately after President Hoover 's conference with the press . A stenographer was to record the proceeding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that reproduces Presidential announcements . Bryan had not been told of the arrangement , however , and he was witnessing a high school baseball game . When he returned it was too late to interrupt his dinner , so ' Mr. Joslin announced that the : nterview would be postponed until 9:30 this morning . A committee of six newspaper men was on hand then , ready and waiting . Everything was set for the interview except notifying Bryan . Mr. Joslin went to do this , but returned with the information that Bryan refused to be interviewed . He had pledged whatever stories he might give out to The Denver Post . Furthermore , he had promised his father to talk to no one save one certain man on The Denver Post . Before departing today Bryan played his harmonica once more for Mrs. Hoover and her grandchildren . He was reported to have played a modern tune that he picked up while on his visit here .

Bryan was trim-looking and smiling when he came out of the door of the White House to get into a big automobile for the trip to the station . He had taken leave of President and Mrs. Hoover and other members of the White House family before going to the portico . He paused to shake hands with a Negro footman , walked straight to the automobile without looking either to the right or left , and was whisked away toward the Union Station . The only direct quotation he had left behind was : " Well , yes , I 'm having a fine time . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
