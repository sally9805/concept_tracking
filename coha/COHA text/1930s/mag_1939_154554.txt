Month ago the U. S. War Department planked out $25,009,388 for a whopping rush order of airplane engines . To Allison Engineering Co. , a newcomer in high-powered aeronautics , went the fattest slice : $15,080,261 . Old-established Wright Aeronautical Corp . and Pratt &; Whitney ( already fat with Army contracts ) came off second and a poor third ( Wright : $8,975,317 ; Pratt &; Whitney $953,810 ) . Reason : Army men favored the Allison 1,200-h.p. engine ( TIME , Jan. 30 ) , whose twelve inline cylinders , snug as a whippet 's ears , made it the last word in streamlined high-output power . <P> Ever since Colonel Lindbergh flew one across the Atlantic in 1927 , most U. S. aeronautical engineers have been developing air-cooled , radial engines with cylinders raying out like huge wheel-spokes around a short , chunky crankshaft . But as power was increased , radial engines grew so bulky that they dragged on high-speed planes . <P> Last week , however , it was Pratt &; Whitney 's turn to smile all over its corporate face . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A19 motored by an engine of the old radial , air-cooled type that was half again as powerful as the Allison . Weighing slightly less per horsepower than the Allison , it could fit into small pursuit planes as snugly as a cartridge in a rifle breech . <P> Their pride &; joy resembled the 14-cylinder , 1,200-h.p . Twin-Wasp motor but had four more cylinders , some 50% more horsepower , about the same dimensions . Secret-of-success : through trial &; error engineers had learned to cool high-powered air-cooled engines more efficiently , thus were able to clump more cylinders around a single crankshaft . Better cooling also made it possible to increase cylinder pressures , step up speed of piston strokes . <P> Meantime all plane makers heard heartening news . In 1922 , when British Aeronautic Engineer Frederick Handley Page took out U. S. patents on his wing slot , a safety device to control spinning and stalling , * he demanded a fancy price for installation : about 5% of the plane 's cost ( as much as $25,000 for a DC-4 ) . Too costly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infringe on British patents , wing slots were rarely used . Many a flier crashed who might otherwise have been saved . <P> Last week Engineer Page 's patents expired , wing slots became available to everybody . <P> <P> *Which occurs when , as a result of climbing too steeply , the smooth flow of air over wing tops becomes disturbed , destroys their lifting power . Wing slots admit a stream of air to the wing top through vents in the leading edge of the wings .
