For His Holiness MILLIONS of persons throughout the world , Your Holiness , have sympathized most deeply with vou in your recent illness , and in the months and years of physical and mental suffering that , as everyone knows , preceded it . For some , the sympathy and hope for your recovery have been extended to Pope Pius XI , the head of their Church ; but all others possessed of any human sensibilities , regardless of their religion , must have felt for you in your predicament . To the infirmities of age and disease there has been added the deep unhappiness of seeing almost all mankind plunged into an era of miserable suffering , of hatred and the desire for revenge . of war and the threat of war . Naturally , your concern has been greatest of all for the members of your own flock , and they in particular have been more profoundly disturbed , in many countries , than ever before in the history of the Church . Catholic property has been seized in more than one land ; Catholic priests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which their lives are dedicated ; priests and laymen in several countries have suffered imprisonment or an even worse fate for carrying out what they sincerely believe to be God 's commands . The suffering , mental and physical , brought about by this tragic train of events has left its mark not only upon your Holiness but many other members of your faith , including both official representatives and lay communicants . Even in the United States , now probably the richest segment of Catholicism in the world and certainly the one least troubled by the angry winds of dissension , the burden of the times is reflected in an increasing sharpness of temper , a passionate querulousness , among many of its spokesmen . To a non-Catholic reader of American church periodicals , the bitter emotion displayed by their contributors , the inability ? no doubt an honest inability ? to review all the facts of any situation involving the Church , almost suggest that these commentators are suffering , en masse , from a nervous breakdown : and few could blame them if this were true . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-Catholic who is in favor of liberty for all religion , in all parts of the world , provided that such liberty does not itself infringe upon other rights of the general population , and provided in particular that it does not encroach upon the political sphere . I can only excuse my presumption by saying that serious as are the difficulties in which your Church finds itself today , tomorrow looks blacker still . For the first time in generations , the Church is now caught up in a political alliance of profound significance and unpredictable but enormously important consequences . Partially this situation is accidental , but in part , it is the result of what seems a succession of blunders in judgment by your advisers at Vatican City ? blunders sufficiently serious to justify public comment such as mine . The first of these blunders was the agreement in 1929 with the Mussolini government . I recognize how desperate was the problem the Church confronted before this agreement , in its internal Italian affairs , and I. am well aware of the enormous advantages , first of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world as a whole received the impression that the Church was prepared to condone and did in fact condone not only the crushing of all liberty throughout the Italian state and its colonies , but the methods used to bring this about : the torturing of thousands of opponents of the regime , the murder of many of them by the firing squad or by the administration of castor oil , the exile to waterless islands of most of the fine spirits in the Italian world save those who were killed or the small proportion who managed to escape to a foreign country . This blow at the moral prestige of the Church became far more serious when Italy undertook the conquest of Ethiopia . However often other countries had performed similar acts in the past , it is nevertheless true that in the fourth decade of the twentieth century there was a genuine collective rejection by all decent people everywhere of this act of spoliation . There seems no doubt that the Vatican not only failed to protest against this example of barbarism but participated in it , permitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion to the soldiers as they departed and zealously arranging a bargain under which all non-Catholic missionaries should be expelled from " Italian " Ethiopia . A second blunder , it seems to me , has been the official participation of the Church in the Spanish rebellion . I am well aware that you yourself have carefully refrained from active intervention in the dispute , and that despite the great pressure upon you to do so , you have not given formal recognition to General Franco 's " government . " But lesser figures than yourself in the Church , throughout the world , have not been so scrupulous ? or careful . I know about the theory that there is a large degree of autonomy in the Church in one country or another ; but I am aware , too , that the things done by thousands of loyal Catholics , in Spain and elsewhere , would not have been done if there were any reason to believe that Rome would object . In the Iberian Peninsula , everyone in the world knows that the Church is participating wholeheartedly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with guns . Catholics in other lands have ( with certain honorable exceptions ) been quick to declare their sympathies . Catholic journalism on the whole took the rebel side from the beginning , and has displayed the characteristic psychology of the partisan in wartime . If a worldwide conflagration grows out of the Spanish affair , your Church will shoulder a great part of the odium . A third mistake , if I read the meaning of events correctly , has been the recent partial understanding with the government of Germany . Here , again , it is easy to perceive the tremendous pressure under which Vatican City found itself . The position of the Catholics in Germany has been unhappy in the extreme , like that of Protestants , Jews , liberals , pacifists and radicals . Nevertheless , the new understanding will inevitably be interpreted around the world as another indication that the Church , on the rather faint hope of bettering the lot of some of its own communicants , has been willing to condone the actions of a despicable regime . Among the most serious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crusade against communism , announced with such a flourish a few weeks ago , a crusade in which non-Catholics as well as members of the faith are invited to join , although there is no suggestion that these non-Catholics will assume any role other than that of privates in the rear ranks . It was of course impossible for the Church to foresee that within a short period of time , another worldwide attack upon communism would be announced , by Germany and Japan , with the inevitable adherence of Italy , Austria and Hungary a little later . It is not surprising that in the public mind , these two crusades should now be indivisibly fused into one , and that everywhere the picture should be seen of the fascist dictatorships and the Vatican engaged in a joint adventure . People in one country or another will of course describe that crusade in terms which vary with their own preconceptions . For my part , I think history will sustain the view that it is not a fight between communism on the one hand and the forces of peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communism and fascism as philosophies . The essential division in the world today is between the fascist dictatorships and the democracies . These democracies differ widely in their principles and practices , but the gulf between any two of them is far less wide than the gulf between all of them and such powers as the governments of Germany , Japan and Italy . In this great separation of the world into two camps , your Church , for reasons which are partly accidental and all thoroughly explicable , has ranged itself on the wrong side . It stands today with the forces of cruelty and terror . It stands with those who deny the power of reason , the effectiveness of abstract truth . It supports policies that can only be made to work by the enslavement of whole populations , by the destruction of freedom of every type , by a return to conditions paralleling those of the Dark Ages , but even worse because men today have an alternative of which the Dark Ages knew nothing . If I am right , this is the most tragic blunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harder to explain because this worldwide " crusade against communism " comes at a moment when the threat of communism is less than it has been at any time since the end of the Great War . Fifteen years ago , there were people working for a universal series of revolutions who believed they had hope of immediate success . Today , the one important country that lives under communism has abandoned the effort immediately to influence other lands except through successful example . In the two outstanding democracies , Great Britain and the United States , the Communists are negligible in numbers and in influence . In other countries such as France and Spain , the Communist Parties have thrown themselves into united-front movements in which they are not the preponderant force and in which they cooperate even with the mildest of progressives , on these mild progressives ' own terms . No informed person in the world can believe that the general threat of communism is sufficiently serious today to have brought about this Unholy Alliance . We are told that , historically , the hostility of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Soviet Russia . As to this there are three points to be made . The first is that it was the Greek Catholic Church , and not your own , which controlled the formal religious life of Russia in the days of the Tsar . Even in the most remote and most backward Latin American countries , Roman Catholicism has never been more irreligious , more sunk in superstition . more indifferent to the suffering of its communicants or more unashamedly venal , than was the Greek Catholic Church in the old days . Second , your anti-communist campaign comes almost at the same moment that a new constitution is promulgated in the U.S.S.R. guaranteeing freedom of religious worship . Third , the attitude of radicals in general toward the question of religion seems to be widely misunderstood by your faith and others . It is true that throughout the world , a majority of those who are seeking to reorganize the economic basis of society are themselves indifferent or hostile to formal religious activity . Their chief quarrel with the churches , however , is based on two grievances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem not without reason . The first is the insistence of all organized religion everywhere upon the right to instill its doctrines into the minds of children too young to be capable of a dispassionate judgment . The second is the disturbing tendency of a majority of churches everywhere in the world to ally themselves with organized wealth as against the rights and necessities of the common man . In the case of your own Church , in particular , this has been accompanied in many countries by the acquisition of great wealth , wealth which has without doubt had an influence upon the general policies of the religious body . To repeat : It seems to me quite clear that the Church is blundering badly when it casts in its lot with the autocrats , with the merciless foes of humanitarianism , science , the cultural heritage of the ages . Your people , throughout the world , are the poor and lowly . In the long run , the Church must take the side of the poor and lowly , or they will find other voices to which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the point of the sword . BRUCE BLIVEN . Washington Notes The Fight Over the 117 . P.1 Rolls ? Mr. Hopkins and a Public Welfare Department ? The Probable Senate Line-up T HE DISMISSAL of WPA. workers , now in progress , is t : : e first skirmish in a fight likely to occupy a large part of the next congressional session . The battle lines in this fight have become confused to an extraordinary degree by rivalries among Cabinet officers , government exper:s and factions of the Democratic majority in Congress . It is not at all certain that the just demands or the unemployed will be met . Most of the quarreling groups within the government are ready to accept the premise that unemployment , under our present system , is permanent . The WPA has worked up figures that show the past history of unemployment in manufacturing . transportation , construction and mining . In these four realms of industry alone , unemployment during the 1920 's ranged from 1,500,000 to 3.500,000 . The WPA statisticians believe that even if we recapture the 1929 volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 6,500,000 to 7,500,000 jobless , partly because we now have a larger working population and partly because the efficiency of labor has increased . The average monthly WPA wage today is $53.50 . That is distressingly small , but it is as large as or larger than the average wage in many marginal industries ? cigarettes , canning , certain branches of textiles . There can be no doubt that the government 's relief program is an important factor in sustaining the present national wage structure . No one in the administration wants to reduce the rate of WPA wages . In any case , it is felt that such a move would be politically impossible . The controversy , therefore , comes down to the number of individuals who are to be cared for on the WPA rolls . On this point there is violent disagreement within the administration . Many officials are now convinced that the government 's first duty is to halt its deficit financing . They believe that continued government borrowing , and continued downward pressure on interest rates , will bring about a quick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are immensely alarmed by this prospect . But obviously the administration can not both keep on with its present relief program and at the same time cease borrowing , unless it is prepared to inaugurate new and heavier taxes . It is believed that Mr. Roosevelt is completely unwilling to do this . As usual , it is very difficult to find out exactly where Mr. Roosevelt stands . One thing seems certain : Mr. Roosevelt is personally responsible for the present attempt to cut 150,000 workers from the WPA rolls . All sources agree that , during the campaign , he became greatly disturbed over WPA spending . As soon as the votes of the VPA workers were safely counted , he is supposed to have given the order for dismissals . There is also evidence that Mr. Roosevelt has been impressed by arguments in favor of balancing the budget . An enthusiastic dilettante in economics , he is reported to be fascinated by the possibility of controlling the coming boom by monetary management .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
