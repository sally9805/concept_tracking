In London , where any temperature above 80 is called a heat wave , it was so hot last week that ten extra waiters were engaged to serve cooling drinks to perspiring legislators in the House of Commons terrace restaurant . A woman fainted from heat in a Gravesend bus and , as her collapse wedged her inextricably between the seats , the whole bus had to be driven to the hospital . An unseasonable drought half ruined the strawberry crop ( strawberries and clotted Devonshire cream is a favorite English dish this time of year ) , but the countryside had seldom looked greener . Elsewhere in Europe the heat wave also spread : <P> In The Netherlands , where De Bilt Observatory labels any temperature above 88 as " tropical , " the thermometer registered 93 . At The Hague , retired Dutch colonials got out their old tropical outfits , relics of Java days ; schools were closed afternoons , and young boys stripped and dived into the city 's canals to cool off . The Hague used 50% more water than usual . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on leave thought the temperature bearable . Lack of rain hurt the Belgian fruit crop . Karlstad , Swedish manufacturing town , had the hottest weather for Scandinavia ( 86 ) , and Stockholm consumed 183,400 cubic meters ( 48,417,600 gallons ) of water in one day . Drought meant bad crops and forest fires for Sweden . Copenhagen reported three deaths from sunstroke . <P> In Poland , with the heat at 90 , seven persons drowned while bathing in the Vistula . In Moscow , where fortnight ago overcoats were still in order , the temperature rose to 79 . The temperature reached 93 in France , sending practically all of Paris to sipping beer and lemonade in outdoor cafes or to swimming in the dozens of floating pools in the Seine . Mid-week thunder showers brought relief . <P> A German heat wave was too much for the " volunteers " home from Spain . As they paraded by their sweating Fhrer , many of them fainted . The asphalt on Berlin 's Via Triumphalis was so soft that no tanks or cars with caterpillar treads were allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blossomed out in the new white ceremonial jacket which correspondents labeled the " Axis coat , " since it first appeared at the signing of the Italian-German alliance . <P> In Spain , diplomats have moved from Burgos , which Spaniards claim is Spain 's hottest spot in summer and coldest in winter , to San Sebastin , on the Bay of Biscay , and Generalissimo Franco planned to pass the summer in a new seaside home presented to him by the nation near his birthplace at El Ferrol , in Galicia , recently renamed El Ferrol del Caudillo in his honor .
