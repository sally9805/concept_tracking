Not until the Supreme Court finally passes upon its constitutionality will President Roosevelt 's recovery program be out of the judicial woods . When that time comes the U.S. may have left the depression far behind and the points at issue may be as dead , for all practical purposes , as the Missouri Compromise of 1820 was in 1857 when the Supreme Court reviewed it in the Dred Scott case . <P> Last week President Roosevelt won his opening legal skirmish on the National Recovery Act in the District of Columbia Supreme Court . A Texas refiner attacked his executive order prohibiting the interstate shipment of " hot oil , " sought to enjoin Secretary of the Interior Ickes from enforcing it . In a free &; easy decision which ducked the issue of constitutionality Justice Joseph Winston Cox refused to grant the injunction . Declared he : <P> " Congress has declared that a great national emergency exists and has invested the President with extraordinary power to meet that emergency . ... It is recognized that necessity confers many rights and privileges that without the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the first law and this principle , in some degree at least , seems to extend to governments . . . . There is another maxim that ' safety of the people is the supreme law ' and all these must be considered in dealing with emergencies . All laws should be read in emergencies in the light of the law of necessity . " <P> The one man in Washington who refuses to recognize the " law of necessity " or any other law that is not in black &; white is Comptroller General John Raymond McCarl . With Comptroller McCarl the President 's NRA program collided for the first time last week , and came off second best . <P> A Nebraska Republican , Mr. McCarl went to Washington as Senator Norris ' secretary . He managed the famed Congressional campaign of 1918 and was made the first chief of the new General Accounting Office by President Harding on July 1 , 1921 . By law he holds office for 15 years , is ineligible for reappointment , can be removed only by Congress . Politically independent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its checkbook and therefore the best-hated man in public service . He interprets the literal law of Congress as to how money should be spent and from his decisions there is no appeal . The legal authority for spending 5 is as important to him as a $1,000,000,000 appropriation . A short , florid man , he is personally affable , officially inexorable . <P> The Federal penitentiary at Atlanta is making 500,000 yd. of duck cloth for the bleaching and shrinking of which the Department of Justice has a contract at 2 ? per yd. with Delta Finishing Co. of Philadelphia . The finished product the Department of Justice sells to the War Department at a fixed price . With the job about half done , the Delta concern lately informed the Justice Department that it was now operating under an NRA code , that costs had gone up 35% , that it could not complete its contract without more money from the U.S. The Justice Department was agreeable , provided the War Department paid more . Attorney General Cummings put the issue up to Comptroller McCarl who ruled last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
