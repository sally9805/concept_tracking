BRIEF ITEM IN TIME OF PEACE A STORY BY MORRIS MARKEY A t. right , you can call it tough luck . There were forty-eight of them in that turret when she blew , and they went out like chalk rubbed off a blackboard . But listen to me . There were two gobs on that ship who had tougher luck  --  they had tougher luck than anybody in the world ever had , and I was one of them . Even this is better than being in the Navy after taking that one on the chin . Have a drink . ( This was in a town called Crescent City , in California . He was the barman in a dreary little speakeasy that looked out over the dreary gray of the Pacific Ocean . Two old men were praying checkers in the corner . The lamplight sparkled on a nickel slot machine , close by the bar . It was a crumbling wooden building , painted yellow , and the Pacific wind squealed through the cracks . I hope you understand this is the gob talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailors as I have , you know when to keep your fingers crossed . But I believed nearly all of this one , and damn ' near cried . You do n't have to cry . You do n't even have to believe any of it . ) We were on target practice , you remember , down off San Pedro . Nearly everything in the whole Battle Fleet was there , the big wagons and the destroyers , a whole flock of cruisers , and even the old Langley . Every morning and every afternoon we let loose a few rounds from the big guns at towed targets . It took forty-four men to handle the routine in the main turrets when the guns were going , but that left space for four more to jam themselves in somehow , and those four were called the bystanders . Every day they would pick the bystanders from different sections of the ship  --  let them go up and see how the loading and firing was done . This day I am talking about they came round to my section and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Number Three turret . I carried a rating of Chief Yeoman and was detailed in the paymaster 's office on that cruise . I had five men to help me  --  my Chief Yeoman 's Mate , who went by the name of Jeff Starke , and four sailors . We had to keep a lot of accounts and do a lot of bookkeeping , but it was a good berth anyway . I said we would match to see who would be the bystander from our section , but one of the sailors put up a howl at that . He said he never had seen one of those fourteen-inch guns sound off , and he did n't intend to leave his chances to any sort of gambling game with me , after what had happened the last payday . He was a fellow named Purdie Hunter , but we called him Goldilocks on account of his yellow hair . This Hunter thought a while and said that we would have a game of skill . Whoever could kick the highest against the bulkhead in three tries would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I called off the arguments and told him to go ahead and kick , because I was sick of all the jawing . He did n't need but one kick . He put a heel mark on that bulkhead twelve inches higher than any of us could reach , and so I told him to swarm away up topside and get his belly full of gun shooting . I see him now , with those long legs of his , piling up that /adder and turning round half way to give us a loud razzberry . The turret blew about ten minutes later . I knew what it was all right . I did n't have to wait for the fumes to come down the hatchway or for the Z Emergency to sound off . You could tell from the way the ship vibrated after the detonation that it was something more than a gun firing , or even a whole broadside salvo . We hit the deck without much gab . My post in emergency was that same Number Three turret , and I had the hunch from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had gone . It was a right hunch . The deck was full of sailors , with the Exec in command and calling orders quietly . It was a thing to make everybody steady the way he called his orders . The sea was calm , and off on the starboard quarter we could see the Idaho standing by and taking our signals from the bridge . I went to my post by the turret . The door was still tight shut but we could see the black fumes seeping through , and they were had on the eyes . The Exec called out , " Get that door open , " and five or six of us jumped to it . When she swung wide the black smoke was Like a gas attack , but the wind cleared it in a minute , and we could see sailors piled up in there like fish in a market . Lying right in the door was that tall boy Hunter . It wasnatural for him to be there , seeing he had been a bystander . I reached down and caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was lucky for me then that the Exec called out , " Stand back all hands there . " I went over to the rail and in a few minutes felt some better . Now so you can understand what a spot we were in on that battle wagon , I 'll have to explain to you how a turret can blow like that . Each of those turrets serves two guns , and it is so crowded that everybody has a tough , fast time of it . Right in the middle is the hatchway leading down to the main magazine . It 's an opening about eight feet square , and the elevator comes up through it , bringing the projectiles and the powder from below . Every sailor has his job in the routine ? one particular job that he has to do just right and on the split second . The first thing that goes into the breech of a big rifle is the projectile . It comes up to the breech from the elevator on a little carriage , and the boys stationed there slide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several bags of it . Now the bags are silk , because silk burns up quickly and does n't leave any smoldering bits in the chamber of the rifle after the discharge . Those bags weigh four hundred and fifty pounds apiece , and that 's a lot of TNT . After you 've put two or three of them in behind the projectile you ease the breech shut , make your signal , and stand by for the command to fire . Now as a general rule , nobody ever can tell exactly what makes a turret blow up , because none of the eye-witnesses , so to speak , come out to give their testimony . But this time there was some evidence . There was a little ensign standing by on one of the guns , and a split second before the explosion came he dived head first down the ammunition chute . He broke a leg and an arm , but after a while they got him BRIEF ITEM IN up in the sick-bay and he told it all in about ten words . " I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw the turret captain begin his signal to fire . Then I jumped . Because I could sec that the breech was open about an inch . " You see ? As near as they could figure out afterward , about four of those big bags were lying on the carriages in the turret , all ready for the next round . They went when the backfire came , and the inside of that place , in a count of two , was just like the inside of a rifle chamber when you 've pressed the firing button . I told you about the open hatch leading down to the main magazine . I went in the turret after a few minutes , when the Exec had already looked it over , and pieces of burning rag were falling down through that open hatch as leaves fall off trees in November . They were from the other bags , and from the uniforms of the men . A crew was working down below , putting the rags out when they came down to land , but it was such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of explosive in the main magazines that none of us was having a very good time . I was working over the dead and trying to stamp out some of the burning rags when I heard them sound the signal to open the seacocks . They were going to flood everything  --  sink the ship if they had to . That was better than blowing up like a firecracker , which we might do any minute . I heard the alarm go , " Stand by to abandon ship . " It did n't take long to have her bows well down , when the water began to pour in through those seacocks . But it did n't seem to be doing much good . For all the sea that was pouring into the hull , they could n't get water up high enough to flood the magazine . The boys were still working on those drifting bits of fiery rag that seemed to keep coming down as fast as they were put out . They started getting out the lifeboats , and we could see them getting out the lifeboats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole fleet had quit steaming and everything was standing round waiting for us to make one big sound and then just not be there any more . I went below to my quarters . When you abandon ship like that everybody has to take something with him . Somebody is supposed to take care of the instruments , for example . Somebody else is told off to take the Captain 's files , and the Exec 's files  --  all the records . Down in my quarters Starke and I started packing a suitcase full of the payroll records , the ledgers and bales of paper that go with that job . There was a big lot of stuff , and we were stowing it away pretty fast when I noticed that Starke had quit working and was looking at me sort of funny . I said to him , " What the hell ? If she blows she blows . Hold your breakfast , sailor . " But he kept looking at me . I thought he was jumpy about the blow-off we expected any minute , because that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a low sort of voice , " You going to open the safe ? " did n't say anything . I knew by now what was in his head . There was about two hundred thousand dollars in the safe , in currency . More than that . Starke said , " There 's going to be a lot of excitement when we clear away in the boats . We 're going to be sorry as hell that we forgot all this money and let it sink to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean . We 're going to tell them how sorry we are and then quit answering questions . " I said , " If only she do n't blow up , maybe we could get away with it . " " Get the safe open , " he said . I got the safe open and there were f the little packages of money , just like I had counted them out and put the little paper bands around them . Starke reached past me and grabbed a handful and started packing them in a little black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stow in our clothes , and anyway that would have been a give-away if anything went wrong and they nailed us . In the bag , that way , we could always back down and say we were bringing it off with the rest of the paymaster 's stuff . I said , " They wo n't pay any attention when we climb aboard the Idaho . " He said , " We can hide it some place when we get aboard there . " We could feel the water pouring into the ship . The bows were so far down now that the floor of our quarters was on a steep slant . We could hear men yelling all up and down our deck  --  not excited , you understand , but just making everything clear to abandon ship , and sitting sort of nervous with all that fire and high explosive so close together . When we had got all the money packed in the little bag we went ahead and finished stowing the records in the suitcase . I said , " If they try to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Sure , " he said . " My hitch is up in another month anyway . I can stall until then . " " With that much jack , " I told him , " even a fool could get away safe . I 'm heading for Mexico the first time there ai n't anybody looking . " We did n't talk much after that . All the time the ship was going deeper and deeper in the bows . I went over and stood by the garbage chute for a minute and there were n't six inches of daylight between the end of the chute and the sea . The water was boiling up from under the hull as we settled . The deck was heaved over to such an angle we could hardly stand up . The junior officers were shouting orders down the hatchways , but I went over to that little bag and opened it up and just stood there for a minute or two , looking at all that money , picking it up in my hands  --  twenties and tens and fives  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich as Rockefeller . I thought of the things I was going to buy , and I can remember I sort of prayed  --  you know  --  Jesus , do n't let that magazine blow now  --  not now ! I thought about all the broads in the whole world , and every single one of them having plenty of time for me . I thought about the things I would get for them , diamond rings and necklaces and red dresses and shoes made out of snakeskin , buying everything that any of them ever had a notion for . Starke must have been thinking about the same thing because I saw him looking hard at the money . But all he said was , over and over again , " My God , boy ! My God , my God ! " We did n't dispute who was going to carry it . There was n't any need of that . He could carry it , and he knew better than to try anything . He knew me pretty well . A sailor came up and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . " He did n't see the money because I dropped the lid of the bag . I said to Starke , looking hard at him , " You take care of it , Mate . " He nodded his head . The sailor asked me whether I thought the ship was going to blow up before we could get off , but I did n't pay any attention to him . When I got up on deck it suddenly came to me that I had n't thought about those dead sailors for a long time . But they had them in sheets by now , and I said to myself that there was n't any use getting soft in the throat about a lot of sailors that were dead and gone anyway . Still , I could n't help feeling sort of thankful to them . You know what I mean . One poor gob there had made a mistake about that breech-lock , and the turret had gone . Just like that , and he had made a millionaire out of a dumb Chief Yeoman . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , but what the hell ? That was n't my fault , was its I did n't do it . It was just a sort of fate , knocking off forty-eight dumb sailors so that two dumb sailors could get rich . Somebody always has to suffer , and if that was the way this fate business worked out , well , did I have anything to do with it ? It was easy enough to get my mind off of those fellows , with that ship likely to blow apart any minute , and with all those greenbacks , piled up one on top of another , all belonging to me . The Tennessee was off the port bow , getting down her boats . Three or four destroyers were running around us like terrier dogs around a hurt bear , speaking us through their trumpets and getting our calls back . Then they nailed me . They nailed me tight down to the deck so I could n't move one foot , could n't lift a foot or a hand or even take a breath . They called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge of the magazines came running up to the Captain and said , " All under control now , sir . All fires extinguished . " And the Old Man shouted , " Close the seacocks . " When I could move , after a minute or two , I dropped below decks to where Starke was coming out of our quarters , a gob carrying the suitcases and himself with the black bag under his folded-up peajacket . I said , " The bastards have crossed us . " He just looked at me . I said , " They 're not going to let her go down . They 're saving the ship . " Starke turned black . I guess I was looking black too . He said , " Don'ttry to be funny , Mate . I do n't like it . " I said , " I told you , did n't I ? " He turned around and went back to the safe and told the gob to put the suitcases down and get out . He looked at me . " The bastards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the names for a minute or two . We looked at the money , and threw it back in the safe a bundle at a time throwing it hard enough to break the paper wrappers and spread the money in a jumbled pile . Starke kept saying , " It 's my money , the rats . Taking it away from you when it 's already yours . " I said , " It 's our , money . They 're a lot of god damn ' thieves . " A gob came through . He was looking silly , like he 'd had a drink . He said , " Yowl Ai n't it great they 're saving the old tub ? I 'd be losing a home if this wagon went down . " Starke slogged him in the mouth and slid him away down the deck , which was still slanting at a steep angle . After a while we had to go up topside again and we took a look at the forty-eight bodies all lying out in a long row . I felt a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sore at them , but dumb or not , I was sore . They started the whole business by fouling a load routine . They put me in the money and then , like it was a good joke to somebody , they snatched the money back again . When my hitch was done I lashed up and cast off . No more Navy for me after that . Starke left before I did but he did n't even bother to come around and say so long . The thing left him kind of bitter and he acted like every man in seagoing clothes was his enemy . I never have heard of him since . Maybe you understand now why I said it was n't the forty-eight that had the tough luck , but me . And maybe you understand why even a dump like this is better than the Navy after the break I got . Have one on the house .
