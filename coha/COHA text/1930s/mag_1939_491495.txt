T HE world was blind one hundred years ago . It saw with its eyes , but no one saw more than his own two eyes registered al first hand , and no longer than the image remained on his ret- ina . If a famous man or a famous scene had not been painted at the time , no one who came after could know what the man or scene looked like . Only memory told a son how his mother had looked once , or brought back her baby to the mother . One hundred years ago next Monday , the discovery of photography was announced to the French Academy of Sciences , the joint work of Daguerre and Niepce . Later that year Daguerre turned over the rights and details to the French Government  --  Niepce ( Continued an Para 52 ) // Continued from Page 50 ) comes from free enterprise . Government did not create it , government did not invent and learn to manage the intricate social mechanisms by which it operates . What is wrong with these mechanisms ? Have they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the telephone stopped working , the electric light failed , the streetcar stalled , have the trains ceased to run and the airplanes to fly , are the stores closed and the movies dark and the radio silent ? Where is the basis for this astonishing statement that , because these mechanisms are complex , they must . be seized by force and operated by politicians ? Is all this delicate complexity of interwoven social services which comes pulsing with life from the minds and hands of millions of workers , this complexity which is changing as constantly as life , to have its imperfections mended with a sledge hammer because it is complex ? Government is force ; its symbol is the army , upon which ultimately its existence rests . Force is necessary only to punish wrongdoing ; the good man needs no government , the wholly good society would need none . By its nature , force is simple ; where it is used , it destroys complexity . Force ruled society for millenniums , and kept life simple . The American revolution released society from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place and function as the minor , necessary minimum of force in human affairs . Men who want efficient justice substitute the policeman and the judge for the mob lynching ; free society delegates to government the society 's authority to punish the very small minority of mon whose acts are an evil to society . Complexity is not an evil ; it is the marvelous product of a free society . The sum of free individual energies in action is in finitelyerea five and therefore increasingly complex . The general good that men desire can be achieved only by these free energies , since there is no other creative energy in the human world . To stop the creative processes of freedom in society by destroying that freedom is obviously not the remedy for errors and failures . This declaration that government must reduce society to order is of course the military statement of dictators the world over . Force has that point of view . The autocrat commands , and the thing is done . But what thing ? Is it ever a new thing ? Can it ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Men know only what is past , even though they be autocrats . Invariably , therefore , government decrees that what has been , shall be . Government establishes order , and order is the death of creation , for creation is a constant disorder progressing from the simple to the increasingly complex , from the imperfect toward an . everretrea ting perfection . A free society creates the increasingly complex means of dealing with its increasingly complex world . It transforms the condescending lady who visited the poor into settlement houses , medical clinics , Associated Charities , Community Chests , the Red Cross , the Salvation Army , innumerable other agencies . America proliferates humanitarian , fraternal , co-operative and mutual groups of all kinds , for all purposes , constantly , in multiplying abun dance . Forget these European ideas foreign to America , discard phrases meaningless here ; look at America , and whatever social good you dream of , you will find in this country the bud of a social agency for accomplishing it . Often you find the agency full-grown , idle , neglected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freedom created even the ideas of equality , justice , humanity in human relationships . These ideas are inseparable from the long revolt against government that began when Abram left Ur , and that found its first effective method in our American revolution . This revolution must invent its means of creating the good society ; history does not help i t here ; it is breaking new ground . The means are not simple ; they must be as complex as the modern world . America is producing an infinity of experiments . Everywhere , new social mechanisms created in this country meet the candid eye ; mutual banking , insurance , countless methods of profit sharing and of ownership distribution , farmers ' and consumers ' co-operatives , innumerable forms of labor-management relationships , of community action , of free association for mutual aid . The complexity of this society is the hope of the world , and the imperative reason why it must not be reduced by government to a disciplined and simple order . The reactionary 's methods are stale with repetition : history records their results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread and circuses , until it taxed the workers out of jobs and the farmers off the farms . Kaiser Wilhelm taxed the Germans to give them old-age pensions and socialized agriculture by decree . Louis XIV stopped Missouri 's wine production to protect the vintners of Bordeaux from unfair competition , and the Spanish government enforced its ideas of the just treatment of labor in the Mississippi Valley before the American revolution began . The American revolution goes forward , on a new principle , toward a new world . The Constitution was a strategic retreat . The revolution must not only hold that line against attack but go forward from it . Rather than permit government to invade society , the free society must invade government . This invasion is a revolutionary necessity , which liberals will someday perceive and act upon . This century of experiment proves that a free society creates the instruments for further reducing governing power . Our revolutionary method is division of governing power . There is nothing sacred in the tripartite division ; government can be divided into any number of parts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by freedom governs itself independently of political government ; free society can govern itself as a functional part of constitutional government , thus reducing the power of executive and legislative , and increasing the checks and balances within the governmental structure . A free society will one day learn to use its new instruments of aggression against government , for the long fight for freedom will not end as long as men are human . The American revolution continues . A love of liberty and of free ways and humane ways of life in a classless society is today the strongest force in this people . 66 OTO MY EEO 99 Con rimed from Page 8 ) had died six years earlier  --  and was given an annuity of 6000 francs and made an officer of the Legion of Honor in return . France gave the process to the world . Other men had been groping toward photography , but Daguerre and Niepce were the first to make a permanent image . In the best of light , three hours ' exposure was necessary . When the news reached America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great artist of the camera , was a sixteen-year-old boy in New York . The only agreed fact about Brady 's birth and youth is that his father was an Irishman . The usually accurate American Dictionary of Biography says that he was born in Warren County , New York ; that nothing is known of his mother and that his early youth is a blank . Brady seems not to have known what his middle initial stood for . But at Saratoga he comes out of the fog about 1838 to meet William Page , a portrait painter , who encouraged him to draw , and introduced him to S. F. B. Morse , inventor of the telegraph . Morse had been a painter first , and had met Daguerre in Paris . He and Prof. J. W. Draper were the first on this side of the sea to experiment with Daguerre 's discovery . Young Brady appears to have worked with Morse . Daguerre and others improved the process rapidly and , by the summer of 1841 , daguerreotypes were being made commercially in every American city , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of amateurs . Brady opened his portrait studio at . Broadway and Fulton , New York , in 1842 or 1843 . Though far from the first , it quickly became the famous one . Brady photographed every American President from John Quincy Adams to McKinley , excepting only William Henry Harrison , who died a month after taking office , and before the Brady studio began business . Though Andrew Jackson died soon after the opening of the studio , Brady already had sent an operator to Nashville to pose Old Hickory at the Hermitage . To begin with , Brady sought out every celebrity . Later they sought out him ; to sit for him was a social distinction . He took most of the medals awarded . He introduced tinted daguerreotypes on ivory , and Bret Harte sang : Well , yes  --  if you saw us out driving Each day in the park , four-in-hand  --  If you saw poor dear mania contriving To look supernaturally grand  --  If you saw papa 's picture US taken By Brady , and tinted al that You 'd never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1855 Brady brought over from England Alexander Gardner , an expert in the wet-plate process invented by Scott-Archer , and soon discarded the daguerreotype for the photograph . He opened a branch studio in Washington in 1859 , a second New York studio farther uptown in 1859 . The public bought prints of celebrities from him as fans now collect " stills " of the princes and princesses of Hollywood . When the Civil War began , Brady foresaw , not the news picture but the opportunity to record a war photographically for the first time . The reproduction of photographs in print still was a slow and expensive process . Harper 's and Leslie 's weeklies recorded the war in line drawings made by staff illustrators in the field . Brady plagued Lincoln and Allan Pinkerton , head of the secret service , until they gave him permission to go where he pleased , photographing battle and camp . At his own expense , of course . Like everyone else , he supposed it would be a brief war . He was in the thick of first . Bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tails of his white linen duster streaming behind . The New York Fire Zouaves , seeing him unarmed , gave him a broadsword . He strapped it about his waist , and when he turned up , afoot and bedraggled , in Washington , three days later , the sword still was there . He and his men were with the armies through 1861 and 1862 , each unit carrying several hundred 8-by-10 glass plates in dustproof boxes , and all the chemicals needed to prepare them in a converted delivery wagon which the soldiers called a " What-is-it ? " Confederate artillery searched these wagons out , fearing them to be some newfangled Yankee gun . The wagon included a dark room . The cost was so great that Brady seems to have gone back to New York late in 1862 and not returned to the army until Grant 's final campaign . He was not at Appomattox , nor , unfortunately , was any other of the many photographers with the armies . The greatest picture of all never was taken . Brady had spent $100,000 , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the panic of 1873 . His suppliers seized many of his plates for debt . In 1875 the Government bought a set of 2000 war scenes for $25,000 , since stored in the War College , and Brady got back a fourth of what he had spent . With this money , he reopened a studio in Washington , but now he was only one of many . Fashion had other whims . His health went with his prestige and his money . In 1895 he was run over by a wagon in Washington and never worked again . Friends cared for him until he died in 1896 . His plates became widely scattered . All of the daguerreotypes and photographs shown here came to M. TUrese Bonney from the Brady family , and only one is believed to have been published previously . Many of his negatives have been lost or destroyed , others damaged beyond restoration , and the identification of those which remain sometimes is a task . If the subjects are not readily recognizable , they must be traced through Brady 's daily register of sittings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary photographs of battle , prison , camp , armies on the march , soldiers , leaders and camp followers had been almost forgotten wffen , ou the fiftieth anniversary of the war , these and the pictures of other Army photographers were published in a ten-volume set . Their cameras were clumsily heavy and inflexible , the shutter speed slow . The plates had to be coated in the dark by an involved chemical process . The least breath reaching the collodion would produce a blank spot . These plates had to be used within five to ten minutes and developed within five minutes of exposure . Brady and hii helpers took two negatives of each scene as a precaution against breakage . Now Brady is remembered for these , and it is forgotten that for twenty years previously he had been the great and fashionable studio photographer of America . He , himself , made only a fraction of the plates credited to him . Both in the studio and in the war , his staff did most of the actual photography . An artist with the camera , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , but he was a great organizer and his was the vision . The best account of his work , and the best history of American photography , is the recently published and expensive Photography and the American Scene , by Robert Taft , professor of chemistry at the University of Kansas . Compare these portraits , whether by Brady or his anonymous cameramen , with the best of today , then doff your hat to a master and his men . 1 . The Washington Government kept her a prisoner for nine months and she wrote the most indignant book , probably , ever penned . Ludicrously indignant , for she boasted of a dozen acts for which any government in war would have been justified in hanging her . In prison , closely watched , she continued to get and transmit important information to the South , until the frantic Federal Government presented her to Jefferson Davis , virtually with its compliments . Her information won the opening battle for the South , according to her statements , and this claim is plausible . Jefferson Davis told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been no battle of Bull Run .

If you would understand the temper of 1861 , read her book , My Imprisonment and the First Year of Abolition Rule at Washington . Then read William Lloyd Garrison or Wendell Phillips . She hated and despised the Abolitionist as the Abolitionist hated and despised the slave owner . Her hatred came to take in everything Northern . A Petticoat Victory Her name was Rose O'Neil Green-how . She was a Marylander and the widow of Robert Greenhow , a Virginian . He had been a translator for the State Department , then law officer for the U. S. Land Commission in California , where he died of a fall in 1854 . In Washington , John C. Calhoun often had lived with the Greenhows , and the wife was a passionate admirer of the Southern leader and his political faith .

The next day she got back from Thomas Jordan , Beanregard 's adjutant general , a note reading : " We rely upon you for precise information . " That day she was able to inform . Jordan by messenger that McDowell planned to cut the Winchester Railroad to prevent Johnston from combining with Beauregard . It was Johnston 's timely arrival which turned first Bull Run from a Southern defeat into a Union rout . Mrs. Greenhow had gone to New York to see a relative off to California , and she heard the news there , with a. satisfaction she hardly could contain . When she got hack to Washington on the twenty-third , she found a message from Jordan reading : " Our President and our General direct me to thank you .

Stranger Than Fiction She is indignant that Lincoln should have slipped into Washington clandestinely for his inauguration , to evade the plot to kill or capture him . She sneers that he came disguised in " a Scotch cap and cloak , " and quotes him as saying : " Hillo ! Just look at me . By jingo , my own dad would n't know me . " She personifies Satan as Lincoln , when she is not disdaining the President as a frontier oaf .

Despite this , she wrote long and stern letters to Seward and the provost marshal , lecturing them on the outrage of violating her civil rights . On January 18 , 1862 , aware that they had failed to stop her from communicating with the enemy , the Government transferred her to old Capitol Prison , whore Congress once had met and // Calhoun had died . She told Lieutenant Wood , in charge there , " You have got one of the hardest little rebels here that you ever saw . " She was too modest .

Her point of view was that Lincoln 's Government was the work of the devil , and to flout and defeat it was the sacred duty of any right-minded person . On May twenty-sixth . Jeffers-on Davis , apparently referring to Ibis indignity , wrote her from Richmond : " I have been made acquainted with another of the many bitter trials to which your free spirit was subjected while your person was in the power of a vulgar despotism .

It was published in London in 1863 . You will look in vain for Mrs. Greenhow in the reference books . The inclusive American Dictionary of Biography devotes many lines to her husband , a much less important and interesting figure historically , and mentions her only as his wife . Twist of Fate Soon after the publication of her book , she sailed from England on a Confederate blockade runner and was drowned off the North Carolina coast in attempting to land . She was buried in Wilmington . Her monument , erected by the Daughters of the Confederacy , describes her as " a bearer of despatches to the Confederate Government .

There is no more pitiful figure in modern history than the Empress Carlotta , whom tragedy drove mad when still in her twenties . For another sixty years she lived , totally insane and se-eluded , in a Belgian ch  --  teau , imagining herself still Empress of Mexico . She was the seventeen-year-old daughter of Leopold 1 , King of the Belgians , when the Hapsburg Archduke Maximilian , brother of the Austrian emperor , Franz Joseph , married her in 1857 . They were a handsome and a happy couple ; he a likable , if ineffectual , man . They were living idyllically in the beautiful castle of Miramar , near Trieste , when Napoleon III 's ambitions entrapped them .

Franz Joseph tried earnestly to dissuade him . When the younger brother persisted , Franz Joseph forced him to forswear all his Austrian rights . The moment the American Civil War ended , we prepared to march a veteran army under Sherman across the Rio Grande to enforce the Monroe Doctrine . Napoleon III called his army home quickly . Carlotta had rushed to Europe to beg Napoleon not to abandon them . Failing at Paris , she hurried to Rome to plead with the Pope to intervene . Maximilian remained in Mexico , quixotically loyal to his followers and a hopeless cause . Captured at Quer-Mar ? , he was executed by a firing squad of Juarez 's revolutionaries on June 19 , 1867 . When the news reached Europe , his Empress ' grief destroyed her mind . The world had forgotten her until the Germans marched through Belgium in 1914 . They did not disturb the by then Seventy-four-year-old madwoman in her ch  --  teau . She lived until just the other day  --  January 19 , 1927. 3 . " Mrs. Tihbitts , " and nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But her bifurcated dress suggests strongly that she was an early disciple of Dr. Mary Walker , crusader for women 's rights , who outraged the nineteenth century by including trousers among those rights . Mary Walker was one of the first women in America to win a medical degree , against a strong prejudice of the time . It was a stronger prejudice she affronted when she put aside skirts for these baggy zouave trousers , partly concealed by this long flapping coat . She and her followers became a stock comic-paper jest . Ministers and other sober men denounced her , lewder men jeered , small boys threw bad eggs , and her own sex scorned her . For all her eccentricities , she was a fine and kindly soul . She practiced medicine in Columbus , Ohio , with few patients . When the war began , she became a contract surgeon with the Fifty-second Ohio Infantry , but appears to have served principally as a spy . In the Army , she wore the regulation uniform , except that her jacket was cut like a blouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lecturing widely , she wore a frock coat and striped trousers by day , full evening dress on the platform , with her hair in curls .

When the Prince of Wales , forty years later to become Edward VII , bearded and portly , visited Canada and the United States in 1860 , he was told in London that one of the " things to do " in New York was to have his photograph made by the great Brady . The prince traveled as " Lord Renfrew , " slept in the White House , danced with every American belle , as his grandson , another Edward , Prince of Wales , did sixty years later . He was nineteen , unmarried , still in Cambridge , and the second monarch or future monarch to come to America . Louis Philippe had been a refugee here in the 1790's. 5 . If Braxton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave Shelbyville , Tennessee , in such a hurry in June , 1863 , they might have stopped to hang Pauline Cushman . She had been tried by court-martial and sentenced to die as a spy within ten days . The Spy of the Cumberland Rosecrans and his Union Army of the Cumberland had deported her ostentatiously from Nashville as a supposed Southern sympathizer . Actually , she was his commissioned secret agent . She had been born in New Orleans , but was taken as a child by her father to live in Grand Rapids , Michigan . When she was eighteen , she left home , made her way to New York , went on the stage and returned to New Orleans . The Washington Government had employed her first in the hunt for Southern spies and sympathizers in Louisville , then in Nashville . Knowing the South well , speaking with its accent , she found the Army of Tennessee much easier than had Rosecrans . Laden with Bragg 's maps , she was stopped by a patrol at Tullahoma , not far from his headquarters . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , she would have been passed . But her uneasy knowledge led her to make an incriminating effort to escape . She collapsed from terror and the accumulated strain , and the courtly Southrons removed her to a hospital at Shelbyville . There she was left behind when the Confederates retreated hastily . Her spying days were over , for everyone in both armies now knew her for what she was . Rosecrans ' men called her major and she wore the insignia of that rank . She went North to be commended by Lincoln and to be feted as the " spy of the Cumberland . " Then she returned to the stage and took to the lecture platform , too , competing with Belle Boyd , and lecturing in a Federal uniform . Gradually she slipped downward until she killed herself in San Francisco in 1893 , where the G. A. R. buried her in their plot with a semimilitary funeral . 6 . Brady , his wife and sister . 7 .

James had wanted to be a printer , ever after reading Franklin 's Autobiography , and John had followed him into apprenticeship . The two other brothers , Joseph Wesley and Fletcher , bought into the growing business later . The four worked like a team , each with special abilities which supplemented those of his brothers . " Either one is the Harper , the rest are the Brothers , " said James . When Nicholas Nickleby was published in 1839 , with its amiable Cheeryble brothers , the name was applied to the IIarpers . By 1850 , when Harper 's Monthly was launched . the house of Harper was supreme in the book field . Harper 's Weekly was founded in 1857 , Harpers ' Bazar in 1867 , and each led its field .

That the guests were assembled in Springfield on New Year 's Day , 1841. for the wedding of Mary Todd and Abraham Lincoln , the wedding feast hr prepared , and that Lincoln failed to appear , is well known . Nearly two years later they were married in the same parlor . A scene in Robert Sherwood 's current play , Abe Lincoln in Illinois , shows Lincoln in his law office on the day set for his wedding , when he mildly announces his intention of not showing u p and as mildly ignores the remonstrances of his friends . That Mary Todd forgave this ptiblie humiliation is hard to reconcile with her character . She was self-satisfied , hot-tempered , stingingly sarcastic . She was the daughter of the president of the Bank of Kentucky , great-granddaughter of a Revolutionary major general , and she took her family very seriously . She had been educated in a private school where only French was spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courted by many , including Stephen A.

Her contemporaries had little pleasant to say about Mary Todd Lincoln , but she must have detected something of greatness in Lincoln to have chosen him . Lincoln 's Wedding Day Choose him she did . Lincoln went gracelessly enough to his second engagement at the altar . As he dressed in his room in William Butler 's house , the latter 's small son , Speed , seeing their boarder so unusually attired , asked , in innocence , where he was going . " To hell , I suppose , " the thirty-three-yearold bridegroom told him gloomily . The Lincoln-Todd marriage was probably the first ever performed in Springfield with the full Episcopal ceremony .

Only four descendants of Abraham and Mary Lincoln live  --  one granddaughter and three great-grandchildren . Mrs. Robert Randolph , of Washington , D. C. , is the granddaughter. 9 . You have to take Belle Boyd 's word for most of her exploits as a spy in behalf of the South , though we do know that Stonewall Jackson said to her at Front Royal : " I thank you for myself and for the army for the immense services you have rendered your country today .

He dying shortly afterward , she went on the stage in England to capitalize the notoriety which followed publication there of her book . With an English success back of her , she returned to America and played the nation . When she ceased to draw as an actress , she took up lecturing . She died in Kilbourne , Wisconsin , in 1900 , as she was about to lecture there . Brady 's photograph , undated , appears to have been made after her return from England .

Beecher 's Famous Children 12 . Lyman Beecher had reason to be proud of the daughter on his right and the son on his left . No other father of the first half of the nineteenth century had two such famous children as had he in Harriet Beecher Stowe and Henry Ward Beecher . Of Lyman 's nine children by his first wife , all were persons , but these were his jewels . Henry was the most famous and influential man ever to occupy an American pulpit . Unconventional , audacious , witty , natural , friendly , picturesque of speech , emotional , dramatic , only Lincoln andHorace Greeley rivaled him in influence on American thought .
