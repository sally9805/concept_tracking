To the pimento sands and mint-jelly sea of Bermuda last week air tourists flew for the first time as Pan American and Imperial Airways simultanteously began passenger service from Port Washington , L.I . with one plane apiece each way per week. + This week Imperial was scheduled to send a flying boat on first test hops all the way across the Atlantic between the new airbases at Botwood , Newfoundland and Foynes , Ireland ( TIME , Nov. 30 ; March 1 ) . <P> An association similar to that of Pan American and Imperial but as unstable as an alliance between cat and dog was formed last week between Germany 's Lufthansa and Air France . These two national airlines agreed to cooperate in test flights across the Atlantic , share each other 's bases at each end . The agreement gives Germany rights at Dakar , Senegal , for South Atlantic flights , and at Hanoi . French Indo-China , for Far Eastern flying . France won the right to use Germany 's catapult ships in the Atlantic . Co-operation was necessary because France lacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to land in the Azores , Bermuda , Canada or the U. S. <P> Last week Air France and the French Line joined in creating a new concern called Companie Air France-Transatlantique . It announced that the lumbering old flying boat Lieutenant de Vaisseau Paris , which capsized in Pensacola Bay 18 months ago after flying up from South America , had been rebuilt , would soon start test flights across the North Atlantic . Lufthansa last week announced that it would start test flights to the U. S. in the first week of July with " the two biggest two-float hydroplanes ever constructed . " These trim monoplanes , called Nordmeer and Nordwind , are powered by four Diesel engines apiece , have a cruising speed of 155 m.p.h . Designed for mail only , they will be catapulted by German ships at each end as were the two Lufthansa planes which test-flew the Atlantic last summer ( TIME , Sept. 21 ) . Last week the U. S. gave Lufthansa permission to make more tests . Neither Lufthansa nor Air France has permission to inaugurate commercial service . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying boats with similar speed and weight , but the Pan American Bermuda Clipper carries 28 passengers to the Imperial Cavalier 's 16 . The run takes 5 hr . The Clipper leaves Long Island every Thursday , returns Sunday . The Cavalier leaves Long Island Saturday , returns Wednesday . Airmail is carried from Bermuda in the Cavalier . No airmail can be carried to Bermuda because the U. S. Post Office has not awarded a contract .
