Walter Biggar is a thin-faced Scot . He owns a large farm near Dalbeattie , Scotland . He usually dresses in brown . He always carries a cane . He is reputed to be one of the world 's best judges of fine cattle . Every year for the past eight he has taken a trip to the U. S. to decide which steer should be named Grand Champion at the International Live Stock Exposition in Chicago . <P> Last week , at the 33rd annual Exposition , Judge Biggar was in his customary place at the centre of the arena at the Union Stock Yards . Things looked pretty much as usual . There were the familiar signs-THIS SHOW HAS BEEN DISINFECTED ; the familiar sights &; sounds-miles of red bunting , polo players in bright blue hats , stolid farmers ' boys in overalls , svelte geldings , grunting swine , bleating sheep , sleepy steers annoyed at constant currying . Judge Biggar saw familiar faces among the exhibitors-23 year-old Elliott Brown of Rose Hill , Iowa , to whose steer he had awarded the grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutchess County . N. Y. , to whom he had awarded the prize last year and who had with him Grandson Oakleigh Thorne II , now a young gentle man farmer . <P> Before the week was out Judge Biggar who speaks with only a slight burr , had something new to talk about . For the last two seasons large Hereford breeders of the West , preferring to show at the Los Angeles exhibit , had brought few of their white-faced stock to Chicago . For the last five years Judge Biggar had not seen fit to award a grand prize to a Hereford . And neither he nor his predecessors had ever seen fit to award the prize to any steer from Texas , greatest cattle raising State . <P> The arena was crowded as Judge Biggar watched beef on the hoof waddle by . Among the 750 was many a Hereford , returned to prominence . Finally the Biggar cane , at last removed from the Biggar arm pointed to a sleek fat Hereford from Texas , named Texas Special . Owner William Largent of Merkel , Tex. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grand Champion Texas Special was put on the auction block , in dispirited bidding was sold to Pfaelzer Packing Co. for $1,676.25-$1.25 a lb. , lowest price since 1923 when Broadus White Socks brought but 60 a lb. * Before being cut up , Texas Special was taken to Pittsburgh , exhibited some more . <P> Will Largent 's steer was not the only Hereford to receive the canny favor of Judge Biggar last week . For reserve ( second place ) champion he chose Aster Domino , owned by Wyoming Hereford Ranch of Cheyenne ; for best herd he chose a group of Herefords shown by the Oklahoma A. &; M. College ( Stillwater , Okla . ) . <P> No judge of human animals , Judge Biggar had no hand in the selection of Healthiest Boy and Healthiest Girl . A committee of physicians &; nurses gave first honors to Dorothy Eiler , 16 , of Aitkin County , Minn. , who likes to dance , keeps her nails trimmed , has fillings in her teeth ( score : 98.6 ) ; Ross Allen , 20. of Salem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a doctor , milks cows every day , plays baseball ( score : 99.4 ) .
