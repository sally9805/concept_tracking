What began last fortnight as Spain 's least bloody election in years was swelling last week into horrid crescendos of threatened social upheaval , secession and civil war . Overnight 30,000 political prisoners came bustling out of jail . They included the furious Catalonian secessionist , " President " Luis Companys , who had just begun to serve a 30-year stretch in a grim Andalusian prison for having proclaimed the industrial northeast of Spain the independent Republic of Catalonia ( TIME , Oct. 15 , 1934 ) . Out of jail popped most of this suppressed Republic 's Parliament and met in Barcelona , their capital . In Madrid more or less delirious Spanish mobsters and political ex-convicts paraded around , brandishing plain red flags , singing the Internationale and shouting vaguely " Long Live Russia ! " <P> Every train to the French frontier was jammed with taut-faced people . " Who are they ? " a correspondent asked a station official at the frontier . " Dukes , marquises and millionaires ! " replied the station official correctly . <P> Even that notorious dastard and Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in any part of Spain with 1,000 peseta notes , bolted like a rabbit for France until things should quiet down . A few weeks ago brazen Juan March was offering publicly to highest bidders the Governorship of a Spanish province and all its seats in the Cortes , which he claimed to control . Last week Dastard March and the blameless Duquesa de Fernn Nez were about equally scared . The Duchess stripped off her great rope of pearls , left it with Spanish frontier guards " for safe keeping , " because otherwise they obstinately refused to permit Her Grace to flee to France . <P> All this was the more shocking because a study of the election returns , when all ballots had been finally counted , forced Madrid correspondents to cable that the election was a draw . Spanish party coalition lines are so loosely drawn that , although the " Left " appeared to have won 253 seats , and the " Right " 220 , there was no assurance that a vote of confidence could be won by the bilious Left Republican who suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The President of the Republic , uneasy old Don Niceto Alcla Zamora , was not in the least sure that the unexpected ballot victory of the Left might not enflame the Right 's scheming would-be Dictator , Don Jose Maria Gil Robles , to attempt a coup d'etat . <P> Amid the tense , confused situation in Madrid an ominous reality loomed in the fact that Communists and Socialists had pooled their votes , their voices and their actions in Spain . This was in accordance with the new " united front policy " adopted last year in Moscow by the Comintern or United Communist Parties of the World , on the shrewd instruction of Joseph Stalin ( TIME , Aug. 5 et seq . ) . Intimidation , not votes , was the force which actually opened Spain 's jails last week and spewed out 30,000 " politicals. "
