txt Fritz Roethke , 17 years old , cabin boy and sole survivor of the forty hands who were aboard the Hamburg-American motorship Isis which foundered and sank some 200 miles off Land 's End , England , tonight related the grim story of the vessel 's loss . The youth , who spent twelve hours in an open boat in which he crouched in terror in the darkness before he was picked up by the steamer Westernland , told his story haltingly to the commander of the rescue ship who relayed it here . Tells What Happened . " At 6 p. in . Sunday we were all mustered on the boat deck when No. 1 hatch was smashed in and the sea entered , " the cabin boy said . " The captain shouted above the storm and said if bulkhead No. 2 would hold out we could keep afloat until morning . " At 8 p. in. a big breaker came over the ship and apparently bulkhead No. 2 gave way , causing a heavy list to port with the boat deck one foot above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The captain shouted to the chief officer to launch boat No. 2 . Some shipmates and I went into the boat whenbang  --  another breaker struck , smashing the boat completely . Stern Straight Up in Air . " I found myself in the water , and struggling , I saw the fore of the ship completely submerged . The stern of the Isis was almost straight up in the air when next I saw her . Down it went , slowly . " I was awfully scared . I saw my mates spill off into the water . I heard their calls for help , which gradually died away until only the gate roared . Then all was , black and lonely . " Then , atop a big wave , I saw an upturned boat and made for . it es best I , could . ' Upon reaching . it I found another mate clinging to it Another ' breaker turned the boat right side up and I was able to scramble into it . " I saw the other 's hold loosen and he was swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the bottom of the boat , which was full of water and continually awash . " Hours and hours , it seemed , I held on . Up and down the waves tossed me . " Then I saw a ship . I waved a hand and the next thing I remember I found myself in the . Westerniand 's hospital . " Passengers on the Queen Mary , whose - course was altered in answer to the Isis ' first SOS , spent an uncomfortable night in the heavy seas . At least 18- were reported injured .
