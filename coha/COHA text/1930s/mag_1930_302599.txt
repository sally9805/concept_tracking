Members of the Fordham University football team last week eyed with disgust Rameses IV , a large untidy ram . Three weeks ago Mascot Rameses III , who had brought victory to the team for two seasons , was worried to death by mongrel dogs . Immediately a delegation was sent to a New Jersey slaughter house to pick a fit successor , for Fordham 's game with St. Mary 's College . The delegation surveyed all rams with care , picked as Rameses IV one whose tough , untidy appearance made him particularly lucky looking . Fortnight ago at the St. Mary's-Fordham game , Rameses IV stood on the side lines , looked as tough as possible . But Fordham lost-her first defeat in two years . Rameses IV was sent back to the slaughter house .
