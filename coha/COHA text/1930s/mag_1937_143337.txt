U. S. ski enthusiasts , eagerly sniffing the chill autumn air for snow last week , suddenly found a healthy January blizzard raging in their samovar . For Emile Allais , who last February at Chamonix won the International Ski Federation 's World Championship by taking firsts in the slalom and downhill races , laid down a new and highly controversial rule for skiing . All skiing turns should be abandoned , said Champion Allais , excepting the pure Christiania and the parallel Christiania . The French Ski Federation heartily concurred with its champion and , when his Le Ski Franais was published last week at Bellegarde , a small town in France , the Federation promptly adopted it as the official method of teaching Frenchmen to ski . <P> This is nothing short of revolution in ski technique , for the first things U. S. ski masters teach neophytes are the stem turn and the stem-Christiania , executed by braking with one ski , then edging the other over . Pure " Christies " ( now learned after stemming is mastered ) involve no stemming , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrusting one ski forward . They are more graceful and faster than stem turns , or the other great ski maneuver-the Telemark. * <P> Ski masters in the U. S. shook their heads over this hasty French abandonment of a 20-year-old tried-and-true technique , doubting whether better skiers could be produced by limiting their repertoire of ski-maneuvers . <P> <P> *Originally the orthodox ski technique , Telemark turns ( accomplished by sliding one ski far forward so that it guides the other into the turn ) are practical only in deep snow , lost favor when the Christiania technique was developed .
