THE ROMANTIC MAN A STORY BY MARY HEATON VORSE p EOPLE were always wondering what a brilliant scientist like Paul Hammersmark could see in his pretty little wife . A year after their marriage they were still wondering . " The matter with you , " his friend Stillman told him , " is that your paternal and sex instincts got crossed when you married Rita . " Hammersm ark , for some reason , thought this funny . Rita was very young . Hammersmark first met her in a small college town where he had gone to lecture . She was the daughter of the professor of geology , and she was impersonating the role of the fatal enchantress . She mowed men down , she devastated them , and her eye play would have taught things to a lighthouse with a thirty-second flash . Hammersmark , watching her with appreciation , had a feeling of warm content . Then he had fallen in love with her and married her . He had spent one evening in thought as to the best means of attack and decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private amusements that no one but himself suspected that that smashing courtship of his had been the child of cerebration . The enormous Hammersmark had come rushing down upon Rita and scattered her numerous admirers to the wind like chaff . He had brushed aside the man she was engaged to like a fly . His jealousy had been gigantic . If a twittering college boy had come near her , Rita was convinced that he would have been crushed by Hammersmark 's great fists . It had been a great courtship and Hammers-mark a romantic figure . Then he had married Rita , bought her a big house , and suddenly Rita had only to wish , to have anything she wanted . Once married , where was the enchantress , the woman of the fatal glance ? Gone  --  gone over night . Rita was now a chatelaine and a devoted wife . Hammersmark had watched the sudden change with appreciation . Rita 's new role had touched him at first , but after a year he had become accustomed to it and so had she . Lately she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out more , " Hammersmark told his cousin Mildred Graham . " We 've been married over a year and the little thing has been buried in the house listening to me talk . The psychological moment has come for a little mild flirtation . " " You mean the psychological moment for a baby , " his cousin replied . " No , not yet , " Hammersmark said with tenderness . " The little thing 's too young . She needs some romance which I ca n't furnish . " He glanced across the ballroom where Rita was sitting with a man whom Hammersmark sought to place and who vaguely reminded him of an Arabian snake charmer . Rita had been dancing with him all the evening and there was a certain ostentation in her manner when she passed her husband . Once , when Hammersmark had rolled his good-natured bulk towards her , she had introduced Danton , but with a shrinking air as though she expected her husband to commit murder . When Hammersmark next danced with her : " Paul , " she ventured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dan-ton , do you ? " He stared down at her with innocent blue eyes . " Mind ? " he said , " Mind , Rita ? Why , of course I do n't mind . " " You know his reputation , " said Rita darkly ; " it is terrible ! " He knew he should n't have done it , he should have said : " Let him try anything , " with a fee-fi-fo-fum expression . Instead , he threw back his head , and rotund , satisfying , deep laughter boomed out across the ballroom . It was this inopportune laughter of his that was always making him trouble . He could n't help it . He was always laughing at Rita . She was so inconsequential , so pretty , and so absurd . She afforded him unending diversion . " My husband , " Rita said proudly , " is a terribly jealous man , " and she recounted the days of her romantic courtship . " That , " said Danton , " was before you were married . Has he ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any cause , " said Rita . " Now he would be like all the rest , " said Danton . " He takes you for granted . " She had used her fatal eyes on Dan-ton . It was fun . She had forgotten all about how devastating she could be . In the meantime she kept a wary eye on Paul . Any moment he would come down upon her roaring and snatch her away from Danton . To her surprise , she looked around the room and he was gone . She thought hopefully that perhaps he was too angry to speak to her . Maybe he had even gone home without her . But there he was , developing one of his theories with that everlasting bore , Stillman . Hammersmark had watched her manceuvering with Dan ton , gazing at her with affection and loving amusement . Then , when he encountered Stillman , he forgot Rita in a discussion of the psychology of social gatherings and their relationship to mob psychology . Hammersmark maintained that each social occasion had its overtone created by the composite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into a dissertation on the overtone of parties where only men were present , and forgot Rita so completely that she had to look for him when the party was almost over . She slipped in furtively . Hammers-mark put his arm around her and drew her toward him . She looked enchanting . In the car he went on developing the theory of the overtone of parties . " Now this was a good party , " he said ; " it had an edge . It was on the verge of breaking into flame . I like that . The trouble with some parties where everyone drinks a little , is that they have the essence of orgy , you want to go on from there . " " Much you know about this party , " said Rita , " off in a corner with Stillman all the evening . You might as well have been at home . " " Oh no , " protested Hammersmark , " I could feel it vibrate . I could feel it getting to the point of an explosion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties where there are both men and women should be more philosophical than they are . People drink and get excited , they get to the point of orgy until someone passes out from sheer frustration . " Rita was n't listening ; she seldom listened . How could she when he talked to her so perpetually ? " Paul , " she said seriously , " I hope I did n't make you uncomfortable tonight . " With a wide good-humored gesture he drew her to him . " Me uncomfortable ? " " I hope , " Rita explained , " you were not jealous . " Hammersmark roared . His deep laughter echoed into the night . " Jealous of the handsome sword swallower ? " he said . He laughed again . " In that case , " said Rita coldly , " I 'll ' phone him I can have tea with him to-morrow . " " Now a party of two at tea , " said Hammersmark , " a man and a woman who have n't known each other lung and are a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rita withdrew herself into the corner of the car . " Tired ? " Hammersmark asked sympathetically . He drew Rita to him again affectionately and put her head on his shoulder . She 's bothered about something , he thought . He puzzled upon what was disturbing her . He remembered her furtive , almost guilty manner when she had interrupted his conversation with Stillman . Her embarrassment when she had introduced him to Danton . Poor little kid , he thought , she 's afraid I 'll spoil her fun by being jealous . He felt suffused with tenderness . She was adorable . He wanted to put his arms around her . He glanced at her . She lay relaxed upon his shoulder , her eyes closed . Poor kid , he thought , she 's tired . Rita was undressed first . She sat up in bed , looking at Hammersmark . " You never would be jealous , " she asked in a forlorn voice . He bent over her reassuringly . " Never worry about me being jealous , " he said paternally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Rita clenched her fists . Thatwas what Danton had told her . " American men , " he had said , " do not understand their wives . Take your husband he 's buried in vast experi-ments which he makes profitable . They care for their wives less than animals for their mates . Animals are at least jealous . " Danton was right . And now , this final insult . Her husband had the assurance to tell her he would never be jealous of her . She met Danton at tea the next afternoon . " He was n't jealous ? " Danton inquired . " Not in the least , " said Rita . " He told me he never would be jealous . " " Romance , " said Danton , " has gone out of the relations between married people in this country . And yet , romance is the most necessary thing in the world . Why are the women of this country so restless ? They are starved for romance . It is as necessary as air . You yourself -- - " his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of love as it should be while the other side of his mind rolled over contentedly the knowledge of how much money Paul Hammersmark was worth . He probably lets her have everything she wants , he reflected . The afternoon sped by . " There is an Englishman writing , Sydney Sunderland , who has shown how life can be lived . When I see you next time , I shall bring you a book of his , " he said . Time ! What time was it ? Panic seized Rita . Paul would be home and she would n't be there . " I must go . I must go right away ! " she said . Danton 's ambiguous smile told her that , in his opinion , her anxiety was wasted . She got home just in time for dinner . Paul was buried in one of his books that Rita could not understand . THE ROMANTIC MAN " Hello , " he said . He stretched out a big arm and put it around her without lifting his eyes from his book . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rita watched him observantly . How he ate ! How luxuriously and yet how enormously . Romance ? She was surprised that she could ever imagine there could be romance with a man like Paul . She saw a mountain of a man . Good-looking , yes . Distinguished , of course . But what was that when he engulfed food so prodigiously ? He ate and drank Gargantuan meals . And he had always done it , only she had never observed before how revolting this was . She watched Paul curiously as though she had never sat with him before at table . For indeed he had a great gusto for life . He loved play and work and Rita with engrossing intensity . At present he loved eating . Rita turned away from him . He had always seemed to her the man who had come swooping down on her , powerful and godlike , and carried her off without time for her to say " boo , " carried her off from a small-college town life into an interesting world  --  from a world of modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ princess , she had only to wish to make her dreams come true . His hunger appeased , Hammersmark looked smilingly toward Rita . " What are you pondering on so deeply ? " he asked her . " I was thinking how awful it is to live in a world where there 's no romance , " she said . " Romance , " boomed Hamrnersmark , " there 's always romance . Romance is right here . It always exists , but like air in different altitudes in different places , it has its rarity and its density . " He was off . " No romance , " he cried . " With the very face of the world changing under our eyes . With great empirescrumpling within a few years . With the new experiments in government being tried in Russia and Italy . Think of China  --  plunge your mind into it . " By the time be was through he had imagined the marriage of Slav and the Asiatic , the suicide of Europe and a new culture rising , while a human yellow tide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He pointed out to her that man 's scientific knowledge had outstripped man 's power to use it . The white races had unleashed power too vast for them . Suicide or salvation stood before the door , and no one knew which . " Do you see nothing of romance in this ? " he pleaded earnestly . " I meant the romance of personal relations and the relations between men and women . You , Paul , are too engrossed in your experiments to realize what I mean . " " Engrossed ! " he boomed , " of course I 'm engrossed ! The men of my generation are engrossed in a conquest of nature that may destroy us  --  or we may hit on something that will change the surface of the earth as much as the discoveries that led to the industrial revolution . As for human relationships , you might as well talk of the steam engine destroying the biological nature of man , " he was off again . He explained to her patiently how the human drama of desire , hate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death , went on unmindful of the incalculable forces changing man 's life on earth . " Why ? " asked Rita , " are the women of America so restless ? They are starving for romance . " He threw back his head with a copious laugh which boomed through the room . He shook the glasses . He rolled with laughter . " Do you mean to tell me , Rita , that you think that the restlessness of American women is caused because we have no more gentlemen under windows twanging on lutes ? Then are American women restless ? Which women ? Ever since the seventeenth century , when the culture of the Middle Ages cracked forever , life has been in a turmoil , with a froth of women on the top of it bobbing like corks . Restless ? Again , which women are restless ? The bubbling froth or the cool , unchanging mass of women engrossed in their immemorial pursuits ? You think there 's no romance ! Even in your sense of the word you ca n't go round the corner without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a coal miner , an epic  --  to be classed with the great loves of history ! " " Oh , I know life could be beautiful even now , " said Rita wistfully . Silence had fallen on Hammersmark . He puffed at his cigar , arose deliberately , his eyes fixed on some vague distance . He paused at Rita 's chair , patted her shoulder with a big paw , lifted up her face , kissed her heartily , said " pretty girl " in an absent-minded voice . Rita sighed . She knew what had happened . Paul had an idea ; now he had gone to his library and she would n't see him again before she went to sleep . Very likely lie would be absorbed for days in the laboratory . She would see him only at meals and there would be no talk . His talk always made pictures for her . It did to-night ; she saw blinding explosions and a soft yellowish tide of men creeping vastly over shattered Europe . She shivered . He was really too awful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stillman on the street : " Stillman , " he said , " I 've got bold of the tail of an idea . " " You get hold of the tail of too many ideas , " said Stillman , " and while you 're trying to catch ideas Rita is running around with that bounder Danton . " " She 'll find him out , " said Hammersmark easily " She 'll find him out after he 's pried a lot of money out of her . " " So ? So ? " mused Hammersmark . He had a vague memory of Rita saying that she should run the house and asking him to deposit the money for everything to her account . He walked home in good humor . Rita had n't come in yet , and he felt a shock of disappointment . Now he was going to play and have a good time . He went up to Rita 's room and sat down , meditating with satisfaction on Rita and her funny ways . He loved her . He picked up a book lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was by Sydney Sunderland . There was an inscription from Danton . He dipped into it a little way . He read on , shaking with laughter , then he rose and telephoned the club where he knew he would find Stillman . " Stillman , what do you know about this fellow Danton ? " " I know enough to land him in Sing Sing if I wanted the trouble of the beastly mess . Awful bounder . Got a fat wife and eight children in Chicago . " He explained with some picturesque detail what he knew concerning Danton . " I 'll have to stop this , " muttered Hammersmark . " Ca n't see the poor little kid 's fun all spoiled . " Rita greeted him affectionately . He sat down in an armchair . " Come over here and sit on my knee , " he said in a wheedling voice . Her good temper vanished . He treated her like a child . It was as bad as Nora in the Doll 's House . She was a plaything to be picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however . He stroked her hair . He had only to say , he reflected , " Danton has a fat wife and eight children in Chicago , " and then her little soap bubble of romance would evaporate . He could n't do it . Got to fix it some other way . The next morning early he rolled into Danton 's apartment . Danton stared at him and drew himself up awaiting hostilities . - Look here , Danton , " he began with deep and shamefaced embarrassment , " it 'll about wind me if you ask me to what you owe this pleasure . It 's awkward enough having to come anyhow . You see how it is , though . I ca n't have Rita in a mess like this . Hang it all , I do n't want her fun to be spoiled for her . " Danton opened his mouth . " Do n't , " implored Hammersmark , " do n't . Let me do the talking . It 's really a favor to you . They 've found out all about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that is , you understand , unless you want to be arrested . " He was horribly embarrassed . " You ca n't bully me , " began Dan-ton , " or bluff me into leaving town either . " " Bully ? Bluff ? Why listen here , Danton . " Hammersmark recounted some of the details Stillman had given him . " I do n't want Rita annoyed , so I 'm doing you a favor . Now , see here , you sit down and write Rita a romantic letter . Tell her about how you ca n't see her any more because she 's too dangerous to your peace of mind , and about how if you do n't see her again your love for her will always be spring in blossom , an eternal spring , see , and then you add that you 've changed your mind about the money . What 'd you want the money for , anyhow ? " " It was for a young sculptor . A year in Paris , " muttered Danton . " Well , you just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something about her memory being too precious to let the thought of money be among your memories . Something Like that . Now do n't , do n't , " heimplored , " bluster . Be a good fellow and save trouble and go ahead , and then you leave for Chicago onahe next train , of course , and do n't try to see Rita or write to her or telegraph or anything . It wo n't be any use , you know . No use at all . You see it wo n't be any use , " he said shamefacedly . " I 've got a lot of beastly detectives that are going to watch everything you do . And anyway , if you stay , the police will get you . " He shook himself when he got into the street and , drawing a long breath , be thought : " Gee , I feel just like a fellow in a comic strip . I bet that fellow up there is writhing around the room hissing , Foiled ' . " His thoughts dwelt with tenderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway , " thought Hammersmark . " But now how is she going to get on ? " was his next disquieting reflection . " Her appetite is just whetted , she 's just tasted blood . " He thought of Rita 's longing for romance as a mild disease suitable for a young woman of her years which in time would run its course . " She 's got to romance with a nice chap , " he thought . In his perplexity , he sought his cousin , Mildred Graham , who adored Rita . He told her the story of Danton . " The matter with Rita , " said Mildred , " is that she 's arrived at the period when a young wife imagines that her husband no longer loves her . " " You do n't understand Rita , " said Hammersmark , " she ca n't think that . She knows I adore her . Rita 's playacting . Do n't you remember when I first saw her how she was impersonating the fatal woman who was so dashed irresistible ? ? took me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the devoted wife . She 's sick of that now . I saw it coming on . She wants a little mild romance , as I told you before . Look at me , Mildred . Can I supply that want ? Am I a romantic figure ? Am I a Valentino ? " " You might be a dark Othello , " Mrs. Graham suggested . " Jealous ! " he cried , " What ? jealous of Rita ? Spoil the poor little kid 's fun and scare her half to death ? " " Paul , " said Mrs. Graham , " you know about as much of psychology as a walrus . " At a tea a few days later at Mildred Graham 's , Rita had never looked more lovely . Danton 's letter was in her bag . The affair had ended perfectly , and she was glad to have him out of the way . He had been making her vaguely uneasy . Across the room sat a man , slender and dark-eyed , who had been staring directly at her ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , but she knew he was looking at her . Presently Mildred introduced them . He sat down beside Rita . " I 've got to paint you . I 've been looking at you all the afternoon , and must paint you . Please let me tell you about it . Once in a very long time one sees someone one has to paint . I 'm unknown , and it 's an awful impertinence just to rush at you like this , but please think it over . Do n't say no right away . You ca n't know what it 'll mean to me ! " He was sincere and eager and boyish . Rita promised . She was staying on for dinner . " Do you think that Paul will like your posing like that for Bobbie Pierce ? " asked Mildred Graham . " He wo n't care , " said Rita lightly . " He lets me do exactly as 1 like . " " Of course he lets you do exactly as you like , " said Mildred , " but this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made an impression on Bobbie . Do you think Paul will like your spending your time with a fascinating young man ? Paul 's older than you , and being proud he 'd be the last one to let you know if he were jealous . " " Paul , jealous of me ? " said Rita lightly . " Paul is n't romantic enough to be jealous . He 'd be just as apt to be jealous of the kitten . " " Paul could order your portrait painted , and that would be putting it on a business basis , and you could take someone along if you wanted to . " " And spoil everything , " said Rita . Paul 's huge form loomed in the doorway . " Paul , " said Rita , " Mildred 's positively mid-Victorian . There 's a young painter wants to do a sketch of me , and Mildred thinks you wo n't like it . She thinks I ought to take a chaperon along . It 's the young painter , Bobbie Pierce , you know . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he laughed . He added with a puzzled look at Mildred , " I think it 's fine . " The picture was finished . Rita and Bobbie Pierce stood before it . Rita put her hand in his . " I want to buy it , " she said . " Listen , " said Bobbie , " do n't let 's Calk about things like that . Not today . It 's the last time you 'll be here . Will you do one thing for me , Rita ? I want you to have lunch with me here . Do n't say you wo n't . Just a funny little make believe  --  as if you and I always had lunch together . Do n't say no . It 's already ordered . Please stay , " his words tumbled up on top of each other . " It means so much to me . You do n't know how much it means . This is n't a luncheon like other luncheons  --  it 's a sort of ceremony . " First , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture . " Rita saw the cocktail was cool and frosted the glasses . It was intricately made , delicious and warming , not a hot , heady drink . It slipped down like sunshine . Bobbie pulled out an oak table and put on it a Venetian cloth . He decorated it carefully and painstakingly . There were flowers and pieces of silver and old-fashioned , long-stemmed glasses . Rita watched him as he came and went . How quick he was and how deft . The thought of Paul crossed her mind . Paul , rolling huge and jovial into the room . Paul , with his sudden deep laughter about things that she did n't understand . She put the thought from her . Something was rattling at the door of her memory , something that was very far off was asking to be let in . Then she knew what it was . She was a little girl sitting on the sand . Rocks towered above her in which there were pools where you could find sea urchins and shrimps and little fishes left by the tide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She and a brown-eyed boy were arranging a luncheon , a white napkin for a cloth , shells for dishes . There were tiny , tiny sandwiches . It was an hour marked apart from the rest of life , solitary and beautiful . This moment was like that enchanted hour . " You look happy , " said Bobbie . " Of course I 'm happy , " said Rita . She told him about the picnic on the beach . " This is where we step out of life just as you did then . It 's our moment , it 's ours , and we belong to each other for an hour . Here 's to our moment ! " They drank from the fairy glasses . It was a very gay luncheon . Everything Bobbie said made Rita laugh . He was carried away on the tide of his own imagery . He worked on the theory that telling women how lovely they were made them more beautiful . As he talked Rita felt herself transfigured . " Oh , what 's the use of talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have it all there . It 's beautiful , it 's the best thing I 've done . Peoplewill stop to look at that picture , and every one of them will fall in love with you . Oh , Rita , you darling ! " He kissed her . The afternoon was over . Rita struggled to say a gay good-by . She reflected that this hour of innocent romance was like an unexpected gift to a child who had no toys . She felt sorry for herself . The days they had spent together , the things that he had said and the things that he had kept from saying had formed a bond between them . Something quite lovely had happened , and now it was over . The romance was finished . This afternoon was the last chapter . She would go home , and there would be Paul . He would dress to go to one of those scientific dinners of his , and she would go to the opera . Tears came to her eyes , her shoulders drooped . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why , you 're almost crying . " He put his arm around her . " Rita , you 're unhappy . You 've never told me , but I 've always known it . It 's awful to live with people who do n't understand you . " He had said this often before . It almost always worked . He always forgot that he had said it , and always felt as if he said it for the first time , for he adored philandering . He philandered charmingly , and it had no relation to the main purpose of his life . " Why are you crying , Rita ? " he implored , for slow tears were sliding down her cheeks . She had the sensation of acute homesickness . " It 's because it 's over , " she said forlornly . " It 's only over because you want it to be over , " said Bobbie . " Rita , I love you . " She gazed at him in silence . In a flat , incredulous voice she repeated : " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You can step out from real life when you want to . " " I must go , " she said sadly . " Only because you want to , " said Bobbie , ? and when you want to come back I shall be waiting for you . " " Perhaps I 'll come back to-night , " said Rita . She smiled at him tenderly , mockingly , her head on one side . " Rita , " said Bobbie , " do n't laugh at me . I mean it . To-night , tomorrow , forever  --  always you 'll find me waiting for you . " He kissed her solemnly . " Good-by , " said Rita . Bobbie held the door open as she went down the stairs . Then he walked to his picture . It had been a lovely third act to a comedy . Rita was adorable , he reflected . She had a true gift for delicate and light encounters . He reflected how few women there were in the world with her understanding . There were so few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment required . As Rita drove home one thing emerged from the confusion of her thoughts . She must tell Paul . He would be furious . It would take her golden hour from her , but she must tell him . She needed to be protected from herself . There was Danton  --  there was Bobbie . She could n't go on like this . She would make a clean breast of everything and then start anew . Paul was in his study This was forbidden ground . He went to his study to work . She opened the door of this forbidden room and Paul , like a bluebeard , turned toward her a shaggy head . " Paul , " she said , " I have to tell you something . " He put up a protesting hand . " Later , " he implored . " Paul , Bobbie Pierce  --  wants me to ? come to him ! He kissed met " Paul looked at her blankly . " Rita , " he said , " I have an idea by the tail ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room and shut the door behind her . She went to her own room and stared before her . The truth had stepped out and confronted her . She had always known it , she had refused to recognize it . Paul did n't love her . He did n't care what became of her . She could n't stay another minute in this house where she could have everything but love . She had started to confess to him , and he had n't even listened  --  he had n't even cared . The thought of Bobbie came consolingly to her . She would go hack to him . She could imagine the rush of surprise when she came in . But in fairness to Paul she would tell him . She went to her desk . " Paul , " she wrote , " since you no longer love me I am going . Bobbie loves me and he is waiting for me . You could have stopped me , Paul , if you had cared . " She left the note where he could n't fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was , how awful ! At a precise moment he would be called for dinner . Then he would drop his idea for which he had shoved her aside . She was filled to the brim with fury . As she drove down Fifth Avenue she felt like an atom being whirled into darkness . Where ? She did n't know . Then like an explosion she knew she could n't do it . Who was Bobbie Pierce ? A young painter who said pretty things to one . She did n't love him . In desperation she realized that she loved Paul , and Paul did n't love her . Now she had cut herself off from Paul . It was too /ate to go back . By now Paul would have read her note and very likely he would he glad . No , he would n't be glad , he would ? he disgusted . She hungered for someone who loved her and who could advise her .

She must m awfully upset , poor little thought , to rush in like that- , had n't listened to her . What was she had said ? Oh , it was about Bobbie Pierce having made love to her , and she had taken it seriously , wanted to confess to him . In spite of himself Paul laughed aloud . He knew Bobbie Pierce with his philandering ways , which did n't interfere in the least with his work or his love for Mary Deane , to whom he was engaged . Still laughing , " Rita certainly has hard luck , " Paul thought . Then he saw the letter . He read it and his laughter filled the room . He could see with what dexterity Bobbie Pierce would turn this aside . " I should n't laugh , " he thought , " but Lord , it 's funny . " He laughed while he dressed . While he was shaving , laughter swept over him again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gashed his throat , a bad cut , deep and bloody . The housemaid tapped and , receiving nu answer , came in .

" You 'll have to ' phone the doctor ! God damn it ! " The girl was speeding downstairs . The telephone in Mrs. Graham 's apartment buzzed . Mechanically Rita answered . An excited voice came over the ' phone . " Oh , Mrs. Graham , oh , Mrs. Graham , Mr. Hammersmark 's cut his throat ! Oh , come quick , Mrs. Graham ! " " Is he dead ? " Rita managed to gasp . " Oh , no , he wo n't die , I got there in time ! He was cutting it when I came in ! And I saw Mrs. Hammersmark 's letter open on his dresser . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Graham ! Oh , come quick !

And you running away ! " " Oh , ca n't you see , ca n't you see what 's happened ? " sobbed Rita . " I thought he did n't love me , but when he got my letter  --  he 's been suffering all the time and absorbing himself more and more in his work so I would n't see it . Then when I  --  I left , I wrote him . And he read my letter  --  and he cut his throat ! " They arrived at the house .
