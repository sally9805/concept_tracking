txt With operations in the black in the initial half of the year for the first time since 1930 and domestic business showing an increase of between 40% and 50% for the period , American Radiator &; Standard Sanitary Corp . is headed for one of the most successful years since predepression times . The upward swing in the sales and profits of the company , which originally got under way early in 1934 , received added impetus during the fall of last year as the provisions of the National Housing Act became operative . And still further stimulation has been given during the current year by the sharp revival in residential building v  --  hich has been in progress for the past six months or so . Although the home modernization campaign results have not been up to the early expectations of many interests in the building materials supply industry , the advance in the volume of home building has been at least as large as was generally anticipated . In the first six months of the year , residential building contracts were about 58% ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any like period since 1931 . Of late months , the Increase has been even more pronounced . June 's awards running almost double those of a year ago and on the highest level of any month since October , 1931 . Radiator 's Last Year Best Since 1930 Radiator in 1934 reported its first profit for any year since 193 and the first earnings applicable to its common stock since 1930 . Net of Si , - 455,277 was equivalent , after preferred dividends , to 11 cents a share on the outstanding 10,041,086 no-par shares of common stock after allowing for preferred dividends In 1933 and 1932 losses of $881,575 and $5,990.986 , respectively , were registered . The peak of earnings of the present company  --  a consolidation of the American Radiator Co. and the Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Co. ? was established in 1929 , the first year of its corporate existence , when net amounted to $20,012,171 , equal to $2.02 a share on the average 9,640.490 common shares outstanding during the year . Foreign business continues to make a satisfactory showing , running about in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years in the company 's history Radiator has 11 foreign affiliates , with plants located in the principal European countries . During recent years this branch of the company 's activities has been making a better showing than the domestic departments and has aided materially in " sweetening " the profit and loss statement of the parent organization . Of its important domestic branches , the sanitary ware division is making the most spectacular recovery . Sales so far this year have been about 60% ahead of the like period of 1934 , with all plants in operation with the exception of the Pittsburgh unit , and it is expected that pressure or orders will cause the reopening of that plant within a month or so . The gaining rate of operations of this division is particularly encouraging in respect to future earnings . inasmuch as an advance in prices of the line averaging between 10% and 15C , has just been put into effect . Pricing Method Has Popular Appeal The better relative showing to date of the sanitary ware division as compared with the radiator and boiler department is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former 's products and the large amount of plumbing work generated by the government 's home modernization program . Also , that subsidiary is rapidly bettering its trade position by recapturing business lost following a change in the method of quoting prices put into effect last September . Made with the idea of enaoling the ultimate consumer to know more accurately the cost of the materials to be employed in plumbing work , the new method of pricing met with some antagonism from the plumbing trade Its popular appeal , however , has largely overcome this resistance and also has been instrumental in acquiring additional trade out-lets Operations of the radiator and boiler division , although relatively less active than the unitary ware department , are at the highest point in a number of years and likely to show a further substantial stepping-up in the near future as demand develops from building projects started during the spring and early summer . Normally there is an average lag of around four months between the awarding of the building contract and the time when the installation of the heating equipment is posvane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way would seem to insure increasing bookings well into the fall . To take care of this expected business , the company is now busily engaged in putting its large Buffalo plant in condition to resume operations later in the year . Notwithstanding the substantial Improvement in its business . Radiator 's activities are still greatly below the normal capacity of its plants . In 1934 , as an example , gross sales of $81,737.000 were only about 45 , , of those of 1029 when volume reached 3181.797,000 Also , it is probable that capacity has been further Increased since that time through improvement in facilities and refinements in methods of manufacture .
