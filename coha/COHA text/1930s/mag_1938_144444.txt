Hard pressed to find money to finance the Third Reich 's armament race . Field Marshal Hermann Wilhelm Gring last week prepared to adopt outright thievery as an economy policy . The multi-uniformed economic dictator signed a decree providing for confiscation of practically all Jewish property throughout Greater Germany . <P> Jewish real estate and money holdings in Germany are estimated at $2.000,000,000 , in German Austria at $800,000,000 . The sweeping Goring decree demanded registration of all Jewish holdings worth more than $2,000 ( 5,000 marks ) and forbade sales and transfers of Jewish property without Government permission . Gring also provided stiff prison terms for recalcitrants using " Aryan " dummies or splitting up their properties . Nazi spokesmen admitted that the decree was a preliminary measure to dispossession and confiscation of what Jewish wealth still remained in Germany . <P> Responsible for the elimination of Jewish economic life in Austria will be hard-hitting Josef Brckel , a non-Austrian , known for his success in taming Catholics in the Saar-Palatinate . Last week Herr Brckel received from Adolf Hitler dictatorial powers over Austria which reduce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paved the way for Hitler 's triumph there , to that of a subordinate . <P> Believing the Easter truce on anti-Semitic demonstrations over , prankish Storm Troopers rounded up hundreds of Jews in Vienna 's parks , marshaled them into parade formation , roared with laughter when they forced them to perform a burlesque of the goose step through the city 's amusement centre . The troopers made Jewish cafe patrons scrub floors and wash windows , and escorted through the streets customers from Jewish stores who were forced to carry signs reading : " I am an Aryan pig . I bought from a Jewish shop . " Meanwhile , the official Vienna Nazi newsorgan Vlkischer Beobachter , after declaring that by 1942 no Jew would have the opportunity to earn a living in Vienna , warned : " Jews ! Abandon all hope . Our net is so fine that you will not find a hole in it through which you can slip to return to the fleshpots of Egypt . There is only one possibility for you : emigrate - if some one will accept you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vienna just as much as his buoyant Storm Troopers , the Nazi organ , believed to reflect his views , declared there will be no pogroms , " reminded everyone that " Germany is a land of justice . " In Manhattan arrived Fhrer Fritz Kuhn of the German-American Bund after a trip to Germany and Austria . Met by two gray-coated , black-trousered Bund officers , Fuhrer Kuhn brought back a message from German Jews to American Jews . " I talked with lots and lots of Jews in Germany , " Kuhn said , " and they all told me this : ' Tell the Jews in America to let us alone . We 're all right . ' Thousands of Jews are returning to Germany and I was really surprised to see how many Jewish stores were open . "
