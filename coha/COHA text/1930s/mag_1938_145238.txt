" beneath a proclamation canceling last week the September " Crisis " Proclamation under which the Royal Navy was put under partial , later full mobilization . The new proclamation proclaimed : " His Majesty , by and with the advice of his Privy Council , doth hereby declare that a case of emergency no longer exists . " <P> On the Channel steamer going over to France last week Prime Minister &; Mrs. Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary &; Lady Halifax had a thoroughgoing tossing about . On deck Mr. Chamberlain nearly did a split and the long lean Foreign Secretary got a buffeting ( see cut ) . The diplomatic traveling companions had an easier trip back two days later , the day the King signed his parchment . It was , of course , the Prime Minister who " advised " the Sovereign to demobilize the Fleet . His Majesty did so presumably because Mr. Chamberlain was satisfied , after talking in Paris with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this European emergency had ended . Officially this week , H. M. 's Government announced that Chamberlain &; Halifax " plan " to visit Benito Mussolini in January 1939 , unofficially that Halifax may go with the King to Canada in the spring .
