txt Old-Age Insurance Dr. Witte Further Explains The Pending Bill To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : As you published my letter of June 17 , and thus gave publicity to the fact that the Social Security Advisory Council , contrary to the general belief , did not recommend the postponement of the increase in the old-age insurance taxes which is provided for in the bill amending the Social Security Act now before Congress , I take this occasion to correct what appear to me to be some further misimpressions regarding the pending bill . In your editorial commenting on my letter , you quote at some length from the report of the Advisory Council to make the point that the council recognized that " with the changes in benefit structnre here- recommended and with the introduction of a definite program of governmental contributions to the system * * * the size of the old-age insurance fund will be kept within much lower limits than are involved in the present act . " That is not only a correct quotation but expresses accurately the position of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The introduction of a definite program of governmental contributions to the system " was considered by myself and other members of the majority of the council to be a satisfactory substitute for a sizable reserve . Federal Aid Withdrawn What you overlook in your editorial is that the pending bill does not provide for " governmental contributions to the system . " On the contrary , it eliminates the element of governmental contribution included in the present aqt in the form of interest rates on oldage insurance funds in excess of those paid on moneys borrowed from private lenders . The Ways and Means Committee states in its report that by 1955 a deficit will develop in the old-age insurance fund , but does not suggest that governmental contribution should be introduced at that point . What the pending bill does is not to introduce governmental contributions but to leave uncertain from what source , if at all , the retirement benefits to all people who are now less than 49 years of age are to be paid . You also have taken no account of the fact that Congress so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Security Advisory Council to extend the coverage of the oldage insurance system to agricultural employes , private domestic servants , and still other groups , but has excluded from possibility of getting retirement benefits many millions of the younger workers of the present day . This is the result of the adoption of standards of eligibility copied from the provisions of the group annuity contracts of private insurance companies and industrial pensions plans , which you have mistaken for " sound social insurance practices . " Assumption Held in Error Finally , another word about " that $47,000,000,000 reserve . " You state correctly that the $47,000,000,000 Computation first occurred in the report of the Senate Finance Committee on the Social Security Act in 1935 . What you overlook is that one of the actuarial consultants of the Committee on Economic Security , who made this computation , has been the most determined critic outside of Congress of the Federal old-age insurance system , while Senator Vandenberg , who , of all members of Congress , has had most to say about the alleged $47,000,000,000 reserve in 1935 , voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security Act . It is my contention that the 1935 computation was based not upon the provisions of the Social Security Act but upon assumptions of the actuaries which have no foundation in the law itself . What is more important is that these assumptions have been proved very erroneous ? by the experience of the first year of the actual collection of old-age insurance taxes . Far more people are included within the old-age insurance system , and average wages are much lower than the actuaries assumed , with the net result that the reserve in 1980 will be very much less Than the $47,000,000,000 which the actuaries estimated . Their estimate was honestly made , and in 1935 their assumptions were not unreasonable . But these factors have been proved to be very incorrect and they no longer furnish any good reason for reducing taxes . Forestalling Danger The writer has appeared before the Senate Finance Committee and supported the pending bill , although pointing out that it leaves uncertain how the benefits of present younger workers are to be financed , and opposing the restriction of coverage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eligibility for ? etirement benefits for the liberal proisions of the present law . As you state , the pending bill does Incorporate the recommendations of the . Social Security Advisory Council with regard to the kinds and amounts of benefits . This is a very great improvement , which will be worth all the additional costs which it involves . It is to be hoped , moreover , that the laying of the false reserve issue will serve to bring the re ess and the leading business organizations into whole-hearted support of the old-age insurance system . That system is still in very grave danger of being scrapped within the next few years for some sort of a " baby Townsend Plan , " which would prove . financially ruinous and would endanger our entire economic system . To forestall that danger it is important to keep before the public the necessity of extending the coverage of the old-age insurance system in order to include our entire population and to actually make governmental contributions to the costs of old-age insurance .
