Tireless Alan Frederick Lascelles , acting private secretary to George VI , was kept busy last week during Their Majesties ' home-bound tour of New Brunswick , Prince Edward Island , Nova Scotia and <P> Newfoundland , writing bread- &-butter; letters to their U. S. hosts . King George , of course , addressed President Franklin in person : <P> " The kindness shown to us personally by you both was endorsed by your fellow countrymen and countrywomen with a cordiality that has stirred our hearts . <P> " In Washington , in New York and , indeed , wherever we have been in the United States , we have been accorded a reception of which the friendliness was unmistakable . <P> " Though this was our first visit to your great country , and though it was necessarily only a brief one , it has given us memories of kindly feeling and goodwill that we shall always treasure . " <P> But if future anthropologists ever have to plot the world 's transition from male to female dominance they may well refer to Their Majesties ' visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women involved . <P> <P> &gt; Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth broadcast from Halifax : " To the people of Canada and to all the kind people in the United States who welcomed us so warmly last week , to one and all on this great , friendly continent , I say thank you , God be with you and God bless you . Au revoir et Dieu vous bnisse . " <P> &gt; Anna Eleanor Roosevelt Roosevelt , in her unique column , My Day , let go with both barrels of a female news-sense . <P> " The Queen told us that when she talked to her two young daughters over the telephone yesterday they were much amused that she was about to go to luncheon , when the younger one was about to go to bed . They were not in the least interested in the heat of Washington because they have been having a heat wave in London . . . . <P> " We stood and waved , but my mother-in-law reminded us of the old superstition that one must not watch people out of sight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our cars and on our way home . . . . <P> " At Hyde Park the servants* we brought from Washington suffered from a jinx which followed its course in three mishaps ! My mother-in-law 's serving table in the dining room has a center standard . Too many dishes were put on one side , and in the middle of the dinner the table tipped over . No one could think for a minute because of the noise of breaking china . <P> " Later in the evening with a tray full of glasses , water , ginger ale and bottles , one of our men going into the big library slipped and dropped the entire tray on the floor . And , as a final catastrophe , on Sunday afternoon my husband , moving backward across the grass by the swimming pool , almost sat on another tray of glasses and pop bottles ! <P> " On each occasion Their Majesties remained completely calm and undisturbed . . . . " <P> &gt; Portcullis Pursuivant Anthony Richard Wagner of London 's College of Arms revealed that Her Majesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> &gt; The U. S. Secret Service ( through Frank J. Wilson , chief ) announced : " The thing that sticks out is that no one seemed to want to do them any harm . "
