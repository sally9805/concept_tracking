In Sawdust Caesar , Author George Seldes stuck out his tongue at Benito Mussolini . In Lords of the Press , he thumbed his nose at U. S. journalism . Last week , in The Catholic Crisis ( Messner , $3 ) , Author Seldes uttered some hoarse Bronx cheers at the Roman Catholic Church . His thesis is that the Church has dallied too long with Fascism , and his book suggests that his way of fixing things would be to have someone like Oswald Garrison Villard for Pope . He devotes more than 300 pages to accusing Catholic churchmen and laymen of all manner of misdeeds-pressure against the press and the cinema , devious activities in politics , assaults on civil liberties-which , though in part damaging , are not all germane to the subject . Privately last week , George Seldes admitted to friends that he was annoyed : for at least the first week after publication , The Catholic Crisis was not even mentioned in Manhattan newspapers .                 @ @ @ @
