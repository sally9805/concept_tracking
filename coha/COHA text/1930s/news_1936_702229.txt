txt Asserting without reservation that additional regulation of investment trusts is necessary and desirable , Robert Lehman , president of the Lehman Corporation , presented a twelve-point program today during the inquiry into investment trusts by the Securities and Exchange Commission . He recommended that all trusts issue quarterly reports based upon standard accounting , should furnish full public information on operations , including such things as direct transactions , underwriting activities and brokerage commissions . Items Urged by Robert Lehman I Specifically , the twelve items that he urged should be included in the reports , in addition to those customarily included , were : 1 . List all sales to and purchases from sponsors , officers and directors , stating date of transaction , amount and title of security and prices . 2 . List joint purchases or sales , stating names of participants and interest of each . ( Details of trans-actions under ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) to be available to stockholder on call . at principal office . Net asset value to be available at any time upon inquiry from stockholder. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securities , or those of a subsidiary or affiliate , show amount and cost , and source . 4 . Gross brokerage ? per cent of assets , to whom paid . 5 . Brokerage paid , not at regular exchange rates , to whom paid . 6 . Brokerage received by director , officer or sponsor on sale to trust . 7 . Reveal underwriting obligations specifically . Report results of any underwritings. 8 . Report cost basis and market or valuation basis of each classification of portfolio . 9 . Report any underwriting or public issue of securities by the sponsor , of a company any of whose securities were held by the investment trust within six months prior to such underwriting or public issue . 10 . Designate any items in the portfolio so as to show whether representatives of the sponsors or of the investment trust are represented on the board of directors of any company whose security is in the portfolio and , in addition , whether the sponsor has participated in a public offering of the security . 11 . Report in detail any special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of net profit or net loss for the quarter . 12 . Report per cent of total net asset value represented by government bonds and securities listed on New York Stock Exchange and New York Curb Exchange . Sees Room for Cooperation " We believe , " said Mr. Lehman , " that if the SEC should so desire the investment trust industry would cooperate fully with the commission in developing workable regulations and plans for reports , and , with the aid of a committee of experienced accountants , would cooperate in developing standard accounting principles to investment trusts . " This corporation has always been managed by an investment firm . Since suggestions have been made that brokers and firms engaged in the underwriting of securities be prohibited from sponsoring or managing investment trusts  --  to compel a separation between these two groups  --  we believe it is very appropriate now to deal with this phase of the problem . We firmly believe that such a suggestion does not strike at the root of the problem and is demonstrably against the best interests of the public . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could offer definite and special advantages to stockholders . Among , the reasons were : Long experience in handling substantial amounts of capital ; assurance of continuity of competent management ; practical experience as contrasted with purely academic knowledge in appraising companies , industries and their securities ; a group responsibility in judgments involving investment policies and , in many cases , a substantial ownership of the securities of the invest- ment trust , thus adding a real ownership interest . " Abuses possible in the case of investment-banker management , " continued Mr. Lehman , " are possible also in the case of any other type of management . There is always the possibility that the controlling individual may use the trust to ' unload , ' at a profit to himself , securities owned by him personally . Chance for Improper Actions " It is perfectly obvious that whoever controls an investment trust ? whether he is an investment banker or any one else  --  will , through the very fact of control of a substantial amount of money , be in a position to obtain benefits improperly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuses are possible under non-investment banker management . as well as under investment banker management . They involve the integrity and morality of individuals rather than of any specific profession or occupation . They can be controlled by appropriate legislation . " The most desirable method of eliminating the possibility of ' unloading ' is through regulation that requires complete disclosure of all direct transactions . Stockholders could then be relied upon to enforce their existing legal rights against controlling persons who have profited at their expense . " To summarize : Investmentbanker management offers extraordinary advantages to the investor . The investment bankers constitute the group best qualified to manage investment trusts . " They provide permanency and continuity of management . They provide wide experience in evaluating securities . They offer the most genuine guarantee of integrity available by linking up their own reputation with their responsibility for the trust . They have available at all times a large source of useful information which flows to them from their industrial associations and their broad interests . Their profession obliges them to regard not only national but international problems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Vice President on Stand Previously , Arthur H. Bunker , vice president of the Lehman Corporation , was introduced to the stand by Eustace Seligman , counsel for the Lehman Trust , and a partner of Sullivan &; Cromwell , a legal firm of New York . He was examined by L. M. C. Smith for the commission . Mr. Bunker stated that the trust had made five real estate loans aggregating $5,280,000 . Of this amount , $1,595,000 was written off and $2,509,000 is still on the books in the form of properties . The balance has been paid back . Mr. Bunker was followed on the stand by Monroe C. Gulman , another vice president of the Lehman Corporation , who was questioned regarding his firm 's participation in the formation of the Commercial National Bank . It was brought out that the bank started in January , 1929 , and the firm took 10,000 of the 70,000 shares of stock offered . The trust bought $1,200,000 worth of stock and by the end of 1935 its investment stood at $2,800,000 . " Bank stocks as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mr. Gulman . " The record for the Commercial National shows that it recovered 11 per cent better than the average for all bank stocks , if bought at the same time . " " The corporation , " he added , " held this bank stock over a longer period than any of its other bank shares because we had faith in the bank . This faith has been justified . Operations of the bank continue satisfactory , losses are fewer and I earnings better . " Underwritings Are Detailed John M. Hancock , Lehman partner , was examined on the syndicate and underwriting operations of the corporation . He furnished a summary of the schedules to the commission , which , including all underwriting in which the Lehman Corporation participated up to 1935 , showed a net profit of $476,010 . " If a separate calculation is made for the underwriting syndicate in which the Lehman Corporation participated , " said Mr. Hancock , ' " and of which Lehman Brothers were one of the managers , the net profit to the Lehman Corporation on such underwritings alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion from 1926-1935 , it was brought out by Mr. Smith , the examiner , that in twenty-threel of the twenty-six underwritings , the firm was a participant with the trust . A profit of $500 was model in International Match , while the underwriting profit in Fox Film in February , 1930 , was shown to be $331,000 . Explaining the operation , Mr. Hancock stated that BancamericaBlair and Lehman Corporation voted to buy 4,750 shares of Class A and 750,000 shares of Class B stock of Fox Film from a London syndicate . " Of the amount necessary , " said Mr. Hancock , " we agreed to put up $3,000,000 and the Wescp Corporation , a subsidiary of Fox Film , agreed to re-purchase the stock within forty-five days . We received 6 per dent interest on the money invested and a 10 per cent bonus . " Asked by the examiner to definethe workings of both the firm and the trust , Mr. Hancock said : " The primary purpose of the trust is to buy and hold securities , while the primary purpose of the firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
