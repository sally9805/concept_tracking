txt  | put a temporary check upon all their ambitions . Through the wide gap that lay between the Ural Mountains and the Caspian Sea , the salt-infested wilderness of the Ural River , thousands of little yellow men came trotting westward until at last it seemed as if Asia was to pour its entire population into the heart of Europe . The little Norse-Slavic principalities of the west were caught completely by surprise . In less than three years the whole of the Russian plain , rivers , seas , hills , were all of them in the hands of the Tartars , and it was only a matter of great good luck ( an epidemic among the Tartar ponies ) which saved Germany and France and the rest of western Europe from a similar fate . As soon as they had raised a new crop of horses , the Tartars once more tried their luck . But the bulwark of Germany and Bohemia held fast and the invaders , describing a wide circle , hacked and plundered and burned and murdered their way through Hungary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spoils of victory . During the next two centuries Christian men and women and children were forced to kneel in the dust whenever they met a descendant of the terrible Genghis Khan and kiss the stirrup of his horse or suffer the penalty of instant death . Europe heard of this , but Europe did not care . For the Slays worshipped God according to the Greek rites and western Europe worshipped God according to the rites of the Romans . Therefore , let the heathen rage and let the Russian people become the most abjectly miserable slaves that ever trembled at the crack of a foreign whip , for they were heretics and deserved no better fate . In the end , this indifference was to cost Europe very heavily , for those patient Russian shoulders , which accept whatever burden is put upon them by " those in power " , acquired that disastrous habit of unreasoning submission during the two and a half centuries of Tartar domination . Left to themselves , they would never have been able to throw off that terrible yoke . The rulers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post of the Slays in the east , were re-  | sponsible for setting their country free . In the year 148o , John III ( the Ivan the Great of Russian history ) refused to pay the annual tribute to the master of the Golden Horde . That was the beginning of open resistance . Half a century later , the foreign visitation came to an end . But although the Tartars disappeared , their system survived . The new rulers had a fine natural feeling for the " realities " of life . Some thirty years before , Constantinople had been captured by the Turks , and the last of the Eastern Roman Emperors had been killed on the steps of the church of the Holy Sofia . But he left a distant relative behind , a woman by the name of Zoe Palaeologa . She happened to be a Catholic . The Pope , seeing a chance of bringing the straying sheep of the Greek church back into his own fold , suggested a marriage between Ivan and Zoe . The wedding took place and Zoe changed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply laid plans of the Pope . Instead , Ivan grew more independent than ever . He realized that this was his opportunity to assume the role formerly played by the rulers of Byzantium . He adopted the coat-of-arms of Constantinople , the famous double-headed eagle , representing both the eastern and western Roman Empires . He made himself sacrosanct . He reduced his nobles to the rank of servants . He introduced the old strict etiquette of Byzantium at his own little court of Moscow . He played with the idea that he was now the only " Caesar " left in the world and his grandson , emboldened by the continued success of his house , finally proclaimed himself Emperor or Caesar of all the parts of Russia he was able to conquer . In the year 1598 the last descendant of the old Norse invaders , the last scion of the Rurik family , died . After fifteen years of civil war , a member of the Romanov family ? Moscow nobles of no particular consequence ? made himself Czar , and from then on the geography of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these Romanovs , who had many positive faults but a corresponding number of such very positive virtues that we may well overlook some of their failings . For one thing , they were all of them possessed of the fixed idea that no sacrifices were too great when it was a question of giving their subjects direct access to " open water " . They tried it in the south and hacked their way through to the Black Sea , to Azov and Sebastopol , only to find that the Turks cut them off from the Mediterranean . But these campaigns assured them the royal allegiance of the ten Cossack tribes , the descendants of the old Kazaki or free-booters , adventurers or runaway serfs who during the previous five centuries had fled into the wilderness to escape from their Polish or Tartar masters . They engaged in a war with the Swedes who had held practically all the territory around the Baltic since their successful participation in the Thirty Years War , and finally , after half a century of fighting , Czar Peter could order hundreds of thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him his new capital of St.  | Petersburg . But the Finnish Gulf was frozen over for four months of every year , and " open water " was as far off as ever . They followed the Onega River and the Dwina River right through the heart of the Tundra region ? the mossy plains of the Arctic ? and they built themselves a new city on the White Sea which they called after the Archangel Michael ; but the inhospitable Kanin peninsula was as far removed from Europe as the frozen shores of the Hudson Bay , and the Murman coast was carefully avoided by all Dutch and English skippers . The task seemed hopeless . There remained no other way out than to try the eastern route . In the year 1581 a band of runaway slaves and adventurers and prisoners of war from half a dozen European nations , all in all some sixteen hundred men , had crossed the Ural Mountains and , driven by necessity , had attacked the first Tartar Khan whom they met on their way east , the ruler of a region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had divided his possessions among themselves . But knowing that the arm of Moscow reached far , they had offered this territory to the Czar rather than await the day the troops of the Little Father should follow them to hang them as deserters and rebels , instead of rewarding them as true patriots who had contributed to the glory of their beloved sovereign . This strange method of colonization was kept up for almost a century and a half . The vast plain that lay stretched out before these " bad men " was sparsely populated . It was fertile . The northern half was prairie but the southern half was covered with woods . Soon they had left the river Ob behind them . Then the Yenisei was reached . As early as 1628 the advance-guard of this unsavory army of invasion reached the Lena and in 1639 they stood on the shores of the Sea of Okhotsk . Further towards the south they built their earliest fortress on Lake Baikal , shortly after the year 164o . They explored the Amur River in 1648 . In the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the Kolyma River in northern Siberia , had followed the shores of the Arctic Ocean until he reached the strait that sepa-  | rates Asia from America and had returned to tell the tale , which however attracted so little attention that when Vitus Bering , a Danish navigator in Russian employ , rediscovered these straits eighty years later he was permitted to give them his own name . From 1581 till 1648 is a period of 67 years . When you consider that it took our own ancestors about two centuries to cover the distance between the Alleghenies and the Pacific coast , it becomes evident that the Russians are not always as slow as we are sometimes led to believe . But not content with having added the whole of Siberia to their original holdings , the Russians finally crossed from Asia into America , and long before George Washington was carried to his grave , there was quite a thriving Russian colony around a fort called after the Archangel Gabriel , now known as Sitka , the town in which the formal transfer of rilaska from Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as energy and personal courage and reckless bravery Caption  | were concerned , these earliest Russian pioneers compared more than favorably with our own . But the Asiatic conception of Empire that still dominated the minds of those in power in Moscow and Petersburg prevented the normal development of a region where riches of every sort awaited the men who would know how to exploit them . Instead of developing the pastures and the forests and the mines , Russia turned Siberia into a gigantic jail . The first prisoners arrived during the middle of the seventeenth century , fifty years after Yermak had crossed the Urals , and they consisted of priests who refused to say mass according to the orthodox formula and who were therefore sent to the banks of the Amur to starve and freeze to death . Since then there has never been any interruption of that endless procession of men and women ( and ofttimes children ) who were being driven into the wilderness because their European sense of individualism had come into conflict with the Asiatic notion of conformity that was the basic law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these deportations was reached in the year 1863 , shortly after the last great Polish revolution when more than 50,000 Polish patriots were moved from the Vistula River to the neighborhood of Tomsk and Irkutsk . No precise statistics have ever been kept of the total number of these involuntary emigrants , but from t Boo to 1900 , when the system was slightly modified under heavy pressure from abroad , the mean annual average of exiles was about 20,000 . That , however , did not take into account the ordinary criminals , the murderers and petty thieves and pickpockets , who as often as not were shackled to men and women of great spiritual refinement whose only error consisted in loving their fellow-men more than they deserved . When their actual time of punishment had come to an end , t the survivors were given little pieces of land near one of the exile villages and were allowed to become independent farmers . On paper this was a marvellous scheme to get the country inhabited by white men , and it allowed the imperial government  | to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was sometimes painted ? that there was some system in all this Siberian madness ? the " criminal " was being educated to become a useful and productive member of society . In practice , however , it worked so well that the greater part of these socalled " free settlers " disappeared from the face of the earth without leaving trace of their whereabouts . Perhaps they went to live with one of the native tribes , became Mohammedans or heathen , and bade farewell to Christian civilization . Perhaps they tried to escape and were eaten by the wolves . We do n't know . Russian police statistics show that there were always between thirty and fifty thousand ex-convicts on the loose , hiding in the forest or the mountains , preferring any sort of hardship to the prison-yards of the Little White Father . But the imperial flag no longer flies over the Siberian bull-pen . It is now the flag of the Soviets . There has been a new deal . But the cards are the same , and they are of Tartar origin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barter and serfdom came to an end and was replaced by capitalism and industrialism is a matter of general knowledge . A few years before Lincoln signed the act of emancipation , the Russian serfs had been set free . In order to keep them alive , they were given a little bit of land , but never quite enough , and the land that was given unto the slave was taken away from the master . As a result , neither the master nor his former servant got enough to be able to pay his way . And all the time , foreign capital was reaching out after the hidden mineral treasures of the vast Russian plain . Railroads were built ? steamship lines were organized ? and European engineers waded through the mud of semi-Asiatic villages built around a replica of the Paris grand opera and asked themselves whether such things could be . That primitive barbaric strength that had given the founders of the Russian dynasty the courage to attempt the impossible had spent itself . A weak man , surrounded by priests and women , now sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pawned  | that throne to the money-lenders of London and Paris and accepted their terms which forced him to take part in a war that was abhorrent in the eyes of most of his subjects , he signed his own death-warrant . A little , bald-headed man , a graduate of the great Siberian school of exile , took hold of the ruin and began the work of reconstruction . He discarded the old European model and he discarded the old Asiatic model . He discarded everything old . He built ever with an eye for the future , but it was still the eye of the Tartar . What that future will be , we shall know a hundred years hence . Here it is sufficient if we give you a vague outline of the modern Soviet state , but only a very vague one , for the system is in a constant state of flux . The Bolshevists are engaged in an experiment , and they are as ruthless in discarding what proves impracticable as a chemist who suddenly realizes that he has been working according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from anything to which we ourselves have been accustomed these last five hundred years that it is difficult to reduce it to the usual European or American terminology of statecraft with its continual references to " representative government " and " democracy " and " the sacred rights of the minority " . These terms mean nothing to a youngster brought up in a Bolshevist school . He has never even heard of them , except as an example of the folly of his ancestors . In the first place , the Bolshevist conception of government is not based upon that rule of government of all the people , by all the people , for the benefit of all the people , which we teach our children as the most desirable ideal of statesmanship , whether we quite believe in it or not . Bolshevism recognizes only one class of society , that of the proletarians , the wage-earners , the workers , preferably those who work with their hands . And in order that this class may attain some of the good things of this world from which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruthless war upon all those who in any way could remind the  | people of the year 1932 of the old " bourgeois " or middle-class form of government which was based upon private profit and private gain . So far so good . Violent upheavals are nothing new in this world . Charles of England and Louis of France lost their heads a long time before Lenin was born . But when they died , a man , rather than a system , came to an end . When Nicholas II was murdered , it was not only a man but also the entire system this man had embodied and represented which was scrapped and which was forcibly removed from the Russian consciousness . The old account was closed and two little red lines were drawn at the bottom of the page . Then a fresh , new page was started and at the top of it appeared the name , " The Communist Party of Russia , Inc . " Now Communism as an economic system is nothing new . The old monastic orders were really communistic institutions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early Christian Church , which recognized neither rich nor poor and did not believe in private property . The Pilgrims , when they came to America , intended to form a communistic community . But all these efforts to bring about a more equitable division of this world 's goods had been conducted on a relatively small basis . They had never touched the lives of the people at large . And there is where the Bolshevist experiment differs from all others . It has turned the whole of the Russian plain from the Baltic to the Pacific into one vast political and economic laboratory where everybody is supposed to work for just one purpose ? the well-being and happiness of the mass , regardless of the present happiness and well-being of the individuals . But just as in the older days it was never quite possible for a Russian to rid himself of that duality of character which had been caused by the dual nature of his country , half-Asiatic and half-European , so the new Russian too is suffering from a conflict of enthusiasms which very frequently defeat their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society is undoubtedly of Europe= origin . The methods employed to put it into action  | are entirely Asiatic . Karl Marx and Genghis Khan have joined forces to bring about the Millennium and what will come of this extraordinary experiment I do not know . One prophecy is as good as the next . But already Bolshevism has accomplished certain results with which the rest of humanity will have to deal very seriously at the risk of seeing its own civilizations go to pieces . In the older days , Russia was ruled for the sole benefit of a small group of land-owners and supporters of the Czar , just as it had been in the days of the Tartars . It is still being ruled by a small group of people . But now they belong to the inner circle of the Communist party . They are fewer in number than the old-style nobility but even more devoted in their loyalty to the principle of autocracy . There is however a great difference between the dictatorship of the Czars and that of the Bolshevists . The small group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own benefit . They receive such wages as any American plumber or stevedore would sniff at , provided he happened to have work and was receiving any wages at all . And the truly gigantic energy developed by these new tyrants ( who are infinitely more ruthless than the Czar 's ministers ever dared to be ) is directed towards one single object ? to make everybody in the world work and to see to it that the workers , in exchange for their labors , are guaranteed enough food , enough living space and every possible opportunity for leisure of the more intelligent sort . To our western way of thinking , all this is about as topsyturvy as Einstein 's conception of a four or five dimensional universe . But one-seventh of all the land of this planet , a country three times as large as our United States , is now living under this system and it is making itself felt all over the world . It is not being preached by some poor little country like Norway or Switzerland , but by one of the richest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pious prayers and angry editorials will hardly upset it because the Russian people are completely cut off from the rest of the world , read very few foreign books ,  | never see any but strictly censored foreign newspapers , and might as well be living on the planet Mars for all they really know about their neighbors . The leaders , of course , are aware of the criticism that is levelled against them , but they do n't care . They are too busy doing other things , organizing their White Russian Republics and their Ukrainian Soviet Republic and their Trans-Caucasian Federation of Soviet Republics and their Kirghiz Soviet Republic and their Bashkir Republic and their Tartar Soviet Republics , to spend much time worrying about the approval and disapproval of that western world which they profess to regard as a pathetic historical revival , a nice exhibition for the museum of anti-religion , opened a year ago in the Czar 's former palace . Time will show us what is to become of this strange experiment , this Asiatic mysticism combined with the European sense of actuality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rest of the world would do well to take notice , for Bolshevism may be only a dream , but Russia is a fact .  | POLAND , THE COUNTRY THAT HAD ALWAYS SUFFERED FROM BEING A CORRIDOR AND THEREFORE NOW HAS A CORRIDOR OF ITS OWN POLAND suffers from two great natural disadvantages . Its geographic position is most unfortunate , and its nearest neighbors are its fellow-Slays of Russia . A real feeling of brotherhood is said to be a wonderful thing , but rarely as practiced between nations of a similar race . We do not know where the Poles originally came from . Like the Irish , whom they resemble in so many ways , the Poles are intensely patriotic , ever ready to die for their country , but rarely willing to live and work for it . The record of the valorous deeds of their ancestors , as compiled by their own leading historians , makes the earliest Polish heroes stow-aways on Noah 's Ark . But when the Poles are first mentioned in any reliable historical document , Charlemagne and his braves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some fifty years after the battle of Hastings , however , the word Poland began to mean something more than the name of a vague territory that was supposed to lie somewhere in the wilderness of the Far East . To the best of our present knowledge , the Poles lived originally near the mouth of the Danube , were set upon by invaders from the east , were forced to pull up stakes , and moved westward until they reached the Carpathian Mountains . They thereupon passed through the regions just evacuated by the other great branch of the Slavic race , the Russians , and finally found a safe place of refuge among the primeval forests and the marshes of that part of the great European plain which is situated between the Oder and the Vistula . They could not possibly have chosen a worse location . A man  | sitting on a chair in the middle of the main entrance to the Grand Central Station enjoys about as much quiet and privacy as a farmer in this territory , which is in reality the front door of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wanted to go west to conquer the European lands bordering on the North Sea , or those who wanted to go east to plunder Russia . The constant necessity of being prepared to fight on two fronts at the same time , gradually turned every Polish land-owner into a professional soldier and made every castle into a fortress . As a result , the military side of life was stressed at the expense of everything else . And commerce never took hold in a country where a state of war was the normal condition of life . There were a few towns but all of them were situated in the center of the country and along the banks of the Vistula . Krakow , in the south , has been built where the Carpathian Mountains dissolved themselves into the plains of Galicia . Warsaw , in the middle of the Polish plain , and Danzig , near the mouth of the river , depended for their business life on foreign merchants . Further inland , however , the country was almost empty , for there were no other rivers until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Kovno , the old capital of Lithuania , never grew beyond the status of a small princely residence . Such buying and selling as were absolutely necessary were in the hands of the Jews , who had fled to the outskirts of Europe when the Crusaders in their holy zeal had slaughtered the inmates of several of the better known ghettos of the Rhine region . A few hardy Norsemen , such as had founded the Russian state , might have done the country no end of good . But they never came to this part of the world . Why should they ? There was no convenient trade  --  route running north and south or east and west and there was no city of Constantinople at the other end of the long trail to reward them for the fatigue and the hardships of their trip . And so the Polish people were caught between the Germans , . who hated them because , although they were fellow-RomanCatholics , they also were Slays , and the Russians , who despised  | them because , although they were fellow-Slays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loathed them because they were both Christians and Slays . If the energetic Lithuanian dynasty , which did so much for the country during the days of the Middle Ages , had survived , things might have gone a great deal better , but in the year 1572 the Jagiellans died out and upon the death of the last king the nobles , grown rich during the many years of frontier fighting and enjoying almost despotic rights on their vast but isolated estates , succeeded in turning the country into an elective monarchy . That elective monarchy lasted from 1572 until 1791 and when it was destroyed , it had long since degenerated into a very painful joke . For the throne of Poland was simply sold to the highest bidder and no questions asked . Frenchmen and Hungarians and Swedes in turn were rulers of a kingdom which meant nothing to them except as a possible source of graft and revenue . When these monarchs omitted to surrender part of their spoils to their henchmen , the Polish nobles did what their Irish friends had done a thousand years before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them " get their rights " . Those neighbors , Prussia and Russia and Austria , were only too happy to oblige , and Poland ceased to exist as an independent nation . In 1795 , during the last of the three great divisions , Russia got 18o,00o square miles with 6,000,000 people . Austria got 45,000 square miles with 3,700,000 people , and Prussia got 57,000 square miles with 2,500,000 people . This hideous wrong was not undone until one hundred and twenty-five years later . And then the Allies , in their fear of Russia , went to another extreme . They not only made the new Polish Republic much larger than it had any right to be , but furthermore , in order to give Poland a direct outlet to the sea , they established the socalled " Polish Corridor " , a strip of land which runs from the old province of Posen to the Baltic Sea and which cuts Prussia into two parts which now have no longer any direct connection with each other .  | It takes no profound knowledge of either geography or history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridor . It will remain an object of hatred and distrust between Germany and Poland until either country shall have grown strong enough to destroy the other and then poor Poland will become once more what it has always been , a buffer-state between Russia and Europe . In the first flush of victory it seemed a glorious achievement . But building spite-fences across each other 's territory is not going to bring the economic and social problems of our time any nearer to their final solution .  | CZECHOSLOVAKIA , A PRODUCT OF THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES OF ALL the modern Slavic states , Czechoslovakia is by far the best situated from an economic point of view and in regard to the general state of culture of the majority of its cities . But it is an artificial state . It received its autonomy as a reward for having walked out on the Austrian Empire during the World War , and although it now consists of three parts , Bohemia , Moravia and Slovakia , it is hard to say whether it can survive all by itself . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second place , there is very little love lost between the Catholic Czechs and the Protestant Slovaks . The former , as part of the Germanspeaking Austrian Kingdom , had always been in direct contact with the rest of the world . Whereas the latter , badly administered by their Hungarian masters , had never risen very far above the status of mean little peasants . As for the Moravians , whose country , situated between Bohernia and Slovakia , contains by far the most fertile agricultural part of the entire Czechoslovakian commonwealth , it is politically quite insignificant , and therefore takes no part in the endless quarrels and feuds which have made the nine million Czechs treat the four million Slovaks in very much the same way as they were treated formerly by the Hungarians , whose respect for the rights of racial minorities is of very recent origin . Any one who wishes to study racial problems at their very worst is politely referred to central Europe . The situation is really quite hopeless . Czechoslovakia is not as bad as many other countries . But Czechoslovakia too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to hate each other and the problem is still further complicated by the presence of about three million Germans , the descendants of certain Teutonic immigrants who during the Middle Ages had moved to Bohemia to help M the development of the mineral riches of the Erzgebirge and the Bohmerwald . Finally in the year 1526 Bohemia had gone the way of all central European real estate and had been acquired by the house of Habsburg . During the next 388 years Bohemia had then been an Austrian colony . It had not been treated badly . German schools and German universities and German thoroughness of method had made the Czechs almost the only people of purely Slavic origin who had known how to work at a job with some steadiness of purpose . But no subject race has ever liked its masters because they treated them rather kindly and occasionally sent them a present for Christmas . And since revenge seems to be a perfectly natural instinct it need not surprise us that the Czechs , once they had gained their freedom , tried to turn the tables on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country and German became merely one of the tolerated dialects , like the Hungarian of Slovakia , and the new generation of Czech children was raised on a literary diet of strictly Czech origin . Which was no doubt magnificent from a patriotic point of view . But whereas formerly every Bohemian infant with his knowledge of German had been able to make himself understood to at least a hundred million people , he now finds himself restricted to the few million who speak Czech , and the moment he pokes his head outside of his own country , he is lost , for who is ever going to take the trouble to learn a language which has no commercial value and has no literature ? The Czech government , being composed of men high above the average of central European statesmanship , may gradually encourage a return to the old bilingual method . But they will have a hard time defending such a project against the professors of language who hate the idea of a universal tongue as a political demagogue loathes the prospect of a union of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich agricultural parts of the old Habsburg monarchy but was also a highly industrial province with its iron and coal and its world-renowned ability in the difficult art of glass-making . Furthermore , the industrious Czech peasants have always been very clever at home industries ( after twelve hours in the fields they must do something with their spare time ) and Bohemian textiles and Bohemian rugs and Bohemian shoes are famous all the world over . But the old territory into which these products could be imported free of duty ? one of the few but very concrete advantages of the Habsburg rule ? is now divided into half a dozen little principalities , each one of which has surrounded itself with heavily spiked tariff walls in order to ruin the other fellow 's business . Whereas formerly a car-load of beer could travel from Pilsen to Fiume without ever being stopped on the way for a customs examination or without paying a cent of duty , it now must change cars at half a dozen frontiers , is obliged to pay duty half a dozen times , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has long since turned sour ! Self-determination for small nations may be an excellent thing from an idealistic point of view , but it does not seem to work out so well when it comes in conflict with the natural lay of the landscape or the brutal necessities of economic life . But as long as the people of the year 1932 prefer to do their thinking in terms of 1432 , I do n't suppose that we can do anything about it . For the benefit of those who intend to travel in Czechoslovakia , I will add that Prague is no longer situated on the Moldau which runs eventually into the Elbe , but that Praha is located on the Vltava ; that Pilsen , where you went to drink beer , is now Plzen ( where you still go to drink beer ) ; and that those who did not drink but were tempted to overeat , no longer take a cure at Carlsbad but at Karlovy-Vary and that those who preferred Marienbad now patronize Marianske Lazne .

Of these three ethnical groups ( tribes sounds too much like African natives and might offend them ) the Serbs , who are the most important , live in the east along the banks of the Save which joins the Danube at a point where the capital Belgrade has been built .

Serbia ( the old habit is too strong ? hereafter when I write Serbia I really mean the Kingdom of the Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ) is essentially a Balkan state and its history is essentially that of a country subjected to five hundred years of Moslem slavery .

Unfortunately Dubrovnik offers no facilities to modern steamers . As for Fiume and Trieste , the natural outlets for Serbia , the Old Men of Versailles gave one of these cities to Italy and the other one she took for herself , although she really had no need for them as they would only compete with Venice , which aspired to regain its ancient and honorable position as mistress of the Adriatic .

Or it may send them by rail to Fiume , where the Italians of course do their best to ruin their Slavic competitors . In this respect , therefore , nothing has been changed since the days before the war when Serbia was kept a land-locked state at the instigation of the Austrian Empire . It is a bit sad to reflect that pigs were primarily responsible for the outbreak of that terrible disaster .

The Morava valley connecting with that of the Vardar River is a good enough trade-route which connects northern Europe with Saloniki on the Aegean Sea . It is really a branch of the great trunk lines connecting Nish ( the birthplace of Constantine the Great and the spot where ' Frederick Barbarossa , on his ill-fated expedition to the Holy Land , was entertained for a while by the famous Serbian Prince Stephen ) with Constantinople and Asia Minor . But , generally speaking , Serbia can not look forward to a great future as an industrial state . Like Bulgaria it will have to remain a nation of fairly prosperous Slavic farmers . Who has ever been able to compare a six-foot peasant from Skoplje ( or Uskub ) or Mitrovitsa to a cockney workman from Manchester or Sheffield will have some doubts whether such a fate is entirely without its compensations . Belgrade may forever remain an amiable little country town like Oslo or Bern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Birmingham or Chicago ? Perhaps it does . The modern soul is a strange thing and the Serbian peasant would not be the first to have his sound ancestral standard of values upset by the counterfeit cultural ideals of our Hollywood prophets.  | BULGARIA , THE SOUNDEST OF ALL BALKAN COUNTRIES , WHOSE BUTTERFLY-COLLECTING KING BET ON THE WRONG HORSE DURING THE GREAT WAR AND SUFFERED THE CONSEQUENCES THIS is the last of the little principalities that grew out of the great Slavic invasion of some twenty centuries ago . It would be more important in size and number of inhabitants if during the World War it had not taken what ultimately proved to be the wrong side . But such things will happen even in the best regulated nations . Better luck next time . On the Balkan peninsula , the " next time " , when speaking of war , means a dozen or half a dozen years hence . We are apt to speak in a slightly contemptuous manner of these half-civilized Balkan people who are forever fighting among each other . But do we ever realize with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloodshed and slavery and plunder and rape and arson the average Serbian or Bulgarian boy starts out upon his career through life ? Of the earliest inhabitants of Bulgaria we know nothing . We have found their skeletons , but skulls do not talk . Were they perhaps related to those mysterious Albanians , the Illyrians of Greek history , compatriots of the long-suffering Odysseus , that mysterious race which speaks a tongue unlike that of any other people on earth , who ever since the beginning of history have maintained themselves among the Dinaric Alps along the coast of the Adriatic and who today form an independent state , ruled over by a native tribal leader who made himself their legitimate sovereign as soon as a Vienna tailor had provided him with a nice , new uniform in which to hold court at Tirano , the new capital of a nation of 98% analphabets ? Or is this the home  | country of the Romani , who were also known as the Wlachs and who must have spread all over Europe as they also bestowed their name upon Wales and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better leave the solution of that puzzle to the philologists and confess that we do not know . But when we reach the era of the written chronicles , what endless invasions , wars and calamities ! There were , as I have already told you , two main routes leading from the gap between the Urals and the Caspian Sea to the west . One went northward of the Carpathians and led to the impenetrable forests of the northern European plain . The other followed the Danube and by means of the Brenner Pass carried the hungry savages to the heart of Italy . The Romans knew this and they therefore used the Balkans as their first line of defence against that " foreign scum " , as they were pleased to call those despised barbarians who eventually were to destroy them . Lack of soldiers gradually forced them to retreat to their own peninsula and leave the Balkan peoples to their fate . When the great migrations had come to an end , not a trace remained of the original Bulgarians . The Slays had assimilated them so completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survives in the Slavic dialect spoken by the so-called Bulgarians of today . The position however of the new conquerors was exceedingly precarious . In the south they had to deal with Byzantium , that eastern remnant of the Roman Empire which was Roman in name only but Greek in purpose and structure . From the north and the west they were forever threatened by raids on the part of the Hungarians and the Albanians . Next the Crusaders passed through their territory , an unholy army of holy men , the disinherited from all nations , ready to plunder Turk or Slav with equal ferocity . Finally the threat of an all-overpowering Turkish invasion and those last desperate appeals to Europe to come and protect the common soil of Christendom against the degrading touch of the infidel . And the sudden hush that spread through the land when fugitives from the Bosporus told how the Moslem Sultan had ridden his horse up the steps of Saint Sofia to  | desecrate the most holy of all the holy shrines of the Greek church . Followed by the panic when the reddening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turkish troops , marching westward through the blood-soaked valley of the Maritza . And thereafter four entire centuries of Turkish mis-rule . And then , at last , during the beginning of the last century , a first faint stirring of hope . A swineherd in Serbia started a rebellion that was to make him a king . Next that terrible war of extermination between Greek and Ottoman , turned into a major European issue by an English poet who hobbled to his welcome death in the pestiferous village of Missolonghi . And then the beginning of that great struggle for liberty which was to last for another hundred years . Let us be lenient in judging our Balkan friends . They have been the leading actors in the tragedy of man 's martyrdom . Among the modern Balkan states , Bulgaria is one of the most important . It is composed of two very fertile regions , both of them excellently suited to all sorts of agriculture : the plain in the north between the high ridge of the Balkan Mountains and the Danube , and the plain of Philippopolis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This valley , protected on both sides , enjoys a mild Mediterranean climate . It exports its products through the harbor of Burgas , just as the sterner products of the northern plain , grain and corn , are sent abroad by way of Varna . Otherwise there are very few towns , for the Bulgarians are essentially a peasant people . Sofia , the present capital , lies on the old trade-routes from north to south and east to west . For almost four hundred years it was the residence of the Turkish governors who , from their fortified palace on the Struma River , ruled the whole of the Balkan peninsula , with the exception of Bosnia and Greece . When Europe finally became conscious of the plight of its fellow-Christians , delivered to the mercies of the Moslem invaders , Mr. Gladstone 's constituents did a great deal of talking  | about the Bulgarian atrocities ; but the Russians were the first to take action . Twice their armies crossed the Balkan Mountains . The fighting to force the Shipka Pass and to subdue the fortress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there have been a few wars which were absolutely unavoidable , if the world was ever to progress from slavery to comparative freedom . As a result of the last of these Slavic relief-expeditions , the great Russo-Turkish conflict of 1877-1878 , Bulgaria was made an independent principality under a ruler of German origin . This meant that the patient and intelligent Bulgarian peasants got trained by people with a Teutonic sense of order . That may be responsible for the fact that today Bulgaria has the best schools of all the different Balkan states . The large land-owners have completely disappeared . The peasant owns his own land as he does in Denmark and in France . The illiteracy percentage has been sharply reduced and everybody works . It is a simple country of farmers and lumbermen . It is a veritable reservoir of physical endurance and energy . Like Serbia , it may never be able to compete with the industrialized states of western Europe . But it may still be there when the others are gone .  | ROUMANIA , A COUNTRY WHICH HAS OIL AND A ROYAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come to an end . But there exists one other Balkan state which none of us , however , is likely to forget , as it has a habit of crashing into the front pages of our newspapers with a frequency that is at times a bit painful . That is not the fault of the Roumanian peasants . They are born and till their fields and die very much as peasants are in the habit of doing all the world over . It is due to the incurable vulgarity and the unspeakable bad taste of that AngloGerman dynasty which thirty years ago succeeded the highly respectable Prince Charles of Hohenzollern on the throne of a kingdom founded by the grace of God , Prince Bismarck and a certain Benjamin Disraeli . It was in the year 1878 that these two gentlemen came together in Berlin and after paying their duties to the Deity decided to elevate Walachia ( the land of the Wlachs ) to the rank of an independent principality . If the present reigning family can ever be persuaded to remove itself to Paris , where people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as it is done with French soap , Roumania may go far , for Nature has been extraordinarily kind to this great plain between the Carpathians , the Transylvanian Alps and the Black Sea . Not only could it be turned into a granary as rich as that of the Russian Ukraine , of which it is the natural continuation , but the richest oil deposits of Europe are to be found near the city of Ploesci , where the Transylvanian Mountains join the plains of Walachia . Unfortunately , the farms both of Walachia and Bessarabia between the Danube and the Prut are in the hands of large landowners , most of them absentee landlords who spend their rev-  | enues in Bucharest , the capital , or in Paris , but never among the people whose labor makes them rich . As for the petroleum , the capital invested is usually owned abroad ; and the same is true of the iron deposits of Siebenbergen or Transylvania , the enormous complex of mountains taken away from Hungary and given to Roumania in exchange for the more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allies during the Great War . But as Transylvania had originally been part of the old Roman province of Dacia , and had been made part of Hungary as late as the twelfth century , and as the Hungarians had treated the Roumanians of Transylvania very much as the Roumanians of old Roumania treat the Hungarian minority of Transylvania today , we might just as well forget about it . These hopeless and intricate national puzzles can never be solved until every idea of nationalism shall have disappeared from the face of the earth . At the moment of going to press there seems to be little chance that such a miracle will happen . According to the latest available statistics , the former Kingdom of Roumania counted 5,500,000 Roumanians and 500,000 Gypsies , Jews , Bulgarians , Hungarians , Armenians and Greeks . The new Roumania , the so-called Greater Roumania , has 17 , - 000,000 inhabitants , of which 73% are Roumanians , r i % Hungarians , 4.8% Ukrainians , 4.3% Germans and 3.3% Russians in Bessarabia and the Dubrud j a , the land south of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislike each other most cordially , do not in any way belong to the same ethnographical stock , but happen to have been thrown together by the artificial decisions of a peace conference , the material is there for a first-rate civil war , unless the foreign creditors intervene to save their investments . Bismarck once said that the whole of the Balkans was not worth the bones of a single Pomeranian grenadier . One feels that in this , as in so many other things , the grouchy old founder of the last German Empire may have been right .  | HUNGARY , OR WHAT REMAINS OF IT THE Hungarians , or Magyars , as they prefer to call themselves , are very proud of the fact that they are the only people of Mongolian origin who were able to maintain themselves on European soil and to found a kingdom of their own , for their distant cousins , the Finns , were until very recently always a part of somebody else 's empire or kingdom . Perhaps the Hungarians in their present misery have stressed their great warlike qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can deny that as a bulwark against the Turks they have rendered a tremendously important service to the rest of Europe . The Pope recognized the value of this buffer state when he raised the Magyar chieftain , Stephen , to the rank of Apostolic King of Hungary . For when the Turks overran eastern Europe , it was Hungary which kept them within bounds . They were the first barrier , as Poland was to prove the second when Hungary at last was overrun . Under the leadership of one John Hunyadi , a humble nobleman of Vladic origin , Hungary became in truth one of the few defenders of the faith who was entitled to that name . But those same wide plains on both sides of the Tisia and Danube , which had so greatly attracted the Tartar horsemen that they had decided to settle down for good , were to prove the source of many internal evils . Wide open spaces make it comparatively easy for a few strong men to , dominate their neighbors . For where can the poor peasants go when there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of large land-owners . Far removed from the center of government , the land-owners maltreated their peasants so outrageously that soon the latter cared very little whether they were Magyar or Turk .  | When Sultan Suleiman the Great marched against the West in the year 1526 , the last of the Hungarian kings could not collect more than 25,000 men when he tried to stop the Mohammedans . On the plain of Mohacs this Hungarian army was completely annihilated . Twenty-four thousand out of a total of 25,000 perished . The King himself was killed , together with all his advisers , and more than 100,000 Hungarians were dragged back to Constantinople to be sold to the slave-dealers of Asia Minor . The greater part of Hungary was annexed to Turkey . The rest was occupied by the Austrian Habsburgs who then began a tug of war with the Mohammedans for the unhappy land until the beginning of the eighteenth century when all of Hungary became part of the Habsburg domains . Then , however , a new struggle for independence was started , the war against the German masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hungarians fought with reckless bravery , and at last they were able to achieve a semblance of independence by recognizing the Emperor of Austria as Apostolic King of Hungary , and acquiring the status of a dominion . But no sooner had they obtained what they considered merely to be their own good right than they must start upon a policy of persecution against all those who were not of Magyar blood . This policy was so short-sighted and deprived of common sense that soon they were without a friend in the whole wide world . They noticed this during the Congress of Versailles , when the number of inhabitants of the ancient Apostolic kingdom was reduced from 21,000,000 to 8,000,000 and three-fourths of all its former territory bestowed upon deserving neighbors . This left Hungary a mere shadow of its old glorious self , a state not unlike Austria , one big city without any hinterland . Hungary was never very much of an industrial country . The large land-owners had had a prejudice against those ungainly chimneys that are an indispensable part of all well-regulated factories and they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result the Hungarian plain remained available for the purposes of agriculture , and Hungary today has the highest percentage of  | agricultural land of any country . Since most of this has always been under cultivation , the people should have been comparatively well off ; yet the prevailing poverty has been so great that between 1896 and 1910 the country lost almost a million inhabitants through emigration . As for the subject races of the old kingdom , the Magyar minority knew so well how to make its subjects uncomfortable that they too moved away by the boatload and the trainful , to help in the development of our own nation . We may as well give you a few figures , for what happened in Hungary happened to a lesser extent in practically all those countries where a small class of hereditary landlords had succeeded in making themselves supreme . Just before the beginning of the Turkish wars of the sixteenth century , the Hungarian plain was densely populated and had more than 5,000,000 inhabitants . The Turkish domination reduced that number to 3,000,000 in a little less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turks away from the Puszta ( the Magyar name for the plains ) , Hungary was so sparsely populated that immigrants from all over central Europe hastened to occupy the deserted farms . But the Magyar nobles , considering themselves the dominant race , the fighting race par excellence , would grant unto those newcomers none of the rights which they themselves enjoyed . The subject races , therefore , who accounted for almost one-half of the total population never were able to feel any real affection towards their adopted country . Was it any wonder that during the Great War they felt a lack of inner loyalty which in the end caused the dual monarchy to crumble to dust , like an old building shaken by an earth-quake ?  | FINLAND , ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WHAT HARD WORK AND INTELLIGENCE CAN ACHIEVE AMID HOSTILE NATURAL SURROUNDINGS THERE only remains one more country before we leave Europe . Turkey today retains little of her former European possessions except Constantinople and a small slice of the Thracian plain and we had therefore better save our Turkey for tomorrow . But the Finns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They used to live all over Russia , but the more numerous Slays pushed them northward until they reached that strip of dry land which connects Russia with Scandinavia . There they settled down , and there they have been ever since . The few Lapps who were living in the forests offered no difficulties , for they moved to Lapland in the Scandinavian peninsula , and were contented to give European civilization a wide berth . As for Finland , it is unlike any other country in Europe . For tens of thousands of years it had been covered by glaciers . These have scraped the original soil so completely away that today only ten percent of the land is fit for cultivation . The moraines of the glaciers , the stones and the dirt carried down by these slow-running rivers of ice had filled up the ends of a great many valleys . When the great thaw set in , these valleys were filled with water , and that was the origin of those endless mountain lakes with which Finland is dotted . The word " mountain lake " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another Switzerland , for Finland is a low country and rarely rises above a height of 500 feet . The number of these lakes is around 40,000 . Together with the marshland that stretches between them , they occupy 30% of the total area of the state . They are entirely sur-  | rounded by those valuable forests which cover 62% or twothirds of the total area and which provide the greater part of the world with the woodpulp necessary for the manufacture of books and magazines . Part of this wood is manufactured into paper on the spot . But Finland has no coal . It has enough fastrunning rivers to be able to develop some water-power . But the climate , which is not unlike that of Sweden , turns these rivers into ice for five months of every year , and then the power stations are , of course , unable to function . The wood therefore has to be carried away by ships . Helsinki ( Helsingfors until the late war ) is not only the political capital but also the chief exportharbor for Finnish lumber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your attention to an interesting object lesson of what education may do for a people . The granite bridge connecting Scandinavia with Russia was entirely inhabited by people of Mongolian origin . But the western half , the so-called Finnish half , was conquered by the Swedes while the eastern half , inhabited by the Karelians , became Russian territory . After five centuries of Swedish influence and domination , the Finns of the east had become a civilized European nation , superior in many ways to several countries which enjoyed a much better geographical situation . But the Karelians , after an equally long period under the rule of the Russians , who some day hoped to exploit the riches of the Kola peninsula and the Murmansk coast , were exactly where they had been when the Muscovite Czars first insisted upon their submission . Whereas in Finland proper , which did not get in touch with Slavic culture until the year 1809 when Sweden lost this province to Russia , the number of analphabets is one percent , it is 97% in Karelia , which has always been under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and probably have the same natural ability for spelling c-a-t cat and t-a-i-1 tail .  | THE DISCOVERY OF ASIA Two thousand years ago the Greek geographers were fighting among themselves about the original meaning of the word Asia . So there is no use in trying to solve the problem today . The theory that the word Ereb or " darkness " was the name which the sailors from Asia Minor had bestowed upon the land in the west where the sun went down and Acu or " glorious " upon the land in the east where the sun arose seems to be as good or as bad as any other . Then we come to the next point , which is of greater importance . How and when did the people of Europe begin to suspect that they were not the center of the world ? That their own home was but the small peninsula of an infinitely larger piece of land inhabited by ever so many more people , many of whom enjoyed a much higher degree of civilization , so that the Trojan heroes were fighting each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese had long since placed them in their museums of obsolete historical curiosities ? Usually Marco Polo is mentioned as the first European to visit Asia , but there had been others before him , although we know very little definite about them . As has happened so often in the realm of geography , it was war rather than peace which widened our knowledge of the Asiatic map . The chance to do business with the people over seas made the Greeks familiar with Asia Minor . The Trojan war was not without its educational side . The three great Persian expeditions against the west helped matters along very nicely . I doubt whether the Persians knew where they were going . Did the Greeks mean much more to them than the Indians of the west meant to General Braddock when  | ne moved into the wilderness to attack Fort Duquesne ? I doubt it . The return visit of Alexander the Great , a couple of centuries later , was already something more than a mere military campaign , and Europe got its first scientific ideas about the territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romans were by far too much pleased with themselves to take a really serious interest in " foreign " lands . As a source of revenue , to allow them to live a more luxurious existence at  | home , all foreign countries were grist to their mill . But the people whom they administered meant nothing to them whatsoever . Provided they paid their taxes and worked on the roads , they could live and die and quarrel among themselves as they pleased . They never even tried to understand what happened around them . In a crisis they called for the guards , did enough shooting to reestablish order , and washed their hands of the whole affair . Pontius Pilate was neither a weakling nor a scoundrel . He was merely a typical Roman colonial administrator with a good record for " regularity " and highly commended by those at home for his beautiful ignorance about the natives entrusted to his care . Once in a while some queer person like Marcus Aurelius would come to the throne , who derived a positive pleasure from sending a diplomatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East . When they returned and told of the strange things they had seen , they were a seven days ' wonder . Then the Roman mob tired of them and went back to the exciting daily shows of the Colosseum . The Crusades taught Europe a few things about Asia Minor , Palestine and Egypt , but the world continued to end on the eastern shores of the Dead Sea . The story which finally made Europe " Asia-conscious " was not the result of a serious " scientific " expedition , but was due to the labors of a hack-writer who had never set eyes upon the countries of which he wrote , a poor penny-a-liner looking for a subject that might prove popular . The father and uncle of Marco Polo were Venetian merchants whose business dealings had brought them into contact with Kublai Khan , the grandson of Genghis Khan . Kublai Khan happened to be a man of great intelligence who thought that his people would be benefited by the introduction of a certain amount of western efficiency . He had heard that two Venetians occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Syr-Darya at the foot of the Altai Mountains . He invited them to come to Peking . They went and were  | received with great honors . After several years they decided that their families needed them . The Khan bade them go home for a while and return and bring their bright young son and nephew Marco , about whom they had been talking so much . In the year r275 , after a trip of three and a half years , the Polo family returned to Peking . Young Marco was all he had been said to be . He became a favorite at the court of Peking , was made governor of a province , received titles and honors , but after two dozen years he got homesick and so returned to Venice by way of India ( he did that part of the voyage on ship-board ) and Persia and Syria . His neighbors , not in the least interested in tall stories , nicknamed him Marco Millions , for he was forever telling them how rich the Khan was and how many golden statues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many silken gowns the concubines of such and such a prime-minister owned . Why should they believe such yarns , when it was well-known that even the wife of the Emperor of Constantinople had only a single pair of silk stockings ? And Marco Millions might have died and his story might have died with him if Venice and Genoa had not engaged in one of their little quarrels just then , and if Marco , as commander of a Venetian galley , had not been taken prisoner by the victorious Genoese . He remained in prison for a year , sharing his cell with a citizen from Pisa by the name of Rusticiano . This Rusticiano had had some experience as a writer . He had popularized a number of Arthurian tales and cheap French novels , the Nick Carter stuff of the Middle Ages . He quickly recognized the publicity value of the great Polo story , and during their time in jail he pumped Marco dry for information . Taking down everything Marco told him , he gave the world a book which is read quite as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century . What probably gave the book its success was its constant references to gold and to riches of all sorts . The Romans and the Greeks had vaguely spoken of the opulence of eastern potentates  | but Polo had been on the spot , had seen all these things with his own eyes . The efforts to find a short-cut to the Indies really date from that time . But the task was difficult . Finally in 1498 the Portuguese got as far as the Cape of Good Hope . Ten years later they were in India . Forty years later they were in Japan . Meanwhile Magellan , coming from the east , had reached the Philippine Islands , and by that time the exploitation of southern Asia was in full swing . So much for the general outline . How Siberia was discovered , I have already told . The first visitors to the other countries will be given honorable mention when we get to them .  | WHAT ASIA HAS MEANT TO THE REST OF THE WORLD EUROPE gave us our civilization but Asia gave us our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world the three great monotheistic religions which now dominate mankind . Judaism , Christianity and Mohammedanism are all of Asiatic origin . It is curious to reflect that when the Inquisitioners were burning their Jews , both the executioners and their victims were appealing to deities of Asiatic origin ; that when the Crusaders were killing the Mohammedans and vice versa , it was a conflict of two Asiatic creeds which bade them do murder upon each other ; and that whenever a Christian missionary gets into a dispute with a follower of Confucius , the two are merely engaged in a purely Asiatic exchange of opinions . But Asia did not only give us our religious beliefs . It also gave us the fundamentals upon which we have constructed the entire fabric of civilization . In the pride of our recent technical inventions , we may loudly boast of " our great western progress " ( we occasionally do ) , but that much vaunted progress of the west is merely a continuation of the progress that was begun in the east . It is highly doubtful whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it had not learned the rudiments of everything it knows in the schools of the east . The knowledge of the Greeks was not the result of cerebral spontaneous combustion . Mathematics and astronomy and architecture and medicine did not , like Pallas Athene , jump forth from the head of Zeus , armed from head to foot , ready for the glorious battle upon human stupidity . They were the result of slow and painful and deliberate growth , and the real pioneering work was done along the banks of the Euphrates and the Tigris .  | From Babylon the arts and sciences then travelled to Africa . Here the dark-skinned Egyptians took them in hand until the Greeks had at last reached a sufficiently high degree of civilization to appreciate the beauty of a geometrical problem and the loveliness of a perfectly balanced equation . From that moment on , we can speak of a truly " European " science . But that truly " European " science had had an Asiatic ancestor who had lived and prospered more than 2000 years before . And Asia bestowed further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the cat and the useful quadrupeds , the docile cow and the faithful horse , together with the sheep and the hog , were all of them of Asiatic origin . When we think of the role played by these useful creatures during the era before the invention of the steam-engine , we begin to realize the debt we owe to Asia . To which we must add the greater part of our billof-fare , for practically all of our fruits and vegetables , most of our flowers and practically all of our poultry is of Asiatic origin and was brought to Europe by the Greeks , the Romans or the Crusaders . Asia , however , was not always a Lady Bountiful from the east , carrying rich blessings from the banks of the Ganges and the Yellow River to the poor barbarians of the west . Asia could also be a terrible taskmaster . The Huns , who during the fifth century ravaged central Europe , were of Asiatic origin . The Tartars , who followed them seven centuries later and turned Russia into an Asiatic dependency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hailed from the desert regions of central Asia . The Turks , who during five long centuries caused so much bloodshed and misery and made eastern Europe into what it is today , were an Asiatic tribe . And another hundred years may see a united Asia once more upon the warpath and eager to repay us for some of the things we have done to her children since Berthold Schwartz invented his gunpowder .  | THE CENTRAL ASIATIC HIGHLANDS THE 17,000,000 square miles of Asia are divided into five unequal parts . First of all , and nearest to the Arctic , lies the great plain which I have already mentioned when I spoke of Russia . Next come the central highlands . Then the high plateaus of the south-west . Next the peninsulas of the south ; and finally the peninsulas of the east . As I have already described the great Arctic plain , I can continue at once with the second part of the program . The central Asiatic highlands begin rather mildly with a series of low mountain chains which form more or less parallel lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north-west , but never from north to south . In many places , however , the crust of the earth has been badly broken and twisted and folded and tortured by great volcanic upheavals . Thus we get the irregular contours of the Yablonoi Mountains east of Lake Baikal , the Khangai and Altai Mountains west of Baikal , and the Tien-shan Mountains just east of the Balkash Lake . To the west of these mountains are the plains . To the east lies the high plateau of Mongolia where the Gobi desert is situated , the home of the ancestors of Genghis Khan . West of the Gobi desert lies the slightly lower plateau of east Turkestan . It is the valley of the Pamir River , which aimlessly loses itself in the nearby lake of Lob-nor , famous through the discoveries of the Swedish traveller , Sven Hedin . On the map the Pamir looks like a small desert brook . Yet it is one and a half times as long as the Rhine . For remember , Asia is the country of the gigantic proportions . Just north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Tien-shan Mountains . It is the land mentioned on our atlases as Jungaria , and it leads up to the Khirgiz steppes . It consists of an enormous valley which was the gateway through which all the desert tribes , the Huns , the Tartars and the Turks , started upon their marauding expeditions against Europe . South of the Tarim basin , due south-west to be more accurate , the landscape becomes exceedingly complicated . The Tarim basin is cut off from the valley of the Oxus or the Amu-Darya ( which loses itself in the Aral Sea ) by a high plateau , the Plateau of Pamir , also called the Roof of the World . The Pamir Mountains , already known to the Greeks , were on the direct route from Asia Minor and Mesopotamia to China . They were a good deal of a barrier but could be crossed by a number of mountain passes . These passes average between 15,000 and 16,000 feet in height . Remember that Mount Ranier is only a little over 14,000 feet high , Mont Blanc a little over 15,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory where the passes lie at a higher altitude than the highest mountain tops of America and Europe , where the mountains themselves therefore dwarf anything we ourselves have to offer in the shape of crinkled globe-crust . But the Pamir plateau is merely a beginning . It is a sort of terminal from which the big mountain-ranges radiate in all directions . There is the Tien-shan range , which I have already mentioned , running northward . There is the Kuen-lun range , which cuts Tibet off from the Tarim basin . There is the Karakoram , which is short but very , very steep ; and finally we have the Himalaya range , which in the south cuts Tibet off from India and which breaks all records for " highest above sea-level " , with altitudes of more than 29,000 feet or over five and one half miles , reached by both Everest and Kanchanjanga . As for the plateau of Tibet , with an average height of 15,000 feet , it is indeed the most elevated country in the whole world . The Bolivian plateau in South America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically uninhabited , whereas Tibet , which covers an area equal to two-fifths of that of Russia , has a population of almost two million people .  | This shows to what extremes of air-pressure the human body can accustom itself . Those Americans who have crossed the Rio Grande know the discomforts they experience when they are allowed to spend a few days in the delightful Mexican capital which is only 7400 feet high . They are warned beforehand not to hustle as they do at home , and to take it easy until their heart The High Plateau of Tibet ceases to pump like a sledgehammer whenever they walk half a block . The Tibetans not only walk a hundred blocks in a day but they carry everything the country needs on their backs across mountain passes which are quite frequently too steep for mules and horses but which are the only connection they have with the outside world . Although Tibet is about sixty miles further south than the semi-tropical island of Sicily , the snow remains on the ground - cor at least six months of every year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevertheless , this high plateau with its terrible wind storms , raging across the bleak salt-bogs of the south , its dust and snow and general discomforts of living ,  | has become the home of an exceedingly curious religious experiment . During the seventh century , Tibet was merely a principality like so many other Asiatic states , ruled over by a king who lived in Lhasa , the City of God . One of these kings was converted to Buddhism by his Chinese wife . Since that day , Buddhism has flourished in Tibet as nowhere else in Asia . Lhasa is to the Buddhists what Rome is to the Catholics , or Mecca to the Mohammedans ? the holy of holies . The Buddhism of Tibet is not the pure original doctrine of the gentle Indian prince who lived and died six centuries before the birth of Christ . It is the usual degenerate form , full of devils and spooks , and it has forgotten a great many of the noble teachings of the founder of that great Asiatic faith . But Tibet has been a bulwark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that religion against the attacks of the Mohammedans from the west and the pagan creeds of southern India . Its uninterrupted success may in part have been the result of a very extraordinary arrangement which that church provides for an almost automatic continuation of the institution of the Buddhistic papacy . The Buddhists have always believed in the reincarnation of the soul . It follows that the soul of Gotama himself must continue somewhere on this earth . All that was necessary was to find him and make him head of all the faithful . Now it is well to remember that Christianity , which is so much younger than Buddhism , has a great many ideas and institutions in common with its old neighbor and rival . Pious Buddhists were in the habit of eschewing the Devil and the flesh long before John the Baptist retired into the wilderness . Their monks practiced celibacy , poverty and chastity ages before Saint Simeon climbed to the top of his pillar in the valley of the Nile . They also exercised high political functions . During the reign of Kublai Khan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buddhism , the abbots of an important Tibetan monastery were recognized as the political rulers of all Tibet . In return for this favor , the new Dalai Lama , in his quality of spiritual over-lord of the  | whole Buddhist world , officially crowned the Tartar Khan Emperor of Mongolia , just as Pope Leo III had crowned Charlemagne . In order to keep the dignity of Lama ( or superior spiritual ruler ) in the same family , the first Lamas broke the rules of celibacy and remained married until they had begotten a son to succeed them . But during the fourteenth century a great reformer arose among the Tibetan monks , a sort of Martin Luther of Buddhism . When he died , the old monastic orders had been reestablished in all their former rigor and their head , the Dalai Lama , " the Lama as big as the ocean " , was once more recognized as their spiritual shepherd by one-quarter of all the people on earth . He was to be assisted in his task by the Pantshen Lama or Glorious Teacher , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of succession , which was then introduced , has never been changed . When either the Dalai Lama or the Pantshen Lama dies , the survivor sends for a list of all the male children born in Tibet immediately after the demise of his colleague , for the spirit of the dead man must now live in one of those babies . After prolonged prayers , three names are chosen , and these names are written on slips of paper . These are then thrown in a golden casket , provided several centuries ago for the occasion by one of the Chinese emperors . Then the abbots of all the great monasteries of Tibet gather together in the immense palace of the Dalai Lama . There are 3000 such monasteries in the country , but only a few are big enough to send delegates to this Buddhistic college of cardinals . After a week of fasting and praying , they draw one name out of the golden casket . The child who bears that name is held to be the reincarnation of the Buddha and is surrendered to the monks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very happy one . It is to the advantage of the powerful abbots to keep him in the background and to make him a weakling , so that he may do their bidding and let them live comfortably at the expense of the other five-sixths of the populace , who are not monks but who are engaged in some productive labor and must therefore support their spiritual mentors . Should  | the poor youngster prove " difficult " , then there are several subtle ways and means to allow him to " return to Paradise " . Does he come up to the just expectations of his tutors , then he leads a terribly dull and monotonous existence and dies young anyway from sheer lack of exercise and boredom . Nevertheless and notwithstanding , the system continues . Systems of that sort always do , whether 12,000 feet up in the air Caption or at sea-level . As for the mountain-ranges which protect Tibet against the neighbors from the south and which protect it so well that until only a few years ago no foreigner had set foot upon this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred years , these mountain-ranges are so much in the public prints that they are better known and to a larger number of people than the mountains of Vermont . For our time , which loves records , has cast an envious eye upon the last remaining mountain top of any importance that remains unsealed . Mount Everest was called after the colonel of engineers who brought this part of the Himalayas into maps for the English geodetic survey , some time during the middle of the last century . It is 29,000 feet  | high , which makes it just twice as high as Mount Ranier . It has defied all attempts of man to reach the summit . The last of the great Everest expeditions in 1924 got to within a few hundred yards of the top . Two men volunteered to make the final climb . Armed with oxygen apparatus , they bade farewell to the rest of the party . They were last observed when they were within 600 feet of the final pinnacle . After that , they were never seen again . Mount Everest remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region . Being situated in the heart of Asia , the country of the Gigantic Dimensions , the mountains must of course assume proportions compared to which the Swiss Alps become little sand piles made by boys and girls playing along the sea-shore . In the first place , these mountains of eternal snow , as the Hindus call them , are almost twice as wide as the Alps and cover thirteen times more territory . Some of their glaciers are four times as long as the most important glacier of Switzerland . There are forty individual moun tain tops of more than 22,000 feet height and several of the mountain passes are more than twice as high as those of the Alps . Like all other parts of the Great Fold which runs all the way from Spain to New Zealand , the Himalayas are of comparatively recent date ( even younger than the Alps ) and count their age in millions of years and not in hundreds of millions . It will take a great deal of sunshine and rain to destroy them and reduce them to flat country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formations , are busily engaged . Already the Himalayas are cut into irregular pieces by the deep ravines of half a hundred brooks and rivers . The Indus , the Ganges and the Brahmaputra , the three most important rivers of India , help this labor of disintegration along at a merry clip . Politically speaking , too , the Himalayas , with their tremendous length of 1 500 miles , offer a more diversified spectacle than any other mountain-range . For they are not merely the natural frontier between two adjoining countries , as are the Alps and the Pyrenees . They happen to be so wide that quite a number of independent states are tucked away in them . Some of  | these , like Nepal , the home of the famous Gurkhas , who have retained a certain degree of independence , are four times as large as the republic of Switzerland and have almost 6,000,00o inhabitants . Others , like Kashmir ( where our grandmothers got their shawls and where the English recruit their famous Sikh regiments ) , which is now part of the British domains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a population of over 3,000,000 . Finally , if you will look once more at the map , you will see a curious thing in regard to two of the big rivers , the Indus and the Brahmaputra . They do not run down from the Himalayas the way the Rhine runs down from the Alps , or the Missouri runs down from the Rockies . Instead they take their rise behind the main chain of the Himalayas . The Indus originates between the Himalayas and the Karakoram ridge . The Brahmaputra flows first from west to east through the plateau of Tibet . Then it makes a sharp turn and starts upon that short voyage from east to west to join the Ganges which runs through the heart of the broad valley between the Himalayas and the plateau of Deccan , in the central part of the Indian peninsula . Running water , of course , has a terrific erosive power , but it does not seem likely that these two rivers could have dug their way through the Himalayas if they had begun to flow after the mountains had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conclusion that these rivers must be older than the mountains . The Indus and the Brahmaputra were there before the crust of the earth began to heave and groan and very slowly produced those gigantic folds which were to become the highest mountain ranges of the modern world . But their growth was so slow ( time is after all only an invention of man , eternity is timeless ) that the rivers , by dint of their erosive energies , managed to remain on the ground floor , so to speak . There are geologists who claim that even now the Himalayas are still gaining . Since the thin concrete shell on which we live contracts and expands like the skin of our body , these geologists maybe right . The Swiss Alps , as we know for a fact , are travelling  | slowly from east to west . The Himalayas , like the Andes of South America , may be moving upward . There is only one law in the laboratory of Nature which holds good for all creation ? there must be constant change and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p 300 THE GREAT WESTERN PLATEAU OF ASIA FROM Pamir in the center a wide mountain-range , which is really nothing but a series of high plateaus , runs due west until at last it is stopped by the waters of the Black Sea and the Aegean . All of these plateaus have familiar names , for they have played a most important role in the history of human progress . I might go a little further and say the most important role . For unless all our present ethnological speculations are wrong , these highlands and valleys between the Indus river and the shores of the eastern Mediterranean were not only the nursery which hatched that branch of the human race to which we ourselves happen to belong , but they also acted as a sort of grammar school in which we learned the rudiments of those sciences and the first principles of those moral tenets which eventually were to set Man apart from the rest of the animal world . In order of their succession , the first of these highlands is the plateau of Iran . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by high mountain-ranges . Even in the north where it borders upon the Caspian Sea and the Turanian desert and in the south where it borders upon the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea , there is not a sufficient amount of rainfall to let this region have a single river worth the name . Baluchistan , separated from India proper by the high Kirthar range , and since 1887 part of the British domains , has a few indifferent streams which lose themselves into the Indus river , but its deserts have been feared ever since a greater part of Alexander 's armies perished there from thirst on the way back from India . Afghanistan , which was so much in the limelight a few years ago when it fell into the hands of a ruler who tried to publicize  | himself and his country by a very spectacular trip through Europe , has a river , the Helmund . This begins in the Hindu Kush , one of the high mountain-ranges that radiate southward from Pamir and which loses itself in the salty Lake of Seistan on the border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much better climate than Baluchistan and in many other ways this country is of much greater importance . The original trade-route between India and northern Asia and Europe ran through the heart of this country . It went from Peshawar , the capital of the north-west frontier province , to Kabul , the capital of Afghanistan , by way of the famous Khyber Pass , and then crossed the high Afghan plateau until it reached Herat in the west . About fifty years ago Russia and England began their fight for the ultimate control of this buffer state . As the Afghans happened to be excellent fighting men , those peaceful penetrations from south and north had to be accomplished with more than the usual care and circumspection . The disaster of the first Afghan war of 1838-1842 , when a mere handful of English returned to tell how all the others had been massacred during the attempt to force an unpopular ruler upon the unwilling Afghan people , was never quite forgotten ; and thereafter England proceeded across the Khyber Pass with careful tread . But when the Russians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Tashkend and Samarkand , the English from their side were forced to make some move lest they wake up one morning to hear the armies of the Czar doing a little practice shooting on the other side of the Suliman Mountains . And so , while His Imperial Majesty 's representatives in London and Her Royal Majesty 's representatives in St. Petersburg were assuring the respective imperial and royal governments that their intentions towards Afghanistan were wholly unselfish and of a most respectable and laudatory nature , the engineers of both governments were working on elaborate plans to bless poor Afghanistan , " cut off by cruel Nature from direct access to the sea " , with a railroad system that should henceforth allow the benighted Afghans to  | partake at first hand of the blessings of western civilization . The World War unfortunately interfered with these projects . The Russians got as far as Herat , from where today you may travel by rail via Mery in the Turkoman Socialist Soviet Republic to the harbor of Krasnovodsk on the Caspian Sea and thence by boat to Baku and western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bokhara to Kokand in the Uzbeg Republic and is to continue from there to Balkh . Balkh is at present a thirdrate village , situated among the vast ruins of that ancient Bactria which 3000 years ago was as important as Paris is today . It was the original center of that highly ethical religious movement started by Zoroaster ( or Zarathustra ) which not only conquered Persia and penetrated as far as the Mediterranean , but which in a modified form was so popular among the Romans that for a long time it was one of the most serious rivals of Christianity . England meanwhile has been pushing her railroad from Hyderabad to Quetta in Baluchistan , and from there to Kandahar , where in the year 188o the British had avenged themselves for their defeat of the first Afghan war . But there is still another part of the Iranian plateau which deserves some attention . Today it is merely the shadow of its former greatness but it must have been an extraordinarily interesting land when the name of Persia stood for all that was most excellent in painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of living . The first period of glory came six centuries before Christ , when Persia was the center of an empire which reached all the way from Macedonia to India . This was destroyed by Alexander , but five hundred years later , under the dynasty of the Sassanids , the Persians restored the ancient realm of Xerxes and Cambyses . They restored the Zoroastrian faith in all its former purity , collected the sacred writings into one volume , the famous Zend-Avesta , and made the desert flower with the roses of Ispahan . Early during the seventh century the Arabs conquered Persia and Mohammed defeated Zoroaster . But if it is true that one Caption  | shall know a country by its literature , then the works of Omar , the tent-maker 's son from Nishapur , bear witness to the exquisite taste that flourished once upon a time in these desert lands between Kurdistan and Khorasan . A professor of mathematics , dividing his time between algebra and quatrains upon the delights of love and the beauties of old red wine , is a phenomenon of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have tolerated his presence in the hallowed halls of pedagogy . Today 's interest however in Persia is of a more prosaic nature . The country has oil , and that is about the worst thing that could possibly happen to a nation too weak to defend its own interests . Theoretically speaking , the natives of any given place are supposed to be the chief beneficiaries of the treasures that lie hidden beneath their ancestral grave-yards . In practice it works out differently . A few of the Sultan 's intimate friends in far away Teheran grow rich from granting concessions , and several thousand men and women living near the wells may find occasional employment at pretty meagre wages . But the rest goes to the foreign investor who thinks that Persia is the name of a rug . Unfortunately , Persia seems to be one of those countries which will always be poor and badly administered . Its geographical location is very little of a blessing and very much of a curse . It is a desert , but when a desert is situated on the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge connecting two of the most important parts of the world , then that desert will forever be a battle-field and a bone of contention between opposing interests . And what I have just said of Persia holds true of this entire western part of Asia . The final highlands in the chain of plateaus that run all the way from Pamir to the Mediterranean are Armenia and Asia Minor . Armenia , the westward continuation of the great platform of Iran , is a very old land , old in the formation of its volcanic soil and old in the suffering of its people . It is another bridge country . Whosoever wanted to wander from Europe to India  | had to pass through the valleys of the high Kurdistan Mountains , and among those travellers have been some of the most notorious cut-throats of all time . Its history goes back to the days of the deluge . It was on the top of Mount Ararat , the highest mountain of this entire region , which rises 17,000 feet above sea-level and almost 10,000 feet above the plain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earth had begun to recede . This we know for certain because when Sir John de Mandeville , the Belgian physician , visited these regions in the beginning of the fourteenth century , he still found parts of the old craft lying around near the top . But when the Armenians themselves , who belong to the racial group of the Mediterranean and who therefore are our very near cousins , moved into these hills is still quite uncertain . At the recent rate of extinction , however , there soon wo n't be any more of them left . In one single year , 1895-1896 , the Turks , who were then the masters of the Armenian plateau , murdered several hundred thousand of them ; and the Turks are by no means their worst enemies and not half as savage with them as the Kurds . The Armenians have always been very pious Christians . But although they had adopted Christianity long before Rome , their church had retained several institutions , such as an hereditary priesthood , which made it a most obnoxious organization in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore sat quietly by while the Mohammedan Kurds slaughtered Armenians and stole their territory . Then came the Great War , and the Allies , trying to get into Turkey by the back door in order to relieve the English in Mesopotamia , stamped across all this territory . Such names as Lake Van and Lake Urmia , of which the world had never heard before , although they are among the biggest of all mountain lakes , suddenly appeared in the news of the day ; and Erzerum , an Asiatic frontier town of the old Byzantine Empire , attracted more attention than it had done since the days of the Crusades . When the fighting came to an end , it is small cause for surprise that the surviving Armenians wished a plague upon all of their  | tormentors and joined the Soviet Union . They were allowed to form the republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia , between the Caspian and the Black Sea at the foot of the Caucasian Mountains , which Russia had added to its territory during the first half of the nineteenth century . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Turks themselves , we wander a little further westward and enter the plateau of Asia Minor . Asia Minor , once merely a province of the empire of the old Sultan , is today all that remains of that Turkish dream of world dominion . On the north it is bounded by the Black Sea , on the west by the Sea of Marmora , the Bosporus and the Dardanelles , which cut it off from Europe , and in the south by the Mediterranean , from which the interior is separated by the Taurus Mountains . Across this territory , which is considerably lower than Iran , Persia or Armenia , runs a famous railroad , the socalled Bagdad railroad which has played such an important part in the history of the last thirty years . For both England and Germany wanted to have the concessions for the railroad that was to connect Constantinople with Bagdad on the Euphrates and Smyrna , the great harbor of the Asiatic west coast , with Damascus in Syria and with Medina , the holy city of the Arabs . No sooner had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a share in the future revenue . The French were thereupon given the northern part of Asia Minor where Trebizond , the export harbor for Armenia and Persia , was still waiting for suitable communications with the west . Foreign engineers then began to survey their roads through these ancient lands where the Greek philosophers of the Athenian colonies had first speculated upon the true nature of man and the universe , where solemn church councils had given the world the iron-bound faith by which the people of Europe had lived for over a thousand years , where Paul of Tarsus was born and where he had preached , where Turk and Christian had fought for the supremacy of the Mediterranean world , and where in some for-  | saken desert hamlet an Arab camel-driver had dreamed his first dreams of being Allah 's one and only prophet . This railroad as planned was to keep well away from the coastline , skirting those almost mythical seaports of ancient and medieval history ? Adana and Alexandretta and Antioch and Tripoli and Beirut and Tyre and Sidon and Jaffa , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoting itself chiefly to the mountains . When the war broke out , the railroad played exactly that role which the Germans had expected . The railroad , with its excellent German equipment , together with the presence of two big German battle-ships in Constantinople , were the two highly practical " considerations " which made the Turks join the Central Powers rather than the Allies . And how well that road had been planned from a strategical point of view was shown during the next four years . For the war was finally decided on the ocean and in the west . The eastern front never collapsed until long after the western front had begun to melt away . And the world learned to its surprise that the Turk made as good a soldier in the year 1918 as he had done in 1288 when the Seljuk Turks conquered the whole of Asia and cast their first longing glances across the Bosporus at the impregnable walls of imperial Constantinople . Up to then that mountainous plateau had been quite wellto-do . For Asia Minor , although part of the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fate of Armenia and the Persian plateau of Iran . This had been due to the fact that Asia Minor was not only part of a commercial highroad but also the terminal station for all the routes leading from India and China to Greece and Rome . For when the world was still young , the most active intellectual and commercial life of the Mediterranean was not to be found in Hellas itself . It flourished among the cities of western Asia which the Greek cities of the mainland had converted into Greek colonies . Where the ancient blood of Asia had mingled with the new race until it produced  | a mixture that for sheer intelligence and sharpness of wit has rarely found its equal . Even in the modern Levantines , of highly unsavory reputation in regard to business integrity and general honesty , we can detect traits of the old stock which for half a thousand years had been able to hold its own against its many enemies . The final disintegration under the rule of the Seljuks was inevitable . As a degenerative force , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But today this small peninsula is practically all that remains of the ancient glories of the Ottoman Empire . The Sultans themselves are gone . Their ancestors , after residing for almost a century in Adrianople , the only other Turkish city left in Europe outside of Constantinople , had moved to the latter city in the year 1453 , and from there had ruled a territory which included the whole of the Balkans , all of Hungary and the greater part of southern Russia . Four centuries of inexpressible mismanagement sufficed to  | ruin this empire and make it what it is today . Constantinople , the oldest and most important example of a commercial monopoly which for thousands of years held the key to the grain trade of southern Russia , that same Constantinople , so favored by Nature that its harbor came to be known as the Golden Horn , the Horn of Plenty , so filled with fish that no one ever need go hungry , was reduced to the rank of a third-rate provincial city . For the masters of the New Turkey , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded that the degenerate background of , Constantinople , a hodge-podge of Greeks and Armenians and Levantines and Slays and the accumulated riff-raff of all the Crusades , was not the place from which to try the well nigh impossible task of rejuvenating the Turkish people and turning them into a modern nation . They therefore chose themselves a new capital , the city of Angora in the heart of the Anatolian Mountains , more than 20o miles east of Constantinople . Angora was old , very old . Four hundred years before our era , a tribe of Gauls had lived here , the same sort of Gauls who afterwards took possession of the plains of France . It had passed through all the vicissitudes of all the cities situated on this main road of trade . The Crusaders had captured the city . The Tartars had done likewise . Even as late as 1832 an Egyptian army had destroyed that whole neighborhood . But it was there that Kemal Pasha founded the capital city of his new fatherland . He purged it of all the elements that could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turks who lived in these other countries . He built up his army and his credit with equal brilliancy . And he made the New Turkey a going concern , though Heaven knows , the mountains of Anatolia , after fifteen centuries of warfare and neglect , yield little enough that is considered of any value to a Wall Street banker who is looking around for possible prospects in the loan market . All the same , Asia Minor is generally recognized as being of the utmost importance for the future trade between Asia and Europe . Smyrna is regaining the position it already held when  | the Amazons , the female warriors of the ancient world , ruled this part of Asia and founded their curious state in which all male children were put to death and in which no man was allowed to set foot except once a year and then exclusively for the purpose of continuing the race . Ephesus , where Paul still found the natives worshipping the image of the Chaste Diana , the ideal goddess , by the way , for a race of Amazons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the region nearby may become one of the most lucrative fig gardens of the world . Further towards the north , past the ruins of Pergamum ( the great literary center of the ancient world which gave us our word parchment ) , the railroad skirts the plain of Troy to connect with Panderma on the Sea of Marmora . Panderma is only a day 's trip by boat removed from Scutari where the famous Orient Express ( London ? Calais ? Paris ? Vienna ? Belgrade ? Sofia ? Constantinople ) has connections with the trains that run to Angora and Medina and those which via Aleppo ? Damascus ? Nazareth ? Ludd ( change cars for Jerusalem and Jaffa )  - -  Gaza ? Ismailia ? Kantara connect with Suez and from there up the Nile as far as the Sudan . If it had not been for the Great War , that road could have been made profitable by transporting goods and passengers for India and China and Japan from western Europe by rail as far as Suez and then sending them the rest of the way by ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' fighting shall have been repaired , the aeroplane will probably be in general use for the passenger traffic . The eastern part of Asia Minor is inhabited by the Kurds , the ancient enemies of the Armenians . The Kurds , like the Scotch and most mountain peoples , are divided into clans and have too much individual pride to take kindly to a commercial or an industrial civilization . They are a terribly old race , already mentioned in the cuneiform inscriptions of the Babylonians and by Xenephon in his " Retreat of the Ten Thousand " ( what a dull book ! ) They belong to the same original stock as we do but they  | have been converted to Mohammedanism . As such they have never trusted their Christian neighbors , but this holds good of all the other Moslem states that were founded in consequence of the Great War , and not without cause as all of us who lived during those days , when " official misstatements " were part of the national strategy , have every reason to remember . When peace was finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrels were added to the old ones , all the more as several European powers now installed themselves as " mandatory rulers " over parts of the old Turkish Empire and proved to be but little less cruel in their dealings with native races than the Turks had been . The French , who had invested a great deal of money in Syria , took hold of Syria , and a French High Commission , amply supplied with money and troops , undertook to rule the three million odd Syrians who most certainly had not asked to be turned into a European " mandate " , which meant a colony but with a slightly less offensive name . Soon different elements that had been part of the old Syria were beginning to forget their dislike for each other in one common hatred for the French . The Kurds made peace with their hereditary enemies , the Roman Catholic Maronites of Lebanon ( the old home of the Phoenicians ) , and the Christians ceased to maltreat the Jews , and the Jews ceased to despise both Christians and Mohammedans , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to maintain themselves . But order apparently has been reestablished and Syria is rapidly becoming another Algeria . That does not mean that the people like their mandatory rulers any better than before but merely that the leaders have been hanged and the others lack the courage to go on fighting . As for the valley of the Tigris and the Euphrates , it was elevated to the rank of a monarchy and the ruins of Babylon and Nineveh are now part of the Kingdom of Irak . But the new potentates ha- dly enjoy the freedom of action of Hammurabi or Assur-Bani-Pal , for they have been forced to recognize England 's suzerainty . King Feisal has to await word from London  | whenever he wants to decide upon something more important than the re-digging of a few ancient Babylonian drainage canals . As for Palestine ( the land of the Philistines ) , which is also part of this region , it is so strange a country that I shall have to be very short about it for fear of filling the rest of this book with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some ninth-rate European principality like Schleswig-Holstein , but which somehow or other has played a greater role in human history than many a first-class empire . The original ancestors of the Jews , after leaving their miserable villages in eastern Mesopotamia , and after wandering through the northern part of the Arabian desert , and crossing the plains between Mount Sinai and the Mediterranean , and spending a few centuries in Egypt , finally retraced their steps . They stopped when they had reached the narrow strip of fertile land between the mountain-ridge of Judea and the Mediterranean and engaged in bitter warfare with the original natives , whom they finally deprived of a sufficient number of villages and cities to found an independent Jewish state of their own . Their lives can not have been very comfortable . In the west , the Philistines , non-Semitic settlers from the island of Crete , were in full possession of the coastal region , cutting the Jews completely off from the open sea . In the east , one of the strangest natural phenomena of which we have any record , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from north to south and going as deep as 1300 feet below sea-level , separated their country from the rest of Asia . This sink , which is very much today as it was when John the Baptist chose it as his place of residence , begins in the north between the Lebanon and the AntiLebanon and follows the valley of the Jordan , the Lake of Tiberias or Sea of Galilee , which is 526 feet below sea-level , the Dead Sea , which is 1292 feet below sea-level ( the Death Valley in California is only 276 feet , and the deepest spot on the American continent ) and from there ( for the River Jordan stops dead in the Dead Sea , which contains 25% salt on account of the constant evaporation ) through the ancient land of Edom ( where Caption  | the Moabites lived ) to the Gulf of Akaba , a branch of the Red Sea . The southern part of this sink is one of the hottest and most desolate regions of the world , full of asphalt and sulphur and phosphates and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just before the war the Germans founded a formidable Dead Sea Asphalt Company ) but which must have inspired the people of long ago with horror and fear , and which made them attribute the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah by an ordinary earthquake to an act of vengeance on the part of their Gods . The sudden change of climate and scenery when they had crossed the mountain ridge of Judea , which runs parallel with this great rift , must have made a tremendous impression upon the earliest invaders from the east and probably inspired that jubilant cry of a land " overflowing with milk and honey " . For the modern visitor to Palestine will find very little milk and the bees apparently have long since died for lack of a sufficient number of flowers . That , however , is not due to a change in the climate , as one hears so often said , for the climate today seems little different from the climate in the days when the disciples of Jesus wandered from Dan to Beersheba without bothering much about the problem of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was enough native wine for the simple needs of all travellers . But the Turks and the Crusaders between them played the role of climate . The Crusaders began by destroying whatever remained of the old irrigation works which had been built during the days of independence and dur. ing the centuries of Roman domination . The Turks had , as usual , done the rest . A soil which only needed water to bring forth rich harvests was systematically neglected until ninetenths of the farmer populace had either died or moved away . Jerusalem became a sort of Bedouin village where a dozen Christian sects and their Mohammedan neighbors were forever engaged in far from edifying quarrels . For to the Mohammedans , Jerusalem is also a very Holy City . The Arabs consider  | themselves the direct descendants of that unfortunate Ishmael who together with his mother Hagar was driven into the wilderness by Abraham at the request of the latter 's wedded wife , the redoubtable Sarah . But Ishmael and Hagar had not perished of thirst , as seems to have been Sarah 's little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become the founder of the whole of the Arabian nation . Today therefore he and his mother lie buried just outside the Kaaba , the center of the most holy of all places of worship in Mecca which all Mohammedans must visit at least once during their lifetime , no matter how difficult the voyage or how far the distance that separates them from that hallowed spot . As soon as the Arabs had conquered Jerusalem , they erected a mosque over the rock upon which , according to tradition , their distant cousin Solomon , another direct descendant of Abraham , had built his famous temple . That happened Heaven only knows how many centuries ago . But the fight for the ownership of that rock and the walls around it , part of which is the traditional " wailing wall " of the orthodox Jews , is responsible fox the continual quarrels between the two races that now make up the population of the Palestinian mandate . And what can one hope for the future ? When the English captured Jerusalem , they found the people to consist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews and Gentile Christians . The English , as the rulers of the largest Mohammedan empire of the modern world , could not afford to hurt the feelings of so many of their loyal subjects and dared not surrender half a million Palestine Moslems to the mercies of less than a hundred thousand Jews , who had many entirely justifiable axes to grind . The result was the usual post-Versailles compromise which satisfied nobody . Palestine today is a British mandate and British troops maintain order between the different nationalities . The governors are selected from among the best-known English Jews but the country is nevertheless a colony and does not enjoy that complete political independence of which Mr. Balfour had  | spoken so eloquently but also so vaguely when at the beginning of the Palestine campaign he referred to those regions as the future home of the Jewish race . Matters would become a great deal simpler if the Jews themselves knew what they wanted to do with the old mothercountry . The orthodox Jews of eastern Europe and especially those of Russia want to keep it as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hebrew antiquities . The younger generation , remembering the wise words of the Prophet that " the dead should bury the dead " , and feeling that too much weeping about the past joys and glories of bygone days is apt to interfere quite seriously with the glories and the joys of tomorrow , hope to make Palestine into a normal , modern state , something like Switzerland or Denmark , a going concern of men and women who have rid themselves of the memories of the Ghetto and who are more interested in good roads and good irrigation canals than in squabbling with their Arab neighbors about a few old stones which may or may not have been the well from which Rebecca drew the water but which are now merely a hindrance to progress . Since most of Palestine consists of rolling territory with a decided slope from east to west , it is indeed possible to reclaim the neglected and exhausted soil for purposes of agriculture . The sea winds which blow the greater part of each day spread their heavy dew across the entire landscape and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jericho , the only city of any importance ever built in the terrible Dead Sea region , may once more become a center for the trade in dates . And as the soil of Palestine contains neither coal nor oil , it will escape the attentions of the foreign promoter and will be allowed to work out its own problems as Yahweh and the Mohammedan majority will permit .  | ARABIA ? OR WHEN IS A PART OF ASIA NOT A PART OF ASIA ? ACCORDING to the maps in our ordinary atlases and according to the handbooks on geography , Arabia is a part of Asia . But the proverbial visitor from Mars , ignorant of the history of our planet , would probably come to a different conclusion and would decide that Ne j d , the famous Arabian desert , is really nothing but a continuation of the Sahara from which it is separated by an inconsequential and rather shallow bay of the Indian Ocean known as the Red Sea . This Red Sea is almost six times as long as it is wide and full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but where it connects with the Gulf of Aden , which is really part of the Indian Ocean , the depth varies between only two and sixteen fathoms . It is possible that the Red Sea , which is full of little volcanic islands , was originally an inland lake which did not get elevated to the rank of a sea until the Straits of Persia were formed , just as the North Sea did not really become a sea until after the formation of the British Channel . As for the Arabs themselves , they seem to have no desire to be either African or Asiatic , for they call their country " the island of the Arabians " , which is rather a large order for a piece of territory six times as large as the whole of Germany . The number of inhabitants is not at all in proportion to the size of their country . It does not exceed that of greater London . But the original ancestors of these 7,000,000 modern Arabs must have been possessed of extraordinary physical and mental qualities for they have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite an extraordinary fashion , and that without the slightest assistance from the side of Mother Nature . 317  | In the first place , they lived in a country with a climate that is not fit for human beings . Not only is this continuation of the Sahara Desert completely deprived of rivers , but it is also one of the hottest places on earth , except in the extreme south and east where the coast is so damp and moist as to be practically uninhabitable for Europeans . But in the center of the peninsula and in the south-west where the mountain-ranges reach a height of almost 6000 feet , the life of both Man and beast is made intolerable by those sudden changes in temperature which take place immediately after dark and which cause the thermometer to fall from 8o ? to 200 in less than half an hour 's time . If it were not for the underground water the interior would be entirely uninhabitable . As for the coastal regions they are not much better off except the territory immediately north of the British settlement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the whole blessed peninsula is not worth as much as the lower part of the island of Manhattan . But the island of Manhattan will have to do a great deal better than it has done so far if it ever wants to equal Arabia in its general influence upon the cultural development of the world . Curiously enough the Arab peninsula has never been a country as France or Sweden are countries . As a result of the irresponsible promises made to everybody and everything during the Great War when the Allies were badly in need of a few extra men , a baker 's dozen of so-called independent states now stretches all the way from the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Akaba and even further northward where Trans j ordania , ruled by an Emir who takes his orders from Jerusalem , separates Palestine from the Syrian desert . But most of them are mere names like El Hasa and Oman , along the Persian Gulf , Hadramut in the south and Yemen and Asir along the Red Sea , just south of El Hejaz which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hejaz not only has a railroad of its own ( the final part of the Bagdad road which now runs as far as Medina and which eventually will be continued to Mecca ) but it also is in control of the  | two holy cities of the Moslem world , Mecca , the place where Mohammed was born , the Bethlehem of the Moslems , and Medina where he lies buried . Neither of these two oasis cities amounted to much early during the seventh century when they became the center of such stirring events . Mohammed , who was responsible for their fame , was born in 567 or 569 , several months after the death of his father . Soon afterwards his mother died too and he was thereupon entrusted to the care of an impecunious grandfather . At an early age he became a camel-driver and travelled all over Arabia with the caravans who hired his services . He may even have crossed the Red Sea , and there is a possibility that he visited Abyssinia which was then trying to turn Arabia into an African colony ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert tribes hated each other too cordially to be able to put up a concerted fight ) . At an uncertain age he married a widow . Her property allowed him to give up his wandering life and open a little store of his own , dealing in grain and camel-feed . Like many other people suffering from epileptic fits , he had strange hallucinations when in a state of semi-consciousness , and , like many other people affected by that unpleasant ailment , he tried to console himself for his unfortunate affliction by telling his neighbors that he had gone into a trance in order to receive a revelation from God . Not being a man of great originality of thought , he did not find it easy to develop some definite and new system of religion of his own . He vaguely talked about restoring the ancient faith of Abraham and Ishmael . For a time he even seems to have played with the idea of adapting the Christian faith to the needs of his wild neighbors who would never have listened to any one talking to them of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their enemies . In the end , and under the pressure of his Meccan neighbors , who laughed rather heartily at the vegetable-vender turned prophet and who threatened his life when he began to take himself a bit too seriously , he fled to Medina and there he started upon his career as a preacher in all seriousness .  | I can not go into details about his doctrines . If you are interested , buy a Koran and try to read it , though you will find it hard sledding . Suffice it here to state that as a result of Mohammed 's labors , the different Semite tribes of the great Arabian desert suddenly became conscious of having to fulfil a mission . In less than a century they had conquered all of Asia Minor and Syria and Palestine , together with the whole of the northern coast of Africa and Spain . Until the end of the eighteenth century they were a constant menace to the safety of Europe . Well , a people who could do all that and in only a few years must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those who have ever had anything to do with them ( including Napoleon , who was a bad judge of women but who knew a good soldier when he saw one ) the Arabs are terrific fighters , and their medieval universities were concrete proof of their intellectual gifts and their interest in science . Why in the end they should have lost so much of their former prestige , I could not say . It would be very easy here to indulge in a few high sounding theories about the influence of the geographical background upon the character of men and then prove that desert tribes have always been great world conquerors , but there are just as many desert people who have never amounted to anything . Also there are just as many mountaineers who have done all sorts of wonderful things . And then again there are other mountaineers who have never risen far above the ranks of drunken and careless and lazy loafers . No , I am sorry , but I have never been able to draw a single general moral lesson from success or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what has happened once may happen again . The great reform movement of the middle of the eighteenth century which purged Mohammedanism of all forms of idolatry and which gave rise to the puritannical sect of the Wahhabites with their insistence upon frugal and simple living , may cause the Arabs to go on the warpath once more ; and if Europe continues to waste its strength on civil warfare they may become as dangerous to us as they were twelve centuries ago . Their terrible peninsula is a  | vast reservoir of " hard " people , of people who rarely smile , who rarely play , who take themselves with dignified seriousness and who can not be corrupted by the pleasant prospects of material wealth because their needs are so simple that they have never felt the lack of anything better . Such nations are ever a potential source of danger . Especially when they have a just reason to feel themselves aggrieved . And in the case of Arabia , as in that of all Asia , Africa , America and Australia , the White Man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | INDIA , WHERE NATURE AND MAN ARE ENGAGED IN MASS-PRODUCTION ALEXANDER THE GREAT discovered India . That happened three hundred years before the birth of Christ . But Alexander did not get very far beyond the Indus River , and although he crossed the Punjab , the home of the Sikhs , he never penetrated the heart of the country of the true Hindus who lived then as they do now in the wide valley of the Ganges , situated between the Himalayas in the north and the plateau of Deccan in the south . Eighteen centuries had to go by before the people of Europe got their first reliable information about this wonder-land of Marco Polo . That happened when the Portuguese Vasco da Gama reached Goa on the coast of Malabar . Once the sea route from Europe to the land of the spices and the elephants and the golden temples had been established , information poured in upon the geographers at such a vast rate that the map-makers of Amsterdam were kept working overtime . Since then every nook and corner of the teeming peninsula has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land in as few words as possible . In the north-west India is cut off from the rest of the world by the Khirdar Mountains and the Suliman range which run from the Arabian Sea as far as the Hindu Kush . In the north the barrier consists of the Himalayas which run in a semi-circle all the way from Hindu Kush to the Gulf of Bengal . Please remember that everything connected with India is on a scale which dwarfs the geographical proportions of Europe and makes them look almost ridiculous . In the first place , India itself is as large as all of Europe outside of Russia . The Hima-  | layas , if they were a European mountain-range , would run from Calais to the Black Sea . The Himalayas have forty peaks which are higher than the highest mountain of Europe . Their glaciers are on the average four times as long as the glaciers of the Alps . India is one of the hottest countries on earth and at the same time in several parts it has the records for the world 's annual rainfall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of over 350,000,000 people who speak 150 different languages and dialects . Nine-tenths of them still depend for their livelihood upon their own crops and when the annual rainfall is insufficient , they die of starvation at a rate of 2,000,000 per year . ( I am giving you the figures for the decade between 1890 and 1900 . ) But now that the English have stamped out the plague , have made an end to inter-racial warfare , have built vast irrigation works and have introduced the first rudiments of hygiene ( paid for of course by the Indians themselves ) they are increasing at such a rate that soon they will be just as badly off as they were in the days when pestilence and hunger and the death-rate of their babies kept the ghats of Benares working twenty-four hours each day . The big rivers of India run parallel with the mountainranges . In the west it is the Indus which runs first of all through the Punjab and then breaks through the mountains of the north , where it provided the prospective conquerors from northern Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As for the Ganges , the holy river of the Hindus , it follows a course which runs almost due west . Before it reaches the Gulf of Bengal , the Ganges is joined by the Brahmaputra which also takes its origin among the peaks of the Himalayas and which runs due east until it is forced to make a detour by the Khasi Hills , changes its course from east to west and shortly afterwards joins the Ganges . The valleys of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra are the most densely populated part of all India . Only in China are there a few spots where quite so many millions of people must fight each other for the barest necessities of life . On the western banks of  | the moist and marshy delta of these two enormous rivers lies the city of Calcutta , the chief manufacturing center of India . As for the products of the Ganges valley , more commonly known as Hindustan , or the land of the true Hindus , they are numerous and would probably be profitable if that whole part of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place , there is rice . The people of India and Japan and Java do not eat rice because they happen to be so fond of it , but they eat rice because rice yields more food per square mile ( and per square foot and per square inch ) than any other plant that has thus far been domesticated . The cultivation of rice is both difficult and messy . That is not a pleasant word , but it happens to be the only word that will adequately describe a procedure which forces hundreds of millions of men and women to spend the greater part of their time wading through mud and liquid manure . For the rice is originally sown in mud . When the little plants are about nine inches high they are dug out by hand and transplanted into flooded fields which must remain under water until it is time for the harvest , when the disgusting pap is allowed to run away by means of a highly complicated system of drainage ditches until it finally reaches the Ganges . At this point the Ganges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gathered together in Benares , the Rome of the Hindus and probably the oldest city in the world . By this time that putrid liquid has acquired such a degree of holiness that it can whiten sins which no other form of ablution could possibly hope to cleanse . Another product of the Ganges valley is jute , a vegetable fibre which was first sent to Europe a century and a half ago to be used as a substitute for cotton and flax . Jute is the inner bark of a plant which needs almost as much moisture as rice . The bark itself has to be soaked in water for weeks before the fibre can be extracted and sent to the Calcutta factories to be changed into ropes and jute bags and a coarse sort of clothing which the natives wear . Then there is the indigo plant from which we used to get our  | blue color until the recent discovery that it could be extracted much more economically from coal-tar . Finally there is opium , which was originally grown to deaden the pain of that rheumatism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the population spent so much of its time slushing knee-deep through mud , cultivating its meagre daily portion of rice . Outside of the valley on the slopes of the hills , tea plantations Caption have taken the place of the old forests . For the shrub which produces these tiny but valuable leaves needs a great deal of hot moisture and therefore grows best on mountain slopes where the water does not hurt the tender roots . Southward of the Ganges valley lies the triangular plateau of Deccan which has three different types of vegetation . The northern mountains and those of the west are the center for the trade to teakwood , a very durable sort of timber which does not warp or shrink and which does not corrode iron . It used to be in great demand for ship-building purposes until the introduction of the  | iron steamer , but is still used for a number of purposes . The interior of Deccan , which has very little rain and is another dreaded hunger spot , raises cotton and a very little wheat . As for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the east , they enjoy enough rain to support a large population providing them amply with rice and millet , a sort of grain which we import for chicken feed but which the natives of India eat instead of bread . The Deccan is the only part of India where coal and iron and gold are found , but these deposits have never yet been seriously exploited , for the rivers of Deccan have too many rapids to be of any use , and the construction of railroads would hardly pay in a part of the world where the natives , being totally without worldly goods , never stir beyond their own villages . The island of Ceylon , Past of Cape Comorin , is really a part of the Indian peninsula . The Palk Strait which separates it from Deccan is so filled with reefs that it must be dredged continually in order to be kept navigable . The reefs and sandbanks which form a sort of natural bridge between Ceylon and the mainland are called Adam 's Bridge , because Adam and Eve escaped that way from Paradise after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For according to the people of this part of the world , Ceylon was the original Paradise . It still is a Paradise compared to the rest of India . Not only on account of the climate and its fertility and the abundance ( but not superabundance ) of rain and its moderate temperature , but because it has escaped one of the worst evils of India . By remaining faithful to Buddhism , which the Indians rejected as being of such sublime spiritual value as to be entirely beyond the grasp of the average man , it has escaped the rigors of the caste system which until very recently was an inseparable part of the Hindu religion . Geography and religion are much more closely connected than we usually suppose . In India , where everything is done on a superlative scale , religion has since thousand of years dominated Man 's mind so completely and absolutely that it has become an integral part of everything the Hindu says and thinks  | and does and eats and drinks or carefully avoids to say or do or eat or drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfered with the normal development of life . The Chinese , with their veneration for the departed ancestors , bury grandpa and grandma on the southern slopes of their mountains . That leaves them only the cold and wind-swept northern slopes open for the cultivation of their daily bread . As a result of this otherwise highly laudable affection for the departed relatives , their own children starve to death or are sold into slavery . Indeed almost every race ( we ourselves included ) is handicapped by strange taboos or mysterious ancient laws of divine origin which quite frequently interfere with the progress of the whole nation . In order to understand how religion has affected the Hindu country , we must go back to almost prehistoric times , to at least thirty centuries before the first of the Greeks had reached the shores of the Aegean Sea . At that time the Indian peninsula was inhabited by a race of dark-skinned people , the Dravidians , who were probably the original inhabitants of the Deccan . The Aryan stock ( the same stock from which we ourselves have sprung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home in central Asia in search of more agreeable climes . One part moved westward and settled down in Europe , afterwards crossing the ocean and taking possession of northern America . The other trekked southwards through the mountain passes between the Hindu Kush and the Himalayas and took possession of the valleys of the Indus and the Ganges and the Brahmaputra and from there penetrated into the plateau of Deccan . By following the coastal region between the western Ghats and the Arabian Sea they finally reached southern India and Ceylon . The newcomers , being infinitely better armed than the natives , treated the latter as the stronger races have always treated the weaker ones . They spoke derisively of them as the Black Men , took their rice fields away from them , stole their women whenever their own supply ran out ( the trip across the Khyber  | Pass was too difficult to let them bring many women all the way from central Asia ) , killed them whenever they showed the least signs of rebellion , and forced the survivors to retire to the most undesirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starve as they wanted . But there were by far more Dravidians than Aryans and as a result there was a constant menace that the lower form of civilization would influence the higher one . The only way by which this could be prevented was by keeping the Black Man strictly in his place . Now the Aryans , like all the people of our race , have always  | had a tendency towards dividing society into a number of sharply differentiated social layers or castes . The idea of " caste " is known all over the world and it exists in America even in this year of enlightenment . It runs all the way from our discrimination against the Jews , based upon our unwritten code of social prejudice , to the formal laws of certain southern states which force Negroes to ride in Jim Crow cars . New York is a proverbially broad-minded city but I would not for the life of me know where to take a dark-skinned friend ( Negro or Hindu or even Javanese ) for dinner , and our trains pay homage to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day-coaches . I do n't know much about the caste system of the Negroes in Harlem , but I have seen enough of the mortification of German-Jewish fam flies when their daughters married men of Polish-Jewish descent to realize how wide-spread this feeling of " being something different from the common run of humanity " is in all of us . But with us the caste system has never developed into a hard and fast rule of social and economic behavior . The doors leading from one class to another are supposed to be kept carefully closed but we all know that those who can push hard enough or who have a little golden key or who are merely able to make enough noise banging the windows outside will sooner or later be admitted . The conquering Aryans of the Indies , on the other hand , had the doors leading from one class to another filled up with masonry ; and from that moment on each group of society was locked up in its own little compartment and it has been forced to stay there ever since . Now a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't just suddenly invent it to please themselves or to be nasty to their neighbors . In India it was the result of fear . The priests and the warriors and the farmers and the day-laborers , the original classes of the Aryan conquerors , were of course hopelessly outnumbered by the Dravidians whose country they had just taken away . They were bound to take some desperate measure by which to keep the black man in " his proper place " . But when they had done this , they went one step further , a step which no  | other race has ever quite dared to take . They gave their artificial " caste " system a religious twist and decreed that Brahmanism was to be the exclusive possession of the three upper classes , leaving their humbler brethren to shift for themselves outside the true spiritual pale . And thereupon , in order to keep themselves free from the defiling touch of all people of humbler birth , each individual caste surrounded itself by such a complicated barrier of ritual ceremonies and sacred usages that finally no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that maze of meaningless " verbotens " . If you want to know how such a system would work out in practical every-day life , try to imagine what would have happened to our own civilization if nobody during the last three thousand years had been allowed to proceed beyond the status of his father , grandfather or great-grandfather . What would have become of the personal initiative of the individual ? There are signs all around that India is on the eve of a great social and spiritual awakening , but until very recently such a change was deliberately held back by those who dominated all classes of Indian society , by the Brahmans , the hereditary members of the highest of all castes , that of the priests . The faith of which they were the undisputed leaders was known by the rather vague name of Brahmanism . Brahma , around whose personality this religion was built up , might be called the Zeus or Jupiter of the Hindu Olympus , the divine essence enhancing all creation , the beginning and end of all things . But Brahma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too unsubstantial for the average person , and therefore , while he continued to be worshipped in a general way as a venerable old gentleman who had done his duty when he created this world , the actual management of our planet was thought to have been surrendered to certain of Brahma 's deputies , a number of Gods and Devils of not quite such excellent social standing as Brahma himself , but relatives of the All-Highest nevertheless , and as such to be treated with the utmost consideration . That opened the door wide for the introduction of all sorts of  | strange , supernatural creatures , like Siva and Vishnu and a whole army of spirits and spooks and ghouls . They introduced the fear element into Brahmanism . People no longer tried to be good because being good was in itself something after which Man should strive but because it was the only way in which he could hope to escape the wrath of all the evil ogres . Buddha , the great reformer who was born six centuries before Christ and who knew what a noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the prevailing creed of his day the spiritual power it had been once upon a time . But although at first he was victorious , his ideas proved too unpractical , too noble , too elevated for the vast majority of his fellow-countrymen . As soon as the first enthusiasm had died down , the old Brahmans returned in full force . It is only during the last fifty years that the leaders of India have come to realize that a religion based ( as far as the man in the street is concerned ) almost completely upon ritual and empty ceremonial acts of devotion must eventually perish as a hollow tree must perish when it no longer is able to extract its nourishment from the living earth . And Hinduism is no longer that dead and hideous spiritual affliction which it may have been a few generations ago . The doors and windows of the old temples are being opened up wide . The younger men and women of India are conscious of the disaster that might have destroyed them if , divided against themselves , they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master . Strange things are happening along the banks of the Ganges . When strange things happen among 350,000,000 people , they are apt to form a new chapter in the history of the world . India , although it has several large towns , is still essentially a country of villages , for 71% of the people continue to live in the country . The rest are spread among the cities of which you should at least know the names . There is Calcutta , at the mouth of the Ganges and Brahmaputra . It began as an insignificant fishing village , but during the eighteenth century it became the  | center for Clive 's operations against the French and developed into the leading harbor of all India . It lost a great deal of its former importance when the Suez Canal was opened , because steamers found it more convenient to go directly to Bombay or to Karachi than to Calcutta when they happened to have a cargo for the Indus region or the Punjab . Bombay on its little island is also a creation of the East India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base and a harbor of export for the Deccan cotton trade . It was so eminently suited for this purpose that it attracted settlers from all over Asia and became the home of the last remaining group of followers of the Persian prophet , Zoroaster . These Parsees belong to the richest and most intelligent group of natives . Their worship of fire as something holy which must not be defiled , makes it impossible for them to burn their dead . Hence Bombay has attracted a sort of lugubrious attention as the city where the Parsee corpses are thrown to the vultures , a form of extinction which is so swift that it seems almost preferable to the slower method of being eaten by ordinary worms . On the eastern shores of the Deccan peninsula lies Madras , the main port of the coast of Coromandel . The French city of Pondicherry , a little towards the south , is a reminder of the days when the French were the most serious rivals of the English and when Dupleix and Clive fought for the possession of the whole of India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident of the Black Hole of Calcutta . But most of the important cities are naturally situated in the valley of the Ganges . In the west there is first of all Delhi , the old residence of the Mogul emperors who had chosen this city because it commanded the entrance gate from central Asia into the valley of the Ganges so thoroughly that he who was master of Delhi was also master of all India . Further down the river lies Allahabad , a holy city of the Mohammedans , as the name implies . In this same neighborhood lie Lucknow and Cawnpore , well known for their connection with the great mutiny of 1857.  | Further towards the south is Agra , the residence of four members of the Mogul dynasty , one of whom erected the Taj-Mahal , in memory of a woman whom he had greatly loved . Then further down the river we reach Benares , the Rome and Mecca of all good Hindus who not only come here to bathe in the holy waters of the river but also to die that they may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ashes strewn upon the river of their desire . But I had better stop right here . Whenever you touch upon a subject of India , whether you approach it as an historian , a chemist , a geographer , an engineer or a mere traveller , you find yourself right in the heart of profound moral and spiritual problems . And we people of the west should proceed carefully when we enter into this labyrinth in which we are both strangers and newcomers . Two thousand years before the learned councils of holy men in Nicea and Constantinople tried to formulate the creed which afterwards was to conquer the western world , the ancestors of these people about whom I am writing in so familiar a fashion had already settled obscure points of doctrine and faith which to this very day disturb the minds of my own neighbors and will probably continue to disturb them for another dozen centuries or so . It is easy , far too easy , to condemn things that are strange to us . Most of what I know about India is strange to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bewildered sense of uneasy irritation . But then I remember that I used to feel the same way towards my grandfather and grandmother . And now at last I am beginning to realize that they were right . Or at least , that , if they were not always entirely right , neither were they always as absolutely wrong as I used to think them to be . It was a hard lesson . But it tended to teach me a little humility . And Heaven knows , I needed it !  | BURMA , SIAM , ANAM AND MALACCA , WHICH OCCUPY THE OTHER GREAT SOUTHERN PENINSULA OF ASIA THE peninsula which contains these four ancient kingdoms , independent , semi-independent and subject , is four times as large as the Balkan peninsula . The first of the four when we start from the west , Burma , enjoyed complete independence until the year r 8 8 5 when the English , to the general approval of the natives and the world at large , sent the last of the local rulers into exile and annexed the country and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king himself but he was a true representative of a type that has no longer any reason to exist , except in the movies , the proverbial " Oriental potentate " who as a rule was nothing but an undetected lunatic . Needless to say that he was not even a local product but an import from the north . The peninsula as a whole has suffered a good deal from that kind of gentry . The situation of the local mountain-ranges was chiefly responsible . Whereas India was cut off from the north by high mountains which ran from east to west and therefore enjoyed a certain natural protection , the whole of this unfortunate peninsula is taken up by five independent mountain ridges which run from south to north and thereby offer almost ideal means of access to any one wishing to move from the harsh grass-land of central Asia to the rich coast-land of the Bay of Bengal and the Gulf of Siam and the South China Sea . And the sort of men bred by central Asia we have already met wherever our maps were dotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lest you should shed unnecessary tears over the fate of the last of the independent Burmese potentates , know ye that in  | order to celebrate his accession to the throne he had revived the good old Asiatic custom of killing all his relatives .

But in the eighties of the last century the story of these hundred odd brothers and cousins and nephews , slaughtered in cold blood , did not read quite so well , and an English governor took the place of the former monarch . Since then the country , whose population consists of only three percent Hindus but ninety percent Buddhists , has greatly prospered and the Irrawaddy River , which is navigable all the way from Rangoon to Mandalay , has become an artery of trade such as it had never been before . It has seen more rice boats and oil tankers and ships of all sorts than ever before during its long history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burma and separated from it by the Dawna Range and the Tanen-Tanng-gyi Mountains , it owes its continued independence to a combination of circumstances of which the mutual jealousy between England in the west and France in the east is most certainly not one of the least important . And furthermore , Siam has been singularly fortunate in its rulers . Old King Chulalongkorn , who held the throne for over forty years , was a descendant of a Chinaman who during the latter half of the eighteenth century had delivered Siam from the Burmese . By cleverly playing his western neighbors against those from the east , and by a few trivial concessions and above all things by not surrounding himself with English and French advisers but by choosing his experts from among the much less dangerous smaller nations , this enlightened Siamese reduced the number of analphabets in his domains from 90% to 20% , founded a university , developed railroads , made the Menam River navigable for over 400 miles , installed an excellent postal and telegraphic system and trained his army sufficiently well to make himself not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Instead of closing the country to foreign immigration , the industrious Chinese were liberally encouraged to settle down in the capital and they now form one-ninth of the total population and have greatly contributed towards making Siam one of the most important rice exporting nations . The interior is still densely covered with very valuable forests and teakwood is an important article of export . And good luck or good sense made the Siamese rulers retain at least a part of the Malacca peninsula which contains the richest tin deposits of the world . On the whole , however , the government of Siam has been opposed to the industrialization of the country . The inhabitants of all tropical lands will have to remain primarily interested in agriculture and other simple pursuits if they wish to survive . Siam seems to be one of the few Asiatic countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let Europe have its factories and slums , as long as Asia can keep its villages and fields . They may not be the sort of villages the westerling likes , but they suit the eastern temperament , and the factory does not . By the way , the agricultural riches of Siam are somewhat different from those of most other countries . Outside of a million hogs , raised by the Chinese , the country can boast of no less than 6,000,000 tame buffaloes and 6822 elephants , which are in domestic service and hire out as derricks and trucks . French Indo-China , the name usually given to all the French possessions in the peninsula , consists of five parts . The first one of these , going from south to north , is Cambodia , which occupies the valley of the big Mekong River as far as the delta . It raises cotton and grows pepper . Nominally it is still a kingdom , but under French supervision . In the interior , in the midst of the dense forests just north of the great lake called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ever been uncovered . They were built by a mysterious race , the Khmers , of whom we know remarkably little . During the ninth century of our era , these Khmers built themselves a capital in northern  | Cambodia called Angkor . It was no small affair , for the walls formed a square each side of which was not less than two miles long and thirty feet high . At first , under the influence of Hindu missionaries , the Khmers were Brahmans , but in the tenth century Buddhism was accepted as the official religion of the state . The spiritual explosion caused by this change from Brahmanism to Buddhism found an expression in the construction of a vast number of temples and palaces , all of which were built between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries when Angkor , the capital , was destroyed , leaving behind those most stupendous architectural ruins , compared to which the far famed efforts of our own Mayans were the work of simple-minded beginners . There is a theory that Angkor was originally built on the sea and long before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that case , the sea would have retreated more than Soo-miles . That would be a record . For in historical times the sea has never retreated much more than five miles in the case of Ravenna and seven miles in the case of Pisa . The why and how and wherefore of Angkor will probably always remain a secret . But here stood a city that was as important in its time as New York is today . And it is gone . It has become a subject for picture postal cards , sold at a penny a piece to the visitors of the Paris colonial exhibition . And yet , once upon a time , it was a center of civilization while Paris was still a collection of evil-smelling mud hovels . It is all very strange ! As for the delta of the Mekong , today it is part of the French colony of Cochin-China which the French occupied in 1867 when their imperial prestige needed a little boosting after the disastrous failure of the great Mexican expedition . It has one excellent harbor , Saigon , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can return to the home country to rest in peace and honor from their difficult labors in administering the four million Cochin-China entrusted to their care . To the east of Cochin-China lies Anam , which also continues to be a kingdom although since 1886 it has enjoyed the " protection " of the French . The interior produces timber but the coun-  | try is mountainous and has no roads and has therefore remained almost completely undeveloped . Tongking in the north is much more important because it not only has an excellent river , the Song-Koi , but also on account of the presence of coal and cement . It really is a part of China and as such raises and exports cotton , silk and sugar . Its capital is Hanoi which since 1902 is the chief seat of government for all the French possessions in Indo-China . These include , beside the four countries just mentioned , a narrow strip of land in the interior , called Laos , annexed in 1893 , and which I set down here merely for the sake of vital statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into two parts . The socalled " Federated Malay States " consist of four small semiindependent principalities under British protection , and the rest is a crown colony known administratively as the Straits Settlements . It was exceedingly important for England to get hold of the Malay peninsula , for the mountains , which sometimes rise to a height of 8000 feet , contain some very rich tin deposits and the climate allows a vast variety of tropical products to be grown here at practically no cost . Rubber , coffee , pepper , tapioca and gambier ( necessary in the dyers ' trade ) are exported in large quantities from Penang , on the straits of Malacca , and from Singapore , a city of over half a million inhabitants , situated on a small island which controls all the great sea routes between north and south and east and west . Singapore , the Lion City , is almost as old as Chicago , having been built by that famous Sir Stamford Raffles who foresaw the strategic importance of this point while administering the Dutch colonial possessions during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1819 Singapore was a jungle . Today it has more than 500,000 inhabitants , the strangest variety and hodge-podge of races and languages to be found almost anywhere in the Orient . It is as strongly fortified as Gibraltar and is the terminal station of a railroad line which connects it with Bangkok in Siam , but not as yet with Rangoon in Burma . It will play a great role when the inevitable clash between the east and  | the west finally takes place . In anticipation of that event , it maintains a set of bar-rooms , the splendor of which is famous all over the Orient , and loses almost as much money on the annual races as the city of Dublin .  | THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA , THE GREAT PENINSULA OF EASTERN ASIA // miles , a distance about equal to the diameter of the globe , and it is larger than the whole European continent . The Chinese people form fully one-fifth of the total population of our planet and they knew how to use gunpowder and how to write letters at a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunted the wild boar with a stone axe . To give an adequate description of such a country in a few pages is out of the question . All I can give you is a sketch , an outline . The details ( if you are interested ) you can afterwards fill in by yourself , for there is enough literature on China to upholster two or three libraries . China , like India , is a peninsula , but a semi-circular peninsula , not a triangular one . In another very important way it is different from India . No obliging mountain-range cuts it off from the rest of the world . On the contrary , the mountains of China resemble the fingers of a hand stretching out westward . In consequence thereof , the rich Chinese plains bordering upon the Yellow Sea have at all times been wide open to the hardy pioneers of central Asia . In order to overcome this handicap , the Chinese emperors of the third century before our era ( the period during which Rome and Carthage fought for the mastery of the Mediterranean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 feet wide and more than 30 feet high , which ran all the way from the Gulf of Liao-tung to Kiayu-Kwan , just west of Su-chow on the borders of the Gobi Desert .  | This granite barrier has done its duty well and honorably . In the seventeenth century it fell before the onslaughts of the Manchus . All the same , a fortification which has held its own for almost twenty centuries is no mere trifle . Those we build nowadays are useless after ten years . and have then got to be renewed at enormous cost . As for China proper , not counting in Mongolia and Manchuria ( which at the time of writing this chapter seems to be rapidly falling into the hands of the Japanese ) and Tibet and Turkestan , it is a vast circle neatly divided into three almost equal parts by the Yangtsze-Kiang in the south and the Hwang-Ho in the north . The northern part , in which Peking is situated , has very cold winters and moderately hot summers , as a result of which the people eat millet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winds from the north by the Tsing-ling-shan range , has a much warmer climate and a much denser population which eats rice and does not know the sight or taste of grain . The third part , south China , has warm winters and very hot and moist summers and raises everything that will grow in the tropics . Northern China is again divided into two parts , the mountain regions of the west and the plains of the east . These mountain regions of the west are the famous loess country . Loess is a very fine sort of loam , looking a yellowish gray , and it is very porous , as a result of which the rain of Heaven disappears as fast as it touches the earth , while rivers and brooks cut themselves deep ravines which makes travel from one part of the country to the other as difficult as it is in Spain . The plain of the east is situated on the Gulf of Chih-li which is so rapidly being filled up with the deposits carried down by the Hwang-Ho that it is almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the north there is another river , much smaller than the Hwang-Ho but quite as useless from the point of view of navigation . That is the Pei-Ho , which has the distinction of being the Chicago River of Peking , the great drainage canal which looks after the sewage disposal of the Chinese capital . As conditions in China change from hour to  | hour I will merely say that Peking has been the capital of the Celestial Empire for nine centuries , or ever since the days when William the Bastard conquered England , but that I have no idea whether at the time this book goes to press it will be the Chinese capital , a mere Chinese city or the temporary or definite residence of a Japanese general . It is however a very ancient town and it has seen a great many ups and downs . In 986 it was conquered by the Tartars who rebaptised it Nanking or the " southern capital " . In the twelfth century the Chinese recaptured it but did not care to retain it as their capital and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Half a century later it was once more taken by another Tartar tribe who now called it Chung-tu or the " central capital " . Another century later it was occupied by Genghis Khan , who however refused to come and live there in fatuous ease but remained faithful to his tent in the heart of the Mongolian Desert . One of his successors , the famous Kublai Khan , felt differently . He rebuilt the ruins of Peking and baptised them Yenking or " the great court " , although at that time they were better known by their Mongolian name of Cambaluc or the " city of the Khan " . Finally these Tartars were expelled too , and a king of Chinese origin , the first one of the famous Ming dynasty , mounted the throne . Yenking or the " great court " then became Peking or the " north court " . As Peking it has ever since remained the center of the Chinese government , but so far removed from the rest of the world that it was not until the year 186o that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official capacity and with all the pomp and circumstance befitting a man whose father had given the British Museum the Elgin marbles . The city in the hey-day of its power must have been tremendously strong . The walls were sixty feet thick and almost fifty feet high and defended by square towers and gateways which were fortresses in themselves . On the inside , the city was like a Chinese puzzle , containing a number of smaller cities , the one inside of the other , an imperial city , and a Manchu city and a  | Chinese city and , after the middle of the nineteenth century , a foreign city . Until the Boxer outbreak of 1900 the foreign diplomatic representatives lived in a small square of their own just between the Caption Manchu city and the Chinese city . After the siege , this diplomatic ghetto was strongly fortified and heavily garrisoned with troops of the different countries to prevent a recurrence of this most unfortunate incident . Peking , of course , contains a number of palaces and temples . But here I would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people of China and those of India which explains to a certain degree why these two countries have practically nothing in  | common except that they are both of them hopelessly overpopulated . The Hindus have always taken their Gods very seriously and when they built them a temple it must be the biggest , the most expensive and the showiest temple the money of the poor sweating peasants could buy . " Not a cent for public improvements , but millions for the Gods ! " was the slogan of the Brahmans . The Chinese are nominally Buddhists but every Chinaman from the humblest laundry-man in Mott Street to the most powerful of the old Mandarins had fallen under the influence of that shrewd old sage , Kung-fu-tsze or Confucius , who during the second half of the sixth century had preached his gospel of common , everyday horse-sense without wasting much time upon vague discussions about the Life Hereafter . And it was completely in keeping with the Confucian notions about the " sensible thing to do " that the Chinese rulers spent the greater part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dams and Chinese walls and river improvements , but just enough upon their temples and shrines not to make the Gods feel that they were in any way being slighted . As the ancient Chinese were a people of tremendous artistic ability , they could achieve much more satisfactory results and at a much smaller cost than the natives of the Ganges valley . It is true that nowhere in China does the traveller find anything at all comparable to the vast structures of India . A few gigantic statues of animals guarding the gardens of the Ming rulers , some sixty miles north of Peking , and here and there a large Buddha . That is all . The rest is of modest dimensions , albeit of excellent proportions . But curiously enough , the art of China appeals to the people of the west much more than does the art of India . Chinese paintings and sculptures and pottery and lacquer-work fit into a European or American home , whereas their Indian counterparts disturb the harmony and are slightly upsetting , even when seen in a museum . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very large coal deposits and the second largest iron deposits  | in the world . When the English and German and American mines get exhausted , we can still go to the province of Shan-si to keep warm . To the south-east of the province of Chih-li lies the province of Shan-tung with the peninsula of that name which separates the Gulf of Chih-li from the Yellow Sea . This part of China is very mountainous , except for the valley of the Hwang-Ho , which formerly ran due south into the Yellow Sea . But it changed its course suddenly in 1852 , and that little affair showed us that a flood in China really meant a flood . In order to find a parallel for the Hwang-Ho 's behavior we would have to imagine the Rhine suddenly making up its mind to flow into the Baltic or the Seine deciding to run into the North Sea instead of the Gulf of Biscay . As the Hwang-Ho has changed its mouth ten times since the end of the seventeenth century we are by no means certain that the present channel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the world are apt to keep a river within bounds are of no avail against such rivers as the Hwang-Ho and the Yang-tsze , for the dikes through which the river broke in the year 1852 were fifty feet high and they tore apart like tissue paper . And then there is something else that makes these rivers such a nuisance . You must have heard the Chinese referred to as the yellow race and you must have seen articles in the newspapers about the Yellow Peril , etc. , etc . As a rule we associate the idea of yellow and Chinese with the color of a Chinaman 's face . But when the emperors of China called themselves Hwang-ti , which meant Lord of the Yellow Earth , they were not thinking of their subjects but of the land inhabited by these subjects . The yellow loess mud carried down by the Hwang-Ho turns everything in northern China yellow ? the water of the river , the water of the sea , the roads , the houses , the fields , the clothes of the men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given its name to a race which for the rest is really not much more yellow than the average city dweller of the west . In order to permit his subjects to proceed from northern  | China to central and southern China without running the risk of a long sea voyage , one of the Chinese emperors who lived during the thirteenth century ordered a canal to be built that should connect the Hwang-Ho with the Yangtsze-Kiang . It was more than a thousand miles long and fulfilled its purpose faithfully until the year 1852 when the Hwang-Ho moved from the Yellow Sea to the Gulf of Chih-li and the canal was destroyed together with the old river bed . But this Grand Canal , the longest in the world , shows that the ancient rulers of the land were men of enlightened views . But to return to the peninsula of Shan-tung . Its hard granite coast has been responsible for the formation of several very important harbors . One of those , Wei-hai-wei , just east of Chi-fu , was until recently in English hands . The British had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur on the other side of the Gulf of Chih-li to use it as a naval base and a station of their Trans-Siberian railroad . The " renting contract " stipulated that England should withdraw as soon as the Russians had disappeared from the Liao-tung peninsula . But when Japan took Port Arthur in 1905 , the English remained . The Germans , not to be outdone , must then occupy the bay of Kiao-Chow , further towards the south , and the city of Tsing-tao , both of them also parts of the Shan-tung peninsula . This meant that the Great War also had its reverberations in the Far East . Germans and Britons fought for the possession of something which belonged to neither of them and , as usually happens in such cases , a third party , the Japanese , got away with the stolen goods . In order to regain a little of the goodwill of the Chinese , Weihai-wei and Kiao-Chow have since been returned to China . But if Japan succeeds in taking Manchuria , the old game will probably begin all over again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the east central China consists of a wide and fertile plain which is really the continuation of the plain of northern China , but the interior is mountainous . Through these mountains the Yangtsze-Kiang wends its tortuous way until at last it reaches  | the East China Sea . It takes its origin in the province of Szechuen , a region almost as large as France , but supporting a much larger population as the red soil is exceedingly fertile . Several mountain-ranges running from south to north cut it almost completely off from the rest of the world . As a result it has suffered but little from the visitation of the White Man and is distinctly more Chinese than the rest of China . Continuing its course towards the sea , the Yangtsze next traverses the province of Hu-peh where the famous city of Hankow is situated . This was the center of the revolution of 1911 which upset the last emperor of the Manchu dynasty and turned the oldest monarchy in the world into a republic . Up to Hankow the Yangtsze is navigable for sea-going vessels with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hankow , the river is the main artery of commerce for central China until it reaches Shanghai , the center of China 's foreign trade and one of the first Chinese harbors which was opened to foreign commerce at the conclusion of the so-called " opium war " between England and China in the year 1840-1842 . To the south of the Yangtsze delta lies Hang-chow , which Marco Polo knew as Kinsai , and in the east Su-chow , the name of which suggests tea . The suggestion is correct . The lower part of the Yangtsze valley is very fertile and it was for this reason that Nanking , which is situated where the Yangtsze begins its delta , was for a long time not only the most important city of central China but also the residence of its emperor . Partly on account of its historical past and partly on account of its strategic position , half-way between Canton and Peking , and partly because it is not directly menaced by the guns of foreign warships , the city of Nanking was chosen as the center of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1932 , seven minutes past midnight ) seems to be the " official government " of China . As for southern China , it is a mountainous country and , although it raises tea and silk and cotton , it has always been a comparatively poor region . Once upon a time it was covered with  |  forests , but the forests were cut down and the soil was washed away by the rain , and the bare rocks remained . Hence wholesale emigration to all parts of the world which have not yet passed laws restricting the number of Chinese visitors . The most important city in southern China is Canton , which is the main harbor of import into China just as Shanghai is the most important center for export to Europe . At the mouth of the Canton River ( the city itself is a few miles inland ) lie two foreign possessions . On the right bank , Macao , all that remains of the Portuguese possessions in China and now merely a sort of oriental Monte Carlo , and Hong-Kong , a city which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since . Of the two islands off the coast of southern China , Hai-nan is still Chinese , but Formosa , an old Dutch colony , has belonged to Japan since the Chinese-Japanese War of 1894-1895 . Ninety percent of the Chinese are , always have been and probably always will be farmers who live on their own products and starve when there is a bad season . But forty-eight harbors have been opened up for the foreign trade and their main exports are silk and tea and cotton . Curiously enough , there is no export of opium . The Chinese emperors have always tried to protect their people against this unfortunate habit-forming drug and gradually the old poppy fields have been changed into cotton fields . As for railroads , the Chinese fought the idea longer than any other nation because , with their respect for the memory of their parents and ancestors , they feared to upset the peaceful slumbers of these departed worthies when the engines should come thundering down the roads of iron . The few miles built in 1875 between Shanghai and Wu Sung , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were immediately discontinued . And even today the Chinese railroads describe wide circles around all cemeteries . Still , there are now over To , 000 miles of railroad in actual use and the bridge across the Hwang-Ho near Tsi-nan is the biggest railroad bridge in the world . As for China 's foreign trade , almost 6o% is still in the hands  | of England and her colonies and that probably explains why England has been obliged to discontinue her old ruthless policy towards the inhabitants of the Celestial Empire . A boycott of English goods by these industrious Celestials would mean a loss Caption of millions of dollars a day . It is good policy to keep on friendly t , . rms with a customer who happens to represent the interests of le-fifth of the entire human race . When the earliest ancestors of the Chinese dimly emerged from the nebulous realm of the past , they were already living on the Yellow Earth along the banks of the Hwang-Ho , north-west from the heart of the present China . The fertile loess fields must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Furthermore it also settled the housing problem , for it allowed a man to dig himself a comfortable little home in the side of a convenient hill and not bother about draughty walls or a roof that leaked . According to reliable accounts of travellers who are familiar with that part of the world , there are spots which are known to be densely populated but where one fails to see a single vestige of human habitation until the first rays of light tell of the coming of another day . Then , like so many rabbits who swarm out of their holes to enjoy the sun , those men , women and children begin their endless tasks of gathering food until eventide , when they disappear once more into the bowels of the earth . Having occupied the mountains , the Chinese then spread eastward . The turbulent Hwang-Ho carried millions of tons of mountain loess into the plains and thereby fertilized them until they were fit to support further millions of human beings . The Chinese followed in the wake of the river and twenty centuries before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rome ) the Chinese had wandered as far as the Yangtsze and the center of their empire had been moved from the Hwang-Ho region to the great plain of central China . During the fifth and fourth centuries before the birth of Christ , three great moral teachers arose among them , Kung-futsze or Confucius , Mang-tsze or Mencius , and Lao-tsze , whose name has not been latinized . What the religious conceptions of the Chinaman were at the time these three prophets made their appearance , we do not know . Nature apparently was worshipped as the forces of Nature will always be worshipped by those who depend upon them for their living , and not Confucius nor Mencius nor Lao-tsze were religious founders in the sense of the word as applied to Christ or Buddha or Mahommed . They merely taught a moral code based upon the acceptance of man as a pretty inferior and not very brilliant product of creation but capable of great development provided he fell into good ? hands and was willing to listen to the precepts of his elders and betters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can  | of course be accused of preaching a very worldly and decidedly materialistic doctrine . None of them said much about humility and meekness or preached that we must return good for evil . They knew that the average man was not capable of such noble and elevated deeds , and furthermore they seem to have doubted whether such a rule of conduct was really for the ultimate good of the community at large . Wherefore they suggested such things as that evil should be answered with justice and that one should pay one 's bills and keep contracts and honor the memory of honorable ancestors . These three Chinese philosophers spread their morality pretty thin but every one got at least a smear of it . I do n't say that this was a better system than ours or a worse one . But it was a system not devoid of certain very definite advantages . It gave a people consisting of 400,000,000 different individuals , speaking a couple of dozen different dialects ( a Chinaman from the north finds it just as hard to understand a brother Chinaman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an Italian ) and living under entirely different circumstances , at least one thing in common ? a decidedly Chinese attitude towards the ups and downs of life , a practical philosophy of existence which will pull the humblest of coolies through hardships that would either kill the average European or American or would drive him to commit suicide . And these ideas were sufficiently simple to be understood by almost every one . As a proof whereof I refer you to the miracles of assimilation performed by the Chinese during the 4000 years of their history . They are preposterous and at the same time fabulous . During the tenth century China became part of the greatest empire that ever existed , that Mongolian commonwealth that reached from the Baltic to the Pacific . But all those Mongolian rulers were like Kublai Khan . They ended by becoming Chinamen . After the Mongolians came the Mings ( 1368-1644 ) , the last purely Chinese dynasty to rule the country . They were succeeded by a Tartar prince who came from Manchuria and who was the founder of the Manchu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ token of submission to their Manchu masters , were forced to grow their hair long and wear a pig-tail and shave the rest of their heads , the Manchus soon became even more Chinese than the Chinamen themselves . After the last Manchu invasion the Chinese were ? eft completely to themselves and by merely guarding their harbors against all foreign visitors from the west , the civilization of China had a chance to settle down for a little rest . But the moment it did this , it petrified more completely than any other country of which we have ever heard . Its political system became even more rigid than that of the old Russia of pre-revolutionary days . Literature froze , even their incomparable art became as stereotyped as that of the Byzantine mosaic makers of ancient Constantinople . Science no longer made any progress . If by chance some one still happened to invent something new it was at once discarded as foolish and undesirable , just as the medical department of our own army tried to discourage the use of chloroform because it was both new and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the world and never had a chance of finding out what other nations were doing , it was easy for the Chinese to convince themselves that their own methods were best , that their own army was invincible , that their own art was the most sublime art ever wrought by the hands of human beings and that their own customs and habits were so superior to those of all other nations that it was ridiculous to compare the two . Many other countries have in a mild way tried such a policy of exclusion but it has always ended in disaster . Since the early half of the sixteenth century the Chinese had allowed a few " foreign devils " , hailing from Portugal and England and Holland , to settle in two or three of their Pacific ports for the sake of the profits that were to be derived from the trade with Europe . But the social status of those unfortunate foreigners had been most unsatisfactory . They were treated like a respectable colored doctor who by chance is obliged to travel on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first settlers .  | When England in 1816 sent Lord Amherst ( nephew of Jeffrey and the man who interviewed Napoleon on St. Helena in 1817 ) to ask the Son of Heaven to mitigate the hardships from which the English merchants suffered in Canton , he was told that an interview with the Celestial Majesty depended upon his willingness to kow-tow before the imperial throne . The kowtow , which literally meant " knocking the head three times upon the ground before the sacred throne " was something which a Dutch sea-captain could afford to do , for once he had kow-towed himself out of the reception room he knew that he could take home enough tea or spices to be comfortable for the rest of his life . But the representative of His British Majesty was somewhat differently placed . Lord Amherst curtly refused and as a result was not even allowed to enter the gates of Peking . Meanwhile Europe , growing rich in consequence of the invention of James Watt and the application of steam for the purpose of exploiting our little planet , was clamoring for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i on the list . The direct excuse for the outbreak of hostilities was not exactly flattering to the pride of the white race , least of all for that part of it which ever since 1807 , when Dr. Morrison had reached Canton as the first European missionary , had been telling the Chinese what a fine thing Christianity really was and why they should give it a chance . Even those pedantic and narrow-minded Mandarins ( merely a Chinese title for administrator ) who then ruled China were still sufficiently steeped in the teachings of Confucius to refuse to let their people be exposed to the unlimited importation of opium . But the British India Company was making millions of pounds out of the sale of poppy-seed to the people of the Yangtsze and the Hwang-Ho . The British India Company insisted upon importing opium into China and the Chinese authorities refused to let the stuff be landed . Opium and hurt feelings then led to the war of 1840 in which the Chinese , to their dumbfounded surprise , discovered that they were absolutely no match for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had dropped so far behind  | the rest of humanity that it was doubtful whether they would ever be able to catch up . This fear bids fair to come true . Ever since the disastrous days of the Opium War , China has been completely at the mercy of the westerner . The Chinese people , who are apt to go on plowing and harvesting , no matter who is fighting in the adjacent fields , have at times given evidence of the fact that they are beginning to realize that something is wrong with their country . The first outbreak of discontent occurred about eighty years ago . The Chinese then blamed the disasters of their hapless land upon the " foreign " Manchu dynasty and rose up in rebellion to set themselves free . While the Manchus were engaged in a war with England and France , southern China started the so-called Tai-ping rebellion . They ceased to shave their heads and they cut off their pig-tails , but the imperial armies , led at first by an nrnerican engineer named Ward and afterwards by an Englishman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a profound mystic , were much too powerful for the poor misguided revolutionists . The " Emperor " whom they had elected to replace the Manchus burned himself alive with all his wives and concubines in his residence in the city of Nanking . Hundreds of thousands of people were executed and Gordon returned to England to devote himself to acts of charity and piety , performed in his leisure hours when he was not drilling troops , and to prepare for his tragic end of which you shall hear in the chapter on Africa . Then in 1875 there was a slight difference of opinion between the Manchus and Germany , and Germany sent a squadron to purify the Chinese coast of pirates . During 1884 and 1885 there was a war with France which cost the Chinese Anam and Tongking , and in 1894 there was a war with Japan , now thoroughly Europeanized , which ended with the cession of the island of Formosa . Then began the great European rush for armaments and strategic points . The Russians took Port Arthur , the English took Wei-hai-wei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kiang Hung on the left bank of the Mekong River . America , which has thus far always mixed sentiment ( and often , alas , sentimentality ) with its foreign policies , talked vaguely about " maintaining the open door " and the European nations were turning the territory they had stolen into impregnable fortresses and closed the door whenever their uncle from across the ocean was not looking . The Chinese people , patient and plodding though they are by nature , began to grasp the fact that they were being cheated right and left . Once more holding the foreign Manchu dynasty responsible for all their humiliations and misery , they started the unfortunate Boxer rebellion of the year 1901 . They began their operations by murdering the German ambassador ( their plausible excuse was that he had first struck a Chinaman ) and then besieged the foreign legations in Peking .

The Forbidden City , the heart of the imperial residence , was broken into . Nothing was spared , no matter how holy it might be to the Chinese , and the German commander-in-chief , who arrived with an extra 20,000 men ( when the shooting was already over but the plundering still in full swing ) had been instructed by his imperial master to " follow in the footsteps of the Huns " ? an unfortunate expression which came home to roost a little over a dozen years later and which was one of the worst boomerangs old Wilhelm ever sent forth during the days when he indulged in that sport in preference to his present craze for chopping wood . Condemned to pay enormous indemnities and humiliated in every possible way by their ever more aggressive European neighbors , the Chinese people once more rose in rebellion in the year 1911 and this time they were successful , for the Manchu dynasty was abolished and China was turned into a republic .  | But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesson that the nations of the west are not primarily interested in chapters from the writings of Confucius , but care much more for coal concessions and iron concessions and oil concessions and that therefore those possessed of these valuable raw materials must either know how to defend their property or sink it to the bottom of the ocean if they want it to be absolutely safe . In short , China began to recognize the necessity of following the example of Japan by taking a short course in " westernization " . Foreign teachers were engaged from all over the world , but principally from Japan , which was nearby and handy . In the meantime , Russia had started upon its ambitious plan to convert one-sixth of the world into an industrial state , administered according to the Gospel of Saint Marx ; and Russia , being a very close neighbor of China could whisper strange words into the ears of the long-suffering coolies who had been born to sweat and work , no matter who ruled them or whether they were being exploited by the English or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicting ideas , plans and emotions is the chaos which has descended upon China since the end of the Great War , during which it was forced to take the side of the Allies in a quarrel in which as usual it had nothing to gain and a great deal to lose .

What a bill !  | KOREA , MONGOLIA AND MANCHURIA , IF THE LATTER STILL EXISTS WHEN THIS BOOK IS PUBLISHED LET US begin with a short and elementary lesson in practical economics . The Japanese , cooped up on their little island , and as prolific as Italians , need more land . All the pretty words in the world and all the treaties in the world and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen in the world wo n't change this fact . For it is really a law of Nature which states that when I am strong but hungry and find myself on a raft somewhere in mid-ocean in the company Of somebody else who is weak but who has a pocket full of ham sandwiches , I will in the end get my share of those ham sandwiches , or I shall have died in the attempt . Being a decent sort of a person , carefully brought up by God-fearing parents , I may resist the temptation for one day or for two days or even three days . But the hour will come when I will say , " Give me some of those sandwiches or I will throw you overboard ? and be quick about it ! " My early training may assert itself sufficiently to let me treat the owner of the sandwiches more or less generously and allow him to keep part of the supplies , but I am going to still that terrible gnawing feeling in my entrails if I have to commit murder to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raft by a millionfold or ten million-fold and you will begin to appreciate the problem that faces the Japanese people . They live in a country that is smaller than California ( 155 , - 652 square miles for California and 148,756 square miles for Japan ) and of these only 16,0oo,000 acres can be used for agriculture , which is less than 2% of all the arable land of Amer-  | ica . If you want the comparison to come a little nearer home , it is a trifle less than the improved farmlands of New York State alone . Even with the help of one of the best staffs of scientific agricultural experts to be found anywhere in the world , you will see at a glance what sort of problem it is that faces these poor island folk . Living so near the sea-shore they would of course fish ; but although they have now reached the point where they are raising certain sorts of fish in the muddy water of their rice fields , the difficulty remains unsolved and unsolvable in view of the fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was inevitable therefore that Japan should look for more territory ; and it was only natural that first of all she should think of the badly administered and sadly neglected lands that lay just across the China Sea . America would have suited her better , but it was too far away and besides is much too strong . Australia was also too far away , and nine-tenths of that continent are a desert and of no possible use to anybody . But Manchuria was within easy reach , and the road to Manchuria was indicated by the land bridge of the Korean peninsula from which the mainland of Japan was separated by the narrow Strait of Korea . This strait is only 1 o2 miles wide and is conveniently divided into halves by the Tsushima islands , those islands near which the Japanese fleet destroyed the Russian squadron in the year 1905 , and killed Russia as a possible rival in eastern Asia . As for the Korean peninsula , which is situated in the same latitude as southern Italy and Sicily , although it has a much colder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Koreans who called their country Ch'ao Hsien or " the chosen land of the morning quiet " , were descendants of Chinese immigrants who had occupied the country in the twelfth century before the birth of Christ . They had easily conquered the natives , a very primitive race who had lived in caves and subterranean holes in the mountains of the interior . These immigrants from the west had then established a kingdom of their own , which however was never able to gain complete independence from the mother  | country of China and which was forever being harassed by Japanese pirates . In the year 1592 Japan made her first attempt to get hold of Korea . Japan never would have dared to start upon so ambitious a campaign unless she had been fully prepared . The preparations consisted of several hundred blunderbusses which Portugal had sold them . Relying upon her superior armament , Japan sent 300,000 men around the Strait of Korea , engaged in a war which lasted five years , and was then defeated only by the superior numbers of the Chinese who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was this invasion , during which Seoul , the capital of Korea , was destroyed , and during which all sorts of horrible atrocities were committed , which accounts for the hereditary hatred of the Korean people for everything Japanese . But what will you ? The Koreans were weak and the Japanese were strong ; and when , during the last quarter of the nineteenth century , the Koreans were forced to grant all sorts of economic and political concessions to the Russians , the Japanese had an excellent excuse for a fresh campaign . The immediate causes for a war are rarely interesting . It is the real underlying motives that count . In this case , as in the case of the expedition of 1592 , they were to be found directly and absolutely in the necessity of the Japanese government to provide its rapidly increasing population with food . As soon as Japan had defeated Russia and had driven the Muscovite troops back from the Yalu River , the river that separates Korea from Manchuria , Korea became a Japanese protectorate . In 1910 it became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which the Japanese had taken from the Chinese in 1895 , or the southern half of the island of Sakhalin , which they had taken from the Russians in the year 1905 in lieu of a war indemnity . Today already half a million Japanese have moved n among the twenty million Koreans . The rest will follow in due course of time . As for Manchuria , it had long been a bone of contention be-  | tween the two nations that fought for supremacy in the northern half of the Pacific . After the Peace of Portsmouth , which made an end to the Russo-Japanese war , the fate of the country was sealed . Who was there left to protect Manchuria against Japan ? Nominally the country still belonged to China , but China , after the Boxer Rebellion , was much too weak to protect anybody , even herself . Why did n't the Manchus put up a fight ? A people energetic enough to conquer all of China and to establish themselves as the rulers of one-fifth of the total population of the earth must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long since moved southward into China . The six percent that remained of the original population were mainly little farmers without an interest in the land . The other sixteen million people , spread over a territory four times as large as England and Scotland , lived as they had always lived , which meant that they had just enough to eat not to die , but as for fighting , why should they ? And when Manchuria is gone , it will be the turn of Mongolia . For Mongolia is a very big country , almost 1,400,000 square miles , or eleven times as large as the British Isles and it has a population of less than 2,000,000 people . The southern regions are uninhabitable because they form part of the Gobi Desert but the rest consists of grass-lands , eminently suited for purposes of cattle-breeding . Otherwise the Mongolians , who depended for their success upon their cavalry , would never have been able to raise those tough ponies which carried them triumphantly from the Pacific to the Atlantic . Many people seem to experience a profound indignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of " Japanese ambition " . I would rather call them " Japanese necessities " . In matters of international policy , a certain healthy egoism is rather a desirable quality . Japan has got to find an outlet for the extra people at home . It is finding such an outlet in northern Asia , in a part of the world that is very lightly populated , and that has been accustomed to such outrageous forms of government that the inhabitants can not possibly be worse off now than . they were ever before .  | If this northern Asiatic safety-valve did not exist , the Philippines , the Dutch East Indies , Australia , New Zealand and the western coast of America would be forever exposed to a Japanese invasion and we would be obliged to station a battle-ship in front of every Polynesian island lest it be towed away over night by a Japanese cruiser . On the whole , the present arrangement seems much more practical . Those who feel inclined to shed tears at these callous and selfish utterances , are politely requested to weep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JAPANESE EMPIRE JAPAN , before it started upon its career of world-conquest at the expense of its neighbors , consisted of more than 500 islands which follow a semi-circle reaching all the way from the peninsula of Kamchatka in the north to the coast of the Chinese province of Kwang-tung in the south , a distance equivalent to that between the North Cape of Europe and the center of the Sahara Desert in Africa . Of these islands , which vary in size between the whole of England and Scotland and Manhattan , 518 are inhabited by some 6o,000,000 people . The total number of Japanese , according to the latest statistics , is over 90,000,000 but that takes in 20,000,000 Koreans and several Polynesian islands which have been Japanese territory since the recent Great War . For all practical purposes , however , it is sufficient to remember the names of Honshiu , the main island in the center , Hokkaido , the next biggest island in the north , and Shikoku and Kiushiu , the two big islands immediately south of Honshiu . The capital is Tokio , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of Honshiu . The harbor of Tokio is Yokohama . The second largest city is Osaka , in the southern part of the same island , the center of the important Japanese textile industry . North of Osaka lies Kioto ( Tokio is merely Kioto turned around ) , the ancient capital of the Empire . Other cities , whose names you will occasionally encounter in our newspapers , are Kobe , the port of Osaka , and Nagasaki on the southern island of Kiushiu , the most convenient port for all vessels coming from Europe .  | As for the word Yedo , which you will often find in your history books , it is merely the ancient name of the city of Tokio during the period when it was the residence of the Shoguns . When the Shoguns lost their power in the year 1866 , the emperor moved from Kioto to Yedo , the city was rebaptised Tokio , and it began that extraordinary development which has made it one of the biggest cities of the modern world . But all these towns live in constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are merely the outer edges of the great Asiatic mountains , ( the Japanese Sea , the shallow Yellow Sea and the East China Sea are of very recent date , like the North Sea which turned England into an island ) , are part of the volcanic ridge that stretches from the island of Sakhalin to Java in the Dutch East Indies , and they are in almost constant motion . The seismographic observation statistics of Japan reported 27,485 earthquakes between 1885 and 1903 . That gives an average of 1447 per year or four per day . Of course , most of these are of no particular importance . A slight shiver in a teacup , a rattling of a chair against the wall and that would be all . But one gets some idea of the danger to which this island region is exposed when you realize that Kioto , the ancient capital , was shaken 1318 times during the ten centuries of its existence . Of these 1318 shakings , 194 were classified as " strong " and 34 as absolutely " destructive " . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tokio almost completely and which killed more than 150,000 people and lifted certain small islands a couple of feet in the air , while sinking others below sea-level , was of such recent date as still to be remembered by all of us . People often associate earthquakes with volcanic disturbances . Some of them are undoubtedly the result of volcanic eruptions . But most earthquakes are caused by a sudden sliding among those layers of rocks which lie beneath the soil on which we live . When such layers move only two or three inches , the result is a commotion which may merely upset a few trees and shrubs but which , if it takes place in exactly the right spot ( the wrong spot would be better ) may cause a catastrophe like that  | of Lisbon in 1755 , when 60,000 people were killed , or Canton in China in 1920 when the number may have been as high as 200000 . According to the conservative estimate of one of the greatest seismological experts , the earthquakes of the last forty centuries , the so-called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 13,000,000 people , which , when all is said and done , is quite a considerable number . Earthquakes , of course , may happen almost anywhere . Only a year ago the bottom of the North Sea was severely shaken by an earthquake , and the mud flats of the islands at the mouth of the Scheldt and the Rhine trembled sufficiently to give the dam-diggers a moment of great uneasiness . Yet the North Sea region is as flat as a pancake . The Japanese islands , on the other hand , are situated on the top of a high ridge which on the eastern side descends into one of the deepest holes in the bottom- of the ocean our scientists have so far been able to locate . The famous Tuscarora Deep descends to over 28,000 feet , which is only 60oo feet less than the record depth between the Philippines and the Marianas or Ladrones . It surely is no mere accident that more than half of all the disastrous earthquakes of Japan have taken place along the eastern shores where the coast makes a sheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like most people who live in earthquake belts , lose little sleep on account of this eternal menace to their safety . They till their fields and play with their children and eat their meals and laugh at Charlie Chaplin just like the rest of us . The experience of ages has taught them to build a kind of cardboard house which is perhaps a little draughty in winter but which causes the minimum of danger when it comes tumbling down about its owner 's ears . Of course , when they want to imitate the west and build sky-scrapers as they did in Tokio , then the damage runs into the hundreds of millions . But , generally speaking , Japan has adapted itself better than any other country to this inevitable geological handicap . Just as , generally speaking , they seem to have succeeded in making life a much more harmonious and agreeable adventure than most of Japan  | the nations of the west . I am not thinking of the pretty postal cards with little geisha girls drinking tea underneath a cherry tree , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what all travellers have told us who visited Japan before it gave up its ancestral customs and habits and manners ( the manners especially seem to have been exquisite ) and tried to turn its islands into suburbs of Chicago and Wilkes-Barre . As that incredible change from the old Japan unto the new has had a very decided influence upon our own safety and happiness and will continue to do so in an increasing manner , we ought to know at least a few things about these people who , whether we like it or not , will be our neighbors as long as the Pacific does not run dry . Japanese history is of much more recent date than Chinese . The Chinese calendar goes back to 2637 B. C. ( about the time Cheops was building his little pyramid ) but the oldest Japanese chronicle dates back only to 400 A. D. At that time the present so-called Japanese race was already in existence . Strictly speaking , however , there is no " Japanese race " , for , like the English , the Japanese are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually driven to the more remote northern islands by three successive waves of invaders from southern China and the Malayan peninsula , from central China , and from Manchuria and Korea . As a result , the original civilization of Japan was really an extension of Chinese civilization , and whatever the Japanese knew they had learned from the Chinese . Their relations with China grew even more intimate when Japan followed the Chinese example and allowed herself to be converted to Buddhism . But when a new creed replaces an older one , the new creed can not help being influenced to a certain extent at least by the older one . That is a lesson all missionaries have been obliged to learn , whether they preached Christianity , Mohammedanism or Buddhism . The first Buddhist apostles who reached Japan in the sixth century of our era found that the Japanese had developed a re-  | ligious system of their own which had grown out of the soil , so to speak , and which was very well suited to their needs . It was called Shinto-ism from the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the divine pathway " . It was a much nobler creed than the spook and devil worship so prevalent all over the rest of Asia . It accepted the world as a unit of indestructible force and taught that we are responsible for whatever use we make of that force , because , no matter how insignificant the result may be , it will be a permanent result . The present official creed of Japan is a mixture of Buddhism and Shinto-ism . It lays great stress upon one 's duty towards the community at large . Like the Englishman , the Japanese , who is also essentially an island-dweller ( without necessarily being an insular person ) , has a very sincere and deep-seated conviction that he owes his country certain very definite duties . Shinto-ism also lays stress upon the respect due the ancestors . But it does not carry this veneration to the point of absurdity which turns so much of China into a vast cemetery where the dead rule the living and where the grave-yards occupy the space that should be used to raise food for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese civilization did not take place until much later , not until the latter half of the sixteenth century when , after an endless period of quarrelling and fighting between little independent potentates who paid no more attention to their emperor than a knight of the Holy Roman Empire did to his , the government fell at last into the hands of a man of power . Eight hundred years before , in far away Europe , the Major Domos or house-stewards of the old Frankish kings had pushed their masters into a monastery and had then taken it upon themselves to rule the country . As they were much better fitted for the job than the men they replaced , nobody had objected . The Japanese people , having endured civil war for almost four centuries , did not care who ruled them as long as they got peace . And so they did not object or rush to the defence of their hereditary rulers when the highest official of the imperial court , the  | head of the rich and influential Tokugawa family , made himself the dictator of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a sort of deity on earth , the spiritual father of all the Japanese , but of such remote spiritual perfection that , like the Lamas of Tibet , he must forever remain invisible to the mass of his subjects . This arrangement lasted almost two entire centuries . The Shoguns ( for that was the title by which these dictators were known and it meant as much as our " commander-in-chief " ) ruled in Tokio and the Emperors idled their time away behind their costly screens in the silent palace of Kioto . It was during the Shogun era that Japan adopted that strict feudal system which was to influence the character of her people in so profound a way that even today , after almost eighty years of industrialism , the Japanese are still feudalists at heart , and contemplate the problems of life from an angle that is totally different from that of their European and American competitors . It took some time to perfect the details of this new arrangement , but after the year 160o Japanese society was divided definitely into three different groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the members of the feudal nobility , the big landowners . The second one consisted of the Samurai , hereditary warriors corresponding to the knights of medieval Europe . All other people belonged to the third class , that of the Heimin or commoners . This system was not ideal but history has quite convincingly taught us that the mass of the population is never deeply interested in any theory of government . All the average citizen asks is , " Does it work ? Does it guarantee me peace and quiet and give me the assurance that whatever I have gained through my own efforts and in the sweat of my brow will actually belong to me and that no one can take it away from me without due process of law ? " And for more than two centuries the system did work . The Shogun was recognized as the political leader of the state . The Mikado was worshipped as the spiritual head of the nation . The  | Daimyos and the Samurai , forced to adhere to a very strict code of " noblesse oblige " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politely requested to disembowel themselves according to the most solemn rites of hara-kiri . And the subjects labored at their different trades and professions . Even then the country was getting to be slightly over-crowded . Often the people were obliged to subsist on very little . But they had always been very sober and frugal in their tastes and did not ask for much . And Nature appeared to be a faithful friend . The Kuro Siwo ( which means the Blue Salt Current , a sort of second cousin to our own Gulf Stream ) which started in the equatorial region just north of the Dutch East Indies , then flowed past the Philippines and then crossed the Pacific to bestow its blessings upon the west coast of America , provided the country with an even climate . A narrow strip of cold water just off the Japanese east coast prevented the country from enjoying quite as mild a temperature as California , but even so it was much better off than continental China . Everything , so it seemed , was in favor of a normal and rational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Portuguese navigator who had lost his bearings , appeared upon the scene and upset the entire future course of Japanese history . For the Portuguese not only visited distant countries to trade with them , but also to bring them the enlightened blessings of their own religious system . At first , unless all chronicles have agreed to lie upon this one point , the Christian missionaries , whose headquarters were in Goa in India and in Macao near Canton in China , were received with great courtesy and were given every opportunity to explain the advantages of their own creed over that which for so long had ruled supreme among the Japanese . They preached their gospel and they made many converts . Then other missionaries , belonging to a different religious order , arrived from the nearby Philippine Islands which belonged to Spain . They too were welcomed , but the Shogun began to feel uneasy about their presence when he discovered ( what native  | prince has ever failed to make that discovery sooner or later ? ) that these holy men were invariably accompanied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange iron rods that would send heavy leaden bullets through as many as three common Japanese soldiers at the same time . It is only during the last fifty years that we have begun to Caption understand the Japanese point of view about the very painful incidents which thereupon happened . These incidents have given the Japanese a reputation for cold-blooded cruelty which did not seem in the least in keeping with what we had learned about them from other sources . The decision of the Shogun to close Japan against all further activities on the part of the Christian missionaries was not the result of any sudden dislike on his part for the people from the west . It was caused by fear , by fear lest the whole country be rent asunder by religious strife and its riches  | be despoiled by the captains of those same merchantmen that carried the messengers of peace and good-will to the shores of Japan and then departed without paying for the goods that had been ordered to provide a return cargo . The Jesuit influence had been strongest in the island of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first the Fathers had humbly spoken of the Prince of Peace . As soon as they had gained the upper hand , they began to destroy Japanese temples , demolish Japanese images and force thousands of peasants and nobles to accept the cross at the point of the gun . Toyotomi Hideyoshi , then the strong man of Japan , saw all this and realized what the inevitable end must be . " These priests , " so he announced , " came here preaching virtue , but their virtue is only a means of concealing their pernicious designs against our Empire . " On July 25th of the year 1587 , five years after a first Japanese embassy had paid its respects to the Pope and to the Kings of Spain and Portugal , all Christian priests were banished from Japanese territory . Merchants were given permission to visit Japan as before , but under supervision of the government . The Portuguese Jesuits left . Their place was immediately taken by Spanish Franciscans and Dominicans from the nearby Philippines . They came disguised as special ambassadors to Hideyoshi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with courtesy but were told not to preach . They disobeyed this order , built themselves a church in Yedo and began to baptise people all over the land . Next they built a church in Osaka . Next they appropriated a church in Nagasaki which had belonged to the Jesuits . Next they turned openly against their rivals , the Jesuits , and accused them of having been too conciliatory in their methods of bringing the Good Tidings to the Japanese . In short , they committed every error of judgment and taste to be found in the repertory of professional fanatics . When they were finally deported by Hideyoshi 's orders , they returned as fast as they were expelled . After years of futile warnings , the Japanese , who thus far had shown the- utmost patience and tolerance towards these  | unwelcome Spanish friars , came to the conclusion that nothing could save them but the most drastic of measures . Rather than witness a repetition of that civil war which had been so disastrous to their country during the previous four hundred years , they voluntarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those Christian missionaries who disregarded that edict were put to death . During wellnigh a century and a half Japan remained in a state of voluntary exile from the rest of the world . Almost , but not completely . One little window remained open through which a great deal of Japanese gold flowed westward and through which at least a few scraps of western science penetrated into the interior of that strange country . The Dutch East India Company had been a rival of the Portuguese for Japan 's commercial favors . But the Dutch were traders , pure and simple , and had but little  | interest in other peoples ' souls . Neither did the English . For a long time it was a toss-up which of the two nations would win out . But the English managed rather badly on this occasion , and lost . After the execution of the last of a series of Portuguese diplomatic missions sent to Japan , an inexcusable official murder , the Dutch too were deprived of many of their former privileges . But as long as their Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they decided to hang on . They were forced to reside on the little island of Deshima , a square rock 300 yards long and 8o yards wide , situated in the harbor of Nagasaki and hardly big enough to exercise the dogs they brought with them to keep them company . They were not allowed to bring their wives and were never permitted to set foot on the mainland . They must for once have exercised the patience of the angels ( not exactly a national characteristic ) for the slightest infringement of any of the hundreds of regulations , laid down by the Japanese authorities , brought immediate reprisals . One day the East India Company decided to build a new storehouse . The date , according to the custom of the times , was painted on the facade with the usual prefix A. D. or " anno Domini " . As this was a direct reference to the Dominus of those Christians whom the Japanese had come to regard as we ourselves regard Bolshevist agitators fresh from Moscow , the Shogun gave orders not only to remove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raze it to the ground and to remind the Dutch of that terrible edict of expulsion of the Portuguese which had ended with the words : " As long as the sun warms the earth , let no Christian be so bold as to come to Japan and let all people know that if King Philip himself or even the very God of the Christians break this commandment , they shall pay for it with their heads . " The officials of the Dutch East India Company seem to have aken the lesson to heart , because Deshima remained in Dutch hands for 217 years . During those 217 years there was a steady  | drain of Japanese gold and silver , for the Dutch were cash traders and whatever the Japanese ordered from abroad had to be paid for on delivery . In this way , too , Europe got an occasional bit of news from these hermits of the Pacific . These stories are agreed that conditions in the Empire were far from satisfactory . Japan was rapidly becoming an object lesson of the doctrine that no nation can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end , too , the youth of Japan were beginning to grow increasingly restive . They had heard vague stories about the wonderful science of western Europe . They began to book-leg scientific and medical works by way of Deshima . They spelled out queer Dutch words and learned that the world at large had been moving at a terrific pace while Japan alone had stood still . Then in 1847 the King of Holland sent a trunkful of scientific books to the court of Yedo as a present , together with a map of the world , warning the Japanese against the further folly of isolation . All this time commercial relations between China and Europe and America were rapidly on the increase . Vessels bound from San Francisco for Canton sometimes suffered shipwreck on the Japanese coast and the sailors , being without consular or diplomatic protection , fared rather badly . In 1849 the captain of an American man-of-war threatened to bombard Nagasaki unless eighteen American seamen were returned to him at once . Once more the King of Holland warned his Japanese colleague against the dangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These letters from the Hague merely expressed what all the world had long since known . Sooner or later , Japan would have to open her doors to western commerce , and if she refused to do so peaceably she would be obliged to do so by force . Russia , which was pushing further and further down the coast of Alaska , was slowly making plans to increase its hold upon the western Pacific . The only country that could act without being suspected of having territorial ambitions was America . In 1853 Commodore Perry with four warships and 56o men entered  | Uraga Bay . This first visit caused such a panic as Japan had never experienced . The Emperor officially invoked the aid of Heaven and as soon as Perry was gone ( he remained only ten days to deliver a letter from the President to the Emperor ) the Dutch were requested to furnish a warship , forts were manned , old Portuguese guns were mounted and everything was done to prepare for a second visit of these steam-propelled monsters from the east . All over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in favor of isolation at all costs , but others declared for the policy of the open door . The Shogun , belonging to the latter , lost much of his power and was denounced as a " friend of the foreigners " . But in the end it was the Emperor who benefited most from that ever-famous visit of Admiral Perry . The Shogunate , as the undisputed head of an absolutely feudal system of government , had long since outlived its own usefulness , as had those Daimyos and Samurai who still insisted upon carrying their swords as if they lived in 1653 instead of 1853 and were still actually engaged in the laudable task of suppressing civil war . It was time for a change all along the line . By mere chance it so happened that the Emperor , who was then the nominal head of the nation , was also a young man of extraordinary ability and great intelligence . He prevailed upon the Shogun to resign and once more took hold of the reins of government . He let himself be persuaded that further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cordially as before that he had repelled them . And the Meiji , or era of enlightenment which he inaugurated , changed Japan from a sixteenth century feudal state into a modern , industrialized nation . To ask whether such a complete reversion of feelings on such a tremendous scale is ever a good and desirable thing for any people is to pose a useless question . Factories and large armies and large navies and coal mines and steel foundries may make for happiness or they may not . I do n't know . Some say yes and others say no . It will always . depend a great deal upon the individuals in question . The Russians , ten years ago , nursed their  | souls and loved their saints . Today they burn their saints in the kitchen stove and their souls now dwell with perfect contentment in the exhaust pipe of an engine . Personally I believe that such developments are absolutely inevitable . In themselves they are neither absolutely good nor absolutely bad because they are necessary and are part of that development by which we hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fear of economic uncertainty . That the machine , who is both the father and the mother of such a change , also destroys a great deal that is desirable and beautiful , no one will dare to deny . That the Japan of Hokusai and Utamaro would have been a much more interesting country to visit than the Japan of the Japanese standard oil and the Tokio gasworks , is undoubtedly true . But Hokusai and Utamaro are dead and gone and the Tokio housewives prefer cooking on gas to cooking over a slow charcoal fire ; and that is the answer . Fujiyama , the venerable white-haired volcano which has not spoken a word since 1707 , now looks down upon cigarette ads where formerly little children offered flowers to a wayside shrine . The holy deer in the temple park hurt their feet on tin cans thrown away by careless picnic parties . But Fuji knows ? some day , this too will come to an end .  | THE PHILIPPINES , AN OLD ADMINISTRATIVE PART OF MEXICO THE Philippines belong to that row of islands which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits of dry land are remnants of the outer edge of the old continent . They were high enough to remain above sea-level when the waters of the Pacific covered the bottom of those valleys since then known as the Sea of Japan , the East China Sea and the South China Sea . There are more than 7000 islands in the Philippine group , but only 462 of these are bigger than a square mile . The others are merely large cliffs or little bits of marshland , so insignificant that only one-quarter of them have even been given a name . All of them together are about as large as England and Scotland and they have a population of t t , 000,000 natives , with a very large number of Chinese and Japanese and about too , 000 whites . This whole group at one time must have been highly volcanic although today we can only locate twenty-five real volcanoes . Even those , with two or three exceptions , seem to have stopped working at their trade . For this we ought to be duly grateful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view . The deepest hole in the ocean which we have so far been able to locate lies just east of the Philippines . That is the spot of which I told you and which is so deep that if we used it as a burial ground for the Himalayas , Mount Everest , the highest mountain of our planet , would still be 3000 feet under water . If things should ever begin to slide in that little corner of the world , there would be few left to tell the tale . The most important of the Philippine islands is Luzon . It has  | the shape of a pollywog and in the center rises to a height of 7000 feet . The most important city and the capital of the whole group is situated on the east coast of Luzon , and its name is Manila . The Spaniards founded it in 1571 , on the ruins of an old Mohammedan settlement , and it is called after a weed , the nilad , which grew abundantly all over the place . In the year 1590 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enduring than the rule of those who built them . But even under the bad Spanish management , Manila soon developed into the most important commercial center of the whole Far East . The harbor was full of boats from China and Japan and India and even from faraway Arabia . They came to this port to exchange their merchandise for those European products which the Spaniards had brought to the Philippines by way of their Mexican possessions in Central America . For , rather than risk the voyage across the Indian Ocean and by way of the Cape , which would have exposed them to the attacks of the British and the Dutch , the Spaniards sent their vessels directly from Manila to the Gulf of Tehuantepec , then carried the goods across the American isthmus , and on the other side reloaded them into vessels that sailed for home by way of Cuba and Porto Rico . To the south of Luzon lie a dozen fairly large islands of which Samar and Panay ( with the well-known city of Iloilo , the second largest city of the Philippines ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south of these lies Mindanao , only a little smaller than Luzon , and famous for the stubborn resistance with which the natives , the Mohammedan Moros , have fought both Spaniard and American to retain their independence . The biggest city of Mindanao is Zamboanga , which faces the Sulu Sea , for , generally speaking , the Philippines have always turned their back upon the Pacific . Their real interests lay in the west , they traded with the west , and it was from the west that they got their religion and their first concepts of civilization . That they were discovered by people who approached them from the east was pure accident .  | Magellan , who landed here in 1521 , had merely taken this unusual route to settle a point of law that was threatening difficulties between his employer , the King of Spain , and the Pope . In the year 1494 the Pope , in order to make an end to all further strife between his beloved children of the Iberian peninsula had taken a ruler and had divided the whole world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north to the south just west of the Azores and the Cape Verde Islands ( roughly corresponding to our fiftieth degree of longitude west of Greenwich ) . He had given the Spaniards everything to the west of that line and the Portuguese everything to the east . That was the famous treaty of Tordesillas upon which the Spaniards based their right to execute all those who dared to pass " beyond the line " and which made the first English and Dutch expeditions to the American mainland such very hazardous enterprises , for whoever was caught " beyond the line " was immediately hanged like a common pirate . The Pope , however , who had made this venture into applied geography , the notorious Alexander VI. , the father of Cesare and Lucrezia Borgia , was himself a Spaniard ; and the Portuguese claimed that the treaty had not been quite fair to their interests . Hence a century of wrangling and fighting as to who owned what . In connection with this quarrel , Magellan , although a Portuguese , had been hired by the King of Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastern route and to decide whether the rich spice islands of the Moluccas lay within that part of the Indies which the Pope had given to the Portuguese or to the Spaniards . The Portuguese proved to be right . They got the Moluccas , which shortly afterwards they lost to the Dutch , but the Spaniards , who had come upon the Philippines in this accidental way , kept them for their own benefit and administered them from Mexico . This meant a wholesale exodus of friars from the New Castile to a territory that promised more profitable results than would ever be obtained among the fast dwindling races of Central America . The friars , it must be confessed , did a thorough job among  | their Filipino charges . Indeed , if they had only been a little less successful , our own task in the Philippines would have been a good deal easier . For when we acquired those ancient Spanish possessions in the year 1898 , we were for the first time in our political existence called upon to deal with a people who were almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestant nation in the official sense of the word , but our general philosophy of life is decidedly Protestant and very decidedly un-Catholic . We may be inspired by the best of intentions towards the Philippines , give them endless good roads , thousands of schools , three universities , hospitals , doctors , nurses , incubators , meat and fish inspection , hygiene and a thousand and one benefits of progress of which the Spaniards had never even heard . But all these generous expressions of goodwill mean comparatively little to people who from their earliest childhood have been taught to regard such worldly comforts and advantages as something very nice and very pleasant but not to be compared to the chance of gaining salvation in another world , where hygiene and hospitals and good roads and schools shall no longer be of any interest to anybody .  | THE DUTCH EAST INDIES , THE TAIL THAT WAGS THE DOG I HAVE already told you how Japan and Formosa and the Philippines are merely the outer mountainous edges of the old Asiatic continent which in the course of millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pacific Ocean . The Malay Islands on the other hand ( Malaysia , Insulinde , Indian Archipelago , the Dutch East Indies ? they are known by so many different names ) are not merely part of the old outer edge of Asia . They are the remnants of an enormous peninsula as large as that of China , which reached from Burma and Siam and Cochin-China eastward to Australia . During the earliest ages of our geographical history this peninsula may have been directly connected with the Asiatic continent ( then infinitely larger than today ) and afterwards , during a period about which we are a little better informed , it was separated from Australia only by a narrow strip of water , not much wider than the present Torres Strait between Queensland and New Guinea . The reason for the cataclysmic changes which have turned so vast a piece of dry land into a group of oddly shaped islands , running all the way from Borneo , which is as large as the whole of the Scandinavian peninsula , down to thousands of tiny bits of rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is not hard to discover . This part of the world was among the most volcanic regions of the earth . Even today Java retains the blue ribbon for volcanic activities . During the last three centuries , however , the hundred and twenty odd volcanoes of Java have on the whole been very well-behaved , as have those of Sumatra , a little towards the west .  | When Brahmanism , the old religion of India , was prevalent among the Javanese , the priests used to placate the spirits that dwelled in the bowels of the earth by an occasional offering of human beings , who were pitched bodily into the boiling cauldron of the craters ? apparently with success , for although the volcanoes continue to puff and roar and occasionally go on a rampage , there has been no major catastrophe for several centuries . But the remnants of Krakatoa lie there as a dreadful warning of something that may happen again at any moment . On the morning of the 26th of August of the year 1883 the island of Krakatoa , situated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it had always been since a prehistoric eruption had blown away the top of its crater and had cut the island up into several small pieces . Two days later , the whole northern part of the island was gone . Where there had been hills 1 500 feet high there now was a deep hollow , lying more than a thousand feet below the surface of the Indian Ocean . The noise of that explosion was heard 3000 miles away . Ashes were blown 17 miles up in the air . The volcanic dust spread all over Africa , Europe , Asia and America and even as far north as the North Cape . The sky for six weeks afterwards was strangely colored as if there had been a forest fire somewhere in the neighborhood . But the disturbance caused on the ocean was much more disastrous than that caused on land , for Krakatoa was uninhabited . A tidal wave more than 50 feet high swept along the coast of Java and killed 36,000 people . It wiped out harbors and villages and destroyed large vessels as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected by these waves . They made themselves noticeable near Cape Horn , which is almost 8000 miles away , and they were faintly observed in the British Channel which is 11,000 miles distant from the Strait of Sunda . A year ago the remnant of the Krakatoa volcano was once more beginning to show signs of activity . And no one can foretell when or where the subterranean lightning will strike next . As for the people who live here , they are like all the others who  | live under similar circumstances . They pay no more attention than a small boy in one of our tenement districts pays to the trucks that are driven right across his baseball game in one of the most crowded streets of the Italian quarter . Caption This fatalistic attitude may be due to the Mohammedan faith . It may also be the result of just plain ordinary contentment with life and the conviction that volcanic eruptions , like foreign dominations or floods or fires , are all of them negligible incidents in life and of small importance to the man who tills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world have tilled these same fields , whose children will till these same fields , and
