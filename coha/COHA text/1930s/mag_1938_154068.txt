Election Day in the U. S. is followed by wash day . Dirty linen aired in campaigns , or kept out of sight until afterward , goes into the tub and comes out through the wringer . Last week saw political laundries worked overtime . Most notable part of the week 's wash was another big indictment by New York City 's crusading paladin , District Attorney Tom Dewey ( see p. 13 ) . Elsewhere : <P> Donat J. Levesque , Democratic mayor ot sedate Lewiston . Me. , was indicted on a charge of accepting a $200 bribe in connection with the appointment of a city health officer . <P> New Jersey 's supreme court upheld indictments of Meyer C. Ellenstein , Democratic mayor of Newark , N. J. , and 29 other persons charged with fraudulent municipal land deals . <P> Mayor Samuel Davis Wilson of Philadelphia , an off- &-on; Republican , issued invitations to Republican Governor-elect James of Pennsylvania and other interested parties to come and discuss the third city 's financial plight . Mayor Wilson revealed that his deficit now tunes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week was the quashing , by Common Pleas Judge Harry S. McDevitt , of 21 indictments charging him with misbehavior in office . <P> Following vote-fraud charges by Governor-reject Tom Dewey during the campaign , Governor-re-elect Lehman of New York ordered a special grand-jury investigation of balloting in Albany County-the one upstate county carried by Mr. Lehman . <P> Mr. Dewey charged that the county 's registration of 82,000 was larger than its adult population . The total votes for Governor last fortnight amounted to 94% of this registration and Mr. Lehman 's plurality was more than 20,000 . Albany County politics are administered by the Democratic brother bosses , Daniel P. and Edward J. O'Connell . <P> A juicy bit of post-election hellzapoppin was promised by Representative Joseph W. Martin of Massachusetts , prospective Republican floor leader of the House in the 76th Congress . He said last week that an investigation had been launched into the qualifications of Dr. Rudolph G. ( " Dr. Ten " ) Tenerowicz , Democratic Congressman-elect and mayor of Hamtramck , Mich . <P> Before election Republicans did not assail the Doctor 's qualifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Roxborough , Negro , brother of Heavyweight Champion Joe Louis ' comanager , John Roxborough . Governor Frank Murphy thought well enough of Dr. Ten to be photographed during the campaign handshaking him ( see cut ) . <P> Hamtramck ( pronounced Ham-tram-mick ) is Detroit 's tenderloin for foreign immigrants . It got its municipal charter in 1922 and is today Michigan 's seventh city . <P> Thither from Chicago went Dr. Tenerowicz in 1923 , because he heard it was a " promising city " where thousands of Poles " needed guidance . " Dr. Ten was a one-time breaker-boy from the coal mines of Punxsutawney , Pa. ( pronounced Punk-soo-tawney ) . He had studied medicine at Loyola University , served in the Army Medical Corps . Eloquent and energetic , combining politics with doctoring like Michigan 's late Royal S. Copeland , who became Senator from New York , Dr. Ten was only five years in becoming Hamtramck 's mayor .
