29 G TE afternoon when the President had walked across the street to Mr. Lloyd George 's apartment , I opened a consignment of home papers that had just arrived . In one was an article saying that the only constructive work of the American delegation had been done while President Wilson was away and Colonel House in charge . The Colonel was described as the " brains of the commission . " A tap at the door interrupted my read  --  ing . I said , " Come in , " and Colonel House appeared . " I came to see the Governor , " he said , " and , finding him out , thought you would let me talk to you until he came back . " " Do come in , " I said , " for you are al  --  ways so busy I never see you . " He took off his overcoat and put it . on the sofa ; then drew up a chair near the fire and began to talk over the difficulties of the work they were doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a thought beyond that of feeling he would be as dis  --  tressed as I was over the article in the paper I had just put down , I picked it up and said : " Colonel , have you been reading these awful attacks on Woodrow , or have you been too busy ? Just listen to this , which I know you will resent . " ? I read several paragraphs aloud . The Colonel 's face turned crimson . " Has the Governor seen that article ? " he asked . " No , it has just come , " I replied . He sprang up , and taking his coat in one hand , beheld out the other , saying : " Pleaselet me have that to read After all , I will not wait for the Governor . " " Why , " I said , " I thought you said you wanted to see him ! " By this time Colonel House had reached the door , through which he fled as though pursued . I was still sitting wondering about what had happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him how Colonel House had acted . " What do you make of it ? " I asked . " Mrs. Wilson , " he said , " I did not want to worry you or the President with it , but everyone is talking about these articles , and the gossip is that Gordon Auchincloss Colonel House 's son-in-lawl is inspiring them . Feeling just as you did , that the Colonel would he the first to resent such a thing if he knew it , I went to him a week ago and talked to him about it , and came away feeling that the gossip was correct . Several of our friends among the news  --  paper people have told me that the man who writes these articles is always in the Colonel 's room and gets his tips straight from him . " " I don't. believe it , Doctor Grayson , " I answered , " for if it were true , Colonel House would be a traitor . " " Well , " he said , " I even went so far as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said There is nothing in it . I rarely see the man . ' But , by a strange coinci  --  dence , the next day the newspaperman who had told me about it asked if I had done anything to draw it to the attention of the Colonel . I ( Contlewed an Page 31 ) ( Continued front Page 29 ) told him I had , and the Colonel 's answer . At that , my newspaper friend said : ' Well , do you mind coming up on the roof with me ? ' " This was at the Hotel Crillon , where our commis  --  sion was housed . Doctor Grayson went to the roof , where a photographer had his camera set up and was taking pictures of Colonel House and the writer of the articles , standing with their arms around each other 's shoulders . Doctor Grayson added : " When they saw me , the Colonel dropped his friend and said , That is enough , ' and quickly left the scene . " When my husband came in , I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspaper article , but not what Doctor Grayson had said . " Oh , I am sorry you hurt House , " exclaimed Woodrow . " I would as soon doubt your loyalty as his . All this is another attempt to misrepresent things at home . " All my husband had against the Colonel at this time was what he regarded as a grave error in judg  --  ment in failing to stand up against men with whom he wished to be on intimate terms . I remember hav  --  ing said : " Oh , if Colonel House had only stood firm while you were away , none of this would have to be done over . I think he is a perfect jellyfish . " To which M r.Wilson had replied : " Well , God made jellyfish , so , as Shakespeare said about a man , there  --  fore let him pass , and do n't be too hard on House . It takes a pretty stiff spinal column to stand against the elements centered here , " Nevertheless , the conversation of the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last with Colonel House . He did not come to our house again except for business meetings at which others were present , and on these occasions I did not see him . Sometime later . when I was recovering from an infected foot , Colonel House sent me a cluster of my favorite orchids . As was our custom , I thanked him by telephone instead of writing a note . That com  --  munication was our last by word of mouth . The Battle for Fiume H owwished there was some way I could share the ever-increasing burdens . Every hour of my husband 's time was claimed , and when the night con  --  ferences were over he would turn to a desk filled with demands from Washington . I waited up until the grind ceased and , as he ate almost nothing at table , I would have a glass of milk and some tiny sandwiches provided . At first the old maitre d'hCitel brought three sandwiches about the size of a silver dollar . After two or three nights he reduced them to two , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my husband ate only one , but , lest French thrift use this as an excuse for reducing our ration again , I con  --  cealed the true state of affairs by giving the extra sandwich to the doughboy on guard outside our door . Italy 's great grievance was Fiume . Mr. Wilson had steadfastly refused to give this port to Italy , on the ground that , by right of nationality , it belonged to the new Jugo-Slay state . France and England concurred , but let Wilson do most of the fighting . On a Saturday , Orlando , Clemenceau , Balfour and my husband met at our house for a final discussion . Or  --  lando remained obdurate . The meeting adjourned with the understanding that C'lemenceau , Balfour and my husband were each to give to the press a statement of his country 's view of the question . All Sunday forenoon the President worked on his statement , for , realizing the seriousness of the mat  --  ter , he wished to make things clear not only at home but in Italy as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken into . About lunchtime , when the draft was ready to be typed , a messenger arrived from Mr. Balfour saying , as he had not had time to write his statement , would President Wilson kindly permit him to have a copy of what he had written to use as an outline . This my husband did , and on the Wednesday following gave a copy to the press as agreed . Next morning the President 's statement was on the front page of every paper at home and abroad , but not one word from either Balfour or Clemenceau . A deluge of adverse comment came from the Italian Commission  --  all directed against my husband . He was white with anger . Upon his seeking an explana  --  tion , the smug answer was that , after seeing President Wilson 's paper , Mr. Balfour had conferred with M. Clemenceau , whereupon both felt that Wilson had made such a fine exposition of the situation that nothing they could add would strengthen the case against Italy ; so they had agreed to make no state  --  ment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ un  --  popular decision in Italy , they decided to hide behind the President and shirk responsibility . With all the dramatic ostentation of a scene from an Italian opera . Orlando summoned a train and pre  --  pared to abandon the conference and go back to his people with this tale of outrageous treatment at the hands of the President of the United Stales . Just before he boarded the train , a statement written by Mr. Balfour , confirming the stand of England and France in the denial of Fiume to Italy was handed to Signor Orlando . Mr. Balfour did not give this to the papers , however . Orlando did not give it to the papers . Italy 's fury , and that of the reactionary elements in France , England and even the United States , con  --  tinued to be directed at Mr. Wilson alone . Affairs of this kind prompted stories that Mr. Wil  --  son did not understand European diplomacy and could not cope with 01 ( 1 World statesmen . I thank God that there is some truth in the statement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , as he saw them , and I think the world realizes now that the ends of all would have been better served if more of his views had prevailed . Orlando Returns to the Conference T HROUGHOUT Italy pictures of the President were torn down and the candles that were burn  --  ing in front of them extinguished . Clemenceau and Lloyd George worked on Mr. Wilson to relent on Fiume . He refused , and there was nothing for Orlando to do but come back , in case he wished to sign the treaty , which was then nearing completion . His arrival was as dramatic as his departure , though unconsciously so . Clemenceau and Lloyd George were in my husband 's study . Mr. Wilson told me that at the moment Orlando was announced , Lloyd George was loudly denouncing him as a quit  --  ter . The President really liked Orlando , and , on questions where Italy 's interests were not involved , had received useful and enlightened support from him . The little Italian seemed so crestfallen that my husband tried to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orlando did not understand English beyond a few phrases . On this occasion this was fortunate , for otherwise Lloyd George 's words would have made the meeting more awkward than it was . After my husband 's cheerful greeting , Orlando brightened up and asked innocently : " Mr. President , what subject are you met to discuss this morning ? " The President an  --  swered : " Well , Mr. Orlando , we are stilt trying to get Fiume on the map . " Orlando walked over to a win  --  dow , and , pressing his face against the glass , began to weep . " Poor fellow , " said my husband , telling me the story , " of course his government had given him the devil , and I Felt sorry , ( Continued on Page 33 ) ( Centinued fr.n . Pug* 31 ) for him . So I went over to the window and told him it was no lack of tact and ability on his part , but just the very stern necessity we were all under to try and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's claim . I led him gently back to his accus  --  tomed chair , feeling as though he were a little boy and that I ought to take out my handkerchief and dry his tears . " Not long after the meeting was over I received a basket of wonderful or  --  chids , with Signor Orlando 's card at  --  tached . At long last the treaty was done , and on May seventh it was formally pre  --  sented to the Germans at Versailles . Immediately began the desperate effort of the Germans to obtain a relaxation of the terms  --  in some respects unmis  --  takably harsh . On the matter of repa  --  rations , especially , my husband be  --  lieved France and England had gone too far . They had imposed indemnities far beyond the capacity of Germany to pay , especially in view of industrial restrictions which would hamper the beaten nation 's economic recovery . All these matters , my husband thought , would properly come before the League of Nations for adjustment after the passions engendered by the war had cooled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were given more lime . Then the original delegation was called home to be replaced by another . While this change is being made , I will go back a little to tell of the arrival in Paris of Her Majesty , the Queen of Rumania . She stayed at the Ritz Hotel with her two daughters , then young ladies  --  afterward the Queens of Jugoslavia and of Greece  --  her sister , the Infanta of Spain . and ladies and gentlemen in waiting . She immediately sent a mes  --  sage saying she would like to receive us as early as possible . We found Her Majesty in a soft gray dress which , with her blond hair and blue eyes , was very becoming . She was alone , and at once plunged into the claims of Ru  --  mania at the conference , insisting upon going into great details . She reviewed the new Russian laws concerning sex  --  ual relations , saying the proximity of Russia to her country made the menace very real . At first my husband listened cour  --  teously and attentively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Permit me to assure Your Majesty that all this was conveyed to me through dis  --  patches long before I left the United States , and it has been thoroughly con  --  sidered by the conference . Also your Prime Minister , M. Bratianu , has faithfully presented Rumania 's case . So it is useless for me to claim more of your time regarding it . " An Embarrassing Queen He rose to end the interview . She put her hand on his arm , trying to re-seat him on the sofa beside her , and in dulcet tones said : " Oh , Bratianu l He is not getting anywhere with such men as you . " When my husband did not yield , the Queen tried another tack . Lifting from the mantelpiece a photo  --  graph of a dark-haired girl of ten or twelve years , she held it up to him , say  --  ing : " This , Mr. President , is a picture of my youngest daughter , Ileana . My Jove child , I call her . Is she not lovely ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she  --  oh , she is dark and passionate . " By the time she had finished speak  --  ing we were all standing , waiting to say good-by  --  which we did very promptly , THE SATURDAY and she escorted tie to the elevator . When we got in the ear Admiral Gray  --  son , who as naval aide to the Presi  --  dent had . accompanied us , said : " Well , in all my experience I have never heard a lady talk about such things . I hon  --  estly did not know where to look , I was HO embarrassed . " " Yes , " I said , " I could not help watching you with great amusement , for you seemed to shrink with each new word she said , until you grew smaller and smaller before my very eyes . " My husband said nothing . So I looked around and , seeing his jaw set , knew this very beautiful woman had met one man whom she had failed to charm . A few days later I met her again at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a hive of workers teaehirig the poor mutilates of the war how to start life again , maimed or blind . She hailed me sweetly and graciously , and I could not suppress an admission to myself that her beauty made her seem an ideal Queen . " What day can you and the Presi  --  dent come to dinner with me ? " she asked . I told her that , unfortunately , we neither lunched nor dined out . She in  --  sisted , and I firmly declined . ' ' Then I will propose myself to lunch with you , " she said . " You ca n't he so rude as to tell me not to come . Shall it be tomorrow ? " " No , " I said . " There is a long and important conference for my husband tomorrow ; let us say the following day at one o'clock . " " Good , " she answered . " I will he there with my two girls , my sister , and one or two of my gentlemen . " This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed it was not possible to refuse her . As usual , many things claimed him , but he had put them aside to be ready to join me at the door to welcome the Queen . We waited up in the drawing room , from which we could see her car approach . We were talking , and happy to be to  --  gether , and did not notice the time un  --  til the big French clock on the mantel struck the first . quarter of the hour . " Surely , " I said , " that must he wrong . 1 told her one o'clock , and that says a quarter past . " My husband consulted his watch . " Yes , " he said , " that is right , and I have an appointment at two-thirty . " At 1:30 she still had not come , and the President said : " Como , lot 's go in EVENING POST to lunch . This is extremely rude , and we are not called upon to delay any longer . " As we went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on either side of the door , at the top and bot  --  tom of the stairs , and at the entrance . When we were halfway downstairs , with a great throbbing of motor engines the party arrived , thirty-five minutes late . There were five ladies and five gentle  --  men , led by the Queen , who clasped both my husband 's hands in affected repentance for being late . On May thirtieth I went . on crutches , owing to an infected foot , to the Amer  --  ican military cemetery at Suresnes , where the President was to make a . Memorial Day address . In the center of the cemetery on a small platform stood the President , his head bared  --  and how white the hair had grown those last few months  --  his tall , slight form tense with emotion as he spoke to the living and for the dead in a passion  --  ate plea-to end all wars and never again make such sacrifice necessary . When the speech was finished , people Were sobbing . For myself , I could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for my husband 's control had also broken and only by supreme effort had he been able to finish his speech . This man , whom the world some  --  times judged cold , had a heart that bled with every drop that was shed by the boys he had to send to their death in the hope of saving humanity . How many times I have thought of that May day and wondered , if men like Mr. Henry Cabot Lodge and his sup  --  porters in the Senate could have been there for just that hour , would they have dared vote against any instru  --  ment. , such as the League of Nations , to stop war . I wonder . At last the Germans agreed to sign . The ceremony was set for June twenty  --  eigh th . We made arrangements to leave immediately afterward for Brest to board the George Washington . The whole household went merrily to pack  --  ing . In the midst of this cheery bustle , M. , Jusserand called . President and Mme. PoincarCt wished to give us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elys6e Palace . Again it was a case of noblesse and the train on which we fondly had hoped to get an early start for Brest was ordered for midnight . As we left the house for Versailles for the signing , the President gave me a lovely ' beaded bag of gray and blue 33 made by an old lady who lived at Versailles He had ordered it for me to match my gown . With it was a single crimson rosebud  --  the nearest he could come to the red , white and blue of our colors . Early that morning he had brought my favorite orchids , which I was wearing with a gray dress and hat . I put the red rosebud inside the little silk pocket of the bag , where it has long ago fallen into dust ; but the perfume of that hour will always be fresh in my memory , and the bag a precious sou  --  venir . I love to think of my husband as he looked that day , for already the sense of freedom from that unremitting labor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of going home made him radiate content . A Day in History The President joined the other mem  --  bers of our commission in the room from which each commission was to en  --  ter in a body . At last the doors opened and the French came first , headed by the old Tiger , Clemenceau ; then my husband , leading our commission . I felt a curious tightening of the throat as I looked at his dear figure , grown more slender in those months , but alert and alive . The other groups followed quickly . Then fell a silence , broken at length by the sound of footsteps as the German signatories were conducted to their places . They looked ill at ease , and were uniformly stolid , uninteresting-looking men . I could not help feeling , had I been sending men . I would have selected ones that would have been more impressive . They reminded me of prisoners before the bar of justice . The first to sign , their Teutonic faces changed not an iota as they approached the table . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound on air so tense that I sat with gooseflesh all over me . When the Americans were called , the voice of Mrs. House awakened my sense of reality . " Please , " she said , " just let me stand long enough to see my lamb sign . " The rest of the afternoon was de  --  voted to last-minute , going-away de  --  tails , and at eight we set out for the ElysCto Palace . I wore an unusual eve  --  ning gown by Worth Long , tightly draped skirts were in vogue , and my gown was of heavy black charmease , crossed in front from a low hip line , and wound tightly about the figure in lines ending in the hack in a fish-tail train . From the knees up it was made entirely of sequins , black to begin with , and shading to gun-metal , then to dark gray , light gray , and finally gleaming white at the bust and shoulders . With this , Worth had designed a sort of tiara of the sequins and rhinestones , which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doves of peace which had been given me by the city of Paris . I carried a huge fan of shaded gray feathers with tortoise-shell sticks . Too old for army service , Mr. Worth had opened his house as a home for those blinded in battle ; all of which was a noble and splendid thing to do . But I think he made a mistake in bringing these poor mutilated men to his place of business . He called them his " ehil  --  dren , " and when I would go to be fitted he would bring them into the room , three or four men , some pitifully dis  --  figured . and say : " My poor children , they are blind ; so you will not mind if they sit while you are being fitted , as it gives them great . happiness . " My pity was such that I could not bear to look 34 THE SATURDAY at . them . This very reaction made me realize the emotional strain Worth had been under for years ; so I could com  --  prehend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One morning I came in search of a certain shade of blue for an afternoon dress . We were in one of the private salons , with the usual attendance of five blind men , and had all sorts of blue stuffs piled around us , when a pendeuse came timidly in to ask if she could show Worth some material which a lady had selected for an evening coat and of which she was sure he would not ap  --  prove . I said : " Certainly , let her bring it . " So two others appeared , one bearing a roll of orange-colored velvet for the coat , the other a piece of char  --  treuse green for lining . Worth took only one look , then covered his face with his hands , crying in French : " Take it away ! I can not stand it ! My poor children , rejoice for once that you are blind ! I am sick and can not do any  --  thing more today ! Oh , oh , oh ! - Whereupon all the women rushed around as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poor monsieur , I will get you some brandy . " The other ran to order his car , and a third knelt before him and held his head . With many apologies to me , he was borne out in the arms of devoted employees and , after being revived , was put into a closed limousine . At the 8lys6e Palace , President and Madame Poincare met us at the door . Everyone was in holiday mood and happy . We left early , and as soon as we could change and have our evening things packed , we left for the station . As the train moved out and the lights of Pads grew dim , my husband and I still stood at the open window , each busy with his own thoughts , but united in our happiness of being to  --  gether at last . I turned and saw be was looking at me . Before I could speak , he said : " Well , little girl , it is finished , and , as no one is satisfied , it makes me hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all on the lap of the gods . " How good it was to reach Washing  --  ton and be surrounded once more by the simple dignity of the White House . Fondly I had imagined that this would mean the resumption of normal ways of life . With the peace treaty ratified . my husband had planned to return to his program of domestic legislation interrupted by the war . Alas , what a dream that was ! The Washington Conflict Already the partisans , bent on de  --  stroying the President by defeating the treaty at any cost , had drawn their lines . I shall relate little of the political part of that tragic story here , for my account is a personal one . Scholars of a new generation , men unknown to my husband and unknown to me , have written hooks on this subject in which much of the opposition to Mr. Wilson is called political and vindictive , I shall skip all I can skip and keep my story clear , lest otherwise I yield to the feel  --  ings of my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conferences with senators  --  some of them eager to help , some " irreeoncilables . " Pa  --  tiently the President clarified and ex  --  plained , pointing out that in March some of the men who now opposed the treaty had promised to vote for it it ' certain changes they suggested were made . These changes had been made . The President contended that neither he nor they had the moral right further to modify any article unless every other country should be granted the EVENING POST same privilege . That , of course , would mean chaos , complete emasculation , for each country had amendments it wished to make . Day after day , week after week , these conferences continued . Anyone who knows the heat of Washington in July and August can picture my con  --  cern at the increasing demands on my husband 's brain and body . Toward the last of August. , when there was appar  --  ently no more he could do alone to get the treaty ratified by the Senate , he said that as a last resort he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aroused public opinion would force the Senate to yield . This proposal was stoutly opposed by Doctor Grayson , who did not think the President could draw further on his strength without risking disaster . They had several talks  --  very serious talks . " Yes , " my husband said , " but I feel it is my duty : and my own health is not to be considered when the future peace and security of the world are at stake . If the treaty is not ratified by the Sen  --  ate , the war will have been fought in vain , and the world will be thrown into chaos . I promised our soldiers , when I asked them to take up arms , that it was a war to end wars ; and if I do not do all in my power to put the treaty into effect , I will be a slacker and never able to look those boys in the eye . I must go . " To this , neither Doctor Grayson nor I could find an answer . A final appeal by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special train pulled out . The tour had not progressed far when serious headaches began to afflict my husband . He paid Little attention to them , though I could see that each day each appearance was calling more and more on his depleted reserve of nervous energy . The rising tide of ap  --  proval , of course , helped him much . He felt he was winning his fight .. This gratified me , naturally , but I could see how closely Doctor Grayson watched his patient . The doctor 's disregarded warnings against attempting the tour haunted my sleep , and I do not think that I am one to borrow trouble . At Billings , Montana , occurred an incident which touched us , and which my husband related later in an address at Tacoma . I give it in his words : " A number of boys carrying flags were chasing the train as it pulled slowly out , yelling all sorts of pleasant things to their friend ' Woody . ' One young  --  ster in his enthusiasm insisted I should take his flag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to him did not have a flag and he looked a good deal dis  --  gruntled for a moment , and then he put his band in his pocket and said : ' Here , will give you a dime . ' I would like to believe that that dime has some rela  --  tion to the widow 's mite  --  others gave something ; he gave all that he had . " After my husband 's death nearly five years later , I found , in a little change purse he always carried , a dime wrapped in a piece of paper and put in a separate pocket . I am convinced that it was the dime that boy gave him on that September day in 1919 . The first tragedy to a member of our party happened at Portland , Oregon , where one of the reporters , Mr. Ben F. Allen , of the Cleveland Plain Dealer , was killed and another injured in an automobile collision . We knew nothing of the accident until we attended a luncheon given by the press . Noticing several vacant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the collision and asked to say nothing to the Presi  --  dent , as they wanted him to enjoy the February n. , 039 luncheon . The empty places were those or special friends or the victims . As soon as my husband learned what had hap  --  pened , he went to see the injured man , who , fortunately , was not seriously hurt and was able to go on with us that night on the train . His name was Small . Ha was given a drawing room on the train , and the President went every day to his car to visit him . He recovered entirely , and lived to write some very unkind things about Wood  --  row Wilson . At Seattle , the President reviewed the great Pacific fleet , The barge of Admiral Hugh Rodman was expected to be ready to convey the reviewing party to the historic battleship Oregon . By some negligence , the barge was not there . Commander Foote , personal aide to the Secretary of the Navy , promptly took over a naval launch , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Secret Service men , aides , reporters , and so on , we constituted a large party . As Com  --  mander Foote ordered the launch shoved off , the small craft heeled over until the port rail was nearly under water . Then we ran bow on into an  --  other launch . Personally I would not have excused the admiral who had en  --  dangered lives in this way , though the President did . Going to the People iConitnued from Page 341 we would head for home . We counted in vain . The morning was taken from us by visitors before we knew it . But , I stubbornly told myself , the President would sleep in the afternoon , and then , in the cool of the evening , we would slip out and drive alone , I have related before how my husband could sleep almost any time he got the chance , and how that sleep would relax him and dissipate the poisons of fatigue . Mrs. Peck , whom my husband had known in Bermuda many years before , was to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done to make an intrigue of that friendship , I was glad to receive her and show my disdain for such slander . She came  --  a faded , sweet-looking woman who was absorbed in an only son . She told many stories of her strug  --  gle to maintain herself and help him get . his start . So wrapped up was she in her own problems that I am sure she forgot how fast the time was flying , and had I not coveted every moment of it I would have enjoyed her . Pres  --  ently some men came for an official conference . When my husband left the room to meet them , Mrs. Peck said she would wait until he was through . Poor woman , weighed down with her own problems , of course , she did not understand . Darkness had fallen when she finally rose to go . At . Salt Lake City the address was to be made in the Mormon Temple at eight o'clock in the evening . Before six Mr. Tumulty came in to say that the place was packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had locked the doors to prevent a stampede . From our windows at the hotel we could see what looked to be thousands and thou  --  sands of people still gathering . The Salt Lake Meeting The fetid air we encountered on en  --  tering that great building was unlike anything I have ever experienced . Imagine fifteen thousand human be  --  ings in hot weather shut up tightly with no ventilation for more than two hours . I felt sick and blind . We were pushed through at last to the rostrum and seated on the long seats where the Apostles , I think they are called , sit during the Mormon service . To this day I can not conceive how the Presi  --  dent spoke under such conditions . I should have fainted dead away but for the merci  --  ful fact that Sei  --  grid , my maid . bad carried a bot  --  tle of smelling salts . It seemed an intervention of providence that I had taken Seigrid , for I had never done so before . But that day she told me she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible for her to go just once . I borrowed a large fresh hand  --  kerchief from one of the Secret Serv  --  ice men , soaked it in the lavender salts and had it taken to the Presi  --  dent . At last the oration made by the head of the Mormon Church , Mr. Grant , introduc  --  ing the President , was over , and Mr. Wilson was on his feet waiting for the applause to cease before he began his speech . With conditions so unfavorable , I was scarcely the one to judge of the merit of the speech itself . I quote , therefore , from the Salt Lake Tribune : " The President 's sincerity , the care with which he weighed his words , and the ease of his address made his mes  --  sage simple and at the same time tre  --  mendously effective . " When it was over and we were back in the hotel , I found that even his coat was soaked through with perspiration . We got him into dry things as quickly as possible , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes . This exhausting state continued into the night , and the next day , at Chey  --  enne , found him too weary to pretend he was not . ill . He spoke there in the afternoon and we started for Denver , arriving at 10:30 P.M. How I longed to cry out . for a few days of rest . But when I suggested it , he said : " No , I have caught the imagination of the people . They are eager to hear what the League stands for , and I should fad in my duty if I disappointed them . " So downcast was I that he tried to cheer me up : " This will soon be over , and when we get back to Washington I promise you I will take a holiday . " Then he added : " Is Small all right ? Is everything being done for him ? " Tip early after a poor night 's rest , my husband 's headache never leaving him .

" This will have to be a short speech , " my husband said as he took the stand , and then , nodding to the men in the press box who had followed him more than 9000 miles and listened to thirty-nine of his speeches already : " Are n't you fellows getting pretty sick of this ? " Strangely , the speech that followed was one of the longest , one of the most vigorous and touching he made on the tour , and again I do not venture this opinion without consulting the impres  --  sions of more detached hearers . Warm  --  ing to his subject , the President 's weariness seemed to leave him . New and undiscovered reservoirs of strength seemed to reinforce his efforts . ' rears were on my cheeks , and not mine alone , when he launched into this conclusion : " Mothers who have lost sons in France have come to me , and taking my hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have added : ' God bless you , Mr. President . ' Why , my fellow citizens , should they pray God to bless me ? I ordered their sons over  --  seas . I Consented to their sons being put in the most difficult parts of the battle line , where death was certain . Why should they weep upon my hand and call down the blessings of God upon me ? Because they believe that their boys died for something that vastly transcends any of the immedi  --  ate and palpable objects of the war . " Woodrow Wilson 's Valedictory He recalled Decoration Day at Su  --  resnes Cemetery . " I wish some of the men who are now opposing the settle  --  ment for which those men died could visit such a spot . as that . I wish they could feel the moral obligation that rests upon us not to go back on those boys , but to see this thing through to the end and make good their redemp  --  tion of the world . " Such was Woodrow Wilson 's vale  --  dictory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned  --  if , indeed , it had ever gone . On the train that evening Doctor Grayson thought perhaps some mild exercise in the fresh Colorado air would help . After consulting the engi  --  neer , it was arranged to stop the train for half an hour and let us go for a walk . This we did , and came back much refreshed . Dinner was a cheerful one , for my husband really ate some  --  thing and said his head was easier than it had been for days . Doctor Grayson and Mr. Tumulty dined with us , and we all decided to turn in early . My maid came to brush my hair and give me a massage . We kept very quiet , as my room was next to my hus band 's , and / thought he was asleep . About 11:30 I was surprised , therefore , when he knocked at the intervening door and asked , if I was through , would I come to him , as he was very sick . I found him sitting on the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chair in front of him . Ho said he had tried to sleep , but the pain had grown unbearable and he thought I had bet ter call Doctor Grayson . I sent Seigrid to the doc  --  tor 's room . He was not there , and it seemed to me hours before he could be lo  --  cated on the train . Of course it was only minutes , but I realized we were facing something terrible . That night was the longest and most heartbreak  --  ing of my life . Nothing the doc  --  tor could do gave relief . Finally the President got up and dressed . He said he could not stay in that tiny room ; he must move about . He went to the im  --  provised study , ( Continued an Page 38 ) ( Continued tram Page 36 ) where we took pillows to try to make him comfortable , but he could not stay quiet . The doctor and I kept the vigil while the train dashed on and on through darkness . About five in the morning a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stiff seat , my husband fell asleep . I motioned to the doctor to go on to bed , and I sat opposite , scarcely breathing lest I wake him . He slept quietly , and how I prayed that when he woke all would be well . Alas ! I knew that it could not be . The dear face opposite me was drawn and lined ; and as I sat there watching the dawn break slowly , I felt that life would never be the same ; that something had broken inside me , and from that hour on I would have to wear a mask , not only to the public but to the one I loved best in the world ; for he must never know how ill he was , and I must . carry on . He woke about . seven and said he must shave and get ready , as we were to reach Wichita , Kansas , very soon . I knew he could not speak there . After seeing him to his room , Doctor Grayson , Mr. Tumulty and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the midst of our talk , the President appeared , freshly dressed , shaven , and looking , oh , so piteously ill . When we suggested that he cancel the rest of the trip and take a vacation , he said no . We urged it , and he still said no . Doctor Grayson said any other course might bring disastrous , even fatal , consequences . " No , no , no . I must keep on . " In the end it re  --  mained for me to " hold the mirror up to nature " and show him that the fight was over . In justice to his cause , he must stop for a while . I think it was about the hardest task that has fallen to my lot . At last , though , it was done . He accepted the decree of Fate as gallantly as he had fought the fight , All this he understood and witnessed in the space of a minute , as the column moved before his dooryard . And now came the scoutmaster , beaming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Pullitt was also principal of the high school ; Dewey thought vaguely of Mr. Pullitt 's schoolteaching as a kind of hobby , practiced occasionally when the more important Boy Scout work was n't demanding his attention . Dewey looked up into the pink , shin  --  ing face of Scoutmaster Pullitt . Scout  --  master Pullitt sang to him genially , sang with authentic notes , " Good morning , Dewey ! How are you ? " The boy felt a fire inside his chest ; his dead knees were turned to clay , but somehow he made them move . He could not look up again . He heard the gate slam ; then he was trotting in road  --  side grass beside the scoutmaster . The big man stopped , and lifted a finger , and smiled again . Dewey skidded to a halt beside him . " Yes , Dewey ? " The Boy Scouts went on ; some of them were looking hack . Green wil  --  lows of the riverside and the darker green of Hogsbeek lured beyond them . " What is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I was just a-wondering ? " Behind him , the house door slammed . Without turning , Dewey ' knew who stood upon the porch . It was as if he had eyes at the back of his head ; andbut only he and his God knew the crucifixion that began that moment  --  to stretch into interminable years , dur  --  ing which the seal he put on his lips , never to repine or voice a syllable of self-pity or regret , remained unbroken . Not until the train was slowing down For Wichita did the President come to realize the truth . The program called for a stop on the outskirts of the city , where the official party was to transfer to automobiles . The newspapermen and other members of the train 's com  --  pany were getting in their ears , the re  --  ception committee was waiting , when Mr. Tumulty went out and said that . the President could not make an ad  --  dress . What a transformation took place . Wires clicked train orders and the re  --  porters fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill and that Doctor Grayson had ordered him to Washington for complete rest . Tracks were cleared , and with a pilot engine running ahead of us , we left Wichita at eleven in the morning , September 26 , 1919 , for Washington , seventeen hundred miles away . People gathered at every station to see the train roar through . At the necessary stops they crowded around so much that we pulled the shades . The car seemed like a funeral cortege . My husband and I sat in the office compartment , I trying to go on as though the structure of our life did not lie in ruin around us . I took some knitting and tried to work , and to divert my husband with small talk . But the air was so heavy with unspoken agony that all seemed a travesty . The hours dragged on ; night came ; brought DO rest ; another day ; another bad night  --  and another dawn found me staring into the future , wide-eyed , wondering . Editor 's Note  --  This is the eighth of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear next week those eyes were peering from out the tight hair which curled along his neck , to see his mother standing on the porch , tall and thin and bony in her clean patched apron . She called to him . It was as if he saw her mouth open before he beard the cry . " Dewey ! Come here , sonny boy ! " The troop was gone far ahead  --  far toward the railroad tracks and green river willows . Scoutmaster Pullitt looked rather puzzled as Dewey raised his face and mumbled rapidly , " Mr. Pullitt , I just wondered if you wanted to have me fetch any vegetables this morning ? " The scoutmaster slapped Dewey 's shoulder and laughed , and the boy stood staring after him as he loped away . The scoutmaster sang out , " Of course I do ! Do n't Forget to stop at my house with some of those Tice fresh radishes I see over by the pump ! " " Yes , sir , " said Dewey , and went back into the yard . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basket , when Muddy came to the door and stood looking at him soberly .
