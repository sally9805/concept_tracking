Economic Dissertation <P> Washington was still waiting last week for Franklin Roosevelt to say or do something about Sit-Down . The President sat down and did nothing , and while he did it the situation worked out much to his advantage . New Dealers in Senate and House took the initiative without involving him , thereby appeasing those who wanted action , while the President continued to enjoy the love of Labor to whom silence meant consent ( see p. 17 ) . <P> But if he held his peace on one topic , he spoke out boldly on another of national concern : the upward spiral of commodity prices . He was visited by Fiorello LaGuardia of New York City , spokesman for other U. S. mayors , who protested a new PWA rule which requires all of the Federal grants for Public Works projects to be spent on relief labor . This was followed by a visit from a delegation of the House of Representatives who wanted to appropriate $300,000,000 more for PWA , which now has only $155,000,000 left to spend . To both , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his press conference next day he delivered what he called an economic dissertation to explain why he was in favor of tapering off PWA activities : <P> In the early stages of recovery the heavy industries such as steel lagged behind . So it was advisable to prime the pump by public works . Now . he said , the situation was reversed . The durable goods industries were making more rapid progress than the consumer goods industries . The prices of their products were going up accordingly . For example , some mines can produce copper at 5 , or 6 a Ib , but copper was selling at 17 . And the price of steel was up $6 a ton . These prices , he intimated were too high , much more than covered increased labor costs , meant that a larger share of the national income was going into building factories and machines , a smaller share into wages and the purchase of food &; clothing . According to one economic theory , this condition tends to cause depressions . To counteract this tendency the Federal Government would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn to earth dams , channel dredging and other projects where most of its money would go into wages that would be spent for consumer goods . <P> To speculators this preachment against spiraling prices was a shock that gave the stockmarket a fit of the jitters . But the President 's statement that there has been an undue rise of metal prices and more rapid recovery in heavy industry than in other industry , was questioned by economists ( see p. 77 ) . Regardless of its accuracy , however , the President 's dissertation marked a milestone in New Deal policy : pump-priming is at an end . So far as Franklin Roosevelt is concerned , the business of getting out of the last Depression is now subordinate to the business of avoiding the next .
