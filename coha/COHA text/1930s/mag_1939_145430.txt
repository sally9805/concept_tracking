Compared with the tough kids of contemporary fiction , Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer were cherubs . But the contrast is more apparent than real ; portrayed with James Farrell 's pimpled candor , Huck Finn would undoubtedly be just as taboo for adolescent libraries as Studs Lonigan . Well aware of this fact are grownups who grew up in Midwest small towns . But few of them have admitted as much in print . <P> Inn of That Journey ( Caxton , $2.50 ) , the first novel of a 36-year-old Ohioan named Emerson Price , is a sample of such realism-a transcript of back-alley life , swimming-hole conversation , and those other phases of their private lives which sons conceal from their parents . <P> Soap Dodger Pendleton , leader of the Scatterfield gang , was the junkman 's son , a blond , dirty , resourceful brat who spat tobacco juice in the ink wells . He devised ingenious persecutions for teachers ' pets and snitches and for most grownups except old German Lew , who gave the gang beer , and old Charlie Heston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , muddy Scatterfield , which he called the Roman Empire . <P> To the preacher who asked him " What might your name be , little man ? " Soap Dodger answered , " It might be Jesus Christ , but it hai n't . " He never whimpered , not even when his old man laid him cold , and he was first of the gang to find out about sex at first hand . Such accomplishments and wisdom ranked high with his followers : Wickie Winters , scabby-faced , half-dressed , half-wit son of a washerwoman ; Cockie Werner , whose only talent was catching frogs ; Nutsie Doane , also ordinary , except for a crooked arm , the result of having a broken arm re-broken by his drunken old man . <P> Among this gang Mark Cullen was handicapped by his size and social position . He was a skinny , frail moppet , whose father was rural superintendent of schools . But he had plenty of nerve , and on Hallowe'en night ( one of the funniest as well as the least printable episodes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark was as tough as the rest . <P> Although Inn of That Journey is far more candidly documented than Huckleberry Finn , it lacks something else for which its candor does not compensate : the literary verve of Mark Twain.
