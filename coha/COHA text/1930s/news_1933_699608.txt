txt That Hitler means to sacrifice the export industry to agriculture and intends at all costs to raise the prices of farm products with the hope that improvement of home demand will make up for loss of foreign markets has been revealed by numerous declarations made by his colleagues in the ministry . A beginning in this direction has been made by modification of commercial treaties with France and Sweden and increase of duties on meat , fish , eggs and lard ( which comes partly from America ) , while a proposal to compel industrial utilization of German agricultural products is under discussion . Loss of export trade due to reprisals abroad and increased cost of production is believed inevitable , since the cost of living will rise and therewith the scale of industrial wages as a result of the new protection . But in 1932 total net imports of foodstuffs amounted to rm. 1.300 , - 000,000 and total exports of manufactures to rm. 4.500.000.000. and to obtain the necessary raw materials such as copper and cotton , no less than to maintain interest payments on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exports . Thus the cost of the remedy for agriculture may prove exceedingly dear , and in some quarters it is doubted whether Hitler and his ministers will carry out thpir promises . Much has already been done to relieve agriculture , especially as regards its indebtedness . With few excerptions all maturities have been subject to postponement since December , 1931 , including mortgages amounting to approximately rm. 8.000,000,000 . ' Over aiyear ago interest rates on all internal mortgages were reduced to 6% , from 8%. on the average and in September , last , the rate on farm mortgages was brought down to 4% until September , 1934 , farmers being liable to payment of 2% interest in arrears only after maturity of the debt . Since the Reich undertook to refinance the arrears of interest in the case of mortgage banks , interest rate on mortgage bonds was not lowered at that time . Total interest cue on farm mortgages amounts today to only rm. 500.000.000 annually , against double that sum two years ago . In addition farmers east of the Elbe River are assisted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for creditors who voluntarily or involuntarily compound with their debtors . Though the Osthilf. as it is called . has not yet made many such arrangements , it has proved useful because once a farmer appeals to it  --  and most of the big eastern landlords have done so  --  he is immune from action by his creditors until its decision is rendered . Finally by raising of tariff duties and other measures . the decline in grain prices has been kept down to Production of wheat increased 20% in the past three years , however .
