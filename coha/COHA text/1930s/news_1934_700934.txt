txt There is nothing new about the " economy of abundance " preached by Stuart Chase , economist , said Lewis W. Douglas , former Director of the Budget , in a rebuttal to Mr. Chase 's address before the Economic Club of New York . It has been preached time after time , and yet , just as frequently , it has been proved to be wrong , Mr. Douglas asserted . Moreover , said Mr. Douglas , history repeatedly has answered the question put by Mr. Chase : If the federal budget is balanced what assurance is there that there will be a revival of capital goods industries ? Each time , declared Mr. Douglas , it has been answered In only one way : capital has sought investment , people have gone back to work and rifts in the clouds of depression always have appeared . Even though the United States had unlimited borrowing capacity  --  which it has not  --  it would be inadvisable to continue tremendous governmental spending as an artificial attempt to end the depression , Mr. Douglas said . How far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually not by the given nation 's per capita debt , but by what evidence there is of a determination to stop spending , Mr. Douglas continued . As for the United States , its credit already has been seriously impaired ; savings are no longer absorbing government securities , and the government is resorting to the expedient of getting a bookkeeping credit on the books of banks , which . in effect , is equivalent to starting up the printing presses , declared the former budget director . The main portions of Mr. Douglas ' reply to the Chase address follow : " I do n't think the situation today is any different from the situation in 1819 . The machine was even then beginning to replace human labor , just as a certain type of energy now is beginning to replace an older type of energy . ? ? ? Without Capital , Inventions Ca n't Produce " I think , Mr. Chase referred to the many " inventions . If this be correct , then all the greater the requirement capital investment , to put those inventions into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be placed in a position of production ! " He refers to the many who are engaged in distributing the goods  --  the greater volume of goods  --  which have been produced as a result of the machine and of energy . All the more reason then for the continued further development of more goods and the installation of more inventions so that employment is thereby in-creased ! " But Mr. Chase says the cost of living has n't fallen as a result of the improved technical methods . Although I ca n't support the statement with any evidence at hand I think that a careful analysis of the trend of the cost of living will demonstarte that between 1900 and 1930 it was falling . " Mr. Chase says that technological unemployment is one of our current diseases . Those who believe in this refer to a machine or the ' Machine ' as that which produces more goods with less man-power . Certainly there are many such ' machines which do produce more goods with less man-power than a somewhat more obsolete method produced five , six or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men in the production of those machines , and the men employed in the materials that go into those machines ? ? ? " Mr. Chase says foreign trade is no longer possible  --  with these tariffs that have been erected . As one reviews the history of the last 14 year . with the exception of the United States , what is the fundamental reason for the erection of tariffs ? In large measure , to ' protect currencies ' ? ? " There is nothing new about the ' economy of abundance ' , and it has been preached time after time , and yet , just as frequently , it has been demonstrated to be wrong ! The British and German Public Debts " Now , Mr. Chase asks three questions : " One . ' How long can the government continue to rush into the gap before reaching the red light signal of wild inflation ? ' He says that our per-capita debt can go up as high as the per-capita debt of Great Britain . I wonder if it 's not almost there now ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fiscal year , about S32,000.000.000 , the schools , etc .. you have an ? approximate public debt of $55.000,000.000 . It I may he a little more or less . The public debt of Great Britain , as I understand it , is somewhere in the vicinity of 335,000.000.000 , but our population is greater than Great Britain 's ( something , like twice as great ) , so we could , on that basis , suport a debt of somewhere around 56,5.000,000. - 000 so , wc are therefore approaching the limit ? but that is not so much the question . For example , Germany , as I understand the situation , had little public debt at the expiration of the war ; yet the mark , inside of four years , became worthless . The point is , when is there going to be any evidence of a determination ' to stop spending ? That is the important consideration in testing or applying a test of how , far a government can spend . " But more than that : it seems to me. as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' States government already been seriously im-1 paired  --  and why ? Because its obligations arc not being absorbed by savings Savings are no longer absorbing government securities , and the government is resorting to the second process : that of getting a bookkeeping credit on the books of a bank . Thus , it is just as effectually ' printed money ' as though the government had started the printing presses in Washington . " But , Mr. Chase asks , can the budget be balanced in 1936 without making those now the beneficiaries of the government expenditures completely destitute ? In the program which I advocate , you will find a federal appropriation $1.250.000,000 , which is substantially more than the total amount expended for relief during the , year 1933 . Is that reducing the unemployed to i a condition of destitution ? But , if the states and municipalities contribute as they did , and no more , then the total amount , exclusive of private charities , will approximate $2.000.000 , -1 000 ! And that is the figure Mr. Chase assumes , to be necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Budget " The program for balnacing the budget in 1936 is not a difficult one  --  it simply involves no additional appropriation for public works , and the reorganization of the re-finance corporations and the like into purely liquidating organizations . " But , Mr. Chase asks , if the budget is balanced , what assurance is there that there will be a revival of capital goods industries ? That is the same/ question that has been asked in previous depressions . ? ? ? Each time , the question has been answered in only one way . Capital has sought investment  --  people have gone back to work , and rifts in the clouds of depression have always appeared . That is the historical argument , and I see no reason for believing that , experience having demonstrated these arguments to be wrong , we should now accept them as being true . " Mr. Chase refers to public works  --  he refers to the inadequacy of the amount I estimated could be spent in the government taking over all means of production , and I remember in 1033 there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two billions , three billions , and five billions during the fiscal year of 1934 , and who got three billions to spend ? but how much was expended ? About $700,000 , - 000 as a maximum . It takes time , gentlemen , to spend public money on public works . They can get it , but they ca n't spend it in a year or two years or three years . But , as I have pointed out before , the experience of France and England and even of our own country with public works demonstrated that they are absolutely futile expedients to relieve unemployment . You can spend $2,500,000,000 , and the average employment given wo n't exceed 700.000 people . But When a Government Spend ' " But , it is said , there is no difference who spends it . There Is a difference ! When a private individual spends and spends , he goes bankrupt , and he is the only one hurt , and the few who work for him -- but when a government continues to spend both the issuing power as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it destroys the currency. ? ? ? " Mr. Chase refers to the printing of non-interest bearing notes , and he says that we are going through a change anyway , and it might be as well to change some of our theories about money . That sounds to me strangely like the National Assembly in France in 1789 , in a speech by Mr. Montrou . He , like every supporter of irredeemable paper money , seemed to think that the laws of nature had changed . He said that paper money under a despotism is dangerous , but in a national constitutional government , which takes care of the issuance of notes , etc. , the danger no longer exists . There were changes then ? important changes ? and they wound up with a complete destruction of the currency , and with impoverished people in the Place de la . Concorde , and the very flrat act of Napoleon was to revert to specie payments ! " Oh , gentlemen , there is nothing more wicked , more cruel , more devastating , that a government can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involuntarily destroy its currency ! "
