Instead of giving Adolf Hitler the masculine Nazi salute with outstretched arm , German women began last week by official instruction to give the Fhrer a new " feminine salute ' ' which for months has grown popular in Nazi circles . Henceforth , any American woman , wishing to do as the Romans do while visiting in the Rome of Naziism will , on sight of the Fhrer , simultaneously bend her right elbow and raise her arm horizontally to shoulder level . Continuing to hold her arm thus , she will modestly bow her head in salute . <P> Ladies of the highest German aristocracy thus saluted the Fhrer officially for the first time last week at his banquet for the Regent of Hungary .
