Paleontologists could hardly have devised a better specimen trap than one which existed perhaps a million years ago near what is now Rancho La Brea in Los Angeles , Calif . Liquid asphalt oozing up from the earth formed a sticky surface pool , covered by a few inches of water . Because this water was unpleasant to the taste , animals preferred to drink from waterholes or streams fed by melting mountain snow . But the Pleistocene climate was sometimes dry and water was scarce . Then big herbivores such as Asiatic camels , mammoths , bison and ground sloth ventured into the asphalt to slake their thirst , became hopelessly stuck . Their struggles attracted sabre-tooth tigers , lions , wolves and coyotes which in turn were trapped in the tar . Swooping to feast on these carcasses came eagles and huge vultures which sometimes got caught while fighting among themselves . Few years ago the bones of all these creatures began finding their way into museums . <P> Spanish settlers soon discovered that the pool was a menace to livestock . Riders watched constantly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasso . Even today careless jackrabbits get entangled as if on a huge flypaper . <P> Some 30 years ago contractors began to dig up the La Brea asphalt for road paving , found it too full of bones to be used . An alert University of California scientist noticed that the discolored skeletons were mostly of extinct creatures . Gradually a mass of fossils found its way into the museums of the U. S. and the world . Never before had paleontologists seen an entire system of life so well preserved in a single locality . <P> Chicago 's Field Museum of Natural History got enough material to reconstruct a ground sloth , a sabre-tooth tiger , a primitive horse , an extinct bison . Last week these skeletons were put on view in a group depicting the recurring drama of the Ice Age . The sloth , mired , is being attacked by the tiger , which itself is caught by one hind foot . The bison sniffs dubiously at the pool 's edge . Scenting danger , the horse wheels away as if to escape .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
