In 1862 a hard-fisted Vermont pioneer named Albert Arnold Sprague bumped out to Chicago in a covered wagon and went into the grocery trade . With his brother and another Vermonter , Ezra J. Warner , he formed the wholesale house of Sprague , Warner &; Co. , which grew with lusty young Chicago . Sprague Warner was a pioneer in the packaging of food , and its Richelieu brands became more famous than the hotel for which they were named. * By the time the second Ezra J. Warner died in 1933 , Sprague Warner was a far-flung manufacturing and wholesale house , as prestigious as Manhattan 's Charles &; Co. or Boston 's S. S. Pierce , and a good deal bigger than either . <P> Meanwhile , two smart Philadelphia Jewish boys named Harry and Maxwell Kunin had rolled out to Chicago in a Pullman and gone into the grocery trade . With their father they opened a small store , branched into manufacturing and wholesaling , did a $250,000 gross business in 1919 , their first year . Paying workers on a Bedaux-like bonus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and selling them cheaply , Samuel Kunin &; Sons , Inc. grew fast . Last year they grossed nearly $5,000,000-a third as much as lumbering old Sprague Warner , which was having tough going with its 11,000 items ( including 84 brands of coffee ) , its 550,000-square-foot Chicago plant , its warehouses in 18 cities . <P> Harry Kunin wears a gardenia , its stem in a phial of water . Daily he commutes between Chicago and suburban Highland Park , where he has a landscaped " farm " complete with boat landing but no boat ( " You 've never seen anything like it outside of the movies , " says Brother Max ) . One day last year Harry Kunin found himself sitting on the train next to chubby-faced young Thomas Charles Dennehy Jr. , who had married Founder Warner 's granddaughter and got to be Sprague Warner 's executive vice president . Tom Dennehy dresses like a farmer , lives in swank Lake Forest ; farming and sailing are his hobbies . <P> Groceryman Kunin jokingly proposed a merger : " With your brand names and reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Groceryman Dennehy laughed it off . But next time the two met on the train they joked some more about a merger . <P> Last week the merger was a reality . Engineered by clever Tom Dennehy , who became president of the new Sprague Warner , it gave both companies what they most needed . Harry and Maxwell Kunin ( who became secretary-treasurer and vice president ) got bigger manufacturing and distributing facilities , the prestige of Sprague Warner 's name . Sprague Warner got the Kunins . Nobody put up any money . To reports that he had bought out Sprague Warner , Harry Kunin replied : " Where the hell would I lay my hands on $3,000,000 ? " <P> <P> *The Richelieu 's owner , a Colonel Bemus , used to trot around to Sprague Warner 's to sample before buying . Anything the sniffish colonel approved was dubbed " Richelieu " as a mark of distinction .
