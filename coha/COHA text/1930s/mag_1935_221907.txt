Article XVI of the League Covenant , officially in force last week , prohibits " all intercourse between nationals ' ' of a Covenant-breaking State and other League States . Since the League has pronounced Italy a Covenant-breaking State , Geneva correspondents were on watch last week to see whether intercourse would be had by the Italian Chief Delegate Baron Pompeo Aloisi . Zealots said it would be a " League crime " if French Premier Pierre Laval or British Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare had dealings of any sort with the Fascist Baron or even spoke to him . <P> In Paris , as Premier Laval boarded a wagon-lit for Geneva , he snapped positively , " Peace will be made ! It will be made despite malevolent indiscretion , spiteful controversies and misleading reports . " <P> In London the departure of Sir Samuel Hoare was pungent with measured disdain . As only a born Englishman can , Sir Samuel disdained Welsh David Lloyd George and everyone else who has suggested that a deal is in course of being consummated by Italian and French " diplomats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seeds of suspicion , " said the Foreign Minister . " They are playing the game of creating mysteries where mysteries do not exist . " <P> Arriving at Geneva , Sir Samuel at once invited Baron Pompeo Aloisi to his hotel . Next day Captain Eden sat in " Flying Sam 's " hotel bedroom conference with the Fascist Baron , who in turn was twice closeted with Premier Laval . <P> " The Deal , " Revealed little by little in Geneva leaks last week was the current status of " The Deal " which Italians and French statesmen have been in course of making with the British ( TIME , Oct. 14 ) . In Paris its technical and colonial aspects have now been negotiated outside the fevered atmosphere of Britain 's General Election by Mr. Maurice Peterson , the quietly efficient British Foreign Office civil servant charged with Ethiopian affairs . Mr. Peterson and his French counterpart , Count Rene de Saint-Quentin , placed at the disposal of Sir Samuel , Premier Laval and Baron Aloisi last week the negotiated basis . Next logical step was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a respectable League atmosphere , and for this purpose the Great Powers turned to " Dear Little Belgium . " Hot from Brussels to Geneva went Belgian Premier Professor Paul van Zeeland . Up he popped before the League 's Sanctions Committee of 52 states and asked that Britain and France receive an unlimited " mandate to seek the elements of a solution . " An interjection by Poland that so momentous a decision would have to come before the League Council prevented the Committee from adopting it as a formal motion , but without a vote it was adopted anyway when the Portuguese chairman of the Committee intoned : " The members of the League assembled in this Committee have given it their full approval .
