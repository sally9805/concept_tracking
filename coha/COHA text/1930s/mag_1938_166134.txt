Only antelope in the world are found in Asia and Africa . But the fleet-footed North American pronghorns , tawny , wide-eyed little animals about the size of a calf , were called antelope on sight by the Adam-pioneers . Before those pioneers plowed under the grass of the Great Plains , ' ' antelope " herds roamed from Texas to Canada , from the Mississippi to the Cascades . Because of unrestricted killing , by 1911 the pronghorns , like the buffalo , were threatened with extinction . But pronghorn herds , now well protected , have staged a reproductive comeback : in Oregon alone , according to the State Game Commission , they have increased tenfold. * <P> The pronghorn 's amazing recovery is due mostly to State laws forbidding antelope hunting and to the creation by States and by the Federal Government of antelope refuges and ranges . Most important single refuge , because it contains the pronghorns ' fawning grounds , is the region around Oregon 's Hart Mountain . There mounted patrolmen travel over 276,000 acres of sagebrush inspecting the range , watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year Oregon 's pronghorn herd had risen from the 1911 figure of 2,000 to almost 20,000 . Last week the State Game Commission opened a five-day pronghorn hunting season outside its refuge , the first since 1911 , limiting hunters to one horned animal of either sex but permitting the use of telescope sights on guns . Reason : too plentiful to please farmers , too tame for their own good , many pronghorns have broken bounds , roam nearby ranches at night to steal food . <P> <P> * Antelope usually have one or two fawns a year .
