Solomon Guggenheim has always been interested in education . He was , for example , treasurer of the Public Schools Athletic League of New York for many years and is still a patron of the Brightside Day Nursery . These activities are pie , however , to the educational job Solomon Guggenheim undertook two years ago at the age of 76 . " I desire to encourage the development of the esthetic sense of our people , " said old Mr. Guggenheim , and plunked down something like $3,000,000 to endow a foundation for " nonobjective " art ( TIME , July 12 , 1937 ) . <P> " Nonobjective " art is the purist 's name for abstract art in which no trace of actuality remains . A cubist breakdown of the statutory cubist wine bottle and guitar would not qualify . Solomon Guggenheim had grown grey in philanthropy and the copper business before he fell for his first nonobjective painting about eleven years ago . Since then he has accumulated 726 of them , the world 's biggest private collection . His guide and friend in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Baroness Hilla Rebay von Ehrenwiesen . <P> In Manhattan last week the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation emerged from abstraction to reality in the shape of an elegant , three-story , glassy gallery on East 54th Street . Through every spacious room amplifiers sent the moping or striding music of Bach ; the walls were pure white and velvety grey , and on them were displayed 415 items from the Guggenheim collection . Predominant types : the whorls , jackstraws and disembodied eyelashes of Russian Vasily Kandinsky ; the massive , machinelike color patterns of French Fernand Lger ; the planetary balls and bubbles , interlocking triangles and color spots of German Rudolf Bauer . It was the biggest , smartest , brightest , most expensive exhibition of abstract painting Manhattan had ever seen . <P> Manhattanites were interested but not immediately ecstatic . Though the exhibition was boldly billed " Art of Tomorrow " to outbid the Museum of Modern Art 's " Art in Our Time , " a few critics meanly suggested that it was actually art of the past . Curator Hilla Rebay , her blue eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one transcendental line : <P> " Only since people learned to hear even subtle variations in the apparent repetition of jazz the great fugues of Bach became approachable to the masses . " <P> " With architects , engineers and designers using motifs from nonobjective paintings . . . the layman is gradually getting acquainted with their beauty . . . . " <P> " Top of culture is where art is . Art and culture like sun can not be old-fashioned or modern . . . . " <P>
