Oh , somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright ; <P> The band is playing somewhere , and somewhere hearts are light , <P> And somewhere men are laughing , and somewhere children shout ; <P> But there is no joy in Mudville-mighty Casey has struck out . <P> " Who is Casey ? " wasp-waisted little wives whispered into their husbands ' sideburns as young De Wolf Hopper recited the last stanza of a poem called Casey at the Bat in Wallack 's Theatre on Broadway one summer night in 1888 . It was a gala baseball night in honor of the visiting Chicago White Stockings and the management had clipped the tragi-comic verses out of the San Francisco Examiner for young Hopper to deliver as an added fillip between the acts of the operetta , Prince Methusalem . <P> Not only wives but even the most seasoned baseballers in the audience wondered who Casey was . Harvardman ( 1885 ) Ernest L. Thayer , who had written the poem for the paper his friend Willie Hearst had recently acquired , declared that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had to invent not one but many .

Almost every community had its Casey and announced it in the public prints . <P> De Wolf Hopper died three years ago and it was about that time that a wizened little septuagenarian from Silver Springs , Md. walked into a Washington newspaper office and presented himself as the original Casey .

It was the last of the ninth and New York was leading 4-to-3 . Two men were out and there were runners on second and third . A week before I 'd busted up a game with a lucky homer and folks thought I could repeat . . . . " <P> Baseball bigwigs , eager to round up all forgotten heroes for next year 's centennial , decided that Dan Casey had valid claim to baseball immortality . This spring Oldster Casey , now 76 , was rewarded with a lifetime pass to all ball parks , was introduced to the U. S. public on a radio program . Last week , the Baltimore Orioles , whose feats have been almost as integral a part of baseball folklore as Casey 's , invited the latest Maryland celebrity to stage a revival of Casey-at-the-bat as a prologue to a night game with the Jersey City Giants . It rained on " Casey Night . " Dan Casey , neatly garbed in a business suit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gnarled fingers round a bat for the first time in 40 years . From 2,000 throats or more there rose a lusty yell as Oriole Coach Rogers Hornsby , recent manager of the St. Louis Browns , wound up for the special strikeout.
