A quick way for newspaper readers to follow the fortunes of Spain 's war is to note on which side correspondents are allowed near the front , for neither Rightists nor Leftists like to let the press come near when they are losing . But last week 's end Rightist chances in the Battle of Teruel were bright enough for them to allow five carloads of correspondents to approach the firing line . <P> As the press cars reached the little village of Caude , five miles northwest of Teruel , they stopped for one which had lagged behind . Cigarets were lit . From one of the cars a young man ran forward to give his friends in a car ahead a bar of chocolate . <P> As he reached the car and passed the chocolate to the man in the driver 's seat a 75 mm. shrapnel shell burst right beside him with a deafening roar . A steel splinter drove through ' his back , killing him instantly . The man beside him crumpled up mortally wounded . Of the two men in the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was barely hurt . Before the occupants of the other cars could reach their friends , a second shell , which did little damage , threw them flat on their faces . <P> Well known to hundreds of newspapermen were all the members of that party . Bradish Johnson , the dead chocolate-passer , was a 26-year-old Manhattan socialite who had spent much of his life in Paris , was taking photographs and sending articles from Spain to Newsweek and The Spur . The other fatality was Ernest Richard Sheepshanks of the British Reuters News Service . A superior young British bachelor , he was once captain of the Eton cricket eleven , followed the armies of Haile Selassie in Ethiopia , and won the awed admiration of Italian aviators in Salamanca by dressing for the war in a shepherd 's plaid shooting jacket and ponderous suede shoes . <P> Another veteran of the Ethiopian campaign but on the Italian side was the third casualty , hulking , grey-haired Edward J. Neil , 37 , whose boast it was that neither he nor his father had ever worked for anyone but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he won a medal and the title Commendatore from Marshal Badoglio in Ethiopia , went on night raids with Arab sharpshooters in Palestine , reported King George 's Coronation , and scooped the world on the Rightist capture of Bilbao by filing his story under fire . <P> Hustled to a base hospital at Santa Eulalia and then to Saragossa beside his wounded friends , it was found that Correspondent Neil , who nearly died of a chest hemorrhage in Ethiopia was suffering from 34 shrapnel wounds . A Catholic priest gave his blood for a transfusion during the night and none other than El Caudillo Franco took time off from the greatest battle of his life to telephone about his condition . But gangrene had set in . Not realizing the seriousness of his wounds , worrying about his typewriter and still hoping for a glass of beer on the morrow , Eddie Neil died .
