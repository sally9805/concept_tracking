In any list of Franklin Roosevelt 's noteworthy qualifications for his difficult job , one that should not be overlooked is his amazing capacity for sustaining the antics which Washington 's otherwise highly judicious newspapermen consider to be comic . Rated according to ordinary standards , many a quarter-hour of the semiannual Gridiron Club shows displays a lack of grace , pertinence and dexterity sufficient to horrify the least critical beholder . Gridiron Club high jinks are by no means the only such doings by which the President 's endurance is regularly tested . Last week , his principal social relaxation after five working days in which 1 ) the directors of TVA carried their family squabble into his White House office ( see p. 14 ) , 2 ) the nation 's deepening Recession was abetted by the shocking business failure of an old Grottie , and 3 ) Adolf Hitler threw Europe into a panic for the second time in a month , was the annual White House Correspondents ' dinner . <P> Fun at the Correspondents ' dinner consisted of a burlesque news reel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing a song to monopolistic big business interests , cracking a whip over Congress , and greeting small businessmen . The high point was a tableau exhibiting the discovery of the tooth which the President had extracted last autumn strung on the watch chain of a visiting Elk . The entertainment also included a glimpse of Vice President Garner shooting a cow instead of a deer . <P> If Franklin Roosevelt , whose failings do not include lack of aptitude for satire , found all this strikingly inept , he did not say so . Instead , with a superb show of good manners , he thanked his hosts and went home . After the National Press Club 's dinner last November , Franklin Roosevelt retired to bed with acute indigestion . Last week 's frivolities left his health unimpaired . <P> To the Senate , Franklin Roosevelt sent the nomination of Ernest G. Draper , former Assistant Secretary of Commerce as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to replace Joseph A. Broderick who resigned last October . <P> As a basis for future legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 120,000-word report on a long-range plan recommending Federal , State and municipal expenditure of $2,100,000,000 over the next six years for flood control , irrigation and navigation improvement all over the U. S. Four days later , the President followed up the committee 's report with a message of his own , calling for a comprehensive study of developing and preserving U. S. forests . <P> In Amarillo , Tex. , Mrs. Roosevelt received the " world 's biggest bouquet " -a 2,500-pound bunch of roses , bound with chicken wire and swung on a derrick- at a celebration of Mother-in-Law Day which involved a parade with a float carrying 591 mothers-in-law , and 50,000 spectators . Said Mrs. Roosevelt : " I feel I shall think more about mothers-in-law after this . " <P> Presidential plans revealed last week : 10-day trip to Warm Springs , Ga . starting March 22.
