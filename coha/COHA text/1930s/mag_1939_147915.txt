Mad as a mother accused of starving her children so she could buy herself new dresses , Governor John W. Bricker of Ohio last week called the whole thing a lie , invited the gossips to mind their own business . <P> What made the Governor mad were the outspoken criticisms of New York City 's Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia , Interior Secretary Ickes , President Roosevelt-who , without naming names , charged that Ohio 's State Government was responsible for Cleveland 's scandalous relief situation ( TIME , Dec. 4 ) . <P> Snapped Governor Bricker , who has dark-horse aspirations for the Republican Presidential nomination : " The Federal authorities . . . seem more interested in the politics of the affair than in helping the needy . . . . The lurid catch phrases which are being used by political opponents are no more applicable in Ohio than in any other State in the U. S. " <P> " Why should n't there be a political attack on an administration as heartless as his ? " snorted Secretary Ickes . <P> Lurid or political , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical . Hundreds of tons of foodstuffs from Federal Surplus Commodities Corp . were poured into the State . President Roosevelt approved the expenditure of $1,248,991 for three new WPA projects . Cleveland saw some new money for relief in sight as its City Council approved the sale of $1,200,000 worth of bonds against delinquent taxes . But these were only stopgaps . <P> No temporary expedient could solve Ohio 's problem . Only solution in sight is through the passage of enabling legislation by the rural-dominated General Assembly , which would allow Ohio 's cities , now legally hog-tied , to raise sufficient taxes for relief . But the chance of Governor Bricker calling a special session this year , thus opening the floodgates to old-age pension bills , and possibly having the State treasury 's handsome 1939 surplus swept away , was remote . This was what still kept the gossips gossiping .
