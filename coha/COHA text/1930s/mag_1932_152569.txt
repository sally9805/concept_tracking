But Messrs . Downey &; Vallee must have been relieved to know that it was not the nightclub proprietors who paid . Exposed as anonymous benefactor to dozens of night club crooners was one George D. Phelan , 39-year-old employe of J. S. Bache &; Co. , Manhattan brokers . <P> It was the custom of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he entertained 80 or 90 guests . During the course of the evening Mr. Phelan would grow sadder &; sadder . He would request the house crooner to sing an Irish song . During the singing Mr. Phelan invariably wept . He then tipped the singer according to the copiousness of his tears . On the basis of these tips was compiled the above wage scale . The beneficiaries , who did not know Mr. Phelan 's name , called him simply " The Big Mick from Down Town . " <P> One day George D. Phelan , whose salary was recently cut from $100 to $60 per week , confided to Cashier Alfred L. Goldman of J. S. Bache &; Co. that he had stolen $695,000 from the firm 's petty cash fund in the past 13 years . He told Cashier Goldman he was confessing " because I know I ca n't continue these thefts forever . " <P> For a month Embezzler Phelan helped auditors to straighten out his books . Last week he was arraigned on a charge of stealing $1,900 , his last peculation . Said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lawyer , but if I can get out on bail I may be able to find some . " A truckman furnished $20,000 bail .
