WPA symphony orchestras employ unemployed musicians . But they seldom draw crowds or move their listeners to rafter-raising applause . An exception to this rule is Chicago 's WPA orchestra , the Illinois Symphony . When it was first organized in 1935 the Illinois Symphony was one of the Federal Music Project 's ugly ducklings . For a year it bettelhtooped almost unnoticed . In the summer of 1936 , the Music Project 's pompous national director , Nikolai Sokoloff , went to Chicago to rehearse it for a concert under his own baton . When he heard it play he was afraid to be seen in public with it . Hastily recommending a new conductor and a shakeup in personnel , Director Sokoloff left town . <P> Then things began to happen . Word soon spread around that the show at the Great Northern Theatre was worth the price of admission ( 55 top ) . Chicago 's best critics ventured inside , came out beaming . Music lovers began to go , found that Chicago 's most energetic baton-waving and most stimulating symphonic programs were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WPAsters still worked on at their regular $94-a-month salary , the Illinois Symphony actually began to pile up a profit at the box office . The size of this profit put it in a different class from most other WPA orchestras , enabled it to pay the high performance royalties asked by such ace contemporary composers as Dmitri Shostakovich , Serge Prokofieff , Paul Hindemith , Jean Sibelius . <P> When great Finnish Composer Sibelius ' Fifth and Sixth Symphonies got their first Chicago hearings , it was not the venerable Chicago Symphony but the sprouting Illinois Symphony that played them . The Illini played few symphonic chestnuts , never repeated a composition . By the end of last season they were giving even more " first performances " than Serge Kousse-vitzky 's pioneering Boston Symphony . Some of their firsts were imported , some domestic . Last week they played their hundredth composition by a U. S. composer . <P> The man behind the Illinois Symphony 's sudden artistic and box-office success is no imported , caviar-fed maestro , but a pint-sized , 29-year-old Midwestern musician named Izler Solomon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , he left the job of reorganizing the orchestra in Solomon 's hands . A shrewd young man , as well as a talented maestro , Conductor Solomon saw at a glance that his WPA outfit could never compete on the same grounds with the seasoned , long-established Chicago Symphony . So he and State Project Director Albert Goldberg planned something different . Leaving the classics to white-mustached Frederick Stock , they concentrated on the moderns that Stock was too busy to play . Some of them were not worth playing . But all of them were news . Soon the Illinois Symphony was rated as Chicago 's spiciest highbrow musical institution , and Chicago 's wide-awake concertgoers were afraid to stay away for fear of missing something good .
