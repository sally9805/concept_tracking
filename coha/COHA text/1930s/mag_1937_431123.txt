 | The Dilemma of a Pacifist Condensed from Ladies ' Home Journal Dorothy Vompson ALL MY life . I have been a pacifist . I have contributed to peace societies , written , spoken and paraded for peace . But today I question whether our ways of seeking peace are not playing into the hands of those who love war . I see nations arming in ways never before known . I am not speaking of new forms of poison gas , swifter bombing planes , or other " improved " techniques of war ; but of the fact that the minds of men , women and children are being deliberately distorted , by every conceivable instrument of education and propaganda , to make them receptive of war . The greatest menace in the world today is not poison gas , but poisoned ideas . A hundred and fifty million Russians have been told over and over that an Armageddon is coming in which world capitalism will confront world communism and communism will triumph . Sixtyfive million Germans are being told that cannons are more precious than butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German People are destined to expand and to change the character of the earth . Forty million Italians are trained to despise peace and to glory in war . And all of young Japan is brought up to admire the warrior as the highest type of citizen . I have seen a German youth camp , housing 6ooo children around the age of ten , display in treehigh letters : " You were born to die for Germany ! " I have seen babies of six and seven , blackshirted and belted , march in Italy in military drill . I have seen children in Russian kindergartens taught how to adjust gas masks , and the strategy of trench warfare . Once , wherever one might go in the world , one found men and women who dreamed of peace , and worked to help find new means of arbitration , disarmament , and international collaboration . Today , whole nations are hermetically sealed to all such ideas . Today in Germany the winner of the last Nobel peace prize is considered a traitor , and to attend any peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today in Italy there is only one morality : the power and glory of Italy . Today in Russia all children are brought up to despise and hate " the class enemy . " In Russia the task of building industry is likely to postpone dreams of conquest . But no such considerations curb other dictatorships . Within the last years we have seen Japan invade China in violation of numerous treaties , Italy invade Ethiopia in a cynically open war of conquest , whole German and Italian armies land in Spain to aid a military attack on a legal , parliamentary government . Where will all this end , and does it not demand a revaluation of what we mean by keeping the peace ? Does anyone really think that there will ever be peace except inside the general acceptance of certain principles of international behavior ? " It takes two to agree , " says Hamilton Fish Armstrong in his polemic against dictatorship called We or They , " but it only takes one to make a war . " Are we , then , going to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever you please . So long as you do n't touch us , it 's no concern of ours " ? Actually that is what we are saying , with our present neutrality policy . We are saying , " Break treaties , invade other nations , bomb cities , starve women and children , and we will take our ships off the seas and fold our hands . You can count on our doing nothing . " We contribute to world anarchy by such words , and hope that we , alone , will be spared the results of that anarchy- ! But in a world where anarchy rules , no one is safe . The world today is divided into two groups of nations : those whose leaders teach them a belief in violence , aggrandizement , that success validates any procedure ; and those who cling to a belief in law , in the sanctity of treaties , and in arbitration . To the latter group still belong the strongest , richest and most stable nations on earth : the United States , the British Empire , France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe . Those who have resigned from the common faith , the common intention of international behavior according to law , are strong only in will and ruthlessness . Yet they have driven the world upon the defensive . Is n't it time , perhaps , to take an offensive ? Would it not be wiser to say , " We want no war , but we shall not be blackmailed nor condone violence . We are not disinterested in the fate of free government in the world . All friends of order , law and arbitration are our friends . We shall support them when and as we see fit . Do not count upon our neutrality " ? The expression of such an attitude would enormously  | strengthen the moral forces on the side of peace . Perhaps it seems so to me because I know now that there are things for which I am prepared to die . I am willing to die for political freedom , for the right to give my loyalty to ideals above a nation or above a class , for the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to some dictator 's code , for the right to explore such knowledge as my brains can penetrate , for the right to work with others of like mind , for a society which seems to me becoming to the dignity of the human race . I shall pick no fight , nor seek to impose by force these standards on others . But let it be clear . If the fight comes unsolicited , I am not willing to die meekly , to surrender without an effort . And that being so , am I still a pacifist ?
