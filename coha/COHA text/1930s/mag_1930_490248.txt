THE electric light , as you know , is fifty years and three months old and is practically a sure thing . Mr. Edison , therefore , must have a certain amount of time on his hands for other inventions . We do n't know who supplies him with ideas , or even whether he employs a " feeder ; " but for a long time we 've had an idea for an invention and maybe this is the moment to divulge it . Certainly Edison is the only man we 'd trust it with . The idea is this : someone should invent a way to use bath salts in a shower bath . At present , the only way is to dump the salts in the Kensico Reservoir  --  and that 's a long dusty trip to make before one 's bath . ONE thing we 've noticed about characters in plays  --  they never open a window when they go to bed . Why is that , do you suppose ? A minor point , perhaps , but it 's beginning to get on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage , but we ca n't recall one in which any character , about to retire , had the common decency to open a window in the bedroom . They do everything else  --  put out the cat , take off their clothes ( or , as in " Strictly Dishonorable , " take off other people 's clothes ) , brush their teeth , put out the light , and then slip into bed without letting any air into the room . Stuffy , we call it . TT strikes us that the telephone com-1- pony has been most apologetic about its rate increase . A polite organization if ever there was one  --  polite and a bit contrite . By its action , the company has , incidentally , set up a new social order : to some thousands of very important people the company sent a personal representative to explain the increase , and apologize for it ; to all other subscribers it sent merely a letter from the president . Surely no clearer alignment has ever been made between people who mattered socially and people who did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we despise the great herd who received nothing but a letter from the president ! WHEN the French Line sent out invitations to its reception aboard the Paris , it figured that only about forty per cent would show up . This nice calculation was based on pre-panic social conditions , and apparently things have changed  --  acceptances came in overwhelming numbers , so that the steamship people were hard put to know what to do with all their guests . The same thing is true , we notice , of other parties around town this winter : almost everybody who is invited attends . It is an amusing result of the Wall Street affair  --  fewer people can afford to entertain and more people have the leisure to go out . It 's a boon to steamship companies , publishers , and the like , who entertain purposefully , and a bit of good fortune to the populace . WE are quite interested in Chi- cago 's attempt to keep her poets from leaving home , and are willing to help . Chicago complains that they all drift to New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five thousand dollars a year in an attempt to induce writers to stay right within the city limits of Chicago . Of course , this is a revolutionary idea  --  giving poets a civic value in the eyes of the Chamber of Commerce ; and besides being revolutionary , it wo n't work . Poets do n't come to New York to get wealthy , they come in the hope of finding their true dream of starvation . This is a wonderful starving ground , with ideal facilities for starving on any income up to about forty thousand dollars . Poets know that , and they flock here , arriving in trains , airplanes , limousines , and fast motor launches every hour of the day . Fortunately , New York is in a unique position with regard to its writers ; New York can act independently of poets , because the city has a good harbor , excellent railroad connections , good roads , electric lights , a magnificent water-supply system , and a lively fur trade . We could get along without incoming Chicago poets almost indefinitely . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who came here from Chicago , they are very good writers , but from a civic standpoint it would probably pay our Chamber of Commerce to keep them out of town . Village Druggist t ROM Sixty-sixth Street to 11 lth in Central Park West , two miles and a fraction , there is but one drugstore  --  Neulander 's , at Ninety-ninth . Isolated thus , before the bleak steppes of upper Central Park , you naturally find a peculiar sort of place . Neulander 's Pharmacy is pretty much a country store . No stove occupies the centre of the room , but it might just as well , for the store is full of neighbors these winter evenings , sitting around and chatting . For many years Mr. Neulander has attended to the medicinal wants of the surrounding blocks , and also to many other things . Not only is he ready to turn out personally in the middle of the night to succor a case of whooping cough , but he can be called on for most any service . It is , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency . He has put in a circulating library and supplies books to his clients . His wife is commissioned as a notary public . He will get you theatre tickets , advise in household accounting ( he has a budget system he advocates for young wives ) , or recommend a servant . Or he will kill a live chicken your friends sent you from the South , lend you silverware for a dinner party , or tell you how to get your brother down from Yale out of Mr. Neulander is inventive generally . Taxi-drivers , dropping in for remedies or advice , used to complain of the effect of sleet on their windshields . He worked out a liquid which he christened Magic Anti-Freeze Windshield Mixture , and now whenever it snows or sleets he stations a boy out at the curb with a supply of this and a pail of hot water . Cabmen and other motorists drive up and have their windshields cleaned and treated with the mixture . Price , fifty cents . Also , he works out individual perfumes for women patrons . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth . This information he sends to a numerologist , who specifies the color and the flower appropriate . He then makes up the perfume from the given flower in the color named . Negroes , who have moved into the neighborhood in large numbers , stump ed Mr. Neulander for a time . Ire could n't understand them , and anyhow they have a way of asking for any drug that has a high-sounding name , whether it is the remedy they need or not . He finally met the situation by engaging a negro clerk , who unravels the colored people 's problems and submits a simplified report . Neulander 's lacks the old-fashioned pestle and mortar seen in the window of most of the older chemists ' places , but he is installing one soon . Customers with an eye to detail persuaded him to do so . IN one of the new buildings in Lexington Avenue , incidentally , a drugstore of the new type has opened up with its walnut fittings and up-to-date ways . Nevertheless , it has its note of conservatism . Art early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame de Pompadour . " " We do n't carry it , " said the clerk . Favoring her with a grave look , he added : " You know , she was a very unscrupulous woman . " Baby-Buzzer A " ' NG electrical engineer having a baby , a wife that worries about it whenever they go out , a salary so modest that he can not employ a nursemaid , and an old cigar box , put his mind to work a few weeks ago and evolved a pretty neat little contraption , something like the telephone but more like the Televox . To one . side of the cigar box he attached a telephone diaphragm . Inside it he placed transformers , radio tubes , coils , all arranged according to the mystical formulas of electricity . From the bottom two wires lead off , one to a light socket , the other to a buzzer in a neighbor 's apartment . Now , whenever he and his wife go out of an evening , the cigar box stands by the baby 's crib , silently watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does , the first yip out of it sets the diaphragm vibrating , the various other sections of the instrument respond , and the upshot is that , two floors down in the neighbor 's apartment , the buzzer emits a warning buzz . The neighbor is a good soul , and knows just what to do in such cases . Higher Learning THE zealous collector who gave us all the facts about the miniature lead-soldier armies of the world a while back now comes forward with an additional item to keep us up-to-date . Clarence Cook Little , retiring president of the University of Michigan , has given his collection up  --  turned it over to his son . Michigan , however , still has a formidable group of armies , owned by another member of the faculty , Professor Donal Hamilton Haines , who has been marshalling toy soldiers since 1905 , when the Russo-Japanese War revived an interest he had had as a boy . He has a fighting force of about seven hundred now , representing thirty-two different armies , each roan meticulously accurate in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collectors . He once had seventeen hundred soldiers , many of which he had cast himself , but he had to throw away over half of them in one swoop . He had gone in heavily for Latin Americans . One sad day he learned that nearly all of these warriors were wrong as to uniforms cod trappings . He gave up this whole branch of his service after an appeal to the War Department at Washington . The Quartermaster General advised him that he himself had been unable to keep track of the military regalia of Central and South American countries . All he knew for certain was that all South American generals wore boots . Professor Haines invented a war game twenty years ago which has interested many members of the faculty of Michigan for years . The elements of the armies move according to the turn of a roulette wheel . He has kept a record of all engagements thus fought since 1910 . One lasted three days , and occupied the attention of ten professors all of the time they were not in classrooms , The results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which fights in its shirtsleeves , licked the whole German army , and his Marine Brigade , who battle in overcoats , conquered England . Courage ! ONLY now did our report come in on the fire at the Explorers ' Club dinner . The banquet-room had been put in darkness for the showing of a motion picture when the film burst into flames . Some people started to move pretty swiftly and noisily for the exits . At this point a diner climbed on a chair and shouted : " Gentlemen ! Gentlemen ! This is the Explorers ' Club ! " Everybody was instantly calmed by this rebuke , and sat down . The fire continued in an orderly fashion until put out . Skins You Love to Touch ' AMONG the many Wall Street rumors was the one about fur-coat cancellations . People said the big fur firms were swamped with cancelled orders . This appears not to have been true  --  Gunther , Revillon , jaeckel smile when you mention it , and counter with a cryptic reply : " The sable is a very shy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have been taught by one deep in the fur business . Sable coats go from twenty thousand dollars up , and a single pelt can be worth twenty-five hundred . The average coat requires about one hundred skins , so theoretically it is possible to make a coat worth two hundred and fifty thousand dollars  --  but only theoretically , because no one could ever get a hundred **25;568;TOOLONG skins together . The most costly coat sold recently seems to have been one by jaeckel fur *eighty thousand and no one-hundredths dollars . jaeckel has sold three sable coats this year , Revillon and Gunther one or two each ( we 're a little vague on the figures ) . About six are sold every year . There are possibly fifty coats in town . Mrs. Edward Hutton is one of the heaviest sable buyers  --  has two or three coats and half a dozen neckpieces . The little animal that all this fuss is made about is a member of the weasel family and lives in the dark , cold forests of Siberia  --  the darker and colder the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must he very dark and long . The Soviet Government controls the output , and calmly executes anyone found smuggling a pelt over the Manchurian border . Sable hunting is a fine art , the most skillful hunters electing not to trap or shoot the animal , but to tree it , thus preventing possible injury to the pelt . When they get an animal treed , they knock it into a net . Mr. Jaeckel , Mr. Gunther , and Mr. Revillon hold the act . No attempt has been made to breed sables  --  it would probably he more complicated than foxes , the sable being a very shy beast . In certain parts of Siberia it is forbidden to catch them at all , since the government is anxious to prevent their extinction . Anxious to the point of being worried sick . As things are now , about twelve thousand skins come out of Siberia every year , of which only about three thousand are suitable for making coats .

Gunther has two , for twenty-four hundred dollars each . just in passing , we might add that being exiled to Siberia has its points : one of the largest sable dealers , before the war , was a man sent to Siberia for murder . He made good . Almost as shy as the sable is the chinchilla . It inhabits the Andes in South America , and for the past five years has been living the life of Riley , enjoying the complete protection of the law . Any chinchilla coat you buy is from smuggled skins . The last legal coat was made up and sold this year . There is another chinchilla that resides in Peru , ritzier than the Andes kind  --  so ritzy , in fact , as to be almost extinct . He is known as the Royal Peruvian . It is with a profound feeling of pride that we close our lecture by telling where the best mink skins come from . They come not from the Orient , not from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is n't that marvellous ? The coats run from two thousand dollars to twenty-five thousand dollars , so a lot of minks never get very far from where they are born . Incognito THE Medical Center is calmer now , but just after Tunney arrived there the excitement was terrific . Young intcrnes went around shadowboxing . There was a general slicking-up all along the line , The head nurse told the orderly for Heaven 's sake to put on a clean apron , and the chambermaid went out and got a permanent before she went in to clean up the room . Many of the nurses managed to stroll down the Tunney corridor on one pretext or another , but all they saw was a dosed door bearing the misleading but simple name , " Mr. Brown . " Gentlemen , Inc . I was about eighteen years ago that A Dr. Arcadius Avellanus of Brooklyn began talking Latin to his buddies , Mr. Herbert Cornwell and Dr. Leffingwell Hedge . They used to meet in small restaurants twice a week , to speak to each other in Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposed to foregather with them and talk Latin . Now there are twenty of them . When they get together , they keep minutes in Latin , read papers in Latin , eat dinner practically in Latin , and when they have nothing else to do they write each other letters in Latin , beginning " lair Clarissime " and ending " Tibi obsequentissimus . " This sort of thing keeps a member in good spirits for weeks . They are incorporated  --  The Society of Latin Gentlemen , Inc . Dr. Avellanus is now eighty , and is probably the greatest Latin scholar in the country . He used to teach in Brooklyn , but now only gives occasional private lessons Hungarian by birth , he speaks Latin with complete fluency , and his idea is that it should be taught as a living language instead of a dead one . That is why he has translated popular books into Latin , among them " Treasure Island , " which you will be glad to know is called " Insula Thesaurica , " and another book which we will let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also three or four other books , one of them a detective story . These tomes are published by Mr. E. Parmalee Prentice , who is sort of patron of the Doctor . The charter members , we understand , are still going strong after all these years . Duncan in Harlem TUST one final story about Raymond Duncan , before winding up . It seems that among the groups he has re-cently addressed on Art , Relaxation , etc. , was one of the haughtiest and most cultured o f the Harlein intellectual cliques . They are distinctly of the Booker T. Wash-ington tradition and have nothing in common with mod-em jazz tendencies . Of this Mr. Duncan did not seem fully aware . During the course of the soiree he was asked why he had come to Ameri-ca , and more speci-fically to Harlem . He explained that he had been inspired to make the pil-grimage after hear-ing American col-ored jazz bands play in various places on the Riviera . One especially attracted him  --  Charlie Johnson 's Jazz-Boys , or something of the sort . " And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back and meet you all  --  the brothers and sisters of Charlie Johnson 's Jazz-Boys . " Brown Brothers CHAMBERLAIN BROWN probably has the biggest acquaintance of anyone on Broadway , unless it 's his brother Lyman . The two Browns know every actor in town , and most of the opera singers and prizefighters also . Their business is placing actors in parts . If an actor gets a job through them he pays a certain commission and , naturally , it behooves them to keep in close touch with the situation . They are a godsend to managers . If a difficult play comes along , the Browns must know where the available actors best fitted to the roles can be found . To be thus ready at all times the brothers keep many and enormous scrapbooks , the greatest collection of theatrical clippings in the world . The books occupy most of the space in two large rooms at the agents ' offices in Forty-fifth Street . Every actor of any consequence has a book to himself , some of them more . Jeritza and Jack Dempsey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let people borrow the scrapbooks any more . An opera singer took hers out once and was so pleased with it that she kept it . A play needs a red-headed actor , say . The management queries the Browns . They refer to a cross-index of their scrapbooks . This tells them that James Cagney is in Harrisburg , Allen Bunce in South Norwalk , and Charles Bickford in Skowhegan . The agents offer the jobs to these men . If none arc available they have plenty more listed . They have inexhaustible lists of special types  --  juveniles , all kinds of character actors , German-speaking players , actors who can play this or that kind of musical instrument , six-foot men , old people , children of all ages , and SO on . The Browns do their own clipping of newspapers . They like to . They have liked clipping newspapers ever since they were children , and it is this that led them into their present business . As youngsters in Boston they began cutting out pictures and items about actors and pasting them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the theatre , acting part of the time , hanging around stages regardless , if he was unemployed . He and his brother kept up the scrapbooks , nevertheless . Chamberlain found he had constructive ideas about the stage . Suggestions he volunteered to directors and producers were adopted . This led him to believe that the scrapbooks had commercial possibilities . He and his brother opened up as casting agents , and were successful . During the days in Boston , when Chamberlain was eight or nine , he met R. F. Outcault , the cartoonist . He had bobbed hair , wore a wide collar , and looked pretty cute . Outcault asked him to pose . The casual drawing made then was the origin of the famous comics , " Buster Brown . " Tige , the bulldog , was born the same day , but out of Outcault 's imagination . He just added him to the picture of Chamberlain Brown as an impulse . There never was an original . When not clipping , or at other office work , the Browns spend much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben-Ami this way , and Judith Anderson , William Gaxton , Edna May Oliver , and many others . They live together , have a Pekinese apiece , and look much alike . At noon they can usually be found at Sardi 's Restaurant , sitting under the framed caricature of Chamberlain . Civic Force RARELY ? oh , so rarely1 ? do we receive concrete evidence of our influence in the community , although naturally we arc vaguely aware that ours is a great power . A specific and an impressive instance is now reported , however . It follows our mention a few weeks since of a conductor on the Eighth Street line who amuses himself with a toy mouse , which he leaves in the aisle of his car to frighten women passengers .
