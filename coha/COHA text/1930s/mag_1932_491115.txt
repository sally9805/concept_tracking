, REU2E9 TOY/ EI LEMU A INVOLUNTARY chill started a responsive wave motion along my spinal voittnIlk when a boy from the telegraph olliee handed me the envelope . Snow covered the trees and the houses and the streets of Seward , and from a dull , leaden Alaskan sky snow was still falling . one felt very content to remain indoors in old John de Brille 's Alaska House and watch two old sourdoughs play cribbage , using a Bering Sea carved walrus tusk for a counter , and emitting the while clouds of smoke from ancient pipes and good old brands of tobacco long since obsolete in the social smoking circles of today . A week previous the Admiral Farrago had rolled me across the gulf nu ( If Alaska , and I was awaiting , late in Janua ry , t i IP fort nightly Seward-Fairbanks train , so that I could start my long dog mush through the interior of Alaska to the Bering Sea . Four years of Alaskan exploration among its huge glaciers and volcanoes had toughened me to packing and climbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T HE train pulled out of Seward and , with a break for a good night 's sleep at the luxurious Hotel Curry in McKinley Park , arrived two days la ter at Nenana . It was early in the afternoon , but pitch dark . My summer land of the midnight sun had reversed into the land of the noonday night in winter . Fat her McElmeel met me . Square-shouldered , blue-eyed , steel-gray-haired , Father Mac , as he is known all through Alaska , was reputed one of the best mushers on the Yukon and had gathered a team of dogs for me along the 400-mile route from Nulato to Nenana . Dogs ! All the dog stories I had ever read came to my mind , and now I had the chance to see how true they were  --  the famous Alaska Husky , the Male-mute , the Siberian  --  all faithful companions of man " This is Snookum , " said Father McElmeel , flashing an electric torch on a magnificent brute chained to the nearest dog stall . " Better not touch him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , as he is three-quarters lIa Snookum inspired fear at first sight . He stood stiff-legged and motionless , with ears held back and head lowered , and his gleaming eyes followed one 's every movement warily . His muzzle was crisscrossed with scars and his head and ears bore marks of many a fierce battle . " His looks are against him , " Father McElmeel said , " but he is one of the best pullers on the Yukon , and absolutely tireless . . . Are n't you , Snookum , old man ? " ? this time addressing the wolf dog arid giving him an affectionate pat on the head . Strookum galvanized into motion . wagged his tail vigorously and gave a throaty howl-like rumble which was his form of welcome to a much-beloved master . " And how is little Nancy ? " Father Mac said , this time to a coal-black canine whose only relationship to the wolf clan showed in the Oriental slant and nervous movement of her eyes . know you used females on a team , " I Warrior Comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably give you that impression , " answered Father Mae . " We Alaskans do n't know very much about what dog teams ought to be ; we only know what they are . Females are steadier pullers than male dogs , and if you keep them from fighting they will work fine for you . " Two big dogs lay curled up on the snow outside their boxes . One was a tawny monster that looked more like a lion than a dog ; the second was a typical wolf . " There are the two hardest workers on the team , Prince and Warrior . " Warrior , the tawny one , rose and stretched with a yawn and , gently standing up on his hind legs , put his paws on Father Mae 's shoulders , while the latter rubbed his back affectionately . Prince meanwhile rubbed his ribs against Father Mac 's mukluks . " Yes , old Princie , you sure owe your life to Warrior , don't. you ? " Prince " Ya-a-awed " his wolf response , and Father Mae continued to me : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a lot of them died . Prince got the distemper and finally became so weak and suffered so much that it seemed more merciful to bump him off . Then Warrior came to the rescue . He loved Prince and did n't want him to die . He used to come up to where Prince was lying and lick his eyes and muzzle for hours at a time every day . Warrior licked all the distemper poison away , and eventually Prince got well . For four years they have been pulling side by side , and a more devoted dog friendship I have never seen . " As if to prove the words of his master , Warrior slipped down and gave Prince 's nose a side wipe with his tongue , Prince returning the salute with interest . The First Note of the Dog Opera " m HERE is the only blue blood on the team " - " pointing to a sharp-eared , rather small , but well-built Siberian . " Toxin was born on the day of the famous serum race , when Leonhard Seppala brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got his name . He was on the famous Joe Stickman 's racing team a few years back that made an all-time , never-beaten record in the Fairbanks Dog Derby . And now look at this beauty ! . . . Here , Margie ! " Father Mac called , and after an audible yawn , out of a box stepped the most beautiful Malemute I ever saw . She was a picture dog . Beautiful pointed ears , black outside and white-lined within , white spots on black , silky fur over most expressive eyes , broad-chested , strong-limbed  --  the very dog that one conjures up in imagination when thinking of the noble Alaskan sled dog . Margie was going on two years old , and full of fun too . She promptly acknowledged our presence by rolling around on the snow , and began to strike at us with her paws . A quick spring and she had Father Mac 's glove , and with mock-serious growls started to worry it . We crunched over the snow toward our cabin . " What 's t hat. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ howl broke the frigid silence . " That 's the leader giving the dog opera the note , " laughed Father Mac . " Now listen . " The first howl was succeeded by another from a different quarter , then another , then a bark or two , followed by a series of yelps ; and then , from several hundred throats at once , bedlam broke loose . It was the famous bedtime chorus of the Alaskan wolf dog . Almost impossible to describe , it was weirdly inspiring . It sent a shudder down your back , it . sounded like the cry of lost souls , it was the call of the wild . When the first dog started , every dog in Nenana leaped up from snug slumber and , pointing his nose at the moon , howled dismally . Soon all the howls blended into one volume of sound that reminded me more of the New Year 's Eve midnight clamor of San Francisco heard from suburban foothills than anything else . The volume of the dog chorus rose until it sounded as if scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open on the high notes , and then , right . at the height of the crescendo , the chorus stopped as suddenly as it began , and the silence of the Alaskan night continued . I heard the dog opera every night for the next four months , and it was always weirdly the same . We prepared my heavy photographic equipment for packing that night . Clothing , sleeping bags and food bad been speedily made ready , and when the native boys who had harnessed up the sled for us swung around the Nenana street that dark winter morning , every one of the thirteen dogs was howling and straining at the harness , impatient to be off . When a dog has been on the chain a few days , he is wild to go , and if too much time is taken to pack up the sled , he gets impatient , begins to chew up his harness , looks for a fight . The twelve-footlong sled is made of tough hickory and lashed with walrus thongs . The runners extend a foot . or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them . Between them is the brake  --  a claw of steel that is jammed into the snow by foot pressure when needed . The dog team that gave me my first ideas of mushing had been a Christmas group done in wax as a table decoration , and showed the driver comfortably seated in furs on the sled and holding reins extending to each dog . This grouping inspired quite a jingle-bell sense of Yuletide comfort , but . oh , how far from the real thing . No reins are used to guide dogs . They would be chewed up in a moment . A tough rope called the towline is hooked to the front of the sled . At appropriate intervals along the towline smaller ropes about a foot in length , called neck lines , are woven into the towline. with steel clasps at the free ends . Each dog has a harness consisting of a padded collar that slips over his head like a horse collar . From it a simple extension of leather strap with a sureingle goes to a singletree and makes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towline . The neck line is snapped on to the collar and the dog is ready to exert his pulling power to best advantage . A blacksnake whip is the only pretense to authority , and all guiding is done by vocal expulsions of vowels and consonants found by experience to bring about the desired effect . A LADY school-teacher , part of a steamship-tourist group , af ter listening to some dog-mushing stories said , " But you do n't swear at the dogs , do you ? " " It is n't swearing to call a dog by his real name , is it ? " I answered . " However , my classical education proved a real advantage in dog mushing . By yelling the Greek alphabet at them I got . a better pulling response than the most 4 .. orrect mushing language could produce . " " But how do the dogs know which way to go ? " that fair questioner ( ' OIlI limed . Wishing to avoid farther queries , I answered , laughing , " ' Well , it is this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisper in his ear where you Ivant to go . He starts off on a gallop , and the other dogs chase the leader all day to Lind out where they are going , and meanwhile you get there . " At Nenana that morning I was wondering what was going to happen myself . The sled was lashed to a post . by a heavy rope . A native held the leader at the end of the long line of dogs , and Father Mac and the other native bey deftly and speedily packed everything into the sled . A canvas enveloped all and was securely roped to the sled . I could see why experience and speed were necessary  --  experience to distribute the weight priperly , and speed on account of the dogs . They were yelping and leaping forward to get started . Warrior was yelling like a maniac .. The delay was getting on ' his nerves . After a leap to the start . he suddenly turned and wily his sharp fangs chewed through his neck line . This occasioned a few minutes ' more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervousness . First Lessons in Dog Driving " Stand clear ! " he shouted , and the native boy freed 4iis hold o1. r ) aisy , tht straining leader . " Jump on and hold tight , " he directed me . He pulled the knot on the post rope , the sled creaked and off went the dogs . I certainly held tight as the sled swung and bounced over the frozen ground and headed fur the river . We missed stumps by inches , and the dogs were still in full gallop when we came to the river bank . They avalanched over the edge and fairly Clew out . on the snow-covered ice of the Tanana as Father Mae ground down on the brake to ease t he sled along the steep bank . Dogs always gallop with nervous energy at the beginning of the day . It is good to let them run themselves out for a while , and then steady them down to the trot that will keep them from tiring . We ( Tossed the river and followed the trail into the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fir and birch deeked in snow lined I he trail and fifty-two canine feet went with the regularity of engine pistons as the swish of the sled runners played the only accompaniment to the pat , pat , pat , pat . It was twenty degrees below zero , just ten degrees less than the thirty degrees below of ideal mushing weather . r lieg-an to catch the exhilaration and thought that there was really nothing to it . The dogs had steadied down to a trot . Father Mae put on the brake and stopped the team . " Hop off , " he said to me , " and take charge . It is your team and you 'd better begin right now . " He handed me the Whip and took his foot off the brake as I stood clumsily on the runner . Suddenly the dogs leaped ahead and I took a header into the snowy bushes off the trail .. " I expected that to happen , " Father Mac said , seizing the sled bow and ( Continued clamping on the brake . " Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your control of the sled . If you lose your sled in the North , you lose your life . The dogs get away . Then you freeze up , because all your furs and sleeping bag are on the runaway sled . " I never forgot the lesson . The second lesson was less important and I learned it myself . Father Mac handed me the whip again . I got on the sled and said " Get up " to the dogs . About half of them turned around with their tongues out , and I could swear they were laughing at me . Then I dramatically yelled " Mush , you Malemutes ! " at them , and it was likewise a most dismal flop . They remained immovable . Father Mac was enjoying my novice attempts at dog mushing , and said , " Crack the whip at them . " I %vas too proud to admit that I did not know how to snap the long whiplash , so , bravely describing a few circles through the air , I threw the heavy butt forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dull swish and I saw stars . The snakelike lash , in my inexperienced hands , had described various clumsy parabolic " I 'll run along behind awhile to get warm , " Father Mac said , " and you drive the team . " This time I got them started all right , and they pulled t he heavy sled as Father Mac jogged on a few hundred feet back . I found it quite enjoyable , swinging the sled around the curves , wrestling it into the right tracks and keeping the dogs pulling in unison . A dog musher has to keep his attention as constantly riveted on his dogs as an automobile driver on his steering wheel . I did not know this , though . I was getting drowsy and turned around to see how Father Mae was coming along . I must have turned around too long , for things began to happen very rapidly . Snookum had become interested in a hush and had stopped . Snookum was way up in the swing , right after the leader , and when he stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to jam the brake down and keep the line of dogs strung out . Instead of that , though , I allowed the heavy sled to keep on going and pushed the dogs together , telescoping the whole team . When an Alaska dog feels anything touch him , the wolf instinct to lunge out comes to the fore . Bill , the wheel dog , bumped Warrior , and Warrior turned to fight . Prince leaped in to help Warrior , since , in a gang fight , the two always stuck together . Pete jumped Snookum and they went at it in real shape . Toxin stepped aside , protecting himself from the flying fangs , for Toxin was a Siberian , and Siberians dislike fighting . Margie crouched down into the snow and let . the pack fight it out over her . I was hoping the females would n't fight , as they usually fight to the death . But Nancy got excited and in the struggling mass picked out her rival , Daisy , and called her something very awful in dog language . Daisy made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and varicolored fur flew . " Stop them ! " yelled Father Mac , coming up on a run . " You will have a hunch of dead dogs if you do n't hurry up ! " The Best Dog Team in Xlaska Every man to his own hobby . What did I know about stopping such a big dog fight ? I knew how to take pictures , though ; so I buzzed my motion-picture camera at the scene while Father Mac stopped the fight . After all , that was his hobby . It took a lot of strenuous whip work to unlock head holds and leg holds , and the harness was in an awful tangle . " Pretty lucky , " Father Mac muttered . " You usually lose a dog or two in a light like that . " Snookum 's nose had a few more rips , Pete 's ear was bobbed a bit more , Bill had a. cut on his leg and Nancy had a bloody lip , but no serious damage was done . Father Mac vas with me all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadhouses or sourdoughs ' cabins at nighttime and experienced the bighearted hospitality of Alaska 's real Alaskans . Linder such able tutelage I learned the tricks of dog mushing before leaving Nulato for the Bering Sea . With side trips to various Jesuit missions along the Yukon , I had mapped out a course of more than 1600 miles of mushing for that winter . " Mush ! " ? this time I knew how to start the dogs right . I was leaving the Yukon to go over 1 he Kaltag Mountains to Norton Sound . Dog mushing on the coast is very different . The cold is damp and penetrating , and the tundra makes easier pulling than the talcum-powderlike snow of the interior . Eighty-seven degrees below zero has been registered at Birches on the middle Yukon , but forty degrees below of damp cold on the coast would be equally fatal . The hickory runners of the sled are changed to iron and dog power is cut down for the Bering Sea . I left four clogs at Nulato , and the nine that I took for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alaska . Every dog musher considers his team the best , so I am no exception . Daisy was the leader , Margie and Snookum were the first . pair , or swing dogs ; then came Nancy and Pete , Prince and Warrior , lastly Katmai and Bill , the wheel dogs , or those next to the sled . Joe Stickman was running his racing dogs to Nome for the dog races , so he 38 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST February 13,1932 ( Continued from Page 36 ) broke trail over the Kaltag Portage for me . His dogs averaged ten miles an hour there , and mine , with the heavy load , could do only six . It was an advantage , though , to follow tracks , so I pushed on through the woods . It had been growing steadily darker and soon began to snow heavily ; before long the dogs were floundering chest-deep . In this extremity all you could do was to put on your snowshoes and trudge wearily ahead of your team , tramping down the snow so they could follow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs ' feet constantly . The snow was wet and balls of ice would form between their toes . It is necessary to run one 's fingers through and take the ice out or a dog will go lame . The snow stopped finally and I drove on into the dark between cathedral aisles of stately trees . The storm had slowed us up and the dogs were tired , so I realized that I could never make the shelter cabin at Old Woman Mountain , the halfway point to Norton Sound . I stopped in a little open space in the woods and started to care for the dogs . Each dog has to be chained up separately at night . This took more than half an hour , as I had to find convenient trees and trample down the snow for the dogs . A Cold Night in the Open It . had been the toughest day of the trip and the first time I had to sleep out in the open all winter . Some of the dogs were sweating as the snow approached a thaw . Fearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I took my reserve of straw and put a bed of it under each dog . Many a cold nose snuggled affectionately into my hand that Arctic night on the Kaltag Portage as the faithful animals showed their appreciation . After bedding them down and letting them rest sufficiently , I took their meal from the sled and gave each dog his portion . One whole dried salmon each day for each dog is ample . If you feed them in the morning they wo n't work , so the food is always given at night . I took a drink of hot coffee from a vacuum bottle , ate a salmon strip and a frozen doughnut , and was ready for bed . I put my sleeping bag on the snow near the sled and crawled in . Pulling it over my head , I breathed heavily until a coating of ice stiffened the fabric and insured enough air , and though a bit cold , passed a fairly comfortable night . Very early in the morning we started , hoping to make Unalakleet that day . It . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned cold and the dogs were feeling good . We made fine time out of the mountains and were well out . on the tundra before we had any trouble . About five miles from Unalakleet the blizzard hit us . The sun had set and the sky was clear , but a blizzard is not a sky storm but a ground wind . When a nati ve sees a haze on the ground at a distance , he promptly makes for his cabin and stays there . Fortunately for us , the blizzard blew toward Unalakleet , so , at least. , we were making in the right direction . The wind howled closer and the snow blew about fitfully , at times obscuring all but the wheel dogs . Then we plunged over a bank and hit a lake . It was glare ice , as the snow had all been blown off . Man , dogs and sled are at the mercy of the wind on glare ice , as it is impossible to steer . The poor dogs could get no traction . Bill was crawling on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , toppled over on his side and stayed there . A sudden gust and over went , the sled . " If you lose your sled in the North , you lose your life , " came back Father Mac 's warning , and I hung on desperately . An Ill Wind Blows Us Good There was nothing to do . The wind was doing it . all . The ice was unbroken , so we were all being blown along smoothly , though helplessly . The dogs ' howls of fright , could be heard above the blizzard 's roar as one after another was blown over and carried along struggling in a tangle of harness . I must have been the most ridiculous figure of all . My heavy furs prevented me from rising as I grimly held on to the sled and blew across that three miles of glare ice in as dignified a manner as possible on the seat of my pants . I was not so much worried about the ice trip as the end of it . If the shore of the lake was rocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably wreck the sled and possibly maim or kill a few dogs . Then came a sudden stop . We had been blown into a snowdrift . The sled rolled over again , but suffered no real injury . Daisy had rolled clear of her harness , while Snookum was so tangled in his that he couldn't. move at . all . The middle dogs had n't fared so badly ; but every time the sled had turned over , Katmai and Bill , the wheel dogs , had been rolled over too . They were not , hurt. , but their dispositions were ruffled . Bill thought Katmai was to blame , and began to tell him so . Katmai used a little strong dog language . Bill got Katmai by the neck , and I thought , he would shake him in two before I could jump in and pry him loose . Katmai was just . getting warmed up , and the way he went at Bill was certainly not , like a dog who had just , finished pulling a sled for forty miles . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with the violence of the storm abating , we made Una.lakleet safely that night . At last I was on the Bering Sea . The blizzard that blew us there had drifted the snow until most of the houses were covered to their roof tops , and tunnels had to be dug to every front door . A furred Eskimo loomed into sight as I held my dogs , undecided where to go . I tried him on the only Innuit I knew . " Nanni Torn Moore ( Julia ? " I asked . He grunted in reply and pointed to the old sourdough 's cabin , in its day a. rather pretentious roadhouse . " Piura . " I thanked the native . At my word of command Daisy obediently hawed the team to the left and , climbing a few snowdrifts , pulled up at Tom vIoore 's door . He heard his own dogs barking and came out to investigate . Peering over his glasses , the white-haired old man exclaimed , " You are not , the glacier priest , are you ? Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to warm you up . " " No , " I replied politely , " I must care for my dogs first . " A veteran mail-team driver himself , Tom Moore was pleased at my solicitude for my dogs and showed me the way to the rows of dog stalls . I always put the females to rest first .. As Father Mac had said , they were the best pullers , but tired out . the quickest . At the end of a day 's run , when I chained them up , they curled up on the hay , asleep almost before I could snap the chain . I put . Nancy in the corner stall and Daisy at the opposite end . The only way to keep Snookum from fighting was to chain him in a stall with lady apartments on either side , so Margie and Nancy made the old wolf behave . Pugnacious Pete , his ears bobbed from many a fight , disliked only Snookum ; so , as long as these two were separated , there was comparative peace in my dogdom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole pack , was the five-o'clock whistle , and let the whole world know about it if I was ever late with the dried fish . He became my special pet in a peculiar way . When you feed Alaskan dogs you have to be very careful . It is a business proposition with them and they do n't want to be bothered with etiquette . If you delicately hand a wolf dog his dried fish , you are liable to lose half your hand in the operation ; consequently , you must forward-pass the fish to him , being careful that his neighbor does not intercept and run for a touchdown . I wanted Katmai to become tame , so I handed him his fish one day . He did not snap at my hand , but let out a growl when I did not let . go fast enough . I slapped his nose , gave him a talking to and left him in displeasure . Toward evening I walked to the stalls . Standing out of his stall , Katmai was waving his big fox-brush tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He evidently had something very important to tell me . He greeted me effusively and then turned like a flash into his stall and came out with a bit of dried fish in his mouth . This he set gently at my feet and looked up at me with his big brown eyes , seeming to say most apologetically , " That was a very unfortunate mistake  --  my growling at you . Here is this piece of fish to show you that I did not mean it . " Dining on a Seal Sundae " That , is a fine-looking team you have , " said Tom . " Come on in and get warm . " A motley crowd of Eskimos gazed wonderingly at me as I was ushered to the table . A steaming cup of tea was poured out , and then a bowl of peculiar-looking substance was pushed toward me . " Eskimo ice cream , " explained Tom Moore , " and made especially for the occasion . " I noted a twinkle in the old man 's eyes as I helped myself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man must have a strong head , a strong stomach and a weak nose if he expects to survive in Alaska . It was cold like ice cream , and slid down one 's throat very graciously . It tasted like castor oil and smelled with an odor all its own , but it had food value . I found out that it was made of liberal quantities of seal oil and reindeer fat beaten to a froth and mixed with some sort of swamp grass and then set outside to freeze . Seal sundae would have been a more appropriate title . The mail team from St. Michael came in the next morning , and with it a wonderful Eskimo named Ivan Sipiri , who was to guide me across the treach-erous ice of Norton Sound to St. Michael Island , and thence to the south mouth of the Yukon , Akulurak , on the Bering Sea . Father MeElmeel had warned me that mushing on the coast was as differ-ent from mushing in the interior as auto-mobile driving is from aeroplane fly-ing , and that I should make no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing Ivan did was to go to the school-master 's workshop and replace my hick-ory sled runners with iron . Then he sized up my clothing and said that I 'd better exchange my woolen , fie 42 ) Mary for fur . tooEskimeasurements , and her deft needlework 42 THE SilTURDAY EVENING POST February 13,1932 soon resulted in a comfortably fitting pair of reindeer pants . I felt warm . for the first time that winter . A pairof Lapp reindeer boots filled with hay insured warmth to my feet , and with the fur parka given me by Father McElmeel , I felt . ready to fight the Bering Sea at its worst .. The only trouble was that my dogs did nut appreciate my change in styles . One after another they sniffed a bit too appetizingly at my reindeer pants . It went . altogether too far when I got too close to Snookum just around feeding time . He thought a reindeer was behind my new pants . It was I , though , and the nip he took at me necessitated my having a thorough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had his teeth marks in black and blue for several days . One has to follow the shore line from Unalakleet to St. Michael , watching the sweat b er very closely , before making dash across the ice . The Bering Sea freezes for miles , and tide and wind break up the ice into blocks and pile it . up into cities of glinting minarets and towers that are very hard on sled travel . Often a heavy wind detaches a few square miles of ice from the shore , and dog teams have floated out to sea . to spend several days of terror and near starvation before a change of wind has blown them back again . I could not bear the thought of having to subsist on my own dogs in such an emergency . Snookum would be too tough , and would n't have the heart to try any of the others . Sure Cure for Fatigue With the Eskimo 's instinct for weather , Ivan chose an appropriate day , and we made the long run in safety . Margie was the only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very proper little lady , and I hated to put her up in the swing paired with such an old scoundrel as Snookum . The dogs had settled into a. fine , steady trot as the iron runners crunched over the wind-swept ice . Snookum , the best puller on the team , with his peculiar wolf lope , was putting every ounce of strength in his work and his tail line was as taut as a bowstring . Something was wrong , though . The old wolf was evidently making insinuations of an untoward nature and using language unfit for ladies to hear . Suddenly Margie bared her fangs , gave a. leap across the towline and ripped Snookum 's cheek open .. He probably got what he deserved , but the surprise caused him to slop short , and Pugnacious Pete saw his chance . He leaped on Snookum 's back , and they had a. glorious fight for a few seconds before Ivan and I ran in and stopped it . Most dogs " see " with their noses , but Margie had unusually keen eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead . The rest or the team caught the excitement . and began to sniff eagerly . A huge Arctic owl was perched on an ice block , and stretched his wings and started to fly off . The dogs , led by Margie , galloped i.n pursuit . The sled rocked and skidded and turned as Ivan and I tried to halt the wild run , and every moment a jagged point of ice threatened to tear the sled apart . Ivan was hanging on the front of the sled as I pressed both feet on the brake without effect . I slipped off suddenly and hung on desperately , being dragged along behind the sled . Pulling myself up as best . I could , I tried to work my leg around to kneel on the runner in that wild dash . In doing so my knee collided with an upright block of ice . There was a dull crack and I felt faint and sick . For all the world it sounded like a broken hone ! I did n't even dare move my leg to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then I cautiously moved my foot . What a relief ! It was the ice that had cracked , not my knee . The white owl soon outdistanced the dogs and the mad rush ended . Tired dogs always forget they are tired when they see game . Ivan 's wife , beautiful little Maggie , with her youngest. , Theresa , strapped to her back , met. us at St .. Michael . She busied around and prepared one of the finest meals I ever ate  --  homemade bread , potatoes , reindeer roast , and a fine chocolate cake and canned peaches for dessert .. Two Days ' Travel in One A certain type of explorer likes to paint the Eskimos as filthy , degenerate , and lacking all refinements of civilization . My only reaction is that people who are looking for such characteristics can always find them anywhere they go . I have found the Eskimos , as a race , peaceful , generous , quick to learn , and with a contentment superior to our restless civilization . Ivan hitched up his team to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey away . Dog teams are extremely jealous on the trail . It takes a good team to keep ahead . Even though pulling a heavier load , the dogs behind have the advantage . They keep straining to catch the team i.n front , while the dogs in front are always looking around to see how fast the second team is coming . On my own team , Katmai and Warrior would yell and leap and almost snap their tail lines . It took every ounce of strength to hold them in . The guiding team is usually allowed to get ahead until it is out of sight . From St .. Michael to Cheneleak is sixty-seven miles ; usually made in two days . By mid-day we made Point R.omanof and looked out over the silent , stretches of the ice-bound Bering Sea . A lone cabin , entirely drifted in with snow , was built on the point as a shelter . Storms are fatal when they catch a dog musher in this lonely stretch , and many a team has holed up in the cabin for days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it would hold , the dogs were not tired , so we decided to risk the dash over the ice to make Cheneleak in one day 's run . This was a. real test of dog power . Ivan plunged his clogs over the point . I held my foot . on the brake and waited until he became a speck in the distance before letting my team gallop in pursuit . The sun dipped far to the north and stayed long on the horizon , a. blood-red disk . Pat , pat. , pat , pat went the feet as every dog pulled strongly . They were racing directly into the disk of the setting sun , and as the roseate ice turned to purple , the full spell of the magic north took hold of us all . " Nice work , Nancy ! Dear old Princie ! Snookum , you wolf ! Keep it up , Katmai ! Warrior , Pete , Bill , Daisy , Margie ! " You never travel silent on your sled . You sing and whistle , and keep up a continual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserve it . ? Twenty-five miles a day with a heavy load is good mushing . Thirty-five miles is made consistently only by the best mail teams . I was asking my stalwarts for sixty-seven on this day , and they were giving it . I could never have done it alone . Alone I was as far as human companionship was concerned , but I knew that somewhere ahead in the gathering gloom Ivan was guiding me , with uncanny instinct for direction. , to the one spot on the distant shore line where there was a village and shelter . AlSo little Daisy , my Siberian dog leader , knew how to follow a trail unerringly . Katmai was my real leader over country where there was no trail and where courage and energy were needed , but his power on this trip was used to best advantage at the wheel . By day the dogs get tired and hot. , and occasional rests are needed . At night. , though , they begin to freshen up and appear tireless . Perhaps it is the wolf that comes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are part of the pack going to their kill . It soon grew dark , but it . was clear and the myriad diamonds of heaven twinkled overhead , while a few streamers of the Northern Lights added their magic to the Arctic . night .. I could barely make out the bobbing , shadowy shapes of my dogs , but could feel them pulling strongly . That ride was the most enjoyable of the whole winter as we pulled in to Cheneleak at ten o'clock . We bedded the dogs down comfortably , gave them an extra-good feed , and Ivan and I crawled into our sleeping bags and slept soundly on the floor of the little mission chapel . I had intended to say Mass , as usual , quietly by myself , very early in the morning . Somehow word had passed around among the Eskimos that the glacier priest . was there . Where they all came from , I do not know , but next morning the little chapel was packed to standing room by the devout children of the north , who , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Innuit and in Latin sang some of the finest Gregorian chant I ever heard , even in a cathedral of Europe . Pete and Snookum Have Words Akulurak , the farthest-flung of the Alaskan missions , was reached , and as it was close to Easter week , I determined to lie over and give the dogs a good rest before starting the grueling trip back up the Yukon to Holy Cross , the end of my sixteen-hundred-mile dog mush . The dreaded spring thaws might . come at any time , and man and dog had to be in the best possible shape . One night toward full moon I heard an unusual commotion and , slipping on my parka and seal boots , went out .. Probably a clog was loose and had to be tied up . I counted the posts and all were there . " What 's the matter with . you fellows ? " I growled , coming closer . Pete and Snookum were crouching and facing each other . Pete was cursing Snookum back to his most remote ancestry , and Snook-um was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog language in my life . " Come and get , it. , you blankety old four-flusher ! " Pete snarled at Snookum . " Give me a chance ! " rumbled Snookum , straining the full length of his chain . This time it was Pete 's fault . He had n't had a decent fight for several days and craved action . So what did he do but save a little piece of his evening meal of fish , and , setting it down , crouch over it and dare the rest of the team to take it away from him ? Naturally , over this bone  --  or rather fish  --  of contention the whole team got roused up ; especially Snookum , who liked eating and fighting equally well . They would wrangle all night if I let . them alone , so 44 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST February 13,1932 I took the fish away from Pete and scolded him . The lovable old fighter licked my hand affectionately and curled up to sleep . The next , day when . I fed them I stayed around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all except a little piece , and settingit down started his chip-on-the-shoulder taunting again . This time he lost out . Pete was a twoyear-old , Snookum was a few years his senior and knew a trick or two more . Snookum went out the length of his chain toward Pete , and unmindful of Pete 's varied taunts tried to stretch his paw out to the coveted fish . He could n't reach it by inches . Pete 's attention was distracted by Warrior , who was digging a hole in the snow in his efforts to get closer to Pete . As quick as a flash , when Pete 's head was turned , Snookum wheeled around in a tail-spin shift that would excite envy in the most successful exponent of the Notre Dame system , and with the longer reach of his hind leg hooked in Pete 's fish . Pete sprang to the rescue too late and his wild howls and dashes worked him up to a frenzy . The Dogs Get a Manicure When I said my last good-by to those Eskimo children , big tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashamed to say that I swallowed hard myself as I snapped the whip and plunged over the river bank to start the last . lap of the long mush . It is not . very practical to get sentimental in zero weather . The tears freeze on your cheeks and your eyelashes stick together and make an awful mess . Going - up the river the weather became thick , and I was glad I had good Joseph Afgan , an Eskimo guide , to direct me through the drifting landscape . With one overnight . stop at an Eskimo village , we made Andreafsky the next day . Here I found confirmation of rumors that the flu was raging along the Yukon . This deadly plague gets a hold on the country every few years and takes a terrible toll of death in the native villages . After a day 's visit . with Father Cunningham , I pushed on to Pilot Station . Next day I made the stricken area , and it was pitiful . Many were dead , and the living too sick and weak to bury them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pushed on . Finally I made Marshall , a mining town , just in time to follow the tracks of the last mail team of the year to go upriver . By this time I knew I had the flu myself . I had never been sick before in Alaska and here was a case of keeping going or I did not like to imagine the alternative . Eric Johnson , the big United States marshal , of Marshall , tried to persuade me to remain as his guest and get rid of the flu . I felt , though , that I must push on to Holy Cross . Eric then looked my sled over to see that it was in good shape for the upriver trip and gave me a pointer on caring for my dogs ' feet . Gripping in loose snow , the toenails become long and clawlike . With the advent of longer days much of the snow melts . Long toenails are apt to get caught in the frozen ground and snap off , with the possibility of putting a dog out of commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the dogs , to the curiousinterest of some and the violent protest of others . Eric also looked over my dog moccasins , used when traveling over spike ice , and pronounced them . fit . It was a blinding hot day when I left Marshall , and the sled runners crashed through the softened crust of icy snow , making hard pulling . Sand bars appeared black and bare along the trail , and it required every ounce of strength of dogs and driver to make any headway . Water flowed along the sides of the Yukon and a course had to be steered along the buoyed-up ice in the center of the channel . At midday we were all exhausted and had to lie up until evening for the freeze-up that made travel possible . A portage through the woods cut off several miles of river , so I urged the dogs along the snowy path between the trees . I had been warned that the portage ended in a steep , dangerous plunge over the river bank at Pitka 's Point , but was totally unprepared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two hundred feet almost straight down lay the Yukon ice . The sun had melted the protecting snow away and it was impossible to guide the sled . I jammed the brake on as the dogs catapulted over the edge . It did not hold and the heavy sled threatened destruction to the fleeing dogs . Right in the middle of the pitch that we were taking at dizzy speed a tree stump loomed up . It was impossible to avoid , and hitting it meant . wrecking the sled . It was up to Katmai . " Gee , Katmai ! " I yelled despairingly . The magnificent , wheel dog sensed danger and responded in a way I never heard of before . Only the leader responds to " Gee " and " Haw , " and here I was expecting it from a puller . But Katmai did not . fail . With a strong lead he cleared the towline and bumped Bill right off his feet . The weight . of the two heavy dogs swerved the front of the sled to the right ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sled hurtled down with only a few side lashings scraped off . We hit the ice still upright . and then sled and dogs and I rolled over . I had a cut in my head , Bill showed blood on his side and Katmai had strained a leg , but nobody was seriously hurt . A Free.for , AIL in an ice Hole The flu had taken hold of me by this time and nothing seemed to matter much . " If you lose your sled in the North , you lose your life , " I half sobbed to the dogs and went . on . It was a long run that day and the dogs began to show signs of strain . It was zero hour for - us all . Then Daisy , an ideal leader all along , made a mistake . She suddenly left the river trail before I could stop her and started straight up the bank . The first . thing I knew I was looking at my dogs strung out almost straight . over me . " Gee , around , Daisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of swinging the team in a curve , jackknifed them . She pulled Snookum back against Pete , and that was all that was necessary . They started to fight savagely . To make matters worse , the sled began to slide backward over the slick ice . It gained momentum and sled , dogs and I all fell into an ice hole . That was the worst mess I was in all winter . The dogs were all piled up in the hole , tangled in their harness , slipping , fighting and making a hideous racket . Some were locked in a death grapple , and I swung the blacksnake until my arm refused to respond , and still . I could not stop them . Fighting dogs were all over me . Sometimes I was under them , sometimes I walked on them , struggling to get out of the ice hole and always slipping hack . The harness soon became so tangled up that , one by one , the dogs had to stop fighting from sheer lack of freedom of movement . I climbed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snookum was looking up at me . His face was all bloody , one front paw was held fast through Margie 's collar , and both hind legs were tangled in Pete 's harness , who was lying motionless under him . The only part of Snookum that was free was his tail ; and the old wolf VMS wagging- that vigorously , as much as to say , " Now , was n't that , a wonderful fight ! " Daisy , the cause of it all , had pulled completely out of her harness and was sitting down on the river bank about fifty feet away ! Poor Katmai was mad all through , and rah-raking plaintively . He hadn't. been in the fight at all , and had not even got in one bite  --  and every good Malemute is allowed at least one bite in a general fight ! In the tumble into the ice hole , Katmai was held down by the sled , and somehow or other had got both his front legs looped in his neck line so effectively as to keep him securely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour to straighten out the tangle , reharness the team and get going again . I was very weak . My lungs felt . tight , my face was burned and cracked until it was unrecognizable , and I was a long way from Holy Cross . Still , the merciful cold froze up everything at night , and the spring thaws delayed their death march . When the thermometer rises well above freezing and stays there , the lower Yukon becomes a floating hell of water , and to be caught out in a dog team is death . Pink Elephants of the Arctic I have no very clear recollection of the places where I stayed or the people I met on that last hundred miles , but one day I left the river to climb up the bank on a portage . A native boy was ahead . It was the mail team I was chasing , and my dogs , averaging fifty miles a day , bad caught it . The driver told me Holy Cross was just around the bend . Half delirious with joy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissing them and telling them we had beat . the spring thaws to Holy Cross . The mission buildings soon came into sight . White-bearded , white-haired old Father Lucchesi , veteran missionary of the North , came out of the house to meet me . " Welcome , " he said . " Come in . You look spent . Let the boys take your dogs to the barn . " " If I lose my sled , I lose my life , " I muttered . " Gee , Daisy " ? and I insisted on putting my own dogs away . After all , I was not entirely responsible . I was sick . All I could see were strange faces bobbing around that at times looked like pink elephants and Kodiak bears . One with the headdress of the Sisters of St. Ann seemed kindly , and I was prevailed to follow her to the hospital . She was Sister Epiphane , the trained nurse . She plastered me up with antiphlogistin mud and off I went to bed . Eleven died at Holy Cross of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three days after my arrival the spring thaws came and the whole country became water . My dogs had pulled me through sixteen hundred miles , and my proudest boast is that in spite of everything I did n't lose or maim a single dog . Can you blame anyone for loving Alaskan dogs ?
