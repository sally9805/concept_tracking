Opened at Manhattan 's American Museum of Natural History last week was an exhibit unique among the world 's museums . It was as if groups of animals , feeding , drinking , hunting , traveling or resting in Africa , had been immobilized by some mighty power and transported in their natural surroundings across the Atlantic to the Akeley Memorial Hall of African Mammals . Passing through the new Roosevelt Memorial visitors entered a vast room of black and grey marble , dimly illuminated from overhead by a light like dusk in the jungle . Around the sides of the hall were 15 reconstructions of animal life . On these shone a light like hot sunshine . <P> In the damp uplands of the Belgian Congo a glowering male gorilla beats his breast , while the female leans placidly against a tree , watching her baby eat wild celery . At a waterhole a mother giraffe with widespread forelegs is bending down to drink . Beside her are the male , keeping watch , and the calf . Nearby a young Grvy 's zebra is suckling its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep cliff . On the plains of Tanganyika a group of mottled , sinister-looking wild dogs are intently watching a herd of zebra , ready to give chase and cut down a straggler . There is a group of five lions , including a superb black-maned male . Four giant sable antelopes are resting in a copse of acacia trees . A pair of Bongo antelopes are pushing into a bamboo jungle , disturbing a forest hog which heaves up from its bed among ferns and orchids . <P> In the centre of the hall , looming up in the dim light , is a group of eight big-eared elephants . They have no setting , give an overpowering impression of tons of monstrous life on the move . One enormous bull raises his trunk horizontally as a danger signal . The bull at the rear wheels around to make sure no enemy is following . Four of these beasts were shot by the museum 's President Frederick Trubee Davison ( TIME , Aug. 14 ; Sept. n , 1933 ) . The other four were bagged by the late Carl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals , a man of dreams and obsessions , a lover of Africa , a skilled and inventive craftsman . At 15 he quit work on his father 's farm , sent out cards reading , " Artistic taxidermy in all its branches . " He thought stuffed animals were ridiculous , inaugurated the practice of making a sculptured model , faithful in every muscle , curve and hollow , stretching the skin over it . He made his first trip to Africa in 1896 . He saw then that little of the real Africa could be conveyed by stiff specimens without backgrounds , or by frayed and disconsolate animals in a zoo , and conceived the idea which came to fruition last week when the hall bearing his name was opened . <P> Carl Akeley was never afraid to get close to his animals . Once he was clawed by a leopard . On another occasion , while studying a herd of elephants , he was suddenly charged by a bull . His gun jammed . Akeley seized the tusks of the oncoming beast , swung himself between them so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With its trunk the elephant smashed the explorer 's nose , laid open his cheek , broke several ribs which punctured his lungs , then was distracted by the native boys and gave chase . During a three-month convalescence in a hospital , Akeley planned all the details of his African hall .
