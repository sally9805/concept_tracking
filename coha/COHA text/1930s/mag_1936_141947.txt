Nine years ago when trailers were a rarity , residents of the six New England States began observing on their highways an odd vehicle , no trailer but a house car , its sides as neatly clapboarded as a village church . It was a church , complete with folding pulpit and collapsible organ , built by a New Hampshire toy manufacturer for a Baptist minister named Herbert R. Whitelock . With his motherly wife Edith Sisson Whitelock , this man of God had spent many a summer preaching in parks , factories , on street corners and village greens . <P> Beginning this week , Preacher Whitelock planned to pack his wife and belongings in what he calls " the Chassis Church , " take to the road for good . After a tour of northern New England the Whitelocks will head for the paradise of trailer folk , Florida . There they will put to full use a technique which has earned them some fame broadcasting as " Uncle Herb and Aunt Ede " over small New England radio stations .

" Embarking last week on their new venture , Mr. Whitelock declared : " We 're starting on faith alone . No one with a lot of money is backing us . What does it say in the Bible-Carry neither purse , nor scrip ? Churches are necessary , but Christianity is too big to be confined to churches alone . " The church which confined Baptist Whitelock to his itinerant preaching in the summer was Horace Memorial in Chelsea , Mass . Before resigning as its pastor he mounted its pulpit one Sunday last month , began preaching a stock sermon which he continually revises and brings up to date . <P> After 20 minutes , when most preachers would have ceased , Preacher Whitelock was merely warming up to his subject , " Signs of the Times . " When an hour had passed , Mr. Whitelock had no more than established his thesis : that Holy Writ contains prophecies of modern social , moral , financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours had passed , his patient congregation was still listening to quotations dealing with such subjects as heavy motor traffic ( They shall justle one against another in the broad ways . . . . <P> They shall run like the lightnings. - Na- hum , 2 : 4 ) . After two hours and a quarter , Preacher Vhitelock said : " Let us pray . " His listeners professed not to have been bored . To them the service was a notable event , the 13th annual Two-Hour Sermon , which Baptist Whitelock had introduced in Chelsea as a revival from Puritan times. * <P> * Last summer Rector Frederic Sydney Fleming of Manhattan 's rich old Trinity Parish came out for a moratorium on preaching ( TIME , Aug. 17 ) . Fortnight ago the Institute of Public Opinion reported that its opinion samplings show that people are 80% in favor of preaching as it now exists .
