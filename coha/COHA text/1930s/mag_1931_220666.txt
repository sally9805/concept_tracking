A new Dry organization came into being last week . It was called Allied Forces . Its organizer was Dr. Daniel Alfred Poling , head of the World 's Christian Endeavor Union , editor of the Christian Herald and director of the J. C. Penney Foundation . <P> For months lay Drys have been restive under the domination of their cause by such ecclesiastical organizations as the Anti-Saloon League and the W. C. T. U. Muffled complaints were made that clerics were always in high command of Prohibition campaigns , that churches were the only rallying places for the 18th Amendment . To secularize the Dry cause became the purpose of Allied Forces . Dr. Poling called it a " new deal . " Among its sponsors was no long list of churchmen but such names as Thomas Alva Edison , Gifford Pinchot , Jane Addams , Evangeline Booth , Patrick Henry Callahan , Oliver Wayne Stewart , Raymond Robins , William Gibbs McAdoo , Orrin R. Judd . <P> The organization is divided into four groups : 1 ) Allied Youth ; 2 ) Allied Businessmen ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
