LETTERS or FANNY BRAWNE TO FANNY KEATS-Edited by Fred Edgcumbe- Oxford University Press ( $3 ) . <P> When John Keats died of consumption in Italy ( 1821 ) at the age of 26 , he left two girls behind him . Both were named Fanny . One was his orphan sister , the other was Fanny Brawne , to whom he was engaged . Keats 's letters to Fanny Brawne are classics in love-letter literature ; hers to him were buried with him . In spite of such kind words as Amy Lowell 's ( John Keats , Fanny Brawne has generally figured in Keats 's story as a light-headed minx who failed to appreciate him . Last week 31 letters of Fanny Brawne to Fanny Keats were published for the . first time . <P> In his preface , Maurice Buxton Forman thought their evidence should at last lay the legend of Fanny Brawne 's heartlessness , establish her as the worthy sweetheart of a great poet . Lay readers could not see that , short of reading between the lines with a very sympathetic eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . <P> Fanny Brawne wrote her first letter to Fanny Keats a few days after she had said her last farewell to John . The last one was written four years later , when Fanny Keats had come of age , escaped from the restrictions of her foster parents and could meet her friends at will . The two girls had never met when they began their correspondence ; Fanny 's first letter is on the formal side . But soon they were chattering away intimately about clothes , books and callers , sending each other patterns , discussing mutual friends and enemies . At first Fanny 's references to their greatest mutual interest , John , are very guarded . Not until after his death does she say in so many words that they were to be married : " Had he returned I should have been his wife and he would have lived with us . " And she breaks out : " It is now known that his recovery was impossible before he left us , and he might have died here with so many friends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months later she writes : " I have not got over it and never shall-It 's better for me that I should not forget him but not for you , you have other things to look forward to . " After that the references to John are increasingly few and far between . <P> Fanny 's letters never mention what she really thought of her lover 's poetry , though on other literary subjects she is quite frank : " I go on as usual , reading every trumpery novel that comes in my way spoiling my taste and understanding . . . . " -A passage on Byron is almost a giveaway : " Do n't you or do you admire Don Juan ? perhaps you like the serious parts best but I have been credibly informed that Lord B. is not really a great poet , have taken a sort of dislike to him when serious and only adore him for his wit and humour . I am by no means a great poetry reader . . . . " Later it comes out that " as my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people do , it soon lost its value for me . " <P> Both Fannies married . Fanny Keats , five years after her brother 's death , was first . She married a Spaniard , one Valentine Llanos , settled in Spain . Fanny Brawne followed suit when she was 33 and her grief for John was 12 years old . As Mrs. Louis Lindon she became the mother of three , a tranquil matron ; she lived to a ripe old age .
