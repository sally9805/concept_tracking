GAL YOUNG UN A STORY IN TWO PARTS PART II BY MARJORIE KINNAN RAWLINGS A WARM winter rain thrummed on the roof . The light rush of water sank muffled into the moss that padded the shingles . The sharpest sound was a gurgling in the gutter over the rain-barrel . There had been no visible rising of the sun . Only the gray daylight had protracted itself , so that it was no longer dawn , but day . Matt sat close to the kitchen stove , her bulk shadowy in the dimness . Now and then she opened the door of the fire-box to push in a stick of pine , and the light of the flames flickered over her drawn face . She could not tell how much of the night she had sat crouched by the range . She had lain long hours unsleeping , while Trax breathed regularly beside her . When the rain began , she left the bed and dressed by the fresh-kindled fire . The heat did not warm her . Her mouth was dry ; yet every few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to walk up the unused stairs , down the dusty hall to the back room with the rough pine bed in it , to open the door and look in , to see if anyone was there . Yet if she continued to sit by the fire , moving back the coffee pot when it boiled , surely Trax would come to the kitchen alone , and she would know that yesterday no woman had come home with him . Through the long days her distraught mind had been busy with imaginings . They might easily have materialized , for a moment , in a painted girl , small and very young , in blue kid slippers . Trax was moving about . She put the frying pan on the stove , sliced bacon into it , stirred up cornmeal into a pone with soda and salt and water . Trax called someone . He came into the kitchen , warmed his hands at the stove . He poured water into the wash basin and soused his face in it . Matt set the coffee pot on the table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came through . She came to the table uncertainly as though she expected to be ordered away . Matt did not speak . Trax said , " How 's my gal ? " The girl brought her wide eyes to him and took a few steps to his chair . " Where your shoes , honey ? " She looked down at her stockinged feet . " I got ta be keerful of ' em . " He laughed indulgently . " You kin have more when them 's gone . Matt , give the young un some-thin ' to cat . " The thought struck the woman like the warning whir of a rattler that if she looked at the girl in this moment she would be compelled to lift her in her hands and drop her like a scorpion on the hot stove . She thought , " I cai n't do sick as that . " She kept her back turned until the impulse passed and she could control her trembling . Her body was of metal and wood . It moved of itself , in jerks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed immovable . Her stomach weighed her down . Her ample breasts hurt her ribs , as though they were of lead . She thought , " I got to settle this now . " She said aloud slowly , " I 'll not wait on her , nor no other woman . " The girl twisted one foot over the other . She said , " I ai n't hungry . " Trax stood up . His mouth was thin . He said to Matt , " You 'll wait on her , old lady , or you 'll git along without my comp'ny . " She thought , " I got to settle it . I got to say it . " But she could not speak . The girl repeated eagerly , " I ai n't a hit hungry . " Trax picked up a plate from the table . He held it out to his wife . She thought , " Anyway , cornbread an ' bacon 's got nothin ' to do with it . " She dished out meat and bread . Trax held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man sat down complacently . The girl sat beside him and pecked at the food . Her eyes were lowered . Between mouthfuls , she twisted her fingers in her lap or leaned over to inspect her unshod feet . Matt thought , " Remindin ' me . " The paint had been rubbed from the round face . The hair was yellow , like allamanda blooms . The artificial curls that had protruded from the pert hat had flattened out during the damp night , and hung in loose waves on the slim neck . She wore the blue silk dress in which she had arrived . Trax said , " You eat up good , Elly . May be night ' fore we git hack to eat agin . " He turned to Matt . " Lantry boys been doin ' all right ? " " They been doin ' all right . Them 's good boys . I heerd ' em come in a hour back . But they needs watchin ' right on . They 'll let the mash go too long , spite of everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em . " She hardened herself . " You jest as good to stay home an ' do the work yourself . I ai n't goin ' near the outfit . " " They kin make out by theirselves , " he said easily . He rose from the table , picking his teeth . " Come on , Elly . " The girl turned her large eyes to the older woman , as though she were the logical recipient of her confession . " I forgot to wash my hands an ' face , " she said . Trax spoke curtly . " Well , do it now , an ' be quick . " He poured warm water in the basin for her and stood behind her , waiting . She washed slowly , with neat , small motions , like a cat . Trax handed her the clean end of the towel . They went upstairs together . Trax ' voice was low and muffled . It dripped through the ceiling like thick syrup . Suddenly Matt heard the girl laugh . She thought , " I figgered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant it to . " In a few minutes they came down again . Trax called from the front room . " Best to cook dinner to-night , Matt . We 're like not to git back at noon . " They ran from the porch through the rain . She walked after them . She was in time to see them step in the blue sedan . The high-heeled slippers flickered across the running-board . The car roared through the Iive oaks , down the tracks among the pines . Matt closed her eyes against the sight of it . She thought , " Maybe she takened her satchel an ' I jest did n't see it . Maybe she ai n't comin ' back . " GAL YOUNG UN 2,2,7 She forced herself to go to the upstairs bedroom . The drumming on the roof sounded close and louder . The bed was awkwardly made . The shabby handbag stood open in a hickory rocker , exposing its sparse contents . A sound startled her . The cat had followed , and was sniffing the unfamiliar garments in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were alone together in the house , desolate and lonely in the rain-drenched flat-woods . She thought of the Lantry boys under the palmettos . They were careless when they were cold and wet . They might not put the last five hundred pounds of sugar under cover . Shivering in the drizzle , they might use muddy water from the bank of the branch , instead of going a few yards upstream where it ran deep and clear . She threw Trax ' corduroy jacket about her and went down the incline behind the house to oversee the work . She had decided not to cook anything for the evening . But when the mist lifted in late afternoon , and the sun struck slantwise through the wet dark trees , she left the Lantry boys to finish and went to the house . She fried ham and baked soda biscuits and sweet potatoes . The meal was ready and waiting and she stirred up a quick ginger cake and put it in the oven . She said aloud , desperately , " Might be he 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare house into its loneliness , as she had gathered the cat , and she lighted kerosene lamps in the long front room and a fire , the man and girl came together as she had known they would . Where she had felt only despair , suddenly she was able to hate . She picked up her anger like a stone and hurled it after the blue heels . " Go eat your dinner . " She spoke to them as she would to negro field hands . Trax stared at her . He herded Elly nervously ahead of him , as though to protect her from an obscure violence . Matt watched them , standing solidly on big feet . She had not been whole . She had charred herself against the man 's youth and beauty . Her hate was healthful . It waked her from a drugged sleep , and she stirred faculties hurt and long unused . She sat by the clay fireplace in the front room while the pair ate . They spoke in whispers , shot through by the sudden laugh of the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one note of the thrush . Hearing it , Matt twisted her mouth . When the casual clatter of plates subsided , she went to the kitchen and began scraping the dishes to wash them . Trax sat warily in his place . The girl made an effort to hand Matt odds and ends from the table . The woman ignored her . Trax said to Elly , " Le 's go by the fire . " Matt cleaned up the kitchen and fed the cat . She stroked its arching back as it chewed sideways on scraps of meat and potato . She took off her apron , listened at the open door for sounds from the Lantrys , bolted the door , and walked to the front room to sit stiff and defiant by the blazing pine fire . The girl sat with thin legs tucked under her chair . She looked from the man to the woman and back again . Trax stretched and yawned . He said , " Guess I 'll go down back an ' give the boys a hand . I ai n't any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to keep up my stuff . I got high-class trade . Ai n't I , Elly ? " He touched her face with his finger as he passed her . The woman and the girl sat silently after his going . The cat padded in and sat between them . The girl called timidly . " Kitty ! " Matt turned savagely . " Keep your hands off him . " The girl laced her fingers and studied the animal . " Do he scratch ? " Matt did not answer . She loosened her gray hair and combed it by the fire with a side-comb , plaiting it into two thin braids over her shoulders . Inside the childish hairdressing her face was bony and haggard . She went into the adjoining bedroom , undressed and got into bed . She lay reared up on one elbow , straining for every sound . The fire popped and crackled . Once the juice oozed from a pine log faster than it could burn . It made a sizzling , Iike boiling fat . A chair scraped and Elly went up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Matt thought with satisfaction that the girl had no light . She was floundering around in the dark in the unfamiliar house . In a little while the front door opened and closed softly . Matt heard Trax creak cautiously up the stairs to the back room . Trax was sleeping away the bright March morning . Matt made no effort to he silent about her washing . She dipped noisily into the rain barrel . When the soft water was gone she drew from the well , rattling galvanized buckets . Elly sat on the bottom step of the rear stoop , scuffling her bare toes in the sand . She wore the blue silk dress . Beside her was a handful of her own garments in need of washing , a pair of silk stockings and two or three pieces of underwear . Matt passed in front of her to go to the clothes line . Elly said , " Trax give me this dress . " The woman did not seem to hear her . Elly continued . " Reckon it 'll wash ? It 's spotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towels on the line . The girl picked up her small pile , lookeduncertainly at the tub of soapsuds , laid down the clothes . She went to the tub and began rubbing on the first garment she drew from the suds . It was one of Matt 's gingham aprons . She rubbed with energy , and Matt towered over her before she noticed that the woman had left the line . " Take your dirty hands out o ' my tub . " The girl drew back , dripping suds from her thin arms . She turned her hands back and forth . " They ai n't dirty , " she protested . Matt laughed shortly . " Mighty simple , ai n't you ? " An obscure doubt brushed her , like a dove that wavers to a perch and is gone again without lighting . " Who do you figger I am ? " The girl faced her across the washtub . She said gravely , " The lady lives in Trax ' house . " " Trax ' house ? Well , he lives in mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife , eh ? " The girl hesitated . " Trax jest said the old woman . " Matt breathed heavily . The girl took her silence and her questions for a mark of interest . " Trax said you 'd romp on me , " she offered confidentially , " but you ai n't . " She wrapped one bare leg around the other . " I been romped on , " she went on brightly . Pa romped on me reg ' - lar . " " You got you folks then ! " " Yessum , but I do n't know where he is . He run a blacksmith shop an ' garage offen the hard road , but he closed up an ' goed to Georgia with a lady . Then I lived with another lady down the road a piece . Trax sold her liquor , that 's how come him to know me . She moved off , an ' he takened me with him from there . Now I 'm gon na live with him , " she finished , adding with studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rear GAL YOUNG UN 2t9 stoop in time to see Matt walk toward the girl . Elly stared uncomprehending . He jumped to the sand and caught the woman 's muscular arms from behind . " Do n't you touch her . " He cracked his familiar whip over her . " You hurt that gal young un an ' you 've seed the last o ' me . " The woman shook free from him in the strength of her rage . " You git out o ' here before I hurts her an ' you , too . You take yer gal young un an ' git . " He adjusted his mind slowly . Inconceivably , he had gone too far . Bringing the girl to the flat-woods had been dangerously brazen . It was done now . He understood that his hold on this place had become suddenly precarious . He had the car and he could move the still . Yet the lay-out suited his needs too exactly to be relinquished . He could not give it up . If the gray-headed woman was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said boldly , " I got no idee o ' goin ' . Me an ' Elly 'll be here right on .

An ' if you hurt Elly " ? his dark face nodded at her ? " if you crack down on her  --  with them big hands o ' yournif you got any notion o ' knifin ' " ? he paused for emphasis ? " I 'll git you sent to the chair , or up fer life  --  an ' I 'll be here in these flat-woods  --  in this house ? right on . " He pushed the girl ahead of him and walked into the house , lighting a cigarette . He said over his shoulder , thickly between puffs , " An ' that 'd suit me jest fine . " She turned blindly to the wash-tub . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down automatically . Her life that had runlike the flat-woods road , straight and untraveled , was now a maze , doubling back on itself darkly , twisted with confusion . The man stood with his neat trap at the end of every path ; the girl with her yellow hair and big eyes , at the beginning . She thought , " I got to settle it . " Trax and Elly came and went like a pair of bright birds . The blue kid slippers , scuffed by the sand , flashed in and out of the old house . Matt watched the comings and goings heavily , standing solidly on the band-hewn pine-board floors . She did not go near the still . Her absence did not make the difference she had imagined . The Lantrys had the work well in hand . Trax paid their wages , and their product was satisfactory . Often she did not hear them come to their work through the pines and past the hammock . A northwest wind sometimes brought the scent of the mash to her nose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail , and she seldom saw him . Trax was selling all his liquor at a high urban price , and local patronage dwindled away . The woods were quiet day and night . Then Trax and Elly were back again , talking of hotels and highways , of new business , the talk pierced through now and again by the girl 's single-noted laughter . She eyed Matt gravely , but the woman felt that the girl , oddly , had no fear . Trax was insolent , as always , his eyes narrow and his ways wary . Matt cut down on the table . She cooked scarcely enough for the three to eat . Elly ate with her catlike slowness , taking twice as long at her meager plate as the others . Matt took to rising and clearing the table as soon as she and Trax had finished . She picked up the plates casually , as though unaware that the third one still showed half its food uneaten . Trax did not seem to notice . The girl sometimes looked hungrily after the vanishing portion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen between meals , eating cold cornbread . Trax backed her up in her curt order to Elly to keep out . It enraged Matt to see Elly feed the cat . Elly saved bits from her sparse helpings and held them under the table when she thought herself unobserved . Occasionally when the girl held the animal in her lap , and Matt ignored it , Trax stroked him too , because it was Elly who held him . Matt knew they sometimes had food in Elly 's room at night . She began to hear a soft padding up the stairs and on the bare floor overhead , and knew the cat went up to join them . In the morning he was smug , washing his whiskers enigmatically . His desertion was intolerable . She shut him out at night . He wailed for hours at the door , accustomed to sleeping snugly inside the house . Suddenly Trax was not taking Elly with him any more . The village had become accustomed to the grave childish face beside him when it disappeared . Casually he left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away one morning and did not come back that night or the next . Matt took it for a taunt . It seemed to her that he was daring her to trap herself . Elly watched the road anxiously the first day . She accepted , hours before Matt , his solitary departure . At their first breakfast alone together , she said hesitantly ; " I had a idee Trax was fain ' to go off alone . " Matt thought , " The fool do n't know enough to keep quiet about it . " After the second day , Elly devoted herself to exploring outside the house . Trax had kept her close to him , and the hammock had been only a cluster ofshrubs and great trees through which they came and went . The Spanish moss was hazed with green by the early spring , and she discovered that the gray strands were alive with infinitesimal rosy blossoms . Matt saw her sitting at the far edge of the hammock , pulling the stuff apart . The woman thought , " She better git herself out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pines as far as the road , staring up and down its silent winding , then scampered back toward the house like an alarmed squirrel . She walked stealthily to the palmettos where the Lantrys worked the still , and watched them for hours , unseen . Except when Matt stared directly at her , her round-eyed gravity lifted into a certain lightness , as though she felt newly free to move about in the sunlight . She seemed content . On a rainy afternoon Matt , ironing in the kitchen , heard a steady snipping from the front room . She stole to the door and peered through a crack . Elly was cutting pictures from an old magazine and making an arrangement of rooms and figures of men and women and children . She was talking to herself and occasionally to them . The cat was curled in her lap , shifting lazily as she moved forward or back . Their meals together were silent . Matt became aware at dinner one day that the pink oleanders in a jelly glass were not of her picking and placing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . Because Elly had brought in the blooms , she snatched them from the water and stuffed them in the stove . She allowed the girl a minimum of food . Once when she took away the plates before Elly had fairly begun , the girl reached after her desperately and said " Matt ! " Again , when Matt moved from the table , leaving a plate of biscuits behind , Elly pounced on the largest and crammed it into her mouth . GAL YOUNG UN She began to laugh , poking in the crumbs . She said , " You ai n't romped on me yet . " Matt decided that Trax had put Elly up to goading her . She spoke for the first time in days . " Do n't you let Trax put no notions in yore head . I got no idee o ' rompin ' on you . That ai n't what I 'm fixin ' to do . " For the most part , the girl was uncomplaining and strangely satisfied . The immature body , however , was becoming rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for an afternoon and loaded up with twenty gallon-jugs concealed under the large rear seat , and went hurriedly away . He called to the two women who stood watching on the piazza . " Got a order . " Matt nodded grimly after him . She thought , " You got you one more chance , too , if you on'y knowed it . " She turned to observe the girl beside her . There was apparent on the young face a faint wistfulness and no surprise . Matt thought , " She 's got her orders jest to set tight . " Trax came home for the following week-end . He slept most of the time and was sulky . He paid no more attention to Elly than to the older woman . At no time in the two days or nights did he go to the upstairs room . When he was about , Elly followed him a few steps . Then , as he continued to ignore her , she dropped behind and took up her own simple affairs . Matt told herself that if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On Monday morning , after loading , he went alone to the car . She said carelessly , " I might take a notion to go some'eres or do somethin ' . When you comin ' back this time ? " He laughed insolently . " Steppin ' out , Matt ? " He was sure of himself . He was too quick for her . What-ever futilities she was planning , it would surprise her most to return on the day he named . " Be back Sat'day . " He drove off smiling . Matt was nervous all week . On Saturday morning she surprised the Lantry boys by appearing at the still . They had come and gone without contact with her for some weeks . She said , " Boys , I jest got word the Pro-hi 's is comin ' fer Trax ' outfit . Now I ai n't quick as you-all , an ' I want each one o ' you should go down the road a good piece an ' stay there all day , watchin ' , one to the north an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ' if I bears a whistle I 'll know what it means an ' it 'll give me time to smash the jugs an ' git to the house . " The boys were in instant alarm . " Must be somebody 's turned Trax up , " they said . Matt said , " Mighty likely . Somebody 's likely got it in fer him . Trax hisself done tole me a long ways back , if anybody had it in fer a man , that was the way they 'd git at him . " They nodded in agreement . " That 's about it , Mis ' Matt . Git him tore up an ' git at him that-a-way . " They hid several demijohns in near-by cover and hurried anxiously the two ways of the road . They reported later in the village that they heard no sound for an hour or so . Toward noon their straining ears caught the crash of an axe on metal . There was the high thin splintering of glass . The isolated crashes settled into a steady shattering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke began to rise from the vicinity of the still . The Lantry to the south skirted the road through the pines and joined his brother . They cut through the woods to the village and announced that the Pro-hi 's had come in from the west and were tearing up Colton 's outfit . The word went out to avoid the flat-woods road . The Lantrys were waiting for Trax when he came through in late afternoon . They flagged him down . They drove with him as far as their own place , telling him what they knew . " When we lit out we could hear ' em maulin ' on the barrels an ' purely see the smoke . Things is tore up an ' burnt up all right . " They conjectured who , of his numerous enemies , might have betrayed him . He drove at a spring-breaking clip over the root-filled ruts of the sand road . His face was black and frightened . When he let the boys out of the ear he had said nothing about the week 's wages . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' bout us gittin ' ten dollars , anyway , Trax ? " " That 's it . I ai n't got it . I on'y got five myself . I was fixin ' to turn over this lot quick . " " We hid out ' bout twenty gallons , if they ai n't found it , " they informed him eagerly . He listened tensely to a description of the location and was gone . He drove into the yard and stopped the car in gear with a jerk . No one was in sight . He ran back of the house to the palmettos . A ring of fire had blackened palms and oaks and myrtle for a hundred feet around . A smoldering pile of bricks and barrel hoops and twisted metal in the center marked the site of the still . He began a frenzied search for the hidden jugs . Matt peered from a window in the front room . She ordered Elly upstairs . " You stay there till I tell you different . " The woman hurried into the yard with a jug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was twenty-five feet from the house , but the direction of the wind was safe . She soaked the hood and seats of the car with oil and piled papers on the floor . She tied a bundle of oil-soaked paper on the endof her longest clothes prop ; touched a match to it . She lowered the pole to the machine . The oil caught fire . When the blaze reached the gas tank , the explosion disintegrated an already charring mass . Trax heard the muffled roar up the incline behind him . The demijohns were where the Lantry boys had indicated . They were broken . He left the stench of over-turned mash and spilled alcohol and ran to the house . He could not for a moment comprehend that the twisting mass of metal and flame was the blue sedan . Matt stood on the rear stoop . He looked at her in bewilderment . His stare dropped from her straggling gray hair down the length of her frame . Her apron was smudged and torn . Her hands were black and raw . He came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You done it yourself ! " He burst into spasmodic curses , then broke off , overcome by their futility . The sweat ran into his eyes . He wiped it out and gaped about him in loose-mouthed confusion . He shuffled a few feet to the stoop and sank down on the bottom step . The woman looked down at him . " Better git goin ' . " He rose , swaying . " You or . . . " His obscenities fell away from her as rain washed from the weathered shingles of the old house . She towered over him . The tall house towered over him . He was as alien as on the bright day when he had first come hunting here . He plunged up the steps toward her , his head low between his shoulders . " Better git back . " His outstretched fists dropped at his sides . The fingers fell open . The woman lifted the shotgun . " Better git ? " He shook his head , unbelieving . His eyes clung to the dark cavities of the pitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step . The woman aimed carefully at the shoe , as though it were some strange reptile creeping into the house . She fired a trifle to the left , so that the pattern of the double-ought buckshot shell sprayed in a close mass into the sand . One pellet clipped through the leather , and a drop of blood sank placidly into the pine step . The man stared fascinated . His hand jerked to his mouth , like a wooden toy moved by strings . He stifled a sound , or tried to make one . The woman could not tell . He lifted a face dry with fear and backed down the steps . It was necessary to walk widely to the side to avoid the heat of the burned car . He threw out his hands hopelessly and hesitated . The sun slanted orange and gold through the hammock . Beyond , there were already shadows among the dark pines . It would be twilight before he could be out of the flat-woods . He found voice . " Matt , " he whined , " howl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her streaked face with a corner of her apron . " Reckon you 'll have to git there on foot , Mister  --  the way you come in the first place . " She turned her back and went into the house . The girl had come down the stairs and was flattened against a wall . Her face was brushed with a desperate knowledge . Matt jerked her head at the open front door . " Ml right . I 'm the . You kin go on with him now . " " Matt ? " " Go on . Git . " The girl did not move . Matt pushed her headlong to the door . Elly took hold of the big arm with both hands , drawing back , and Matt struck her away . She went confusedly down the steps . Trax was leaving the hammock . He struck wildly through the pines . The girl took a few steps after him , then turned toward the woman watching from the doorway . Matt called loudly : " Go on . Git . " The man had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north . The girl ran three or four paces in his direction , then stopped again , like a stray dog or cat that would not be driven away . She hesitated at the edge of the hammock . The small uncertain figure was visible between the twin oaks beyond the high porch . Matt turned into the house and closed the door . She was strong and whole . She was fixed , deep-rooted as the pine trees . They leaned a little , bent by an ancient storm . Nothing more could move them . The car in the yard had settled into a smoking heap . The acrid smell of burned rubber and paint filled the house . Matt closed the north window to keep out the stench . The glass rattled in its frame . The air was gusty and the spring night would be cold . There were swift movements and rattlings among the oak boughs above the roof , as though small creatures were pattering across the floor of the wind . Matt shivered and kindled a fire in the front room . She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day had driven him to distant hunting grounds and he had not yet ventured to return . She drew close to the fire in her rocker and held her smudged hands to the blaze . She thought , " I 've it a bait o ' fires to-day . " That was over and done with . There would be no more ' shining among the palmettos ; no more coming and going of folk ; no more Trax and his owl-faced girl . She was very tired . Her square frame relaxed in its exhaustion . She leaned back her head and drowsed deeply in her chair . When she wakened , the fire had burned to ashes . The moon rode high over the flat-woods , with clouds scurrying underneath . The room was silver , then black , as the moonlight came and went . The chill wind sucked through the pines . There was another sound ; the sobbing of a lighter breath . Suddenly Matt knew the girl was still there . She rose in a plunge from the rocker . She was n't done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few inches and listened . The muffled sound was unmistakable . It was the choked gasping of a child that has cried itself breathless . It came from the edge of the hammock . Where the pines began she could distinguish a huddle on the ground that was neither stump nor bushes . She closed the door . Trax was gone -- and Elly was here . He had flung away and left her behind . She was discarded , as Matt had been long discarded . He was through with Elly , too . For the first time the woman was able to conceive of them separately . And the one was gone , and the other was here . She groped her way stupefied to the kitchen , lighted a kerosene lamp , and made a fire in the range . She wanted a scalding pot of tea to stop her shivering . She split a cold biscuit and fried it and sat down with her plate and tea-cup . She breathed hard , and ate and drank mechanically . " Pie was done with her a long ways hack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sedan , not to infuriate , but because there was nothing else to do with the girl . Matt chewed her biscuit slowly . She laughed grimly . " I give him too much credit fer smartness . " A flash of anger stirred her , like a spurt of flame from an old fire , that Elly should be now at the edge of the ham mock . " Trax wa' n't man enough to take off his mess with him . " She sipped her cooling tea . She remembered grudgingly the girl 's contentment . The shadow of the man , passing away , left clear the picture of a child , pulling moss apart and cutting paper dolls . Rage at Trax possessed her . " I 'd orter hided him fer takin ' sech a young un along his low-down way . " In a burst of fury she conceded the girl 's youth . Elly was too young . . " I 'd orter been bided . Me an ' Trax together . " Matt rose from the table and gathered up the few dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands as though their knotty strength were strange to her . " Snatchin ' off a young un 's rations . . . " She leaned heavily on the table , pondering . Emptiness filled the house ? a living presence  --  appalling  --  still . She strode abruptly out the door and through the hammock to the pines . The moon had swung toward its setting and the rays lay long under the trees . The girl lay crouched against a broad mottled trunk . Matt said , " You kin come on back . " The emaciated figure wavered from the ground on spindling legs . It tried to crowd close to the warmth of the woman 's body . As they moved toward the house , the girl stumbled in the run-over slippers . Matt said , " Here . Gim me them crazy shoes . " Elly stooped and took them from her bare feet . The woman put them in her apron pockets . She went ahead of the girl into the front room and bent down to kindle a fire .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
