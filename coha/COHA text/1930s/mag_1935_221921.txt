Through a cemetery in San Antonio , Tex . one day last week moved soldiers , priests , politicians , Governor James V. Allred , San Antonio 's Catholic Archbishop Arthur Jerome Drossaerts , Mexico 's exiled Apostolic Delegate Leopoldo Ruiz y Flores , and a hearse bearing a coffin containing a heap of old bones . Into a fresh grave went the bones , good Catholic dust , buried 200 years ago in a San Antonio mission cemetery , lately dug up in good preservation during excavation for a new post office .
