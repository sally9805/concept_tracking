I nodded . I signed his book but my hand shook . " There was no message with the money . I must shake your hand . Some day perhaps I shall shake His hand . " He pushed two hundred marks under the grille and extended his hand . I took the money as calmly as possible . Bran , two feet away , could not conceal what went on in his mind . He had been traveling for ten days with a man who received money by telegram from Hitler ! There was nothing to say and I said nothing . Bron asked no questions , feeling sure that he knew what he wanted to know , but we were far from the Polish police now . In silence we rode to Marienwerder . An automobile was waiting for me at the station and I had to say good-by to Bron . I thanked him for the many courtesies . " Do n't mention it , " he said and walked away . I drove to the Governor 's residence . For three hours Dr. Behrend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had always been German . He had a series of maps on display showing the results of archeological researches in the region . " Remains two thousand years old show that this land was inhabited by Germans , long before the Poles ever emerged from their swamp . That 's the best argument . " Then a flood of statistics followed . I was confused . At the end of the interview the Governor said graciously , " My chauffeur will drive you to the station . " I thanked him and we started to the railroad . Since leaving Bron I had felt unhappy . I did not want to be blacklisted in Warsaw . Yet the explanation of that telegram was so complicated and so ridiculous . . . I decided to attempt it . " Instead of the station , " I called to the chauffeur , " drive me to the Polish con-sulate . " He nodded . I met Bran again and told him the story . He smiled and insisted that such misunderstandings arc always possible , that they are sometimes embarrassing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to say ? The Germans are such liars ! " I returned to Berlin . " You 'd better hurry down to the Foreign Office , " a journalist told me . " They 've been hunting all over for you .

An official whom I knew slightly was very cordial , with that sort of sticky cordiality that means to stay close by until it gets what it wants . " You 've been in the Corridor and East Prussia ? Charming country , is n't it ? " Then , bluntly , " You saw Dr. Behrend ? Then you went from his house to the Polish consulate where a member of the Polish intelligence service was staying .

" With pleasure . And may we have the pleasure of sending you a few books on the Corridor question ? " A letter reached me three months later , in a brown envelope , with N.S.D.A.P. on the cover .

TO LIVE ALONE A STORY BY NANCY HALE JULIALEIGHTON had been in New York J for more than four months before she found anyone to be her friend . By the time she met Abel Cram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatigue , distaste , and the cancerous doubt that had driven her to the verge of going back to Salem and giving up all idea of trying to be an artist . The night she met the Crams might well have been her breaking-point ; Mrs. Crystal , whose secretary she was by day in order to study art in a night-class , asked her , near dusk , to fill in at that dinner party . Julia went home to her wretched little room on Thirty-Sixth Street to dress . Something about the docility with which she had said yes to her employer , and the shameful eagerness she felt to skip , for once , the weary three hours at the night-class suddenly made her lean in her pink silk slip against the painted window-frame and look out in despair at the night scene that was for her a portrait of disappointment and impotency : the Chrysler Building , the Chanin Building , black bulks of other buildings , their blurred lights shining cold and meaningless against the hard night sky . She knew how much she needed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacks of her own nature , although in Salem she had felt omnipotent . She knew , now , that she was not self-sufficient . She had all the talent sheneeded , but without someone 's close interest , without encouragement , it was a talent that turned feeble and sick ; it did not nourish itself . She was too pretty to have learned to rest with an iron weight on talent , as a sole salvation . Four months ' loneliness had destroyed her spirit , and all she wanted now was to live pleasantly and have friends . She went about her dressing feeling numb , realizing that she had lost , taking a warm bath , shivering under a cold shower , drawing on her only good pale stockings , the pattern of her four months in New York flickering through her mind dully . Deep and sharp in her heart she really knew that she could not stand any more of it , that now soon , perhaps to-morrow , she would buy the ticket , take the train , go back , and for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a /ark . It had never been a lark . It never would be . With sureness and enthusiasm she had quickly laid out her life on arriving in New York . The job as secretary to the editor of a fashion magazine , that paid for the room which was n't nice at all ( but what would she care for a room when she was working so hard , at last , at painting ? ) , that paid for the three-hour class every night under Bertram Worden , the particular man she had wanted to learn from , and that filled her day with work , work , hard work . Work had been all she thought of greedily in those days that were so curiously far away . . . . Work , work , work , she thought now , buttoning the three buttons of her pink silk drawers , one , two , three . Work , work , work . She had known very soon that the daytime job was something to hate . Hard , clever women , obsessed with the particular cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little hoarse , overbearing , immaculate , and quite fanatic ; it was something so foreign to Julia that she was made sometimes aghast , sometimes horribly amused , sometimes sick . But there was n't any time to look for another job ; besides , it should n't matter ; besides , she might not find another ; besides , she must simply learn not to care so much ; besides  --  and in the meantime the diseased quality of the atmosphere infected her and helped to destroy her spirit , make her weary and afraid and ill as she was now . . . . There had been no friend there . By seven o'clock in the evening she used to be at the studio . It was an immense , echoing place at the top of a great office building , glaring with glassy radiance , high and filled with the tiny absorbed sounds of work : the scraping of an easel along the concrete floor , the hitching of the model 's chair as she adjusted it on the stand , the thin long drag of sharpened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet across the room , an asthmatic cough , someone breathing through his teeth . The students worked in a broad ragged semicircle , all in that large strange void , the lower part lit with harsh blue-white light and the upper part dim and high and intangible where the skylights slanted against the gray New York night . The students were a tired , intent lot , breathing hard as they worked , not joking or singing together or taking a little time off for a smoke , or making friends in any of the ways that other classes in other places at other times of day would . These worked with a sort of weary de-termination . They shifted their feet heavily under the easels , not glancing at one another . Sweating , soiled , wearing clothes harsh with the day 's dust , they worked as if they ' were working against time . They had only those three hours at night to give . Almost none of them was very good . Most of them seemed self-taught , Their faces were almost agonized ; they smeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the round electric clock above the door went click .. . click . . . click . . . . Julia used to work intensely too , and all alone . In that class they could do as they wished , paint or draw in any medium they chose ; and with that sense of hurry and fatigue which was in the air she used to set up a small painting one night , look at it with terrible disappointment the next , and do a series of red-chalk drawings , tear those up the next night , and spend a quarter of an hour feverishly sharpening charcoal . There was such a sense of oppression and panic haste . . . . Far away there was the steady moan of rushing motors , the sad sound of the horns , and the occasional insistent whistle in the night . Something was pushing at them , pushing at them , so that nothing they did ever seemed very good . Twice a week round nine o'clock Worden would come in to give criticism . That tiny door in the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come in . They hardly looked , they were hurrying so , they were so impatient and discontent . He would go around the semi-circle from one to the next , and in that room his voice could hardly be heard by the others ; besides , they never listened , but worked , worked , because the clock went on , tick ... tick ... toward ten o'clock when they had to stop . He would sit in front of Julia 's work ; he seemed pleased with it , but he was tired , and he never picked flaws ; he did not really help her . He stared at the easel , his legs planted apart , nodding a little , nodding , holding the brush and making little dead gestures , saying " Yes .. yes . . . you seem to have it right . " Once he said , " A little bit the quality of a Rembrandt etching , " and nodded , got up , dragged on to the next student . When it was ten o'clock none of them would move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still nearer to the smeary canvases ; but then someone always came and snapped out the big strong lights , so that there was only a little dull light beside the door . Their work disappeared into shadow before their eyes ; their hands fell against their thighs , interrupted and exhausted . Then they all stretched and lifted their pictures down from the easels slowly , and put them away in stacks next to the green tin lockers that belonged to the students who painted in the daytime , by daylight , when these night students were working . They all went home then silently . They had no energy to give to friendships or to singing in class or to any of those things . Julia , in all those four months , felt herself being made sick by this hopelessness and exhaustion . She knew she was not learning anything . She knew she ought to change , that there must be something better for her in this city . But somehow the work of the day and the work of the night seemed to have drugged her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but did not ever know what to do about it . Less and less she knew what to do . She was only lost . She used to walk home slowly along the bright cold sidewalks , with her feet heavy and her back sore from the three hours ' intensity . The little spots of mica glittered in the city pavement under the arc-lights , that glared without flickering . She smelled the dead gassy smell , walking slower , slower , so as not to come home too soon to that room . Then she used to realize dully what was the matter with her . She was not complete alone . She had the talent , the things she needed , but all alone she could not aim them , refresh them ; she could only go on working in the way she had begun . She needed someone to help her . She needed someone to tell her . She needed someone to make her mind fresh again when it had gone stale from work and loneliness . She knew she needed a friend , but there did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always Salem . The room when she went into it was large and warm and bright with soft light ; a great many people were sitting in it , the women in deep warm colors of wine and purple and yellow . This was the first party of any sort that Julia had been to in four months . She felt awkward and suspicious , principally because she was so deeply distrustful of Mrs. Crystal , and dreaded an enlargement of the brittle , tinny atmosphere of the office . For all she knew , these would be people who twittered at her and raved of the divine and the amusing . She went away from Mrs. Crystal 's hospitable , patronizing handshake and sat down in a miniature gray-silk sofa before the fire that snapped and twinkled in a tiny gaiety . Inside , secretly , she felt herself surrounded by a new safety ; she found she was saying to herself : None of this matters , for I am going home to Salem , where it is pleasant , where it is kind , where it .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocktail in a glass with a fantastic long stem . In four minutes she was happy and gay as she had not been in so very long . He was exaggeratedly thin and pale ; he had dark good brown eyes and his own way of laughing . He was not young , but he had a deep sympathetic curiosity ; she was telling him everything , all of it , as she had thought she would never tell anybody . Not sighing over it , but joking at her misfortunes , and then she was asking him , and laughing , whether he did n't think it was shameful for one to work on a fashion magazine  --  I mean , one who pretends to care about things that are supposed to be better . He laughed too , but so gently and as if he knew just why she had asked , as if lie were in on all the secret of her particular loneliness and her particular distaste for that particular kind of office  --  somehow with more sympathy than she had ever felt before . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , lowering his voice and making a face at Mrs. Crystal 's lovely back . " Sometimes you find yourself doing something like that . Mallarme used to work on a fashion magazine  --  the Bon Ton . " They both laughed . " It 's all in planning one 's life to avoid those things , " he said . " You ca n't always do it for yourself . People need friends to help them out of holes like that . " " I know , " she said and stared at him breathless . She did not know what was happening but she knew she had a friend now . By the end of the evening she had two . Abel and his wife Anita , the tall , still woman who seemed to be older than Abel , but was curiously like him , as if perhaps she had copied his sympathy , or he had copied hers . They seemed to be very close together , they spoke in " we 's , " and they sat after dinner and talked , gently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her in no time . She knew they liked her ; they watched her together , as if somehow they needed her as much as she needed them . They took her home from the party in a big shiny car ; they said good-by and made dates for approaching days . " It will make us feel good to have someone as young as you around , " Anita said . In bed she lay , without once having stopped to stare out of that dreary window , and thought to herself , smiling in the dark , about the liquid , clear look of friendship in Abel 's eyes . And of course , Anita , too . She did n't like Anita quiteso much , she was horrid not to . But she was too wise , too helpful , and too sure to be right . It was not something you entirely trusted . Suddenly she felt it was because Anita would always be right about things , that if you did what Anita said you would succeed at what you did ; but Abel knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that although he might not always be able to tell you how to get it . . . . She went off to sleep and she did not think of Salem at all any more . Late in the afternoons she would go round to the Crams ' cool white apartment , after her office work was over , and talk and drink a cocktail , and they would give her a plate of hot nourishing little sandwiches before she had to go away to her night class . They would receive her so warmly , so affectionately ; there was no doubt of how glad they were to see her . She grew prettier and gayer . They used to sit opposite her in their long , white room , slumped comfortably in their rough white chairs , and watch her , both of them looking happy , and make her talk of what she wanted to do , about her painting . A little at a time , they began changing things in her life that had made her miserable . " Worden is n't honestly the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good painter but too burnt out by his own work to give anything to teaching . Naturally you are unhappy there . There 's nothing to lift you . Now if you will let us we are going to make arrangements to have you enter Rampc 's class . It 's at night too , darling , if you must work at night . " They did that for her . A little later they did still more . " There would be at least two groups that want to work from a model , " Anita said . " Perfect dubs of course , society ladies who want to say they draw . You 're just what they need to run their classes , see to everything . And of course they would be evening classes . Then you could work in the daytime , in Rampe 's day class . " They changed her whole life into something that moved swiftly , whose beautiful current she would not have altered for a moment . Anita thought of so many things , found the other pretty room at no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anita really did all of it . Abel would only sit there , slumped down in the deep white chair by the fireplace , and smile across at her , from his eyes into hers , and ask her the right questions , make the right , the true answers , as somehow Anita never could . But Anita was more than an angel . She was sure and practical and always right , and she made Julia 's life from something that had nearly finished her into something that was moving fast , fast , toward wonderful things . . . . She was the best pupil in Rampe 's class and she knew that Rampe was pushing her . The days of Mrs. Crystal 's office and the sad little room , the dreary black nightscape of skyscrapers and all the bitter loneliness ? all of them were very far away now She almost never saw Anita and Abel separately . They were always together and they did what they did together , Anita always close by Abel 's side . They were , together , her good friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Anita was alone . It seemed strange with Abel not there , and Anita seemed nervous and not her whole self with Abel away . Julia had to say something then about what she felt about all they had done for her , and she said a little , stumbling over her gratitude . It was hard to talk to Anita alone . . . and so easy to talk and talk when Abel was there . Anita looked at her so quietly ; she felt something suddenly that was almost pitiful in Anita . " We love to do anything we can , " she said . " We love to . . . We like to watch life , you know . We like to watch people like you going on and doingthings ; that 's really our life , and it 's all we want to be able to help you . We sit together and talk people over , and watch . . . that 's really all our life . " Anita was not young . Julia wondered how much older she was than Abel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much Anita loved Abel . You could see it in her eyes and in her calm when he was there , and you could see it in her painfully lost look and the way she watched the little white metal clock on the mantel when he was not there . And yet she had not anything to make her sad or restless when they were always close together and devoted . No matter if she were a little older , Anita had Abel for her husband , and nobody could want more than Abel , Julia thought . She sat in her chair with her cocktail , one afternoon a little later , and wondered , looking across at Abel smiling , why Anita was restless when he was away and uncertain . Nobody could want more than Abel for a husband , just to have him , because he was true and right and his eyes were so gay and brown . " I think it 's wonderful , " Anita said , and her voice was sharp in the warm softness of the lazy room . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three months , and he thinks  --  I wonder if you know all he thinks , Julia . We saw him at a dinner last night , did n't we , Abel ? " " Yes , " he said absently . He squinted up his eyes and threw a cigarette stub , ping , into the precise center of the red-and-yellow fire . " Yes . The old boy appears to think pretty damn highly of you , Julia . I do n't know . . Anita leaned forward and laid her hand on Julia 's arm . She was a very handsome woman , thin and tall , and fine-drawn in her face ; a little tired-looking all the time , as if she used herself up in some eternal effort . " Darling , I think he would move you into the little painting class  --  you know , his special one that has only the James man and two others . You know what that means . You 'd be ready to show , he 'd make you ready to show and help you to arrange it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's going to invite you . You 're on your way , darling . " Julia thew her breath in quickly . Her mind reeled a little at the rhythm she felt herself moving in , faster , faster , all the longed-for things opening up to her in a twinkling . There seemed to be no stopping now . The Crams were her friends . Abel jumped up on his feet with a harsh movement . " You ought not to do it . Refuse him if he asks you . You 're not ready for it . He 'd push you too quick  --  you need another year of grinding away in the mill . You know you do . Do n't let yourself rush at things . There 's no hurry . If you once get started showing , being known , you 'll never get a chance again to learn the long slow fundamentals , learn them slowly . You 've got to move slowly , thoroughly . Rampe 's good as hell . He can teach you all you need . But he 'll hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he will ; he gets too enthusiastic and spoils some of his best pupils that way . " Julia looked at him . He stood in front of her , thin and stooping in his intensity , staring hard into her face with those brown eyes . All of his face was twisted and strained with feeling . Julia felt something jerk at her heart . " You 're so good to me , " she stammered . " It upsets me so  --  to see you really care about me . I do n't see why you do . I do n't know what I 'd do without you . " She was almost crying . It was Anita who pulled things back into lightness and laughter . " Darling ! What should we do without you ? You 're our little career . We 're just selfish as the devil . A lovely young brilliant thing like you in the house all the time  --  think of all we get C " But Abel went on standing there , tense and staring at her , his hand pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it like the spokes of a fan . " You wo n't do it , will you ? It would spoil so much for you in the end , You 'd never be as good as you might be . " " I wo n't , " Julia said . She smiled up at his face with tears in her eyes ; she smiled with everything she had hard into his eyes ; he looked so dear and . . . he always knew the thing you really wanted , he understood what you wanted . She had to go soon . She went out into the dim hall and Abel went with her , and held her coat . She turned round from his hands on her shoulders and looked up at him . " Abel . Have you any idea how much difference it makes to have a friend who really cares about you ? I ca n't tell you how I feel . " He put both his arms around her , tight , and kissed her as if he could not bear to stop . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's a lot like being sick and knowing that you 've got to live with your sickness all the days and all the nights for the rest of your life . " He had called for her at Rampe 's class at noon . The sun was high and yellow and the day was cold and they walked down Fifth Avenue together , arm in arm , to lunch . He wore a bowler hat and a dark-blue coat , and she looked at the blue cloth beside her glove and thought how she would love to kiss it because it was his coat . They went into a warm little restaurant and Abel ordered them hot soup and eggs that bubbled when they came in a casserole . They sat side by side on the leather bench and ate ravenously . " I 've got to live with being in love with you , whether I like it or not , all the rest of my life , " he said . The sharp little needle of despair jabbed her heart . It had been stabbing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he kissed her . " 1 do n't see how I can get along without you , " she said . " If you knew what it was like before I knew you . " " Do n't try . " " I do n't see what else I can do . " " Look , my darling , I love you so terribly much . I should think you would have known that I have ever since I saw you first . I fell in love with you . Do n't you understand that ? I love you , Julia . " " I love you , " she said almost whispering . " And I want you . " " What . . . about . . . Anita ? " she said , whispering it word by word . It was the first time she had made it into words . " Anita , " he said . He began to eat his dessert slowly and he did not say anything . They walked out into the dazzling daylight again and walked and walked , slowly , keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day do n't go back , " he said . " Come up to the apartment , and for God 's sake let 's talk together in peace . " " Anita " ? the name ran round dizzily in her mind . " We 'd be alone . " They sat down on the broad , rough white sofa . There was n't any use ; in less than a minute she was in his arms and kissing him ; she could feel him breathing close to her ear , warm and sweet , and she loved him so much that she shook all over . " I love you so . " " I Love you so . " " I always have . " " I always have . " " Julia , will you live with me ? " The sunlight came streaming in the slatted blinds . The yellow afternoon sun came streaming in . " What about . . . Anita ? " He sat up . His face was thin and beautiful . " I do n't know what about Anita . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streamed in . All the rest of Julia 's life , the past and the future , seemed improbable , and there was only this moment , these moments , sitting close to Abel and touching him and smelling him , and the yellow sun in stripes upon the floor . . . . " She . . . does me the honor to be a great deal in love with me , Julia . She 's . . . older than I am . I feel like a damned fool . I do n't think she could stand it if I left her . She 's . . . a queer sort of woman . I do n't quite know what she 'd do . I 'm afraid of what it might be . She seems to have made me her whole life . I 've got to make you understand . " " You mean you could n't marry me . " The yellow sun . ? . " I mean I do n't think I could humanly let her know that I love you . It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she feels . " The stab hard in the heart . " I do n't see how I 'm going to live without you . " I do n't see how , I do n't see how , I do n't see .. . " We must n't try . It would be just as wrong . We 've got to take all we can . " " I do n't see why I have to love you so . " " You darling foot , did n't you even know we fell in love with each other that first night at dinner ? You 're so young . You 're too lovely and young not to have everything . I ca n't give you everything . But I have to have you . You realize that , do n't you , we love each other too much not to have each other ? " " No . No . Listen . Do n't you see , Anita has been my friend . She has done more for me than anybody ever except you . " " Darling , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I have to . Anita does those things . Anita does anything she thinks I want ; she outdoes me twenty times over in the things I do , because she loves me , because she wants me to see how much what I want to do matters to her . Oh , Anita . . . . I 'm so sorry . She saw of course how much you interested me at once . She could n't let me think she was jealous of it or did n't want me to do things for you . So she did them  --  more than I could have done  --  everything she could think of to do . " " You mean it was n't me at all , to her . " " Not really  --  you understand . She  --  I would n't tell you this except to make you see , but sometimes I have waked up in the middle of the night , and what waked me was Anita , leaning over my bed , crying so horribly . " " Crying ? " " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it ca n't ever be what she wants  --  some wild , lovely dream of loving tremendously and passionately . But you ca n't do anything if it is n't there . She 's so heart-breaking . . . . I need you so . I have to have you . " " She 'd know . " Everything inside Julia ached slowly in a kind of aching rhythm . Life , after all , Life was all wrong . Life would always be all wrong because Abel . . . because she loved Abel . " She need n't . That 's it . " " She would . If she loves you that way she would . I know . I know . " He leaned to light a cigarette from the table in front of the sofa . Julia 's head leaned against the sofa 's back . The sunlight on the floor flickered and grew longer . Anita came in , with a click of the front door , the steps sharp in the hall ; her tall , whittled-down thin figure in the doorway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How pretty you look ! " The words were as light and laughing as birds flying from her lips , but her face and her eyes , and her hands pushed against the door frame , were more terrible than anything Julia had ever seen . Wild longing , love , defeat , desire , terrible , tragic , consuming desire , that burnt like a deep hot fire , deep with inextinguishable coals , forever and ever , that would never go out . Julia took a long breath . " I hoped you 'd come in , Anita . Can we have some tea ? I 'm starved . " " Poor little waifl Right away . You 're a. fine kind of host , my darling husband . " Slowly , the fire sank back into the eternal coals that smoldered forever . Relief and calm glazed Anita 's eyes over . But the way she had looked  --  Julia could never forget that as long as she might live . She would not even stir from the door step of the building when he came again at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would not move . She stood there because she did not dare to go to any warm little restaurant or walk along the frosty sunny streets with him . She talked in that corner of the hallway , and the other students hurried past on their way out , people came in , the glass doors swung shut with a thud , swung shut again . He leaned against the wall beside her . It hurt her to look at him . " I could n't do it to her . I could n't do it to her . " There did not seem to be any other words for her to say . Only those words , over and over , that she had thought over and over , all night , all morning ; that she would always have to think . He looked as if he were sick . He was so gray and so thin . " I need you , Julia . I need you terribly . You need me too . Do n't you understand how much you need me ? My darling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . Darling , there are some women who are absolutely helpless alone and yet who can be so much if they have someone . You know you 're one of them . " " I could n't do it to her .

Ca n't you trust me , that it 's wrong to let this go , not to get all the wonderful , lovely things we could ? Do n't you think I 've thought my bloody brains out over it ? . . . I ca n't get along without you . " " I ca n't get along without you . " It was a mistake to let herself say it . She looked at his face and his eyes and the shape of his shoulders , and felt her heart faint . " Of course you could n't . Oh , my poor , sweet little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need so much help . You know you 're lost when you 're alone ; you can have so much in life , but you need a friend to help you . You need .. . " She started forward , as if she were wild , and gave him one more quick glance and looked away . " I could n't do it to her . It 's wrong . It 's wrong . " And she was running down the street , actually running , without looking behind her , with her heart pumping madly , running like a child , running away from him because she wanted to stay so much . It did not matter what Anita thought , when she refused to see them any more , when she made up silly excuses as shallow as water . Nothing Anita thought , nothing at all , would be as bad as what Anita might have known . One year , and then two years , Julia lived , wanting Abel a little less and a little less , but always with her whole heart . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She saw nobody that even had the faintest quality of actuality for her . Abel was as alive in her mind as if he were with her  --  but he was not , and she wanted him , desperately sometimes and sometimes pitifully . She was lonely . There were plenty of people to meet , but she did not need people ; she needed a particular person to give her the particular understanding she must have . And there was nobody else who could do that in the world . Sometimes she wanted Abel so much that she was frantic ; the thing was absurd , walking round and round a little room aching for another human being , who was alive , somewhere else . They were both alive . But she never doubted , not once , that her decision had been right . There was nothing she ever felt as terrible as Anita 's face in the afternoon sun . She kept herself busy . She made herself busier still , working with all of her energy and moving , she knew it , forward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was easily the first among Rampe 's pupils . She worked hard for two years . All that time she was oddly conscious of being guided by the things Abel had told her in the old days . Sometimes she could hear his voice in her ears , telling her how to work , telling her again just what it was that she wanted from her life . For two years she was sure of herself ; what he had told her carried her along . Then Rampe told her she was ready to have a show . He said he would help her , even hang the exhibition for her . He beamed at her like a swollen red cupid . " Of course , you 'll have to make up your own mind about it . I ca n't tell whether you feel ready or not . The real decision 's up to you . " She had to make up her own mind . And she could not . She was not sure , she felt first one way and then the other , violently . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing better even than Abel ? There was no reason on earth why she should have this feeling that Abel knew everything in the world better than anyone else , that his advice was all that counted for anything to her . And Rampe was her teacher and ought to be her guide . Her work was all that she had left in her heart . She wanted that , to do good work and be known for it . She would like to show her work really . She thought of the exhibition with a hurry of the pulse at the thought of the critics seeing and judging what Julia Leighton of Salem had painted . The work was good , she knew it was . If she did n't trust Rampe she ought to , because he must know ; her doubt was nothing but that crazy ache for Abel , that ridiculous superstition that nobody knew but Abel what was right for her to do , nobody , ever , in the whole world . That was absurd . One morning she woke up and knew she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must . She called him up on the telephone , after two years , and asked him to take her to lunch . His voice was remote , tiny on the other end of the wire . He said , " Certainly , " and asked her how she was . " Are you still painting ? " he asked . The sun was shining and the day was frosty as she walked alone along the streets to the restaurant . The sun was shining , yellow and bright , and the beams lay in stripes where they fell between the buildings upon the sidewalks , in stripes that flickered like a little fire . " How are you , my dear ? " He was just the same , and thin and beautiful , but he spoke to her pleasantly , practically , of the weather and the town , and when he looked at her his eyes were pleasant too , pleasant brown surfaces that looked toward her . Eating eggs that bubbled when they were brought in , she asked him what she ought to do . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface of him , needing something of him . " Julia . I do n't know what I can say . I 'm not in touch with your work , I do n't honestly know whether you 're ready to show yet or not . I ca n't very well know , can I ? " He looked at her kindly and ate his eggs . " I . . . I do n't know why , I felt that you would know what I ought to do , I thought you 'd just . .. know . " " Julia . . . I know what you mean . I used to know things about you , the way you mean , because I was so in love withyou that some crazy instinct came into being that told me . People can do that when they 're in love . If that particular thing happens , people in Love can tell each other things that they could n't possibly be expected to know with their minds . That 's the way I knew things about you when I was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't in love with me any more ? " " Well , .. you did n't want me to be , did you ? " " No . I did n't . " " You see that 's the way things are . I wanted to be your friend . I 'm fond of you now of course . But I was in love with you  --  that way I could n't have been just your friend . It had to be the other thing , friendship and all that other too . But you did n't want that . So there had to be nothing . You see why , do n't you ? " " Yes . " They went out later into the glaring daylight , and they said good-by on the curb . A little way down the street she turned and watched him walking up toward the corner , thin and a little stooped , walking away from her toward whatever he had next to do in his life . She went home . A month later she had the show . Rampe worked hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be done , but the notices were somewhat condescending . " Miss Leighton , " they said , " seems to be a young woman of some talent , ably instructed , but her work is hardly to be considered mature . Perhaps with time more will come to be expected from this young . . . " One of the critics embodied his review in an article discussing the hurry young painters seemed to be in for public exhibition . He deplored the immature tendency toward rushing into galleries , from , as he expressed it , the first-year painting class . " Awfully too bad , " Rampe said . " You 'd better come back to the class next year and do some more hard studying .
