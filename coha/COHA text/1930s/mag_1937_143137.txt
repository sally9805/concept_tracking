His iron-grey hair flying , his firm jaws clenched , Conductor Artur Rodzinski mounted a podium in Manhattan 's Rockefeller Center one day last week , and with a brisk downbeat of his baton started a new orchestra through its paces . He soon exclaimed : " Marvelous ! The strings are fantastically fine . ... I doubt if there has ever been assembled anywhere , at any time , a new orchestra that promises so much for the future . " <P> The new orchestra had 92 members , some of them seasoned players in National Broadcasting Co. orchestras , others newly hired from symphonies all over the world . Titled the NBC Symphony Orchestra , it was especially assembled to play under Arturo Toscanini when that exacting little maestro arrives in the U. S. in December , to fulfill the contract he signed with NBC last winter ( TIME , Feb. 15 ) . For the ten concerts he will conduct on Saturday nights ( 10 to 11:30 E. S. T. on both NBC networks ) , Toscanini will receive $40,000 plus his passage and U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be maintained the year around by a broadcasting company . NBC 's orchestra will be drilled for the next month by Rodzinski , commuting between Manhattan and Cleveland , where this week he opens the 20th season of the Cleveland Orchestra . Rodzinski and Pierre Monteux will conduct three NBC concerts apiece before Toscanini 's arrival . The 92 men of the orchestra were chosen from among 700 applicants , to the concern of at least one orchestra-the Detroit Symphony , which is losing five men to NBC . <P> Concertmaster , that necessarily capable violinist who sits near the conductor , acts as his working assistant , is Mischa Mischakoff , onetime concertmaster of the Chicago Symphony , founder of a string quartet which for twelve years bore his name , owner of a $50,000 Stradivarius . The rest of the orchestra is well up to his high par .
