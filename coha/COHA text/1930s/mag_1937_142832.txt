Ten years ago , from their cloistered monastery in Indianapolis , sisters of the Discalced ( unshod ) Carmelite order sent word to their friends that they wished a new monstrance ( altar vessel in which the Sacred Host is exposed ) . A piece at a time , gold came in to the sisters in the form of rings , pins , bracelets , keepsakes . The Carmelites had a monstrance designed by a firm of goldsmiths in Utrecht . Planning to have the monstrance plated , they sent the jewelry to a smelter to be converted into bullion . But they reckoned without President Roosevelt 's gold acts of 1933 and 1934 . Last week , in response to queries from the Carmelites regarding sending their bullion abroad , the Treasury Department informed them they must surrender it to the U. S. Mint . The sisters learned they would get only $600 for the metal which they had thought was worth $2,000 . Chagrined , they faced a choice between waiting for more donations or buying a comparatively plain monstrance from a religious supply house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
