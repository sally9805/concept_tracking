txt Property . During those dark days when America labored under the handicaps of the NRA we were told almost daily that what our country needed was the elimination of all restrictions upon business and production . The economy of abundance was extolled . There are echoes of this same philosophy today . Ogden Mills and others tell over and over that the hope of America rests upon widespread production , which brings in its wake reduced prices and an increased capacity of the consumer 's pocketbook to purchase the cheapened commodity . By some strange perversity , the rising tide of recovery finds no such pleasant news for the consumer at all . Shoes are going up in price , and what has that to do with the AAA ? Clothing is sky-rocketing , and how does that tie up with plowing cotton into the ground ? Even steel is getting ready to ask for higher prices with the blessings of our Supreme Court  --  F. A. SIEVERMAN Jr. , New York .               @ @ @ @ @ @
