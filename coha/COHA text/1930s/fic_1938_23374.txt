F.O.B. DETROIT A STORY BY WESSEL SMITTER R uss and I were waiting in the crowded employment office at the Ifolt automobile factory when one of the clerks came out with a piece of paper . " Any of you fellows here ever run a manipulator ? " he asked . Not a man answered . " What 's a manipulator ? " Russ whispered . " A kind of derrick , " I said . " Used for handling hunks of hot steel . " " Let 's grab it , " he said . " Wait a minute ? " I warned him . " You do n't know what you 're getting into . " " If it 's a machine , " he said , " I can run it . " Russ is a big fellow and confident . The clerk looked the men over . He noticed Russ . " Anybody here , " he said , " that 's had experience running electric cranes ? " " That manipulator job ? " said Russ , " I'Il take it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Ever run one ? " the clerk asked . " No , but I 've run donkey engines and loaders . I 'm a good learner . It wo n't take me Tong to get what I do n't know . " The fellow scratched his head . " All right , " he said . " We 'll give you a try . Where 's your helper ? " " Right here . " And he pointed to me . I had a job . It all happened so quick I did n't know whether to be glad or not . We went up and filled out our cards . " What 's the matter ? " said Russ . " You look disgusted . You think I stuck my foot into something , do n't you ? " " Not your foot , " I said . " Your neck . You got any sort of idea the kind of job you grabbed off for us ? " " No . You ? " " No . All I know  --  I 've seen it a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They use it handling big steel . It 's so complicated they have to get a factory man every time it breaks down . " " Swell , " he said . " We 're going to have fun . We 're going to learn something . " " But that outfit 's complicated , " I said . " More gears and levers than you ever saw . Got an iron claw that picks up ten-ton billets of steel and sticks ' em into the furnaces . Pulls ' em out when they get hot and holds ' em under steam hammers as high as a two-storey building . I 'd be scared to climb up on it . Suppose the thing got out of control . Then what ? " " They give a man a chance to learn , do n't they ? They do n't expect him to get up there and run it the first day , do they ? " " Oh , sure . They let you learn . Even if you could run it , they would n't let you , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's all that matters . " Early the next morning I was in the drop forge , near the time clock , waiting for Russ . The night shift was still on and the heavy production machinery was running full blast . Rows of furnaces were shooting out flames and smoke round the door ; hammers and presses were pounding out front axles , gear blanks , and such . The floor of the building covered five or six acres and the ground trembled and shook . Over in a far corner of the building the top of the manipulator loomed up through the smoke like a battleship 's turret , the big boom , or arm , sticking out like a ship 's gun . Russ came in and we went up to the machine . It was as big as a locomotive , and higher  --  mounted on a carriage that ran over steel rails , wide apart , laid in the concrete floor . On the carriage were other rails that ran crosswise and the superstructure ran on these so that the machine could run in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big arm , or boom , projected that turned with the superstructure . The arm could be raised or lowered , shortened or made longer , turned or pivoted in any direction and on the end there was a claw with two curved iron fingers big enough to go round a bass drum . Steel ladders ran up the sides of the machine , and from where we stood we could see the tops of two rows of brass control levers . I think the machine weighed sixty tons . " That 's her , " I said . " Still want to run it ? " " Oh , sure , " he said . " She 's a honey . I think we 're gon na get along swell . There 's room here , room to work . " At the end of the long floor were piles of cold steel , all sizes and shapes . Along one side were the furnaces , some of them under slow heat , grumbling and purring . On the other side were the heavy presses and hammers reaching up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty or fifty feet above the floor , a traveling bridge crane rumbled back and forth , carrying bundles of steel in cable slings to the production machines . The operator stuck his head out of the steel cage as he rode past and looked us over . A timekeep gave us our cards and our badges and told us where to punch in and then let out a yell for Johnson , our straw boss . Johnson came up and he wasshort and the skin on his face was like leather . He had no eyebrows and he looked at us a minute with smoke-colored eyes and said : " Gotcha cards ? " " Yeh . " " Gotcha badges ? " ? yeh.1 , " Follow me . " The three of us walked over to the floor where the machine stood and here Johnson had a little desk on high legs , but no stool . A lot of blueprints were stuck in a wall cabinet and he pulled out one and began looking at it . Russ had started walking off toward the machine when Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " He studied the blueprints again and I motioned to Russ to take it easy and wait and we stood there watching the men drifting in . And then the bell rang and a couple of fellows started oiling the machines ; the steam was turned on in the hammers and the big pistons began warming up  --  sliding up and down in long easy strokes , not quite touching the anvils below . Some little colored lights over the furnaces changed from green to orange and then to red ; the flames backfired a couple of times and then settled down to a steady roar . Johnson raised up again , and called for one of the fellows working on the machine to come over . The man was n't dressed like a Holt worker . He had on a good suit with a pair of coveralls over it and a temporary badge . " Barney , here , " said Johnson , " is from the factory . He 'll break you fellas in . Ride around with him , " he said to Russ . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask questions . I do n't expect you 'll try to handle no jobs the first coupla weeks . " " And this man , " he said , pointing to me , " will take Hank 's place . Introjuice ' em togedda and let Hank show him the work . " " O-keh , " said Barney . " And what 's the schedule ? " " Load five and six . I 'll mark some steel pretty soon . An ' en we 'll pull num-ber three and work it up under number one hammer . " The three of us went to the machine . I got introduced to Hank . After a while Barney finished his oiling , threw in the master switch on the wall , and then he and Russ climbed up on the rig and they rolled down the wide tracks to the end of the bay . In a minute or two they came back , electric horn blowing , and in the big claw sticking out ahead of the rig there was a billet of cold steel that weighed maybe four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five furnace ; Barney maneuvered into position ; aimed for the door and gave Hank a signal . Hank cut off the air , pressed a button , and the heavy door of the furnace slid up toward the ceiling . Barney 's hands fairly played a tune on the levers . The long arm reached in with its load  --  the claw opened and the steel was laid on the furnace floor . The arm retracted and as Hank pressed another button that closed the door , the flames curled and twisted round the steel . " Always cut off the air befo ' opening the furnace , " said Hank . " If you was to forget  --  the flames might shoot out and singe the hair off yo ' buddy . I sho ' do n't like this job . Half the time I 'm trying to remember if I forgot to do something I should  --  the rest of the time I 'm worried les ' I did something I should n't . I 'll be mighty glad when you gets this job learnt and I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of molds . Do n't have to rack my brains about nothin ' . " There was n't much to his job  --  opening and closing the doors ; watching to see that the track was kept clear ; cutting out the switch in emergencies , and a few things like that . Barney and Russ loaded the furnaces and then they rolled up to number one and got ready to do some forging . The biggest steam hammer in the factory was there  --  a pair of shears that had a bite of a thousand tons . What they did to the big billets was likely to give you an idea that steel is about as tough and hard as new cheese , which is all wrong , even when itsbeen in the fire a long time and is up to white heat . Barney pulled the hot billet of steel out of the furnace , got a firm hold , and swung the boom round in front of the hammer . There were experts on the job now . Johnson , who directed the work and made all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the giant blows ; and Barney , who ran the manipulator . His job was to get the steel up on the anvil ; to turn it and tip it  --  to hold it in position while the hammer got in its work . Johnson signaled to get the steel up on the anvil . The hammer got into motion . Not striking , yet  --  but getting ready . Warming up for the signal . That up-and-down motion of the hammer between the smooth slides , that oily flow of movement , gave you an idea of what steam could do : of the power that was held in reserve behind the long piston , of the kind of blows that would come when Johnson gave the signal and the hammer man came down hard on the throttle . The hammer stopped , poised to strike , and the job was all Barney 's . The white-hot billet had to be just so on the anvil  --  had to be just right for the hammer . A slight turn  --  a little to the right  --  a little back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be done quickly . No time to fool , no time to waste , because the steel was all the time losing heat . Five tons of hot steel is something alive , something vicious , waiting for a chance to strike you if you lose control . Barney was clever , all right . He knew the job , knew the machine , knew the signals . And the last was not the least part of the business . Johnson made them all with his right thumb ; mysterious little jerks and twitches  --  jabs over his shoulder  --  past his ear  --  downward . The brass levers snapped back and forth , switches flashed , circuit breakers popped out and slammed back into place , rheostats smoked . I wondered what Russ was thinking about standing up there next to Barney . Plenty , I guessed . The steel was battered and pounded , was dropped to the floor , turned over . The iron claw grabbed a new hold and slammed it back on the anvil for more . The hammer crashed down in full strokes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor . The ground shook . Not light shakes  --  heavy and deep  --  transmitted through a foundation of solid concrete , sixty feet down . They were unable to finish the work in one heat and the steel was put back into the furnace . Afterward , Russ and Barney came down for a drink . Their shirts were soaked . " How 's she going ? " I asked Russ . " Fine and dandy , " he said . " Be a long two weeks for you , " I said . " Riding around up there , doing nothing . " " Do n't worry , " he said . " In a week I 'll be Infiniti ' the thing . See if I wo n't . " The bell rang and we stopped for lunch , and while eating , Russ asked Barney a lot of questions about the job and the rig . About backlash and overloads , dynamic brakes and magnetic clutches . Barney answered the questions , but not with any great show of enthusiasm . He was a traveling mechanic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been round quite a bit and he was full of talk about the towns he 'd been in . When Russ asked a question he answered short and then swung the talk to girls he 'd met in Pittsburgh or Fort Worth . He was telling about a girl in Cincinnati who never warmed up right unless she was riding round on a steamboat with a band playing , when Russ interrupted again . " If one of the rheostats burned out , " he asked , " how would you go about to fix it ? " " Now listen , " said Barney , " it 's lunch time . It 's time off . They 're not paying you now for asking questions . Let 's wait till the bell rings . " " I know , but if you do n't mind ? " " All you have to learn is how to punch those levers . If the rheostat breaks down they 'll get the electricians to fix it . If you get drunk and bust up the rig  --  likethe other fellow did  --  they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But just the same I want to know . " " All right then . You 've got two weeks to learn . You do n't need two weeks . In two days I could turn the job over to you  --  if I wanted to . You 're the kind that learns quick . But what 's the use ? Make the thing look easy and they 'll figure anybody can run it . Then how you gon na hold ' em up for a raise ? " " I had n't thought about that . " " Well , now 's the time to be thinking about it . Look at the job you 'll be handling ! Look at the responsibility ! Ruin one of these blocks and it 's five hundred bucks . Wreck the machine , and it 's thousands . Kill a guy  --  and you 're washed up . They 've taken the seat off the rig so you ca n't sit . They wo n't Let you smoke a cigarette to steady your nerves . And what do you get ? Five bucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this outfit gets more'n that . " " The time to think about all those things , " said Russ , " is later . Right now I 'm trying to get the job learnt . " The bell rang and we went back to work . At the end of the week Russ took over the controls . Barney rode on the machine a couple of days doing nothing ; hung about on the floor a couple more , and then left for Cleveland . By the end of the third week Russ was pretty good  --  good enough to coast along on the job and take it easy if he 'd wanted to . But that was n't his idea . He kept learning . We 'd moved into the same boardinghouse and one night , up in the room while fiddling with his guitar but not really playing , he got an idea . " Listen , " he said , " a pianist does n't stop to look for the keys when he 's playing . What 's to hinder a man learning to run that rig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at them ? There 's only a dozen . " " What 's your idea ? " I said . " Take a little nap now and then ? " " No . Keep my eyes on the steel . On Johnson . Would n't have to stop to look for the controls , for positions . " " Could be done , I guess . Only thing is ? " " Sure it could be done . " " Only thing is there 's a slight difference between playing a piano and running that rig . When the pianist hits the wrong key there 's a sour note but no one gets hurt . You hit the wrong control  --  you may accidentally drop a hunk of steel on somebody 's head . " What I said did n't discourage him . The idea stuck . He hauled a couple of two-by-fours up in the room and rigged up a contraption with two rows of sticks the site and shape of the levers . They were spaced accurately and , like the controls on the rig , could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he practiced night after night . That was all right with me , except that I lost some sleep . But when be started practicing on the rig itself , I watched my step and gave him plenty of clearance , with him looking off into space and paying no attention to what lever he struck . It was n't long before the white-collars up front began taking notice of what was going on on the floor . You 'd see one of them hurrying along down the aisle as though he was late to a circus , and then he 'd see Russ up there on the rig handling steel as though it was cordwood , and he 'd slow down ; come to a stop near a pillar and clean forget what he 'd been in such a hurry about . And then one day they changed the routing of the gangs of tourists that came through the factory and had them all bother us . If it happened that Russ was handling a piece of steel under the big hammer  --  they saw something . It gave them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sioux Center or Oshkosh . One time Herman , who ran the overhead crane and chewed tobacco , spat down from his cage and hit the claw on the machine . Russ was carrying a piece of cold steel . He stopped the rig , lowered the boom , and got Herman 's shirtfrom the cabinet and wiped off the rig . That night , at the clock , they had some words . Not much  --  but sharp . It left bad feelings in both . A day or two later Herman started being careless with his loads  --  swinging in close as he went over the rig . Russ got up on his ear . " Tell your man up there , " he said to Herman 's helper , " if he does that again I 'll reach up there and pull him down to the floor . " " Take it easy , " I said . " No use getting him sore at you . There 's some big jobs coming up . You 're going to need his help . " What we called a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limit capacity of the rig . Anything over , Russ could n't handle alone and Herman helped . A sling was wrapped round the steel and Herman let down his hook and tied on to it , easing some of the strain off the rig . Co-operation between the two had to be smooth ; it was no job for a couple of soreheads to work on together . The bell rang and Herman came down for lunch . Russ went up to him and made himself plain . " Listen here , " he said , " throw another load of steel over my head  --  and you and I are going to tangle . One of us is go . ing to the hospital . Understand ? " Herman never opened his mouth . It had some effect on him . For a few days he kept his loads in the clear , and then he began swinging them in close again . Not close enough so that Russ could get down to business and do something about it , but still close enough to make him uncomfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cot you tol ' him , " said Johnson . " He tol ' me you was givin ' him orders what to do . He do n't need two bosses . " " I did tell him , " said Russ . " Now I 'm telling you . If he drops something  --  hits me  --  do n't try to tell ' em up there it was an accident . See ? Because Bennie , here , will be there to prove what I said . " " What 's a matta ? " said Johnson , " you getting nervous or somethin ' ? For eight years he 's been slinging steel ova guys bets . He 's neva hit nobody yet . " A couple of days later Johnson lined out a job for us that looked tough right from the start . It was a piece of steel half as big as a Holt car and marked " experimental . " It was a die job and was the lower block of a set of dies that together would weigh thirty tons . They were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal the whole top and a part of the sides of the two-door car body . Getting it into the furnace was a job for both rigs . Easing it off the floor , Herman helped and took most of the strain ; Russ steadied . The eight steel lines coming down from the drums on Herman 's rig were as stiff as iron rods with the tension . Herman had most of the load ; Russ had the responsibility . Herman could raise and lower and move the load in four different directions ; Russ had control over every motion that a man has in his shoulder , elbow , and wrist . It was nice teamwork . Smooth and steady the load was raised from the floor and moved up the bay to number one furnace . And then came the ticklish job of getting the steel through the door without wrecking the furnace . Herman got into position  --  cut off his power , and went dead . " All yours , " Johnson signaled to Russ . He eased her in , his hands stroking the levers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her gently , easing her in ; there was n't one inch to spare . The front end of the steel touched the floor of the furnace . Herman dropped off and Russ gave her a clean push through the door . He pulled out . It was nice work , but the hard part  --  the work under the hammer  --  was still to come . Johnson spoke to Russ . " Betta check your rig over right afta dinner . I want everything to go extra smooth  --  see ? Once I start flattennin ' her out you 'll never get her back through that door . We got ta do it all in one heat and there 's plenty of forge work on that baby before she sta'ts freezing . " Anything that was n't red-hot to Johnson was cold . A piece of steel that did n't lick the grease off the floor was n't even warm to the touch . " I never let a job down yet , " said Russ . " Guess I wo n't this one . Better talk to Herman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? " " So far , " said Russ , All the forenoon the steel soaked in the furnace . It took up a lot of heat even before starting to turn red , and after that a lot more . We had lunch and then Russ and I worked on the machine . I swiped while he oiled and checked over camshafts and gears . His big , gentle hands slid over the journals ; the way he felt of the bearings was like a caress . " We 'll sling her up there , " he said . " We 'll twist her tail any old way the Swede says . We 'll make her behave . " About two-thirty Johnson said he was ready . We took the hooks off Herman 's crane and rigged on a sling . The big hammer was cut in on the high-pressure steam and began warming up . Johnson cleared space for action and gave Russ right-of-way on the floor . Russ put on his green goggles , sloshed water on the front of his shirt , and climbed up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold piece of steel is one thing ; a hot piece of steel is something else . Cold steel is like a wild animal that is dead ; hot steel is like one that is alive and dangerous  --  there is energy in it . Energy to make the breath stick in your throat  --  to scorch the inside of your lungs if you breathe through your mouth . Yet you have to work close or you lose control . Russ dragged the steel halfway out of the furnace and clasped on . We wrapped the sling around and , even with long irons , the job was too hot to be fun . Herman picked up his share of the load and they swung her across the floor to the hammer . A minute later they had her up on the iron and the anvil took Herman 's load . Russ had it all . Johnson 's signals were fast : " Left turn ? a little  --  lower the front end a hair  --  a bit more  --  too much  --  o-keh  --  hold her . " The hammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground trembled and an empty milk bottle that someone had left on a switch-box crashed to the floor . One end , the upper side , was beveled off , fairly smooth . A new position . " Shove her up , " Johnson signaled . Herman picked up the load for a minute ; Russ pushed her over ; once again there were signals . Russ 's eyes were on Johnson ; his hands on the levers were a sight that was beautiful to see . His shirt was steaming and the red light from the steel was on his face . Once more the hammer  --  the upper right side was beveled . Once more a quick change ; the hammer again  --  the left sidewas finished . Then Johnson signaled : " Pull her off  --  reverse end positions . " " Judast priest ! " I said , " that 's gon na make the job tough . " A string of visitors came in and lined up to watch . The guide started his spiel and began telling the crowd all about steel , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of the rig . We lowered off to the floor , switched ends and shifted Herman 's rigging while Johnson snapped some measurements with long-handled calipers and the scalers cleaned off the anvil . " Pick her up ! " Johnson signaled . And it was then Herman started his monkey business . He lit into his load with a snap . Russ lost his bite and was helpless . " What 's a maddal " Johnson bellowed . " Ca n't you fellas come up togedda ? Take it easy ! " Herman could n't have heard what he said . Russ kept his mouth shut and worked out a new hold . The job was harder for him , now ; he had the end that was beveled . There were no corners  --  no rough surfaces to bite into . " Easy now , " Johnson signaled . " Bring her up ? " This time they got her off the floor  --  were starting to raise her  --  when Herman jerked . Once more Russ lost his hold . He was beginning to get angry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Get it up there ! " he signaled . " Stop horsin ' around  --  she 's gettin ' cold ! " That time they both jerked . She slipped out of Herman 's sling and rolled to the floor . Russ slid down the ladder and went up to Johnson . " Pull him off , " he said . " Give me the floor . I ca n't work with that fellow  --  he 's trying to queer me . " " You 're crazy , " said Johnson . " You ca n't handle ' er . " " I 'll handle her , " said Russ . " Get him out-a here . I 'll shorten my boom  --  get leverage . " " And burn yourself up . " " What-a you care ? We 're losing our heat . She 's getting cold . " " 0-kelt , " said Johnson . " She 's yours ? you asked for it . " He waved Herman off the floor . Russ passed me . " Keep everybody off the track behind me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move  --  shoot in and grab  --  back out for air . Throw me a spray when I come past . " He swung up . There was action without waiting for signals from Johnson . Russ shortened his boom a full quarter . The steel lay on its side . He bit into it  --  slammed it over  --  backed away  --  came from another angle and turned it again . He was after a good hold and got it . He shortened the boom another foot . He could have spit on the steel . " What 's ' e tryin ' to do , " said Johnson , " get ' er up in his lap ? " Russ began raising the load . Slowly , it came up from the floor . The gears growled ; the motors groaned with resentment . Circuit breakers popped out with the sound of explosions and were sent back with a flash . Switches snapped and gave off little corkscrews of blue smoke . The machine responded against a gigantic resistance but you felt that it was not the electrical current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the strength , the speed , and the expert control of those powerful hands on the levers . He got it up on the anvil and the fancy work started . Johnson stepped in again and for once his signals were dear . There was no sling to worry about now no clumsy helper . Russ crouched low behind the controls . The heat must have been fierce , and when the heavy blows fell he was in the red rain of hot iron . The guide stood in line with his gang ? forgot his spiel and looked on . The scalers , better able to appreciate what they saw , stopped work and looked as hard as the others . Three times he got the steel in position ; three times the hammer battered and pounded . Then he balanced the steel on the anvil , undamped , and shot back for a breath of cool air . The paint on the forward end of the machine was beginning to blister . The oil on the open gears smoked and the steel ladder was hot to the touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the scalers threw up some gloves . " It wo n't get you nowhere , " I hollered , " if you burn yourself up . " " Do n't worry , " he said . " This time we 'll finish her off . " He rolled in again . Johnson signaled . There was a high spot near the center to work down . This time it was even more difficult to hold . It was beveled all the way round . He got it , but the first light blow of the hammer loosened it up . It was a struggle again to get the right hold and all the time the steel was up there on the anvil . He turned and tilted and once or twice it threatened to get away and slide to the floor . But he got it , and the hammer did its last work . " O-keh ? " Johnson signaled . " All done . " The crowd broke out and applauded . As I 've said , Herman , the fellow who ran the overhead crane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ceiling coasting along in his iron cage with his head sticking out , a cud in his cheek the size of a duck egg , and every once in a while sending a long , thin squirt down to the floor . He hardly ever hit anybody and almost never hit Russ 's rig , but Russwas worried . At night after work he 'd go round the machine , looking it over . " What 's that ? " he 'd say . " Looks mighty suspicious to me . " " Aw , get out , " I 'd say . " It 's a little iron rust or some water . " From day to day he worked himself up about it something fierce and nothing I said made any difference . And then one day he sent in a long complaint to the safety department , and a couple of days later a general order came through : no more tobacco chewing by crane operators while on duty . Herman was sore as a boil . He knew who was to blame . Herman took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All that afternoon he kept swinging closer and once , when Johnson was n't on the floor , he pulled one straight over the rig . Russ got up on his ear , and that night , after Herman climbed down from the crane , Russ warned him again . " I 'm telling you once more , " he said . " Keep your loads in the dear . Swing another load over my head and I 'll reach up there and pull you and your cage down to the floor so quick you wo n't know what 's happened . " " Boosh-wah , " said Herman . " Tell it to the safety committee , why doncha ? " I had a chance to talk to Herman at the tool crib . " Better take it serious , " I said . " When he gets his hands on them levers  --  he 'll do anything  --  he ai n't human . " " That 's all right , " he said . " Me  --  I 'm hot-headed too . If he wants to start something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happened . It was about three in the afternoon . Johnson was up at the desk talking to Riley . Russ had a piece of cold stuff and was getting in position to load number three . I had the air off and was raising the door when Herman came down the bay with a stack of front axle blanks , three or four tons of them . The load came down the bay in a straight line for Russ . I figured Herman was going to throw a little scare into Russ  --  figured he 'd come up close and then swing his load to the other side of the bay . But he did n't . He came straight on  --  the load swinging a little at the end of the long cables . He was close ? getting closer  --  without cutting speed . Thirty feet  --  twenty  --  coming straight over . But no . Russ dropped his load to the floor and shot backward . He stopped , raised his boom like a snake getting ready to strike , and stood his ground . Herman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the iron claw open for business , smashed into Herman 's load , and the front axle blanks clattered and rained to the floor . The racket was something terrific . Iron chips flew in every direction ; dust rose thick from the floor ; scalers and hammer men scattered . I ducked for a pillar . The fight was on . Herman rolled back and pulled his hooks up  --  got into position . Now they were empty  --  ready to hit . Russ drew in his boom . The big claw snapped open  --  aimed at the cage  --  came at Herman . But Herman struck first  --  dropped his hooks like a swinging plummet in a long curve . Itwas a good shot . He got a grappling hold on the undercarriage of the rig . He drew tight . A couple of pulls and he 'd turn the rig over . But Russ was too quick . He slashed his boom round against the steel cables and wiped himself clear . Snarling steel rope filled the air . In a wild swing Herman 's hooks struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . Somewhere a steam line let go . Noise was terrific . Herman shot back and rolled in his line  --  came in again , maneuvering for a direct overhead drop , trying to keep Russ on the defensive . But Russ went at him . He shot out his boom  --  full length  --  straight for the cage . Herman kicked hack  --  not a second too soon . Another two feet and Russ would have had him down on the floor . Herman dropped the hooks ; Russ struck as they fell and sent them spinning , and they crashed against the big hammer . But they were open and on the rebound they hit the undercarriage of the rig  --  closed up and held . Herman gave her the juice  --  all he had . His lines tightened . Once more Russ tried to slash himself clear  --  struck out . It was no good . The steel lines tightened still more . Russ swung his boom  --  raised and lowered  --  trying to cut through . Fire leaped from the cables as steel sheared on steel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise from the floor . He 'd go over ! To save himself he aimed his boom for the crane  --  shot out to full length  --  clamped onto the bridge . It held . Herman was powerless to move him . The two machines were deadlocked to a standstill . It was then I thought about throwing out the master switches like I 'm supposed to do in emergencies . Both switches were up there on the wall pillar and I cut Herman out first , and when I did , Russ settled back to the floor . And then I got busy . Fellows were running all around , looking up , still not sure whether the building would come down or not . Scalers with brick dust on their clothes began showing up on the floor looking scared . I went up to a couple . " Listen , " I said . " You fellows . I do n't care who you 're for . But if one gets fired  --  they both go . We got ta make them think it was an accident . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do some powerful lying . But what could I do ? There was Johnson and he had the two men down on the floor , and there was Riley and a whole bunch of others and they wanted to know everything . And after I got started , there was no way of changing my story  --  no place to stop ; and I got in deeper and deeper ; and I told them that the two machines had just accidentally come together , and that in trying to untangle they had got scrambled up something awful . Russ was still fighting mad , but looking at him you might have thought that he was just scared , and I was afraid that he would lay into Herman right there while I was talking , though a fist-fight , I guess , would have been pretty tame after the way they had been going at it . And there were the two machines , still standing there with death grips on each other , in what you might call a compromising position  --  axle blanks and broken bricks scattered all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnace . If Johnson or Riley had had a lick of sense in their heads they would n't have had to ask any question , but what it came down to , I guess , is what 1 told Russ , They just could n't imagine that there would ever be two fellows so dumb and hot-headed that they would try to run off a fight with a bridge crane and a manipulator . The pow-wow ended up with me getting it in the neck from Johnson . " When you saw what was happening , " he said , " why'n-cha do sumpt'ing ? Why'ncha Crow out the switch right away , ' stead of standin ' there with your hands in your pockets ? " One day in May , when times were bad in Detroit , Johnson called Russ and me over and gave us a couple of slips . " Take these , " he said , " and go up to the transfer department and see if ya can get yaself a couple new jobs . I ca n't use ya no more . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's nottin ' the matta , " said Johnson . " It 's just what I 'm tellin ' ya  --  I ca n't use ya no more . " " Why not ? " " ' Cause 1 ca n't , We got a new way figured out for making dies . We ai n't gon na forge ' em no more . " Johnson was fooling round with some blueprints  --  filing some away  --  throwing some in the can . " Who 's gon na run the rig ? " asked Russ . " Nobody . " " What 's gon na happen to it ? " " They 'll feed it to the open-hearths . Melt it up and make some new Halts . In a couple days you 'll see it standin ' out there in the bone-yard . The big hammer goes too . No more poundin ' and bangin ' . It ai n't civilized to make dies like that . " " Ai n't civilized ? How are you gon na make dies if you do n't forge them ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Type them ? " " That 's what I said . " " It sounds crazy . " " Might be it sounds crazy to you . " Johnson went on with his work . " But why junk the rig ? " " It 's obsolete , I ya . Odda companies use old-fashion tools . We ca n't afford to . " " Then why not sell it ? " " Because the Holt Motor Company ai n't in the second-hand business . " Johnson put on his coat . " Betta get going , " he said . " They 'll be closin ' up . " Then he left . I had to wash up and when I got back to the floor Russ was fooling with the rig . He had a piece of rag in his hand  --  too small to do any good  --  and pretended to be swiping . " Do n't wait for me , " he said . " I 'll be along later . " But I did n't go and while waiting for him I went over some old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others ; and while doing this , I watched him , and what he was doing was sort of saying farewell to the rig . His big hands curved over the brasses , his fingers touching and feeling  --  the tips of his fingers sensing the feel of the metal that was still warm from the heat of the day 's work . Along the smooth shafts his hands slid , gentle and yet strong in their motions , firm and gentle , flowing along the warm steel . He climbed to the controls and let his hands flow over the levers ? levers that his hands knew so well ; touching each one  --  sliding his hands along the smooth metal  --  feeling them  --  understanding them with the tips of his fingers . And then down again , reaching a hand intimately into a nest of warm gears , leaning the while against the base of the machine , one hand exploring and touching , the other hand pressed against the bare , unpainted steel . " Come on , " I said . " Let 's beat it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we do n't get a move on . " He came out of it then , and we left .
