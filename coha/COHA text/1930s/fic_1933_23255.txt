DUTCHY SCHMIDT A STORY BY GEORGE DAVIS I WAS lying on the parlor floor when 1 Mrs. Phelps , our next-door neighbor , ran to the back stoop to tell my mother that Dutchy Schmidt had just died . I heard Mrs. Phelps ' strident call , " Oh , Mrs. Travis ! " , my mother 's quick flight from the dining room to the kitchen , then silence . I understood : my mother had gone over to Mrs. Phelps ' to hear the story . She was afraid that Mrs. Phelps might spout a version of it too brutal for my ears . She must think up some gentle way to break the news to me . But I knew . What else would have brought Mrs. Phelps running to our back door that scorcher of a July afternoon ? From moment to moment Dutchy 's death had been expected ; the town had scarcely breathed for twenty-four hours . In spite of the heat the men had donned their good suits and were using one excuse or another to hang round Main Street ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their favorite rockers , fanning themselves with cardboard fans given away by Harben 's Grocery . Doc Carter had told the boys it could only be a matter of minutes . With Mrs. Phelps ' half exultant " Oh , Mrs. Travis ! " ? I knew . Dutchy was dead . I continued to play with my marbles . I had invented a game with them . The parlor floor was a kingdom , the marbles the inhabitants of that kingdom ; two giant steel ball bearings Ihad crowned king and queen , and some thirty-odd glass " puries " served as a rebellious nobility . There were revolutions and civil wars ; troops sent careering through the countryside in my mechanical train ; paper houses bombed : everything which an imagination fed on movie serials could devise happened  --  again and again . I spent hours thus  --  much to the disgust of my brothers and to the concern of my mother , who kept insisting that a great big boy like me should be chasing around outdoors . But the game was new and enthralling ; Cowboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , straining " purey " - princes through fingers stiffened by excitement . I waited . Wickedly . I should n't be having a good time , knowing about Dutchy . " George dear . . " My heart pounded though I kept my expression calm and indifferent . Knowing was n't the same as hearing about Dutchy . And I hated it that my mother should be telling me , though she only said " Poor Dutchy is gone " with wonderful quietness , and held a tiny blue handkerchief to her eyes and cried . She was crying because it was terrible that any boy had to die . My mother loves boys more than anything else in the world . And now Dutchy Schmidt was lying dead with a hole driven through his belly by the hoof of John Wieck 's mare Jenny . By and by my mother stopped dabbing at her eyes with her handkerchief . Her hands Jay still in her lap . 1 was afraid of the noise the marbles would make if I put them in their box , so I left them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up until after Dutchy 's funeral . And there was somewhere I had to go this very moment . Somewhere I did n't think my mother would want me to go . Maybe that 's another reason why I did n't pick up the marbles : if I had , my mother would have known I was going out and asked me not to . was n't taking any chances . Instead of leaving by the front door , I walked through the hall , the dining room , and the kitchen , then stealthily opened the screen door and galloped down the back stoop and away . A group of four or five men and about ten boys had beaten me to it . None of them had the nerve to trespass on John Wieck 's property , so they stood in a straggly line on the sidewalk , staring sometimes at the house , sometimes at the barn . Both buildings had taken on ( it seemed ) a sinister look . The blinds were drawn upstairs and down in the house , and we could make out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No sign of life . Even the chickens had been shut in their coop . John Wieck was a retired farmer , seventy anyway and perhaps older . He was said to be rolling in money , and certainly was stingier than all get out . He used to rant and rave about the school taxes . His daughter Anna was over forty and had never been to school . As a matter of fact , it was hard to tell Anna from her mother ; both looked as if they had been left out in the rain : pinkish eyes , yellowish hair tied in unkempt knots , brownish dresses for Sunday , mother hubbards for weekdays , and both with what my brother Wilber calls " Themilk-pail slouch . " John Wieck lorded it over them , of course ; off the farm and here in Ayton , they were still working their fingers to the bone . As for John , rheumatism had crippled him up pretty much ; he needed two canes when he walked . That was why he had hired poor Dutchy Schmidt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anna and her mother cleaned the chicken coop , but even old John saw some difference between farm and town living : he could n't let his womenfolk pitch manure with neighbors looking on . Besides , Dutchy had cost him only fifty cents a week  --  more than John cared to part with ; still , anybody else would have wanted at least a dollar for the job . None of us on the sidewalk had ever paid any particular attention to that gray barn before . How we gaped nowt It just did n't seem possible that Dutchy Schmidt was soon going to lie rotting in his grave because yesterday afternoon he had given John Wieck 's mare Jenny a little jab with the handle of his pitchfork Or so old John claimed . Not a little jab , either , he had told Doc Carter , but a real hard one . He had made Doc go out to the barn with him and had shown him a mark on Jenny 's flank , swearing that it was the mark of Dutchy 's pitchfork . Doc had promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make marks like that , John Wieck , " Doc had added , " and if you have a spark of decency in that old hide of yours , you 'll do what every man , woman and child in this town expects you to do  --  take that damned mare out and shoot her . " John had muttered that he 'd see the town in hell first . " Oh , you will , will you , you old penny-hoarding bastard , " Doc had shouted . " By Christ , we 'll see about that ! As soon as Dutchy kicks off ? ! " Anti with that he strode out , the way Doc Carter could stride when he was sore about something . Mel Jackson was the one telling us all this , Mel , the laziest man in Ayton , who got up every morning at five so he could have a longer day in which to loaf . Well , the chances were that Doc Carter had sailed into old John in some such fashion  --  knowing John and knowing the Doc . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson shook his fist at the Wieck house . " Dirty German murderer , " he said , with almost the effect of loudness . " If you do n't shoot that damned mare of yours , we 'll shoot it for you . " Somebody suggested that we wait until dark , then set fire to the barn . Teach those dirty Germans a lesson . ( The War was still a few months off , but anti-German feeling was already running high . ) In the house there , hiding behind his women 's skirts . Yahl This was fun for a while , but too transparently smoke without fire to keep up forever . We kids were longing for rough stuff , but knew better than to count on Mel and his pals for it , " Pool-room riff-raff " ? my mother 's never failing description of them  --  without even the gumption to play pool . If this was the best they could do  --  f And indeed it was , minus the say-so of Ayton 's more substantial citizens . A retreat toward Main Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : fierce backward looks , piping promises of future vengeance . Mel and his pals stalked ; we kids swelled with pride . Was n't one of us responsible for all this grim agitation ? Why , Dutchy had sat in the seat next to mine at school ! We turned into Main Street . Our little mob split up , Mel flopping into a chair under the Aytonian Hotel awning , Stu and Fred Brown joining the boys at Turner 's Garage , and we kids tagging back and forth . The 5:10 hadjust come in with the Detroit papers announcing a great Allied victory . We wished we could rub old John 's nose in an account of it , the dirty Hun . ( We had forgotten about Dutchy being German too . ) Everybody was wishing Doc Carter would show up , but he did n't . The talk began to languish a bit . It was getting near suppertime , and the impression appeared to be becoming general that a recess would n't be a bad idea . Nevertheless , I lingered on among the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drama . And I was richly rewarded : even as I reluctantly made up my mind that I must drag myself home or else miss supper , Mel Jackson came out of the silence with a thunderbolt : " Yes . . . and when Doc was leaving , after giving John the old Harry , John yelled after him that all this trouble came from his hiring the son of a dirty low-down whore . That 's what he called Belle Schmidt . " I do n't know whether John Wieck did call Belle Schmidt that , or whether Mel Jackson made it up to shock and delight the rapidly melting band in front of the Aytonian . If Mel made it up , it was proof that he possessed talent for something besides loafing . Belle Schmidt 's shame had been named , had taken its rightful place in our consideration of the tragedy . Belle Schmidt fascinated even as she repelled me . Is n't that the traditional thing for Bad Women to do ? Because Belle Schmidt was Ayton 's Bad Woman . Our one authentic Jezebel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pretty . A sawed-off . Dark and dumpy comes near to describing her . A mustache , swollen ankles . She painted  --  I wonder , does she still ? ? her face an angry red , as if defiance were the thing , not coquetry . Her way with men was anything but flirtatious ; she was more apt to snarl at them than smile . But she got them  --  that is to say , she got Charley Benham , Buck , Schliemeyer and Amos Harveyl  --  and , in addition , an occasional drummer and tramp mill-worker . If any other men slipped into her lair under cover of darkness they were damned cunning about it . Belle 's father had been a nice old man with a white beard  --  too short to look like God , but acceptable as , oh , a very minor prophet , though obviously he was n't much in the prophesying line : used to love to gab about what a good girl Belle was . After she 'd up and gone he learned what a fool he had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month at the post office , just to show folks how he felt about hearing from Belle . At that , she never dropped him a line . After five years she came back  --  she 'd been ? living in Toledo , the town was given to understand ; and she brought with her a monkey and a baby . Also , she said her name was no longer Belle Froelich ; it was Mrs. Belle Schmidt . Old man Froelich would n't open his mouth to her , but found it in his heart to give her and her traveling circus house-room . The monkey was installed in the empty chicken run , and the baby  --  well , there was no killing Dutdiyl I mean , that 's what Ayton used to say . . . . Well , the monkey died , and shortly afterward old man Froelich died . Belle and Dutchy were left alone in the world . Dutchy 's father never showed up . People had their suspicions about the Mrs. part of Belle 's name . Let them ! was Belle 's attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she felt like whipping Dutchy until his bellowing had the neighbors holding their ears , that was her business too . Did n't he flourish on it ? At twelve he looked sixteen  --  moonfaced , rosy , a good six inches taller than Belie . Not too tall for her to whack , though . Lea therthonged whip she had . Dutchy got a taste of it when he did n't mind his Fs and Q 's  --  yes , and sometimes when he did . Belle was a devil . Decent townsfolk , especially the women , thought Belle should be locked up until she learned how to behave . Some went as far as to say that a taste of the lash would n't hurt her . The sheriff did give her a real talking-to a couple of times . But Belle was Belle , and what was to be done about it ? She was a Bad Woman , and as such she must at last face her Maker . Even I , a brat of twelve , appreciated that . It seemed safe to enjoy wholeheartedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to . Where , on the other hand , did I  --  and the other kids  --  get off in this present crisis ? Dutchy 's battered corpse had yet to be disposed of : that meant a regular funeral ; it must even if his mother was Belle Schmidt . And a funeral meant a minister , and it also meant mourners ; mourners meant " friends of the dead person " ; " friends of the dead person " meant me . Me and the sixth grade anyway . Were our parents going to let us see the inside of Belle Schmidt 's house even for such a solemn occasion as Dutchy 's funeral ? No getting round it , Belle was every bit what Mel Jackson said John Wieck said she was . Were , then , our parents going to let their children enter the House of Sin ? That was what little George was all a-dither to find outl The Travis family were sitting down to supper as I hustled in . All except my oldest brother , Harold , who was visiting in Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His gaze was vague and troubled . He waited until we were settled , then lowered his head and began : " Dear Father , we thank Thee ? " This was unusual : my father 's cus-torn was to say grace only for our Sunday dinner or when we had company . I listened uneasily now to the familiar words , heard my father 's voice tremble with some deep emotion , chanced a veiled glance upward , to see tears glistening in my mother 's eyes . What was the matter ? Then in a Rash I understood : this prayer of thanks was being offered humbly to God because Harold , Norman , Wilber , Frank , and George Travis were , just as Dutchy Schmidt was no longer . A complete absence of play-acting , of it-takes-a-heap-o ' - livin ' hogwash . Simply , there we were , the Travis gang , as unlike one to the other as brothers can well be , but somehow held together , as we still are , by a common tie : the loving-kindness of our father and mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Straightening with the amen of the grace , I saw that the faces of my brothers were set and stern . The moment passed . My father served us our steak and mashed potatoes , and we dived in . Nothing wrong with our appetites ever . Only my mother picked spiritlessly at her food . And yet something was in the air ; something which tightened the customary silence . The bread pudding had been reached before Norman came out with what he must have had in his mind all along : " 1 heard at the post office that Mel Jackson and Stu and Fred Brown were up in front of John Wieck 's this afternoon with a lot of half-witted kids , making a hell of a racket and saying they were going to burn John 's stable down because of Dutchy . Had Anna and her mother scared out of their pants . If John had any guts he 'd have shot them full of rock salt . " I got whom the dig was intended for . To this day Norman never comes right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted exactly right , " said my father . " What have those hoodlums to do with the affair anyway ? It would only have made matters worse to pay any attention to them . I 've been talking with John  --  he called me in  --  and he wants to pay Dutchy 's funeral expenses and give Belle a thousand dollars besides . I do n't see what more he can do . A thousand dollars ca n't bring Dutchy back to life , but it 's a lot of money for Belle . And how did she treat Dutchy when she had him ? I 'm not sure that he is n't better off dead than alive . " " Do n't say that , Rob , " said my mother . I excused myself from the table before my mother brought in the tea front the kitchen , and sat in the morris chair by the window . It would soon be getting dark . Well , I could walk as far as Main Street anyway . . . see if any of the kids were hanging around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go along with me , find out if Belle Schmidt had put black crape on the door for Dutchy . . . . No I could n't . Not after Norman blabbing that about " a lot of halfwitted kids .. . scaring the pants off Anna and her mother . " I had to stay where 1 was . Could n't even cross the street for a little while to help Jack Boyle finish building his Meccano derrick . I was an outcast  --  and all because my father was Doctor Travis and not Doc Carter . The one time in my life I had a friend die from being kicked in the belly by a horse the friend had to be a patient of Doc Carter 's and the horse had to belong to a patient of my father 's . That 's the way it always was . Yes , and always would be . As long as 1 lived the Travises would always be on the wrong side  --  the sissy side . Why did my father always have to have patients like the Wiecks ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he did n't like Belle Schmidt and Dutchy . He did n't care a lift of his finger whether he ruined my life or not . All my friends would be going to Dutchy 's funeral , seeing him lying in his coffin , seeing the inside of Belle Schmidt 's house . I 'd be the only one left out . And why ? Because my father was Doctor Travis . Because I was George Travis . If only I could change names with any other boy in Aytonl It was n't my fault I was George Travis . I knew , I knew whose fault it was : those people behind me . They hated me . They were plotting this very minute to keep me from going to Dutchy 's funeral . Well , I could hate back ! I was n't afraid to say it : I hate my father and my mother and the whole Travis family , I hate my father and my mother " But George must go , Norman . And I must take him . You do n't have to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good or bad , she was his mother , and for all we know , may be crying her eyes out , wishing she had it to do over again . No , I must go and George must go . Please . " My mother had spoken . Her " Please " was enough . The family pushed back from the table . Frank helped my mother clear the dishes and wash them , my father and Wilber and Norman settled down to reading the War news . Dutchy was mentioned no more that evening . I went out to the side porch and curled up in the swing . Usually I pushed it from time to time , less for the movement than for the creaking of the chains , but to-night I held it still . I was feeling humbled , horribly ashamed . Yes , in danger of eternal damnation . Oh , why was it , when one moment I loved my parents and my brothers the way the prayer told me I should , the very next I was hating them with all the breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the demon who had marked me from the first as evil and his own ? The afternoon of Dutchy 's funeral was the worst scorcher of the year . The leaves on our maples drooped , the rambler roses against the woodshed dully released their warm pink petals . There was no escaping the sun . The services were to be at four , but the members of the Boys ' Class of the Congregational Sunday School were supposed to be at the Schmidt house no later than three-thirty . Dutchy had enrolled only two weeks before , so that he might go along on the Congregational picnic at Pearl Lake , an event which always took place the firstweek in August . Dutchy had been doing that every summer , then dropping out a couple of weeks after the picnic , showing up again at Christmas . On his own hook , of course ; nobody had ever run after him . But neither had anybody tried to keep him out  --  not that anybody had been fool enough to believe for one moment that Dutchy had suddenly got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday School than lots of places he might have gone ( home , for instance ! ) . Oh , a couple of old hens did set up a squawk every time he had re-appeared , complaining that repentance for the error of hisways had n't returned him to our midst , and that because of  --  well , they were too self-respecting to say it  --  his presence in the Sunday School was a menace to the morals of our young people . But every year they had been talked down ? though it took some doing ! ? by Reverend Trask and the more liberal church members . They argued that Belle Schmidt being a Bad Woman did n't necessarily make Dutchy a Bad Boy . Only an Unfortunate Boy . . . My father would n't let my mother wear black , so she had no black dress for the funeral . It did n't matter , really ; her dark blue one would do just as well . Very few people bothered about black now , even when the death was in their own family . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the way one felt inside . It was n't hard to see that my mother felt awfully sad inside . She went upstairs right after dinner , and did n't come down until three . I was ready ? Sunday suit , and shoes freshly polished  --  by one , anxious to be present at the pow-wow of the Travis men in the woodshed . " Ready , son ? " said my father . He was sitting on the sawhorse and humming contentedly to himself . The expression on his face was grave , as usual : but the humming gave him away . Dear dad ; it was n't in him to feel downcast on a day when a patient of Doc Carter 's was to be buried . He was n't spiteful : simply , his opinion of Doc 's gifts as a doctor was anything but high , so on days like this he hummed . I nodded yes to the question and took my place on a pile of newspapers . My brothers gave me a brief ironical stare , which I accepted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Travis and attending the funeral of one of Doc Carter 's patients ? Was n't I their youngest brother and about to walk in the front door of Belle Schmidt 's ? Yes , they had the right to look at me like that . " All dressed up and rarin ' to go , " said Norman . They laughed . I managed a sickly smite , to hide the sharp spasm of rage which leaped within me . Norman was the worst , but the others were always ready to laugh at his jibes . I had it on them this time though . I was going to Dutchy 's funeral and they were n't . So there , the old fools . After a moment , they went on with their talk . Frank had heard that Mrs. Thomas , the teacher of my Sunday School class , was sick in bed and would n't be able to go to the funeral . Funny , my father was the Thomases ' doctor , and they had n't called him in . Funny , in a pig 's eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schmidt 's house of her own free will the sky would rain little fishes . Only she did n't have the nerve to tell Rev. Trask where to get off . Not like old Aggie Hepburn , who was threatening to move over to the Methodist Church . No doubt about it , the Rev. was taking a terrific chance on the die-hards kicking up a stink about the whole business . Bunny Flanner 's mother had announced in the post office yesterday that Bunny would not be among those present at Dutchy 's funeral ; she had always forbidden him to play with Dutchy when he was alive , and she saw no reason to act like a hypocrite now that he was dead . Good riddance of bad rubbish ! said Mrs. James C. Flanner . " If it were anybody but that she-rat and her rat-son ? " said Wilber . " Why , Dutchy was a prize beside that nitwit . And give me Belle any day ! " " How about to-morrow ? " said Norman . " Or I guess that 's Buck Schliemeyer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week 's vacation , " said Wilber . " She 's been needing it for a long time , and Dutchy 's just given her a good excuse . " " Boys , boys , " said my father , out of his humming . He meant a little that they should n't be talking that way , but more that they should n't be talking that way in front of me . They grinned . I pretended to be deaf , dumb , and blind . They were n't going to get my goat this time . Let them make fun of Belle and joke about Bunny 's old fool mother not letting him go to the funeral : I was going , and they were jealous . Now they were kidding about the coffin Belle had picked out for Dutchy  --  how fancy it was , with white satin inside . " Boy , I 'll bet Dutchy looks sweet ! " said Wilber , and they grinned again . Before my mother came downstairs they were pretty well agreed that the trouble at the church would probably blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , and everybody knew it . Rev. Trask was a fine fellow , popular all the way around , and , whatever people said now , afterward they would be glad that Dutchy had been done right by . As for Belle ? no need to worry about her taking advantage of any chance to get chummy with our respectable Ayton ladies . They could fire ahead just as though Belle were n't there . Mrs. Trask would set the example for them , of course  --  and a funeral 's a funeral . Well , to-night Dutchy would be lying in the cold , cold ground , and Ayton would be going its way and Belle hers . Back to her true-blue boy friends . Nothing would be changed in Ayton , absolutely nothing . That decided , the Travis men filed out of the woodshed and into the kitchen . My mother was waiting . Nothing changed in Ayton ? A fat lot they knew about itl . . . Walking with my mother to Belle Schmidt 's house  --  and we walked slowly , on the shady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my mother was n't strong , and anyway it is n't nice to hurry to a funeral  --  I was awed by my knowledge of how much would be changed in Ayton by Dutchy 's death . What exactly ? I was n't sure , but lots . Even if Dutchy had just died like anybody else , that would have been something , but to have been killed  --  I People ca n't be killed without its making a whale of a difference to everybody concerned . That was why the War was important : people were n't dying ; they were being killed . Like Dutchy . And my brothers could n't say that nothing was changed , because I was changed . I did n't know how , but I was . Then , as my mother and I turned the corner which brought the Schmidthouse into full view , as we blinked at familiar figures unfamiliar on its porch , most of all as we tried not to see Ed Chester 's black hearse out there in the road , I knew what was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death  --  Dutchy himself . After to-day , we were n't ever going to see Dutchy again . Dutchy was n't ever going to see us again . I was sick and scared , but it could n't help any . Dutchy was no more . I dared look up after Reverend Trask began to speak . It was his voice , I think , half way between his church and his Boy Scouts ' meeting voice , not too high and mighty sounding , which gave me courage . There were only five of us from the Boys ' Class of the Sunday School . Bunny Flanner had n't come naturally , and Gene and John Kornman were missing , though they had a good excuse , living four miles out in the country . Mrs. Thomas was , as rumored , being sick at home . I was sitting between Everett Stocking and Allen Jessup , and on the other side of Allen were Merle Lynd , Bugs Sawyer , and Phil MacLean . We had been told that we were the honorary pallbearers , and were herded into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our parents . In the entrance to the parlor , bald head bowed , stood Ed Chester , Ayton 's one furniture dealer and undertaker ; occasionally he would look out the front door to sec if Jake Dill , his assistant , was on guard beside the hearse . Belle 's neighbors had turned out nobly , filling up the sides and back of the parlor and overflowing into the dining room . Mrs. Trask  --  I could n't see her , because she was presiding over the Congregational group , where my mother was ; but she would still be wearing the expression which she had fastened to her face before leaving the parsonage . / had recognized it , guiltily , when she came in as the one of her three expressions my brothers had named " Christian Charity . " Mrs. Trask worked hard at being a real helpmeet to Reverend Trask . " To these young boys sitting before me , it is a source of grief to have lost a dear comrade . To Franklin Schmidt 's loving mother ? " On flowed the consoling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard him say " To Franklin Schmidt 's loving mother ? " Had anybody else heard ? Because that must mean Belle . Franklin Schmidt was Dutchy all right , crazy as it sounded . " To Franklin Schmidt 's loving mother ? " and no shattering sign of protest , neither from the earth below nor the Lot d on High . It could not be  --  and yet it was , with all of us in the parlor part of the plot to say that it was . It seemed thousands of years ago that I had heard Mel Jackson repeat what old John Wieck had called Belle . A dirty lowdown  --  no , no , I must n't even let the word into my head nowt It would put a curse on me . I must thing Loving Mo'ther . . . lov'ing mo'ther ... havting mo'ther . . . all the while with the picture of what Belle Schmidt must be looking like driving spang between each syllable . Squat , hairy , painted , just as she always was , not a tear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the seat next to her ? " to keep her from hollering if the spirit moves her , " I had heard him confide to Ed Chester before the service ; and on the other side , of all people , her boy friend Amos Harvey , who had slunk in without speaking to anybody , even Belle . I had caught indignant looks passing between some of the ladies at the sight of Amos . Still , Amos had his own money and could do what he pleased ; it was n't the same with Charley Benham and Buck Schliemeyer . So here he was at Dutchy 's funeral , glum , squinty , and stubborn . Maybe he was going to catch it from Doc Carter later , but until then " If Franklin will never know the joys and privileges of man 's estate , neither will he know its sorrows and penalties . He has left our midst before tasting the disappointments and disillusionments maturity oft brings ? " Dutchy up there in his coffin . Flowers heaped round him  --  white and red roses , mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crushing funeral smell . I had and had n't wanted to look at Dutchy , but Ed Chester had pushed us forward , the honorary pallbearers , so there had been nothing for me to do but look . Mrs. Jessup was saying to my mother how peaceful Dutchy looked . I could n't look at his face ; it was like the faces of the wax dummies at the County Fair . The Death of General Custer . His hands , though , were the same as Dutchy 's hands had always been , big and rough . Dutchy had n't been afraid of work . Only , Belle had put a gold signet ring on the middle finger of his right hand , and his thick silver watch in the palm of his left hand , with the silver chain and fob spread out on his blue serge suit . That watch had been Dutchy 's chief treasure ; it had belonged to his grandfather Froelich and had been brought from the Old Country , Dutchy used to boast . And now it was going into the grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coffin Belle had picked out , but then I had n't seen many coffins , except piled in Ed Chester 's storeroom . This one looked as though it had cost a lot of money . Well , John Wieck was going to pay for it , and he was going to give Belle a thousand dollars besides . Not to mention his promise to sell his mare Jenny to the first tribe of gypsies which passed through Ayton ( the Fate Worse than Death for horses in those days ) . Then Belle putting the ring and the watch in with Dutchy as well . Yes , the parents of us other kids talked about how they loved us , but I bet none of us would cost as much to bury as Dutchy had . My watch was only a dollar Ingersoll . I was wondering how much it would cost my father if some day I should be lying in a coffin like that " Let us pray . " We bowed our heads all over again . Rev. Trask prayed . A little breeze poked through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers , and the sweat on our faces felt clammy but alive . Dutchy would n't be sweating up there . Rev. Trask said " Amen , " and there was a rustle and a craning of necks . Mrs. Jessup and Mrs. Farmer rose to their feet , blushing , and murmuring " I 'm sorry " right and left , got to the piano . Mrs. Farmer sat down on the brown plush stool . Mrs. Jessup twitched for a moment , then began to sing , Mrs. Farmer accompanying her . " Safely , safely gathered in , Far from sorrow , far from sin ? " My , had Mrs. Jessup picked out that hymn with its " far from sin " line as a kind of dig at Belle ? Or was it my own dirty mind which made me think such a thing ? I looked from the corner of my eyes at Allen Jessup beside me and noticed that he was smirking with pride at having his mother showing off up there . I could n't hide from myself the envy I felt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother had sung at Dutchy 's funeral , the dummy . " God has saved from weary strife , In its dawn , this fresh young life . Now it waits for us above ? " I did n't care . Dutchy had been a closer friend to me than he 'd been to Allen , and I could prove it . Why , last winter Dutchy and I had taken our sleds together to the grist-mill to getcorncobs to sell as fuel ; I had held the gunny-sacks open , and he had dragged them out full of cobs to the sleds . Yes , and I was the only kid in Ayton he 'd told about his mother hitting Buck Schliemeyer with a poker one night . And lots more , too . Only , I knew how to keep my mouth shut , which was more than Allen Jessup did . " Yes , I shall see Him face to face , And be with those I love once more ? " Mrs. Jessup 's warhorse , that hymn ; she made her voice even shakier than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her now though . They were sneaking last looks round the parlor , because of course they would never put their feet into it again . I was wondering if I was the only person there disappointed in it . I had n't hadvery definite ideasabout whata Bad Woman 's house would be like , but Belle 's house here did n't begin to fulfil them . Though maybe she had taken down some pictures for the funeral . Dutchy himself had once told me that his mother had a picture of a naked woman reading a book . But this afternoon Belle 's parlor did n't seem different from anybody 's parlor ? except of course for Dutchy 's coffin and the flowers and us as mourners . On the wall near the front door was the match-holder Dutchy had made in manual training while I was making my tie-rack  --  a big cat in sandpaper and a little cat in plain black paper , and DO N'T SCRATCH ME SCRATCH MOTHER burnt in the wood base . Two ragged and dusty peacock feathers were crossed above a calendar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peacock feathers in our parlor  --  but it takes more than a couple of old peacock feathers to turn an ordinary house into a House of Sin . At least I could n't help thinking so . Rev. Trask was saying the words which meant that in a minute we would be finished here in Belle 's parlor . Forever . I had a gone feeling in my stomach , but only partly because of the dead Dutchy up there . Dear Holy Ghost , forgive me my wickedness , but . . . I had so wanted Dutchy 's funeral to be worthy of the son of Ayton 's one Bad Woman . The services were over . People were getting to their feet , and Ed Chester had left the doorway and was asking the pallbearers to come forward . Not us of the Boys ' Class : we were honorary pallbearers and did n't count . I almost wished my father had n't let me and my mother come . If we had just given out that the Travises had to side with John Wieck  --  but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened . I heard Mrs. Jessup whisper loudly to my mother what a blessing Doc Carter had had the good sense to have Belle 's hounds taken away for the day , so that there had been none of their outlandish howling . Why , it would have been perfectly safe for Anna Wieck and her mother to have been here  --  it was no fault of their own they had n't come , but they had been afraid Belle might- " Dutchy ! Dutchy , my baby , they ca n't take you from me ! " Suddenly Belle was screaming . People were staring at her and still she was screaming . Doc Carter grabbed her arm , but she twisted away from him and plunged toward Dutchy 's coffin . The men surrounding it let her through with funny frozen twists to their bodies . Then Belle was leaning over Dutchy . " They ca n't take you , Dutchy , do you hear ? That 's what they 're here for , but they ca n't . I 've been a bad mother , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back ? " " Please , Mrs. Schmidt ? " from Rev. Trask . " Belle ! " shouted Doc Carter . " Snap out of it ! " He had caught up to her , was trying to lead her away . Amos Harvey had n't budged , but Doc was red with anger . He thought Belle was a son of a bitch to ruin the funeral like this . Rev. Trask 's hands were in the air . Ed Chester was holding the lid of the coffin . There was a wild rush of silence . Belle reached into the coffin and pulled out Dutchy 's silver watch , the chain and fob dangling between her pudgy fingers . We were smiling with horror . It 's an awful thing to " Take hint . Take my Dutchy . " She was n't saying it to us , she was saying it to the watch . " I do n't care . I do n't . I do n't care . " She wound the watch and put it back in Dutchy 's hand . She let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ed Chester and the men put the lid on the coffin . Dutchy and his ticking watch were carried to the hearse.
