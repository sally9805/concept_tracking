txt Such Is Fame ! By Telegraph to the Editor of TOE Narr Yong Maga . OGDEN , Utah , April ** fickleness of the crowd was in evidence in this little Utah city today . Ex-President Herbert Hoover got off his train here yesterday and with his secretary sauntered up the street . They spent some time looking into a junk-store window at an old picture , a fisher-boat scene . This morning 's Salt Lake Tribune carried a front-page story of the former President 's visit and his admiration of the fishing scene and described the picture at great length . I felt certain there would be queues of politicians trying to buy it today , so in whimsical curiosity I sauntered by the store . The picture Was still there no one was even looking at it . Having lectured at a college near by , I purposely passed the store at 3 P. M. There it was still . I asked a little old man in the store how much they were asking for it . He shrugged his shoulders and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits . " Ah , me ! Capt . GYPSY ( PAT ) SMITH .
