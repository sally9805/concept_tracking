In two ways last week Cuba showed her present glowing affection for the U. S. of Good Neighbor Franklin D. Roosevelt . Signed by President Federico Laredo Bru was a bill making July 4 an official holiday for all commercial , industrial , governmental activity . Moved in the Cuban Senate by Liberal Senator Manuel Capestany was a proposal to confer upon Good Neighbor Roosevelt the title of " Eminent Citizen of America " in honor of his " historical role in the defense of democratic principles . " For Cuba 's Fourth there were fireworks , concerts , a banquet for U.S. Ambassador J. Butler Wright , a parade and a National Theatre mass meeting in honor of the U.S. attended by President Laredo Bru and Strong Man Colonel Fulgencio Batista . Well might Cuba honor Eminent Citizen Roosevelt 's Administration who in 1934 signed a reciprocal trade treaty which lowered the duty on Cuban sugar , helped to restore Cuba 's market for her main crop .                    @
