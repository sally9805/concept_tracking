IT is no new thing for me to admire the plays of S. N. Behrman . Ever since the Theater Guild produced his " Second Man " some six years ago he has seemed to me not only to be one of the most talented of our playwi ights but to stand for something quite individual and definite . Comedies  --  so called  --  we have in abundance . Wit and shrewdness are fairly common , and , indeed , they are so much in the air that otherwise quite mediocre writers seem sometimes able merely to absorb them , as it were , from the general atmosphere . But comedy , in the sense of a definite philosophy of life in whose terms the events of a play are consistently interpreted , is extremely rare . It implies , of course , far more than merely a sense of fun . It implies the willingness and the power to see all of life in a certain way , and it is just this which Mr. Behrman possesses . Quite unequivocally he takes his stand on the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grace . The passions concern him only as something to he analyzed and understood , never as something to be shared , and it is because of that fact that he achieves true comedy . Life , his say , can be interpreted in this way . Life can also be i exactly the same way . Those who think their way , it achieve grace and a kind of peace . Those who i.o accept what good sense makes plain become grotesque and tortured . It is unreason and perhaps unreason alone which can make men sublime , but it is doubtful if sublimity is worth the price one must pay . Brief moments of ecstasy may well be surrendered in exchange for the detachment , the security , and that sense of mastery which understanding can give . Men can not be great , or just , or heroic ; they can be amiable , graceful , and intelligent . Not , I think , since his first work have any of Mr. Behrman 's plays exhibited his characteristic qualities so satisfactorily as they are exhibited in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds the interest of the spectator from the first scene to the last and can hardly fail to command the respect of even those whose temperaments are most alien to its spirit . Ostensibly the story is concerned with the conflict of character between i woman of the world and two men who cross her orbit  --  one : t rising politician of the conventional type , the other a valuable but frustrated revolutionary who despises the aloofness of the heroine almost as intensely as he despises the hypocrisy of hisadversary . But though the story is told ( as the story of a comedy must be ) in terms of these individuals , it implies as much as one cares to print . The three leading figures represent the contemporary embodiment of three possible attitudes toward the world . One is the eternal idealist , one the eternal opportun , st , and the other that rarer but still eternal thing , the individual who is content with a tolerant personal integrity because he does not believe that the issue between the other two can ever be fought out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this play it is the individualist who is left in possession of the field . The two men go their ways , and one knows that they , or at least the things they stand for , will meet many times again . But one knows , too , that the spectator will also be there , and it is to a defense of the virtues of the spectator that the whole is really devoted . " Biography " is not actually a very merry play . It seldom bubbles as , for example , the same author 's " Brief 1/foment " did almost continuously . But it is , on the other hand , firm and sinewy , intelligent and sincere . Possibly no piece which has neither the hilarity of farce , the tension of melodrama , nor the sentiment of what is ordinarily called comedy can achieve the widest kind of popularity . But " Biography " will prove a delight to all who can appreciate the clarity of real intelligence , and the Theater Guild is to be congratulated for producing admirably one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting falls upon Ina Claire , who plays the woman of the world with superbly effective restraint , and Earle Larimore , who also does well with the probably more difficult role of the young idealist . " Alice in Wonderland " ( Civic Repertory Theater ) is another performance which ought not to be missed . With infinite ingenuity Miss Le Gallienne has translated nearly every one of Alice 's adventures to the stage , and so preserved their almost indescribable spirit that one loses but little while one gains the vividness of dramatic presentation . The costumes and makeups are triumphantly literal re-creations of the Tenniel drawings , but they are hardly so remarkable as the way in which painful for me to hear some of the sallies greeted with a kind of laughter which indicated that these same sallies were unfamiliar ; but this response of persons uncultivated enough to be ignorant of the original was proof that the dramatization was almost miraculously successful . Certain of the scenes , especially those involving the two chess queens and the interpretation of The Walrus and the Carpenter by means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else is so significant as the fact that the general spirit was admirably preserved . The play , like the book , fascinates and tantalizes one by the reality of its unreality , by the sense of its nonsense . Not even Strindberg 's " Dream Play " actually catches so successfully the feel of a dream  --  the inescapable logic of things known to be unreal and the insistent but never quite graspable relevance of fable or allegory . " Walk a Little Faster " ( St. James Theater ) has nothing discoverable to do with Alice beyond the fact that it lifts its title from one of the many poems to which she was so unwilling a listener . It is , as a matter of fact , a rather unusually disjointed musical review . However , the presence of Clark and McCullough and of Beatrice Lillie was enough to make it extremely entertaining . Miss Lillie , by the way , is not only on the stage a great deal of the time but is very nearly at her best . Revivals of recent plays have a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Show Off " ( Hudson Theater ) stands up remarkably well . It is still funny and , like all Mr. Kelly 's plays , has an undertone of acrid comment upon American life . It should find a place on any list of standard American plays .
