Last week Joe College was busy gulping goldfish . He garnished it with salt , with mayonnaise or with ketchup , and he chased it with milk , orange juice or soda pop , but one routine did not vary . Each goldfish was gulped alive . <P> " The craving of these goldfish cultists , " explained Chicago 's Consulting Psychologist Robert N. McMurray , " really is for public acclaim , that is , exhibitionism . The eater of goldfish takes delight in the repulsiveness of his act . " <P> Harvard Freshman Lothrop Withington Jr. , son of a onetime ( 1910 ) Harvard football captain , started the fad sweeping U. S. campuses , as raccoon coats did some 10 years ago , as the Veterans of Future Wars did in 1936 . In Withington 's room in Holworthy Hall one night last month conversation turned on his aquarium . Freshman Withington boasted that he had once eaten a goldfish . A classmate remarked it would be worth $10 to see the feat repeated . Thereupon young Withington seized one of his pets by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , won his reward . <P> Three weeks later Franklin and Marshall 's Frank Pope Jr . belittled this feat by salting , peppering and swallowing three goldfish . Unlike Mr. Withington , Mr. Pope did not chew . <P> To regain the championship for his alma mater , Harvard 's Irving Clark Jr . four days later polished off 24 , sucking at an orange after each one . He also offered to eat a bug for a nickel , an angleworm for a dime and a beetle for a quarter . <P> Few hours later University of Pennsylvania 's Gilbert Hollandersky gulped 25 goldfish , topped them with a steak dinner . Then University of Michigan 's Julius Aisner swallowed 28 , Boston College 's Donald V. Mulcahy 29 ( with three bottles of milk ) . Thereupon Albright College 's Football Captain Mike Bonner gulped 33 without a chaser . Outside Boston 's Opera House , Northeastern University 's Jack Smookler raised him three-gulped 36 . <P> By that time humanitarians were thoroughly aroused . In Boston , State Senator George Krapf filed a bill ordering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wanton consumption . " Meanwhile Robert F. Sellar , president of Boston 's Animal Rescue League , threatened to send agents to arrest goldfish swallowers if college authorities did not stop it . Said he : " This is not a subject for levity . I hesitate to bring such a matter to court , but we wo n't sidestep the issue . There have been too many complaints . " <P> Three policemen and 100 cheering students watched the next champion , M. I. T. 's six-foot-four Albert E. Hayes Jr. , wash down 42 fish with four bottles of chocolate soda . He stopped , explained Freshman Hayes , because ' 42 were his class numerals . Said he : " You lay the goldfish well back on the tongue , let it wiggle forward till it hits the top of the throat , then give one big gulp . Same effect as swallowing a raw oyster .
