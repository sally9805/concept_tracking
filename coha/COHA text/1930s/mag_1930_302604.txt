Smiles , produced by Florenz Ziegfeld , is very pretty , very big , very quiet . It contains four of the most charming personages on the U. S. musicomedy stage : Fred &; Adele Astaire , Marilyn Miller , Eddie Foy Jr . Producer Ziegfeld is one of the few entrepreneurs who can distribute elaborate scenery , lovely costumes and beautiful women about a big stage and at the same time keep the decoration from becoming Levantine . But Vincent Youmans has written far more distinguished music ( in Show Girl , Rainbow , Great Day ) than he has provided for Smiles and the book never gives Tom Powers ( onetime partner of Joe Cook ) a chance to be half as amusing as he can be . <P> The thin little story of Smiles has to do with a War orphan who is discovered and cared for by three comics and a tenor . When she grows up the orphan turns out to be Miss Miller who is universally loved and cherished . She avoids marrying a rich young man ( Fred Astaire ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the program is supplied by the Astaires when they cavort in front of a smalltown band . And at one point Eddie Foy Jr. , tipsy in Paris , can be heard singing a few bars of a song with lyrics by Ring Lardner : <P> You 've done everything you can <P> To make it pleasant in Japan , <P> But , why ai n't I home ? <P> <P> Art &; Mrs. Bottle . Jane Cowl has introduced this comedy by Benn W. Levy ( adapter of Topaze ) to alternate with her performances of Twelfth Night . The play is well above the average as to script , is ably acted . Miss Cowl assumes the role of a lady who , having run away with an artist who later abandoned her , returns to her husband , son and daughter after 20 years . She finds her son in love with a model , her daughter in love with her seductive artist , her husband in a quandary . The final unraveling of all this is perhaps overlong , but splendid are the queenly gesturings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble rascality of Leon Quartermaine as the painter . <P> <P> Marseilles is a work of Marcel Pagnol ( Topaze ) , originally titled Marius . One reason for the acclaim which the play received in Paris was the Provenal dialect of most of its actors . This effect , of course , is completely lacking in the U. S. production , somewhat limiting the power of the original play which was largely a collection of swift , thoroughgoing character sketches . The action takes place in a waterfront saloon , the son ( Alexander Kirkland ) of whose ponderous proprietor ( Dudley Digges ) is sea-struck . He must choose between going to the South Seas and remaining with his sweetheart ( Frances Torchiana ) , both families being longtime friends . Throughout this tale of youthful self-sacrifice are interpolated visitors to the estaminet : a pompous ferryboat commander who is touchy on the subject of his wife 's fidelity ; the roguish , lovable saloonkeeper ; able Guy Kibbee ( late mortuary supply salesman of Torch Song ) who is in love with Miss Torchiana .
