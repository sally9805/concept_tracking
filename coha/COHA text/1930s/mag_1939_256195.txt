Last January John Davison Rockefeller Jr . reached the age of 65 and last fortnight he announced that , according to regulations , he had retired from the Rockefeller General Education Board , and would soon quit the Rockefeller Foundation . Last week , to the surprise of scientists all over the U. S. , the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research enforced retirement rules on its working scientists for the first time , suddenly announced the withdrawal of five of its most brilliant members . Although the five scientists will hand over their administrative duties to younger colleagues , they will all receive pensions , and most of them will continue their important research work in Foundation laboratories . The retirees , five of the keenest scientific brains on earth : <P> Dr. Florence Rena Sabin , 67 . In 1893 , plain , blonde Florence Sabin graduated from Smith College . After a short period of teaching zoology , she bravely entered Johns Hopkins Medical School , thus starting a long career of firsts : first woman to graduate from the Hopkins , first woman to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first ( and only ) woman member of the National Academy of Sciences . She is famed for her discovery of the origin and processes of the lymphatic system , her account of the development of blood cells , her studies of the blood in tuberculosis , her testing of chemical substances isolated from the tubercle bacillus . In 1929 Dr. Simon Flexner , former head of the Institute , called her " the greatest living woman scientist and one of the foremost scientists of all time . " <P> Dr. Karl Landsteiner , 70 . Nervous , Austrian-born Dr. Landsteiner won the 1930 Nobel Prize in Medicine , for discovering that there are four main types of human blood with at least 30 subtypes . As a result of his discovery , blood transfusion ha become a safe operation .
