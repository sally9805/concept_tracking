txt The Afro-European Crisis LONDON  --  Prime Minister Baldwin told Conservative women Britain wanted to reform the League of Nations so that it should embrace all the world , including the United States , Germany and Japan . He championed the sanctions principle . ROME  --  The Chamber of Deputies , unanimously and with enthusiasm , ratified the annexation of Ethiopia and the proclamation of the King as Emperor . An ovation was given to army leaders . GENEVA  --  As the Council of the League of Nations concluded its session there was an understanding that the Mediterranean coalition against Italy would continue while sanctions were still enforced . Baldwin , Reveals League Ideas By VEILDENTAND HUHN Jr . Wireless to Trre New Yes= Tines . LONDON , May ** Minister Stanley Baldwin announced today that his government would try to re-form the League of Nations so drastically that the United States , Germany and Japan could be persuaded to join it . Without those three powers , said Mr. Baldwin , the League was crippled , and sanctions against Italy were less effective than they should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Conservative party , associations , the aim of the British policy would be to make the League truly more world-wide , as its founders intended . For " Feasible " Changes " Probably at the Autumn meeting of the League , " said Mr. Baldwin , " the members will have to consider among many things what , if any , changes are necessary in the covenant . If any changes may be found helpful for inducing those nations outside the League to come into it ; if any such changes can be seen to be feasible , then , indeed , I hope they will be considered with all sincerity and with every desire to make the League at last what it was hoped to be at the beginning-. a universal league . " Mr. Baldwin hinted that he himself always disliked Article xvr , which provides for measures against an aggressor , and that he also wanted Article XI changed so that a threat of war could be acted upon more promptly in the future than in the case of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute . He left the impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned with widening the membership of the League than with strengthening its powers . While the Prime Minister was talking a little wistfully of American membership in the League , Lord Dickinson , church leader , better known as Sir Willoughby Dickinson , was appealing to the United ? States in the House of Lords to undo the work of the Senate in 1919 and join the rest of the world at Geneva . Lord Dickinson expressed the hope that , if President Roosevelt were re-elected , the United States might " accept its share of responsibility in the international life of the world , " and Added that if the price of American cooperation were removal of Article XVI , he would gladly pay it . In the House of Lords debate  --  as in Mr. Baldwin 's speech  --  reform of the League was felt to be the only logical result of the League 's present failure . No Attack Upon Critics A fortnight ago , in receiving a deputation of pro-League leaders , Mr. Baldwin said he felt " bitter humiliation " at the events in Ethiopia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he refused to accept one iota of blame for what had occurred , and said Britain had more than played her part in attempting to check the aggressor . But the long-awaited attack on his critics did not come , nor did Mr. Baldwin even hint whether sanctions would be maintained or abandoned . He talked as if he were thinking aloud , simply giving a few clues as to the direction in which his mind was moving . Just because Article XVI has failed to restrain Italy , said Mr. Baldwin , it does not follow that the covenant must be scrapped . " If you find an instrument will not do what you want , " he declared , " it does not mean your desire is impossible of achievement . " What it does mean , he went on , is that the instrument must be altered so as to make it effective in the future . This , he indicated , was the purpose of the League reform that would be attempted at Geneva in the Fall , for if all the nations are inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its founders . Mr. Baldwin quickly passed to the theme of rearmament , which is coming more and more to dominate his speeches and those of his colleagues in the - government . " Speaking here to a British audience , can I be blamed if I put as our first object the safety of our own land and empire ? " he exclaimed amid cheers . The peace of Europe and the peace of the world came next , he said , but there could be no peace unless Britain was strongly armed . He refused to rule out military sanctions from the covenant , saying they were " an essential part of collective security . " But automatic military sanctions were difficult to put into force since each member of the League was a sovereign State in itself , answerable only to its own public opinion . Hence , said Mr. Baldwin , there would have to be earlier consultation in the event of another threat of war . The same idea has been expressed recently by Viscount Cecil of Chelwood and other devoted adherents of the League who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to Geneva , said the Prime Minister , it might be easier to develop the League 's conciliatory functions and make the use of its repressive powers unnecessary , Hints at French Failure He took a dig at France by warning that there was no limited partnership in collective security . " You can not be a sleeping partner , " he exclaimed . " Neither does collective security mean that all the work is to be done by the British Navy . " Mr. Baldwin also chided pacifists of this country who urged closing of the Suez Canal and going to war with Italy . No democratic country can go to war without the consent of its people , nor are the democratic nations of Europe ready to march for any reason except a threat to their own security , he said . Many little nations could not defend , themselves against a powerful aggressor , he warned , and if war did come it might mean two or three countries would have to do all the fighting . Finally , Mr. Baldwin said , there was no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We shall try again , " he said , " to see where our scheme has gone wrong and whether we can accomplish it . " Mr. Baldwin 's speech failed to thrill his supporters and left a large section of his own party profoundly dissatisfied . It was felt the Prime Minister and his colleagues were still groping for a new foreign policy and did not yet know how to meet the problem caused by Italy 's conquest of Ethiopia . A crowded meeting of the government foreign affairs committee of the House of Common  --  attended by more than a hundred members of the government parties  --  tonight called upon Mr. Baldwin to make up his mind and give a clear lead to public opinion . Sir Austen Chamberlain and Winston Churchill , leaders of the growing revolt against Mr. Baldwin within the Conservative ranks , attended the meeting . According to an official announcement issued afterward , the meeting decided that " the realities of the present situation are not sufficiently understood by the public and that it is of the utmost importance that opinion should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no desire to rush Mr. Baldwin into abandonment of sanctions , but the consensus was he I should decide on his policy soon and then lead the country boldly as a true leader should .
