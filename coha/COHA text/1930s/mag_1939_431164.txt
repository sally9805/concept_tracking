IT WAS a fine , shining summer morning , a day on which to congratulate yourself and the neighbors . Sarah Smith had gone down the street to do her marketing and shopping , to make her money go as far as she could . There was less to spend in the Smith family than there had been two years before , and even then there had been none too much for comfort and security . Taxes were higher . The bank was paying less interest on savings accounts . The insurance dividend had been cut , which made the net premium as large as last year , and they had n't counted on that . In one way or another the Smiths often felt pinched . Not that Sarah Smith was discouraged . She knew that she was lucky to have a home , to have kept up the payments on it so far , and to have no overdue bills . Every time Mrs. Smith read the foreign news in the papers she was thankful that she lived here . There was a great blaring and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was happening . So did other people . A parade was coming along . An odd parade . There were no marchers , no decorated floats . It was a parade made up entirely of small cars , and they were full of men who were not dressed up to represent anything except what they werehusky-looking working-men . They were cheerful . They leaned out the windows of the cars and kept their horns and sirens going . " Who are they ? What 's the parade for ? " Sarah Smith asked an intelligent-looking man beside her . " That 's a parade of WPA strikers . " " What are they striking for ? " " Shorter hours , or they say they wo n't work . " " But I thought they wanted work . To get off direct relief to work relief . " The other spectator said : " It 's not so simple as that . It 's become a cornplicated business . If they work thirtytwo hours a week , which is the new regulation , they ca n't hold down more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for subsistence and pick up other jobs on the side . It works out , too , that they 'll get less money for the same amount of work , and they 're sore about that . And some of the unions are back of them because they 're afraid that if wages go down on public works , private industry will cut wages , too . " " But , " said Sarah Smith loudly . over the blare of the horns , " I still do n't see . How can people strike who are getting government money that was voted for relief ? Because the government does n't really need most of the work these men do . If they do n't want to do it , they 're the ones who are out of luck . It seems to me they could be replaced by men who do want work , easily enough . " " That may make trouble , " the  | - ranger answered . " They have an organization . " " I never saw a parade before with e veryone in cars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , lady , " he said , " there 's nothing to be done about . It 's just the way things are getting to be . " The men were well behaved in spite of the noise . No one was making ' trouble . If this mood held , there 'd be riots . But it did n't make sense ? protest parade by automobile , workers whose jobs had been created r them did n't want to work thirtyo hours a week . Suddenly Sarah thought of her father working from dawn to dark on the farm , of her husband going back to work night after night when they were first married , of her own days , which so often did n't have enough hours in them for the work she had to do and wanted to do . She thought of how hard it was to pay the taxes , which paid these men . There was something fantastic about this . And the man beside her just laughed helplessly and hopelessly and looked on . She turned to him . She said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in the cars . It 's the fault of people like you who say there 's nothing to be done . It 's your fault and my fault . " .. . If I were one of those experts who track down the critical and exasperated groups in the United States of the moment , I would not ignore the Sarah Smiths . These are the ordinary American housekeepers , and , with their sister wage-earners , who also spend their lives making ends meet , they are going to have something to say when the time comes . They are still diffident about their opinions , because they have so often been told , either indulgently or superciliously , that the intricacies of government and of finance are over their heads . Sarah Smith is a good citizen in theory and in practice . She has principles , which she carries out even when they thwart her hopes or disappoint her desires . She likes to live in a pleasant house ; but she realizes that the mortgage on it must not be too large . She likes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must constantly consider the grocery bill . She must live on what she and her husband have to spend ? or else they will be overcome by debt and ultimately be bankrupt . Being no fool , and having seen what bankruptcy does to people , Sarah Smith does n't want any of it in her family . She realizes that the world today is not her personal oyster ? that it is nobody 's oyster ? and that she must share with thousands and millions of others the shocks of wars and depressions . She knows that between her and people on relief is no unbridgeable gulf . But , being a realist , she thinks that the first thing she can do to help solve the relief problem is to keep off the rolls herself . She wants to put something aside for the rainy day that is almost bound to come for her family . Some new industrial adjustment might jolt her husband out of a job . He might become ill and unable to work . She herself may need an operation . One of the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah Smith knows that great consideration and warm sympathy and material assistance should be given to those who have tried hard and yet have failed . But to help others you have to be in a position to help them . She is not an isolationist in spirit . She is aware that her home is greatly affected by the neighborhood in which it stands , and her country by the world in which it must exist . This is true both as to property values and as to the possibilities of pleasant and sociable living . To that end , she does all she can to keep her neighborhood desirable . Her ambition for her home is that it be comfortable and well kept upand paid for . She wants to keep the members of her family healthy and happy and to help each of them to progress mentally and physically . These hopes and principles are not of her own devising . Good people all over the world want the same things .  | Politicians have been telling Sarah Smith for years ? and so have preachers and poets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the United States is founded on the principles of the American home and exists to protect and to maintain it . What Sarah Smith can not see is why , if that is true , politicians and those concerned with government should disregard the principles of economy , solvency , and thrift that are basic in a good household . Why should debt on the grand scale be safe and excusable and debt on the small scale so dangerous ? Why do families have to live on their incomes if governments do not ? Why should 11 million people be out of work , while money lies in banks , money that could start industries ? When Sarah Smith simplifies the state of affairs in her own mind , she sees that solution must be possible . The United States not only can feed itself ; but there is so much on our pantry shelves that some think they are overstocked , and that good food is thrown away ? a horror to the housekeeper . In the same way the national toolshed is splendidly equipped . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well handled and apprentices trained . Looked at from the housekeeping and upkeep angles , many things need doing in the United States . There are shacks that should be torn down , children who need extra food , boys who should be put to work . New houses should be built . Why not get these things done ? External enemies do not stop us. nternal enemies are few and feeble . Something must be wrong with the management when , as Sarah Smith sees there is everything to " do with " and et things do n't get done . IF SHE says this , she is listened to tolerantly . The Great American Myth is expounded gravely to her . She is told that the problems of a government ? in a democracy ? are beyond common understanding . The thing is Too Big . It is Too complicated . She is told that she can ' understand relief problems , or the mechinism of government , or facts about Gold Ind Exchange . In exasperation and patriotism , Sarah Smith is beginning to doubt the Myth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 11 have to understand it if I 'm going : o keep a roof over my head and bring up the children decently and give them some chance in the future . If our Congressman can understand it , so can I. He 's k good man but no genius . And maybe I ) ught to tell him what I think about things Ind what people like me want . " If a democracy is in such a tangle that is affairs are incomprehensible to the noting citizen , then by that fact alone it eases to be a democracy . Of course , there just be students and experts in every government . It takes an electrical engineer and a good many assistants to set up a : ghting plant . But the ordinary person mows how to turn on lights and how many he can afford . One of the supposed Incomprehensibles s Money . There follow others , such as he Public Debt , Government Spending , Taxes , and Government Organization . These subjects interlock , and their order makes no great difference ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself examining the others . So perhaps she Begins with Gold . She has been cowed into regarding Gold is a mystery . But it is n't a mystery . It is right , nonferrous metal , and its very Nape , in bars , is simple . The United States has 30,000 tons of gold , which amounts 109 to $7,000,000,000 . Buying coal has acquainted her with tons . She knows dollars . The United States has two thirds of the world 's gold supply ? far more than our share . Why ? Because we received part of it from those abroad who want a safe depository . It is , in part , gold received in exchange for goods we have sold to other countries . This makes us very rich and very important , thinks Sarah Smith at first . Then she begins to wonder : " Gold is only gold . I have it in my wedding ring . In my teeth . As long as it is valuable , we are rich . Will it always be valuable ? " It will be valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is conceivable that in time , or as a result of war , many countries might decide to do without gold and to have self-sufficient economic systems with managed currencies and managed industries . They might even be able to conduct what little commerce they have on a barter basis . Then would we still be rich ? Perhaps we 'd just have a lot of gold on our hands . This is a far cry ; but Sarah Smith is unwilling to trust that great gold supply too much ? or even boast about it until we see what good it is to us . And that depends partly on what happens abroad . In any case , tangible though the gold may be , it is n't for spending or for distribution . It is stored in great vaults in the earth and closely guarded . The title to it is held by the Federal Reserve Banks The Treasury holds the gold on deposit for the banks and issues against it gold certificates , which the banks use as reserves against deposits . The gold is useful only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet legal reserve requirements against deposits and currency in circulation . BUT in spite of having that gold , we have the National Debt ? which is growing like a snowball rolling down a snow-covered hill . The Debt is " too big to be understood " and " too big to be criticized . " Sarah Smith questions that , especiall as she looks at the facts . She finds that the national debt in 1931 was $16,801. - 000,000 , and that today it is somewhere between 40 and 45 billion dollars . Perhaps she can not quite realize the amount of billion dollars ; but Sarah Smith can see how many times 16 goes into 40 and understand that the debt has become nearly 2 ? times greater in 8 years . These , she realizes , too , were not years of war . How did it get that way ? Well , the money 's just been spent . That 's how one gets into debt . The government spend : more than it used to . In 1927 Congress appropriated $2,974,000,000 ? a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress appropriated $9,250,000,000 . Of course , times have changed . A lot o people have been up against it , clamoring for government help . Something had to be done . Sarah Smith knows that . The country has had to take care of its people just as John Smith had to use up his savings and borrow money the year the bab was born and his mother died and hi , brother was out of a job . But you ca n't go on like that . Not indefinitely . John one ( had to tell his brother that , firmly . The thing that makes Sarah Smith grim is this She may not comprehend a billion dollars but she certainly can understand this sen tence : For every $1 of revenue in the las 9 years the government spent $1.66 . And she thinks again : " You ca n't do it You ca n't go on like that indefinitely . I does n't make sense . " What did they do with all that money ' Where did it go ? The facts have been printed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting to all the Sarah  | Smiths . For government subsidies and war costs , the budget of the United States for 1939-1940 is $7,391,000,000 . For all other departments , including the new social-security government expenses , the budget is $1,952,000,000 . A great many people feel that women tire of figures . They do not know how many women pore over them . They may be adding up the grocery bill or making a household budget . They may be figuring how to adjust a household to a cut in income , or , more happily , to a raise . But figures interest women . These figures ( taken from The United States News , May 15 , 1939 ) from the 1939-1940 budget interest Sarah Smith : National Defense $1,386,000,000 Relfef and Public Works. $2,916,000.000 Veterans ' Payments and Interest on Public Debt $1,596,000,000 Agriculture $1,493,000,000 These make up that staggering total of more than 7 billion dollars for government subsidies and war costs . Which brings us back to that dreary refrain of spending $1.66 for every $1 of income . What is the answer ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut down expenses or make more money . But the housewife knows that while she may hope and trust that her husband will get a raise and make more money , the worst thing she can do is to spend his raise before he gets it . The same thing is true of the country . Instead of going ahead as if there were $1.66 to spend , the country and its administrators must realize that it has only $1 , and try to live on it . Otherwise , sometime that debt will catch up with the country and overwhelm it . The United States wo n't be able to pay its debt , and , as its debt is owed , in large part , to the citizens and corporations who hold its bonds , its failure to pay will mean bankruptcy all around . That will be the end of this country , as Sarah Smith has known and loved it . There is nothing to do but cut down expenses . Other countries do it . And here , for the first time , Sarah Smith comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomprehensible problem . As she looks at the diagram of government , with its many departments , she is not appalled by its intricacy . For all its size , it 's a question of chairmen and committees and sub committees , pretty much as it is in any organization . The thing that baffles her at first is where it is best to cut . Of course , it is easy enough to cut off small wastes and crazy extravagances . But that cut is n't nearly large  | enough . It is evidently going to be a matter of going without things that are not only good to have but useful and improving . Perhaps , she thinks , one day we 'll get them , if we go without them now . But something drastic must be done . And the immediate thing is to start the machinery by dealing with the persons who can effect something , who have direct influence . She writes to her Congressman . who was elected by her vote and who will want her vote again . She writes her opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before long , either in letters or on ballots . They should write . No one is more anxious to feel the pulse of the public than the Congressman . He is often puzzled about what people think is best for the country . He reads his mail . sorts his letters , counts them , analyzes them . So that is the way people feel , he thinks , and is glad to know and to act on their wishes . The woman who writes to her Congressman out of knowledge and out of patriotism is not imposing on him . nor is she wasting her own time . So Sarah Smith thought , as she wrote : " DEAR SIR : " Once when you were campaigning in this part of the district , you shook hands with me , among others , and you asked me to let you know if ever there was anything you could do for me in Washington . There is a good deal you can do . I can not have a good or solvent home unless it is established in a solvent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government finances , the more obvious that becomes . The more you spend , the shakier my personal budget will be , and I am worried . " I realize many of your problems . Some of them , though they are on a large scale . resemble mine . You are trying to run a country , and I am trying to run a household . It costs too much to run this country today , and we are getting deeper and deeper into debt with , as I see it , precious little chance of ever getting out , if we go on at this rate . We probably should n't have spent so much . But since we did . we 'll now have to reduce our debt and get along on less until we catch up . " The debts that we have incurred must be interpreted in terms of human subsistence , of worthy projects visioned and begun , of costly failures and errors of judgment . The debt has been rolled up ay hundreds and thousands of spenders and as many desires and needs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not easy . " But the principle of debt is not complicated . Debt is honest only when it can De paid and when the borrower is confident that he can and will pay it . The result of reckless and excessive debt has lever varied through the centuries , though he symbols of money and systems of ) after often change . Debt must be paid ) r repudiated , and to repudiate a debt of he size you have incurred for me and ender the conditions of guaranty would mean that we would have to repudiate the government that made it . No one would rust that government again . " I am perfectly willing to put somehing aside to help with the country 's expenses , which are my responsibility as veil as yours . But if I pay taxes as large Ls those I am paying ? the direct taxes and the unseen taxes , too ? I wish we could ) egin to get back on our feet . Otherwise , t seems to me as if I were pouring money town a rathole , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of experience in manging , I would like to suggest the ways to ut expenses that seem wisest . First of all . . re must not allow the physical health of he nation to suffer . Health comes first , and have always found that by preventing Unless I saved , in the long run , a good deal on doctor 's bills and nursing and breakdowns.  | I 'd like to remind you that there is plenty to eat in this country if you can set it forth before the people , and I have been especially encouraged by the fact that a great deal of good food seems to be being made available to the general public by means of cooperation between the growers and the distributors and the government agencies . Keep it up . " You always have to cut down on service when you are cutting expenses . I have friends who have maids they ca n't afford . They say they do n't want to put the girls out of a job . It is n't helping the girls much to have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all secure . We may all have to do a big day 's work in one way or another , but that 's what energy and muscles are for . I do n't want to see anyone overworked . But I do n't want to employ anyone who ca n't be counted on for a good day 's work . You should n't either . Especially not when you are paying their wages with my taxes . " I think that interest on the public debt is one thing that keeps us poor . We 'll never get out of the woods if that interest increases . Naturally , you must take care of men who were wounded or incapacitated in the war : but there does n't seem to be much reason for providing for people who were just doing their duty and did n't get hurt . They 'd respect you more if you told them the truth ? that you ca n't afford it . But they wo n't believe that you ca n't afford it if you are spending money in all sorts of directions and helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without subsidies and are being helped so much today that they are losing independence . " YOU 'D be surprised , Mr. Congressman , I how much people can do for themselves if they have to . Old people and orphans have to be helped ; but it does n't take much to care for them unless we employ too many people to do it . Strong adults should help to carry their own load . " Several times my husband has had reverses , and we 've had to face the fact that we did n't have money to do things that we wanted to do . We got along without them all right . My only regret is that I could n't give the children so fine an education as I had hoped to . But they 've been able to learn a good deal , nonetheless , and they are much better educated today than either of their parents . " I am sure that you feel about the country as I do about my own home . This is a beautiful country in a good location , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title to it . But look out for that mortgage , the Debt . I know . because I 've had a mortgage on my house , and once or twice it nearly got ahead of me . " And one thing more that grows more important daily . I hope you will keep us out of war . I do not mean that I think we can or should fail to do our share to maintain civilization . But this is a country of great influence . It can help to maintain civilization without demanding the lives of its citizens . In spite of our sympathy for our neighbors abroad , we believe that wars have caused their problems , not cured them . If you 'll look at it sensibly and remember that the big thing is to get out of debt and not spend more than you have it will come out all right . We have a lot to go on in this country , and a lot to dc with , and plenty of competent people whc understand just what you and all of us art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you work with us and fot us . But we ca n't go on like this .  |
