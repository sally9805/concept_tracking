In 1928 James Eugene Bassett of Annapolis , Md. , just out of the U. S. Naval Academy , was transferred to the Pacific Fleet at Manila . He drove across the U. S. to Seattle . There he put an advertisement in the newspapers to sell his car . An unsmiling 63-year-old woman named Mary Eleanor Smith and her crippled son , Earl , answered the advertisement . James Bassett drove out to their house . Mrs. Smith engaged him in conversation while Earl hobbled up behind and hit him over the head with a hammer . Then they cut him into pieces , burned part , buried part , and scattered his teeth up and down the road . <P> Thus , last week in the Washington State Penitentiary at Walla Walla , Mary Eleanor Smith told the story . The murder of James Bassett was the most celebrated West Coast crime of the 1920 's . Mrs. Smith and her son Earl were picked up in Oakland , Calif , in Bassett 's car . The fragmentary corpse was never found though much excavation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Smith was the first in the U. S. in which the prosecution used the lie-detector and " truth serum . " Mrs. Smith and Earl , who were rather simple people , were so terrified by science that they confessed enthusiastically to everything . But the public indignantly protested the newfangled lie-detector . The defense got an injunction , mother and son were finally sentenced only for stealing Bassett 's car , which , when not under the lie-detector 's influence , they claimed they had legitimately bought . Mrs. Smith got eight years ; Earl , as an habitual criminal , got life . <P> The efforts of the State to get a confession by less scientific methods were unending . Earl at one point was put in solitary confinement for a year . A year ago State Patrol Sergeant Joseph McCauley disguised himself as a clergyman and went to see Mary . After a few visits he got her to thinking along religious lines and finally last week , five days before her sentence was up , she decided " to make herself right with her Maker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed James Bassett . When he was younger , in Montana , he had killed three other people . He had been disguised as a clergyman at the time , which must have given State Patrol Sergeant Joseph McCauley quite a start . When she was taken to Earl and taxed him with his crimes . Earl said , " Ma , do you feel all right ? " But two days later he confessed , too . The State Parole Board let Mrs. Smith out five days early , and she went to Seattle with State Police carrying shovels , to see if she could help them dig up a piece or two of James Bassett 's body .
