Two months ago a petty issue-appointment of a doctor named Adrian Martens to the Flemish Academy of Medicine-cut through Belgian politics like a hot knife through lard . Patriotic War Veterans objected to Dr. Martens ' appointment on the grounds that he was 1 ) a mediocre medical man , 2 ) one who had worked during the War to split the Flemish districts from the rest of Belgium and set them up as an autonomous State . Soon the Flemish-Walloon issue had all Belgium so divided that King Leopold dissolved Parliament and ordered a new election . <P> By the time the election was held last week , external pressure had molded the lump of lard back into one solid piece . Belgians were so frightened by what happened to an internally weak Czecho-Slovakia that they crowded to the polls to elect a Parliament of unity , moderation , stability . Most extremist parties lost seats while the moderate Liberals and Catholics gained . Socialists lost more than a quarter of their strength , and the fascist Rexists were almost completely wiped out . Even Eupen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany , voted 55% nationalist and anti-German . <P> Most striking incident in Belgium 's sudden unification : Dr. Martens resigned from the Academy . He announced his resignation at one o'clock the afternoon of election day-just when the polls closed , so as not to influence the vote but in plenty of time to remove his irksome issue from Belgian politics before the new Parliament meets .
