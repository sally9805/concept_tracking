TESTAMENT-R . C. Hutchinson-Farrar &; Rinehart ( $3 ) . <P> When Ray Coryton Hutchinson 's fourth novel , Shining Scabbard , was published last year , one excited English reviewer called him " one of the very few living English novelists who will be read fifty- perhaps a hundred-years hence . " Other reviewers did not hurl their hats quite so high , but they agreed on Hutchinson 's amazing virtuosity . <P> Onetime ad writer for a mustard concern and sober-living father of three , Author Hutchinson* wrote The Answering Glory , an intense story of a woman missionary in Africa , from the snug purview of his London suburb . Although he was only eleven when the Armistice was signed , The Unforgotten Prisoner was an apparently first-hand account of English and German War victims . And he wrote Shining Scabbard , a grim novel of French family life , with no closer acquaintance with France than French literature . <P> His most ambitious tour de force so far , Testament is Author Hutchinson 's try at assimilating Russia : a Russian novel , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the War and the first years of the Revolution . In its length ( 693 pages ) , its crowded , turbulent background , its hero-intellectual ( a Christ-like count who opposes both Tsarism and the Revolution ) , Testament is clearly patterned after the novels of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky . <P> To hurried readers Author Hutchinson will appear to have met these great Russians on their own ground . He gives a remarkably sympathetic characterization of Russian intellectuals and professionals ; he writes exciting , if confused , narrative ; even achieves some of the massive tediouness of the Russian novelists . But where the Russians succeeded best-in portraying the Russian peasantry who shaped the character of the Revolution-Author Hutchinson fails : the brilliant Russian surface of Testament cracks open to reveal dim , confused sketches of the real thing , a novel that at the core is English after all . <P> *Not to be confused with A. S. M. Hutchinson , who wrote If Winter Comes ( see p. 86 ) .                @ @ @ @ @
