Last week a Manhattan cancer specialist announced a positive method of detecting a teratoma of the testicle , which is a monstrous kind of pregnancy in men . The test is precisely the test for pregnancy in women . <P> Men , of course , can not bear babies despite the romantic notions called couvade , whereby the father writhes in bed when the mother goes through labor . But men may harbor the elements of muscle , skin , hair , cartilage and organs which go to make up a baby . The monstrosity 's favorite nest is a testicle . In itself the teratoma is not dangerous . But its parts , being embryonic in nature , may at any provocation burst into a rage of growth . Then a man has a wild cancer sending its buds throughout his system and early recognition of the monstrosity , its prompt abortion by x-ray and castration , become important . <P> Dr. Russell Sweetser Ferguson of Manhattan 's Memorial Hospital got the clue for his teratoma detector from Dr. Bernhard Zondek , German Jew now without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dr. Selmar Aschheim , his colleague , found that the pituitary gland of women enlarges during pregnancy and produces two sex hormones , Prolan A and Prolan B. As soon as a woman begins to gestate a baby she begins to create those hormones , and they promptly appear in her urine . <P> A sexually immature female mouse injected with a concentrate of the urine of pregnancy will in four days begin to produce eggs precisely as if she were full grown . The seminal vesicles of an immature male mouse similarly treated will grow large . This Aschheim-Zondek test for pregnancy is delicate and practically infallible . <P> If pregnant women produce Prolan A and Prolan B , perhaps men with teratomata might produce the same sex hormones . In Manhattan Dr. Ferguson was excited by this surmise as was Dr. Zondek in Germany . Dr. Ferguson pounced on the premise . Memorial Hospital gave him plenty of teratoma cases and enabled Dr. Ferguson to announce last week ( in the American Journal of Cancer ) that the hormone test for teratomata is 98% positive . It detects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swelling . The younger the teratoma , that is , the more primitive the fetal elements , the stronger is the hormone reaction . " Adult " tumors give weak reactions because their contents are bits of fully formed body parts .
