txt Despite the fact that since June 13 detectives have fairly swarmed through the two adjoining buildings at 580 Fifth Avenue and 1 West Forty-seventh Street , which house some of the leading diamond cutting firms , two gunmen at 5:30 P. M. yesterday made a daring raid on a tenth floor cutter 's office in the latter building . The crash of glass , as one of the brothers who own the firm thrust his hand through a window living on to an inner court , frightened the thieves away empty-handed . But , considering the difficulties they had to face both going in and coming out , the attempt was an exceedingly bold one . Fifth Avenue was crowded with home-going office workers and shoppers as the radio cars rushed to the scene , and for a few moments excitement ran high . But as far as was learned , the police found no one who reported having seen two men answering the robbers ' description leave either by the Fifth Avenue or side street entrances of the buildings , which are connected by interior corridors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not estimate the value of the uncut and cut stones that were saved , but he said that firms such as the Doppelt Brothers , the one raided , probably had at least $100,000 worth of gems in *heir offices . It was reported that the tip that the robbery was planned was received at the Baer-Braddock fight on June 13 . Detectives refused , however , to say whether this was true . But about that time they began to frequent the building with unusual interest it was revealed , About June 15 men from headquarters personally supervised the changing of every lock in the two buildings  --  the Empire Trust Building on Fifth Avenue is thirtythree stories high , and the Bren- tano Building at 1 West Forty-seventh Street , twelve stories . The Doppelts occupy a suite in the latter , with an entrance at Room 1005 . Miss Dora Springer , 19 years old , the bookkeeper , was just putting on her hat to go home when the thieves , pistols in hand , entered . They had passed through a glass outer door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipped with bullet-proof glass , with a key obtained in a manner that remained a mystery , and then got through still a third door . This , also locked , was negotiated by one of the two bandits by thrusting his hand through a footsquare trap used for viewing persons outside . He seized the handle and turned it . Miss Springer and Uscher Doppelt , the only persons in the office , were covered by pistols . Mr. Doppelt ran to an inner office and locked himself in , according to the superintendent 's statement . There , he pressed the button of an electric alarm system , notifying police headquarters , and then thrust his right hand through the window , cutting the wrist and thumb . The noise apparently so frightened the men that they ran , dropping a pair of steel handcuffs and a knife . Later , on the seventh floor fire-escape stairs , a fully loaded 38-calibre pistol and a pair of suede gloves were found . Mr. White was on the ground floor when he heard the sirens of the radio cars as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told of the hold-up and at once ordered the front gate shut and the building alarm , which locks all important doors , such as stair and exit doors , and sounds a siren , put in operation , But it was too late . If Mr. Doppelt had been able to reach a building alarm button , Mr. White said , it would have been impossible for the gunmen to escape . The three exits , one on Fifth Avenue and two on Forty-seventh Street , would have been instantly shut , and the siren , which can be heard blocks away , would have been put in full blast . Three hold-up men were trapped in the building in this manner two years ago , the superintendent recalled . Mr. Doppelt , who is 41 years old and lives at 2,512 Grand Avenue , Brooklyn , was treated for his injuries by a Flower Hospital ambulance doctor and sent home . Miss Springer was uninjured . After the exit doors of the two buildings were closed , it was thirtyfive minutes before they were reopened . Meanwhile the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of workers still in the buildings were virtual prisoners during this time , but all were able to identify themselves , though they were delayed in going to their homes .
