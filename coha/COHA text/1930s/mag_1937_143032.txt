Rollicking along a New Jersey road one dawn three years ago , President George D. Strohmeyer of Childs Co. ( restaurants ) and some elated friends spied a sign : Maridell Inn . They tore the sign down , made a bonfire of it . Caught in the act by a policeman , they then split a fine of $75 plus $19.50 costs . This week Childs 's President Strohmeyer again made news with a restaurant sign . This time , instead of tearing down an old one , he hung a new one : The Host , Incorporated . <P> Today there are 90 Childs restaurants in 23 U. S. cities and Toronto , Montreal and Winnipeg , Canada . All stem from a lunchroom started in 1889 on Manhattan 's Cortlandt Street by Brothers Samuel and William Childs with $1,600 capital . Farm boys from Bernardsville . N. J. , the Childs Boys , irked by eating in dirty hash-houses , decided to offer the public something cheap and clean . While public clamor for sanitary improvement was building up to the Pure Food &; Drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Nation 's Host from Coast to Coast , " their symbol a pretty girl making wheat-cakes in the window . <P> Emergence of the soda fountain lunch in the 19203 , a change in the public taste in decoration from sanitation to esthetics and ( after Brother Samuel 's death ) Brother William ' s espousal of vegetarianism put Childs on the skids . In 1929 , after a grim fight for proxy control . Chairman Childs was forced out and General Counsel William A. Barber took his place . He and a new president , William Porter Allen , modernized both Childs restaurants and Childs food . White tiles yielded to Puritan , even to Moorish decorations with dance orchestras and goldfish ponds . Meat returned to the menu and instead of vegetarian dogma Childs sponsored a noisy campaign to " Eat all you can for 60 . " After an unsuccessful trial this also was dropped like a hot pancake .

This tall , red-haired young man with a fondness for dogs and fishing joined Childs in 1927 as an accountant , and was assistant treasurer when the shake-up came . Transferred to real-estate supervision , he cut rent costs $500,000 by abandoning bad property , persuading landlords that it would be less unprofitable to reduce Childs rent than to force the company into bankruptcy . In 1933 George Strohmeyer became president at 35 . In 1936 Childs made a profit of $291,000 . In the first six months of 1937 the company made $199,000.
