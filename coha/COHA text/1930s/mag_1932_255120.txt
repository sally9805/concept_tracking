Face the Music is a timely , satirical musicomedy which ordains itself to laugh and sing away the Depression . Scene I discloses a host of newly pauperized millionaires lunching gaily at the Automat , while a sightly chorus chants : See Mr. Whitney passing by , Putting mustard on a Swiss-on-Rye . . . There 's Mrs. William Randolp Hearst , Saying , " That 's my place I got there first ! " <P> Written by Moss Hart and directed by George S. Kaufman , two genuinely funny men who collaborated on Once In A Lifetime , Face the Music 's showmanlike libretto spares few phases of the contemporary metropolitan scene its breathless lampooning . <P> Times would indeed appear to be bad . You can see Ethel Barrymore , Professor Einstein and Tony the Wonder Horse at the Palace Theatre for 5 , with a free lunch thrown in . Roxy 's theatre is showing four feature films and giving away a room and bath for a dime . Another equally disastrous theatrical season , it is prophesied , and the show business will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who still have plenty of money . They are Policeman Meshbesher ( Hugh O'Connell ) and those other fortunates who have been able to buy a seat on the force . It is Mrs. Meshbesher ( Mary Boland ) who declares that she has so many diamonds " you can see me from Yonkers . " When Inquisitor Samuel Seabury ( see p. 13 ) threatens the policemen with an investigation , they decide to conceal their opulence by financing a revue , The Rhinestones of 1932 . High spot of this durbar , which must have cost Producer Sam H. Harris himself a good deal of money , is a lavish rhinestone Venetian scene , complete with half-a-dozen flights of rhinestone pigeons . <P> Face the Music slows up toward the end by the sheer weight of its extravagance in a courtroom scene in the Earl Carroll manner , but it would be a churlish critic indeed who would not admit that it is the most impressive musical show in town and one of the two funniest . <P> J. Harold Murray does most of the singing , assisted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth like a D on its back . Irving Berlin ( Israel Baline ) appears to have reopened a few old scores for his music , but " A Roof in Manhattan " is memorably tuneful . <P> Lou Holtz Revue . That impertinent comedian Lou Holtz has assembled two hours of first-rate vaudeville . Continuity lies in the fact that Mr. Holtz introduces the numbers . His talent includes Clark &; McCullough , Vincent Lopez 's orchestra and a concluding scene which depicts Paul Revere 's ride with a view of two lights shining from a miniature church steeple and a real horse galloping on a treadmill . <P> Collision . Olga ( June Walker ) pretends to be in love with a celebrated musician in order to spur the attentions of her real attachment , Dr. Gestzi ( Geoffrey Kerr ) . Unhappily the musician is reported missing in a train wreck . So Olga feigns insanity , declares that Dr. Gestzi is her missing fianc . Wise therapist , he humors her with a honeymoon , drugs her when she becomes unmaidenly and finally wakes up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Collision is adapted from the German by John Anderson , New York Journal theatre critic who revised The Fatal Alibi . His confreres did not fail to flay his present flimsy farce , observing that Critic Anderson would have done likewise .
