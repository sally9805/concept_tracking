Last week the U. S. took its place in a world at war . That enormous fact shaped the stratagems of statesmen and soldiers in Europe ( see p. 15 ) . It changed the shape of Government in Washington ( see p. 11 ) . It stirred and troubled The People , by whose consent alone the U. S. can go all the way to war . Upon no one man but upon all , its awful burden lay . To the man who more than any other can guide the U. S. toward or away from war , it was fascinating and profoundly stimulating . Franklin Roosevelt , man of crises , went into action as one who enjoys it . <P> The Two Neutralities ? As he had promised , the President laid down two sets of rules for U. S. Neutrality . In one set he conformed to international usage , in the other to Congressional statute . Ten days after they were drafted , two days after Great Britain declared war , Franklin Roosevelt released the first . It forbade aliens on U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed service with a belligerent . Others of its 17 rules forbade belligerent ships-of-war to use U. S. harbors for anything more than hurried ( 24 hour ) ports of call , to roam with intent to fight in U. S. waters , to chase one another in &; out of American ports , to take on at U. S. docks more fuel than enough to get them to their countries ' nearest ports , or to repair damage caused by battle at sea . <P> For five hours after this proclamation was issued , the U. S. lived by the rules of traditional Neutrality . Plane makers continued to speed battle craft toward embarkation points for Great Britain and France . Makers of guns , bombs , shells , gas , powder , etc. could have done the same had they had shipments to make. * Franklin Roosevelt was pleased to let this state of affairs sink in on Congress and the U. S. people ( 82% of whom in a Gallup poll blamed Hitler for the war ) . He then obeyed Congress , recognized that war prevailed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to belligerents in conformity with the Neutrality Act of 1937 . U. S. citizens had a view of statutory Neutrality in action . <P> Little was heard of its effects on U. S. trade , and for good reason . Exports of arms , munitions and related materials in World War I amounted at most to only 25% of total exports to the Allies . In the first six months of 1939 shipments of the materials now embargoed accounted for a peewee proportion of total U. S. exports . Still on the permitted export list were such war necessities as oil , steel , grains and other foodstuffs , even parachutes . <P> People in the U. S. quickly learned that neither Congress nor President has the final definition of " materials of war . " As it did in the first World War , to the vexation of the U. S. , Great Britain declared almost every conceivable necessity of life in wartime to be contraband and therefore subject to blockade ( see p. 22 ) , making paperwork of the Neutrality Act 's precise delineations between military and non-military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan 's Republican Senator Vandenberg , " whether we can become an arsenal for one belligerent without being the target for the other . I doubt if it is possible to be half in and half out of this war . ... "
