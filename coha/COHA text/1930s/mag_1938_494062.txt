Fair Tomorrow you HAVE ample justification for skepticism about the New York World 's Fair of 1939 . Past expositions serve as a warning . They have been too big , too dull and too commercial . If you care little about the internal mysteries of the gasoline engine or how synthetic rubber is born and if you are humanly susceptible to museum feet , you may have decided already that the World 's Fair will be something to avoid . If you live in New York you may even be planning a retreat between April 30 and November a , 1939 , to keep out of the way of the millions of onrushing Fair visitors . You may be quite right . It will certainly be hard to get a table at the International Casino next summer . But my guess is you 're wrong about the Fair . It is , of course , a commercial enterprise , backed by the nation 's most affluent business men , men who devote little time to giving more than they receive . Its sponsorship is veiled by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fair 's publicity experts have succeeded in establishing a quasi-public aura about the wonder city rising out of Flushing Meadows . All New York motorists , whether they care for the project or not , carry an advertising plug on their license plates . The government participates , but it does not control . Out of the total capital investment of $60,000,000 going into the show , $3o,000 , o00 is government money . The federal coffers contribute $3,500,000 , New York State $6,500,00o and New York City $20,000,000 . For its money the federal government gets the largest single exhibit hall at the head of the central mall . The state and city get a series of permanent buildings , a permanent park site complete with trees that is worth $100000,000 and the prospect of a billion dollars ' worth of business in the Greater New York area . But control of the show is in the hands of the Fair Administration acting in the faintly blurred interest of the Fair corporation and its thousands of bondholders , who have subscribed approximately $30,000,000 for four-percent paper which will mature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are the business men , of whom Mr. Grover A. Whalen is the prototype and head man . Their job is to " put the Fair over , " to persuade exhibitors to come , to sprinkle newspaper offices with neat releases , to officiate at Last Rivet ceremonies and to send off distinguished aviators . They are the Barnums , the barkers in cutaways . Mr. Whalen 's colleagues on the Fair 's staff tell me he is doing a first-rate job ; that he works hard and long and painstakingly . But his task is primarily a salesman 's . The second group within the Administration , and to me the more interesting one , is that of the industrial designers , architects and social scientists who see the Fair as a first-class medium for presenting their ideas to a large , receptive audience . Out on Flushing Meadows the men who are punching the Fair into its final physical shape have made astounding progress . The opening day is five months away , but there are already enough miles of finished walks , roadways and exhibit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven through the grounds in one of the khaki-colored station wagons that form the second-string fleet of official cars ( the speedometer on mine showed 7,403 miles ) . At its present stage your first impression of the Fair , and a powerful one , is the bold and effective use of color . Earlier expositions have been chromatically dull : Chicago in 1893 was nearly all white , like the Buffalo exposition in 19o1 and St. Louis in 1904 . Texas in 1936 was tawny yellow . Chicago in 1933 used a few familiar colors experimentally . New York in 5939 will be all the colors of the spectrum . In airplane view the main avenues which radiate from the Theme Center of the Fair form a wheel , with the Trylon and Perisphere as the hub . And each of these avenues has been assigned a primary color . From the warm , off-white of the Theme Center the hues along each street will increase in intensity as one gets farther and farther from the central axis , and the buildings and murals and plants will all be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the color ranges from white through the pastel shades of yellow to gold at its extremify . On Constitution Mall the series is through the reds to burgundy , and on the Avenue of Pioneers from the pale blues to ultramarine . A Fair visitor , confused by the bigness of it all , can approximate his distance from the center of things by a glance at the color of the nearest flower or building . Two details about the care with which this color idea is being executed are worth mention . One is that the botanical experts are conducting a series of tests in their special flower beds to determine the exact hues of certain species that have seldom been grown before in these parts . They are also noting the exact tones of fading flowers . The Fair will be as continuously in bloom as is possible : the hundreds of beds containing approximately 2,000,000 plants will be replanted three times during the summer ( if the Fair lasts no longer ) . But fading plants will have to wither in hues suitable to the basic color-scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors in the murals and on the exteriors of buildings . Architects have never used outdoor colors to such an extent before . And be . cause many of the pigments had to be especially devel aped for the Fair 's use , they are bound to fade during its existence . So in a special paint-testing enclosure these colors have been exposed to the winds and heat and rain of Flushing Meadows for nearly two years . The color experts , even though they ca n't prevent the fading , have charted its rate . The colors now being applied are too bright , but by design . In August , 1939 , when the Fair is half over , they will have faded to precisely the intensity the artists prescribed . The physical size of the Fair unsettled my original , comfortable attitude of skepticism . We drove up beside the framework of the Perisphere and Trylon , the Fair 's trademark and most widely publicized single attraction . The ball and spike appear on the official stationery , on the uniforms of the special police , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all over the multitudes of souvenir buttons , pins and badges . But I 'd never been impressed by the thing until I sat there at its base , staring up at the intricate , orange steel frame . That ball has an interior twice the size of the inside of Radio City Music Hall . The triangular obelisk beside it rises loo feet , about 1 so feet beyond the top of the Washington Monument . Every six minutes an audience of 6,000 will be able to ride up to the belly of the perisphere in glass-enclosed escalators and step out onto a revolving platform , seemingly just suspended in space . In fact , the entire structure appears to be floating in air , because the solid-steel supports that now thrust down reassuringly into the gravel and mud will be sheathed in mirrors and set into a little lake blanketed in mist . If the visitor can control his terror at hanging inside a huge ball which is itself merely drifting on a cloud , he may look down into the shiny metropolis of tomorrow , " Democracity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have pooled their foresight . More than half the exhibit halls are finished . The interiors and the exhibits themselves are still to come , but their shells are in place . There has been criticism of the Fair 's architectural pattern ; it is said the buildings look like dull rows of boxes , that the lack of windows is an example of " functionalism " carried beyond the point of common-sense usefulness , that their construction is flimsy . The murals have also been attacked . Some of the artists are accused of unoriginality or ugliness , others of obscurity . Knowing nothing about architecture except what I see in the movies , I nevertheless disagree with the critics on the first score . The buildings have no windows because every time you cut a hole in a wall you destroy the exhibit space inside . They have an interesting variety of shapes : the Maritime Building , for example , with two huge pillars of concrete like ocean liners ' prows rising up beside the main entrance , or the Aviation Building , a conventionalized replica of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the architects whose buildings are to last not more than two years . This Fair 's exhibit halls are the antitheses of the marble palaces of Chicago in 1893 ; they are quick and gay and reckless . Perhaps you can complain with more justification about the Fair 's art . Lots of the murals are dull and self-conscious and in the Radio City style which I do n't happen to like ; big circus women with round contours and no clothes , holding an assortment of lightning bolts or a plowshare and representing , according to the legend , The World of Tomorrow , Freedom of Speech or the Way to the Ladies ' Room . But , in fairness , there is more that I like than not , especially a big red mural on the back of the Food Building by Carlo Campaglia and a spiral chrome-steel fountain in the court of the Science and Education Building . And the idea behind the free-handed use of color , murals and sculptures is admirable . Art is shown to be fun , not just something to be stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a comfortable , useful thing like the rug on the floor for everybody 's house and everyman 's office . I shall be surprised , along with the Fair 's art-planning board , if this attitude as it is carried out here does not spill over into the building and decoration tomorrow . Like everybody else who has written about the Fair , I 'm letting myself get off on its least important aspects . The sheer acreage is impressive . I have a hard time avoiding a catalogue of gadgets . What I have to say about the Fair , and the only thing that may escape the attention of the editors who are already laying out page after page of Sunday-supplement features for the long hard winter , is that there is a good chance the Fair will get across some ideas to its 30,000 , - 000 visitors ( who will each pay three admissions ) . All Fairs have had themes , but most of them were accidental . The impresarios have looked back after the gates were closed and said ( as they did after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now , this fair was pretty important because its most dramatic event was the arrival of the first automobile ever to travel from New York to St. Louis under its own power and this marks the birth of America 's greatest new industry . " But the New York World 's Fair has a solid idea of its message in advance . It is to sing the praises and underscore the possibilities of the democratic form of government . This sounds several shades too noble for a high-pressure commercial venture , but it 's important to remember the dual-control group running the show . A sort of tug-of-war has gone on between the coalmen:ix interests and the social theorists to determine whose work shall dominate . The artists , engineers and social , planners of the second category are interested in showing what America of tomorrow could be like if we would utilize the material skills their laboratories have id . ready developed . They want to show that democracy is the form of government best suited for maximum utilization ; to stress the " interdependence of man , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dictatorship has developed to a fine point the technique of singing its own praises . And in a sense the World 's Fair is an experiment in the same art , but for a democracy . When the New York Fair had just begun , the directors gathered together an advisory board of ninety-six professional men and women . They were educators and social theorists , artists and designers , journalists , engineers and social workers without any interest in a commercial exhibition . Their job was to develop a theme for the fair . Its fundamental point was there , of course , from the outset . Any fair is designed to plug the products of its exhibitors . But , with the experience of all previous exhibitors to go by , the directors realized that the public must be offered something more . To the panel of ninety-six consultants this extra something was the important thing . The business men acknowledge the soundness of the principle . They know they can not be na ? vely direct in their selling campaigns . If the Galoshes Hall were to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My-T-Dry Galoshes the fickle audience would soon wander off . The business men are in favor of the theme on that account . It gives the Fair a valid excuse for being . In the long run , the " message " of the Fair is in their interest as well , and many recognize the fact . The Fair hopes to reduce the long lag between invention and merchandising . Everyone is familiar with this phenomenon of our economy ? the way useful inventions remain on the laboratory shelf either through the lack of interest on the part of the consumer or because the manufacturer 's till is best served by their suppression . But by showing the practical use of many present inventions and developments ? plastics , building materials , textiles , glass ? the Fair hopes to bring up public demand for the new products to a point where their marketing will be possible . In non-commercial fields the same idea will be stressed . In housing , for example , the Fair 's exhibit will include a small section of a model community ? a greenbelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their maximum . In traffic control the road engineers will present model and life-size roads incorporating the best available ideas for safety and efficiency . Similar stories will be told in soil conservation , public health , education and transportation in the most dramatic , visual forms . There will be a conspicuous absence of trade names and trade-marked-product advertising . In some industries ? automobiles , for example -- where product competition is especially bitter , trade names will be stressed , but in many industries competing firms have banded together , played down their individual identities , and are concentrating on selling their industry 's service . Twenty-six Eastern railroads are cooperating to show , not that the New York Central has got the New Haven beat a mile , but that travel by rail is safe , comfortable and cheap . The insurance companies together are selling , not policies , but longer , more healthful life ; exhibits on how to eat and dress and keep from getting killed crossing streets . The duPont Company , as another example , is going to talk primarily about the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may dislike the du-Pont empire , its contributions to our industrial knowledge are tremendous . DuPont is showing some of the most important things it has produced during the past fifteen years : the paints and enamels , the artificial textiles , the development of dyes , the completely nontoxic refrigerant , perfumes , dyes and the fascinating variety of new plastics . The government itself plans an impressive exhibit , in sharp contrast to the dull , departmentalized performances it has put on in the past . It is the largest exhibit , a $1 , soo , 000 hall at the eastern end of Constitution Mall , the central axis of the grounds . Instead of following the old pattern of having each government agency present its separate story , the exhibit will be divided into twelve functional sections : conservation , food , shelter , trade , finance , transportation and communication , social welfare , education , arts and recreation , etc . The story of the government 's enormous participation in each field will be told in short , snappy dramatic form . It should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar than has ever before been presented in these United States . The whole theme will emphasize , using propaganda weapons borrowed from dictators , how much more a democratic system , interested in the welfare of everybody , can do . This Fair is so big and there is so much detail to talk about that it seems a shame to have an article end . Especially without discussing such charming exhibits as the Future of the Cow , which , it seems , ought to be a city-dweller , living in air-conditioned offices , milked by the rotolactor ( merry-go-round milking machine ) and fed a special diet of vitamin capsules . Or without explaining the wonders of the pyrotechnic display , the combination color-organ , symphony orchestra , searchlight , fountain display and noiseless fireworks exhibit which will play special compositions by Mr. Labatut of Princeton University over the cool waters of the Lagoon of Nations . There 's been room for nothing about the exhibitions of contemporary American art , or about the comprehensive musical jubilee that is planned , nothing about the foreign exhibits , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get to the Fair from the surrounding area every hour . But no matter . You 'll probably go and see for yourself .
