In Alaska in winter and spring , everybody talks about the weather and nearly everybody does something about it . Midstream in the ice-locked Tanana River at Nenana , a Government railroad junction , some 60 mi. southwest of Fairbanks , a 25-ft. pole stands upright , frozen fast . " Nenana Ice Pool ' ' reads a sign that it holds aloft . From the pole a wire runs ashore to the trigger of a time clock . During the early spring , Alaskans pay $1 for a chance to guess the exact day , hour and minute that the ice will move far enough down the Tanana to take up the 100 ft. of slack in the wire and trip the time trigger . To the winner of this elemental lottery , begun in 1917 , goes the pool . <P> Last week as the temperature rose steadily , the Tanana ice-jam began moving , drawing the wire taut . At 8:04 p. m . May 12 the trigger was tripped , the clock stopped , making Mervin E. Anderson , 31-year-old Fairbanks bus driver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some $75,000 richer . Day before Guesser Anderson split with another guesser the $3,500 first prize in another similar pool based on the movement of ice in the Chena River at Fairbanks .
