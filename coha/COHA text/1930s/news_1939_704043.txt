txt From the deck of an American destroyer flying the royal standard . at her masthead for the first time in history , England 's sailor King and Scottish Queen stepped ashore at the Battery yesterday to receive the applause and cheers , if not the homage , of half the people of this , the New World 's greatest city . When King George VI and Queen Elizabeth left Columbia University yesterday for their seventy-eight mile drive to Hyde Park , where they were to be the guests of the President and Mrs. Roosevelt through today , they had driven over a fiftyone mile city route packed solidly with cheering crowds . The refusal of Scotland Yard to sanction the King 's following the traditional route of celebrities , through the towering concrete and . steel canyon of lower Broadway , for fear some enthusiastic welcomer might throw a telephone book without tearing it up first , prevented the royal visitors from seeing much of the city . It did not , however , prevent the people of New York from seeing them . Drive Up Express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor Lehman and Mayor La Guardia , who rode with them to the World 's Fair , where thousands stood for hours to see them pass in the trackless train , the King and Queen drove in an open car with bulletproof glass up the express highway to Seventy-second Street . Seventy thousand tickets , each good for two , were issued for standing room on the downtown ramp of the elevated highway , which runs up the west side of Manhattan past steamship docks , warehouses and ether nondescript buildings . At the last moment the police were ordered to admit all who sought admittance to the highway on foot as long as there was room . There were not many vacant spots along the highway . Across Severity-second Street and along the drive in Central Park , where school children waved the Stars and Stripes and the Union Jack , the crowds were thicker . The children , familiar with the air if not the words of " God Save the King , " sang the British national anthem as the King 's car passed. , Along Ninety-sixth Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queens end of the Triborough Bridge and the Fair Grounds there was an unbroken line of cheering persons on both sides of the road . Return Trip Is Hour Late Returning late in the afternoon nearly an hour behind their ached -- ule because of their reluctance to leave the Fair , where they received . scores of British war veterans and distinguished Britishers at a sort of miniature Buckingham Palace garden party , the King and Queen passed through crowds that packed . the sidewalks fro n curbstone to building line from the bridge to Columbia University . From Ninetyfifth Street far into Westchester the royal route was lined with specta ? tors . At Columbia , where they were greeted by Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler , university president , on the steps of the library before a cheer ? ing crowd , the King and Queen went through another little ritual emphasizing the cultural ties between . the United States and Enge /and . In the fifteen minutes they , spent there King George viewed a , portrait of an earlier George Rex , who signed the charter that established Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and . Queen inspected the original char ? ter itself . The enthusiasm and admiration . which the serious young King and . the smiling Queen evoked among those who saw them only fleetingly , and from afar was more than . matched by those who enjoyed , closer and more intimate contact with them during their six-hour visit . The three principal hosts of , the royal visitors during their stop in New York , the first any reigning King of England has ever made , agreed that they were most impressed by the human understanding and kindliness of the King and Queen . Mayor La Guardia , Governor Lehman and dr . Whalen all agreed that the King and Queen were warm-hearted and likable young persons . Throughout the visit the Mayor , the Governor and the president of the World 's Fair sought to I minimize the formal aspects of the occasion and stress its human phases , and last night they felt satisfied that in doing so they had adopted the right course . The Mayor , in discussing his ride through the city with the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the royal party can do . He quoted the King and Queen , and while that may shock some sticklers for form in England , the Mayor 's interview , if it can be called that , affords the first opportunity of the American people to know that the King and Queen are both interested and well informed regarding this country and its problems as well as those of England . It revealed that the Queen , who seems to like the spotlight and the applause of crowds , believes " there is nothing nicer in the world than friendship . " Sees Treaty of Friendship Summing up his impression of the visit , the Mayor said : " As I left the royal couple at Columbia University , I told the King that I thought their visit had negotiated a treaty of friendship ' that would take many years to revoke , and that his visit did more good than the sending of a dozen ambassadors or the interchange of fifty diplomatic notes . " The Mayor quoted the King as having replied : " It is very kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association with the royal visitors , the Mayor said : " They seemed to know a great deal about the layout of the city , and they asked many questions about it . I do n't know whether it is just my own disappointment about not being able to bring them up Fifth Avenue and Broadway , but I gathered that they would have preferred that route . As we drove up the West Side Highway both the King and Queen asked several times how far we were from Broadway , and how far from Fifth Avenue They were very much interested in Broadway . " Of course the mist over the river this morning prevented them from getting a very complete picture of the city 's skyline . But they did get a good view of the Empire State Building as we rode north , and seemed quite interested in it . ' While we traveled north , they inquired about the kind of section we were traveling through , and the abrupt change from the piers and factories along the highway south of Seventy-second Street to the Riverside Drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They asked about the Triborough Bridge  --  how long it had been built , how much it had cost and who built it , I told them it had been built by an independent agency of the city , and the King wanted to know whether it was self-supporting . I said it would pay for itself . Similarly , the King and Queen asked about the North Beach Airport in Queens , and I told them it would cost $40,000,000 . The King was much interested in the fact that we were using unemployed labor on the airport , and he remarked that that was a ' very good thing . ' Asks About Unemployed " The King asked how many unemployed we had in the city , and I told him the total was - somewhere around 300,000 . His reaction as well as the Queen 's indicated that they were quite familiar with the unemployment problem . " At one point in Queens there was a section that did not seem to be covered well , and a large crowd of people surged downhill to fill it Up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in bounds , and the King remarked , as if voicing his thoughts : " ' Do n't worry  --  the crowd always takes care of itself . ' " The Queen seemed very pleased at the warmth and sincerity of the city 's greeting . She remarked to me : " ' There is nothing nicer in the world than friendship . Friendship is about the best thing in the world , is n't it ? ' I replied that it was indeed . She asked about the number of policemen we had , and seemed surprised when I told her it was near 20,000 . I also told the Queen and King that we had 1,600 , - 000 school children and 36,000 teachers . Her Majesty was much impressed with those figures . " Both of them are intensely human , and really interested in people , and they have much more knowledge of social conditions than one would expect of a fairybook King . They seemed to be most impressed with the size of the city , the friendliness of its people and the very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also quite impressed with the World 's Fair  --  the King told me that the Glasgow Fair had paid for itself , and he also remarked that he had once been president of a Fair , but had been too busy ever to go and see it . " I will say this : They were much easier to entertain and to live with for a day than a great many other I guests I have had . " Speaking for Mrs. Lehman as well as himself , the Governor said : " We found the royal couple most gracious  --  kindly , simple and altogether delightful . I was very much impressed with the great warmth and cordiality of the reception accorded to them , both in the city and at the Fair . It was one of the most sincerely cordial welcomes I have ever seen . It shows the close bond between the democracy of America and the English democracy . " Whalen Issues Statement In a statement issued in the evening , Grover A. Whalen , president of the Fair Corporation , said : " The Fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen Elizabeth today . Their visit was a great success from every viewpoint . Their graciousness and charm , their friendliness for America and Americans , were evidenced in many ways . " They displayed a surprising knowledge of the New York Fair . They had , in fact , studied the Fair 's plans and were deeply impressed by the landscaping , the architecture and the exhibit buildings . " They were delighted with the very warm reception accorded them and I am sure they departed with a deeper feeling of friendship for the people of America . " We , of the Fair Corporation , feel that the visit of King George and Queen Elizabeth was an event of lasting importance  --  a step forward of international good will . It was a great day for the Fair , a great day for New York and a great day for America . " Make Spectacular Arrival The most spectacular and impressive event in the whole crowded day was seen only by the correspondents with the official party at the Sandy Hook Coast Guard station , where the royal visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Bay to the Battery . Leaving the car in which they had driven from Red Bank , N. J. , to Fort Hancock through the estates that line the Rumson Road , the King in formal morning clothes and the Queen in a becoming dress of blue walked to the gangway of the warship , spick and span beneath a fresh coat of paint . The guns of the Coast Guard Cutter Campbell , anchored just offshore , boomed a royal salute , which was repeated by Fort Hancock 's heavier artillery . The crew , in spotless white , lined the rails standing stiffly at salute . The instant the King and Queen were aboard , the grim-looking gray ship , guns bristling from its armored turrents , moved slowly out of her berth and at the same moment the royal standard broke from its mainmast . As it flew in the breeze displaying the crests of England , Scotland , Ireland and Wales on its gold background , it seemed a token of the friendly understanding between the two countries  --  an understanding that both the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day was hazy and overcast so that the Statue of Liberty and the famed skyline of lower Manhattan were obscured behind a misty curtain until the Warrington was close upon them . Still , the King and Queen seemed impressed by the high buildings , and the Queen stared up at them as many another less distinguished visitor has done when first stepping foot upon this soil . As the King and Queen went ashore the cutter Campbell , which had followed the Warrington up the bay , fired another twenty-one gun salute while other craft in the harbor cut loose with whistles and sirens . One of the greatest crowds that ever has squeezed itself into downtown Manhattan cheered itself hoarse . Every window overlooking the scene was packed with faces and even the roofs were crowded . The Governor was the first to address the King with a short simple word of welcome . Mayor La Guardia also was concise and clear in telling England 's sovereigns that they were welcome ' guests in his city . he King nodded and the Queen smiled . Both the Mayor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their backs to the King and Queen as the procession started . No Englishman would have done it , but it was excusable since the car in which they were riding was not built or equipped for royalty . All the royal cars used by the King in England have seats that fold the wrong way , making it easier to follow the rule and still be comfortable . Seldom has there been a heavier concentration of policemen in the city than was used to guard the progress of the royal visitors . All but 4,000 of the 18,000 were called upon to help in some way . Four thousand were on duty in the Fair Grounds alone and the rest were posted at intervals all along the route of the procession from the Battery to the Westchester County line . English newspaper men with the official party commented on the ease with which police controlled the throngs without ropes or other barriers to help them . Ring Has Speed Reduced The procession started from the Battery at a rate of thirty miles an hour  --  a speed which Scotland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit , had requested as a safety measure . The King soon put a stop to that by asking one of the motorcycle policemen escorting his car to tell Police Commissioner Lewis J. Valentine , whose car led the procession , to reduce the speed . The King said he wanted " to take it all in . " From that time on the twentyodd cars in the procession moved along at about 15 miles an hour so that thousands who might otherwise have caught the most fleeting of glimpses of England 's monarch and his consort were able to see for themselves that they were pleasant , fresh-faced young persons who have been cast to play a role in history land are trying their best to play it well . The King and Queen rode in an open car both going to the Fair and returning , although the skies were threatening and several times light rain ' fell . Before starting for Hyde Park , however , they changed to a sedan , and it was well that they did for it rained heavily soon afterward . Heavy Guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the visitors was no heavier than that provided in New Jersey , where Governor A. Harry Moore and Mayor Charles R. English welcomed the visitors in the morning upon the arrival of the royal train . Regular soldiers with fixed bayonets lined the tracks and formed a solid wall at the station . All along the road to the Coast Guard station soldiers with rifles guarded the highway . ' Yet nowhere was there an unfriendly gesture or untoward incident . Along the Rumson Road , as in New York , school children waved British flags and sang patriotic songs of this country and of England . At one place near Point Pleasant the rector of an Episcopal church , a. cross dangling from his neck , stood in his surplice at the roadside with his choir in their vestments , singing " God Save the King . " Police regulations and restrictions made the city 's greeting to the King and Queen more decorous and restrained than some accorded in the past to Charles A. Lindbergh and others whose feats have caught the imagination . None , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the King Emperor and his Queen .
