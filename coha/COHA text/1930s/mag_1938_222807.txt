Many would be the jobs lost , the careers ruined , were U. S. Democratic Party Leader Franklin Delano Roosevelt to ape Italian Fascist Party Leader Benito Mussolini in prescribing gymnastic tests for his party henchmen . Doubtful it is that sickly , 64-year-old Speaker William Bankhead of the House of Representatives , could pass a rope-skipping examination ; that suffering Harry L. Hopkins , Federal relief administrator , would survive a pole-vaulting test ; that Senate Majority Leader Alben Barkley would fare well with the broad jump , or that bald , short House Majority Leader Sam Rayburn could throw a discus very far . <P> To horseback-riding , fencing , airplane-piloting , swimming , skiing Leader Mussolini , the traditional politician 's ample paunch is evidence of a decadence not to be tolerated in his Party . Il Duce 's news-organ Il Popolo d'Italia laid the law down recently : " Excessively fat members are undesirable in the Party ranks . . . . Their hearts , minds , nerves and muscles are all Fascist , but their bellies , no ! " To Rome last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fascist Party . In the Forum Mussolini , with Il Duce watching , with pantherlike Fascist Secretary Achille Starace leading , the testees swam , jumped through blazing hoops , leaped from springboards over hedges of bayonets , tanks and armored cars . Casualties : Falls on bayonet points for two secretaries , a scorching for another , a chest injury for an inspector who landed on a tank .
