txt Liquor and Potato Bugs . To the Editor of The New York Times : The curative methods and suggestions offered by those who would make the Volstead law more effective in practice , and particularly recent pronouncements from some of our Senators , must remind some of us older ones of the early stages of the war against the Colorado beetle or common potato bug . Our farmers were discouraged , as the little striped pest seemed to thrive upon all ordinary forms of poison . Finally , there appeared in several of our agricultural papers the following advertisement : " Sure death to potato bugs ; $1,000 forfeit for any case of failure where directions are followed . ' Simple . Safe . Sure . Send $1 for full-size package . " In course of time the package arrived and contained two neatly made wood blocks , labeled No. 1 and No. 2 . Directions : " Place bug upon Block No. 1 and press firmly with Block No. 2 . Repeat as before . " It never failed when used properly . FRANK O. FOSTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
