BOTHERSOME question , modern as can be : If trains are indeed air-conditioned , as advertised , why does the porter still want to brush you off with a whiskbroom at the end of the journey ?

It seems that the P. S. C. requires Edison to give every customer a credit rating of zero . This was a blow to us , as we had thought some about bringing a damage suit against Edison on the ground that a threat note impaired our digestion , which in turn unfitted us for work , thus constituting a damage . But we ca n't fight the Public Service Commission . It 's too big , and to sort of vague  --  like a Macy balloon . ( P. S. We paid the bill . ) EVER since the Times put that flashing news dingus on its building , we have been waiting for a typographical error  --  or perhaps we should say a Mazdagraphical error .

Skiers are in the hills now , riding to the crests in taxis , greasing their run-ners with mysterious substances . Skiing has become a cult , like that of the horse . We passed Stratton 's barn not long ago ; the slope had been graded , and the barn stuccoed and made into a house . We wondered , recalling certain brave , clear winter moments , whether sliding downhill is n't perhaps something that only children and Norwegians do really well . TT 'S a rare manufacturer who really I believes in his own product . Automobile men certainly do n't believe in automobiles or they would install speedometers capable of recording trips of more than 99.9 miles . Twenty years ago , 99.9 miles was a good day 's run and the three-digit trip-indicator was adequate ; but occasionally , in these speed-mad times , one hears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the hundreds of miles . One would think the manufacturers would show some interest in this problem . To us it is purely academic , for in a long life of motoring we have not once remembered to set the trip-indicator at the start of the journey . And if you do n't set it , it 's worse than as though it did n't exist , tempting the driver to compute mileage starting from a guess and ending with the realization that it does n't matter anyway . AFTER a show the other night , we AFTE wandered idly into the Hotel Astor , brooding on when the rainy season was going to begin again in Ethiopia , and looking for the longest bar in the world . " Where 's the longest bar in the world ? " we finally asked a groom . He mumbled some ridiculous directions , and after another short , fruitless hunt we shuffled along home and had a bottle of beer , dreaming of the wars and of the days when things were n't so big you could n't even find them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has spent the past fifteen years playing chess in the University Club , accosted us on the street the other day and asked , " What is the match game ? " " Well , " we said , " if you stand around in a bar-and-grill and shake dice for rounds of drinks , you 're nobody , probably . But if you play the match game for rounds of drinks , or for lunch , you 're a member of a certain set . You 're Dashiell Hammett . You 're Lillian Hellman You 're Ben Hecht . You may even be Lucius Beebe . " " Good God ! " our friend murmured . " And how is it played ? " " With matches , " we told him . " Three matches . Any number of persons may play , and each may hold in his playing hand one , two , or three matches , or none at all . The point of the game is to guess the total number of matches in the hands of all the players , the guess going clockwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same number ; when everybody has guessed , the players all open their hands , and if any player has guessed the correct total he drops out . This goes on until there are only two players left ; then one of the two has to guess right twice before he can drop nut . The loser in this final elimination buys a round of drinks for everybody . " " Thank you , " said our friend , hurrying back to the University Club for more chess . This all started us thinking about the match game , and we finally sought out one of its more scholarly players , who has delved into its history . He said that the game has been played in New York since 1924 , although it did n't become popular until 1934 . As far as this man 's researches take him , it was played at the Bristol Cafe in Marseilles back in 1919 , moving from there to Harry 's New York Bar in Paris . A German acquaintance of ours told us that when he was a child in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very like it  --  not for rounds of Scotch-and-soda , though . A man who travels in the Orient quite a bit said that fifteen years ago the Siamese singsong girls played it at all the bars in Bangkok , staking their honor against a round of drinks , and often getting pretty tipsy . Another thing that 's been pointed out is that the match game is similar in principle to the Italian game of Morro , which is played with the fingers . There 's no great amount of skill to the match game until the number of players is narrowed down to two . All you have to do up to that point is rely on the law of averages ; if six persons are playing , the total number of matches that can possibly be held is eighteen , and the probable number is nine . ( There 's another school of thought which holds that the probable number is twelve . ) But with two playing , there 's a trick : you guess three ( because that gives no clue to the number you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of matches which , added to what you think your opponent is holding , makes three . Any other guess is unorthodox ; might win , of course , but it would still he unorthodox . Seasoned players have all sorts of superstitions : some prefer paper matches , some the kitchen variety ; others get attached to a certain trio of lucky matches , and carry them around for weeks . One man had some made of silver ; they have n't brought him much luck , especially . In the spring of 1935 , Dr. Charles Francis Potter , head of the First Humanist Society , preached a sermon denouncing the match game . Said it caused excessive drinking , and that playing for money was reprehensible , and probably degrading . Just before Ivar Kreuger 's death , several match-players were working on him to put up a trophy , on the theory that it would be good for business . He was mulling it over when hell broke loose .

A short time ago , while they were working to stimulate interest in a poll they were taking to determine President Roosevelt 's popularity , a letter arrived which they wanted to read over the air . It was postmarked Lagrange , Georgia , and signed by a Fannie Oz-burn , aged thirteen . After expressing the opinion that Mr. Roosevelt should be elected again , this problem child went on to say , " He 's the best man who has been in the United States since Jesus Christ left . " MPC would n't allow the letter to be read on the broadcast . Did n't explain or anything  --  just said no . Dark Contralto OU 'D have to go far to find a 1. person more quiet and modest than Marian Anderson , the young Negress whose contralto voice is , as you probably know , the latest sensation of the musical world . We called on her while she was here for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in a Y.W.C.A. in Harlem ; it 's not improbable that she will make use of the same unpretentious diggings when she comes to town for her next recital  --  Carnegic Hall , on the twentieth . She has n't even bought herself a car . She plans to live , between concerts , with her mother and her two young sisters in a little brick house she bought in Philadelphia 's colored section . She has been in Europe since 1931 , and is still startled by her success there . " Why , " she says , " we gave a hundred and fifty concerts in Scandinavia alone last year . " " We " includes Kosti Ve hanen , who has been her accompanist for the past five years . He 's white  --  Finnish . When we saw Miss Anderson , she had her foot in a cast and walked with crutches , recovering from a broken ankle ; it will be all right by January 20th , she said . She wore an inexpensive-looking gray fur coat and a plain green dress . She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large and mobile mouth . There 's no trace of a Southern Negro accent in her voice . When she 's talking to you , Miss Anderson frowns a lot , amiably , and once in a while gives you a broad wink . She told us she was born in a Negro neighborhood in South Philadelphia . Her father sold ice and coal , and her mother took in washing ; the family lived in a single rented room . They all used to sing spirituals on rainy Sundays , to keep cheerful . When Marian was six years old , she made her first concert appearance ; sang a duet , " The Lord Is My Shepherd , " with another pickaninny at a service in a neighborhood Baptist church . When she was eight , she received her first money for singing in public  --  half a dollar ; she was billed as a " baby contralto . " Her father died soon after this , and several Negro organizations advanced money for her to study seriously . In the summer of 1925 she heat three hundred other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stadium , accompanied by the Philharmonic . Then she went to Europe to study further , returning in 1931 to give a recital , which won her gond notices and enabled her to move her mother and sisters into a better neighborhood . Then her next European tour , from which she has only just returned . Her repertoire at present includes some hundred and twenty-five songs . She practices when she feels like it  --  perhaps ten hours one day and not at all the next . She plays tennis , and swims a little , for relaxation . She told us ( with a broad wink ) that she had followed the career of Joe Louis with great interest , and would like to meet him some time . We sounded her out about superstitions ; she said she had none of her own , but once a woman told her it would bring her luck if she always sang with a certain little handkerchief in her hand . Marian , the soul of amiability , tried k , but it did n't seem to make much difference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautious as well as amiable . " Who is your favorite composer ? " we asked . " I have n't one , " she said , " but if I had one , it would be Schubert . " " What is your favorite song ? " we pursued . " I have no favorite song , " she told us , " but if I did have one , it would be Schubert 's ' Ave Maria . ' " Two Dozen AN elegant little Japanese walked in- to Browning , King 's one afternoon last week , and approached the man behind the necktie counter  --  a Mr. Ernest Schwartz , as it happened . Evidently he was one of those Japs who feel more at home with the written word , for he conducted his part of the transaction entirely with pad and pencil . First he wrote : " Ties , six blue six gray " Mr. Schwartz showed him some plain ties , and said they were a dollar and a half each . The customer paid the eighteen dollars ( plus tax ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wrote on the pad : " How do I get to Macy 's ? " Mr. Schwartz told him how to get to Macy 's , saw him out the door , and forgot all about him . In a couple of hours , though , there he was again . He produced his little pad and pencil and wrote : " Ties , six blue six gray " Mr. Schwartz wrapped him up another dozen ties , and rang up another **25;771;TOOLONG . " What happened to the others ? " he asked . The lap looked at him blandly , seized his pad , and wrote the fourth and last little chapter of his strange tale : " Lost them in Macy 's " sass Fliegelhorn APROPOS of " The Music Goes . E ' Round and Around , " a Mr. Wiesenberger , who runs a pawnshop , told us the other day that people in his line of business have lately had a delight ful surprise : old French horns , mellophones , and circular trumpets , especially the more battered and impractical-looking ones , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minor consequence of the sudden popularity of the song which you have all read about in the newspapers , and may even have heard played over the radio ; every dance orchestra needs an eccentric ' round-and-around instrument ( with at least three valves ) for its presentation of the number . The horn which inspired the music is the property of Mike Riley , co-com- poser , with one Ed Farley , of the tune . The words are by a Mr. Hodgson , a trombonist with a travelling orchestra , who used to sing them to the melody of " Dinah , " until Riley and Farley got hold of them and wrote a new tune . Riley bought the horn years ago in a pawnshop in Pittsburgh , and has been using it alternately as a musical instrument and a comedy prop . He says it has a deepish trombone sound , but he does n't know the instrument 's name . A gentleman at Wurlitzer 's , after looking at its picture on the front of the sheet music , pronounced it a bass Fliigelhorn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A greater mystery , we thought , was the origin of that yodel , " Whoa-hohoho , ho-ho , " which we hear wafted from speeding taxicabs in the early morning when we are trying to sleep . We asked the Messrs . Riley and Farley if this was Amerindian , or had they just thought it up , or what ? " It 's just a hot Iick , " they said ; then , seeing that we did n't exactly follow this , explained , " You know , when you get a lot of fellows jamming , somebody will put in hot licks . Like ' Whoa-hohoho , ho-ho . ' " That cleared that up fine . The Onyx Club , up on Fifty-second Street , where Riley and Farley hold forth , used to he a hangout for musicians with a spare hour or so ; lately it has been crowded with white ties from Princeton , and the headwaiter has bought a tuxedo , and a velvet rope for keeping back the crowd . The boys have continued to play there , but they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot more stage work . Each has made about five thousand dollars from the sale of sheet music , and a substantial something on the sale of records . Radio brings them nothing , for some reason . They have been photographed with Mrs. Vincent Astor , and the Business Men 's Association of Newark is planning a celebration in honor of Newark 's distinguished native son , Mr. Farley . But what convinced the boys that they had arrived was the call of a newsboy in Times Square . " Get your morning " brier-loan , Doily News , and Mirror , whoa-hohoho , ho-ho , " he carolled , and then , diminuendo , " And your New York Times . " " When I heard that , " Mr. Farley told us , " I knew we was in . " Old Philadelphia Lady IT 'S awfully , awfully late for it Christ-.1 mas tale , but news gets through slowly from Philadelphia . In that reputable and imperishable city , on Christmas morning , an elderly lady found herself confronted by a neighbor 's little boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yelled , " Merry Christmas , old lady ! " For an instant she struggled with a whole battery of odd , conflicting emotions . Then her wavering voice shattered the frosty air . " Merry Christmas , had boy ! " she replied . Grown-Up HIGH-HO , how time flies ! Nathalia Crane , once the Shirley Temple of poetry , is twenty-two years old now , and the author of a volume of grownup verse soon to be published by Random House , Our benevolent interest in Random House , poetry , and maidens of twenty-two , combined with a sudden impulse , took us over to Brooklyn Heights last Saturday to call on Nathaha . She lives with her father and mother at 36 Pierrepont Street , in two rooms of a remodelled brownstone house . Our heart was all aflutter , like the washing on the line , but Nathalia , having been the subject of more interviews than you could shake a stick at , put us at our ease : gave us the most comfortable chair beside the fire , made tea and cinnamon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even twitch when we mentioned the janitor 's boy ; just said she had no idea what had become of him , " Some reporters found a redheaded boy named Roger Jones , " she added . " But he was four years too old . " Nathalia is slim , dark , large-eyed , soft-spoken , and in general resembles her mother , who is Spanish . During her years as a special student at Barnard , Nathalia studied Spanish , and still reads it for fun ; said she could never seem to get very far with French , though . She went to Spain on a student tour , and was fascinated by the bullfights . " I could n't sleep for three nights after my first one , " she said , " arid I could n't wait to see the next . " One of the two modern books she has read is " Death in the Afternoon . " Ernest Hemingway , or somebody in his family , sent it to her when she returned from Spain . We wanted to go further into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent her the hook , but she said she had lost the note that came with it . Just to keep the record straight , the other modern book Nathalia has read is " The Story of San Michele . " Nathalia is violently militaristic and anti-Communistic , an attitude which she probably inherits from her father . He has been in five wars , if you count rebellions as wars ; anyway , three big wars . Nathalia says , with pretty fierceness , what is peace without honor , and if it 's fight they want , let them have it . Mr. Crane 's sight and hearing are failing now , so every day Nathalia meets him at his office and walks home with him . She lives quietly , not bothering much about the theatre or the New York literary set . She told us a rather amazing fact about her literary life : she has never submitted an unsolicited manuscript to an editor . " They write and ask me for something , " she explained .

Did n't say she was n't to write , though , and as a result Nathalia is pretty well ahead . Has an unfinished novel kicking around , a play , lots of verse , and a lecture . The lecture is for a tour which will start when the new book of verse is published . As for the unknown benefactor , Nathalia swears she has n't the slightest idea who it could he . The Cranes used to have hales and bales of newspaper clippings , until Mr. Crane got to worrying about the possibility of fires , and burned them all . He burns Nathalia 's books , too ; the bookcase is right beside the fireplace , and when the fire gets low he tosses in a volume , chosen at random . Nathalia takes it all good-naturedly . She saw us staring at a medieval crossbow hanging on the wall , and told us its story . Seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doorbell rang . Nathalia ran downstairs in her pajamas and opened the door . There , on the doormat , with no sign of where it had come from or who had brought it , was the crossbow . Life has been like that far Nathalia . Last Judgment ALADY and her little daughter were rounding out a holiday afternoon in town by doing some unimportant shopping at a five-and-ten-cent store . Finally they found themselves standing at the tropical-fish counter , looking at five small , quiescent turtles in a glass bowl . The daughter decided she wanted one , and asked a salesgirl the price . " You would n't want any of those turtles , dearie , " the salesgirl said . " They 're all dead . " " You should have kept water in the bowl , " the lady said severely . " No wonder they 're dead . " " They 've been dead for a week , " the salesgirl told her calmly .
