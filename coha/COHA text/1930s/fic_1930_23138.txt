FLEDGLING A STORY BY LIBBIAN BENEDICT T HEY had reached the dessert of stewed prunes in silence , at least as far as conversation was con-cerned . A meal at the Handel home could never be said to have passed in complete silence , although it was usually conversationless . But it is hard to cat quietly when one eats fast , and there was hardly an opportunity for the violation of mealtime quiet which Mr. Handel omitted . He always ate fast because he had left the clerk in the store for the few moments he allowed himself to go home and eat , and he had never yet found a clerk who was trustworthy . These summer days , when business in the grocery lagged , and every cent of profit was doubly important , he could still less permit the clerk long unguarded periods with the cash register . The noonday dinner was the major meal in the Handel home , and Mrs. Handel made a heavy meal of it regardless of the heat and regardless of the fact that her husband 's standstill habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to impede the activities of his short body , even the activity of breathing . She herself was not thin , but she had more bone to bear it and more height . It was only her big face that betrayed the superfluousness of most of her weight . Dolly Lynch , Mr. Handers sister , was the first to speak this noon . Leaning her frizzled henna head in the direction of the young man who sat opposite her , she said : " Well , Albert , have you come around yet to seeing that you really owe your father and mother two more years of your life ? " " Of course he has , " blustered Mr. Handel , breathing with difficulty , as usual . " Of course he has . Any human being could get around to seeing that . And what do you mean by ' two more years of his life , ' Dolly ? Does n't a child owe his whole life to his parents ? " Albert noticed again the uneasiness with which his father argued the subject . And dispassionately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the lack of fineness in his father made the nervousness a far from subtle thing . The man was actually making eyes at his sister to warn her to keep away from the subject . Albert laughed to himself again at the stupidity of his father in thinking that such primitive tactics of suggestion would bring him to change his mind . But even while he was amused at the stupidity he was hurt that his own people should be capable of it , and suddenly for a moment he was doubtful of his own capacities . This was his father , this mentally impotent man . How could he dare to dream his dreams ? " Ed is right , " said his mother . " Why , to hear you talk , Dolly , a person might think that when Albert finally does go away to college he will never come back . You 're really very funny . " Albert was sure that as she passed by her sister-in-law in collecting the dishes his mother had stepped on her foot in another warning to change the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for granted , " he said . " I have n't made a decision of any kind . " Silence followed his words , but as he pushed open the screen door to the front porch he heard the beginning of the daily dialogue . " Let me help you with the dishes , Grace . " " Do n't you dare , Dolly . You 're a visitor . You go right out on the porch and rest . " Of course his mother would win . Or rather , lose . It was she who did want help with the dishes , and Dolly who did not want to offer it . There was none of the genuineness in his mother 's refusal to let the other woman help her that there was in her refusal to let him help her . She all but threw the dishpan at him whenever he made the suggestion . That was the way in which she expressed her admiration for his talent , or ambition , or whatever it was . Well , it would make a good novel eventually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this . There would be the picture of the two , father and mother , idolizing him for what he was able to do yet wanting to keep him tied down to their own lives . As he stretched out on the porch swing and took up his volume of Nietzsche again the humor with which he had been surveying the situation suddenly left him , and he remained with the more familiar feeling of apoplectic revolt . He heard the back door close as his father went out of the house , to take the short cut through the alley to the grocery store . Then the inside of the store was around him  --  grayness , sin ells , and everything , just as it had been all the seventeen years of his life . From the house on the right came the tinkling of a piano that was obviously an experimentation with note sequences . Selina Mack , with a narrow red ribbon tied around her colorless hair , was probably trying to compose another waltz . Good Lord , did she ever hope to finish it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to finish the first one and a goodpart of her savings to have it published . And after all that , she had sold only the copies which she herself had peddled among her neighbors and her pupils . And on the lawn to the left Mrs. Chester was romping with her poodle . Putting pep into herself , probably , before her boarder came home from his post-office job . Would n't that husband of hers ever find out that the two older children were instructed to shout " Mother , may I come in ? " and to wait for a positive answer before they opened the door ? And they wanted him to stay here , to take the first two years of his college life at Junior College  --  here , among these people , when there was a world to see ! Why did n't they make it easier for him ? Why did n't they admit the inevitable , so that when he went away  --  to Chicago , or New York , or Paris , or wherever he would go , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a criminal ? He had buried his head in the musty padding of the swing . The slight creak of the screen door told him that his Aunt Dolly was coming out to entertain him with her lament about the ingratitude of her daughter , about how she had refused to marry again , refused to join bridge clubs as other women did , only in order that her daughter might always have her when she needed her . And now , after all that sacrifice , her daughter had married against her wishes and married , of all people , a poor young lawyer , when she might have had her choice of any of a number of wealthy business men . It was to forget this blow that she had come down from Chicago to Kansas City two weeks ago , at the end of June . She had not made the trip in twenty years , and since his father and mother had not been out of the city either , she had never seen him before . From the moment of her arrival she had subjected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she had become ridiculous in her attempts to find resemblances between him and his parents . " Your mouth is set just like your father 's , " she would say , or , " Your forehead is just like your mother 's . " No one liked her . She had only to open her mouth and remind them of her presence , when the antagonism against her became an almost audible thing . The same antagonism came over Albert now , as soon as she had sat down in the rocking chair beside the swing . He had made a move to get up , so that she could sit down in the swing beside him , but she had motioned him down again . " Oh , no , " she said , " I would n't think of disturbing the young genius in his thoughts . " He did not answer but let his eyes pass hurriedly over her face , in which the wrinkles were filled with fresh pink powder . People were powerless before her , he thought , just as he was powerless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She enslaved , and she did it by poisoning the veins of vanity . One knew the disgrace of his own submission , but there was nothing to do about it . She sat rocking back and forth . Each time he let his glance approach her face , he saw her looking at him , with a smile that struck him as being artificial . It began to disturb him ; he fidgeted . Finally she said : " You do want to go away to college this year , do n't you ? " He sat up . There had been the promise of friendliness in her voice . He knew it would betray him  --  that if he talked to her she would not understand him  --  yet the urge to talk was too strong to resist . " I do . I want terribly to go away . I need it , Aunt Dolly . " She nodded her frizzled red head . " I know , " she said . " I can understand it . " His disbelief grew still weaker . He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things which would sound crazy to his own ears , and certainly to hers . Suddenly she got up from the chair and sat down on the swing beside him , putting her hand on his . " Albert , I want to talk to you . " He noticed that her eyes were a nice shade of gray . But there was fear in them now . And the fear he saw in her eyes stirred fear in him . They continued to look at each other , the fear in each of them rising . " I 've been acting as if I was against your going away , have n't I ? " she said suddenly , talking fast , and hardly waited for him to nod before going on . " Well , I 'm not . I can understand you . You believe that I can , do n't you ? " He nodded again . This time she waited a while before going on , in the meantime rubbing her hand up and down over his . He was never sure , afterward , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words ; it was only the movement of her lips he remembered . " You can go , Albert . They have no right to keep you . They 're not your parents . You 're adopted . " It seemed to him now , and even later , that nothing had happened to him at that moment , yet the woman recoiled , drawing her hand away from his and spreading it out on her breast in self-protection . " They found you outside the store one morning , " she went on , very rapidly . " You were only a week old . " Now he was aware that at some time before this he had stopped the swing , that he was pressing down hard on the porch with his toes , and that they were hurting him . He lifted his feet ; the swing started forward with a jerk . " Who am I ? " he said . " For God 's sake , Albert , do n't talk like that ! " " Who am I ? " he repeated . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody knows . Nobody ever found out . " He found himself standing , then beginning to walk away . " Albert , where are you going ? " He did not turn his head back to the direction from which the wailing question had come . " I do n't know , " he said . " Somewhere . To be alone . " As he walked down the steps and out to the sidewalk he was conscious only of the melodrama of his last words and of a tang of artificiality in them . It made him ashamed ; he wanted to run away . He began to walk fast and soon he was conscious of nothing except the movement of his body as he strode along . When he reached 31st Street he took a street car . He would go out to Swope Park . Rising in him now was a feeling of release and , with it , a desire to laugh . So simple was life ! So ridiculous ! The keys to its secrets were lying all about ; one had only to recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been clever enough to be kind to Aunt Dolly and to listen attentively to her she would never have come to him with this gift of release . Aunt Dolly ? But she was not his aunt . He had no aunt . He had .. . no one . For a moment the world was washed away from around him , and he was riding alone through a nothingness he had tried so often to imagine and never succeeded in doing . But it lasted only for a moment . He was going ! He was free of them ! And suddenly a new cause for joy burst on him . There was no more reason to be doubtful of his capacities . He did not need to be afraid that he was going to he limited by hereditary stupidity . They were stupid . He could think the thought frankly now . Stupid ! And he was not theirs ! A bastard , like the greatest of men . A love child , endowed with divine talents to compensate for the lack of human permission to exist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking leave of the streets the car was passing , almost shouting his farewells as it sped along . He remembered childhood days when he had actually shouted in street cars , glorying that no one heard him . Once hisfather had seen him with his mouth open and slapped him . Even then they had not been able to understand him ; his imaginativeness had been too much for their minds , his gusto for their an= in . But suddenly he remembered how rapidly his father had drawn his hand back to himself after hitting him , how rapidly he had always drawn his hand back . And there had been times when he had started to hit him and had stopped himself . No wonder he had not dared to touch him ! And what would happen when he told them the news ? The scene of the final parting was about to form itself before him , but instead there rushed over him again the solitariness he had been deluged with a while before . The surrounding world disappeared ; he was left with no one and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not until he was out of the car and striding through the tall grasses in the woods . Here , gradually , it began to seem to him that the energy of striding through the grass symbolized the energy with which he was going to stride forward from now on , through less tangible grasses that were just as entangling as these and under which the ground was just as soggy and unknown . It was here that he realized he was still clutching his Nietzsche , and the book , too , became a symbol . By the time he had got off the street car again , near his home , he had resolved to tell them to-night . To tell them simply , without drama , that he knew now he was not their child , he was only adopted . His Aunt Dolly had told him , and he was very grateful to her for it . So , in view of their admission that they had no right to ask him to stay , he was going . He was appreciative , certainly , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their desire to keep it a secret as long as they could . He loved them as much as any son could love his parents , he would come back to stay with them whenever he could ( he would dedicate his first novel to them , but he would not tell them that to-night ) , but he could not stay any longer . That was all . His Aunt Dolly was walking up and down the block when he approached , straining her nearsighted eyes , on which she absolutely refused to put glasses , to see whether he was coming . When he came finally into her range of vision she took the few steps toward him hurriedly , her whole strangely unpowdered face set for speech . But he spoke first . " I had a nice afternoon in Swope Park , " he said , gaily . There was no need to confide his plans to her ; she had finished with her role in his life . He had no more to do with her . " It was quite cool in the woods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could not find anything to say , but trudged beside him up the steps to the porch . She was staring at him , he felt , although he did not turn to look at her . His mother was in the kitchen , mixing salad for supper . " Where did you go off to , son ? " she said . He turned away , besieged with the realization that she called him " son " whenever she could . He imagined , too , very clearly , how her face would look when he broke the news  --  her fat cheeks sagging with incomprehension , her natural slovenliness turned suddenly into the expression of despair . " I went out to Swope Park , " he said , unable to gauge his voice and hoping for the best . " It was nice . " " Hungry ? " " Not yet . " " Take a banana . They 're nice and cold , the way you like them . I 've got them on the ice . " He took one and went out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force it down . His Aunt Dolly was sitting on the swing watching him without let-up , and he made believe he was reading , remembering to turn the pages with definite frequency . All during supper his mother had to keep urging him to eat and , try as he would , he could not swallow half the amount of food he would ordinarily have eaten . " It 's the heat , " said his father , angrily . " You had no right to go out to the park to-day . Wo n't you ever get any sense into your head ? " Albert started to become angry ; he was on the verge of blurting out something . But he caught the beginning of a conspiratory glance from Dolly , and his anger turned against her . After supper , he thought , would be a better time to say what he had to say  --  when they were all sitting on the porch . But Martin Tolman , who had been in his class at high school and who lived down the block , came by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to go out . Thankfully , Albert went . They picked up two girls and drove far out into the country . All through everything Albert felt again , as he had felt that afternoon , that he was taking leave of these things . When he got out of the car he stood for a moment with his hand on the closed door and his eyes to the ground . Verbally he was saying goodnight to Martin , actually he was taking a much more permanent farewell . He did not look up at Martin 's face , because . they never looked at each other after such an evening and never saw each other for a few days afterward . The house was dark . Smiling to himself at the quality of the thing that had made him postpone his plans ( that , too , would make a good point in a novel some day ) , but too tired to conceive , definitely , , exactly what it was all about , he went to bed and fell asleep . He awakened with a jerk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not slept more than an hour . And a moment later he was sitting up in bed , completely wet with a sudden hot sweat . His whole body was burning . " For God 's sake , who am I ? " he shouted and pressed the spread fingers of both his hands slowly backward down FLE D GLING .543 his scalp . " For God 's sake , who a.m I ? " This time he said it more softly , for he had remembered there were people asleep in the other rooms . But the question in him had not grown softer ; it was rising to a greater clamor . He drew his hands down his face , his neck , his body , each finger digging a painful path in his flesh , as if to pull an answer from it . Then it began to seem to him that he was choking ; his hands moved helplessly over the loose collar of his pajamas , trying to clear it still farther from his hot body . " Who am I ? " he was saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from side to side , beating his fists into the pillow each time . " Who am I ? " he said , over and over again . " Who 11111 I ? " More than once he was sure that if he did not get up , rouse the others , make them tell him what they knew , he would go crazy . But he could not lift his body . Eventually dullness came over him . The hall clock struck four . He lay awake , his eyes open , waiting for the gray of dawn . He saw it come , he watched it turn to a sunlit morning , he heard the others up and about and still , for a long time , he lay without stirring because he did not have the strength to raise himself . That day it did not even occur to him to try to say something to his family . From morning until night he was insensate . Most of the day he lay stretched out on the porch swing , still making a pretense of reading because his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleepless night , did not leave him by himself for a moment . Several times he went out for a walk , but could not manage to do more than circle the block . He went to bed early and slept at once . The next morning his awakening brought him , slowly , a clearer realization of what had happened . And as soon as it was clear to him there followed close on it the decision that he would break the strain to-day . He jumped out of bed . He had let two days pass without doing anything . He was a fool . The insensateness of yesterday was unreal to him , he was sure it had been the delusion of his own cowardice . Before the night came he would be on his way . But the night came , and he was not on his way . Every time he looked at his father or his mother the unity of his resolve collapsed , and in its place rose the question " Who am I ? " To-day it was a rhetorical question , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights ago . But it disseminated his ability to talk , nevertheless , and he was quiet . The next day the question began to have meaning again . His throat shouted it over and over from the moment he awakened , even though he made no sound . There was a resumption of his physical suffering , too . He wanted to be alone , because he never knew at what moment he would find himself clawing his own flesh again , with the need to pull some answer from it . He remembered that on the day his aunt had first told him the truth  --  was it only two days ago ? ? he had been exultant with the certainty that his blood was better than that of the people who bad brought him up . To-day he wanted to beat himself for his conceit , and actually , at one moment while he was staring at himself in the mirror , he slapped himself with uncontrolled force . His blood was not better than theirs ; it was worse . He had not inherited genius , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A negro passed , he ran into his room to look into the mirror again , to verify his sudden certainty that there was black blood in him . But the vision of his soft , straight chestnut hair , his hazel eyes , his light skin flung derision back at him , and he crept away , all the more certain that in another moment he would go crazy . ? But there were moments when it all dropped from him and he sank weakly back into the knowledge that all this would stand him in good stead , later , for his work . Vague visions played around him of the glory that would be his , in return for the power he displayed . In all the intermittent times , no matter how far down he had been flung into wretchedness , he never quite lost hold of these moments . On Sunday he awoke with the resolve to go to church , dressed hurriedly , and started out . But when he came to the building and saw the simple beatitude on the faces of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if he entered he would find what he was looking for and knowing , without any doubt , that it would not be the most admirable way of getting it . Then the clerk in his father 's store became ill , and he spent the greater part of two days meting out sugar and beans and coffee . " You 're getting better , " his father said to him . " You 're learning in your old age . I thought you would never be able to pour something from the scale pan into a bag without spilling half of it . " Albert had no desire to answer . Selina Mack , the piano teacher from next door , came into the store . She told him he was not looking well and asked him what was the matter . He was about to answer meaninglessly when the thought suddenly came to him that she was his mother . He could hardly wrap up the loaf of bread she had bought . When she had gone he remembered a hundred moments of gentleness and concern for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had given birth to him in secret somewhere and left him outside the store , knowing that they would probably keep him and that she would have him near to her . To-night , when she was sitting alone on her porch , he would rush up to her and greet her with " Hello , mother ! " Perhaps he would not be a writer , after all , but a composer . As the afternoon passed he became more and more certain that he was right . But as he was hurrying home he remembered that Miss Mack had not moved into the house next door until bewas four years old , and that before that she had lived in Rosedale . He was weak with relief . The hours during which he had imagined that he had the solution now appeared to him in all their unreality . There was comfort in being back where he had started from . Over what swirling secrets human beings could live quietly , socially , he thought , as the days went on . Here again was something he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect made him happy the first time the thought came to him , but gradually he began to know a richer happiness than that which came out of dreaming of his fame . He was becoming aware of new depths in himself , and the awareness alone was what gave him that richer happiness . He did not know whether these depths had existed before or whether they had been created for him by the experience he was going through . He did not care . He knew only that , sleeping in the bed he had always slept in , eating the same kind of food he had always eaten , walking the same streets , he was changing into a different person . There were still moments each day when he asked himself who he was , but the need to have an answer was becoming more dim . Occasionally he tried to force himself to worry about it , but he could not . Somehow , it did not matter . For several days his aunt had showed the signs of sleepless nights and had hounded him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air of untouchability he had established that first afternoon , when he met her walking up and down the block waiting for him . Without any definite gestures , he kept her from starting any discussion of the subject . He even managed , by ways he could not determine , to be seldom alone with her . And gradually her preoccupation with the subject seemed to disappear , too . While it had lasted she had succeeded in overcoming her sister-in-law 's objections to being helped with the housework , and bad done a great deal . Now , however , she lapsed once more . She spent more time in the rocking chair and before her mirror , and had even begun to talk about the ungratefulness of her daughter again . Watching her , Albert marveled still more at the storms over which people could Iive . Not only was it that one person could live over a storm that was his own secret , but a whole group of people could live over a secret that was jointly theirs . What then had his parents been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely some of their neighbors ? A whole structure of life based on a secret , and no signs of it about except his father 's bluster and his mother 's withdrawing tenderness . July ended and half of August passed . Albert watched the days go by . For weeks he had not looked into a book . Three times he had turned down Martin Tolman 's suggestion that they go out . " What 's the matter ? Are you becoming a puritan ? " Martin asked him . The challenge roused Albert , he was tempted to call Martin up and say he had changed his mind ; but like in so many other things these days , he simply could not bring himself , physically , to do it . He had never made many overtures to the girls he had gone to school with , but he had always been gracious toward their overtures . The only reason he had not made many overtures himself was because he always felt the insufficiency of the girls he knew . Too much of him remained asleep when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The little time he did spend with them reassured him as to his desirability and power , and doubts as to these things always arose in him after a considerable period of solitude . Now , though , even his graciousness toward the overtures made by the girls stopped . When they called him he said that his father 's clerk was sick , that he spent entire days in the store , and was terribly tired in the evening . His mother , overhearing his side of the conversation , would comeover to him afterward and half-heartedly urge him to go out more . He would look at her big face and wonder at the perpetual struggle it must be hiding . Once the thought came to him that at last he had the explanation for the incongruity between her big body and the smallness of her voice , particularly when she talked to him . She bad no more strength to give to her voice after she bad ended the combat she must certainly go through each time she made ready to talk to him  --  the combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many times each day he remembered that he must finally decide about going , where to go , what college to plan for , if any . The college end of it was not so definite now ; there would be money matters involved . Each time he tried to hold on to the thought , to mill through it to an answer . And each time it slipped away from him , without his knowing when or how . One evening , late in August , Albert came out on the porch where his father and mother were already sitting . His Aunt Dolly was visiting down the street . There was quiet when he stepped out doors , but he was sure he had heard voices a moment before . Had his coming cut some conversation short ? If so , what had they been talking about ? Had Aunt Dolly told them ? Dizzy with fear that she had , he dropped into a chair facing them both . But already he was asking himself what he was afraid of . Was n't this what he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew ? Bewildered at himself , he kept staring at them until he saw that their essential repose showed that they did not know . " Why did you stop talking so suddenly when I came out ? " he asked , with a playfulness that was giddy with his relief . " What secrets have you got from me ? " " We were n't talking , " said his mother . " We finished , " said his father . Albert chuckled . There was that impotence of theirs again . To contradict each other so unguardedly ! What simple people they were ! " But I heard you mention my name , " he lied . " That 's really not fair . I have a right to know . " He was aware of the cat-and-mouse quality of his manner , and he was enjoying it . It was so easy to play with them . They did not even know he was playing ; no one could reproach him for it . But why . . . why was he wasting his time like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were alone ; the absence of his aunt had helped to create an intimacy for the three of them . Even his teasing was proof of his softness . And more than that  --  it was at moments like this , he felt , that judgments are made and decisions accepted . He felt it because in himself there was no belligerence , no desire to fight for nonexistent standards , and he was sure it was so with them , too . All three of them had been reduced to their unsullied selves as human beings , and there was no limit to their capacity for understanding . This was the moment at which to go over to them , put an arm around each one , and say , " Look here . Aunt Dolly has told me everything about my parentage . Let 's talk about it . " He wanted to do it , he was even sure that if he did not do it now he never would . But he could not bring himself to the physical exertion required . Instead , he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the result of his strange inability to talk out : " Tell me what you were talking about . " There was a moment of silence . Then , wetting her lips first , his mother spoke : " We were wondering when you were going down to Junior College to enroll . " He started out of his relaxed pose so violently that the whole wicker chair creaked . His blood was in his temples . What a fool he had been ! He was the fool and they were the clever ones ! They had waited for his moment of weakness , because they knew that otherwise they did not stand a chance ! They were coercing him ! It was enough ! But his anger did not last . He remembered the smallness of his mother 's voice when she had said her few words . There had been no coercion in it , only pleading . He saw the utter stillness with which his father was awaiting his answer . It was a death sentence they were waiting for , and he could not give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about anything , " he said , weakly . Then he got up and went into the house . Nor was he aware of the moment when he did make a decision . But two mornings later he went downtown to the old high-school building that had been turn d into the Junior College and enrolled . Several times , on his way downtown , he started to get off the street car , to go back . At the door of the college he paused , again resolved to go back . And as he was filling out the application blank , and came to the words " Father 's name " the whole story became tormentingly alive in him once more , with all its mysteries , and questions , and lies . But automatically his fingers had begun to write " Edward Handel " in the blank space , and he watched them go slowly on to the end of their task . Self-accusation and taunting were still in him when he came out of the building . For a moment he stood on the opposite corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could not think of riding back , there was too much nervousness in him . So he started to walk the three miles to his home . But as he walked the nervousness passed away , and in its place came energy  --  exhilarated , exultant . He had nothing to taunt himself with , he saw now . He had wanted to be free and he was free , in a deeper , riper way than he had ever foreseen . Free , with-out hurt anywhere around him , except in himself perhaps , and he was strong enough to stand it . No , even that was not true . He was not hurt . He was not going to play the martyr . There was no denying that what he had now was more than strange cities could ever have taught . His desire to go away had been only a childish hankering after something that had the appearance of life . Now he had life itself . so much of it that it was not yet quiet in him . No , he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even now , as he walked , he continued to look into the face of every man and woman who passed , seeking some resemblance to himself , waiting for some instinctive recognition of his father or his mother . A few days ago his search had been more intense , now he was scanning the faces almost mechanically . But to-morrow , perhaps , some new curiosity would take hold of him . He had gone through so many now that he knew the number was endless . Well , let the torment come . He was ready for it . He looked forward to it . He was even jealous for it . Was this desire for torment a personal idiosyncrasy , he wondered . No , he was certain it was not . What strange creatures we are , he thought , and once more sounded the added depths that had come to him . How narrowly he had missed some tragedy ! Suppose he had blurted out the story a few weeks ago , or even last night ? He would have wrecked them , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life all these years . Not life itself , of course . And yet , what was life to him except what he remembered ? He visualized the scene of his finding : a tiny bit of animate flesh squirming around in a basket outside the grocery store one spring morning seventeen years ago . What connection did he have with that infant ? It was what he had got since then that mattered ; and that they had given to him . But they  --  they were different . He had everything ; but not they . And it was for him to make up for what they did not have  --  the months of waiting for him , the final hours , the first few days of his life . And above all , there was the horror of knowing , always , how far he was from them . All they had was the comfort of his physical nearness . It constituted their illusion of possession , and it was for him to maintain it  --  that was his part in the secret structure . He would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was the warning of tears in his eyes as he strode along . They were tears of thankfulness for whatever it was that had saved him from the tragedy he might have brought about . At the dinner table he told them what he had done , poised for his father 's blustering " So you 've come to your senses at last , have you ? " and his mother 's almost whispered " I knew you would , son . " But neither of them said a word . For the second time that day Albert grew weak and felt tears in his eyes . How little he still knew ! How much beyond him even they still were ! The only sound that had come in answer to his words was a gasp , from his aunt . That evening she announced that she was going home the next day . Over their objections  --  genuinely hearty objections because all three of them were excited and they had no other way of showing it  --  she went into the house , called up the Union Station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older people followed her , first continuing with their pleas , and then , when they saw that it was useless , helping her pack . Albert was left alone on the porch . From the right side came the tinkle of Miss Mack 's piano . He remembered , as of years back , his momentary certainty that she was his mother , and the childishness of it amused him . This was one of the moments when it did not matter at all who his mother was . From the other side came the bark of the Chester ? poodle as Mr. Chester romped with him . Upstairs , Albert knew , the boarder lay asleep . He wondered what was going on in Mr. Chester 's mind , in his wife 's mind , in the boarder 's mind . Then , as the playing of the piano became braver for a few bars , he wondered what Selina Mack was dreaming about as she worked on that second waltz of hers . But this time it was more than wonder ; it was almost a need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dolly and the strange defeat that was driving her back to Chicago and the daughter she had disclaimed . It was defeat that was driving her back . She had lost her child and she had wanted to deprive her brother and his wife of theirs , too . Yes , that was it . It was a clever explanation and a true one . A clever explanation and a true one . . . but it was not enough . It was only the bone ; there was flesh around it , and the flesh was a wall to him . What pain did it endure ? What surges of blood did it know ? What had his aunt gone through this past month ? And his parents  --  what had they gone through these seventeen years ? Would be ever learn these things ? Was the power in him ? The questions wrung him until he was certain that in another moment he would begin to pray for an answer . Then , suddenly , the tension of the last weeks broke altogether , and for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
