In Christ Church Episcopal Cathedral , high on a knoll overlooking Springfield , Mass. , one day last week gathered seven Episcopal bishops , their clergy and many a rich and cultivated worshiper . The grey-haired , 86-year-old retired Bishop of Massachusetts mounted the pulpit , preached on " The Quickening of the Spirit . " Almost abruptly terminating his sermon , the oldster fixed his gaze upon a tall , younger man sitting at a table in the centre aisle . " My son ! " said he , " my father used to say to me again and again , ' No man has ever been blessed throughout life as I have been . ' I have repeated these words for myself , ' No man has ever been blessed throughout life as I have been . ' And of all His blessings , this one stands high , that you are able to take up the refrain into your own life . With the confidence of the people of this diocese , which will , I know , ripen into affection , you will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joyful , grateful service , singing to yourself , ' Bless the Lord , O my soul , and all that is within me , bless His Holy Name . ' " <P> " Old Bishop William Lawrence descended from the pulpit . William Appleton Lawrence , 47 , who had stood up quickly when addressed as " My son , " advanced to the altar . Bishop Lawrence and his six colleagues , including President Bishop James De Wolf Perry , laid their hands upon the bald pate of the man whom the Episcopalians of Western Massachusetts had elected their Bishop ( TIME , Nov. 2 ) . <P> Young Bishop Lawrence was now consecrated , in what his father called " a filial incident which has never before taken place in the history of the church in this country . " Everyone partook of communion .
