THE HOME PLACE : SPRING A STORY BY DOROTHY THOMAS n1-1YLLIS put out her hand to pick up r her comb from the dresser . When her fingers slid over bare wood and left their mark she saw that it was only the outline of the comb where it had lain in the dust . She had forgotten in her sleepiness last night that she had already picked it up and put it on the candy box which held her embroidery threads . Little Betty had gone from her own bed to her parents ' and was sitting astride her father 's chest chanting , " Daddy , you 're a big old rocky hill , with the old dirt all blown away ! What am I ? " " You 're a darn nuisance , " Ralph said fondly , yawned , and set his cheek lightly on the little knee against his face . " You 're not a bear ! " Betty squealed ; " you 're a hill , Daddy ! " Phyllis peered into the little wavy mirror over the dresser and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got two gray hairs . Or maybe it 's just the dust . My hair 's gritty . " Ralph laughed in his throat and held Betty 's pummeling fists away from him . " How is it ? " he asked . " Looks clearer to me ! " Phyllis resolved in her heart not to hold Ralph 's indifference to her first gray hairs against him and moved heavily to the little window . " It 's fine , " she said . " So still . And I can see clear to the cottonwoods . " Little Betty stopped tussling with her father , slid from the bed , and went to the window to see for herself . Phyllis thought her little figure , shadowed under her gown against the window , distressingly thin . She wished so that the child would cat more and be less restless . If only Edna 's boys would leave the child alone ! For a week , because of the dust , the school had been closed and the boys , shut up in the house , had been noisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tagged her grandmother about the place all day and cried if one of the boys pointed a finger at her . Phyllis had decided that when school began again she would keep Betty at home , teach her herself , and give the child a chance to be carefree and happy for at least part of the daylight hours . " Get dressed , Betty , " she said . " It 's almost breakfast time . Your Aunt Edna 's been downstairs a long time . " " Aunt Edna ? " Betty said . " Is Edna my aunt ? I did n't know Edna was my aunt . Is she , Daddy ? " Ralph was sitting on the edge of the bed , putting on his socks . " ' Flaid so , Pet , " he said , and grinned at Phyllis over his child 's head . " We had n't meant to tell you until you were much older , until you had all your second teeth at least , " he said in a deep-down voice that Betty knew at once for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've asked , Edna is your aunt in a way , and Willy is another , and no help for it . " Phyllis smiled , pleased to see him in such a good mood . " Shame on you , Ralph , " she said , and drew Betty to her and fastened the child 's underwaist . " Uncle Tom married Aunt Edna , and Uncle Harvey married Willa , and so they 're your aunts , " she explained . Betty , who until that moment had thought that marriages came only to princesses and princes and never certainly to one 's own uncles , nodded gravely . Ralph kimboed his arms and sang in his deepest bass , " And they all lived together in a little crooked house . " When they had gone downstairs , Betty on Ralph 's shoulder , Phyllis went slowly about the room , putting it to rights . She made up her bed and Ralph 's and the little box-on-twochairs bed that was Betty 's . There was a homey gaiety about the room once it was in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red-and-white quilts she and her mother-in-law had hung for curtains to shut off the storeroom part , the red-dotted , thin Swiss curtains at the window that had once been the voluminous skirt of her mother-in-law 's Sunday summer dress , and the blueand-white quilt on the big bed gave the unfinished low-raftered room color and life . And it was their own , hers and Ralph 's and Betty 's , away from the rest of the house and the Young family . Here Ralph was more himself than he ever was downstairs , and here Betty , away from her cousins ' rough teasing , laughed and played and was a different child . After she had dusted the window ledge and the dresser and little rocking chair Phyllis sat on the edge of her bed resting . Breathing was very hard for her . She wondered how much easier it would be without thedust . She remembered that the last weeks before Betty 's birth had been long and trying ones . But there was no comparison between that time and the present . That had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as she could see from her window , and the mornings sweet with lark song . She would wake in the big maple bed to hear Olga , her noisy , big-hearted hired girl , moving about the house . Ralph would come in from the morning chores , smelling of the stable , hang his hat on the bedpost , give it a whirl and say , " How are you , Baby ? Do n't get up unless you feel like it . " Ralph had begun to call her Baby in fun during the months of their engagement , and the name had rooted . How she had been cherished ! Below stairs the life of the house was in noisy motion . Edna was doubtless getting breakfast with Mama Young 's help . Already , Mama Young 's voice was raised breathily in a hymn : " Peace , peace , sweet peace ; wonderful gift from Above . . . . " Old Granma Young would be sitting up in her bed in the kitchen corner , having her say about the weather , assuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust storms in the old days when they lived in the sod house , and that the grasshoppers were " a good sight worse " anyway , grumbling a little at not finding herself in the room that had been hers for almost half her long life . Willa would still be sleeping in Old Gran-ma 's room , and the kitchen would be free of menfolk . Edna 's three boys were in the house ; their shouting and scuffling came up faintly . Phyllis heard slow , heavy steps on the stairs , and knew her mother-in-law was coming up to see how she was . " Hoohoo , " the old woman said at the door and came in with her rolling , comfortable walk . " Well , how do you feel ? " she asked and sat down by Phyllis and laid a plump warm hand on her knee . " Little better , with the wind down , is n't it ? " " Much , " Phyllis said . " Is breakfast ready ? " " Almost . The menfolks are just corning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel up to it . I 'll fix a plate for you and send you up some coffee . " " I 'll go down , " Phyllis said . " It spoils Edna 's day if I do n't come down . " She laughed and sat gasping after her laugh . " Well , never mind her , " Granma Young said . " She 's got Willy to fret about now . I must say , myself , I do n't know how Willy sleeps so late . How do you suppose she ever managed when she had to get up and go to an office of a morning ? It was ten when she got to the kitchen yesterday morning , and she was n't dressed then . I wish you 'd seen Edna . She did n't say anything , did n't even look at her ; but myl And Edna 's washing this morning . I put your wash in with the rest . And it 's a wash , I tell you . Over two weeks  --  now if the wind 'll only stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes is on now . Willa ' 11 have to do her own wash by hand , I guess . I went in and got Harvey 's shirts and under-things , and she never woke . My , the good shirts that boy has  --  enough to do all our boys for Sunday for years , and they 're wearing out so fast , wearing them in the field . Next time we 've any cash on hand I 'm going to buy up a whole bolt of shirting and make a lot of shirts . My , the shirts I used to make when the three boys were all home , and the washings we 'd have . Sometimes three lines full and the yard fence too with just the men 's clothes . And still I wished I had a girl to sew for . " " Let 's go down , " Phyllis said , and they went down together , Mama Young a step ahead , turning to put up a steadying hand , saying , " Take it easy on these stairs . 1 declare I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me and built in such steep old stairs . I guess then he thought we 'd never be using the upstairs much . Oh dear ! " Granma Young finished most of her recollections of other years with a tender , forgiving " Oh dear ! " " It 's funny , " Phyllis said , " how you always feel without thinking that when you go downstairs , or when you go up , if you 're down , that the air will be easier to breathe there . " " Well , the kitchen 's full of steam from the washing and if that not easier to breathe it 's different anyway . " In the kitchen Phyllis went at once to her husband 's old grandmother and sat down on the bed beside her . It was best to get the old woman 's warnings and omens about the weather and the family health out of the way first thing . Old Granma , confused as she was about almost everything , always remembered that Phyllis was the one of her grandsons ' wives that was soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of advice , dipping back into her memory , bringing up scraps of - woman- wisdom from even before her own time . " There 's a herb , " she told Phyllis quaveringly , " grows down beyond the mill . I 've heard my Aunt Kate speak of it . You take a path , she says , and go down beyond the oaks , and there ' t is  --  a round-leafed plant . Boil it and drink the water off it . Keeps the feet and ankles from swelling . In Indiana , the folks ' place in Indiana , you go down beyond the mill . You take a path .. . " Old Granma lost herself , along the path hack in Indiana , and slowly let go Phyllis 's hands , shut her eyes , and swallowed loudly in her corded throat . The menfolk were washing and combing , getting ready for breakfast . " Mighty fine day , " Grandpa Young was saying loudly , so that his old mother , who loved weather as she loved her life , might hear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month . Pity it 's not a school day , Betty . Think they 'd have school , clear as it is , if it was n't Saturday . " Edna was filling oatmeal bowls with thick oatmeal , and little Betty , pleased and important , was carrying them to the table for her , saying " There ! " as she put down each bowl , just as her grandmother said " There . " Grandpa saw and winked at Ralph , pleased as he always was with Betty 's ways . He moved to his place at the head of the long table , sat down , and looked round on his sons and his sons ' wives , and his grandchildren . " All here , Mama ? " he asked . " Looks like we can work to-day , boys . A fine day . " He bowed his head and said the blessing . Edna got up as soon as he had finished and brought the coffee . Only Willa 's place was vacant . Mama Young had insisted , despite her protests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had two dizzy spells the day before . The old lady ate noisily , wanting them at the table not to forget her . " Who 's missing ? " Granpa Young asked innocently , noticing Willa 's unturned plate . " Somebody sick ? " " Who do you suppose ? " Edna said . The older boys , Tom and Ralph , knew well that Grandpa had not thought of making trouble , that he was as free from guile as a man could be ; but Harvey , who was less used to his father 's ways since his return , felt reproached and got up and said , " I 'll fetch her , " and went into the dining room and on to Old Granma 's room to wake his wife . " Now here , " Grandpa called , " that 's all right . Never mind , Son . " He puckered his mouth to whistle , as he always did when he was embarrassed , and then remembered he was at the table and took a long whistling drink of coffee instead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced cheerfully , " and so is Willa ! " Her cousins laughed loudly , and little George said , " Aw , you crazy , did n't you know that ? " Willa came in with Harvey , her yellow hair in a knot on the back of her head , washed , and came to the table . She wrapped her pajama jacket tightly about her , hunched her shoulders , and said , " No , thanks , " shortly when her father-in-law passed her the cream pitcher , and pushed the oatmeal bowl from her with the palm of her hand . She sipped her coffee slowly and spoke to no one . Grandpa outlined the work for the day , finishing with a kind , " If that suits you , boys . " He was happy that a day had come fit for work . Phyllis thought he was disappointed that his sons were so silent and unresponsive . Tommy , Edna 's oldest boy , shouted for more oatmeal , and Edna reached across the table and handed him Willa 's bowl . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good enough for some people . " Willa put up her thin red-nailed hands and pressed the pins tighter in the knot of her hair . " I said I was n't hungry , " she said . " I ca n't eat when I 'm dragged out this early in the morning . I 've told you I do n't want breakfast . " She set her teeth on her underlip and looked across the table at Tom , a wide-eyed , direct hurt look . Tom looked down quickly and said , " Bread , please , mama , " and did not look up again . Willa pushed her chair back from the table , wound her bare feet in mules about the legs , breathed on her nails , and rubbed them on the worn brocaded lapel of her pajama jacket . Phyllis and her mother-in-law exchanged one of their brief communing glances . Harvey saw it , and said , " Willa , for Pete 's sake , do you have to do your nails at the table ? " " Why , I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . " I was just looking at them . My God , I ca n't do a thing , you do n't bark at me . The whole bunch of you ! You think just because ? " " Oh , keep still , " Harvey said . " Go get some clothes on and quit this ' poor-little-me ' ! " Tom looked up at Harvey , opened his mouth to speak , decided against it , and reached out and clamped a hand on his youngest son 's shoulder and said , " What 's your hurry ? You do n't need to take bites like that , do you ? " Willa got up from her place and said , " I did n't do a thing ! You come in and drag me out here before I can fix my hair even , and then jump on me ' cause I 'm not dressed . Whatta you want ? I ca n't do a thing you are n't all over me ! " Her voice had risen to a scream . Old Granma in her bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this woman ? What 's she doing here ? " Ralph , who had a way with his old grandmother , went to her and explained gently , " That 's Harve , Gran-ma , not George . That 's Harve 's wife . " " Oh , " the old lady said , " that 's right . I forgot . Come here , child , " and held out her hand . Willa went to her and sat down on the edge of the bed , fumbled in her jacket pocket for a cigarette , lighted it , and flipped the match toward the cob box . Harvey looked round on his family , ashamed as he always was for smoking . When they first came home he had forbidden her to smoke after he saw the horror in his mother 's face , but Willa had cried and been unmanageably bitter . " Are you crazy ? " she had wailed . " Just because we 've got to live off here in the sticks with this outfit , do we have to art like ' em ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter-in-law , " my Aunt Kate smoked a pipe and she lived to ninety-four . I can stand that a lot better'n I can the way she fixes up . I neverthought George 'd go off up there and bring home a heathen woman . " A whole winter 's association with Harvey and Willa had not convinced Old Granma that Harvey was not her youngest son , George , who had gone to the Klondyke and had been " good as dead " for thirty years . Old Granma took Willa 's hand in hers , looked at the red nails , and said , " Were n't there any missionaries up there , George ? Could n't you learn her something yourself ? " " Precious little , " Harvey said loudly . Willa jerked her hand from Old Granma 's and ran into her room . Harvey took his hat and followed his brother Tom from the kitchen . Phyllis went to the door with Ralph . He kissed her and said , " Get outside , Baby , why do n't you ? While it 's nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " come with me , Phyllis . I 'm going to set out plants until Edna has the clothes ready to hang out . A day like this puts some hope in a body . " " Is it going to rain ? " Betty cried . " Is it , Granpa ? " " Bless you , it do n't look it , " Granpa said and put his hand on her curls . " But it 's still and clear and sunny . It 's the best day we 've had . " When the menfolks and the little boys had gone Phyllis gathered up the dishes . " I 'll do them , " she told Edna ; " you go on with your washing . No telling how long it 'll stay clear like this . " Edna gave her short snort of a laugh . " Better keep off your feet , " she said . " Leave the dishes till I get the wash out . I 'll do them then . " " No , I 'll wash them , " Phyllis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to her washing machine . Phyllis felt that her mother-in-law was right , that Edna 's hatred for Willa had pretty well crowded out her grudge toward Phyllis . When Edna stopped her washing , dried her hands , and took the heavy platter from Phyllis to set it up on the high pantry shelf , Phyllis felt something near to kindness in her " Here , let me do that ! " When she had finished with the dishes , Phyllis decided to sew a while and went to Old Granma 's room , that had been hers and Ralph 's room when they first came to the Home Place , to get some pillow-slips from a trunk that was still there . She thought she might make the pillow-slips over into baby clothes , into a dress and underskirt to match , for the new baby . When she rapped at the door Willa said , " Who is it ? " and then , " Come in . " Willa was lying on the unmade bed . " I 'm sorry to bother you , " Phyllis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but I want some things from my trunk . " " Okay , go ahead , " Willa said . Phyllis opened up her trunk and began laying piles of towels and pillowcases on the old sofa . " You sure have stuff enough , " Willa observed . " You did n't make it all yourself , did you ? " " Most of it , " Phyllis said . " The girls in my building gave me a shower too . I was teaching then , you know . " " Yes , Harvey said you were a school teacher . I do n't see how you could do it . I 'd never have the patience , myself . Kids drive me nuts . " Phyllis said nothing . " Most of them do , " Willa said . " Yours is cute . But those boys ! Are n't they just the meanest , orneriest little devils you ever saw ? " " Yes ! " Phyllis said from a pent-up heart . " Yes , they are . " " It 's not Tom 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all right , Tom is . But what can he do ? It 's hers ! " Phyllis was silent . To concur in Willa 's opinion of Edna 's boys was one thing . To touch on the very sore subject of Edna 's behavior was another . Willa was looking at her keenly , eagerly . " There 's little any of us can do , " Phyllis said . " We 're here . We 've lost our homes . The folks are doing their best to make us at home here . We 'll just have to wait and ? " she recognized her voice as her old school-teaching one , and stopped . " And what ? " Willa shrilled. " ' es not so bad for you . They like you ; they all carry you round on a chip , and Ralph 's swell to you . What would you do if he ever lit into you the way Harve lights into me every time I open my mouth , when I 'm not doing a thing ? He 's jealous . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's treated me decent . The whole bunch of them are down on me . Are we all just gon na stay on here ? Why do n't they get out ? Why do n't they do something ! " " Maybe we can get out , maybe we can find something a little later , " Phyllis said , her voice trembling . " But you see , Tom and Ralph are farmers . They had their own places . They want to farm again . " She spread out her hands . " When things are better , when it rains  --  when this clears up  --  here the land is n't spoiled like it is out west . When it rains .. . " " What , when it rains ? " Willa cried . " We 'll still be here . Can a little old place like this keep a dozen people ? Why do n't Harve get out and find something ? I tell you what , he 's not trying . He thinks if he stays here he 'll break me , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , dear ! " Phyllis said , like her mother-in-law . " Well , maybe I will . He 's asking for it . Let him take what he gets . " " He 's asked for what ? " Phyllis said . " He 'll see , " Willa said , and selected the longest of the cigarette-ends in the saucer on the chair by the bed and put it into her holder . Phyllis put the pillow-cases back in the trunk  --  she had decided she could not sew that morning . She went out to where her mother-in-law and little Betty were setting out pansy plants beside the house . " My goodness , child , you 're white ! " Mama Young said . " What you been doing ? " with Willa , " Phyllis " Talking said . She could indeed see " clear to the cottonwoods . " The sun , that for so many days had been what Old Granma called " end-of-the-world red , " was a paler color . " I think I 'll go for a walk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cottonwoods . " " Oh , do you think you ought to ? " Mama Young said , straightening up with a hand on her back . " That 's quite a piece . You better take Betty with you . " But Betty did n't want to go . To be setting out plants with her grandmother was a lot more fun than walking to the cottonwoods with her mother . Phyllis did not urge her . She really wanted to go alone . Inside the fence she walked slowly in the brittle grass , watching the little puffs of dust that rose with each step . It was spring , but the earth and the young grass and the air smelled not of life but of death . If she could do without breathing it would not be half so bad ; but to be conscious , painfully conscious , of each breath was trying , saddening . When she came to the top of the gently rolling hill she could look down on the dry drifted creek bed and see the hollowed place where the sod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Indiana . The great cottonwoods were of Young planting . She came to the first of the trees and rested , standing panting , with her back against it . She went on to the biggest tree , sat down with her back against it , and looked upinto the maze of its little dusty , gray-green leaves . From where she sat she could see the Young home place , with the little figures of Mama Young and Betty moving between the well and the flower garden . Across the road from the Young place , the big square house Tom had built for Edna stood up against the roiled sky . Phyllis disliked the house with a shamed , rebellious dislike . It was ugly , stolid , like Edna . It stood for Tom 's and Edna 's unjust feeling that Ralph and she , because Tom and his father had helped Ralph buy land and farm machinery that had had to go , were to blame more than anyone or anything else for the anxious poverty they all lived in now . The little old Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porches and gateways . Mama Young 's seal was on it . It looked peaceful , clean , and good . There were only two people in it , as she looked on , Phyllis reminded herself  --  two unloved , bitter women . One was working in a steamy kitchen , the other was lying on her bed in a disordered room or standing before Old Granma 's speckled mirror , coaxing a wave into her yellow hair or thinning her brows with a pair of tweezers . Maybe Willa would make her threat good . Maybe she would " do something . " Maybe she would go away . A car stopped on the highway and a woman leaned out to shout , " Anything wrong ? " It was strange no doubt to see a woman sitting under the cottonwoods alone in the forenoon . " No . Thank you . No , " Phyllis shouted back , her hands cupped around her mouth . The car moved on . Phyllis got up and began gathering tumbleweeds from along the fence , to pile them together and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeds together with sticks she picked up and a couple of dried corn-stalks . Her bower hid her from the road and left the field and house in clear view . She took off her sweater , rolled it to use for a pillow , and lay down . Lying there , the land seemed wider , kinder . She went to sleep , and an ant , crawling on her arm , woke her . Below her in the field a little whirlwind played by itself . Down near the dry creek bed she saw something moving and , as they came nearer , she made out a pheasant cock and three hens going their slow and rhythmic way . They were not shining , superb , as pheasants ought to be . They were dull , bedraggled , and scrawny . The sight of them made her sadder than anything she had known during the winter . She had thought herself immune to any but duller sorrows , but the ruined pheasants made her cry with sudden , hurting sobs . When she looked again the birds were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . She went to sleep and slept fitfully , dimly conscious of the rough ground under her and of the ant that had come to travel along her arm again . The wind woke her with its strong smell of powdered furrows . She got to her feet and leaned against the tree a minute , looking toward the house . There a little Edna was scurrying along , taking in her clothes from the line . The whipping bit of pink would be her own apron . Dust rose in whirls from the field and hid the house . She saw that she had better start for home . If a bad wind came she might lose her way and they would be anxious about her . She kept close to the fence as she went , took off her sweater and put it over her head and walked as fast as she could . She had watched so many dust storms , from the little window in the ell room , from the kitchen downstairs , but she had never been out in one for longer than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was excited and frightened . The wind came in only infrequent gusts and the going was unpleasant , but nothing worse . But the hurrying was too much for her . She stopped and rested against a fence post . Her sweater sleeve caught on a barb of the fence wire and she struggled with it to get it loose , her eyes almost shut against the sifting cloud , when she heard someone calling her name and saw one of the men running up the slope toward her . It was not Ralph but Tom . " Hi , there , " he panted . " Mama 's scared stiff about you . How far 'd you go ? " She tried to answer him and found that she had n't the breath for it . " I do n't think it 's going to blow bad , " he said . " It 's no storm , just a little wind . You take it easy . If it blows hard , I 'll carry you . " She took his arm and hurried along beside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stopped for breath whenever she felt she could go no farther without resting . Ralph came to meet them when they were resting a moment on the last rise , and scolded with loving anger . " Good Lord , Baby , why 'd you go so far ? I did n't know you 'd gone . Came in ? put up my team  --  did n't know till I got to the house . . . " He had been running and was out of breath . Before she could answer him Tom had gone on , leaving Ralph to look after her . When they reached the yard gate Grandpa was there to open it and add his word of concern . Mama Young , with Betty clinging to her apron , was on the step to meet them . Old Granma was out of her bed , insisting loudly that they should send for the doctor , that Phyllis would be sure to have her baby " right away , " and Edna said , " Well , she 's here and she seems all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone cold ? " Mama Young insisted that Phyllis should go to bed and rest . Ralph went upstairs with her , and his mother came up almost at once with a large pan of warm water , soap , and a towel . " Go on down , Son , and get your dinner , " she said to Ralph . " I 'll see to Phyllis . " Mama Young knelt and took off Phyllis 's shoes and stockings , talking soothingly all the while . In bed , after her bath and a bowl of hot potato soup , Phyllis fell asleep almost at once , with her mother-in-law 's voice droning on gently . She was dreaming that she was in her father 's house , and that he had just come home from his office at the bank and was saying , " Got something for my girl . Guess what ? " and that he had taken from under his coat one of her embroidered pillow-slips and handed it to her like a sack . Inside the sack she had felt the little body of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , " she thought , " with no fuss , no pain , no worry . " Her father had seen to everything in his quiet kindly way . Someone was knocking , and she ran to the door and peeked out to see if it might be Ralph , and sure enough it was Ralph . " Ralph , " she called , eager to tell him that the baby had come with no bother to anyone  --  and woke to hear Harvey saying , " It 's Harve . May I come in ? " She sat up in bed and drew the quilt up under her chin . " Come in , " she said . " Is it night already ? " Harvey sat down in the little rocker . " No , just getting a little thicker , " he said . " Sure is dark up here . Shall I light the lamp ? " " Please do , " Phyllis said . " There on the dresser . " When the lamp was lighted , Harvey looked about the room and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've certainly worked this place over . Best-looking room in the house . " " Thanks , " Phyllis said . " It 's your mother 's quilts make it so cozy . I think when I have a house again , I 'll hang quilts for curtains all over the place . " " Is all the junk that used to be stored up here behind those red-and-white ones ? " Harvey asked . " Care if I look ? " She listened to his rummaging about while the lamp he carried threw his shadow on the rafters . He came back presently , set the lamp down on the floor , and said , " Will you look at this now ! My knife . Tom gave me this knife . Must have been when I was eight or ten . Tom 's quite a bit older than Ralph and me , you know ; couple of boys between him and Ralph that died when they were little . " He opened the blades and Iaid the knife in his palm , blades up , and held it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good knife , " he said , turning it back in the lamplight . " Boy ! I remember when I lost it and hunted everywhere for it . I got down and roiled over the whole yard  --  when you lose a knife in the grass the only way to find it is to roll for it . I remember I used to lie in bed and try to remember where I had it last . That old train that goes by around nine used to have the longest , saddest old wail of a whistle ; well , it used to say one thing to me  --  I 'd hear it over under the bluffs by the river ? ' I lo-o-o-st it right along h-e-e-re somewhere . . . ' Mama must have found it some place and put it away for me up here . " He sat down on the floor and began to play mumblety-peg with the knife . He sighed . " Yes , sir , " he said , " Tom gave me this knife . Never thought then I 'd be stalking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did I ? " " What ? " Phyllis said . That Tom watched Willa , knew always when she came into the room and where she was in the room and what she was doing , and that Willa showed off for Tom , pouting and looking lonely and lost and abused , Phyllis knew well enough , and all the others knew ; but nothing had ever been said about it . " Right , " Harvey said . " Willy said she was going upstairs to look out the south window and see if it was clearing up any , and almost right away Tom says he 's going up after his watch . So ? up I go . They 've just gone down . I 've been doing that sort of trailing the best part of the winter , in a quiet brotherly way . Do n't know why I bother . " Phyllis looked at him . The lamp lighted his face clearly . There was nothing in his expression to suggest any deeper concern than his words suggested . " I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come of it ? No , I suppose not . He 'll just go on mooning and pulling his long face and being the devil to get on with when we 're out working . No sired We were fearfully and wonderfully brought up , we Young boys . I ca n't see any of us going in for adultery . " He tossed the knife farther than he had tossed it before and left , it standing in the board until it stopped quivering before he reached for it . " Oh Lord , " he said , " what I 'd like would be some golf . That 's one thing . I 've still got my sticks . I left ' ent out there and never went hack after ' em . Guess I could send for ' em . We could lay out a few holes along the creek . Met my best girl , playing golf . " " I would n't think of Willa playing , " Phyllis said , sure that Harvey was not speaking of Willa . " Willy ? I guess not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doris . I used to go out to her brother 's place to play . She came to visit . I was out there a lot . About every week-end . " " What happened ? " " Nothing . I could n't have bought her shoes . " " Hcr shoes likely did n't mean a lot to her . You should have asked her anyway . " " Maybe . I did n't think so at the time . She was married last fall . A real nice wedding . Took up a whole page in the Tribune . " " And so you married Willa ? " Phyllis said . " Well , not just ' and so . ' Willy and I worked in the same place . You see she took most of my dictation when I was in the office . I saw her a lot ; she was up at my place a lot . She got mad about the time I met Doris . She had a chance to get another job . It was n't as good salary but it was easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than the one she had . Well , she 'd been mad and she came and asked me if I thought she ought to change  --  take this other job . I thought maybe she wanted to get out because we 'd not been getting on very well , see , and I thought we could get on all right , and I did n't want her changing on my account , and I said I thought she ought to stay on . She 'd been there longer than I had . I thought we could get on all right . Well , when this outfit went under we were both out of a job . I had my rent paid ahead , another month , on my apartment , and I was pretty sure I could get something to do  --  this was just before Doris was married . Willy was pretty low . She owed some money for clothes and was behind with her rent . " He sighed again . " About a third of her stuff was over at my place anyway . We got married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of her wedding . He was a junior in the University then . Her bridesmaids had been terribly awed at his good looks , his apparent sophistication , and his football record . Remembering her wedding , and looking at Harvey 's face as he remembered his , brought tears to her eyes . " Will you hand me a handkerchief from the little blue box in the top dresser drawer , Harvey ? " she asked . " Right , " he said . " I hope you did n't find my talc distressing . I 'm pretty used to it myself . " He lifted the lamp to the dresser and opened the drawer . " Say , who 's this ? " he asked and took a picture from the drawer . " Oh , that 's an old sweetheart of Tom 's . Your mother found it , when she was sorting the things in this room before I moved in . Is n't she pretty ? I saved the picture out , put it in my drawer . I like to think of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , I can remember her . She was mighty pretty . Mama thought Tom would never get over it when she died . . . that was during the War . " " Do you think , " Phyllis asked cautiously , " that she looks anything like Willa ? " Harvey considered , holding the picture at arm 's length . " No , I would n't say so . She was light and small . That 's all the resemblance I 'd see . " He gave the handkerchief to Phyllis and saw the tears on her lashes . " Aw , say , " he said , alarmed , " do n't you think about that stuff . I 'll get on with Willa now for as long as she 'll get on with me . I 'm not worried about it . And Tom  --  he 's pretty much married himself ; and Edna will take care of herself  --  here , I 'll read you something . " He got down to look at the books in the little case under the window , selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeve . " Here , " he said , " I 'll read you some poetry . " He sat in the little rocker and rocked while he hunted for a poem he thought would cheer and please her . Phyllis watched him and listened to the wind . Outside , with the added darkness of dust , the air was a heavy , ugly brown . The floor , the window ledge , the quilt under her hands were coatedwith dust . Her palms were gritty . The rain has taught us nothing at all . Harvey was reading in his slow , deep voice . She thought to herself the dust had taught her something in the beginning , but it had stayed too long , dinged its lesson over and over , every day , almost every hour , until it meant nothing at all but a kind of angry , hopeless inanity . The hawk that motionless above the hill In the pure sky Stands like a blackened planet , She thought of the pheasants in the field and how she had cried for them .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing at all . In the shadow of the hawk we feather our nests . " We feather our nests , " she repeated after Harvey ; " that 's what we do , is n't it ? " and recognized , in spite of her feeling , the teacherliness in her voice . Harvey closed the book with a finger at the place . " Yes . Well , " he said , " I guess you do . But you 're the only one . Think Tom or I 'd get a lot of kick out of nesting , hawks or no hawks ? " " There 's your mother , " Phyllis said . " Yes , there 's Mother and Dad . They 've got on . " " Finish it , " Phyllis said . " Yes , " Harvey said , but did not begin at once ; he rocked , looking at the black window , the book hung in his huge hands between his knees . Someone came upstairs . It was Ralph with little Betty hung across his shoulder like a meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hello , " Ralph said and set his daughter down on his brother 's knee . " Did n't know you were up here , Harve . " " He 's been reading to me , " Phyllis said . Little Betty took the book and read silently to herself , spelling the words with her lips . " Mama wants to know if you want your supper sent up or if you feel like coming down , " Ralph said . " I 'll go down , " Phyllis said , " but , oh , I dread those stairs ! Did you boys fall down them when you were little ? " " Constantly , " Harvey said , " or as often as we got past Mama and got the stair door open . " Phyllis said she thought she ought to dress , but Ralph said , " No , do n't bother . Supper is ready . Come Iike you are . Here 's your robe . " He knelt and held her slippers for her then picked her up in his arms . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and you run ahead and open doors , Betty . " " Oh , Ralph ; down those steep stairs ! " " Afraid ? " " A little . Let me down ! " " Nope . Go on , Harve . If I drop you , Harve here will pass me the lamp , catch you , and you 'll never know what happened . " Betty ran ahead and cried for everyone to come and " see Daddy carry Mother downstairs . " Over the lamp , over Harve 's head , Phyllis looked down into the steamy kitchen . The room was hung with indoor clotheslines , heavy with shirts , house dresses , and overalls ; for the dust had come before the colored clothes were hung out . It was like looking down into a tropical forest where all the trees and vines were denim blue . From near the stove Edna looked up at her , a dish of steaming food in her hands . Her heavy face was homely with sweat and fatigue . Edna 's boys shouted excitedly to see Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew out . Phyllis 's chair for her . " You 'd think there was a fire , " Edna said wearily . Old Granma said she felt lots better and that if they made her stay in bed any longer she 'd rot , that she was going to get up . Ralph folded a quilt from her bed and hung it over her chair for her . " Here you are , Granma , " he yelled in her better ear . " Here 's your chair fixed for you , " and helped her up and led her to the table . " Well , that 's fine , " Grandpa said . " Nice to have everyone up to the table , " He looked round and saw that Willa was missing and began his breathy embarrassed whistle . Harvey went to the dining room door and called Willa , but she did not answer . " Everything 's going to be cold again , " Edna said . " Ca n't you keep from harping on that ? " Tom said hotly . " The wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , the rest of us manage to get here , " Edna said . " Looks like when she never lifts a hand to get a meal ? " Mama Young saw that trouble was dangerously near . " Edna 's tired , " she said , " and it 's discouraging to get a meal and have to see it get cold . " She smiled appealingly on her sons . " You bet I 'm tired , " Edna said , looking hard at Tom . " If you 'd done a two-weeks ' wash for thirteen people , and half of it so dusty it 's got to be done over again , you 'd be tired too . " " Did your sleep rest you good ? " Mama Young asked Phyllis . Edna looked angrily at Phyllis . " My Lord , " she cried , her heavy voice trembling with weariness , " you 'd think nobody 'd ever had a baby before ! " She got up from her chair and went to the stove and yanked open the oven door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow his head and ask the blessing . As soon as the " Amen " was said , Mama Young got up from the table and went to Edna . " Why , Edna , " she asked in a gentle , scared whisper , " you are n't , you are n't ? that way , are you ? " " No , " Edna said loudly , " and a lot of difference it would make if I wasl Ca n't you see me carried to the table in a bathrobe if I was ? " She laughed shortly , her ugly snorting laugh , and slid a pan of biscuits onto a plate . Harvey came back from the dining room and went to his mother . " Mama , " he said , " do you know where Willa is ? She 's not in there . " " Why , I do n't know , Son ; she must be around somewhere . She . . . " Tom got up from his chair . " She 's gone , " he said . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Grandpa Young said ; " what 'd you say , Tom ? " " She went to town with Fergusons , " Tom said again loudly . " She 's going in to Omaha on the train to-night . How long do you think she was going to stand it , like it was here ? " He looked angrily at them all , his lower lip thrust out . " And where , " Edna asked , " did she get the money to go to Omaha ? " " I gave it to her , " Tom said . " You would ! " Edna cried . " You 'd take cream money , money we needed for shoes for the boys , for everything .. . " Extreme tiredness had loosened Edna 's tongue as anger and bitterness alone never had . " Here ! " Grandpa Young said sternly and brought his knife handle down on the table . " What 's going on here ? You mean Harvey 's wife 's gone away ? What about it , Harvey ? " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know anything about it . Maybe she got a job . " " No , " Tom said . " Guy Ferguson was by here this morning and he said he was going in to meet the train tonight because his wife 's mother 's coming , and I told Willa , and she said she 'd go in with him . She means toget a job in Omaha . She 'll stay there till she does . " " Well , " Grandpa said , " I guess none of our womenfolks need to go out job hunting . I guess we still have a roof . Mama , did you know anything about this ? " " No , Arch , no I did n't , " Mama Young said . " I knew she was restless . But I did n't know she was planning to go away . " " How much did you give her ? " Edna asked . Tom did not answer . " I heard the front door close a while ago , " Mama Young said , " but I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . " " When 'd she go ? " Harvey asked . " I do n't know , " Tom said . " She did n't say . I did n't know she had gone . " " Did Guy say he 'd come by for her here ? " Grandpa asked . " No , she was going down to the road to wait for him . He did n't know she 's going . " " Then maybe she 's not gone yet , " Grandpa said . " Maybe she 's down at the drive yet . Better go down , Harvey , had n't you ? Pretty mean night to be out in . " Harvey moved toward the door . Old Granma put out her hands and caught at his sleeve . " What 's going on ? What 's going on here ? " she said shrilly . " George , who is it 's gone ? Is it your woman ? Well , Son , you listen to me . Let'r go . Just let'r go . If it 's her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody 's blaming you . Son , let'r go ! " The kitchen door opened , letting in a gust of dusty wind , and Willa . She slammed the door and leaned against it , coughing . " Why , there she is now ! " Old Granma piped . " Oh , well . " " What do you think you 're up to ? " Harvey asked loudly . Willa shook her yellow head and stood coughing . Mama Young went to the sink , filled the wash pan with warm water from the reservoir , and said , " Well , it 's an awfully bad night to go to town anyway . Come have your supper , come wash and have your supper . " Willa pushed her suitcase to one side with her foot . She looked at Tom . " You told them , " she cried . " What 'd you do that for ? You let me go out and wait alone in that dirty cold wind an hour , and nobody coming . . " Tom looked at her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We did n't any of us know you 'd gone , " Mama Young said . " If we 'd known , and you 'd still been determined to go , Harvey 'd gone down , waited with you . " There was reproach under her gentleness . " Wash your face and come eat your supper , " Harvey said . " Oh , you ! " Willa cried . " I 'm through taking orders from you . What do you care what happens to mc ? I 've taken all I 'm going to off you . I could n't go to-night , but I 'm going ! I 'm going to-morrow , and nothing'lI stop me . " " Not on the cream money , you 're not , " Edna said . " What do you know about my money ? " Willa said . " It 's not yours , I guess . " " It 's not Tom 's to give , " Edna said . " Arid it 's a cinch you 've done nothing to earn it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Me leave her alone ! " Edna cried in her heavy , harsh voice . " I can get her meals , and wash the sheets off her bed , when she 'll get out of it , and see you make a fool of yourself over her in front of your family all winter , and when you give her the cream money  --  I can just leave her alone ! " Grandpa Young got up from his chair and lifted his hands and shookthem , palms up , in front of him . " Children , children ! " he said , " stop it ! This 's no way to do . Sit down , sit down , all of you . Sit down ! " Willa , her eyes still rimmed with dusty tears , went to her place and Harvey went to his . Mama Young went to her husband and stood beside him , twisting her hands in her apron . " This is all wrong , " Grandpa said . " There 's no sense in it . We 've worked all our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make this place and keep it ; to bring you boys up , the best we could , and get you started . Things 've been bad , and that you 've had hard luck and are here we 're not blaming you , and you 're welcome . Mama and I 've done our level best to make you feel welcome . We 've had a bad , dry year and the worst spring I ever saw , and I do n't know how it 's going to be or if we 'll have any crops at all , but we ai n't destitute . We got this place and work to do when it 's fit and no sickness . We got canned stuff in the cellar , and nobody 's gon na go hungry . " I do n't know what 's gon na be , but one thing I do know  --  this is gon na stop , this feeling and contention , and back talk ! What kind of men 've you grown up to be ? You look at one another , but look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act like you 're the men your uncles were ! " You got to cut it out . Look to your families and get on with your wives and children . We 've never had it in this house , Mama and me , all these years  --  this contention . Your women talking like that  --  running away to get jobs ! It 's a shame to this house . You got to cut it out . It 's too hard on your mother . " " Arch , " Mama Young said , turned from them and put her apron over her face . The room was quiet except for Willa 's coughing . One of Edna 's boys , overcome with the surprise and shame and quietness of the moment , slid under the table and stifled his giggles in his mother 's apron . Little Betty got down from her chair , went to her father and climbed onto his lap , rested her head against him , and said , " There is fruit in the cellar and strawberries . " Her voice rose in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Strawberries ! " Old Granma cried . " The best strawberries I ever ate we found one night when we were coming out here from Indiana . I ca n't for the life of me tell you what State it was in even , but I remember when we made camp I got down from the wagon and there , squashed on the wheel , was berries . 1 called to one of the women and I said , ' Here 's berries , ' and we got pails and all gathered till dark , gathered till we were just feeling for them in the grass . Such berries ! Arch  --  but that was before you were born , was n't it ? Well , there 's no tame berries nowadays 'll ever taste like a wild one . " Phyllis gave a gasping moan that she had been holding back all through Grandpa 's talk , and Old Granma , who had to be yelled at about almost everything , heard her , and said , " There , Mamie , what did I tell youl " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go upstairs , Baby ? " Ralph asked anxiously . " If you 'd rather , " Mama Young said , " we 'll fix my room for you , Phyllis , so you can be downstairs . " " Oh , no , " Phyllis said . " I  --  I want to go  --  home ! " " I 'll go over to Fergusons if you think I should now , Mama , to ' phone ? " Tom said . Edna went to the stove , built up the fire and filled the big teakettle . Little Betty started to follow her mother when she went to the stair door with Ralph 's arm about her , but hergrandfather called her back and took her on his knee . " I 'll tell you a story , " he said , stroking her hair gently . " Tell you a thing that happened when I was n't any higger'n Tommy here . " " Well , Willy , " Haney said , " looks like we better do the dishes . " " Dishes ? " Willa said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and come in here and wash dishes ! I guess . . . " Harvey pressed a thumb and finger either side her slender wrists , and said , " I guess so . " He let go her hands . Shc pulled an unironed apron from the line above her and tied it about her very slender waist and began scraping plates . Harvey helped her gather them up . He looked over at his father , where the old man sat with his granddaughter on his knee , as though he wanted him to see that for the moment at least , though he was doing it without enthusiasm , he was ruling his wife and without contention . Phyllis paused to rest part way up the stair and looked down through avenues of drying clothes , on her little daughter , on Edna , busy putting kettles of water to heat . Her mother-in-law was going ahead of her with the lamp , ready to stay up the night , to make the hours of pain and waiting easier for her . Tom had already gone , driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Arch , " Old Granma was shouting , " which way 's the wind from ? Be nice , all right , if it 'd rain to-night , would n't it ? " " It would , " Grandpa said , " though there 's nothing to warrant it . I was just startin ' telling the children here about a storm I was out in , going for cows when I was eight . It was just about this time of the year . " ( The story of this household will be brought to a close next month in Miss Thomas 's " The Home Place : Summer . " ? The Editors )
