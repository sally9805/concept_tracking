To win a 20,000 wager Phileas Fogg , cucumbrous hero of Novelist Jules Verne 's best seller , circled the globe in 80 days . This fictive feat remained a record until 1889 , when the late Publisher Joseph Pulitzer , casting about for a circulation-getter , ordered 22-year-old Nellie Ely to " knock about five days off this fellow Phileas Fogg 's record . " Globe-girdler Bly , bloomered and veiled , sailed from Hoboken , N. J. on a bow-spritted ocean greyhound , completed her stint in 72 days . <P> Since Nellie Ely 's day , the record has changed hands as often as wrestling titles . <P> First to round the world by commercial airline was the New York World-Telegram 's , Herbert Roslyn ( " Bud " ) Ekins ( 1936 ; 181 days ) . <P> Ekins ' record stood unchallenged till last month , when a wealthy widow named Clara Adams , famed in airline circles as an inveterate first-nighter , saw her chance . When Pan American 's Dixie Clipper soared away from Port Washington , L. I. on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Marseille her plans nearly went agley . Fellow-tripper Julius Rappaport of Allentown , Pa. , confessed that he too hankered to make a record . With chivalry worthy of Phileas Fogg , he finally withdrew , leaving Widow Adams unrivaled in the field .

But her biggest thrill came in the California Clipper nearing Honolulu , when she broadcasted over a Honolulu-San Francisco radio hookup . She did not strike rough weather until she encountered an electrical storm over Nebraska . <P> Sixteen days , 19 hours , 4 minutes after leaving New York , Widow Adams was back again . She had flown all the way . Total mileage : 25,000 . Cost : $2,500 . Chortled she : " That 's ten cents a mile . Can you travel cheaper than that ? "
