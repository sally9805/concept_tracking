txt Evidence was produced at the Senate munitions inquiry today that the E. I. du Pont de Nemours Company , on Feb. 1 , 1933 , entered into a contract with one Jungo Geira , described as " an international spy , " to act as its " exclusive agent " to negotiate the sale of military propellents and military explosives to the German Government . On the following day the executive committee of the du Pont company got its first view of the contract , and over the objections of Geira the document was recalled and " torn up . " Two weeks later a new contract was signed with Geira which stipulated that no contracts would be entered into for the rearmament of Germany except with the approval of the- United States Government . Later the company bought up this contract at a cost of 425,000 . Confer With Hull and Roper . An hour - before the committee convened this morning Secretaries Hull and Roper went to the office of Senator Nye , the chairman , for a conference with members on evidence of so important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Cabinet officers having jurisdiction in foreign and trade affairs . The conference lasted more than an hour , and evidence which the committee expects to develop at a hearing soon was discussed in detail . Secretary Hull has been bombarded with protests from abroad because of introduction into the record of the names of prominent foreign personages , while protests made to Mr. Roper refer to American trade relations and conditions in other countries . One report went the rounds of the committee to the effect that Senator Nye was " censoring " some of the evidence at the request of Mr. Hull . In the afternoon , after the " secrecy " which shrouded the conference had become a topic of more or less general comment , Mr. Nye declared in a statement that the conference was " occasioned upon the call of the committee itself . " He said : " The committee desired this conference in order that it might present to them ( Hull and Roper ) certain information and facts regarding matters not yet presented in the investigation and to request the cooperation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As has been the result in the past , the departments offered their complete cooperation . " American Guns for Nazis . Among other developments today were these : The part played by American small arms , particularly Thompson machine guns and revolvers , has been a major element in the operations of the Nazis and previously and to a small extent by the Communists in Germany , according to other evidence found in the du Pont files . Colonel William N. Taylor , in charge of the du Pont and Imperial Chemical Industries , Ltd. , offices in Paris , gave this information , first as a rumor in June , 1932 , then in greater detail and not as a rumor , in January , 1933 . The arms , said Colonel Taylor , were smuggled into Germany through Belgium and Holland and he added that Cologne was the centre of the " bootleg " trade in small arms . The hearing veered toward the Far East when letters from du Pont representatives were produced , referring to " commission " demands made by Chinese officials , among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record and this I was one of the factors back of the story that Senator Nye was " censoring " prominent names as well as other " important " information in the documents . Later in the day it was noted that 5'five cablegrams " to the du Ponts from South America . used as the ; basis of " veiled " questions , were withheld from the record . Their publication , it was declared by the committee , would mean serious " repercussions " in the country of their origin . All through the hearing today mention of " graft " continued to get into the record . Pierre du Pont , the oldest brother of the three who built up the huge concern and now retired from active participation in its affairs , admitted that the company had been asked for " commissions , " but said it had not paid them . He revealed that shortly after the outbreak of the World War Russia entered the American ammunition market and the company was advised that " commissions " were necessary to get the business . The du @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and subsequently got the business without having to pay the " commissions . " There was a Chinese transaction in which it appeared that somebody got a " commission . " Lammot du Pont admitted that it looked as if the commission was paid , but if so it was without his knowledge , he said . Geira 's Identity Traced . The contract for the sale of military propellents and explosives to Germany was disclosed early in the afternoon . Both the first and second contracts were signed by Felix du Pont , vice president of the company , and cousin of the three brothers , in both instances with the approval of Lammot du Pont , president of the corporation . Identification of Geira , " the party of the second part , " preceded the reading of the texts . " Is it true that Geira 's real name is Felix Brenner ? " asked Senator Clark , who was the committee examiner this afternoon . K. K. J. Casey , head of the explosives department of the du Pont plant , said he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international spy ? " " Yes , I know that . He told me so himself . I knew him as Jungo Geira , and he told me that he engaged in spy work in thirteen countries . " " Did he tell you , " went on the Senator , " that before we entered the war he was a spy for the Germans in this country , acting under the direction of von Papen and Boy-Ed , the military and naval attaches of the German Embassy ' in Washington ? " ' Spy ' Switched Sides . " Yes , I also received that information . " " And did you know that when we entered the war he quit the Germans and went to work for us so as to save his neck ? " Mr. Casey smiled his reply . It appeared to be an affirmative smile , for , according to the committee , Geira did " spy " work for this country after we entered the war . Turning to Felix du Pont , Senator Clark asked him if he had signed a contract on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammunition to Germany . Mr. du Pont said he had . Asked where the contract was , Mr. du Pont replied it had been " torn up " the day after it was signed . The committee had a copy , however . due to Geira 's " spy complex . " Before he surrendered his copy Geira photographed it . and this was disclosed to the du Ponts for the first time today . The principal clause in the first contract read : " The company hereby appoints and con*titutes the agent to act as its special agent for the Kingdom of Holland and as its exclusive agent for the Republic of Germany , to negotiate the sale of military propellants and military explosives to purchasers ( other than the Government of Holland and its colonies ) located in said territories . " The agent accepts such appointment and agrees that at all times during the continuance of this agreement he will use his best endeavors to promote the sale by the company of military propellants and explosives within the aforesaid territories . " Reservations Put In . The day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corporation met and the contract was brought up . Immediately , said Felix du Pont , he realized he had made " a slip " in that certain necessary reservations were missing from the contract , such as the approval of the United States Government of any contracts entered into and the restrictions provided for in the Treaty of Versailles . It was decided to recall the contract and Geira was sent for . Geira was " very reluctant " to consent to the cancellation , but finally , after " much persuasion , " consented . A second contract was then drafted and signed Feb. 15 . This contract provided that Geira should be the " exclusive agent to negotiate the sale of military propellants , military explosives to the Government of Germany " ; that Geira obligated himself to " use his best endeavors to promote the sale of military propellants and explosives by the company " ; and that " it was expressly understood that the company will not enter into contract " without first obtaining the approval of the United States Government The reason for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following language : " It is understood to be the desire and expectation of Germany to be relieved in the near future of the prohibitions and limitations upon the importation of arms and ammunition to which it is subjected under the terms of the Treaty of 1 Versailles ; and " It is the desire of the company to be in a position to furnish such requirements of military powders as Germany may be in the market for as the result of such relief . " After the second contract was drafted , Lammot du Pont sent a copy to Sir Harry , chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries , Ltd. , in London , who , replying on March 6 , 1933 , said he did not think the agreement afforded sufficient safeguards . Sir Harry prophesied that ' when the Treaty of Versailles was modified , the Germans would probably ask for a review of the entire armament-making situation . Whether or not this had anything to do with what followed , which was that the du Pouts gave Geira notice they would cancel the contract and subsequently paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not developed by the committee . A few months after the contract was canceled Geira showed up in Japan and sought to negotiate a contract for $500,000 worth of smokeless powder making machinery . He asked a commission of $50,000 . The deal did not go through . With the matter of the 1933 German contracts out of the way , the committee took up the shipment from this country of small arms to Germany , presumably for the arming of the political factions in that country , including Nazis and Communists . All this information was in letters from Colonel Taylor , the du Pont and I. C. I. representative in France . As to " Bootleg " Arms . The first of these documents was dated June 27 , 1932 , and in it Colonel Taylor , writing to Mr. Casey , referred to a recent visit to Holland . " I heard on my last visit to Holland , " he wrote , " that the German political associations , like the Nazis and others , are nearly all armed with American revolvers and Thompson machine guns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small weapons from America to Germany , the centre of which being Cologne and most of the bootlegging being done by Dutch . " Colonel Taylor explained that his information was largely rumor and to be considered as such . Under date of Jan. 9 , he wrote another letter dealing with the same matter . This time it was not rumor . In this letter , referring to the " bootleg " trade from the United States via Belgium , he wrote : " There is a certain amount of contraband among the river shippers , mainly In arms from America . Arms of all kinds coming from America are transshipped in the Scheldt to river barges before the vessels arrive in Antwerp . They can be carried through Holland without police inspection or interference . The Hitlerites and Communists are presumed to get arms in this manner . High Duties Blamed . " The principal arms coming from America are Thompson submachine guns and revolvers . The number is great . " Along the Limburg frontier there is a small traffic of arms into Germany , revolvers and small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Holland . " It is worthy of note , in view of the difficulties of trading , due to the fact that the politicians , in a desire to restrain abuses , have put so many restrictions , taxes , duties and licenses on legitimate irade that in all international business the amount of smuggling and fraud has increased enormously . " The illegitimate dealers pay no taxes nor duties and are free from all restrictions , hence they can outbid and outdeal the legitimate dealers . " The legitimate export of powder in Europe has not been above 200 tons in 1932 , but it is supposed that the illegitimate trade is over 1,000 tons , much of it made in Germany . " Over-control not only affects correct dealing but favors smugling . " So far . I have kept away from these smugglers , but I am going to Hamburg at the first reasonable opportunity and call on them to see what information I can get about the business . " " Decided Increase " in Trade . Again in a letter to Mr. Casey , dated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contraband in arms is increasing tremendously " and that " there seems to be the beginning of a decided increase in the ammunition business in Europe . " The committee used up much time questioning the du Ponts and Mr. Casey about an agreement involving the interchange of patents and processes entered into between the du Ponts , the I. C. I. and Dynamit Aktion Geselschaft . The agreement covered commercial and not military explosives . Lammot du Pont admitted that if necessary commercial could be substituted for purely military explosives such as TNT should an emergency arise . The State Department approved the transaction . At this point in the hearing Senator Bone got into an argument with ' rendes du Pont on the question of private or government ownership of munition plants . Before they had proceeded five minutes , President Roosevelt was brought into the discussions when Mr. du Pont made a reference to " government interference in business " and government by bureaucracy . Mr. du Pont said he had voted for Mr. Roosevelt in 1932 , and now , he added , " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a form of democratic government , " he declared , " but the way matters now stand I think our Constitution is on the verge of going into the scrap basket , and that 's why I have joined the Liberty Ldague . " Senator Nye asked Mr. du Pont if he or any of his brothers had a part in the drafting of the National Recovery Act . The answer was a unanimous " no . " However , they are signatories of the code of fair competition for the chemical industry . Successful efforts of du Pont and I. C. I. representatives to halt construction of a powder plant in the Argentine by Germans took up much of the morning session . The Argentine , it appears , is still without a powder factory and depends for her army and navy supplies principally on the United States and Great Britain , and this , it was indicated , meant the du Pouts and Imperial Chemical Industries , Ltd . It was also brought out that an agreement had been negotiated with the great Mitsui Corporation in Japan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pont processes . This transaction was fully reported to and approved by the State Department . Senator Nye said that the committee had evidence indicating that the $10,000,000 wheat loan made to China last year had been used to buy arms rather than to feed hungry Chinese . The afternoon session ended the du Pont phase of the inquiry . The affairs of United Aircraft will be taken up Monday when the hearings are resumed .
