" GO TALK TO MR . WARING " A STORY BY PHILIP CURTISS I HAD not lived in Berkfield County a week before I heard the name of Watts Waring , and after that I seemed to hear something about him every two or three days . He lived in the town of Chilton , twenty-odd miles away ; but whenever there was any regional enterprise , from the Salvation Army drive to the county symphonic festival , although the organizers from other towns might vary , according to the nature of the affair , yet the delegation from Chilton was invariably headed by " Hon. Watts Waring . " In private conversation it was even worse . One constantly heard people say , " I had lunch with Mr. Waring today . He sent his regards to you and the Doctor , " or , " Look here . Before we go any farther in this matter , why does n't someone run over and talk with Mr. Waring ? " Not even by going abroad could one escape that pervading name . In Bermuda or Honolulu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Berkshires someone would be sure to exclaim , " Then you must know Mr. Watts Waring . What an amazing per-sun he is ! " In time it began to irritate me , much as the Athenians were irritated by hearing Aristides constantly called " the Just . " Frankly I pictured this Waring as the local stuffed shirt , as a pompous , handshaking village grandee , and for two or three years I never even met him , probably because I was determined notto meet him . The time came , however , when I too had a problem that called for local knowledge and influence . From every side came the usual advice , " Go talk to Mr. Waring , " so , somewhat skeptically , I went . The matter that thus forced even me over the beaten trail was my Aunt Genevieve 's estate , a dead lump of worry that for half a generation had been hanging over one branch of our family . The estate now consisted entirely of a huge summer residence in Chilton , which my Uncle Tom had built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see that house was to get a perfect picture of Uncle Tom . He had been a man who prided himself on being intensely practical , with the result that he had built a house that was completely impracticable for any purpose whatsoever . In the first place , he had put it slam on the main street of the village , which had since become a concrete highway , with five-ton trucks rumbling by day and night . He had spent a small fortune on such things as brass piping , hidden drains , and copper roofing , but any elements of beauty , grace , or restfulness , which might make a summer home desirable , he had dismissed as so much fla-fla . The garden had bright yellow cement walks leading in every direction , the roofs of the great piazzas were supported by elephantine columns of rough cobblestone  --  but why go any farther ? Almost every village in rural New Eng-land has a similar architectural hemorrhage . Even when it was new there must have been few of Aunt Genevieve 's friends who could look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had cost sixty thousand dollars , because it had once been the largest house in town , Aunt Genevieve practically starved herself during the last years of her life paying the taxes and making pathetic repairs , such as a new roof for the unspeakable Japanese pavilion . Once when someone as foolish as Uncle Tom offered her half the original cost she turned down the offer in quivering disdain . Her own eyes told her that resort values all over the Berkshires were increasing by leaps and she was determined to sit tight on her original gold mine . For a year or two after Aunt Genevieve 's death her six scattered heirs or guardians of heirs apparently lived in the same illusion . When somebody had the idea of turning the place into an inn and made a half-hearted offer of eighteen thousand dollars , payable largely in mortgage notes , this also was curtly rejected ; but what judgment refused to admit time rapidly made evident . Year by year the small liquid balance of the estate was eaten up by taxes and insurance but now the depression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The day finally arrived when one more year would make the estate insolvent , and that was the precise moment when I was appointed administrator , vice Uncle Russell , deceased , and vice Uncle Harry , disgusted . A nice situation for a middle-aged painter , who had never done any legal business in his life , except , once , sue a picture dealer . So I did what everyone else did in times of trouble  --  I went to " talk to Mr. Waring " and of course I found him completely different from what I had expected . Instead of a puffy and unctuous glad-hander , I was met by a gentle and courtly man of sixty or more , with slow speech , humorous eyes , and snow-white hair parted rather smartly in themiddle . In fact , he reminded me then , as he has always reminded me since , of the first Oliver Wendell Holmes , granted that one could picture the first Oliver Wendell Holmes as wearing a very modern suit of good Irish homespun and as smoking an over-size Turkish cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting even more than his own appearance which suggested a man lifted squarely out of the ' fifties . He lived about half a mile from the village in a square yellow house with a cupola on the roof and a clock weight to swing the gate , and he received me in a worn , leather-chaired study which was littered from floor to ceiling with all the gear of an old-fashioned country gentleman . A double-barrelled shotgun stood in a corner , prints of old trotting horses hung on the walls , surveyors ' maps lay half unrolled on the tables , and in every conceivable spot were rows and piles of old books . It was not , however , one of these that Mr. Waring was reading as I entered the room , but that morning 's copy of a New York newspaper . As he rose to his feet I introduced myself . " My name is Burchard  --  from West Gosset . Dr. Moore suggested that I come and see you . " Mr. Waring lifted his hand deprecatingly . " No need for that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw you about a year ago at the dedication of the Gosset library . And naturally I know your picture of Bishop Gibbs . In fact , I must confess that I was pleasantly excited when I learned that one of the Burchards was moving back to the county . " " I was excited myself , " I replied , " but now I begin to wonder whether I had n't better have stayed in New York . " Mr. Waring smiled faintly as we both sat down . " What 's the trouble ? That Henderson property ? " " Precisely . I need some advice . " He smiled again . " I have discovered that no advice does very much good unless it merely confirms what the other person has already decided to do . " " In that case , " I answered , " the field is wide open . I have n't the faintest idea . " " Very well . Then let 's talk it over . ' ) So for an hour and a half we sat and talked . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial peace of the room had been highly deceptive . I presently realized that I had never been in a private house where there was such a constant and apparently normal flow of interruptions . Three times a grinning colored girl came to the door and announced that there was someone to see Mr. Waring , and every five or six minutes the telephone on the desk would ring . Then there would be a conversation that always followed the same routine . The person at the other end of the wire would talk steadily for a long time , the white-haired man in front of me remaining completely silent or merely interjecting a courteous , " Yes  --  yes  --  I see , " until the other person had run down . Then he himself would begin to talk  --  quietly , authoritatively , and equally without interruption . And apparently he always knew the answers . " Now , Fred , " he would say , " that question was all provided for by the school board three years ago . Mr. Haight made the motion . You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made in the teachers ' salaries and that , on the other hand , the teachers would not ask for increases until better times . But a special exception was made in the case of new teachers engaged at the minimum . They were to be increased gradually until they reached the average for the grade . So , obviously , Miss Hassen comes under the exception even if Miss Page does not . " Or , again : " Why , certainly , Father Flynn . I saw Mr. Harvey last night and he would be delighted to let you have the hall for your bazaar , just as you did last year . You will find that some of the tables are in the basement but most of them were taken out to the lake for the Legion clambake . I 'll call Sam Fuller and havesome of the boys go out and bring them back before Friday noon . " . Or , again : " Why , yes , Mr. Berry , the town does need some gravel . I should say about seventy-five loads  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that underpass leading in to the stone crusher . Of course I have n't got the final word but I 'd be glad to put in your bid . Only please remember that it must be real gravel and not fine sand , unless that is specifically ordered by the foreman on the job . " Each time Mr. Waring put down the receiver he turned back to me without concern and picked up our conversation just where he had dropped it , sometimes in the middle of a sentence . When I left , not much , on the face of it , seemed to have been accomplished . He had merely promised to " think it over " and see what could be done , but I went out of the house with an almost ludicrous feeling of relief , as if the whole matter had been lifted from my shoulders and I had nothing more to do . Unbelievably I was right . I did have nothing more to do . Ten days later I was called back to Chilton and told that a plan was ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thrifty Swedish contractor who would buy the Henderson place for eight thousand dollars . He intended to use the big stables to store his trucks and supplies , to build a little florist 's shop in the old gardens , and to cut up the house into small , inexpensive apartments , which were badly needed in the town . Naturally I approved and hastened off to write to the Henderson heirs who , by now , would need no persuading . Thereupon , in his same casual way , Mr. Waring secured an approving order from the probate court , instructed the local lawyer to search the title for the Swede , and had the deed drawn for me . He had already arranged to get a small mortgage for the new owner and of course , from the start , he had known of someone who was looking for a florist 's shop . In short , before I really came out of my haze I found myself sitting again in the old cluttered study with a certified check in my hand but with an embarrassing moment ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lawyer and not a real estate broker , yet it seemed incredible that he should not be offered some sort of compensation . At the same time I could not face the idea of trying to tip Oliver Wendell Holmes . As usual , he seemed to guess my perplexity before I even expressed it . I had merely lifted the check tentatively and got as far as the words , " Well , now , Mr. Waring ? " when he instantly raised his hand and waved the whole idea aside . " Oh , do n't even think of it , " he commanded . " I was glad to be able to do something for the Henderson children . " " You 're very good , " I murmured , but his words had only suggested another problem . " But now , with the property gone , " I asked , " what am / going to do with the money ? " He looked at me in surprise . " Are n't you going to divide it among the heirs ? " " I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them need it badly , but when poor Aunt Genevieve made her will she was apparently still under the delusion that she was going to leave millions and the principal can not be divided until the youngest grandchild comes of age . One of them is still only twelve . " Mr. Waring gave a low whistle . " I had forgotten that . " It was , I imagined , the only thing in his life that he ever had forgotten and it put him on his mettle . He sat musing for a minute or two and then looked up , smiling . " I 've had another idea in the back of my mind for some time , " he said . " Would you care to take a little ride ? " We drove away from the village , turned at a fork , and climbed up a side road which rapidly became just a country lane . As the road ended entirely , we stopped before a house which , to my eyes , was merely another edition of the one we had just sold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had no cobblestone excrescences , but it belonged to the same gray-shingle vintage , and a sagging sign in front suggested that it had been on the market just about as long . We got out and Mr. Waring waved his hand . " There ! " he exclaimed . " That place has fifty-four acres . It cost thirty-five thousand dollars to buy and build , but the Southbrook bank took it over , six years ago , for a ten-thousand-dollar mortgage . Offer them four and see what happens . " I looked at him incredulously . " But we 've just got out of that sort of fix . Why walk right into it again ? " Mr. Waring laughed . " The house that you sold looked down on a public garage and a chain store . You 're an artist . Turn round and see what this one looks on . " I turned and caught my breath . In front , two gentle hills opened in a perfect natural composition . Between them were far-off , hazy blue mountains and , nearer , green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole thing might have been a print by Currier &; Ives . Round us lay a sweet , country silence and over the road yellow butterflies played . Mr. Waring turned toward the house . " It 's still sound as a nut and brass piping really counts for something up here . It 's shabby , I know , but the lines are all simple and low . Paint that house a cream white , plant a few lilacs , and you 'll be surprised . Do n't forget that you 've still got all the furniture from the Henderson place and some of it is very good . There 's a young lady in town who can work miracles with slip covers , curtains , and that sort of thing . " He led the way to an unlocked back door and when we came out again in the sunlight I was as enthusiastic as he . " But why , " I demanded , " has nobody thought of this before ? " Mr. Waring 's eyes twinkled . " Have you never , " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any place and it scares off everyone without imagination . " " But the probate court ? " I insisted . " Would it ever approve an investment of this kind ? " " Oh , I 'll talk to the judge , " said Mr. Waring , nonchalantly . " Remember you 've got eight thousand dollars on your hands for nine years and the banks would give you only two per cent , even if they 'd take that much . If worse came to worst , this would still make a place for the Henderson children to lay their heads . " Need I report that , with that miracle man in charge , everything came out exactly as he said it would , except that the Henderson children never laid their heads there ? The summer after the house was restored and refurnished it was rented for seven hundred dollars . The next summer it brought nine and the second tenant liked it so much that he finally bought it , with the result that the estate , which had once been bankrupt , contained nineteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college . But all this was much , much later , and before the new house was even remodeled there occurred an event of a very different kind , one that at first promised to reverse Mr. Waring 's role and mine . For one bad hour it even threatened to upset the whole Watts Waring tradition , to knock all the blue sky out of our happy relations . But when I really had time to think it over  --  well , let me get on with the story . One afternoon , at my own place in West Gosset , I had a call from a man with whom I had gone to school and who was now an attorney for the Kunoes , one of the big industrial families of the East . He had come , he admitted frankly , because he wanted some confidential information and I was the only person he knew in the county . One of the Kunoe companies , in short , had a new product for which it needed a great deal of limestone , of which there were many small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several reasons the Kunoes did not want to buy the old quarries directly but if they could find a group of solid local men who would form their own company they would agree to take all the limestone produced . My friend , in other words , wanted the names of half a dozen such men . " I ca n't give you half a dozen , " I told him , " but I can give you the name of one man who holds the whole county in the palm of his hand . " I related my own experiences with Mr. Waring and my friend 's eyes sparkled . " Exactly the man  --  exactly the type of man we are looking for ! " he exclaimed . " I ca n't appear until it is time for our name to be known , but why do n't you , as a friend , go and sound him out ? " It seemed an almost spectacular chalice to return the very practical favors which Mr. Waring had done me and also , like many artists and writers , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the idea of being a personal emissary of the Kunoes , I called up Mr. Waring and made an appointment for the next day . When morning came , however , I found that I was frankly scared . The idea seemed as good as ever but that I , of all people , should he chosen to " sell " such a plan to the biggest man in the county appeared increasingly preposterous . Suppose he should be insulted . Suppose he should laugh at my innocence . Still , the name of the Kunoes was a very big one . As a compromise I drove over to Chilton half an hour early and stopped in to talk with Judge Ransom , who was both the local lawyer and the probate judge and with whom I had become quite familiar in our recent operations on the Henderson estate . Judge Ransom was a man of about the same age and background as Mr. Waring but personally he was entirely different . He was , in fact , one of those old-time Yankees who seemed to think that a life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner of outward gruffness . He was short and very fat and when I entered his office he was sitting in his shirtsleeves , filling out some legal document in a ponderous longhand . He greeted me affably enough but when I started to tell my story , in a halting , amateurish way , I could feel the atmosphere of the room grow stiffer and stiffer . Possibly I overworked such phrases as " certain big interests " and " take the entire output " but , in any case , the Judge 's only response was to stare heavily out of the window and bend a thin steel ruler into continual half circles . When I finished I was thus agreeably surprised to hear him answer : " Yes , that sounds like a very attractive proposition if the people behind it are responsible . " " Do n't worry about that , " I said , eagerly . " When you hear their name you wo n't ask any more . " The Judge , however , had gone back to work on his ruler . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for someone to organize this company . Whom did you have in mind ? " " It seems to me , " I replied , " that there is only one man in the county for it  --  Mr. Watts Waring . " The bent steel ruler popped out of the Judge 's hands and fell with a clatter half way across the room , but he did not even look up to see where it had gone . Instead , he turned his heavy eyes at me and replied , very slowly : " No , Mr. Burchard . Watts Waring is not the man you want . You tell your people to try someone else . " " You mean , " I asked , " that he would n't take it ? " " Oh , yes , I guess he 'd take it all right . He 'd probably feel that he 'd ought to . He knows where the quarries are , he could handle the labor , and possibly he could raise the capital . But , frankly , Watts Waring is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazement . Was it possible that , even now , the town of Chilton did not appreciate the rare talents of its leading citizen ? " I am not a business man myself , " I replied , rather stiffly , " but I happen to have known several quite big ones and I never saw one who could manage anything with more ease and more success . " " Perfectly true , " answered the Judge , " provided it 's your business or mine and provided he is n't paid anything for it . But give him a thing of his own , in which he really stands a chance to make a dollar , and he 'll let it lie on his desk all summer . " The Judge reached for his ruler , found it was missing , and limped on without it . " Mr. Burchard , " he asked , " how long have you lived in these parts ? " " Two years  --  almost three . " " And you 've never heard Watts Waring 's story ? " " Not that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm glad to hear that . I 'm glad it 's beginning to be forgotten . But have you ever noticed the color of Watts Waring 's hair ? " " Yes , it 's snow-white , but he still is not an old man . " " No , he 's not old . Yet his hair has been white for nearly twenty years . It turned that color in just six weeks . I might as well tell you , before someone else does . Watts Waring once had a bank . " " And the bank  --  failed ? " " No , it did n't actually fail , but it would have failed if all his friends had not come running from sixty miles around . There was nothing dishonest about it , you understand . Watts had poured in every cent of his own money and that was all that was lost , but for years he had been running that bank just as he runs everything  --  for everybody 's benefit but his own . His books were in order . There was some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good citizen had wanted a loan he just had n't been able to say no . " And it was n't only the bank , " continued the Judge . " Before that he dealt in timber and , now that you speak of it , " GO TALK TO he even once had a quarry , but the story was always the same . As long as he was mastering something purely for its own sake he was wonderful . But when the time came just to let the wheels turn and roll out the dollars his interest seemed to be gone . You 'd find he was off running for the legislature or was all tied up with the Guernsey cattle breeders ' association . " " But the townspeople seem to have confidence in him , " I suggested . " Is n't he the first selectman or something ? " " He is , " agreed the Judge , " and the best one we 've ever had . He 's filled every office in town and most of those in the county . Put him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . He can even get tough if he has to . Try to sell him an ounce of bad coal to heat the town hall and you 'll wish you had n't ; but fill his own cellar with slate and he 'll just laugh and pay you . " I shook my head . " It seems very strange . " " I/Vell , it 's not strange to me , " replied the Judge , " because I 've known another just like him  --  his own father . He was a shy , gentle man , more silent than Watts , a great lover of animals and flowers . For weeks at a time he 'd live in a cabin up on the mountain , just like a backwoodsman , studying the birds and the trees . He never did anything about it , never wrote any books . Apparently he just liked to lie there and look . Yet he carried half the families in town through the panic of ' 93 and when he died it was found that he had given away far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the money come from ? " I ventured to ask . " The grandfather  --  and there was a different man altogether . They say he was just as handsome as Watts and as open-handed . He sat in Congress and was governor of the State , but he also built up a big thread mill down on the river and left a large fortune for those days . His descendants inherited his looks and his charm and his public spirit and most of his brains but he could n't seem to give them that one single thing  --  the ability to make a cent . Perhaps they 'd had so much money all their lives that it did n't interest them any more . Or maybe it was their mothers . I 'm sure I do n't know . " I sat in silence , for I could see now , even from my own scant evidence , that everything the Judge was telling me was true . As if he realized that I was at last in sympathy , he went on , in a milder tone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Watts Waring ? Have n't you known men and women too who could throw their souls into work for a lodge or a church or a political party and yet , personally , never held a decent job in their lives ? They can raise half a million for a public memorial and yet they ca n't raise their own rent . The only difference is that Watts Waring is on a bigger scale than most of them and he 's found his real niche . We know him here , he fills a big place in the community , and we arc content to have him as he is . " I nodded . " But how does he live ? You say that the bank ? " " Oh , there was a little left out of that , " said the Judge , " when someone else took hold and made some of his customers pay their notes . And a man of that sort does n't really need a great deal of money . Give him a few of the luxuries of life and he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't got electricity in his house . It is still lighted by carbide gas , but there 's nowhere you 'll get a better glass of port wine . Also , a man like Watts ca n't help stumbling into a little money  --  provided strictly that he 's looking for something else . There 's always some State commission that wants his advice or enthusiasm and his various offices do bring in some fees . Strange as it sounds , he 's quite in demand to manage estates . " " I 'm not surprised at that , " I commented . " And then , you know , " mused the Judge , " when a man has spent his entire life casting his bread on the waters , some of it comes floating back in the most surprising ways . Not long ago a man whom Watts had almost forgotten died and left him twelve thousand dollars and every now and then one of those old bank notes pops up and gets paid . " The fudge leaned back . " Well , now , Mr. Burchard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like . " " Naturally , " I replied , " I am going to do nothing at all . I 'll go back to my people and tell them to form their own company , that the man I had in mind is too busy  --  as indeed he is . " " Good ! " said the Judge . " Just leave him alone . That 's all we ask . " I rose from my chair and on my way to the door I saw the steel ruler lying on the floor . I picked it up and handed it to the Judge , who took it with a smile . I myself , however , was not smiling as I went out into the hot village street . I got in my car , started toward home , and it was not until I passed the old Henderson place that I realized that I was going in the wrong direction , that I had not come to Chilton to see Judge Ransom but to see Mr. Waring . I turned in the driveway of a gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the square yellow house . As usual , Mr. Waring was telephoning when I was shown into his study and an old colored man , with his hat on his knees , sat beside the desk . The telephone message and the colored man were apparently parts of the same business , for when one was disposed of so was the other . Mr. Waring turned to me with his faint , pleasant smile . " Well , Mr. Burchard , what can I do for you ? " " I have come , " I answered , " to ask a favor , in fact an honor . As a very small token from the Henderson heirs I wonder whether you will allow me to paint your portrait  --  about like the one I did of Bishop Gibbs . " Of course he flushed and protested but I could see that at last I had offered him something that he really valued and , without too much argument , arrangements were made for him to come over to my place in West Gosset where he could be free from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin , because , apart from the pleasure of being with Mr. Waring , his white hair and patrician features made him a subject at which any painter would leap . Yet , oddly , before I was into the second or third sitting I began to realize that the portrait just would n't " go . " Possibly I now had two different men in my mind and could never be sure which one I was painting . Also , when Mr. Waring was sitting in silence , away from his own little kingdom and with someone from another world , certain lines would come into his face which had not been there before . It was as if , in this new atmosphere and in the presence of an art which he deeply respected , his mind would go back to parts of his own life of which , in his usual busy routine , he no longer found it necessary to think . At such times I would talk to him incessantly and the lines would disappear , but even so I could not forget them . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply paint him " straight " as I should have painted any respected but casual subject who had walked into my studio and would walk out again . In this way the work was eventually finished and professionally I knew that it was all right . For his part Mr. Waring was delighted . So were his friends and some of mine . Nevertheless , not even when it won a medal at an exhibition was I myself really satisfied with that portrait . I knew that I had not found a way to say some of the things that I was trying to say . And that , I suppose , is why I am saying them now .
