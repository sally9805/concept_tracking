Last week a few days before Adolf Hitler , Thomas Hart Benton celebrated his 50th birthday with a big party in Kansas City , Mo . ( see p. 18 ) and next day caught a train for Manhattan . The celebration there was even bigger-an over-all exhibition of his paintings from 1908 to 1939 . His first one-man Manhattan show in seven years , it was installed in a blaze of light at the opening of a new Fifth Avenue gallery by Associated American Artists ( TIME , Oct. 24 ) . <P> Two years ago Thomas Benton wrote an autobiography ( An Artist in America ) telling what he knew about the U. S. Few artists have seen as much . Benton looked on in awe at his father 's breakfast table 40 years ago as the Great Commoner , William Jennings Bryan , engulfed one poached egg on half a baked potato at every bite . He lived in raw Chicago in 1907-08 , brawled and bragged among the artists of Greenwich Village and Montparnasse , worked in a Norfolk shipyard in the War , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eye for the smoking valleys , the shanty boats on the rivers , the boom towns , tumbled farms and vast continental curve of his country . <P> In his painting , swarthy little Tom Benton was for years a self-confessed and monumental joke . In the last decade he has become a boisterous , likable candidate for the honor which awaits any artist who will seize and work mightily with the material of America . Benton has never painted a picture with the dramatic power of John Steuart Curry 's Line Storm or Tornado . Critics have found his color and texture slapdash and harsh compared to that of Iowa 's deliberate Grant Wood . But Benton 's style , an exuberant combination of cartooning draftsmanship , affectionate realism and tightly organized , undulating pattern , is the most imaginative and distinct of the three . <P> The new Benton show proved that it has done Tom Benton good to go to art school , even though it took his present teaching job at the Kansas City Art Institute to make him stay in one . Such simple little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year , impressed critics as new and less superficial renderings of what Benton has in his head . Most surprising , however , were a number of beautifully constructed still lifes with real depth and richness of texture . Said Tom Benton : " What there is in me to do I now know that I can do .
