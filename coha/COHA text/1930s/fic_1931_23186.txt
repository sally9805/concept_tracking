SUN BATH A STORY BY PHILIP CURTISS I N ANY town except West Gosset if an honest citizen should turn suddenly and find a state policeman standing at his elbow he would probably experience a certain feeling of shock . In West Gosset , however , such an encounter would have meant nothing at all ; for the civilian population had always been on the most informal terms with the half dozen gray-clad troopers who were stationed in its midst . Indeed , two of the men had been recruited from the neighboring district , while the sergeant commanding had married a West Gusset girl . The force as a whole occupied a definite social position in the village , so one sunny morning , as Molly Payson looked up from her flower beds and saw Sergeant Cassidy , very trim and official in his shining black puttees , descending from his car in the driveway , her thoughts were tinctured by anything but alarm . On the contrary , the wave that she gave him was almost fraternal . " Good morning , Sergeant , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The Payson gardens were among the show spots of West Gosset , and with no little admiration in his eyes , the Sergeant gazed over the rambling expanses of blossoming borders , graceful arbors , casual stepping stones , and soft lawn . " They 're elegant , ma'am , " he answered heartily . " My missus has got some gladiolus that are doing pretty good , but they 're way behind yours . Mr. Payson in ? " Molly laughed . " If he is , there 's only one place to find him . Let 's go and see . " At the steps of the west piazza she called , and from a deep navy hammock appeared first a newspaper , then a cigar , then a head ; but at sight of the officer Andy Payson rose to his feet . " Oh , good morning , Sergeant , " he said . " Come on up . " As Molly went back to her work , Sergeant Cassidy accepted a seat diffidently on the edge of a wicker porch chair , removed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was left on his forehead . " Mr. Payson , " he began , " there 's a rather funny matter come up , and I was wondering whether you would n't be the man to help us . " Andy appeared distinctly flattered . " Gladly , " he answered , " if I can . " " Well , I 'm not so sure , " replied the Sergeant , smiling faintly , " when you know what it is . " He paused a moment , then shot the worst . " You see , it 's about Miss Olympia Keith . " " Oh , good heavens ! " exclaimed Andy . " What 's she done now ? " " It 's not what she 's done , " said the Sergeant , " but what she 's threatening to do . She 's going to stand out in the middle of her lawn and play a bass horn in her pajamas . " " Play a bass horn in her pajamas ? " demanded Andy . " For goodness ' sake , what for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess , because she 's Miss Olympia Keith but , besides that , there seems to have been a bit of a rumpus . As near as I can make out , it all started over Major Hamilton 's sun baths . " Andy sat down abruptly . " Sergeant , " he said , " I was never very good at school , and even now my head is not quite like other people 's . Suppose you tell me this just as you would tell it to your little son . " The Sergeant laughed again . " It is a bit complicated , " he admitted , " but I thought maybe you 'd heard the first part . Anyway , you know that the Hamiltons ' place and Miss Keith 's are side by side and that only a hedge is between them , running down to the lake . " " Yes , that much I know , " replied Andy . " My head is a lot clearer now . I think you can go on . " " Well , as I get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like most other people , has got the sun craze  --  thinks that if he lies in the sun with nothing but a bath towel around his middle it will cure all his troubles . So he goes out and lays a blanket down on the hillside , next to the hedge , and tells the sun to go to it . The idea was that if anybody rowed near on the lake he could roll up in the blanket , but one day Miss Olympia Keith comes along on the other side of the hedge , where he was n't expecting anybody ? " " And catches him cold ? " suggested Andy . " That seems to have been the size of it , " admitted Sergeant Cassidy . " I guess  --  having been on the stage and all  --  Miss Keith did n't mind that sort of thing as much as most people . At any rate she lighted a cigarette , leaned over the hedge , and started to have a cosy little chat . For all I know , she was giving him points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just that moment a boat did come by near the shore of the lake and in it was Mrs. Hamilton . You can guess what happened . " " My first guess , " replied Andy , " would be that Major Hamilton stopped taking sun baths . " " If he did n't , " answered the Sergeant , " at least he stopped taking them there . And , from that day on , Mrs. Hamilton had the icy eye for Miss Olympia Keith . One thing led to another until , about three nights ago , Miss Keith had a party . Between you and me , " nodded the Sergeant , wisely , " I guess that it was a pretty gay affair . There was some of her stage friends and a bunch from the artists ' colony over in Lebanon , and along about two o'clock in the morning somebody seems to have got a French horn and begun to play solos under the pine trees , with the result that the next day Miss Keith got a note from Mrs. Hamilton . She told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not Broadway and , the next time that Miss Keith wanted to entertain Sousa 's band , would she please hire a hall ? At that Mks Keith comes back with a note of her own and says that she 'll entertain whoever and whenever she blooming well pleases . Then she tells everybody in town that she 's sent to New York for the biggest bass horn that money will buy and that every night , just before she goes to bed , she 's going to stand out on her lawn and play Lonely Acres ' . " " A pretty scene ! A pretty scene ! " commented Andy . " But where do you enter the picture ? " " I enter the picture , " replied the Sergeant , " when Mrs. Hamilton comes down to the barracks . She 's heard what Miss Keith is threatening to do and says that if she pipes a note she wants her arrested as a public nuisance . " " Sounds to me rather fun , " mused Andy . " Why not let the drama unfold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Payson , " pleaded the Sergeant , suddenly becoming his true paternal self , " I know it 's funny when you try to tell about it , but what kind of business is this for two respectable ladies in a town like West Gosset ? Of course up here on the hill you people all understand Miss Olympia Keith and you also know Mrs. Hamilton ; but just think how it 's going to look around town . How can I go down by the tracks and arrest Mary Powlick for throwing a bottle at Kate Finn if right up here on the lakefront two of our swelled ladies are fighting like badgers ? No , Mr. Payson , the only thing is to stop this foolishness before it begins . " Oh , I suppose so , " agreed Andy , somewhat disappointed . " l3ut what did you have in mind ? " The Sergeant grinned , rather maliciously . " To tell the truth , Mr. Payson , I had you in mind . " " Me ? " exclaimed Andy . " What in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just a little matter of diplomacy . Fact is , Miss Olympia Keith thinks a lot of you . " Andy stared at him , incredulously . " Olympia Keith ? Oh , no , Sergeant , you 're miles off the track . Of course I know her  --  the way everybody does  --  but I do n't suppose I 've really spoken to her twice in my life . " " Well , that 's all right , " answered the Sergeant sagely . " I know what I know . You see my wife 's sister has sewed for Miss Keith ever since she 's been in town , and when Miss Keith has something on her mind she does n't keep it to herself . The first day she came here she saw you go by . You were riding that big chestnut horse youused to own and you had on white riding breeches and spiffy brown boots , and Miss Keith says to someone , ' Now I know why I came to West Gosset . ' Even now , every time you go by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ha ! The young master ! ' She also speaks of you as Honey-Love ' ? according to my wife 's sister . " Andy 's face had become like a Turner sunset . " Well if that 's the case , " he replied , " the one thing for me to do is to go in the house right away and lock all the doors . I will admit that at various times in my life I have courted adventure , but not with Miss Olympia Keith . " " Now , Mr. Payson , " begged the Sergeant soothingly , " there 's nothing to get scared about , and if you people up here at the lake do n't hush up this matter , who 's going to do it ? Just go over and say a few quiet words to Miss Keith , and I 'm certain everything will be all right . " As Andy still sat , hesitating and silent , the Sergeant added what experience had probably taught him to be the most powerful weapon in a policeman 's repertoire . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any of my boys can do you a favor , you can be sure that we wo n't forget it . " Whether or not that clinched the argument , Andy cleared his throat . " Well , anyway , " he suggested , " suppose you let me think about it . " " Certainly , certainly , " answered the Sergeant , rising . " But please do n't make it too long . Almost any night now we may hear the music . " Among many other points of wisdom , Sergeant Cassidy had learned when to end an interview and with a wave of his hand he went down the steps but , a moment later , Molly replaced him . " What did the Sergeant want ? " she demanded . " You 'll never guess , " answered SUN Andy , gloomily . " He wants me to go over and talk to Olympia Keith . " " Is that a law now ? " asked Molly , puzzled . Then suddenly came enlightenment . " Oh , of course  --  that crazy business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Helen Perrier . But why does he want you ? " Very naturally this was one phase of the interview on which poor Andy did not care to touch . " Well , he seemed to think , " he answered slowly , " that it would be a very disgraceful affair for West Gosset if it ever went very far . He thought it was a matter for us in the lakeshore crowd to smooth over quietly by ourselves . " Strangely enough , this was an argument that appealed to Molly . " I think he 's exactly right , " she answered heartily . " Of course Mrs. Hamilton can be peculiarly unbearable when she puts on the Queen Victoria stuff , but , after all , she is an older woman and entitled to respect . It 's just about time that someone who is well known and respected in the village gave Olympia Keith a few pretty stiff hints . You 're going to go , are n't you ? " " Then you do n't mind ? " asked Andy , in surprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked straight at him . " Andy Payson , " she said , " if you could be such a flathead as to fall for Olympia Keith , our whole love life has been but a sham . We might just as well sit right down now and divide the children and all the garden tools . " Andy laughed but as , even now , he did not seem quite convinced , Molly added , briskly , " Oh , naturally I would n't want you running around there every morning , but this is a simple question of neighborhood policy . It 's just a matter of a little quiet tact . " " You and the Sergeant , " suggested Andy , " seem to have a very funny idea of what constitutes a quiet little matter . Why do n't you go yourself  --  or Helen Perrier ? " " Now , Andy , be sensible , " ordered Molly . " You know that no woman in West Gosset has ever called on Olympia Keith , and we certainly could n't begin with a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment we tried . " " Every word you say makes it easier and easier , " replied Andy . " Do I like being stuck ? " " But men are different , " argued Molly , " and you know they are . You could just drop in as if it had merely happened  --  tell her you wanted a subscription for the fire department or something of that kind . Then you could casually bring up some laughing reference to Mrs. Hamilton , and the whole thing would be forgotten inside of an hour . " " Well , I do n't know , " mused Andy . " Just let me think , " As a period of quiet meditation was a usual preliminary for everything that Andy ever did , Molly accepted this as a sign of progress and went into the house , while Andy himself , taking the chair that had been vacated by the Sergeant , lighted a fresh cigar and let his eyes wander over what might very soon be the scene of the crime . Beyond the piazza rail , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a resting place , lawns and gardens sloped down to the sparkling blue waters of Lake Winnemaug . The nearer shore , which was still heavily wooded , lay entirely within the limits of the Payson estate , but the right hand , or northern , shore , containing a public beach and boat houses , was separated only by narrow , opeu fields from the village of West Gosset , while the farther , or western , shore of the lake was divided among several small summer properties . Among these Andy 's eye could easily distinguish the white fa  --  ade of Mrs. Hamilton 's cottage  --  chaste , Geor-gian and , like Mrs. Hamilton herself , utterly correct  --  while , partially hidden in a neighboring grove of trees was a darker English cottage which , for nearly two years now , had been recognized as the trouble spot of West Gosset . For if , as the Sergeant had somewhat too generously stated , the half dozen families living on the lakefront had really understood Miss Olympia Keith , they would have succeeded in doing something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in short , was one of those people who seem to become almost national figures , without anyone , apparently , knowing just why . At one time , to be sure , she had had a certain brief prominence on the stage , and if you had mentioned her name to people in the theatrical world they would have exclaimed , " Olympia Keith ? Oh , surely , surely ! " but if you had further asked them what she had ever played , or when , they would have been considerably put to it to answer , as her stage life was now definitely in the past , and the later and better known years of her progress had apparently been devoted to the curious ambition of being recognized as America 's craziest woman . Miss Keith was one of those ex-actresses who are constantly reported as engaged to prize fighters or maharajahs ; she was endlessly suing or being sued by somebody , and she could never come into New York on a steamer without being caught by the customs officers with a string of pearls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom she had apparently acquired a considerable afiluence , but all of them had long since disappeared from the pages of history and no one now even remembered their names . Why Olympia Keith had ever come to West Gosset was a point as mysterious as everything else in her career , but there she was , and now Andy Payson was faced with the problem of what to do about it . For certain people of vast efficiency a period of meditation may always bring results but , after half an hour of it , poor Andy found his ideas no farther advanced than when he had started . Feeling , indeed , neither confidence nor enthusiasm for his enterprise , he went to the garage and , backing out his runabout , drove slowly around the southern , or more secluded shore of the lake . A run of five minutes brought him to the end of his journey where , parking his car with somewhat unusual care in the shelter of the bushes , he walked down a slope , through a pleasant grove of elm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's screen door . There came no answer , and as he patiently waited Andy looked about him . And as he looked he had to admit that Miss Keith knew how to arrange a cosy little nook . On both sides of the doorway careful plantings of laurel and native underbrush merged into a woodland shade at which Wordsworth himself would not have sneezed , while inside the screen door could be glimpsed a dim , Persian-rugged hallway as modest and restful as any in West Gosset . He knocked again and this time a distant voice answered : " Hello ! Come on in . " Obeying the summons , Andy passed through the dim hall to another screen door which opened on a flagstone terrace overlooking the lake . Here be waited , uncertain , until suddenly he heard a stirring to his right and a voice came from outside the door : " Well , bless my soul ! The answer to prayer ! " Opening the door , Andy stepped to the flagstones and saw Miss Keith stretched in a chaise longue in the cool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whirl of silken draperies which Andy did not quite dare to analyze , she rose to her feet and came forward , holding out both her hands . On her face was a look of ecstatic amazement . ip " Mr. Payson ! " she exclaimed . " I ca n't believe it Tell me it is true . For half an hour I have been sitting here in the sunlight , looking down at 4/0 the lake and thinking to myself , ' Now , this would be absolutely perfect if 011137 I had the right person here to enjoy it with . ' Then I started thinking and wondering whom I would choose from all the wide world . Napoleon ? No . Richard Barthelmess ? No . Then , as I sat thinking , I happened to see your house on the other side of the lake and I shut my eyes and I made myself tense and I said , Kindly Fates , send me him ! ' " Without knowing just when it had happened , Andy found that he was still holding both her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little shake . " And now you are here ! " she exclaimed . " Tell me  --  honestlywhat made you come ? " Andy blushed . He could hardly answer , " The Police Department , " but his embarrassed silence only seemed to delight Miss Keith the more . " Well , never mind what sent you , " she exclaimed , " so long as you are here . " With the attitude of a Greek slave welcoming a Roman emperor , she pushed another chaise longue beside her own . " For you , my lord . " As Andy relaxed somewhat awkwardly on his long chair , Miss Keith bounded happily back to her own while , from her proximity , came a faint scent , exotic and disturbing  --  distinctly Oriental . At the same time , with the gay sweep of her movements , Andy realized that what he had taken for silken draperies were nothing more or less than pajamas  --  very super pajamas , to be sure , but nevertheless pajamas , possibly the identical ones that she had in mind for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea did not now appear so preposterous . Lifting her slipper-clad feet to the cushions , Miss Keith gave the flowing garments a final tug and a pat . " Well now , " she said , " do you want to talk or just sit and dream ? " For the moment poor Andy had no ideas on that subject , for , sitting thus in the morning sunlight and in such unexpected intimacy , he had suddenly grasped a fact that no one , oddly , had seen fit to mention . This was the fact that in certain lights and in certain attitudes Miss Olympia Keith could be the dickens of an attractive person . Considering her history , this discovery might have seemed a bit tardy ; but so accustomed had Andy been to hearing her spoken of as " that woman " that unconsciously he had grown to think of her as he might have thought of an Amazon or a sword-swallower . Seen now , however , with flecks of sunlight on her fluffy , girlish , auburn hair and with her slight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the least look like a sword-swallower . She looked , to be frank , about twenty years old and a very innocent twenty at that . As Andy was now forced to realize , nothing in this world ever happens without a reason , and even to be an outrageous person calls for some basic talents . Seeing Olympia Keith as Andy now saw her , the three legendary husbands did not at all appear like the utter idiots that they might previously have seemed . A minute more and Andy would be believing in the Maharajah . As if reading his thoughts , Miss Keith turned toward him and smiled lazily . " Do you mind ? " she asked and held out her hand . How could Andy mind ? The next moment he not only found that he was holding her hand but that all their fingers were interlaced , while on their cushions both of them had sunk back in a peace that was almost sultanic . On the lake , far below them , a canoe with a little leg-o ' - mutton sail had put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost exactly like it , appeared from the opposite side . With the faint wind abeam of each , they were sailing directly towards each other , and suddenly it became fascinating , almost exciting , to watch the gap close slowly between them and wonder how long it would be before they would meet . Miss Keith also was apparently enthralled by the spectacle for , still holding Andy 's hand , she gazed down from her cushions , her eyes dreamy , her lips slightly parted ; but , when the two little sails were still six or eight lengths apart , one of them suddenly turned and scuttled for the other end of the lake . " Coward ! " exclaimed Miss Keith , and Andy laughed aloud . By common consent , however , the " just sit and dream " suggestion seemed to be winning , and for three or four minutes neither of them spoke again . The sun , slowly changing position overhead , sent delicious new warm spots on their outstretched knees . From the far-off village to the Ieft came busy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor horn and the rattle of a dump wagon unloading crushed stone on the highway while , at some unseen wharf , hidden by the trees below them , a group of small children plunged into the water with shrieks and shoutings . As the sun baked hotter on the flagstone terrace , a row of boxwood bushes gave out a faint , sickly-sweet smell , like a garden in Italy , while a roving bumble bee looked into the matter , then moved away . Miss Keith gave a troubled , uneasy stir , like that of a sleeping child , then deliberately drawing Andy 's hand to her lap , she studied it for a moment , as if to see wherein and how it differed from all other hands . Very gently she placed her own other hand over it . " Mr. Payson , " she asked , suddenly , " do you think that T am a very had woman ? " " Does it seem sop " laughed Andy . " No , I mean it seriously , " answered Miss Keith . " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town does . " " Why do you say that ? " asked Andy , but Miss Keith only shook her head impatiently . " Please do n't bother to be evasive , " she commanded quietly . " You know as well as I do that not a single person in town has been here in two years , except the tradesmen , and that even at big things , like the country club , groups mysteriously dissolve when I go near them . " " Do you care ? " asked Andy , and his question was genuine . So also was Miss Keith 's answer , as she looked again toward the lake , her eyes thoughtful and distant . " I wonder whether I do , " she replied slowly . " I mean whether I care . Theoretically I should n't . I have always lived just the life that it pleased me to live  --  done just what I wanted . I have also recognized that I must pay the price . Still , one is human . No one in reality likes anyone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cushions , at the same time curling her legs under her . " Mr. Payson , " she said , " I 'm going to tell you something . Yes , I do care , if you want to know . I have always prided myself on the fact that I could get along with all sorts of people , and still without ceasing to be myself . You may laugh at me if you want , but I had quite a little ideal in coming here to West Gosset . I 've ' had my fun where I found it ' and all that sort of thing , but in the back of my head I 've always had the idea that I 'd like to end up in a place like this , with a sort of horse-and-bound , call-on-the-vicar kind of crowd , where I could be proper SUN but not too proper and where I could just loaf around with four or five easygoing but still really decent souls and look back and laugh at the whole thing . " " I see , " nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that way ? " Miss Keith laughed curtly . " You know blame well that it has n't worked out that way . To dear old West Gosset I am still America 's tin pan darling , the whoopee girl from the Great White Lights . Oh , of course , " she broke off , abruptly , " I do n't mean that I want to put on white gloves and go to the poetry circle but I should like to think that people here in town would say to each other , ' There 's Olympia Keith . She 's a blame good sort . ' I 'd like to have an open fire going on autumn afternoons with the idea that someone or other would always drop in  --  drop in in twos and threes  --  your sort of people . " She patted his hand . " For , after all , you know that you are quite a sweet soul . " Andy 's eyes turned and met hers  --  looking at him very solemnly  --  and when he answered his voice was a trifle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that I can understand that . " He also laughed briefly . " I do n't mean what you said about me but about the rest of it , You mean with a bottle of Scotch always on the table and a dog to come into the room and sniff at people 's knees . " " Precisely , " said Miss Keith . " Now , honestly , is n't there room even in West Gosset for that sort of person ? " She was still holding his hand as Andy turned toward her , with a. distinct twinkle in his eyes . " If you must know the truth , " he answered , " West Gosset would be a eery much nicer place with that sort of person in it . If  --  I may say  --  you have the dog , I have the knees . " " Splendid ! " exclaimed Miss Keith . " Now that 's all settled . When do we start ? " Andy , however , had suddenly sobered , and around his eyes faint , troubled lines were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he suggested , " is something that I 'd like to discuss . Your idea is excellent . I 'm heart and soul for it , but to make it go big with the public is n't there one little problem that ought to be ironed out ? " Miss Keith dropped his hand and stiffened slightly . " Just what do you mean ? " " Well , " remarked Andy , slowly , " out of a thousand ways to promote the bonhomie spirit and start the ball rolling , was it absolutely necessary to begin by poking a nice old lady in the nose ? " For a minute , even now , Miss Keith pretended not to understand him , then suddenly she laughed . " Oh , you mean Mrs. Hamilton ! But in the first place she 's not a nice old lady . She 's a despicable old shrew . And as for that , all that I did was to stop in most neighborly fashion and tell Major Hamilton that the small of his back was almost done . " " Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Major 's back ? " " I wish you 'd seen it , " broke in Miss Keith . " Three minutes more and it would have been a mass of blisters . And after all it was fifty-fifty . When he would n't believe me , I offered to show him mine . " " Fair enough ! " laughed Andy . " But , having done your little act of kindness and mercy , will nothing now make you happy except a. bass horn ? Would n't a piccolo do , let us say , or a soft-wood marimba ? " " Oh , goodness ! " exclaimed Miss Keith . " Have you heard about that , too ? But they got it all wrong down in the village . It was n't a bass horn . I could n't even lift a bass horn . It would weigh twenty tons . It was nothing except a bass saxophone that I had in mind . I 'm really marvellous on a bass saxophone . " She half rose from her chair . " Do you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please ! Please ! " he begged . " Sometime , when the autumn fires are lighted and the vicar drops in , I think that it would be splendid , but frankly I believe that you ought to get the dog first . " " Just as you say , " replied Miss Keith , settling back on her cushions . " I 'm clay in your hands . " Then abruptly a terrible idea seemed to come to her mind . " Mr. Payson , " she asked , " is that really why you came ? " " Is what really why I came ? " replied Andy . " Just simply to lecture me , " answered Miss Keith . " A delegate of the public peace and the general welfare  --  to cow me properly into my place and tell me that I must be good and respectful to all of my neighbors ? " " Well , I ? " began Andy wretchedly , but he was a very bad liar , and Miss Keith would not even listen to him . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you came . And poor , innocent I thought it was nothing but sheer sex appeal . " " Is that why Napoleon would have come ? " asked Andy . " Well , I do n't know so much about Napoleon , " confessed Miss Keith , " but at least I do n't believe that he would have bothered a great deal about Mrs. Hamilton . " " Neither am replied Andy , recovering , bravely . " Neither am I bothering very much about Mrs. Hamilton . " " Then who are you bothering about ? " " I 'm bothering about you , " said Andy quietly . Miss Keith looked at him meditatively . " Just try that again , " she suggested . " You might do it better the second time . " " All right , " repeated Andy , looking straight into her eyes , " I am bothering about you . " For a moment Miss Keith returned his gaze steadfastly , then her own eyes dropped . " That time , " she said , " I almost believed you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as usual , and she wriggled toward him . " Here , give me that hand , " she commanded and , as Andy obeyed her , she spread out his fingers on the arm of her chair . " And so , " she said , pensively , " you want me to stop ? " With the tips of her own fingers she was now softly tracing the lines in his palm and she added , quickly , " I mean stop playing the saxophone  --  not stop doing this . " " Well , " replied Andy , " would n't it be just a little bit wiser if you did stop ? But I also refer only to your first question . " " I see , " mused Miss Keith . " Then that is the price of West Gosset 's nod . A sober , silent , and industrious life and a bob and a curtsy to all the old ladies . It is , I confess , a rather higher price than I had intended to pay . But perhaps it is worth it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked at him squarely . " But have I , " she demanded , " got to do it all ? Suppose I do throw my saxophone into the lake and say ' Yes , ma'am ' and ' No , ma'am ' to Mrs. Hamilton . What are you going to do about it ? " " What do you want me to do ? " asked Andy . " Well , for one thing , " laughed Miss Keith , " you might stroke my hand at least part of the time , instead of letting me stroke yours . " " An idea indeed ! " replied Andy and as , somewhat awkwardly , he put it into effect , Miss Keith watched his work with a practiced eye . " That , " she commented , " is just about the way in which I would have expected a representative of the public peace and the general welfare to stroke ply hand . I can see plainly that when one lives in the country one rusts . We must look out for that when the autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and touched his lips to her wrist . " That better ? " he asked . " Oh , very much better , " applauded Miss Keith . " That 's practically original sin . " Just the same , she stopped him gently and tucked his hand under her arm . " Not too much at a time , " she suggested , " if you 're not used to it . After all , the meditative silence goes more with your type . " From somewhere on the lake below them came the putter-putter-putter of a motor boat and they both looked up expectantly but nothing appeared and , after a moment , even the sound had ceased . The bee came buzzing back to the boxwood , again saw that he had been fooled , and went humming off . The water of the lake , which had been blue and sparkling , was now dark green and glassy while the full noon sun beat mercilessly down . From the direction of the village came the sudden whine of a siren whistle . Miss Keith started with lively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm sorry to disappoint you , but that only means twelve o'clock . " " Oh pshaw ! " said Miss Keith . " Just the same old story . In West Gosset , then , even sirens become domesticated ? Their principal duty is to call people home to lunch ? " " I 'm afraid so , " Andy laughed , as he swung his feet from the long chair to the flagstones . " And , unhappily , I am one of those called . " With an air of dismay , Miss Keith also swung her feet from her chair and stood up beside him . " But , " she exclaimed , " we have n't got anywhere yet ! " " We have n't ? " smiled Andy , and Miss Keith actually blushed . " I mean , " she explained , " that you do n't know at all , yet , whether your errand was a success . " " You mean , " suggested Andy , " whether saxophones sound or whether fires are lighted in the fall ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Keith . " I do n't care whether I ever hear about them again . " " The words of sound reason , " applauded Andy . " I think , myself , that there is much more promise in the idea of autumn fires . " Yet , even then , they stood there , uncertain and expectant , a look of faint mischief in Miss Keith 's eyes and an answering twinkle in Andy 's own . He moved slightly forward , and his arms were half lifted . " But the autumn , " he suggested , " seems a long time to wait . " " Exactly , " said Miss Keith . " That was just what I was thinking , " and the next instant she was locked in his arms . Around him in waves and in billows seemed to float miles of silken pajamas and , under his own , were two laughing eyes . A swallow skimmed under the trees , took one look and abruptly departed , while , this time , a honey bee ? one who really knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work . Around his neck Andy felt two slender arms , tightly clasped  --  his lips were slowly descending when , suddenly , they both sprang apart . From the lake again , but now very loud and near , had come that same putter-putterputter and a moment later , from behind the thick screen of trees on the shore , glided a long , glistening motor boat . In the cockpit , turning the pages of a magazine , was Molly 's best friend , Helen Perrier , while at the wheel , looking straight ahead , was Molly herself . For an agony of suspended time the boat glided across an open space , then , as suddenly as it had come , disappeared behind the trees . Miss Keith glanced at Andy , completely aghast . " Was n't that . . . ? " she asked . " Yes , " replied Andy , " it was . " " And do you suppose , " gasped Miss Keith , " that they could have possibly seen us ? " " That , " confessed Andy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am going to learn . " " Oh dear ! " wailed Miss Keith , " I do hope they did n't . Because then the vicar would never come to see me , and this time I should have to play two lone saxophones  --  one on each side of the lake . " For a moment she stirred around , perplexed and unhappy , then suddenly the dash of mischief came back to her eyes . " Oh , well , " she sighed , " if you 're going to he hanged , you might as well be hanged good and plenty . " " You mean ? " suggested Andy . Of course I mean  --  that we might just as well finish that kiss . " Half an hour later a bruised and bewildered creature who had once called himself Andy Payson drove up to his own doorway  --  distinctly surprised to find that it was still there . He glanced around cautiously , through the lower hall , but the only sign of life was furnished by Edwin , the colored butler , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cheerfully operating a vacuum cleaner . Even he seemed to have no inkling that the world had come to an end , and Andy felt his confidence begin to return . " Mrs , Payson home yet ? " he asked . Edwin turned off the switch of the cleaner in order to make himself heard . " No , Mr. Payson , but she just telephoned from Mrs. Perrier 's boat house that she 's bringing Mrs. Perrier back to lunch . " This at least was promising , for if the last chapter of Molly 's married life were about to be written she would hardly have brought home Helen Perrier to be in at the death . Still more reassured , Andy continued through the hallway but suddenly , in the familiar atmosphere , he was conscious of something that he bad not previously noticed . Furtively , he raised the sleeve of his coat to his face and ? yes , it was unmistakable ? a faint scent , exotic and distinctly Oriental . With assumed carelessness , Andy turned to Edwin , who was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I 'll be upstairs , changing my clothes , if anyone calls . It 's growing pretty warm for tweeds . " " Yes , sir , yes , sir , " replied Edwin , enthusiastically . " This time of year we got to expect a good deal of steam . " In the silence of his own room , however , Andy found that changing his clothes was not by any means all that he wished to do . In increasing bewilderment and amazement , he was also wondering just how much sponging and pressing he would have to do to his soul . For now , with the peace and solidity of familiar surroundings , it was increasingly unbelievable that the morning 's adventure had ever really happened , that his strange two hours had not been the wildest kind of a dream . Stepping from a cool shower , he slipped on a bathrobe and wandered to the open windows which , like the piazza below , looked over the lake . Yes , there it was , exactly as he had seen it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown English cottage , dreaming demurely in its grove of oak and elm trees . Was it even credible that , half an hour before , he , a quiet married man and pillar of West Gosset society , had actually stood on the open terrace of that cottage , embracing an auburn-haired lady in silk pajamas ? Why , Major Hamil-SUN BATH Q95 ton and his sun baths ! Andy laughed suddenly . Major Hamilton was a positive beginner compared to him ! So engrossed indeed did Andy become with this amusing speculation that he was not even conscious of the slam of a screen door below , but a moment later he did hear light running steps on the polished stairway . He had scarcely time to busy himself with a sock when Molly appeared , bright and eager , at the doorway . " Oh , here you are ! " she exclaimed . " What luck did you have ? " " What luck ? " repeated Andy , vaguely , and at his apparent incomprehension Molly 's face fell . " With Olympia Keith , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your nerve and did n't go after all . " A huge wave of relief passed over Andy , as he leaned down and fastened a garter . " Oh , yes , I went , " he replied . " And she 's really a very good sort . " " Well , anyway , I hope she 's reasonable , " said Molly . " You can tell me all about it at lunch , " she commanded , hurriedly , as she passed into the adjoining room . " My one desire now is to get into something cooler . It was hot as sin out on the lake . " " So was it on the other shore , " replied Andy . " I decided to change , myself . " So that was that ! And as for the autumn fires , they would in time have to take care of themselves . But just what , Andy wondered , was Olympia Keith herself thinking now ? Was she laughing at him ? Did she really mean half of what she pretended ? Did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog ? But in whatever state of mind Andy might have pictured Olympia Keith , he would have been certain to be wrong for , at almost that moment , as Miss Keith still basked in the sunlight on her flagstone terrace , the screen door opened and out came a plain-visaged young woman with a tape measure draped around her shoulders and in the front of her dress a long row of pins . " Miss Keith , " she said , " I 've let out the hems in both those print dresses and I 've pressed all the blouses . Is there anything more ? " Olympia Keith stirred lazily . " No , I do n't think so , Sarah . You 'd better have your lunch and go home . " However , as the girl put her hand on the door , Miss Keith called her back . " Oh , by the way , Sarah , you may be glad to know that I 've called off my war with Mrs. Hamilton . " Sarah 's honest face flushed . " You mean you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The saxophone ? " laughed Miss Keith . " No , I 'm not going to play any saxophone . As if I 'd know one end from the other . " " I 'm glad to hear that , Miss Keith , " replied the seamstress . " I hope you do n't mind my saying it , but the people here in West Cosset are really very nice when you get to know them . " Miss Keith nodded soothingly . " Yes , yes , Sarah , I 'm sure they are . " With a smile she also allowed her gaze to pass over the lake to where , on the opposite shore , a single big house stood alone among its trees . " I have an idea that find it much more agreeable from now on . " Again the girl put her hand on the door but again Miss Keith called her back . " Just one thing more , Sarah , " she added , suddenly . " Your sister  --  the Sergeant 's wife . Do you think that anyone else knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to me this morning ? " Sarah 's face became very grave . " Oh , no , Miss Keith , " she answered , solemnly . " Neither of us told anyone but you . "
