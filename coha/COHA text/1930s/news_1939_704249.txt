Having destroyed Poland , the German Chancellor was asking for a conference that would consecrate his conpests and organize peace on that basis . After the annexation of Austria and after his seizure of CzechoSlovakia he had used the same language , M. Daladier pointed out , saying that Germany had nothing more to claim .

What people would ever feel protected from , aggression if it appeared thus every six months , despite pledges against the annexation or partition of another people which had the right like itself to live independent and free ? " There could be no peace , he declared , until wrongs had been righted and human consciences satisfied . " They say , " he continued , " that the fate of Poland concerns only two powers . We reply that It interests also , and first of all , the Poles .

They were all aflame to fight Hitler and his armies for liberty and the Fatherland . Scorns " Great Patriots " " Yet , " he charged , " it sufficed for the Bolshevists to find it to their interest to agree with the Nazis and partition Poland with them for these same great patriots to simply.make their excuses for a peace of treason .
