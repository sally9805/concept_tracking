Ever since 1860 the U. S. has been almost entirely dependent on Europe for one very essential chemical : potash. * Last year the U. S. made history by producing 52% of its potash at home . Recently the annual report of the Bureau of Mines revealed that fact . Last week the consequences of it became apparent : Europe launched a potash war to recover the U. S. market . <P> Potash politics come easy to Europe 's masters of power politics . Europe 's Cartel is about two-thirds Potash Syndicate of Germany , some French , less Polish . Its bankers are British . Spain , an independent producer , thoroughly undercut the trust 's prices in 1933 and 1934 . But in the spring of 1935 the Syndicate , thanks to German control of Spain 's oldest potash company , made a tentative deal with Spain . Immediately the world price snapped back from its trade war low . <P> This deal was soon voided when Spain 's Republican Government nationalized the potash fields . Since Russian potash ( fully occupied feeding the soil of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cartel discipline , German and French potash magnates sniffed the rise of a rival Socialist combine . So did their London bankers and sales agents-J . Henry Schroder &; Co. -a firm which is an economic booster of the Rome-Berlin Axis . Franco 's victory ended their fears , brought Spain back into the potash axis . <P> Meanwhile , Schroder &; Co. had helped to form a company named Compensation Brokers , Ltd. , which gave Germany strategic raw materials on the cuff . Germany 's resultant debt served as an argument to push such German exports as potash in order to increase Germany 's ability to pay . Last year , however , was a poor year : Schroder &; Co. reportedly sold only $20,000,000 worth of the German Syndicate 's potash . <P> Last week the appeasement-minded potash interests of Europe 's democracies , and dictatorships , far from preparing for a war against one another , banded together more firmly than ever to keep the expanding U. S. potash industry from depriving them of the U. S. market . U. S. consumption in 1938 was 467,000 tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business , with the Cartel cut down to $13,512,110 . Down came the Syndicate 's U. S. price ( 50 to $1.75 a ton ) on three important grades . <P> Irony of the Syndicate 's sudden discovery that it had a real rival in the U. S. potash industry is the fact that U. S. production has been subsidized by no tariff . Had the foreign producers not set up monopoly prices , the U. S. industry might have grown more slowly , but the Cartel 's greed was all the " protection " that the infant industry needed . The Syndicate 's final stupidity was to maintain its prices during the 1938 depression . As a result its sales to the U. S. fell from 351,445 tons to 193,609 tons ( 45% ) , while sales of domestic potash expanded by 7% . <P> Last year , Potash Co. of America ( owned in Denver ) profited from the Syndicate 's attempt to rig the market , and doubled its plant capacity at Hobbs , N. Mex . Union Potash and Chemical Company , also of New Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big fertilizer company ) acquired three new leases to Government potash land , sped up shaft sinking to new deposits .
