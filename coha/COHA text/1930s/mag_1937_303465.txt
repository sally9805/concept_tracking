Since King George VI succeeded to the Imperial throne five months ago his political and medical advisers have been training him like a race horse so that he will be in top form May 12 . Last week on St. George 's Day , as a brief preliminary canter , His Majesty delivered the first formal public utterance of his reign ( 211 words ) . <P> Fifty thousand Britons and many U. S. visitors on hand for the Coronation bustled out to Windsor to gaze at the Royal Horse Guards in glistening breast plates and scarlet tunics , to cheer wildly as King George , Queen Elizabeth and most of the Royal Family wound out of the main gate of the Castle en route to a grassy slope nearby on the river Thames . <P> There in the bright sunshine loomed a simple fountain swathed in a Union Jack -a memorial to George V given by the inhabitants of England 's Windsor and Canada 's Windsor . Standing by it with bared head the King gave his address , an essay in modesty and propriety . Gist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will always bring the inspiration of a high example . " A cord was jerked , the Union Jack fluttered away , a cascade of water sprang from the fountain , a band blared the national anthem . <P> The show had been arranged with the greatest caution for fear the King might get stage fright , relapse into a stutter . <P> Only a few seats were allotted to the press , none to U. S. newshawks . There was no broadcast . Photographers were asked to withdraw . That night British press agencies gave out that " the company noticed only the slightest signs of hesitation in the King 's delivery . "
