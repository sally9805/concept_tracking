txt The Automobile Manufacturers Association has permanently severed its membership in the United States Chamber of Commerce , and joined the National Association of Manufacturers instead , in the belief that the latter group is more representative of manufacturing interests . Alfred ** vice president of the auto organization , explained the move here late Tuesday . He pointed out that the Chamber is made up of varying divisions , including such interests as insurance . The Automobile Manufacturers Association was a member of the Chamber from the time the latter was formed up until about a month ago when membership was allowed to lapse , Mr. Reeves said . Reports from Washington , headquarters of the Chamber , were that negotiations are being made to bring about restoration of the motormembership and that the resignation is not yet assured . Asked about this , Mr. Reeves said such action as that taken does not come about in the case of a big industry without careful consideration , and that he did not see much likelihood that the Association would rejoin . Asked about reports that connections were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor carrier legislation , Mr. Reeves said bus and truck men themselves sponsored such legislation , and that while the Automobile Manufacturers ' Association had at first opposed it , when its customers approved the opposition position was dropped . The belief was expressed in some quarters here that the move by the motor group might prove to be a precedent for like action by other strictly manufacturing groups , as periodically in the past the Chamber has been charged with representing trade and small business more than manufacturing .
