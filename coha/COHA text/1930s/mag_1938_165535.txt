For slaying Brazil 's famed , long-hunted bandit , Lampeao , " the Lamp Post " ( TIME , Aug. 8 ) , the police of Alagoas State last week received : 1 ) $5,000 ; 2 ) six freshly hacked human heads . <P> The $5,000 was a reward for the most recent killing of the Lamp Post , and its payment was proof enough to skeptical Brazilians that this time the Government believed him dead . The six heads were the grisly gift from the remaining members of the Lamp Post 's gang , and belonged to inhabitants of a remote interior settlement who were massacred and decapitated in retaliation for the Lamp Post 's death . One head was that of the aged grandfather of an Alagoas police lieutenant who led the attack on the bandit chief . <P> Last week Alagoas ' unfortunate police received word that the surviving bandits would burn every village in the countryside , massacre the inhabitants , send their heads to headquarters . The message came as a shock , for it was sent by " Corisco , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government has also killed several times .
