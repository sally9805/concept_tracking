Last week in eastern Texas men woke in the night with dreams of leases , drilling , sudden wealth . In Rusk and Gregg Counties heaven had broken loose . The oil boom which had burgeoned there ( TIME , Feb. 2 ) had budded and was flowering . <P> New wells by the hundred were going down ; several had struck into the precious pay sand but that was merely a portion of the excitement . All day airplanes droned overhead making aerial surveys of the lands where derricks were rising . All day geologists pored over samples cored out from the wells , gathering in groups arguing heatedly about the size and the formation of the field . Most of them thought that the oil sand was the eastern shore of a geologically forgotten sea . <P> Leases to oil rights passed from hand to hand at fabulous figures . A lease for 2.500 acres near the discovery well was reported to have been sold for $3,500,000 . Maps of the region , like crazy quilts , were marked with the names of lessors . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new oil field that they now enjoy . Men hugged themselves with the thought of owning a half , a 12th , a 20th interest in this property or that . <P> Other oil towns in Texas were almost deserted ; so many men had gone to the new field . In Longview in Gregg County , a town of 5,000 , the hotel and bank had builders busy hammering up buildings to double their available space . A project for an eight story office building to cost $400,000 was rushed to the ground-breaking point . An ice company prepared to establish a $50,000 factory , a dairy to build a $20,000 pasteurization plant . Carpenters worked all night rushing to completion a building to house the abstractors with their armies of stenographers . <P> At Henderson ( pop . 2,932 ) 15 mi. to the south , construction was afoot on two oil refineries ; four pipe lines had been already laid to the wells . Plans were drawn for a five-story hotel . Since the discovery of oil deposits in the two national banks had risen from $750,000 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Western Bell Telephone Co. and of Western Union were stringing new wires . Railroads were building new sidings to take care of booming traffic . Even tax collectors were not spared from work - back taxes were paid up at unprecedented rates . In the neighboring counties - for it is not known yet how far the field may extend-derricks were going up , leases and land titles changing hands . <P> On the spot oil was being sold for 40 a , bbl. down ( compared to prices 70 and up that have prevailed elsewhere in Texas ) . What may happen to oil prices , already depressed by overproduction , when the new field really comes into production , no one knows . How many million barrels might there be ? How much money would it not yield even at 40 a bbl. ? Why should eastern Texas care ? The Goddess of Fortune had stepped into her pool and once more laved her soft white limbs in oil .
