txt VICTORIES FOR HEALTH , EPICTETUS , himself a " lame old nan , " wrote a " hymn of thanks ; lying to " GOD who has given us ' hands , the power of swallowing , ' imperceptible growth and the pow ' er of breathing while we sleep . " 3ut man has lately done a great leal in cooperation with the Creator o lengthen the average period durg which he may continue to enjoy hose powers . This does not mean hat the former maximum span of ife has been lengthened , except perhaps in cases when the gentle nd skilled hand of nursing protects he flame that would otherwise have leen blown out by the gusts of Lature . It means only that more people live longer ; or , as stated in he summary of the report of a commission of the American Medical Lssociation and the National Eduation Association in yesterday 's ' IMES , the " average expectancy f life " has been lengthened twenty ears in this country in the last eventy-five years . This may be said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaintance with the laws , f nature and his preventive and ' rotective as well as curative medicaal efforts . What has been done in he conquest of diphtheria is espeially significant . In the last fifty ears the reduction in the mortality ate from this dread disease has been 5 per cent . It has been demontrated that it can be entirely elimiated if immunization is universally vailed of . The campaign carried on in this city has as its object complete immunization . When that is accomplished there are added thousands of children who may have an " expectancy " of fifty years of life . Typhoid fever has also been so far reduced in its ravages that the death rate . from it is less than . one-seventh of what it was thirty years ago . Here again complete elimination is dependent upon the use of established preventive means . In the report of the Milbank Foundation published today  --  a foundation which has made public health its major interest  --  one of the chapter heads is " Tuberculosis , a Preventable Disease . " In'the fight that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortality rate has been cut down by one-half in thirty years . Even the general death rate has been brought down in almost the same ratio during the same period . Most of this is due to what man has done through science , first in discovering the causes of specific diseases , and then in destroying them or protecting against them . There have been great victories , and no doubt the shadow of death will be pushed still further back by the researches and patient watchfulness and all but divine skill of those who have entered this battle for human welfare , and especially for those who have been lately invited by the older generation to take for their birthright , in ROBERT BRIDGES 'S phrase , as vast a heritage as their bodies have in " the immemorial riches of mortality . " The vastness of the heritage is not to be measured alone by the money values of health , though they are indicated by . the statistics of losses through ill health and shortened life , presented in the commission 's report .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
