txt Restoration of a more normal movement of railroad traffic as indicated by the contra-seasonal rise in loadings last week , together with indications that this year 's grain crop is now beginning to move in considerable volume , give promise of increased rail earnings and . equally important , of improving railroad credit . This year , it is believed , will be the first since the depression started when practically all crops will produce good yields . While rust damage has been reported in some parts of the country , most regions of the farm belt furnish prospects of good crops . As evidenced ? by loadings figures for the week ended August 3 there are strong possibilities in the very near future of a swing upward in loadings to a point where they will exceed a year ago . Not since the week ended June 15 have loadings topped comparable periods last year and there have been only two weeks since April 27 in which such gains were shown . Significant , too , from the railroad man 's standpoint , have been discussions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Fall , and also plans which are shaping for exchange of maturing issues . Not even preliminary preparations for new issues , it is believed , would have been undertaken unless confidence was felt by bankers that there was more than a mere possibility of better earnings . Industrial Activity Higher Loadings figures for last week were particularly encouraging , in that they showed increases in freight which depends on industrial activity . Miscellaneous freight , merchandise L. C. L. , forest products and coke all showed gains above the immediately preceding seven days . Coal traffic showed a sharp drop , but this commodity has moved in considerably greater tonnages in recent days because of the unsettled labor situation in this industry . The only commodity movement to drop sharply last week under the like 1934 period was livestock . At this time a year ago , the government was moving distressed cattle to feeding grounds . Most of this traffic was carried at emergency or land grant rates and the carriers claim they lost money on the shipments even though they swelled carloading figures . Earnings Improvement Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year are receiving the benefit of surcharges granted on some commodities , It is believed that August earnings will compare very favorably with a year ago . Also , on July 1 , last year , 2% To of the rail wage was restored and although the full 10% restoration is now in effect , management in recent months has demonstrated a better control over expenses , a fact which should also help to increase net operating income . That this year 's grain crop is beginning to move to market in some volume , is indicated by figures for last week , when grain and grain products loadings registered a gain of more than 1 000 cars over a year ago , while a gain of more than 8,000 cars was shown over the previous week . It is believed in some rail quarters that the slump in business which occurred in the latter half of 1934 is not as likely to happen this year : Miscellaneous freight , forest products , ore and coke are all recording increased shipments over last year . Executives also point to exceptionally good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in line with steel manufacturers , that further heavy shipments can be expected shortly to fill automobile manufacturers ' requirements for early introduction of the 1936 models . Longer pregie Anticipated Many of the carriers in 1934 had their peak weeks in carloadings in the latter part of July or early September , with practically no usual seasonal Fall peak. - Good crops and outlook for increased industrial activity this Fall and Winter probably will prolong the usual peak movement , not only aiding rail earnings thereby but also proving their salvation credit-wise . Some western carriers are already showing gains over 1934 . Increased loadings for July were reported by Great Northern , Northern Pacific , " Soo " Lines , Colorado &; Southern . Denver &; Rio Grande Western , Kansas City Southern and Cotton Belt . Great Northern 's gain was 6.8% while that for the Northern Pacific amounted to 15.6% . The betterment in Great Northern 's business will be of considerable aid to that carrier in handling its maturity of roughly $107,000,000 in bonds next year . These bonds carry a coupon of 7% . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely that at a low coupon rate the road would take steps to meet the 1936 maturity during the Fall when its business reaches peak proportions . Kenney on North West Crop Outlook In answer to a query from The Wall Street Journal , W. P. Kenney. president of the Great Northern , said that his road 's territory had probably " the best prospective crop in sight in her history three weeks ago . This has been reduced by various estimates from one-third to one-half . Threshing results in Montana are higher than expected and I would say that present estimates , carefully made , would show a little more than double last year 's crop Wheat is of lower milling grade . Coarse grain is in fine shape " The first pronounced sign of better business for eastern carriers is furnished in traffic of the Pittsburgh &; Lake Erie . This road reflects activity in the steel industry more than any other railroad . It handles large amounts of ore . coal and steel products . Gains over a : % ear ago have been shown as follows by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week ended August 3 16 l'e in the week ended July 27 ; 17.0% in week ended July 20 , 14.7 , - in week of July 13 and 4 , in seven days ended July 6 Improvement by the P. &; L. E. presages better business by other eastern carriers Pennsylvania Railroad , after a long period of declines . showed increases over last year for the final half of July . New York Central reported Increased loadings for the week ended August 3 after a series of weekly decreases from a year ago . Traffic Also Better in South Business has also improved in tin , South . The largest carrier in that section  --  Southern Railway ? reported for the last week August an increase of $335.000 in gross revenues over the like 1934 week The Southern needs additional revenues to meet obligations falling due between now and the early part of 1936. so that the present upward trend has added importance for that road . Canadian Pacific has begun to show better comparisons with last year . For the final week in July it reported an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bringing total revenues for the month to a point $412,000 over 1934 . This improvement reduced the decrease in gross for the first seven months to $273,000 compared with last year . The Canadian Pacific is planning the issuance of $50.000.000 in bonds Increased earnings and an improved credit standing will help to make them more readily marketable at a low interest rate . Crops in Canada promise to be much better than last year .
