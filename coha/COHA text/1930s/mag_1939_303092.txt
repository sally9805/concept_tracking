Anybody in the U. S. with a $1.98 racquet and a pair of sneakers can find a lawn tennis game in season . But the four indoor ball-and-racquet games-court tennis , racquets , squash racquets and squash tennis-are still the exclusive pastimes of folks on the sunnier side of the railroad tracks . In all the U. S. , for example , there are perhaps fewer than 500 persons who have ever taken a cut at a court tennis ball .

For the last 700 years it has been played with a lopsided , gut-strung racquet that looks as if it might have been left out in the rain .
