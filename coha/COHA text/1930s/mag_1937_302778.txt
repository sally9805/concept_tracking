Seven " favorites " in a field of about 20 mothers who crossed the finishing line in the Toronto " Stork Derby " four months ago , sighed with relief last week to know that their baby racing had not been in vain . The Ontario Court of Appeals declared valid the $500,000 bequest of eccentric Charles Vance Millar for the Toronto mother bearing most children during the ten years ending October 31 , 1936 . <P> That point settled , the Court then decided that illegitimate children should not be counted . This was bad news for Mrs. Pauline Mae Clarke , five of whose nine children were born after she separated from her husband . By no means abashed was Mrs. Clarke 's attorney , C. R. McKeown who warmly contends that the fact that Mrs. Clarke has been married at all makes a difference . Said he : " After all , the children were not born out of wedlock . ... I may appeal from the decision . " Mrs. Clarke was resigned , declared : " It was just a gamble anyway as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway and I have made a little money out of contracts through being in the race . " <P> The six other mothers in the running , one with eleven children , two of whom " may not have been properly registered , " and the rest with nine births apiece , were overjoyed . Mother-of-eleven Mrs. Martin Kenny exclaimed : " I ought to get all the money . " The others felt that the top-rankers should divide the fund . On one point all the mothers agreed : " It 's pretty near time the whole thing was settled . " <P> Final decision is up to a judge soon to be appointed by the Court of Appeals . His judgment will settle the baby race for good &; all .
