FRIENDS THROUGH THE NIGHT A STORY BY ARTHUR POUND W HEN the banks closed Friday afternoon , Powell Carr wondered if they would open next morning . Depositors in long queues had been besieging the savings banks ; to supply them the savings banks ran to the commercial banks , the commercial banks to the Federal Reserve bank . For days the New York gold reserve had been fading toward the legal limit ; how it stood at the moment no one but God and George Harrison of the Federal Reserve knew , and Harrison would not tell . By eleven o'clock that night Carr felt certain there would be a moratorium . The big bankers were in conference ; the Governor down from Albany to do the needful if the President would not act during his last doleful day in office . As the reports rolled in from his leg-men , Carr did a dozen things which would show on the face of the Express within the next two days . He called the chief to say that , in his opinion , Governor Lehman would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hand , but someone should be doing a leader for Sunday at the latest . He suggested the line to be taken  --  the good old Express line  --  America solid at the core , and all that . He suggested Bemis should write it . The chief agreed to everything ; he usually did . Before Bemis arrived , Carr told Sims to dig up the last Treasury reportof currency in circulation . He reminded Burtin to dig out of the morgue details of how the Clearing House handled its 1907 script issue . " Get someone to review the whole 1907 panic . " He vetoed a suggestion to feature interviews with New York bankers . Reason : all eyes would be on Washington for a while ; the financial capital of the country was shifting from New York to Washington . Bemis came in , excited . Carr always marveled how an excitable man like Bemis could write calm editorials . Bemis marveled how a calm man like Powell Carr could nurse such exciting ideas . " The Old Republic 's sunk , " said Carr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Uncle Sam . Note that these moratoriums are unconstitutional . Call attention to the ' redeemable in gold on demand ' pledges printed on the face of Treasury certificates . As tribunes of the people we ought to rub this repudiation home . Instead we are to say , Brother Bemis , that the nation is safe and the banks are safe and for everyone please to suffer in silence for a time in hope of better things . " " The banks , " declared Bemis , " are sound . At least the big ones are . " Bemis really believed in America , in banks , in everything . " Sure , " snorted Carr . " Because they 've taken it out of the little ones . There 's a taboo on banks in our American religion of success . Even when they 're closed , you ca n't razz the banks . When it comes to banks , newspaper men are just a bunch of trained seals . Take all these State banking holidays that have finally broken New York 's back . Not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in relief of bank directors and stockholders . Of course , the Governors all said they were closing the banks for the sake of the depositors ; the catch is that while the depositors ca n't get their money out , the directors and stockholders do n't have to put their double liability in , not just yet . There 'll be some inflation and the market will turn before they have to do that . " " I 'll whip out something for Sunday , " said Bemis . " Want to see the copy ? " " God , no ! I 'm going to Boston on the midnight . Flying back to-morrow in plenty of time to meet trouble halfway . Wish I did n't have to go , but I promised the wife . Everything 's in hand ; no chance to spread on the late editions , because of the Inauguration flood from Washington . What a day ! " " Memorable ! " said Bemis . " His-toric ! " " Curtains for an era , my boy . But as I was saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston to see Elsie . You know she 's there at school . Her mother 's worried about her ; thinks she 's too interested in some young squirt not good enough for her . I 'm supposed to kill off the romance . Nice job . I 'll try to edge out of it . " Carr called his house . " Darling , the heavens are falling . I 'm not going to Boston . Too much going on here . Serious ? You 'll know it 's serious when you order the groceries . How much money in the house ? Twelve dollars ! That 's a fortune ! " Mrs. Carr 's voice came back , clear , aristocratic , authoritative . " You must go to Boston , Powell , even if you 're there only an hour . Something will have to be done about this outrageous young Bolton . Lives at some filthy crossroads in Montana . You would n't want Elsie to live in Montana , would you ? " " No , " replied Carr , " I should n't . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love . Besides , I ca n't leave . " " She 's expecting you , " said Mrs. Carr . " And she 's short of money too . I know she has n't cashed her March check yet . " " I could send her a bill . " " But that would n't settle this ghastly Bolton affair , " said Mrs. Carr plaintively . " She says he has n't a cent  --  not a cent . Elsie will listen to you . She wo n't listen to me . Tell her she must finish her course . Get her to wait that long and it will blow over . Why , we do n't know a thing about him , He might be anybody or nobody . " " Young whippersnapper , " thought Carr , " thinks he can trap a girl like Elsie and drag her into the back country , to slave out her life over a cook-stove . " Still , he did n't quite see how he could get to Boston . He temporized : " I could write . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know that . If you do n't go , I 'll go . " Mrs. Carr 's voice could be fairly hard sometimes . It occurred to Carr suddenly that he would rather go to Boston than go home . " All right , " he said , " I 'll go . " " That 's a dear . And Powell  --  be sure to send me some more money before you start . Yes , by special delivery . You know I must pay the maids to-morrow . " " All right , " he said , shortly . " Good-by . " More money , always more money ! He pulled out his roll . Forty-five dollars . He shook his head . Money would be hard to get for a while . Never mind ; he 'd worm along somehow . Go on his face . No one would turn down the Express . He slipped twenty-five dollars into an envelope and gave his office boy instructions for mailing . " Taxi 's waiting , Mr. Carr , " said the lad . " You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on his way to the door when Burtin called to him . " Washington 's on the wire . Must talk to you . " The Washington Bureau wanted Carr to get the chief down there tomorrow . The new Secretary of the Treasury thought he might like to talk to a few big newspaper publishers right after the Inauguration . " He 'll be there , " snapped Carr . " Good-by . " Then he had to call the chief and arrange to have a plane ready for him . He could never make the train now . " Any other way to get to Boston to-night ? " " Bus leaves Eighth Avenue and ilst Street at one o'clock , " someone answered . " Only five blocks away . I 'll phone ' em to hold it a few minutes for you . Tough trip though . " " Never mind , " said Carr . " I 'm an old campaigner . " As his taxicab swung around the corner of Eighth Avenue , Carr turned and looked out of the rear window upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he always resented the Times 's calm assumption of the right to name the brightest corner of America . Fancy all this bright promise fading , as America sank in a bog of debt ! " Well , " he said to himself , " there 's one consolation . If this is the end of the Republic , Times Square will go dark long before the candles stop burning on the counters of the country stores . " They made a fast run to the bus station , to find a slim youth in uniform standing impatiently at the door of the humming leviathan of the highway . " Some bus , " said Carr , genially , aware that the way to a man 's heart is through his mount . The driver grinned . " Say , you got a nerve , holding us up like this . Hop on . " Carr settled himself into a seat on the aisle next to a woman in black who was looking out of the window , waving good-by to some friends . The driver shut off the lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hell , " said Carr to himself , " nine hours and nothing to do except look at the scenery . " Discovering that his legs were too long to fit the space allotted him , he decided he was in for a miserable night . Still why should he whimper ? With the world blowing up all round , this was n't so bad . At least he would have nine hours to himself . Oh , getting out five or six editions a day was n't so bad ; it was this infernal business of trying to steer public opinion in a cockeyed world . That got on a man 's nerves at last . What he should have been was a tramp . A tramp did n't have to worry about anything but himself . A tramp did n't have to sit round for three years watching a civilization die ; a tramp would miss the torture of thinking that something could be done to save the institutions Powell Carr had been brought up to revere and which , under his breezy cynicism , he still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could go tramping some day and never be missed . As the bus swung around the corner into Fifth Avenue , he felt the woman beside him , yielding to the momentum , swing toward him . " Close quarters , " he said , with a laugh . Their bodies were pressed together for a long moment , during which he decided that her profile , distinct against the bright street lights , was altogether admirable . Then the bus straightened away and she swung back toward the window . He studied her profile ; decided it was interesting but a little hard , like her arm . A good woman in hard training . Presently he said , " It 's going to be a long night . Let 's get acquainted . " She laughed softly , without looking at him . " All right . You might tell me where we are . " " On Fifth Avenue going north , " said Carr . " On the left is Central Park , where ten-cent men sleep under thousand-dollar trees . On the right are the homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the time . But they have to have their churches just the same . That 's the Church of the Heavenly Rest . " " A beautiful name , " said his companion . " My aunt in Marshfield she loved to sing a hymn about the heavenly rest the other side of Jordan . " Carr was delighted with her voice , with her accent . Not one person in ten thousand could pronounce " aunt " correctly ; he could n't himself ; none of his people could . But , then , that unnecessary " she . " Could it be that such a beautiful voice and accent could be entirely natural , and exist apart from grammar ? Presently he had more evidence that this could be true . In tones as sweet as an angel might have used in wheedling a weary soul toward heaven , his companion committed one grammatical sin after another . The effect at first was bizarre , disturbing , intoxicating . He leaned toward her to catch every word . This was something new . After the novelty wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them , the singular verb with plural noun , an occasional " of " for " have . " Here was another language , no less beautiful for being unstandardiz ' ed . In due course , as he drew out her story with the skilled touch of a master interviewer , he found the explanation of the mystery . She was born in " down east " Massachusetts , one of thirteen children of an English father and a New England mother who had died of her last child . Yes , she might be a Mayflower descendant on her mother 's side ; that did n't matter . She never thought of such things at all . She was one of the younger girls and had gone to work in the cotton mills at Fall River at the age of fourteen . Carr gasped . " At fourteen ! " " Well , " she said , " I was big for my age . I wanted to go into nursing , but my father he would n't hear to it . That was just a mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us away from hospitals . I think she meant because she was there so many times and dreaded it . But Father said no to nursing because of that , and I went into the mills . Then at seventeen I married and had two children by the time I was nineteen . One of my boys is in the Navy and one in the Army . It 's him I 've been down here seeing off to Panama . I could n't come except he sent me the money and asked to say good-by again . It seems like a waste in these times , but he wanted it so . " " Quite right , " said Carr , feeling that he was on the edge of realities compared to which banks and newspapers were tinsel . " But why both boys in the services ? " " It 's not what I 'd want , of course . They aimed to go to college , if they could work their way through . We thought we might help them a little till the work went slack . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't find a thing in Boston , or anywhere . They was just dawdling around , wasting their time , and they seen things would be harder for us if they was to stay home . No , I did n't try to stop them . The one in the Navy he thinks he can learn radio ; he 's always been wild about it . Tell me " ? she leaned toward him in the darkness ? " is there going to be war with Japan ? The neighbors say there 's going to be war . " Carr said " No , " half-heartedly . She sighed , and until then Powell Carr had never comprehended how eloquent a sigh can be . " I tell the neighbors , " she went on , " that if war 's coming no one can stop it , and they would be in it anyway , being just the right age . And in that case it 's better for them to go in trained than untrained . " Can studied her profile anew . Her words had given him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to himself , " that 's it ; she 's the Spartan mother . " Slowly , as they talked , Carr began to realize that he had never known any woman as well as he knew this woman . Perhaps it was the fact that they were , for all practical purposes , alone in a shadowy and uncertain world . The coach was in darkness , the world was in darkness except for the street lights of an occasional village , the driver was intent upon his task ; their fellow-passengers were asleep . This man and this woman might as well have been on a raft in mid-ocean . There need be no pretenses between them . Though he asked her a thousand questions , he was certain all of them would be answered . For this night she belonged to him and he belonged to her . He knew this before he had ever seen her face out of shadow . Soon the bus stopped in front of an eating house . All got out and drifted like ghosts in two directions  --  male ghosts one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he was having a cup of coffee and a cigarette , she reentered , came directly to his side and sat down without a trace of self-consciousness . No mistake about it : she was a handsome woman ; not evenher cheap black clothes , a little rusty from wear , could hide that . He had realized as much in their crowded seats . What he studied now , while she placed her order , were her face and hands . A resolute face  --  broad brow , straight nose , high cheekbones , determined chin , a mouth that smiled naturally , serious brown eyes , with an occasional sparkle of innocent coquetry in them , as if she found life rather good fun . A face , he saw , that had not been cold-creamed every night or carried often to the beauty parlor . Her brown skin looked hard , dry , tough . He thought of her as one who meets life head on day after day . Her hands fascinated him . Quick-moving , managing hands , given to delicate , decisive little gestures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her hands made no mistakes of grammar . They were poetry in action . Not pretty little lyric poetry  --  epic poetry . Large hands , working hands , firm-fleshed , and rosier than her face  --  hands that seemed full of blood to the finger tips . He was careful to take her hand when he helped her back into the bus and held it a little longer than necessary . A firm yet tender touch , compassionate . There was no vanity in this woman , he decided , but she had a just pride . She told him about their house  --  six rooms  --  larger than most in their neighborhood . She and her husband had saved their house painfully , putting by bit after bit for years . No , they had never owned an automobile , never had gone gadding around like so many . Except for a few short boat excursions each for a day only , she had taken but one trip in the twenty-three years of their married life . Once they had gone with some friends on a motor trip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed like a good deal of money , but they had been thrifty . Slept in a farm-house . Still , it had been a wonderful trip . She would have liked to stay in a hotel ; she had never been a guest in a good hotel in her whole life ; until this trip to New York , when her soldier son took her round , she had never ridden in a taxi . Yet the woman showed no trace of being sorry for herself . " My husband , " she said , " he is only a poor workingman but he has always done the best for me that he could . " Carr told himself that he must remember that . He was the sort of man who is always being told by women that their husbands do not understand them . The next time one of them tried that approach to his interest be would tell her about this woman . What was her name ? " Bertha Loomis , " she answered promptly , " but everyone calls me Bert . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they came that I 've been as much of a sister to them as a mother . " " My name 's Powell Carr . " He was afraid it might mean something to her . Better for them to be just man and woman to each other . He was relieved to find that his name did not register with her , though it was on the cover of several books . A man so well known seldom had a chance to talk to an intelligent woman who had no social " side " to maintain or who did not want something from him . There were plenty of things he wanted Bert to tell him . One thing in particular . " Bert , " he began , " you told me your husband has been out of work . I 've wondered what that would mean in a home . It must get on a man 's nerves , make him hard to live with , and all that . " " It does , terribly , " said Bert . " I 've had a time keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before this , but now he 's had almost no work for two years and he just do n't joke nomore . It do n't seem right to have him sitting around the house , puttering with this and that . We 're better off than most , for we had the house clear and some money in the savings bank when the trouble began ; but still it 's been bitter hard for Will . " The worst time I had with him was when my sister was there . We took her in when she lost ber job . One morning she had a letter she wanted posted and was nervous about it . So she called downstairs , ' Is n't Will ever going to work ? ' thinking he could take it on the way to the shop . He heard her and brooded on it all day . That night I said , ' Will , dear , what 's on your mind ? You 're not yourself . ' Then he told me . ' Here I 'm hungry for work , ' he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . And now she asks if I 'm ever going to work . ' It was dreadful hard to rally him . It took me half the night to get him to sleep . No one has any idea what being out of work means until it strikes home that way . " The moratorium forced itself back into Carr 's mind . " Suppose all the banks in the country should be closed to-morrow , Bert . Suppose you could n't get at this little nest-egg you have in the bank . What then ? " " Our bank wo n't close , " said Bert .. " It 's a good bank . Most banks are . " Carr smiled into the darkness and put his hand on her arm . " But if it should ? " " I do n't know just what we 'd do , " replied Bert , " but we would n't quit living . We 'd manage somehow . " " Yes , " said Carr , " I suppose we should . " It occurred to him , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moratorium . " All the same , " said Bert , apparently not noticing his hand on her arm , " I 'm glad I have n't a houseful of young ones to feed . " " I was wondering about that . I 'm a man who tries to understand things . I have n't met a woman like you for years , a woman who does n't try to hide anything . Here we are , cast together three hours ago as strangers , yet we seem to have known each other from the beginning of time . Except for chance we would never have met . It 's doubtful if we shall ever meet again . " Bert nodded . " Our lives are so different . " " What I mean is this , Bert . Between most men and most women there is a barrier  --  conventions , proprieties , this interest or that . Between us there is nothing except friendship . You ask nothing of me ; I ask nothing of you . You may have your weaknesses . I 'm not interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women that I do not understand . You might be able to help me understand them . " She laid her hand on his as if he had been a child . " I ca n't tell you about women , " she said . " I can tell you only about myself . I will do it as far as I can . If I talk too long , put your head on my shoulder and go to sleep . You are overwrought . I 'll talk to you , but do n't strain to listen . Let yourself sleep if you can . I do n't need no sleep . " You wonder , " she continued , in her voice of music , " why I 've only two children when I have had time to have a dozen . My boys came one on the heels of the other , almost . The doctor said I must n't have no more children until I was ready for them ; said it was murder for a woman to have thirteen children as my mother done , and die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waited ; there was other things to do and never too much money . " You remember what I said about wanting to be a nurse . Well , I 've drifted into it , going to the neighbors to help them when sickness comes , mostly on confinement cases , helpingwomen who are too poor to have anyone else . I 've never taken pay though , not a cent . Will he says it 's silly , but I look on my nursing as a gift and give it freely in return . I 've seen every sort of poverty , trouble , and death there is . That makes me look older than I am ; I 'm just forty . How old are you ? " " Forty-eight . " " You took older . I suppose it 's the life you 've led , worrying and all . But the years do n't count , do they ? It 's the spirit that matters . I 'm still twenty . " " And I 'm eighty , at least I was when I stepped on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please go on brushing the years away . " " Perhaps we 're disturbing some of these sleepers . " But none could have heard her melodious half-voice two feet away from its source . " Of course , " she continued , " if a woman asked me things , I told her what the old doctor had told me . I 've brought a good many babies into the world , but I 've kept more out of it . One thing I can tell you about women ; they 're downright ignorant on what concerns them most . Now you 've heard most everything I can say about that . If you 're not sleepy yet tell me about yourself . " Carr 's had been such a full life that he wondered where he should begin . Full of incident at least , if not of satisfactions . He told her of his early years of struggle and how he had wasted years in dead-end jobs with no future in them . She was curious about what she called " big people , " and he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly dull , " he said . " They get that way from riding the cushions through life . You are more interesting  --  you know what life is . " " No , " she said , " no one does . I know what death and birth are , but I do n't know what life is , except that it is a terrible muddle in which you just go along . " Carr poured out his soul to her . The country , he said , had gone cuckoo . An era was decaying and its manhood likewise . He said he had decayed , himself , and could no longer speak the truth . No man of his acquaintance , he said , seemed to have himself in hand spiritually . The leaders were in a fog and , with the best intentions in the world , were destroying their people . " Destroying your husband , " he said bitterly , " and you . " Then it occurred to him this was absurd . Nothing could destroy this woman named Bert . She took up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you my thoughts , but perhaps I ca n't . I 've never done it . I do n't know that I can find the words . It is a fact , but I 'm not bragging about it , that I have been true to myhusband . Sometimes it has been a burden on me to say ' No ' to other men , for it is my nature to give . Still , marriage is a contract , and I have kept my end of it . Sometimes I wonder what would of happened if I had married someone else  --  someone more fortunate . " " In that case , " said Carr , " you would not be quite the superb woman you are now . " " Do n't talk compliments . Ca n't you see I 'm trying to tell you something I 've never spoken aloud before ? Yours is a broad life ; mine 's a narrow one . Oh , yes , it is . Yet here we are as cozy as two pigeons in a nest . Why ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were meant to love one another ? I do n't mean in the flesh but as comrades . Men get more chance that way than women ; but I 've had some of it through my nursing . See ? " " Dimly , " said Carr . " Anyway , " said Bert , " here we are . You are a good man ; I am a good woman . I 'll likely never see you again but I 'll not forget you . I 'll forget what you looked like but I 'll rememberthings you say .. When I need courage I 'll remember you said I 'd a strong soul . I love you as God , maybe , would love his children if he knew them better . I ca n't help it . It is part of me . I meet few men of my own age or near it , but when I do meet a new one I wonder could I be happy with him for a husband . And the answer is most always , ' Yes , I could be happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere , with anyone . You say everything 's going to glory . Go to sleep and forget it . Even if everything does go to smash , it could be put together again . " " I 'm not so sure about that , " said Carr , drowsily , " but I do feel sleepy . Will you kiss me ? " She turned and kissed him lightly , tenderly , and caressed his forehead with her fingertips . " Poor boy , " she said . " So little faith . " When he woke it was broad daylight . The car stopped half an hour for breakfast . They had time to walk a few blocks of wind-blown street in Worcester . As the wind whipped her garments around her full , strong figure , he could think only of the Winged Victory . The spell of the night had gone , and with its passing their talk turned outwards . He told her of his daughter , of his plans for her , of her talent and the disturbance created by young Bolton . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looked upon his concern as rather petty . He felt distinctly that way himself over her anxiety lest she would miss the connecting bus for her home city . He heard with a sinking heart that there would be only a fifteen-minute wait between their arrival and her departure . It was inconceivable to him that they could part this way , without at least one more moment entirely to themselves . Instead of alighting at his hotel , he rode down to the terminal with her . " See here , " he said , as they stood in the crowded station , " I ca n't say good-by like this . Wait over until the next bus . Have breakfast with me and ? " She looked up at him smiling . " You need n't say no more . I know what would happen . Maybe I 'd like to do it . I might if I thought you really needed me -- -that way . But right now I must go along home and get my husband 's dinner . He needs me more than you need me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ? " " Give me your telephone number . " " There 's no ' phone , " she said , " and never has been . And I 'm not going to give you my address . You might write or telegraph , and that would bother Will . Of course I 'd pay no attention to it . This is good-by , is n't it ? But remember what I said about not forgetting , never . " Two hours later , Elsie joined her father at the hotel . " It must have been a hard trip , " said Elsie , " but you 're looking top . " " Yes , my dear . It was an experience . I would n't have missed it for worlds . Now , about this young Bolton . Do you think it 's the real thing ? " Elsie nodded , as if something in her throat kept her from speaking . Then she swallowed hard and said , " But it all looks sort of hopeless . He has n't any money . He 's working his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get married . " " Nonsense , " replied her father tartly . " If you love him enough to bear with any misfortunes that come along ; if you 're dead sure you love him that way , look him over . If he 's solid , go ahead and get married the day after his school closes , and you can hitch-hike back to Montana with him for all I care . I 'll take your word for it that he 's white , honest , and not too ugly . " " Bob 's beautiful , " said Elsie , " inside and out . " Carr laughed . " Good girl . Then get him over here as soon as you can so I can size him up my own way . Ask him to run over for an early lunch . " While his daughter was telephoning he went downstairs to cash a check . " Sorry , Mr. Carr . Orders are to cash no checks . We 'll mail your bill to you . Lend you money if you need it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sounds crazy . " " The idea is we 'd rather trust you than the banks . " " All right . Give me twenty . Now I know you 're crazy . My bank is ten thousand times more solvent than I am . Thanks , so long . " Young Bolton came over on the run . Plenty of bone and muscle ; but how was his grit ? Was he the kind that would see things through ? Carr concluded he was , from the way he carried his head . Steady eyes , straight back ; nothing flashy . Was he a man who could come to the point ? To see if Bolton could come to the point , Carr sent Elsie to telephone the airport . Yes , Bo/ton could come to the point : " I 'd like to marry Elsie , Mr. Carr . I 'll tell you all I can about myself and my prospects and people , and where you can write to check me up . " Mr. Carr brushed all that aside . " Of course . Quite proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a father should . But I think you 'll do . The point is : no matter what comes , do the best you can for your wife , whoever she is . That 's what counts . " " Yes , sir , " said young Bolton , soberly , " that 's what counts . " When Elsie returned she thought they both looked a little uncomfortable ; so she sent Bob for some cigarettes . " Now , Dad ? " she demanded with a catch in her voice . " I 'm going home to report to your ON THE FLYLEAF OF SHAKESPEARE 'S SONNETS 179 mother that Bolton is accepted on probation , pending reports . Formalities . Just between ourselves , I think you 're a lucky young woman . " Elsie kissed her father , tearfully , joyfully . " I might not have been so pliable yesterday , " continued Carr . " You do n't realize it , but you have a new father , born last night . I can see it must be a terrible thing to be out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good wife , if you run him into debt or trouble , I 'll fly to Montana and give you the spanking of your life . Here 's some money . " Elsie shook the tears out of her eyes and laughed . " I 'll show you I can stick too . But how about thisbank thing , Dad ? Is it as bad as it sounds ? " " Not half as bad . There are reserves the bankers could n't get hold of ? and I do n't mean reserves of money . " Elsie nodded . Then her brow clouded . " Mother will be terribly disappointed . She wanted so to have me make a big match . Please try to make her see how wonderful Bob is . " " I 'll try . How shall I put it  --  that guts are more than coronets ? " Back on the job , Carr read Bemis 's editorial and called its author . " That 's good stuff . Give ' em another Iike it to-morrow . Do you know what I think ?

How long , how long I deemed it an excess To read the words that burst the sayer 's soul ! How brief the day since I have been made whole With health to know all words are niggardliness ! I am made whole that knew not I was ill ; I have been hale whatever ill may come ; Articulate that knew not I was dumb ; I have been warm that knew not I was chill . Oh dearer thou than none can know but me , My fettered words , my unshackled heart to thee !
