For Norwegian whalers , Norsk Telefunken Radioaktieselskap last week turned up a neat new wrinkle : a battery-powered radio transmitter sealed in a steel drum attached to a lance which is hooked to the floating carcass after a whale has been killed by harpooners in small boats . It will broadcast on the 600-to-800-metre band an automatically recurring signal so that a mother ship with a direction-finding receiver can track down and recover the catch . Since few household radio receivers tune much higher than 560 metres , the chances of an ordinary radio listener tuning in a dead whale will be slight . <P> This week , weather permitting , the U. S. Bureau of Lighthouses planned to test a set of similar radio buoys in Boston Harbor as channel markers for harbor pilots steering through fog .
