In 1899 , 13-year-old John Frost Winchester went to work as an apprentice machinist in Peabody , Mass . Presently Jack Winchester became one of the first students in a Boston Y. M. C. A. automotive school . He worked on the first automobiles to reach the U. S. from abroad , learned to drive a " steamer , " helped devise the first self-starter . In 1913 he landed a job as sales engineer for Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey . Standard now operates 12,000 trucks and 4,000 cars , second largest fleet in the U. S.* Jack Winchester is manager of the lot . He is also president of the New Jersey Motor Truck Association , vice president of the American Trucking Association . Three years ago , Truckman Winchester conceived the idea of a national truck show , got Standard Oil and several truck makers to sponsor the first one in a Newark armory . Last week , as automobilemen prepared for their 1936 Automobile Show across the river in Manhattan ( see p. 93 ) , held in Newark under Jack Winchester 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Show . <P> The Truck Show is held in Newark because Newark is the nation 's greatest highway freight centre , because Jack Winchester wants it there and because Newark 's vast municipal Center Market Building can be rented cheap . On its two dank floors last week gleamed and glistened a collection of trucks , bodies , trailers , engines and accessories from 60 leading U. S. manufacturers . As in the Automobile Show , the exhibits included gadgets , displays , sections of engines , cinema demonstrations . Unlike the Automobile Show , the Truck Show 's exhibits were aimed not at the general public but at the comparative few whose business it is to move freight over the roads . <P> The last words in trucks this year are streamlining , lightness , safety and C. O. E. ( cab over engine ) . By compressing the front of a truck so the driver sits directly over the engine , the maker gains numerous advantages : 1 ) better teardrop streamlining ; 2 ) equal freight capacity with considerably shorter wheelbase , which makes driving and parking easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front wheels carry as much weight as the rear wheels . Practically all truck makers have plumped for C. O. E. Profiting by the experience of automobile makers who rushed too fast into streamlining , most truck makers have adopted it only in modified form . Modern trucks move fast enough to make streamlining worth while . But it has one detriment-curved body corners cut down space within . <P> Some old-fashioned truck tractors and their trailers weigh ten tons unloaded , 40 loaded . To reduce vehicle weight , trailer makers are experimenting with the new Pullman technique of incorporating the frame in the body . As for safety , truck makers now claim that the driver alone can be improved .
