txt The defense in the Haden labor trial concluded its first week in court with a strenuous effoit to extricate a former deputy sheriff , one of 40 individual defendants , from the shadow of prison bars . The entire day yesterday was devoted to the succor of Lon E. Ball , who established something of a record for the number of denials he recorded against all and sundry accusations which the Government had piled up against his particular person . And he was backed up In his vai ious denials by one of his former employers , two men who went rid . ing with him " Just to go riding " on the clay of labor 's first big laity in Harlan , in recent years , a miner who tried to clear him of I a suspicion of shooting bullets at a I labor organizer and wife , and a 13- ' year-old boy who said that it was n't ' Lonnie " who struck the first blow in an altercation with a union striker who speedily thereafter landed in Jail . But " Lonnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contention of virtue . At one time he entered a heated denial before his examiner had even named the charge he was asking him about . At another time he denied he packed his gun with him when he went " riding " past the union rally at Evarts , when he had not many minutes before testified that he did have his gun on that occasion , Surprised at Inference And the final blow fell on " Lonnie " when he expressed complete surprise that the prosecution should consider it significant or strange that he was one of 13 deputy sheuffs who iegistered at the Lewallen Hotel in Harlan the day that eight union orgamzeis had inet 1-ously registered them . He said he had come down to the hotel " because my family was away that night , " and denied emphatically that he had been ordered there by Sheriff Theodore Middleton . What the jury did not hear , but presumably will before the trial is over , is that Sheriff Middleton testified in this count in another trial in which he was a defendant on a charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheriffs there to protect , he said , the union organizers against the resentment of Harlan citizens resulting from the " Battle of Everts . " The day when the names of the eight organizers headed the hotel registry page and were followed directly by the names of the 13 deputies was Dec. 8 , 1934 . The " Battle of Evarts " took place in May , 1931 . Following the registration State Troops were sent into Harlan in order , the Government contends , to rescue the labor organizers . But " Lonnie " knew nothing of this . He had , he said , recognized one or two other deputies at the hotel that night . But he said he had n't known any labor organizers wele there , nor that they were being watched or " Protected . " Two Basle contentions " Lonnie 's " day in court came after a full week during which the defense has laid the groundwork for two contentions basic to its case against the Federal Government 's charge of criminal conspiracy to fled , never even discussed the subject the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harlan County coal operators , the defense has established the argument that whatever deputy sheriffs may have done in the nature of anti-union intimidation or violence was done without the knowledge of the coal operators themselves who , all five have testified , never even discuss ( ' the subject of unionism or expressed any antiunion sentiments in the meetings of the Harlan County Coal Operators Association . Particular care has been taken to emphasize the contention that deputy sheriffs , if they ever went night-riding outside the limits of the mining camps they were hired to police , did so quite on their own responsibility and that no blame for their extra-curricular activities can attach to the operators . Second , they have laid the groundwork for their contention that whatever violence may have occurred in Harlan ( and of course they deny that there Was ever any connection between known incidents of violence and labor-employe ? relations ) , began at the hands of labor organizers , From this follows the further argument that if violence occurred it was an expression of resentment by individuals against union organizers or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many Witness Yet Unheard This is the picture which will be filled in in detail during coming weeks as the defense puts all or most of the 18 operators and 22 former deputy sheriffs still on trial , end with them probably nearly 200 sustaining witnesses , on the stand to establish individual innocence and the absence of a general conspiracy . The process is likely to go on for another month or more . Defense attorneys have been tacitly promised at least as much time as ' the prosecution took to plc-sent , its charges . This would mean three more weeks for defense testimony alone . After that the Government is expected to consume another week in rebuttals . When Mr. Ball 's turn came to take the stand he was tinder the shadow of a long list of Government charges , most impottant of which was that on July 17 , 1935 , when a big labor rally was held at Everts to celebrate passage of the Wagner Act , he was one of a group of deputy sheriffs who blocked the highway , interrupted speakers by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rifle in his hands and placed himself behind a " sycamore tree " where he stood with his gun pointed in the general direction of the crowd of miners . According to the witness and two others who testified to having been in his car with him that day , the truth was quite otherwise . All three insisted that they did not even know that any union meeting was scheduled that day . They denied they had noticed any of the union circulars or placards which according to Government witnesses virtually covered the Harlan landscape for two days previous to the rally . Just Going for a Ride Continuing their story , they said they had just decided to go for a ride to Harlan . On the way back to their camp they noticed a crowd down a side load and went to investigate . Arriving at the scene , they found the road blocked by a truck which caused them to stop and " Lonnie " to admit that he did blow his horn a little . Then they got by , turned around a bit tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went quietly home . " Lonnie " and his two supporters all insisted that he did not have any " long gun " in the car , did not get out and stand behind the " sycamore tree , " did not , in fact , do anything whatever to interfere with the union " speakin ' . " Another charge against " Lonnie " was that he was in a car which ailed Marshall Musick and his wife on Jan. 31 , 1937 , shortly before shots hit the ground around the pair as they were Walking along a railroad hack. and was also in the vicinity when these shots were fired , as the Government contends , from the road . Reply of the Defense Against this contention the defense offered two witnesses who said they saw the shooting ; that the fir- ing was done from the hillside far above the highway ; that shortly before they had seen two men , one carrying a " long gun , " go up a trail which led in the direction of the place whence the shots were fired ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the place where they had seen the smoke of firing . But neither was able to identify either of the two men who went up the hillside trail . Other charges against Mr. Bill concerned an alleged driving of union organizers off the property of one of the two mining camps which he policed , and a dispute with a striker at another . A 13-yea ? - old boy who witnessed the latter incident said he had seen the miner strike at Mr ! Ball , and had not seen " Lonnie ' , strike back . " Lonnie " had testified he did strike back , The incident of the hotel register was the climax of two hours of severe cross-examination by the prosecution and apparently took the witness entirely by surprise . It ended with a question whether he denied knowing anything about an order by the sheriff to go there to " protect " the union organizers , to which he replied : " Yes , I do . " The defense examined him again briefly on other matters , but said nothing whatever about the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
