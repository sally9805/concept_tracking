With old age pensions looming ever larger as a factor in Depression politics , observers were not surprised last week to see a deal consummated in politically sophisticated Massachusetts between one of the major parties and a local politician who had rounded up the Townsend Plan vote . " Buyer " was the Republican candidate for Governor , blue-blooded Leverett Saltonstall . " Seller " was William H. McMasters , 64 , of Cambridge , who looks something like old Dr. Francis E. Townsend . Published " price " : a promise in Mr. Saltonstall 's platform to make " an earnest effort to have this bill Townsend General Welfare Act* brought before Congress at the earliest possible moment . " Though the Townsend Plan is officially cold-shouldered by the Administration . <P> New Dealers as far separated geographically as Florida 's Senator Pepper and Oklahoma 's Senator Thomas have taken off their hats to it in their primary campaigns . But realistic Republicans have been the most alert in reaching for the ready-made local blocks of votes which have been quietly assembled by Townsend National Recovery Plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President L. Wallace Jeffery of T. N. R. P. in offices occupying one whole floor of a big lakeside building , has checked the 1.000 or so candidates standing for the 435 House seats and 32 Senate vacancies . Mr. Jeffery , assisted by Dr. Townsend 's dark-haired young son Robert as secretary-treasurer , has found only 155 Congressional candidates worthy of T. N. R. P. endorsement. + About two-thirds of them are Republicans , including the three incumbents already re-elected in Maine and Senator Gerald P. ( " Neutrality " ) Nye of North Dakota . <P> A by-product of this trend is Candidate McMasters who polled 48,000 votes in Massachusetts ' Republican primary for Governor , although he did not have the official Townsend accolade . Nor was his deal with Candidate Saltonstall the brainchild , as many observers guessed , of shrewd young Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr . It was engineered by an opportunist even shrewder : William Henry McMasters . <P> This gentleman has dazzled Massachusetts with his virtuosity ever since the days of Charles Ponzi , the sleight-of-hand banker whose blow-up rocked Boston 18 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the blow-up came , the Boston Post scooped the story . Its informant : Pressagent McMasters.
