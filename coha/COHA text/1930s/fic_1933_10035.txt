perary ' and the Doxology and Where Do We Go From Here ? ' and Onward , Christian Soldiers . ' Sally 's father said that the unbridled release of emotion made the false celebration seem no more than a rehearsal . Sally returned with the family to Lakewood at nightfall , exhausted by the crowds . She could with difficulty believe that the era of peace was at hand . A letter from Alan was awaiting her on the hall table . It was ten days old , but it put the finishing touch to her happiness . Alan had sat out in the hospital garden . He would soon be able to report to his regiment . Well , he wo n't have to do that now , ' said Sally . Why not ? ' asked her father . Sally looked at him in surprise . If the war was over surely all the boys had to do was to catch the first boat for home . Her father explained that the Expeditionary Force was still on active duty . That the Germans must evacuate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her turn , might perhaps be occupied until the peace treaties were signed . That more than three and a half million Americans were in uniform and that more than two million of them were in Europe . That the mere routine work of demobilization might take several months . Months ! ' cried Sally . Why , how perfectly outrageous ! I should think , now we 've won the war for them , those nations over there could clean up their own countries . It was all their mess in the first place ! ' Sally 's father expressed a little doubt whether America had really won the war . He said we owed our Allies all the help we could give them . Sally professed a complete indifference to what was going on in Europe . I believe in the Monroe Doctrine , ' she said firmly . I hope we never get mixed up with them again . At any rate , we 're through with them now . ' Her mother , on the contrary , for the first time since the United States had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could about the state of things abroad . It 's the greatest opportunity since the Napoleonic Wars , ' P20Ishe said , to make a just peace .

" It will now be our fortunate duty to assist by example , by sober , friendly counsel , and by material aid the establishment of just democracy throughout the world . " I think that 's splendid , ' she said . It really seems as if this might be the last war . He 's a very great leader . ' But Sally only wanted to have Alan come home . She cared less than nothing about the establishment of just democracy . She said so , with feeling , from the vantage-point of the staircase , on going up to bed . She added that she was not even sure what it meant and that she had no idea how it could be established . Her mother , on the landing above her , shook her head at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his finger on the electric light button at the foot of the stairs , laughed heartily . At that , Sally , ' he said humorously , you need n't feel very inferior . You 're in the same boat with most of the more intelligent statesmen . ' Seven days later , Sally was standing by her father 's armchairin the Lakewood library , arranging an armful of autumn oak leaves in the pottery bowl on the table . She had just come in from walking in the November woods . The woods had been wet and the skies grey , but the fresh , damp air had brought colour to Sally 's cheeks . The oak sprays still held the scent of the woodland paths  --  a faint , penetrating odour of wet bark and damp earth and dead leaves , the odour of the blanket beneath which the flowers of spring would sleep . Sally was thinking of those flowers as she arranged the oak leaves  --  hepaticas , spring beauties and trillia , violets , wild geranium and May apples . In April they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be home . They would walk together on Saturday and Sunday afternoons under a spring sky and pick the flowers and bring them home to decorate the library , as she was decorating it now with the wine-red foliage of autumn.  | Suddenly Sally heard the sound of a motor on the driveway . Glancing out of the front window to see who might be coming to call , she was surprised to observe that the motor was a taxi . Callers in Lakewood never used taxis . No one used them , except for an occasional evening party when a chauffeur had his night off duty , or for a trip from the station when , through some slip , a car had failed to meet the train . Some itinerant pedlar , she thought indifferently  --  a young man selling magazine subscriptions or a reduced gentlewoman showing Armenian lace . Carl never permitted a pedlar to cross even the threshold of the vestibule , unless her mother were within hearing .

Sally backed away from the table to admire her handiwork . The oak leaves were lovely in the pottery bowl . She must pick some for Granny , she was thinking , and take them in town to the house on Cass Street where Granny was established for the winter , when she heard the sound of a latchkey in the front door . Her father ? Sally glanced at the clock . The hands stood at ten minutes to four . He was probably coming home early today , as he so often did , for a quiet hour or two with his pictures before dinner . The front door opened and she heard his step in the hall . Daddy ? ' she called . Then , as he did not answer , That you , Daddy ? ' Still there was no reply . Sally 's father always enteredhis front hall with the questioning call of Eve ? ' to her mother . Sally walked to the library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat and overcoat which he had dropped on the hall sofa , to take a newspaper out of the overcoat pocket . The newspaper was crumpled and untidily folded . Sally noticed it because her father read a newspaper neatly . He did everything neatly . Slowly he stood erect . He turned to face her . As he did so , Sally was conscious of a great sense of shock . Her father 's face was shocking . It was grey and haggard . His hands which held the roll of newspaper were trembling  |p203Daddy  ! ' Sally cried in alarm . Daddy - you 're not well ! ' Her father did not reply . As he walked slowly toward her , Sally saw that his feet were shuffling slightly , giving to his usually brisk step a curious illusion of age . She ran toward him . She seized his arm . She was frightened . A stroke , she was thinking wildly ? An accident ? Then her father spoke . Where 's your mother ? ' he said . She 's out . She 's at Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patted her hand , vaguely , but reassuringly , He walked past her into the library . Sally followed him , talking eagerly . Let me send for her . I 'll telephone . ' Sally 's father shook his head . No . Do n't telephone . ' Sally 's hand was on his arm again . Sit down , Daddy , ' she said . Let me get you something . Water ? There 's brandy ' Sally 's father looked at her . No . I 'm all right , Sally , ' he said . He smiled faintly . That smile brought reassurance . Sally smiled herself . You do n't look all right . You scared me , Daddy . What happened to you ? ' His eyes wavered under her encouraging gaze . He glanced , unseeingly , around the quiet room . Then turned to her again . Sally , ' he said , I do n't know how to tell you . You must prepare for a great shock . ' Sally 's hands flew to her beating heart . That heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 0 God ! she was thinking  --  Alan ! Her father 's voice was going steadily on . My child , I wish I could help you  --  but for some things there is no help . ' His hands were fumbling again with the newspaper . Sally clutched them in her own . Tell me , Daddy ! ' she demanded . Tell me ! ' He looked gravely at her for a minute in silence . Then , Sam is dead , ' he said . Sally 's hands fell to her sides . She stared up at him stupidly . Sam ? ' she said . She was conscious of a wrench that waspositively physical as she adjusted her thoughts to his words.  |p204As  she forgot Alan . Sam ? Oh , Daddy  --  it  --  it 's not pos-sible . ' It 's true , ' said her father simply . It ca n't be , ' said Sally . Why  --  the war 's over . The Eighty-Sixth never went into action . ' No , ' said her father dully . But see He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Her own hands were shaking . Her eyes ran unseeingly over its crumpled columns of print . I ca n't  --  I ca n't ' she stammered . There , ' said her father . He was pointing to a three-inch paragraph , halfway down a column on the front page . The print was blurred with handling , but the little headlines stood out clearly . SAMUEL SEWALL III DIES IN FRANCE . BANKER 'S SON SUCCUMBS TO MENINGITIS IN BORDEAUX HOSPITAL '  --  The paper dropped from Sally 's hands . It 's not true , ' she said . It is true , Sally . I called up the War Department . ' Oh , Daddy  --  it  --  it ca n't be ! ' Her eyes were pleading with his . You know  --  they  --  make mistakes . ' Her father shook his head . I read it in this paper , ' he said slowly , when I was lunching at the Chicago Club . I bought it at the door , for I was lunching alone . I read it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . I went out to a telephone booth and called up the Evening Post . I got the city editor . He said the report had come through from Paris . He said they 'd tried to get me at the bank . I was out all morning  --  at a board meeting . They 'd called your mother here . But she was out . Fortunately . He seemed quite certain that it was true . It was in the Paris Herald . But still I did n't believe it . I got the War Department in Washington , then . They were very kind , but it took some time to have the records traced . And finally they called me back and said that  --  that it was so . That Sam was dead . A letter was on the way . Official notification . They said they were sorry the papers got it first . They said it often happened when a man  --  a man died who was of  --  local importance.  |p205Local  importance ! ' Horace Sewall 's voice was bitter . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was all true  --  what 's in that paragraph . He came down with meningitis ten days before the armistice . They took him to a hospital in Bordeaux . He died there three days later . The Paris papers got it in the casualty list , I suppose , just when the cables were crowded with news of the armistice . The publicationwas delayed . It was in the Paris Herald yesterday  --  the Post man told me that . It had just been reported officially to Washington . They did n't know yet where he was buried . ' Sally 's eyes , dark with horror , were on her father 's face . Daddy , ' she said , I still do n't believe it . Alan would have known . Alan would have cabled . ' Then she remembered that Alan , when last heard from , had been in the hospital at Neuilly . Her frantic mind searched hurriedly for further cause for disbelief . Uncle Fred , Daddy ?

We 'll hear from Fred and Alan when they know . We ought to cable them . ' Horace Sewall sighed wearily . His sigh accepted the situation . Sally looked at him tenderly . Daddy , darling , ' she said , I do n't see how you could bear it . Was anyone there to help you ? ' Her father shook his head . The club was full of men I knew , but I did n't want to talk to them . I sat in the telephone booth , waiting for the Washingtoncall . It came through quickly . Later I just went on sitting there , while they looked up the records . It must have taken them about three quarters of an hour . I do n't know exactly . I caught the three o'clock train . I took a taxi from the club to the station . It 's a strange death .

She thought of him , feeling queer in camp , talking to a doctor in khaki , taking to his cot , lying in an ambulance , stretched on a hospital bed , in pain , in anxiety , listening to strange voices , cared for by strange hands , dying  --  and then , dead . Dead and buried . Strangers burying Sam . Her father spoke again . His voice was dull and colourless . Someone ought to call up Alan MacLeod . And Cora and Lambert  --  before they see the paper . George must go up from the Loop and break it to Granny . We must telephone Mathilda to keep the Post away from her . We must do that now . ' He glanced at the clock . Sally 's eyes followed his . The hands stood at five minutes after four . Fifteen minutes only , since she had heard his latchkey in the front door . Fifteen minutes to change the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were staring at an inner vision of Granny 's brownstonedoorstep , dark and damp in the moist November air , with a folded copy of the Chicago Evening Post lying where the newsboy had flung it on the pale tan doormat  --  at a vision of Mathilda 's plump , more than middle-aged figure in black dress and white apron , emerging from the front door and stooping , a little awkwardly and very indifferently , to pick up the newspaper , not knowing it to be an engine of destruction . I 'll telephone Mathilda , ' she said . Then she looked at her father . The fearful , unspoken thought that had been hovering in her consciousness from the moment that her father had said the words , Sam is dead , ' rose to her lips . Daddy  --  Mother A quiver of pain passed over her father 's face . Yes , Sally . Do n't send for her . ' Do n't send for her ? ' No . She 'll come home soon enough . Too soon . ' Sally understood . She walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs . She wondered , dryeyed , why she was not crying . She called up Mathilda . She hushed her exclamation of horror . She explained the situation and heard Mathilda take command of it , with eager reassurance . Mathilda was kindly , Mathilda was competent . She had been twenty-three years in Granny 's service . Sally returned to the library door.  |p207Will  you call Uncle George , or shall I ? ' she asked . Her father did not answer . He had picked up the newspaper from the rug where she had dropped it and was holding it once more in his hands . Sally suddenly divined that that little laconic paragraph , brutal in its brevity , seemed to him a last message from Sam . He was standing with his back to the room , looking out over his stretch of brown November lawn to the hedge of rosebushes and across it up the slope of Aunt Cora 's lawn to her white-porticoed door . Sally walked over to him and slipped her hand through his elbow . She laid her cheek lovingly against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long enough to be conscious that the autumn twilight was falling . The light from the overcast sky grew greyer . Dusk gathered in the oak copse that sheltered the lawn from the road . A window was suddenly illuminated in the upper floor of Aunt Cora 's house . Sally was looking at the pine tree which she and Sam had climbed together when they were children . She was thinking of the tree house they had built in its upper branches . Suddenly her mother 's figure appeared on Aunt Cora 's doorstep . She stood there for a moment , clearly outlined against the white of the columns , looking back and calling something gaily to someone , not visible , in the front door . Then she turned and ran down the steps and sauntered casually , gracefully , across Aunt Cora 's lawn . As she passed through the rose arch she paused to pick a spray of the trailing bramble . Some rose leaves were clinging to it  --  still red . She disappeared behind the cedar hedge of the garden and appeared again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her face was visible now , white in the grey light , and Sally could see the smile on her lips and the happy , erect carriage of her head , as she advanced across the lawn . Her father had not stirred . He was watching his wife 's approach as Sally was watching it . The suspense of that approach was almost unbearable . A rendezvous with death , Sally was thinking . A rendezvous more bitter than if that death were her own . There was something heart-breakingly poignant in the gallantry of her mother 's movement , in the gaiety of her smile . We 'll never see her again looking just like that , ' thoughtp208Sally suddenly . She 'll never feel like that . Something will go out of her . It will never return . ' Her mother saw them then , as she passed beneath the window . Her smile broadened . She waved the bramble and nodded . The gesture , for Sally , was one of leave-taking , not greeting . Her mother 's figure disappeared behind the corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p209SALLY  was seated at the wheel of Alan 's blue roadster , guiding the car mechanically through the noonday traffic of Sheridan Road . Her eyes were fixed abstractedly on the license plate of the limousine in front of her . Caught by a sudden glint of spring sunshine , she raised them to look up at the grey clouds with white puffs at their edges , which a sharp March wind was blowing across a pale blue sky . When the clouds blew over the sun , the puffs were shot with shining streaks of silver . The lake was yellow and turbulent . The sheltered water of the Belmont Avenue yacht harbour a milky aquamarine . Very few boats were riding at anchor . Six or seven launches . A yawl , put up for the winter . The spring sunshine was cold . The grass plots were brown and the elm trees were leafless . Little whirlpools of dust rose on the street corners , at the feet of the skyscraping apartments , and Sally was conscious of the intermittent impact of the gusts of wind , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its progress down Sheridan Road . March , Sally was thinking , was a cheerless month in town . In Lakewood its wind and rain , its dust and mud even , held the promise of summer . Her thoughts flew to the plans for the little house that her father was talking of building beyond his garden for herself and Alan , when Alan finally came home . Her father thought that she should not move very far away from her mother and Sally heartily agreed with him . Her mother was still prostrated by the shock of Sam 's death . She could not sleep . She would not eat . She had grown so white and thin that her dark eyes were gaunt in her pale face and her rings rolled loosely on her emaciated fingers . When Sally 's father was home , she exerted herself to talk with him , very naturally , of family affairs  --  of Sally , of Alan , of the plans for the house in the garden ; but when he was gone , as he was all day , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of glowing colour and stole about the house , a black shadow , busying herselfperpetually with Sam 's possessions . She sat for hours in his room , reading his books , re-reading his letters , looking over his photograph albums for snapshots to enlarge  --  going up to the attic sometimes to rearrange the old toys that she had always said she was keeping for her grandchildren ; Sam 's steam engine , his mechanical railroad , his microscope , the hobby horse and farmyard of his infancy , with Sally 's dolls and doll house and doll carriage  --  they were all spread out neatly on the shelves nailed under the rafters . Surrounded by dusty trunks and packing-cases , her mother stood sometimes for hours in the chilly , dimly lit loft , just looking at them in silence . On such occasions she never seemed to care for Sally 's companionship . When her daughter slipped into Sam 's bedroom with the eggnog she must drink , or up into the attic with the coat she should put on , she always received her with the same gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or put on the coat , very docilely , but she seldom had anything to say to Sally . So Sally would soon return to her own room , or to the library , and toss a log on the fire , and stand gazing out of the window at the winter lake , and sit down , and try to read , and stare at her own black lap , and think of Sam , and finally return , with a sigh , to her own everlasting preoccupation  --  thinking of Alan . For Alan had not returned with the Eighty-Sixth Division when it had sailed , on the fifteenth of February , on the Antigone , for New York . Alan had not been with the Eighty-Sixth since his attack of flu , nearly a month before the armistice . From the hospital at Neuilly he had been ordered to Replacement and sent to the Rainbow Division Headquartersand had been assigned to his new duty and had joined the Rainbow Division , just south of Sedan . On arriving , with beating heart , at his first post under fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody wanted him and nobody expected him . Too many lieutenants already , ' the adjutant had grumbled and found him , still grumbling , a job of inspection of gasp212equipment . Alan had suspected that his work was entirely unnecessary . That the job was a joke put over on him by the more seasoned troops . He had seen five days of fighting , however , before the order came from Headquarters to withdraw , accompanied by a rumour that they were to be sent into attack at Metz . Two days later the armistice had found them encamped at Malmaison Farm , where the officers were living comfortably in a whitewashed farmhouse , built ramblingly around an open court . They had known for days that the Germans were retreatingand there had been less fire and the prisoners whom they had taken had been either old or very young . Still , the Rainbow Division had thought the war was going to last through another winter . Roads were hub-deep in mud . Tanks and tractors could not operate . Horses were dragging guns and transport wagons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross the Meuse River until spring , no matter what the Germans did . And there had been the rumour of the big attack . The cessation of hostilities came as a completesurprise to them . Sally had written eagerly , What did you do ? ' For surely , she thought , the celebration of the armisticeat Malmaison Farm must have been more exciting than that on La Salle Street . But Alan had written the laconic answer , We went to sleep . ' It was lucky that they did , for almost immediately the order came to follow the German retreat . Across France they followedit , through the war-worn country , into Belgium and over the German border at Echternach and up to the banks of the Ahr River not far from the Rhine . There they had halted . The American High Command was established in Coblenz . At a little town named Dernau in the Marienthal area , Alan had received his first news of Sam 's death . Cables and letters from Lakewood and from Uncle Fred in Paris , all forwarded in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nearly three months now , and he sometimes wrote despondently that he expected to be there forever , though there was absolutely nothing to do . They drilled , they had tactical exercises , they laid out positions on paper , in case of a sudden German attack.  | But the thought of attack was ridiculous . The natives were very friendly . The enlisted men were making the most of their friendliness . Against orders , of course . Friendliness was forbidden , But , Wer liebt nicht Wein , Weib , Gesang , Bleibt ein Narr sein Leben lang , ' wrote Alan . The officers winked indulgently at the escapades which they heard of from the loose tongues of their orderlies and kept , a little regretfully , their own distance and dignity , with the thought of a possible court martial hanging heavy over their heads . Alan had been once to Coblenz , for two days , on a mission with his Colonel , and had written that the Stars and Stripes were flying from the topmost turret of the fortress of Ehrenbreitsteinand floating from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the Rhine . German junkers were saluting American officers as they passed them in the streets . Doughboys were parading in the city squares . The American Military Police ruled Coblenz as peacefully and as complacently as the traffic cops ruled Chicago . Alan 's militaryduties were always over by lunch-time . In the afternoons he was free to ride horseback , usually alone , back from the Ahr River , in the trails through the Eitel Mountains . The mountainswere lovely and lonely and  --  he reassured Sally  --  perfectlysafe . There was no enmity . No sniping . No Germans , in fact , except an occasional pleasant peasant who looked like the woodcutter or the charcoal burner of a German fairy tale , eager to sell a cup of goat 's milk to the American HerrLieutenant . But there was no rumour of orders which would send the Rainbow Division home . Thinking of these things , Sally turned her wheel so that the roadster would curve past the policeman on the Diversey Boulevard corner and glide into the first stretch of the roadway in Lincoln Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bronze figure of the monument to Goethe and read its brief inscription , To the Master Mind of the German People . ' The monument was not beautiful  --  echt Deutsch , ' her fatherp213had always called it . Still thinking of the peasants who looked like woodcutters and charcoal burners , Sally remembered the argument that had raged around it and the protests of the patriotswho had wanted to destroy it during the war . The argumentalready seemed archaic . The monument had survived the protests , as had the prose and the poetry of the man of letters in whose memory it had been erected . Patriots , Sally reflected , were growing much less articulate . Americans were weary of the war . The four months seemed endless that had passed since the signing of the armistice . President Wilson was still in Europe . The papers had been full of his triumphant progress through France and England and Italy . They had headlined the fact that fourteen nations had endorsed his plan for a League . In Versailles , however , European diplomats were betraying a disquieting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' and in Washington , Henry Cabot Lodge , as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , was thundering his warning across the Atlantic that the non-resident President had better watch his step . The country was no longer single-minded . The war was won , and citizens were free to be dissatisfied with the results . Lodge and his followers were voicing vociferously their distrust of the League of Nations and the President 's Fourteen Points and were demanding that the United States he extricated immediately from all further entangling alliances . Their cry of America First ! ' was making strange bedfellows , litr some men in every camp , Republicans and Democrats , radicals and conservatives , idealists and realists , were united in a common cause against a high-handed , close-mouthed Executive , against the League Covenant with its provocative Article X , against the proposed concessions of the Treaty of Versailles , against anything and everything that might implicatethe United States of America and its army and navy in another European war . America First ! ' indeed , was the battle-cry of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diplomats abroad , but against the labour leaders at home . The cost of living was still rising . War wages were dropping . Strikes werep214broken by militia . Picketers were arrested . Sally 's father and Mr. MacLeod and her Uncle Lambert and Uncle George were all seriously alarmed over the spread of Bolshevism in the United States . They talked continually of the Red Menace , ' and Cora said cheerfully that her mother looked under her bed for a Muscovite every night before turning out the light . The response of the country to the Victory Loan , however , reassured them a trifle . Mr. MacLeod had prophesied that it would be oversubscribed by more than a billion dollars . If it were , Sally 's father declared , the heart of the country must be in the right place . Nevertheless , it sometimes seemed to Sally that very little had been settled by the Great War . Most things had been unsettled , in fact . Sometimes she suspected that no war could really be won ; that conquered and conquerors suffered alike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all wars were fought in vain . Sam had died in vain , and Derek Chancellor and all the thousands of other young men , on both sides of the trenches . Sam had died ingloriously , back of the lines , of disease , of neglect , perhaps  --  but now he was a hero . A man who had given his life to his country . But to what purpose ? Had Sam enlisted and trained and sailed and drilled in France and died of meningitis in a Bordeaux hospital , merely in order that those cynical diplomats whom Henry Cabot Lodge distrusted might apportion once more the well-worn spoils of war  --  the small defenceless nations , the colonies , the war debts- ? Sally sighed as the roadster rolled past the equestrian statue of Grant . No terms but unconditional surrender , ' she thought , as she glanced up at his grim , bearded countenance , staring unblinking at the southern sun , under the wide brim of his 1864 campaign hat . But Lincoln was beyond him  --  SaintGaudens'sLincoln , lost in thought , standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for us , the living , rather , to be dedicated here to the unfinished work  --  that from these honoureddead we take increased devotion for that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion ; that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain ' Ah  --  Lincoln said things better than even Woodrow Wilson , whop215said everything so well . But words lived only when men lived up to them . Lincoln 's words , like Wilson 's , were out of tune with the negotiations at Versailles . Touching and tender and true at Gettysburg , but when you thought of Sam 's grave in Bordeaux and then of the Star Chamber sessions of Clemenceau and Lloyd George and Orlando , they rang with the no more than irrevelant music of good rhetorical prose . Good rhetorical prose , reflected Sally , was nowadays a smoke screen with which the more gifted statesmen covered ugly facts  --  disturbing facts  --  facts which no man would fight , much less die , for . Yet Lincoln had hated war and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincere men and the deaths of the boys who had died for them lay heavy on their consciences . What had Granny said of Sally 's mother on the day that they had learned that the Eighty-Sixth Division was going to entrain ? She thinks that the people who fight wars approve of them . But she 's wrong . It 's not so simple as that . ' Nothing was simple , thought Sally with a sigh . She felt thoroughly depressed by the complexities of life . Alan might stay with the army of occupation for years  --  yet how silly , how unreasonable , that American soldiers should be occupying the Rhine Valley . How utterly foreign to the interests and the ideals of American life . From one point of view the Atlantic had shrunk to the size of a millpond . Yet it formed an insuperablebarrier between herself and Alan . If Alan were with her , Sally was thinking , it would be such fun to be motoring in town to have lunch with Maisie ! As it was , it was hardly any fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Maisie was giving a reunion party for the young folks ' of Mrs. Higgins 's boarding-house . She and Avery were living with Maisie 's father and mother in their Lake Shore Drive apartment , trying to decide whether they would build a house in Lakewood or rent an apartment of their own . Avery , as a young architect , favoured the plan to build . Maisie thought she would prefer to live in town . Bee and Tim had gone back to Waukegan , where Tim had taken a job under his father , the contractor . Sally had not seen either of them since she had left Rockford . Bee had written her twice  --  once when Samp216died and again at Christmas , enclosing a picture of the sixmonths-oldTimothy . Sally had answered both letters and had meant , all winter , to motor up to Kenosha , where , in Tim 's absence , Bee had been living with her mother , to see the baby in person . But she did not like to leave her mother alone in the house too long at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that she had not managed to do . Nevertheless , Sally was sincerely fond of Bee , and she had been really shocked when Maisie had said to her with a little giggle , on extending her invitation , I guess we 'd better lunch at the Casino . I ca n't imagine Mother sharing an entree with Bee and Tim ! ' Small loss to Bee and Tim , Sally had reflected indignantly , for she did not care at all for Mrs. Masters  --  a high-nosed , smartly dressed , aristocratic-looking woman , with a habit of glancing critically at all Maisie 's friends as if she were privately reflecting , I wonder now  --  are you really worth while ? ' She irritated Sally by referring , very casually but too frequently , to the life that she had led in New York and Southampton , before her husband 's business had taken him to Chicago . So , Why do n't you all come out to me at Lakewood ? ' Sally had urged and had then remembered that her mother did not yet feel equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great mistake . She said Sally 's father ought to make her go about and that Sally ought to bring young people to the house . But Sally 's father had said that his wife should live exactly as she chose . So Sally had accepted Maisie 's invitation to lunch at the Casino . When Sally had parked the roadster at the curb of Delaware Place , she found Maisie waiting for her in the smart little dressing-roomat the left of the club 's entrance . She was wearing a new spring suit with a skirt so hobbled that she could not take a step of more than eight inches and a straw hat with a spotted French veil that made Sally sigh with envy . Hello , darling ! ' she said . I have n't seen you for ages ! Where have you been keeping yourself ? ' Oh  --  I 've been home , ' said Sally vaguely . Having pressed her cheek to Sally 's , Maisie turned back top217the dressing-table . She looked earnestly into the mirror and then , raising her veil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder bowl and dusted a film of powder lightly over her pretty nose . I think , ' she said , still looking in the glass , we 're going to buy that land in Lakewood . Avery 's hell-bent to build a French farmhouse . ' Oh , Maisie , what fun ! ' cried Sally . Her thoughts flew instantly to the plans for her own house in the garden . Fun for him to build , ' said Maisie discontentedly , but I 'll have to live in it . Mother thinks it 's dreadful to bury me in the country . Lakewood 's all right in summer , of course , but how you stand it in winter --  " Oh , I love it in winter ! ' interrupted Sally eagerly . It 's so clean and so pretty and there are all the winter sports . Your land 's quite near Mr. MacLeod 's , is n't it ? ' Yes , ' said Maisie , but it 's nearer the Country Club . I wish there was something left on the lake . You early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. MacLeod '  --  Maisie put down the powder-puff and turned from the dressingtable  --  is this story true about Rose ? ' Yes , ' said Sally , it is . ' Her face lit up as she spoke . She was very much excited over Rose 's story . I think it 's so extraordinary , ' said Maisie . Why extraordinary ? ' demanded Sally . Well  --  what does she want of a war baby ? ' asked Maisie incredulously . I suppose , ' said Sally soberly , she thought she 'd never have one , now , of her own . ' Maisie 's face was very non-comprehending . But that 's nonsense . She 'll come home and gradually forget Derek and then she 'll marry somebody else . Adopted children so seldom turn out well . ' Sally was thinking that Maisie was talking just like Aunt Cora . Aunt Cora had said that Rose must be mad . She is adopting it , is n't she  --  not just supportingit ? I mean  --  she 's going to bring it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was the great idea . ' Is she doing it legally ? '  |p218I  think so . Uncle Fred helped her . ' Is it a boy or a girl ? ' A girl . Rose called her Comfort . ' Comfort ? That 's a funny Puritan name for a little frog . ' She 's not a frog . She 's the child of an English officer and an American nurse . Rose knew her mother . ' Maisie laughed . I bet there were lots of babies who were that . Illegitimate , of course ? ' I do n't know , ' said Sally firmly . She did , but she did not intend to tell . If it 's not , its parents would want it . ' They 're dead . He was killed in battle and she died when the baby was born . ' Maisie shrugged her shoulders . I ca n't see why Rose wants to borrow trouble like that . How old is it ? ' Six weeks . ' Oh  --  tiny , ' said Maisie . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as she was born . I 'm crazy to see her . Rose wrote that she was lovely . She sent a snapshot , but you could n't tell much by it . The baby was blinking . ' What does Mr. MacLeod say ? ' asked Maisie curiously . Oh , he thinks it 's fine . He thinks she 's just what Rose needs . He 's getting a nursery all ready for her . ' When is Rose coming home ? ' Just as soon as she thinks it 's safe for the baby to travel . She had a little difficulty over her food . Uncle Fred 's coming with her . She says she 'll be home by summer . ' Maisie turned back to the dressing-table for a last glance in the mirror . She caught the French hat by its tiny brim and pulled it down firmly , until it all but hid her lovely brown eyes . We 'd better go out into the hall , ' she said . I suppose Bee and Tim have never been here before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran into Avery . He pulled his grey felt fedora off his shiny black head and shook hands with Sally . Out of his khaki he did not look at all like the Avery ofp219Mrs . Higgins 's boarding-house . He was wearing a doublebreasted , English-cut suit , pale grey in colour , and his necktie was pale yellow and exactly matched the hem of the handkerchiefwhich protruded , ever so slightly , from his left breastpocket . He was smiling very pleasantly behind his black toothbrushmoustache . He looked , indeed , Sally suddenly realized , just like the Avery of Aunt Cora 's dinner-dance . The somewhatfrightening , very sophisticated , young man whom she had seen that evening for the first time . While her hand was still in his , Sally had an uneasy feeling that , in his mufti , she did not know him now any better than she had then . He was still smiling down at her when the front door of the Casino opened and the liveried doorman ushered in Bee and Tim . They , at any rate , looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ khaki , of course , but his blue eyes were so bright and his broad grin so contagious and his black hair so characteristically rumpled , that Sally , in her pleasure in seeing him , did not notice what his clothes were like at all . Bee was wearing the same tan ulster with the yellow lynx collar and the same black felt hat that she had worn in Rockford . Her cheeks were pink from the March wind and her black eyes were beamingand she , too , was smiling broadly . She kissed Maisie and hugged Sally and shook hands with Avery and cried , Oh , I just ca n't bear it that Alan is n't here ! ' Both she and Tim were glowing with enthusiasm over the reunion . They did not look as if they felt uncomfortable at all . Neither of them had cast even a glance at the elegant little interior in which they found themselves . Sally was conscious of a sense of amused satisfaction because Maisie 's condescending fears for them had been confounded . Avery took Tim to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led the way graciously to the grey drawing-room on the right of the door . In one corner of it , against a brilliant background of American Beauty window curtains , four middleagedwomen were sitting around a bridge table in silence . They were all pretty women , smartly dressed , with new spring hats , very like Maisie 's , pulled down over their eyebrows , and their hands , outlined against the green baize of the table-top asp220they raked in the tricks , had long , shiny , pink finger-nails and large sparkling rings . They nodded to Maisie and Sally recognized , just in time to nod , the woman belonging to the hand wearing the square-cut emerald as Nancy Carruthers , Uncle Fred 's old girl . Mrs. Malcolm Carruthers . Sally had not thought of her for ages . She was not the beauty she had been five years ago . Her eyes were harder and her mouth was redder and something slightly catastrophic had happened to her chin . Goodness me , thought Sally , she must be years older than Uncle Fred ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . Tim accepted his glass with alacrity . Well  --  here 's to the water wagon ! ' he said , as he tossed off the drink . Avery laughed and poured him another . As he sipped it , Tim went on talking . I do n't know what you and Bee and Maisie were doing , Sally , letting the country go dry , while we were drunk in France ! ' Daddy did n't approve of it , ' said Sally . Why , Mother practically dried it , ' laughed Bee . She 's been a member of the Women 's Christian Temperance Union for years . My father , ' she added candidly , was quite a hard drinker . Mother had a lot of trouble with Kerrigan 's saloon . ' Well , my mother says it 's barbaric , ' said Maisie . And Father has five thousand dollars ' worth of liquor walled up , now , in the apartment . I ca n't imagine what the country will be like after July first . ' Uncle George is storing liquor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's awful . Uncle Lambert agrees with F. Scott McBride . ' Who 's F. Scott McBride ? ' asked Maisie . He 's the State Superintendent of the Anti-Saloon League . You 've seen his name in the papers . Uncle Lambert had him out to speak to the Boys ' Club . He says if Chicago does her part in law enforcement , the whole world will be dry by r 930 . ' Let 's go out to lunch , ' said Maisie . As they strolled out of the drawing-room , Bee went on talking . Mother 's awfully interested in the Anti-Saloon League 's plan for campaigning in South America and Australia and thep221Orient . She thinks the Catholic Church should set its missionariesto work to dry up the heathen . But Father Delaney says they have enough to do , saving the heathen 's souls . Oh ! Is n't this pretty ? ' she added . Is n't it ? ' said Sally . She liked the Casino dining-room . Rectangular in shape , Directoire in style , it was at once formal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls were painted in a stylized design of drapery , topped with a dark frieze of black swans and classic arabesques . They were lined with satin-covered benches and recessed behind a smaller rectangle of green marbleizedpillars . The top of each pillar was decorated with three feathery plumes , painted yellow , sage green , and rose , on the flat wall of the cornice . In front of the benches and between the pillars , black glass tables were placed . Many of them were filled by luncheon-parties of women . The china on the tables was daffodil yellow and , in the centre of each , a little black glass Negro held a white crystal vase of shell flowers . The bright colours of the women 's gowns and the light flowers in their hats harmonized with the gaiety of the room . The March sunshine was slanting in the long west windows , across an orange sofa , mingling with the artificial light from the crystal chandeliers . Waiters were hurrying across the empty black floor in the centre of the room , carrying daffodil-yellow platters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trays of French pdtisserie . The light , high chatter of feminine voices was in the air . It 's going to be funny to see this place dry , ' said Maisie , sitting down at her black glass table . You never will , ' said Tim . You 're an optimist , ' said Avery . I 'm a realist , ' said Tim . How would they get it ? ' asked Sally . Daddy says in two years the liquor reserve will be drunk up . ' Yes , ' said Tim . But , after all , only a few millionaires are storing liquor . The man in the street is going to be thirsty . And soon . ' Of course , ' said Avery . But what of it ? He 'll have to go dry . '  | 2 2 I doubt it , ' said Tim . There 's moonshine . It 's almost a lost art in the Kentucky mountains , but I guess it can be revived . There 'll be rum-running , too , from Canada and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' You mean it will be like the drug traffic ? ' asked Avery . No , ' said Tim . Not just like it . Public opinion will be behind it . Normal men want liquor . ' Uncle Lambert says , ' said Sally seriously , that the League of Nations should enforce international total abstinence , just as they 're going to enforce peace . ' Do n't make me laugh ! ' said Tim . He helped himself liberally to chicken . You ca n't legislate appetites . Wherever there 's a foot and an elbow , there 'll always be a brass rail and a bar . ' I hope you 're right , ' laughed Avery . I know I 'm right , ' said Tim . A new era 's dawning . There 's big money to be made off liquor . ' How ? ' asked Sally curiously . The brewers and distillers are down and out . ' Yes , ' said Tim . But soon the smugglers will be up and in . I do n't know how they 'll work it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have always made their own red wine  --  treading out the purple grape in the washtub . I guess we 're as bright as the Dagos . Do you know what I 'd like to do ? ' What ? ' asked Sally . I 'd like to leave Waukegan  --  it 's not much of a town  --  and go live in Mexico and open a little hotel on the California border  --  or in Cuba , maybe  --  and make an honest penny off the winter tourist trade . There 's plenty of folks who are going to discover that they can afford to travel for a good drink --  " If you think you 're going to run that little hotel with me , ' interrupted Bee tartly , you have another guess coming . Mother did n't raise her girl to be a barmaid . I think you boys are all crazy . Women have always managed to get along without liquor and now men are going to learn that they can do the same . You need n't try to tell me that a bone-dry country is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Tim , for I know it is . I 've seen the Demon Rum at close quarters . My father was a loving husband and a steady worker , but I can rememberP223him coming home lit from Kerrigan 's bar every Saturday night . ' Well , what harm did it do him ? ' inquired Tim stormily . Sally met Maisie 's eyes and smiled . This was just like Mrs. Higgins 's boarding-house  --  hearing Bee and Tim quarrelling again ! He sobered up by Monday . ' You bet he did ! ' said Bee . He sobered up for Sunday morningMass . But it was fine for my mother , was n't it ?  --  seeing the money go that way and explaining to us children that Father was sometimes queer and begging Father Delaney to put him in mind of the wrath of God ! ' The brogue was creeping into Bee 's speech , and into Tim 's too , as it always did when they quarrelled . Just the same , I ca n't see he was any the worse for it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a grand man  --  generous and fun-loving and -- Yes . And he died in three days of pneumonia at the age of forty-three  --  leaving Mother with five kids . And she adoring him . Just pickled he was , inside , from those Saturday night sprees  --  and his heart went back on him -- Oh , many 's the temperance worker that 's died of pneumonia ! ' cried Tim disgustedly . And he had a grand time , while he lived . Avery will bear me out that the French nation is as strong as our own . And they drink red wine with their mother 's milk . Is a man to be living for nothing more than to keep from dying  --  ? ' Oh , shut up , Tim ! ' cried Bee . There 's no convincing you ! You 've the will of a mule ! I 'm holding no brief , myself , for living in Waukegan . It 's a slow town . I 'd like fine to move to Chicago , if you 'd take up with some respectable business in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for little Tim to say his father was a saloon-keeper ! ' Oh , Tim ! ' put in Sally pacifically . Do come to live in Chicago . That would be lots of fun . Alan will be home some day and then ' And what do you hear from him ? ' inquired Tim , all interest . Ile always got out of a quarrel as quickly as he got in . Nothing much , ' sighed Sally . He 's dreadfully bored . Theyp224drill to keep the men out of mischief , but he says there 's absolutely nothing to do . ' Trust the army to make you do nothing as solemnly as if it was something , ' grinned Tim . That 's what you call discipline . What did they do with me , when I landed in France , all set to kill the Kaiser ? Gave me a squad to lecture to , on cleanliness , care of the feet , and why we were in the war ! You remember , Avery ? ' Avery nodded . You were good at it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job with a chiropodist . ' I might . Or with a Chautauqua lecture bureau . I did nothing in France for America but lift my voice . ' It 's a good voice , Tim , ' laughed Maisie . You 're always eloquent . ' I am , ' said Tim promptly . But a subject like that would tax the powers of a Patrick Henry . ' Maisie laughed again . Coffee at the table , ' she said to the waiter at her elbow . And again to Tim , What kind of French pastry will you have ? ' That one , ' said Tim , solemnly pointing . Then , smiling contagiously at his hostess , It 's just grand to see you , Maisie . You girls should have been with us in France . ' I guess you found other girls , ' said Maisie lightly . How was the eloquence in the French tongue ? ' Impaired , ' said Tim . Decidedly impaired . I used to envy Avery talking it like a native . If I 'd ever foreseen I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Souge , I 'd have gone to the Beaux Arts myself . ' Sally was thinking what fun it was to listen to Tim 's mind barking again . To watch it run round them in circles . She glanced at Bee appreciatively . As she looked at her young husband , Bee 's eyes were shining with pride . With a sigh , Sally 's thoughts wandered to Alan on the Rhine . Bee heard the sigh and , turning to her , said gently , under the cover of the chatter and laughter , Sally , you must n't be thinking because of our nonsense we 're not all missing Alan . ' Her voice dropped to a lower note andp225shook a little as she added , And you must n't be thinking we 're not remembering Sam . ' I know you 're remembering him , ' said Sally quietly . Laughingmakes me remember . It makes me remember how he used to laugh himself . ' Bee nodded , understandingly . Beneath the black glass table she pressed Sally 's hand . Sally , ' she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was for a good purpose . The ways of the Lord we 'll never know . If Tim died ' Yes ? ' said Sally , as Bee hesitated . I 'd know he was wanted in heaven , ' said Bee simply . For no less reason would God ask me to give him up on earth . ' Maisie rose from the table . Avery was glancing at his wrist watch . I 've got to run , ' he said . I 'm going downtown for a manicure , ' said Maisie . Can I take you anywhere , Bee ? ' You can drop us at Field 's , ' said Bee . We 're buying a spring coat for the baby . ' But in the entrance hall she plucked Sally by the arm . Sally , ' she said , I want to tell you What ? ' asked Sally . The others had gone on ahead . Bee was looking at her earnestly . I hope you wo n't mind as a Protestant , but when Tim came home we had a Mass said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprang to Sally 's eyes . Oh  --  Bee ! That was  --  that was dear of you ! ' I waited for Tim to be sure he thought Sam would approve of it . I  --  I did n't want to butt in . But Father Delaney said the soul of a Protestant was very like that of a Catholic . A Mass could n't but help it . ' Sally squeezed Bee 's hand . I know Sam would  --  Sam would  --  ' She could n't go on with it . Bee smiled at her frankly . I 'm glad you think so , ' she said cheerfully . Arm in arm they followed the others to the door . Then ,  | Would you get a blue coat or a pink one for little Tim ? ' asked Bee brightly . He 's the spit of his father . Blue eyes and black hair . It 's already beginning to curl . Blue 's his colour , all right , but Mother says pink is a better buy . It never fades in the sun . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' Oh , soon ! You 're so near , in Waukegan . I could n't make Kenosha . ' Then Tim was shaking her hand . When you write Alan , ask him would he like to run that hotel with me on the border ? ' He grinned . Your red hair , Sally , would go fine behind the bar . ' I 'm sure he would , Tim . But his father 's holding a stool for him in the bank . ' Here 's the car ! ' called Maisie . They all pushed through the front door . Where 's yours , Sally ? ' Parked , ' said Sally , pointing . Avery was shaking her hand . Drop me at the office , ' he said to the chauffeur , as Bee and Maisie and Tim climbed into the limousine . Good-bye , Sally . Great to have seen you . ' He followed them . Bee waved from the window . Sally stood looking after the motor as it rolled away . She was thinking that peace changed things , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bee and Tim had now very little in common . Subtle distinctions , non-existent in Mrs. Higgins 's boarding-house , had crept into their relationship . She herself liked Bee much better than Maisie , and Tim had twice the brains of Avery , but , as things turned out , she would probably see very little , from now on , of the O'Haras , whereas Maisie and Avery were going to be her Lakewood neighbours . In her immediate circle , she could not help thinking , the war had done little toward establishing just democracy . When Alan came home Sally sighed as she turned toward his roadster . When Alan came home , of course everything would be all right . But  --  would it ? When Alan came , if he stayed away much longer , would he , too , seem different ? Would she seem different ? War and peace had rolled over their heads since they last met . Sam 's death . Her mother 's grief . Her father'sIp227dependence on her . The months alone in her little white bedroom . Alan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it up together in the house in the garden , seemed , at the moment , chimerical to Sally . She could not imagine what it would be like . Not like Mrs. Higgins 's boarding-house . Not like their honeymoon . Something quite different to which they were committed  --  solemnly committed at Saint George 's altar . Years stretched ahead of her , milestones on a long road twisting around a bend that obscured her view  --  a long road which she would walk with Alan . Roads that ran you knew not where were romantic , perhaps , but they were also frightening . Oh , dear ! ' thought Sally , in a sudden surge of panic , as she opened the door of the roadster . It  --  it is n't safe for him to stay away so long ! ' Sally sat with Mr. MacLeod and Alan at a window table in the Plaza Hotel dining-room , looking out over West FiftyNinthStreet to the twilit reaches of Central Park . The street lights bloomed pallidly on their tall standards , still dominated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the budding boughs of the elm trees partially obscured them , they looked like gigantic nocturnal flowers . On FiftyNinthStreet the traffic was moving slowly , jerkily , to the east and to the west . Street cars , taxis and limousines . Some hurryingpedestrians . At the curbstone in front of the window , three hansom cabs , relics of an age that was past , were waiting for chance sentimental fares who might like to drive in the park . The heads of the horses were drooping in the shafts and the greyhaired , high-hatted cabbies were nodding on their high-perched seats . The old men , the old animals , the old vehicles , gave a touch of melancholy to the scene . Inside the dining-room , however , lights were bright , waiters were hurrying , tables were filled with gay parties . White linen shone , silver gleamed , wine glowed in goblets , food smelled pleasantly of good French cooking . Some men at the tables , like Alan , were still in uniform . The women who were with them were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the flowers in their spring hats nodded . Here and there the bare heads and nude necks of a theatre party added to the gaiety of the room . Mr. MacLeod was talking to Alan of his plans for Alan 's work in the bank . His voice was confident , his face was radiant . Alan was sitting in silence . That silence , Sally thought , held reserves . At any rate , it kept enthusiasm well in check . He made no comment on his father 's statements . Day before yesterday Alan had landed , with the Rainbow Division , from the Leviathan , at Hoboken . Sally and Mr. MacLeodhad met him at the dock . They had stood on the pier as the great camouflaged liner , painted yellow and white and pale tan and blue and sea-green in splotches , had glided into her slip . The harbour had been a pandemonium of welcome . Every tug , every tramp steamer , every ferryboat , every liner in the slips had shrilled its whistle of applause . The Leviathan had responded with deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pier and floated from the tops of the customs sheds . The decks of the Leviathan had been packed , five lines deep , with khaki-clad men , crowding to the rails . They had waved and grinned and shouted their excitement at homecoming . The crowd on the dock had gone mad . It had screamed , it had cheered , it had adored the Rainbow Division . Here were authentic heroes . They had conquered the Germans . The Rainbow Division had been in action since February , 1918 . Sally had stood , her hand slipped through Mr. MacLeod 's arm , straining her eyes for a first glimpse of Alan . She could not find him in the khaki-clad ranks . Fleeting thoughts had terrifiedher . Illness at sea . Death . Some last-minute order that had detained him at Brest . But no  --  there he appeared , suddenly , sensationally , shouting on the gangplank . He dashed to the rope that restrained the waiting crowd . In almost a minute she was in his arms . He was in his father 's . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older and harder and broader about the shoulders . Taller , perhaps . She was realizing that , idiotically , she had forgotten what Alan 's face really looked like . She had forgotten his nose  --  the lines about his mouth . Had those lines been there before ? Little lines , scarcely noticeable , but very maturing . Then she was again inp229his arms . His lean , hard cheek , a little scratchy , was pressed closely to hers . Sally ! ' he was saying . Oh , Sally ! My darling ! ' His voice , at any rate , was exactly the same . It tore at her heart-strings . Sally was crying . Oh , Alan ! ' she sobbed . I have you  --  at last ! ' But Alan had had to leave them , almost immediately , to entrainfor Camp Merritt on Long Island . Sally could not come . At least  --  he knew nothing about the accommodations . He would wire . He would telephone . Oh  --  the relief to know that Alan now could telephone ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as he could get away . He had telephoned . He had telephoned that evening and the next morning and the evening after that . He had telephoned the second morning to say that he could get in to New York by dinner-time for the night . Sally had spent two days in nervous expectation . She had spent them walking the city streets . Mr. MacLeod had busied himself on Wall Street , but Sally had wandered up and down Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue and all the crowded side streets , staring into shop windows , considering hats , considering dresses , considering lingerie with which to dazzle Alan , buying this , buying that , reflecting that this was just like a wedding all over again , but much more exciting . More devastating , because you knew exactly what to expect . More terrifying , too , for that very same reason . More premeditated . In spite of her excitement , there was something a little cold-blooded in decking herself out for Alan once more as a bride . In setting the stage . Suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  --  did n't quite come off ? But it would . It would . Alan was still Alan . Nevertheless , now that he had come , now that he was here , now that they were dining together with no more than three feet of shining damask between them , Sally was conscious of a faint sense of restraint . Of shyness , really . Perhaps that was only because Mr. MacLeod was with them . But no one , looking at the radiance of his countenance , could wish that Mr. MacLeodwere not there . Alan , too , seemed slightly restrained . There was a shadow of diffidence in his manner . A question in his eyes . Those eyes were questioning her now . What was Mr. MacLeod saying ? Would you like to go to the theatre ? ' There was a little pause , broken by Alan . The question was now in his voice . Would you , Sally ? ' Why  --  why not ? ' Absurd of her voice to tremble . I think I 'd love to . ' All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowly . Then I 'd like it , too . ' ' I ' 11 get the tickets , ' said Mr. MacLeod , as he rose from the table . Come with me , children , and tell me what you 'd like to see . ' They stood in silence at the ticket-broker 's window . Sally could not bring her eyes to concentrate on his bulletin board of plays . " The Better ' Ole " ? ' Mr. MacLeod suggested . No war stuff , ' said Alan firmly . Gillette in " Dear Brutus " ? ' Alan shook his head . And no whimsy , ' he said . I think the world 's grown up a bit  --  got beyond Barrie . Let 's not be playfully optimistic . Let 's laugh . You know  --  a good stomach laugh . What about " Up in Mabel 's Room " ? ' So Up in Mabel 's Room ' it was . Their seats were in the fourth row . Alan sat between Sally and his father . Both men chuckled , incessantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farce . It seemed vaguely funny and scandalous . Nevertheless , she could not have said , at the fall of any curtain , at just what the slightly shocked , highly amused audience had been laughing . She could not keep her mind on the play . She was too conscious of Alan 's presence in the seat beside her , too conscious of his face , seen dimly in the darkness , of the touch of his arm on hers , of her sense of passing time , of minutes catching her up and hurrying her on to the moment when she would say good night to Mr. MacLeod in a hotel corridor and open a bedroomdoor and shut it again on herself and Alan . The moment when she and Alan would stand face to face alone , taking upp231life together on the terms on which they had left it . Absurd to feel so self-conscious about the approach of that moment . To feel a little bit  --  yes  --  afraid . When the moment came , Mr. MacLeod 's matter-of-fact smile , which did what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her over it . Breakfast at nine-thirty ? ' he said . Yep , ' said Alan , carefully casual . I 'll meet you in the dining-room . ' Good night , ' said Sally . Then , impulsively , I 'm awfully glad you 're here . ' Mr. MacLeod 's smile grew less matter-of-fact . Sally , ' he said warmly , you 're a darling . ' Is n't she ? ' said Alan . His tone was suddenly less casual . Sally walked into their room . She turned on the light and stood looking at the big bunch of pink roses that Alan had brought her , standing in a tall vase on the bureau . Together with the white ivory fittings from her dressing-case and her glass bottle of perfume , spread out beside them , they gave a touch of personality , of intimacy , to the impersonal room . She heard Alan shut the door behind her . She heard his steps approaching . She did not turn . Then , Sally ? ' he said . The question had returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For an instant he said nothing more . His steps came nearer . Then paused , directly behind her . Sally , ' he said abruptly , are you happy ? ' Of course I 'm happy . ' But still she did not turn to look at him . His hands closed gently on her shoulders . Sally , darling  --  I 've been away ten months . That 's nearly as long as we lived together . ' Yes , ' said Sally . Sally , I want to ask you one question . ' He pressed his cheek against her hair . His eyes were looking over her shoulder at her face in the mirror . Sally 's eyes met them there bravely . What is it ? ' she said.  | If  --  if we were n't married , would you marry me tonight ? ' The question startled Sally . Would she , she thought ? Why , absurdly enough , of course she would n't ! She would wait , she would see , she would try to find out what time and distance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take her time . But she could not say that to Alan . But  --  we are married , ' she protested . Yes . We are , ' said Alan . Then , very solemnly , I thank God we are . Because , if we were n't , you know  --  perhaps we might n't be ! ' With a little gasp Sally realized that Alan understood . After a moment he went on talking , his eyes still holding hers in the glass . I want so much to recapture what we had , Sally . I 've thought of it constantly . I 've never been untrue to you by a word or a gesture . But tonight ' Alan paused . Yes ? ' Sally whispered . Tonight  --  ? ' Tonight , I realized that  --  that , even so , things had happened to us . Things that we had n't shared . We were so young and we are so young that we  --  we 're different . We 're shy with each other . We 've got to begin all over again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you  --  I want you  --  terribly ' Alan 's voice trembled into silence . Sally was infinitely moved . She closed her eyes for an instant , her face raised , her head stretched back on Alan 's shoulder . She could feel his body , pressed close to hers . Little waves of emotion were rippling over her . She opened her eyes again and turned under his hands . I want you , too , Alan , ' she said . As his arms closed around her , she clung to him , silently . My darling  --  my  --  Sally , ' he was saying brokenly . Presently , It  --  it is recaptured , ' whispered Sally . This is just the same . ' But it was and it was n't . Beyond her emotion , and curiously detached from it , Sally was thinking , This is a different Alan . He 's older  --  more serious . He 's not a boy any longer . ' Sally did not yet feel quite married to him . She was trembling with excitement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willp233happen to us ? ' Then thought was submerged in feeling . The future was lost in the present . She did not care what happened to them . She was in Alan 's arms . The roses were budding in the Sewall garden . The mellow , yellow sunshine of the late June afternoon was touching them tenderly with amber light . From the garden path Sally could hear , across the silence of the lawn , the voices but not the words of her father and mother and Uncle Fred and Granny , who were sitting on the porch . She could see Willy , watering the grass beyond the pine tree , as he always did at sunset . His lean figure , in blue overalls , had relapsed into its comfortable , pre-military slouch . Willy was apparently light-hearted . He was wiggling the hose nozzle and throwing the crystal stream to right and to left in elliptical arabesques . Beyond the cedar hedge the rough yellow uprights ' and two-by-fours ' of Sally 's new house stood starkly against the dark green background of the oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . They had knocked off two hours ago , and Sally had come out with Alan , as she always did when he came home from the bank in the cool of the evening , to admire the accomplishment of the day . Rose was with them this evening . She had pushed the perambulator over at tea-time , to show Sally the baby , as she did two or three times a week . The baby was the darling of Rose 's heart and of Mr. MacLeod'salso . Sally had been just a little surprised by Rose . She did not look nearly as wan and thin and pulled down by her tragedy as Sally had expected . There was , to be sure , a new shadow in her eyes , a new maturity in her manner , but she was , if anything , a little heavier and healthier in appearance than she used to be , and , though she was markedly saddened by Derek 's death and spoke of it simply and sorrowfully , she seemed mainly preoccupied by thoughts of little Comfort . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden path and moving the perambulator softly up and down with four fingers on its handlebar . The child , Sally thought , was well-named . She was a comfortable baby . At the moment she was lying very placidly on her back among muslin-covered baby pillows , curving up her white-stockinged legs and waving her pinksweateredarms and cooing engagingly at the rattle hung just beyond her reach from the hood of the perambulator . She was four months old , so Rose said , bald-headed , blue-eyed , pinkcheeked , and mature enough to smile toothlessly back at Rose , as Rose smiled down at her . The living-room 's going to be swell , ' said Alan . His eyes were fixed admiringly on the skeleton of his future home . Opening on a terrace , like that , right next to the garden . ' With the south sun , ' said Sally , on its other side . ' Your sleeping-porch , ' said Rose , is what I like best . It 's really in the tree-tops . ' It looks small , ' said Sally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built . ' The head carpenter had told her that . In comparison , you know , with all the space they 're built in . ' Maisie 's looks monstrous , ' said Rose . But of course it 's right in our view . ' Four master 's bedrooms , ' said Alan , is n't a small house . ' Certainly not , ' said Rose . You wo n't be able to fill it . ' Give us time , ' grinned Alan . In ten years we 'll be adding awing . ' One baby fills a house , ' smiled Rose . Comfort 's all over the place at home . But Dad likes it . I must take her home now . She has her bottle at seven . ' Sally stooped over the perambulator . She put her face down on Comfort 's soft little stomach and sniffed luxuriously the baby odour of warm wool and talcum powder . Comfort 's hands were tangled immediately in her hair . Sally gently disengaged them . She 's darling , Rose , ' she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so clever to get her . ' Rose smiled once more . I think I was clever , too . ' Just then Aunt Cora appeared under the rambler-rose arch . She waved a book at Sally . I 'm bringing over that book on interior decorating , ' shep235called . There 's a splendid chapter on the Use of Glazed Chintz . ' Then , approaching the perambulator , she stood for a moment in silence , looking down at Comfort . Thank you , Aunt Cora , ' said Sally dutifully . Privately she was thinking that she intended to decorate her house to suit herself . That child looks healthy , ' said Aunt Cora . She is healthy , ' said Rose , a trifle indignantly . Aunt Cora did not reply . She stood peering down at cooing Comfort as if she had X-ray eyes . She 's never had a day 's illness , ' added Rose . Aunt Cora still stared at the baby . That may be , ' she said . But with adopted children you never can tell . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopt a baby , I think you should have a complete clinical record of what at least the last three generations died of  --  and be sure it has n't any aunts put away or dipsomaniacal uncles or -- Alan burst out laughing . You 're cheery , Aunt Cora ! ' I 'm practical , ' said Aunt Cora . And I think of the future . But , Rose '  --  Aunt Cora smiled amiably  --  she looks very sweet now . ' Rose knew Aunt Cora 's peculiarities . So , She is sweet , ' she smiled forgivingly . She 's sweetest of all in bed . I 'm going home to put her there . ' Aunt Cora stood in silence , watching Rose 's figure , pushing the perambulator before it , receding down the garden path . Then , I think Fred was crazy to let her take that child , ' she said . It was all his fault . If he had n't encouraged her -- I think it would be lovely to have a baby , ' said Sally . The warmth in her tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Sally , with that X-ray glint in them , and looked her very deliberately up and down . She found nothing to comment on , however . Well , ' she said briskly , you 're not in Rose 's position . I 'm talking about the folly of adoption . It 's hard enough to bring up your own children . ' Aunt Cora gave a little sigh.  | Sally knew what caused it . Aunt Cora was thinking of Cora 's pig-headed opposition to coming out ' with Kathleen at a garden-party in August . Kathleen , at eighteen , had just graduated from Broadmoor-on-Hudson and was eager to becomea debutante . Cora , at twenty , having managed to postponea formal debut for two years on the pretext of the war and her war work , was claiming that she had leaked out ' and that it would be absurd to rig her up , at this late day , in white tulle and rosebuds , to stand at Kathleen 's side . Aunt Cora had declared with solemnity that , at any age , you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had a ball last December ; but the family were in mourning for Sam . Now it was only suitable that  --  And of course Aunt Cora would have her way . She was determined to stand in flowered chiffon and a picture hat on her sunlit lawn , with her two daughters beside her and the noblesse of Lakewood moving formally before them . You know my Cora  --  and my little Kathleen . ' Dowagers and debutantes . Aunt Cora 's old beaux . Handshakes and compliments . Music and food . A good Sauternepunch . Lots of young men when the five-fifteen train came in . Dancing later , and a little petting , perhaps , with Kathleen in ecstasy and Cora in rebellion . Cora said she would like to get away from the family and try to write a novel . She still wrote verses and had experimented with short stories . She wanted to break home ties and become a professional writer . No chance of that , of course . The very thought made Aunt Cora 's blood run cold . No chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married . But Cora was not apt to marry any one of the young men who hung around Kathleen and she never met any others . Kathleen , undoubtedly , would marry promptly and brilliantly and make Cora an old maid . A spinster aunt in her twenties . But Aunt Cora was speaking again . I ca n't get used to seeing you around here , Alan . It must seem nice to be home . ' It does , ' said Alan pleasantly . Those months in Germany must have been the last straw . ' They were , rather , ' said Alan . They made you wonder what the war had been about . '  |p237About  ? ' said Aunt Cora sharply . Yes . The Germans in Marienthal did n't know  --  any more than we do here in Lakewood . ' Aunt Cora frowned . I think we know well enough , ' she said . We know that the Huns have menaced civilization since the dawn of history . ' When you see them , ' began Alan , when you live with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' she said decisively . You did n't know what they were thinking . You could n't talk to them . ' Oh , yes , ' said Alan mildly . We could . We did . ' Aunt Cora shrugged her shoulders . College German ! ' she said scornfully . Alan smiled . College German , as far as I was concerned , ' he admitted . Just " Guten Tag " and " Grass Gott " and " Bitte schon " to the peasants and the tradespeople . But some of the Germans had relatives in America . They always expected you to know them . And lots of the enlisted men were German-Americans , like Willy . They spoke German like a mother tongue . ' Then they should n't have been sent into Germany , ' said Aunt Cora firmly . I 'm surprised there was n't a mutiny in the ranks . It ought to be a lesson to us to stop immigration . This country is too easy-going . America for the Americans ! ' With that , Aunt Cora moved off down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' she called back to Sally . Alan stood watching her retreating figure with a little frown . Sally touched his arm . You must n't mind Aunt Cora , Alan , ' she said . I do n't , ' said Alan . But speaking of aunts who ought to be put away  --  ' Sally giggled . Oh , well ! ' His tone was irritated . Oh , well  --  what ? ' asked Sally sympathetically . Nothing . Just  --  all the people , here at home , seem a little queer . ' Queer ? ' questioned Sally . But she had noticed before this Alan 's lack of interest in and tacit withdrawal from family discussion.  |p238He  turned to her definitely . Yes . I tell you , Sally , there 's a gap between the point of view of the men who fought this war in France and the point of view of those who watched them do it . Of course , I did n't fight it . I only saw five days of action at the front . But I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in it from the very start . When you fight a war , yourself , you do n't try to justify it . You know it ca n't be justified . You know it 's nothing more than a dirty job you have to do . But that does n't make any difference . You 're not there to know anything . You see ignorance and incompetence and mistakes in high quarters and discomfort and suffering and death in low ones . You see an amazing amount of courage everywhere . Just as you do in peace . But in war you 're not supposed to act on what you see . The only public virtue is to obey orders and the only private one is not to behave like any kind of a skunk . When you 've started a war , you 've simply got to win it . You ca n't afford to lose . But , my God ! There are people here at home who think war 's grand ! Who think it 's beautiful and heroic and  --  and right . It 's incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' said Sally softly . You said it was a moral issue . You said it would make a new world . ' Well  --  maybe it has , ' said Alan soberly . But what kind ? The old world was pretty good to junk . All those little French villages  --  Belgian villages  --  Italian  --  Russian  --  all the rest of them  --  exterminated . All those men  --  killed , maimed , and blinded . And then those dumb German peasants who had n't the least idea of what it was all about . Maybe we had to fight . I do n't know . It seemed as if we did . But it 's done something to the fighters . I did n't realize it until I came home . What was it all about , if now we 're going to go on just as we always have  --  ? ' Who ? ' said Sally . ' We ? ' Yes . You and me . Everybody here in Lakewood . Lakewood'sjust a sample of the world . Why , I nearly go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war  --  except for the war debts . Dad really agrees with Aunt Cora . He'sp239not so violent , but he thinks the war was fought to suppress the Huns . Now they 're suppressed , he 's just back where he was  --  talking about the same things he did in 1914 . Bond issues and mergers and mortgages and balances , and God knows what all ! He thinks they 're just as important as he did then . He thinks that row in Europe was a disagreeable interludeand now it 's over . So we can forget it  --  except for taking advantage of it to make more money . ' But , Alan , ' said Sally , bewildered , he 's a banker . What else would he do ? Life goes on . ' Yes . Oh , God , I do n't know ! But there must be something . Where 's that new world we were fighting for ? Sally -- Alan hesitated . Yes ? ' said Sally . The note of hesitation in Alan 's voice became more marked . Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , starting right in to build this house ? ' Our house ? ' Sally stared at him in amazement . Yes , ' said Alan uncertainly . I 've been thinking about it . It ties us down . ' But  --  we want to be tied down ! ' cried Sally . ' That 's all we ever wanted . You said in Rockford that you wanted a life like the lives that our fathers and mothers had before us . ' But can we get it ? ' asked Alan . Why not ? ' said Sally . Maybe the time for that kind of life has passed . The life you lead depends on the kind of person you are . And then again , the kind of person you are depends on the life you 've led . It all goes round in a circle . I 'm not clear about it , I know . But I do n't think the older generation can get away with raising all that hell and telling us kids we were fighting to save humanity and then expecting us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . The world ca n't open and swallow up the war as if it had slipped into the crack of an earthquake . It wo n't stay swallowed . The earth may quake again . ' Oh , Alan , ' said Sally consolingly , I do n't think there 'll be another war in our lifetime . ' That was all the consolation that ghe herself demanded . But ,  | It 's not that exactly , ' said Alan discontentedly . Another war would give us something to do . Nothing else does . We 're restless . We 're thinking . We want to know the answer . Not body 's answering anything down there at the bank . Just " business as usual . " I do n't think we ought to stand for it . ' But , Alan '  --  Sally 's eyes were wondering  --  what do you want ? ' She herself wanted nothing more than this house in the garden . This house and Alan , who had seemed , after the first shock of reunion , more closely united to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound like a fool , I know , but I want something to live for . ' He stopped then , and looked down at her . A slightly apologetic note crept into his voice . I 've got you , of course , Sally . But you 're just more of me . I mean  --  we 're one person . I think we both deserve something , after all we 've been through . I know that sounds fatuous . For in one way we do n't . We 're not important . But in another way we do , because we 're young and we  --  we were hopeful . ' Alan , ' said Sally very seriously , I 'm hopeful still . I do n't want anything better than just life as we planned it . Alan ' Her voice faltered . Yes ? ' said Alan . He looked moodily down at her . Shb would not have chosen this moment , but something irrepressibleimpelled her to speak . Alan , I think I 'm going to have a baby . ' His face changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick breath . Sally  --  are you sure ? ' She nodded , smiling faintly. ti I think so . It will come in February . ' He was still staring blankly . Why , Sally  --  that  --  that 's grand ! ' Her smile broadened a little . A smile of expectation . But still he did not take her in his arms . Instead , Well , I guess that settles it , ' he said slowly . Sally felt herself flushing . She drew back a step in the garden path . Settles what ? ' she asked sharply . Alan smiled very cheerfully.  |p241Settles  the question whether the house was premature . Of course , I  --  I 'm terribly glad about it , Sally ! ' I should think you 'd better be ! ' cried Sally indignantly . Why , I thought I might never be going to have one ! ' Her indignation brought Alan 's familiar grin . I always knew you would , ' he said , because you do everythingso perfectly . Why , Sally , it 's simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have babies than to knock around the world . ' Then penitently , Sally , darling , you 're not angry ? ' Sally 's face was rather grim . Well  --  I do n't think you acted very much like the conventionalyoung father of fiction . ' But , Sally  --  you surprised me . I suppose , in real life , young fathers are often surprised . You know I wanted children . But it takes  --  it takes a moment to get adjusted . Now I am adjusted . Sally , sweetheart ' Yes . ' Perhaps  --  perhaps a baby will make all the difference . ' Alan 's voice was eager . I mean , perhaps it will make me see some sense in the bank . It almost does already . Makes me see , I mean , that it is n't so awfully important whether or not I enjoy myself or whether I know the answer . ' Alan 's face was shining in the light of a great simplification . A baby is , after all , rather like a war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened , there 's nothing for me to do but obey orders ! ' And not behave like a --  ' Sally 's voice trembled intolaughter . Alan supplied the word . Skunk ? ' he questioned . No , ' smiled Sally . You 'd never do that . Just not like a  --  a bachelor . ' Alan laughed aloud . I wo n't , ' he said . I 'm called to the colours . We 're off again to make a new world ! No bunk about it this time , and we 've both enlisted . Kiss me , Sally ! ' But , Alan , you  --  you do like it ? ' She had to ask him before her lips met his . Of course I like it . I 'm crazy about it . En avant , mon vieux ! '  | This was better  --  this was much better , thought Sally , in his arms . But still , it was not perfect . She had a strange feeling that something  --  something she did not understand  --  had died in Alan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed it . Or perhaps that she had only knocked it unconscious . If so , Sally hoped devoutly , an actual baby would give it its coup de grace . An actual baby would make Alan happy . That was what babies were for . Her arm in his , she stood looking up at the framework of the house in the oak copse . We 'll give him the east bedroom , Alan , so he 'll have lots of sun . I 'm sure he 'll be a boy . ' We 'll call him Sam , ' said Alan . Samuel Sewall MacLeod . ' And the next one Alan . ' And the one after that Sarah Baines . ' Alan was laughing again , but Sally was suddenly serious . Alan , ' she said , I hope you know why we 're having all these children . ' Why ? ' laughed Alan . To tie me to your apron strings ? Because we love each other . ' Her voice was shaking . Alan 's fingers tightened on her arm . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction . That fact stands , Sally , in any kind of world . ' PART TWO1928-1933p2SALLY MACLEOD leaned back in one corner of her father 's library sofa and closed her eyes , a little wearily , to shut out the familiar family scene . She wondered , vaguely , why she always kit so tired by nightfall . Busy all day long , of course , with her house and her friends and her children . Still  --  it was not as if she had anything really important to do . Tonight , the Sewalls , Truesdales , and MacLeods were gathered together to listen to the radio returns of the Smith-Hoover election , and it seemed by this time  --  nine o'clock in the evening  --  that that election was already assured . Sally 's father and Mr. MacLeod and her Uncle George and Uncle Lambert were smoking their after- ( I inner cigars in a state of benign satisfaction . Uncle Fred was lamenting that his hero , Al Smith , was getting the bird . If you did id not count Georgie , who still seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years ago , as a senior at Harvard , had horrified Aunt Cora by succumbing to the influenceof a radical professor of economics and turning parlour socialist  --  Uncle Fred was the only member of the entire family connection , male or female , who had not supported , as usual , the G.O.P.Georgie had cast his vote , with bravado , that morning , in the Lakewood barber shop , for Norman Thomas , and Uncle Fred had subversively supported Al Smith from the first . To Sally 's father 's mild inquiry as to whether he wished to see the Federal Government handed over to Tammany Hall , and to Uncle Lambert 's outraged demand as to whether he wanted the Pope to be ruling the White House , and to Aunt Cora 's shocked question as to whether he thought Mrs. Al would be capable of entertaining the British Ambassador in the style to which he was accustomed , Uncle Fred had preserved an unbroken front.  | I put my liquor before your principles , ' he had said cheerfully , and went about the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttonhole in the form of a small brown derby and whistling The Sidewalks of New York . ' However , Uncle Fred was now meeting , as Granny had just said , his come-uppance . ' Granny had motored in town with Sally 's father that morning to cast her vote for Herbert Hoover , in the basement of a Cass Street boarding-house , next door to her own home . The old neighbourhood was changing , but Granny would not move out of it . Her neatly kept lawn , her carefully brushed steps , her polished window-panes and her Victorian lace curtainsformed a little oasis of respectability in a block which had degenerated from the grandeur of the nineties into the drab dreariness of a good neighbourhood gone to seed . Shabby lodging-houses , small stores , Masonic lodges , even speak-easies , had crept up around her . Aunt Cora was sure that a drug addictboarded across the street . Still , I ' 11 die where I 've lived , ' said Granny firmly . And behind her brownstone front , at least , everything was unchanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The black marble clock , under the bronze statue of Justice , ticked time away , imperturbably , on the parlour mantel shelf . In the bow window near it , Beata Bianca still simpered under the marble lace folds of her veil . Behind her , the looped and criss-crossed curtains shut out the deplorable degradation of the neighbours . At the age of eighty-four , however , Granny emerged from her static interiorto take a lively interest in all family and even national affairs . Sally still often thought that she was younger than her own children . For Sally could not help realizing , though always with a little shiver of dismay , that her father 's generation , in their fifties and sixties , were beginning to seem old . Uncle Fred , to be sure , at fifty-two , kept a certain boyishness of manner . He would keep it until he died . But her father and Mr. MacLeod and Uncle Lambert and Uncle George were all grey-haired and settled . The bright , brittle dignity of position , which they had maintained so lightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost imperceptibly , in the course of the last fewp247years , into the more sombre , more authentic , dignity of age . Stout , white-haired Aunt Adelaide seemed frankly an old woman . Aunt Cora , at sixty  --  thanks to the administrations of 1 iclena Rubenstein  --  could sometimes succeed , in a soft light , in looking no more than a faded forty-nine . The rise of the cult of the beauty parlour in the last decade had come just in time to lift Aunt Cora with it . Face creams , lipsticks , bobbed hair , and short skirts had done what they could for her . She was never ridiculous and still impressively fashionable . But in tired moments , in broad daylight , in the Loop ' or on the golf course , Aunt Cora looked every one of her years . At that , she sometimes seemed younger than Sally 's mother who was four years her junior . The few white threads which had appeared so quickly in Evelyn Sewall 's wavy , black tresses , after her son 's death , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and lovely , was now a grey cloud . Beneath it her blue eyes still shone , sweetly or stormily , in emotional moments , and a smile could cast over her features the eager illusion of youth . But something had gone out of her  --  something gallant and gay  --  as Sally had foreseen it would , on the day t hat she learned of her son 's death in France . Sam and Mother both died young , ' Sally had once said to Alan . That young mother had taken her place with the boy she had lost , in Sally 's most tender memories . Sally was thinking , as she sat in the corner of the library sofa , listening to the consciously cultured voice of the radio announcer , how curious it was that everyone already accepted the radio as a matter of course . Four years and a half ago , when Horace Sewall had bought the archaic forerunner of the brown walnut cabinet , from which that voice was mysteriously issuing , it had seemed a miraculous novelty . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sally thought , with a shiver , that she herself must be growing old . Time passed so quickly . It seemed to her only yesterday that Georgic Truesdale was rigging his amateur aerial on Aunt Cora 's porch roof and anchoring his ground wire to the playroom plumbing and sitting up , night after night , alone with his crystal set , headphoneson ears , breathlessly reporting to an incredulous familyp248at breakfast that , at one o'clock in the morning , he had actually heard Seattle ' for a moment , or caught a snatch of Yes , We Have No Bananas , ' sung in a roof garden in New York . But that was really five years ago  --  the summer of ' 23  --  the summer after Georgie went to Harvard . One year later , when her father 's first radio was new , she and Alan , on this very sofa , had listened , with a deep sense of the miraculous , to the oratory of the deadlocked Democrats in Madison Square Garden , and had heard Uncle Fred 's hero , Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reiterated choric cry , Alabama  --  casts  --  twenty-four votes  --  for  --  Oscar  --  W.  --  Underwood ! ' Now the pleasant polish of the announcer 's carefully articulated periods no more than amused her . These  --  election returns  --  come to you by the courtesy of  - -  the Chicago Tribune  --  W.G.N. , Chicago  --  speaking from  --  the Drake Hotel W.G.N. , Chicago , was girdling the continent in its stride . It had been on the job since the first polls closed on the Atlantic seaboard . At six o'clock it had reported , First complete  --  election returns  --  from  --  Sauk Centre , New Hampshire  --  Hoover 26  --  Smith 2  --  Thomas i . ' After dinner , when the family had assembled in the library to listen in earnest , returns were tumbling in like ninepins  --  tumbling in on the Sewall hearth-rug from Connecticut and Kansas , from Massachusetts and Minnesota , from Nevada and North Carolina , from New York and New Mexico , from Texas and Tennessee , from Ohio and Oregon , from Michigan and Montana . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' it was  --  by Vachel Lindsay flashed through Sally 's mind . While I sit by the milestone And watch the sky , The United States goes by ! ' The United States was going by on the Sewalls ' hearth-rug and it was confirming the verdict of Sauk Centre , New Hampshire'stwenty-nine voters . The Solid South was broken . Al Smith had lost his own State of New York . Well , ' said Aunt Cora triumphantly , it 's certainly a land-slide. '  |p249The  voice of the radio announcer broke in on her words . The New York Times  --  has conceded  --  the election ofHerbert Hoover  --  to the presidency  --  of the United States Uncle Fred interrupted in his turn . Well  --  let 's turn it off . I guess it 's all over but the shouting . Here 's where I kiss my liquor good-bye for another four years . ' ' It would do you good if you did , ' said Aunt Cora reprovingly . ' I do n't see how you can be so incorrigibly frivolous . ' ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm honest . I vote as I drink . I 've never seen any enthusiasm on your part , Cora , for " the noble experiment . " Mr. Volstead 's driven you to the gin bottle , along with the rest of the girls . ' ' Fred ! ' cried Aunt Cora , in honest horror . ' You never saw me  --  or George either  --  the worse for liquor ! ' Uncle Fred grinned . ' I 've never seen you the worse for liquor , sweetie ! ' He tossed a kiss to his sister . ' But I 've seen George the better for it . I knew George in his salad days . Why , I was an undergraduate when he came back to Cambridge for his tenth reunion . He carried it well , but ' Fred  --  do n't be ridiculous ! ' said Aunt Cora sharply . She glanced apprehensively at her three children . Cora , Kathleen , azzd Georgie , sitting side by side on the window-seat , were smilingvery cheerfully at their Uncle Fred . They always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . ' And you have n't given a party for at least eight years that was n't floated in alcohol , ' pursued Uncle Fred reproachfully . ' None of us have  --  except Lambert . I have to admit that Lambert is a dry . He can vote for Hoover with a clear con-science . ' Uncle Lambert interposed pacifically , in his pleasant pulpit voice . Important as the problems are which are presented by law enlircement , ' he said , ' I can not but feel that they are secondary in this campaign . Prosperity is the main issue . Coolidge Prosperity , continued under the Republican a gis  --  or a Democratic depression , introduced by low tariff  | I do n't believe , ' said Mr. MacLeod earnestly , that even the Democrats could bring about another depression . Not at this time . ' Nor at any time , ' said Sally 's father , with equal earnestness . The world is entering a new era . There has never been anything like it before . In that era the United States is assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living . When Herbert Hoover said that , with the help of God , we should soon be in sight of the day when poverty would be banished from this nation , he Said a mouthful , ' said Uncle Fred , with another grin . I ca n't believe , ' said Granny gently , from her armchair , that there will ever be a time when poverty does not exist . It stands to reason that even the people who have money might possibly lose it Her eldest son interrupted her . Mother , you do n't take into account the inexhaustible opportunitiesthat this country offers to make more . We have n't touched its possibilities . Besides  --  times are not what they were . People are not what they were . Education has spread . In this era , not only the capitalist , but the man in the street  --  just the ordinary family man , with a tidy little business of his own  --  has learned how to take care of his money . He has learned how to spend it and how to invest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values to get himself a nice little home . He has a stake in the country . On the installment plan , perhaps  --  but he ca n't lose . In fact , he 's sure to win . There are fortunes to be made in these co-operative apartments and part-payment subdivisions . There are fortunes to be made in the market . Though of course I would n't advise any man to speculate who did n't know the rules of the game . Only last week I took occasion to warn one of the elevator boys in the bank . Alan told me he had asked him for a tip on General Motors . I said , " My lad , do n't monkey with the buzz-saw . The men who are operating on Wall Street know more than you do . " Of course , I do n't know if he took my advice . ' He did n't , ' put in Alan from his stool on the hearth-rug . Then added , with cheerful disrespect for his father-in-law , And in four days his stock went up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see ? He 'll probably make a nice little nest egg . ' More probably , ' said Alan , he 'll buy a Chevrolet convertible coop , painted Fontainebleau Fawn . ' Well , what if he does ? ' said Sally 's father benignly . Keep the money in circulation . The consumers are the rock on which the prosperity of this country stands . There are twenty-three million car-owners in the United States of America . Think that over , Mother , and see if you ca n't feel that poverty is on the way toward banishment . ' We 'll never banish poverty , ' said Georgie Truesdale suddenly , until we have a Socialist State . ' Oh , for mercy 's sake , Georgie ! ' cried his mother vehemently . You make me so tired ! You act exactly as if you had n't bought a new car yourself last month ! How you could bring yourself to drive to the polls in it to vote the Socialist ticket is beyond mc ! But the trouble with all you Reds is , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give your own money away . Look at Russia ! I suppose there 's no poverty there  --  or hunger  --  or misery  --  or oppression ! You ought to get down on your knees and thank God for Herbert Hoover . He 's the poor man 's best friend . In war and peace , he 's done the world more good than all your Socialists and Communists and Bolsheviks , rolled into one ! What have you ever done , I 'd like to know , to abolish poverty ? Do n't talk to me about the Socialist State until you 've given up your allowance ! ' Georgic looked frankly nettled . He rose to his feet and strode to the hearth-rug and threw his cigarette in the fire . If you think , Mother , you 're a monument to logic ' he began . Do n't talk to your mother like that , ' said Uncle George , almost truculently . He was thoroughly ashamed of his radical son . Mr. MacLeod chuckled indulgently . Oh , let him alone , George . He 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' protested Georgic hotly , from his stand on the hearth-rug . The best minds in the country agree with what I think . All the economists say this market 's going to bust . '  | Economists , Georgie , ' said Mr. MacLeod , are n't very practical . Their theories are apt to be a bit wild . You see , they are n't playing for money . And you know , yourself , from the bridge table , that playing for money makes you sharper on the game . ' Sharper is right , ' put in Uncle Fred amiably . Mac , I bet neither you nor Horace ever entered the market , without an ace up your sleeve . ' Mr. MacLeod 's shrewd eyes twinkled . Four of'em , sometimes , Fred , ' he admitted genially . That 's why Horace warned the elevator boy at the bank . He knew . But these college professors do n't . ' Say ! ' cried Georgie , without ceremony . How much did you know yourself when the market wobbled last June ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Italy . Screams from you and Uncle Horace , and a general run to cover , the day the ticker tape fell two hours behind the selling orders on the floor . You thought then the bulls were stampeding . How much did you lose , that day , the two of you ? I 'd just like to know ! ' ' Georgic ! ' said Aunt Cora , in hushed , pained accents . Well , we lost plenty , ' said Mr. MacLeod , still genially . But we 've more than made it up since then . The nomination of Herbert Hoover established the stability of the market . A year from now the prices quoted today are going , to seem like lows . It 's going on and up . ' In his turn Alan rose to his feet . Then , " God 's in his heaven , all 's right with the world , " I suppose , ' he remarked succinctly . Well  --  I ca n't say that I care very much if He and it are . ' Sally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home . But what was the use of stirring up the family ? Why not , son ? ' asked Mr. MacLeod . Oh , hell ! ' remarked Alan profanely . I do n't know . Of course , I 'm perfectly sure , Dad , that you 're right . You always are . But what of it ? That 's what I want to know . Where 's it all getting us ? I know I sound fit to be tied  --  but down there at the bank I just get fed up with making money . There we all sit , making it , hand over fist , day after day , month after month ,  |p253year  after year . Nothing 's really jolted us since the hard times of ' 21 . I would n't call that little thank-you-ma'am in ' 24 really a jolt . The slight unpleasantness of last June , that Georgie just referred to , was only a moment 's ornament . Well  --  I like games of chance , all right . But in this game the dice are loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And now you say we ca n't lose . Where 's the excitement ? ' Granny looked rather critically at her grandson-in-law . Your father and Sally 's grandfather , Alan , ' she observed with some asperity , did n't go into banking for excitement . ' No , ' said Mr. MacLeod soberly . His face was puzzled as he looked at his son . But I always found excitement in banking . ' So did my husband , ' said Granny honestly . But it was a by-product . And the money was a by-product , too . That 's something you children will never understand . The Farmers ' Loan and Trust Company was more to your grandfather than just stone and mortar and it was more than an opportunity to beat the market . It was a solid foundation on which Chicago 's progress and security could be built . By serving it , he served his city . No one seems to feel like that any longer , about anything . ' I do , Granny , ' said Georgie very promptly . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Granny looked up at him , very gravely and tenderly , for a moment . Then her thin lips twitched a little and a glint of irrepressibleamusement shone in her sherry-coloured eyes . But Georgie , ' she said simply , the Socialist State is nonsensical . ' Those seven simple words seemed to dispose very adequately of the Socialist State . But Georgie was not silenced . Granny , ' he said , if you were my age , I bet you 'd believe in it . ' Granny recognized the compliment in his tone . Well , ' she said , smiling , I 'm not . I 'm just fifty-nine years older than you are . But I 've grown so old and I 've seen so many changes that I 've almost come to feel that it does n't make much difference what you believe in  --  the thing that 's important is a state of belief . It 's much better to believe in nonsense than in nothing , Georgie . In fact , it 's often engaging . But when Alanp254stands there and tells us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement , well  --  I feel there 's something definitely wrong with him . ' There 's nothing wrong with me , Granny , ' said Alan reassuringly . I 'm only bored . ' As he spoke , he drew a cigarettecaseout of his pocket and selected a cigarette . Granny watched him for a moment in silence . Finally , Yes , ' she said . Bored . And you 're thirty-four years old , with good health and a good job and a pretty wife like Sally and two fine sons . ' I did n't say I was bored with Sally , ' said Alan quickly . He paused to hold Granny 's eyes for an instant , over the flame of his lighted match . But he is , sometimes , ' laughed Sally cheerfully . The tension of that instant had been real enough to impel her to break it with the light touch . Well , good Lord ! Who is n't bored ? ' said Kathleen suddenly . She , too , rose from her place on the window-seat and took her stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked very pretty there , slim and straight in her short white evening frock , with her thin white arms and her thin silken legs and her cropped hair fluffed out like a golden aureole around her pale , thin face . The pink cheeks of Kathleen 's early girlhoodhad faded . Her astonishing hair and the blue of her eyes and the carmined line of her lips and the flesh tones of her stockings were the only colour notes in the picture . Sally thought suddenly that an artist would like to paint her . Avery Caldwell had said recently that she looked like a white fox . I do n't know why anyone should be bored , ' said Aunt Cora firmly . Oh , Mother ! ' Kathleen 's protest was instant . I 'm bored to tears , all the time ! What do I do  --  great grief !  --  but look for excitement ? I 'll say I do n't find it , but that 's not because I leave a stone unturned . Here I am , twenty-seven years old , still knocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older than I was when I took my first drink ' Kathleen ! ' said Aunt Cora , once more in pained accents . Uncle Fred smiled  |p255She  likes to talk like that , Cora , ' he said consolingly . She does n't really mean it . Anyway '  --  he met his youngest niece 's eyes and his smile broadened  --  she behaves herself pretty well . Takes after her father in that . Holds her liquor well -- That 's truer than it 's funny , ' observed Kathleen coldly . I often wonder , myself ; why I behave as well as I do . I want to get married , of course , but I do n't see anyone around who seems to me worth marrying . You all know that I 've conscientiouslytried , for five years , to marry Billy Bangs ! ' Everyone laughed at that , as Kathleen meant them to , exceptAunt Cora , for Billy Bangs was Kathleen 's most slavish adorer . But Sally knew , as Aunt Cora did not , that Kathleen 's ridiculous words were quite true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and had broken two secret engagementswith him because she could not more than like him . Aunt Cora had first regarded Billy as a harmless young man , and then as a matrimonial menace , but of late she had softened toward him . Billy , though dull , was irreproachable , and Sally sometimes thought that Aunt Cora had come to consider him , a little despondently , as Kathleen 's one white hope . It was curious that Kathleen , who had been such a belle and was still such a charmer , had not made the brilliant and romantic match in her early youth that Sally had expected for her . I 'm not bored , ' said Cora abruptly , from the window-seat . At least , I 'm only bored superficially . You 're not essentially bored as long as there are things you really want to do . Kathleendoes n't want to do anything , any more  --  except , of course , hang out of her tower window and see a silver knight come riding . And that is purely chimerical and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts of life . But I want to work . If this novel I 've been fussing with for four years should really turn out to be a world-beater , I 'd just jump out of my skin for joy . I know exactly what I want to do , but Mother wo n't let me do it . Maybe my own limitations would n't let me , . either . But I 'd like to find out . But , anyway , as long as I want to do it and keep on trying , I would n't call my state exactly boredom . Divirie discontent  --  yes . I 'm dreary and dejected and slightly dippy  --  but still often exhilarated . If Motherp256would let Dad set me up in a little flat in New York where I could write in peace and live my own life ' Do n't be ridiculous , Cora , ' said Aunt Cora sharply . Then , almost mechanically , What would you do in a flat in New York ? ' The question was very familiar . It was a family joke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sally 's eyes , and Kathleen 's , and Cora 's , met in a triangular glance of cousinly understanding . But Sally , herself ; was not at all sure that Cora 's writing would ever amount to anything . Cora had tried to publish a poem or a short story , now and again , and always in vain . She had never let Sally , or Kathleen either , have a peep at the novel . She kept it in her old desk drawer , where she had kept the rhymes of her childhood , and , like them , under lock and key . But if ; at twenty-nine , Cora wanted to cut loose from the family and go to live in New York , why in Heaven 's name should n't she ? But Granny was looking at her granddaughters in perplexity . I do n't know what 's the matter with all you young people , ' she said slowly . Of course , I have to keep reminding myself that you are n't , any of you , any longer , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I was just Kathleen 's age at the time of the Chicago Fire , and I 'd been married ten years and I 'd had four babies . I thought I was a middle-aged woman '  --  Granny smiled indulgently  --  so of course I was perfectly contentedto stay home and do my work . But then '  --  Granny 's brow was still wrinkled with perplexity  --  I had work to do . Perhaps that 's the greatest difference between us . ' I 'm contented , Granny , ' spoke up Rose quietly , from her seat on the arm of her father 's chair . I feel like a dumb bunny to admit it , in this enterprising group , but I 'm perfectly contentedto live as I do , with Comfort and with Dad . I really have an awfully good time . I ca n't say that I feel middle-aged  --  I do n't think women do feel middle-aged now , until they 're not middle-aged any longer  --  but I 'm thirty-one , and I 'm not a bit bored . I suppose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does n't she , Dad ? ' Mr. MacLeod smiled in answer . Then Rose turned to Sally . Are you bored , Sally ? '  |p257Sally  considered the candid question for a moment in silence . It was almost too candid to be answered with complete equanimity . Well , ' she said finally , I  --  I never admit it . And of course , after Alan 's protestation , gallantry demands that I say I 'm not bored with him ! I 'm really not  --  nor bored with the children . ' Sally 's voice was gaining conviction . But still  --  I see what Alan means . I mean  --  you know  --  we are all getting on , and where is it all getting us ? We just go on , living in Lakewood . Ten years ago we all thought life was going to be exciting . ' Life , ' said Sally 's mother , from her corner by the fire , is n't through with you yet . ' I wish , ' said Kathleen , that I thought that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just around the corner . That the unforeseen would happen . But I do n't . For it never does . ' Oh , yes , ' said Sally 's mother gently , I think it always does , sooner or later , in every life . And then  --  life changes . You change , too . ' Well , you do and you do n't , ' said Granny quite briskly . You deal with what happens to you , according to your lights . ' Sally was thinking how differently her mother and her grandmother had dealt with the death of a beloved son . Granny went on talking cheerfully , as she always did when she felt that Sally 's mother was thinking too sadly of Sam . But I agree that life always holds surprises . I still expect to be surprised , myself , maybe more than once , before I die . I 'm continually surprised at the way I go on living . I 'm surprised at how tough I am . ' In the laughter that that confession evoked , Uncle Fred said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a tough family  --  for all that for so many years we 've had everything so soft . I can feel myself toughening , at any rate , as I grow older . It 's very reassuring . And I can see a strain of toughness  --  oh , very definitely !  --  coming out in each nephew and niece . Baines  --  where is Baines , by the way ? ' He dined in town this evening , ' said Aunt Adelaide placidly . Sally glanced at Cora . No one made further comment . Itf never did , since Baines 's divorce last January , to inquire too closely , in Aunt Adelaide 's presence , into the whereabouts of her son . Well , ' continued Uncle Fred gaily , Baines , Sally , Cora , Kathleen , and Georgie , all clearly reveal , to a loving avuncular eye , their distinct and different strains of toughness . And Sally 's kids are certainly tough ! Those two little roughnecks ! We must get it from you , Mother . ' He fondly surveyed the frail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't be surprised if you were quite the toughest baby in the bunch . ' A discreet sound in the doorway turned Sally 's eyes toward it . Carl , the butler , was standing on the threshold . The telephone for Miss Kathleen , ' ten o'clock , ' observed Sally 's mother . Time means nothing to William , ' said Cora . He has n't called her up today and Old Faithful spouts pretty regular ! ' The family were still laughing when Kathleen came back from the telephone . You lose , ' she remarked to her sister , from the doorway . I guess maybe I 've lost him . It was Maisie . She 's got a gang of people over there , celebrating the election , and she wants us all to come over for a drink . ' Fine ! ' said Georgic , brightening . He seemed momentarily to have forgotten the Socialist State . I would n't mind a drink , ' said Cora meditatively . Me , neither , ' said Alan . Let 's make a night of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't established every day . ' Sally was thinking that it did not require the establishment of a millennium to persuade Maisie to ask people over for a drink . Nine years ago she had christened her French farmhouse The Green Bush , ' and Avery had designed one in hand-wrought iron , painted emerald green , to hang over the front door , in the manner of a French provincial inn , to indicate to a parched generation that good liquor could be found inside . She was also thinking that she was very tired and that she did not particularly care , except when she was on the crest of the wave , for one of Maisie 's uproarious evenings . So ,  |p259Oh  , Alan , ' she said , let 's go home . ' He glanced at her quickly . Why ? ' he asked . Sally felt vaguely irritated . Oh  --  I do n't know . It 's late . We 've been out so much . ' Kathleen seized her hands and pulled her to her feet . Oh , come on ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll likeit when you get there . ' I 've been there before , ' said Sally , rather grimly . God , yes ! ' said Kathleen . But it 's better than nothing . ' You can go home early , ' said Cora . You can , ' said Sally , but you never do . ' We will this time , ' said Alan . Oh  --  all right , ' said Sally , rather ungraciously . Coming , Rose ? ' I guess so , ' said Rose hesitantly . If Dad -- Run along and enjoy yourself , ' said Mr. MacLeod heartily . Kathleen twined her arm around her youngest uncle 's elbow . Coming , Uncle Fred ? ' I 'm too old , ' said Uncle Fred falsely . Listen to him ! ' cried Kathleen . I saw Maisie ogling you , last night , at the Carvers ' dance ! She 's off her last boy friend and I should n't wonder if she were planning to be your next best girl . And some girl , Uncle ! You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked pleased , as he always did , when his nieces bantered him . All right , ' he said . I 'll drive Rose over in my car . ' Fine ! ' said Kathleen . The rest of us can pile in with Alan . Good night everybody ! ' She turned promptly to the door . Good night , mother , ' said Sally . Good night , Granny . It 's swell about the election , is n't it , Dad ? ' Take her home early , Alan , if she 's tired , ' called Sally 's mother . Alan was already in the hall . Kathleen had slipped into her white fur evening wrap . Cora was struggling into her ulster . Uncle Fred gave her a hand . I ca n't say that this coat looks very elegant , ' said Cora apologetically . If I 'd known I was going on to a party  --  '  |p26oCora  still preferred , whenever the occasion permitted , to wear her old clothes . Rose was tying a blue scarf firmly above the Madonna-like parting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , though she professed to admire Kathleen 's golden aureole and Sally 's sleek red shingle and the businesslike , mannish haircut that made Cora 's small , tall head look so strangely like that of a very young , well-bred boy . Alan was holding Sally 's evening wrap . Buck up ! ' he said , in a low voice , as she was slipping into it . Then , rather detachedly , Are you really tired ? ' Oh  --  not really , ' said Sally , with equal detachment . Not more than usual . ' A drink will do you good , ' said Alan firmly . Then Georgic opened the front door and they all stepped out across the porch into the darkness of the November night . The sky was overcast and the air smelled faintly of rain . Smelled , too , of the dead oak leaves that carpeted the copse beyond the garden . The lake was whishing audibly on the beach below the bluff . Across the garden hedge , Sally could see the vague outline of her house roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlined , and the light in the window of the day nursery , which meant that good old Emma was still keeping watch over the boys . Five-year-old Alan had had a touch of croup the day before yesterday , and was sleeping temporarily in the guest room , with a croup kettle burning , so as not to disturb his brother Sam , in the night nursery across the hall . Sam was a big boy now , who brought back home work from the Lakewood Progressive School every night and was much interested in the progress of the Third Grade Project  --  the construction of a miniature Parthenon in ivory soap . Alan 's roadster was parked in the turn-around . He took the wheel and Cora and Kathleen climbed in beside him and Sally and Georgie clambered into the rumble seat behind . Uncle Fred and Rose waved and turned to walk over to the old stable to get Uncle Fred 's new Cadillac . Alan started the car with care . He was a good driver . George 's thoughts had returned to the discussion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your father and mine are dead from the neck up . This talk about prosperity is just the bunk . We 'll never get anywhere until we make a new world . ' Sally did not reply . A new world , ' she was thinking . Why did those words sound so very familiar ? Oh , yes  --  of course . A new world was what Alan and Sam were going to make when they went to France . And a new world was what Alan had said that she and he were off for , when she told him that little Sam was going to be born . A new world , she was thinking , seemed to be a receding goal that slipped elusively away from you before you ever quite touched it . The trouble was , the old world clung about you too pertinaciously to be sloughed off . A poet had said that  --  or something like it . Some poet she had read at Broadmoor-on-Hudson . The world is too much with us ; late and soon , Getting and spending , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , Wordsworth  --  the poet Miss Stackpole so much admired . Cora had said that poem , once , at the Spring Exercises . And she , herself , had said , Gather ye rosebuds , while ye may , Old Time is still a-flying and the school had all laughed at the lines , Then be not coy , but use your time , And while ye may , go marry and she had laughed , too , or almost , on the platform , because she was thinking of Alan and of her secret engagement to him . And she had used her time and she had married him and they had gathered their rosebuds . But now she was thirty years old and they had been married for eleven years and Alan would rather go out to one of Maisie 's parties and drink some of Maisie 's highballs than -- Sally roused herself from reveryand turned to Georgic with a smile . We do need a new world , ' she said , with so much conviction that Georgie felt he had all but made a new convert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ground-floor windows of Maisie 's French farmhouse and the sound of a piano was clearly audible as Alan 's roadster whirled up the drive . Someonewas playing jazz , rather brilliantly , in Avery 's studio at the back of the house . They all jumped out of the car in the gravel rectangle in front of the door , where three motors were parked , and ran up on the low stone doorstep , under the green bush . Alan opened the front door without ceremony . In the hall  --  a lovely , elliptical hall , cream-panelled , with a staircase curving gracefully up and out of it behind an iron rail  --  the sound of the piano was much louder . It was broken by high voices and the somewhat hysterical note of shrill feminine laughter . The Truesdales and MacLeods dropped their wraps on the old French chest at the foot of the staircase , where other wraps were lying , and Kathleen stepped to the mirror hanging over it and carefully re-outlined her thin lips with a vivid stroke of scarlet . Sally slicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own lipstick . There ! ' said Kathleen , smiling seductively at her image in the mirror . The wise virgin is ready for the bridegroom ! ' She slipped her hand through Sally 's arm . Do you know  --  it 's idiotic  --  but I 've never lost my girlish hope that I 'll meet a new man at a party ! ' Led by the sound of the music , they all entered Maisie 's drawing-room at the right-hand side of the door . The room was empty and tranquil . It was large and a little bare . The light from soft shaded lamps shone serenely on Avery 's old French furniture , formally disposed between balanced doors and windows , and gleamed on the polished black floor that framed the priceless rectangle of Maisie 's treasured Aubusson rug . A little fire flickered on the clean-swept hearth beneath the antique marble mantel shelf . Above it a time-dimmed mirror vaguely reflected the empty perfection of the room . It reflected also the casual advance of the five young people , who , led by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pied Piper , sauntered unseeingly through this museum-like perfectionto the swept and garnished dining-room beyond it and onp263to the door of Avery 's studio , which occupied the west wing of the house . With every step of their advance the sound of revelry increased , and on the threshold of the studio it was almostdeafening . The room was long and narrow and terminated , at its farther end , in a little raised platform , on which stood a grand piano , lit by two seven-branched candlesticks , placed near the player 's seat . Avery 's drawing-desk , half-covered with architects ' blueprints , stood by a window near the door . In the centre of the room , in front of a large stone fireplace , where a roaring fire was blazing , was a long refectory table , laden down with plates of sandwiches and bowls of cracked ice and brilliantly coloured glasses and bottles of every conceivable shape and colour . The lights were dim and the hot air was blue with cigarette smoke , and Sally , from the threshold , could at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eight or nine people already in the room . Two large sofas , not far from the fireplace , were occupied by two somewhat hilarious couples . The rest of the party was grouped about the piano on the platform , and on the piano bench , brightly illuminated by the candlelight , sat a young man whom Sally had never seen before . He was , she thought immediately , a very odd young man to see in Avery 's studio . In the first place , he was unmistakably a Jew . He was small and dark and hook-nosed and amazingly vivid and vivacious . His sleek black hair rippled smoothly off his high forehead in shining , symmetrical waves . He was playingextremely good jazz in an extremely casual manner , his hands flying over the keys automatically and yet tenderly , his head tossed back and nodding to accentuate his rhythm , and his narrow , dark eyes gleaming humorously , as he smiled , with a flash of white teeth , at one member or another of his little audience . His expression surprisingly suggested that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or perhaps he was mocking the audience . Sally was not quite sure . From that audience , Billy Bangs almost immediately detachedhimself . He had seen Kathleen at the door . He stepped down off the platform and advanced across the haze of cigarette smoke , his round , bespectacled countenance pleasantly wreathed in a welcoming smile.  | Safe and sane , ' hissed Kathleen in Sally 's ear , even as she mechanically answered that smile . Sally was thinking , funnily enough , of that time , long ago at Aunt Cora 's Christmas dinnerdance , when Billy Bangs had shocked her with his subversive views on the conduct of girls . She was willing to bet that he had never shocked a woman since ! Maisie saw them then , and arose from one of the sofas . The man beside her , Sally saw , was Baines . And the girl by the piano , with her back turned , was Gertrude Sewall  --  Baines 's divorced wife  --  Mrs. Westbrook Sewall . So  --  thought Sally swiftly  --  Baines must have been out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother that he was staying in town . Baines 's marriage , three years before , to Gertrude Westbrook , a very sporting young lady and a famous rider to the hounds at the Lakewood Country Club , had been a great cross to Aunt Adelaide . She could never endure her daughter-inlaw . But the divorce which had followed it , less than two years later , had been even harder to bear . Baines had returned to live under the parental roof at the Rectory , and the divorce was never mentioned by the family in Aunt Adelaide 's presence . It had , however , created a great scandal in the parish , where Uncle Lambert had always steadfastly opposed the dissolution of marriage . Moreover , the scandalmongers had been aggravated , rather than appeased , by its arresting sequel . Gertrudewas no sooner back from Reno , a free woman , than Baines seemed to find her more attractive than ever before . That situation was the last straw that broke the camel 's back of Aunt Adelaide 's patience . She had indignantly forbidden her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife . And Baines  --  too comically , his cousins thought  --  had instantly relapsed into adolescent furtiveness . Cora said it was the subtle influence of the Rectory roof . He saw Gertrude constantly and always clandestinely , slipping secretly out , past Aunt Adelaide 's vigilance , to spend an evening with her at his former fireside , or meeting her at Maisie 's  --  as he was doing this evening  --  for she and Maisie were great friends . As the man rose from the other sofa , Sally saw that he wasp265Avery Caldwell , and the girl beside him was Cicily Lancaster  --  Cicily Carver of old , whom Sally had known from her earliest childhood - the girl who had provided Lakewood with its last spring sensation by running off to Paris to divorce her husband , Jack Bridges  --  such a nice man , too  --  to marry her husband 's sister 's husband , as soon as he got his divorce . The Carvers had hated that marriage , so Sally 's mother said  --  and she was an old friend of Cicily 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the sister-in-law had remarried , and Cicily had come back to Lakewood , after a happy honeymoon , to pick up her three children who had been summering with her mother , to carry them off to China , where her second husband had a job in the legation at Peking . The second husband , a strikingly handsome and very sophisticatedyoung man , whom Sally did not know very well , was standing by the piano at Gertrude Sewall 's elbow , smiling down at the unknown jazz player . The jazz player , however , was not long to remain unknown . My dear , believe it or not , ' Maisie was whispering volubly , his name is Maurice Edelstein , and those who really love him call him Moss ! He 's a Broadway Boy  --  a composer and a conductor . Avery picked him up last month in New York . They were week-ending together at a house that Avery had done , out at Great Neck , and Edelstein fell for the decor . He actually gave Avery an order to design him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course Avery 's never had a thing to do with the theatre and he 's perfectly thrilled . He 's been working like a dog on them . Edelstein 's here on his way to Hollywood . So Avery asked him out for the night . Of course , he 's a sketch  --  but he 's really quite attractive . Very funny  --  and you can hear how talented . Come over and meet him . ' While Maisie was speaking the music had ceased . As she led Sally and Kathleen and Cora to the piano , Maurice Edelstein was rising to his feet . Oh  --  you must n't stop , Mr. Edelstein ! ' she cried prettily . Except for a minute , while I get you another highball ! In the meantime , I want to present you to Mrs. MacLeod and to Miss Truesdale and to Miss Kathleen Truesdale . That 's Alan MacLeod and Georgic Truesdale , hovering with Avery over the drinks . ' Maurice Edelstein stood up very straight beside the piano bench , making the most of every inch of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Sally 's hand . Cora towered head and shoulders above him . He had to tip his head back , just a little , to meet the level gaze of Kathleen 's calm blue eyes . He did meet it , however , for a perceptible instant . Then , I wish you 'd go on playing , ' said Kathleen impulsively . I 've never heard anyone play jazz so well . ' As she spoke , Billy Bangs turned up again at her elbow . Then I will , ' said Maurice Edelstein , in his turn impulsively . He sat down on the piano bench and flashed up at Kathleen one of his mocking smiles . I will  --  if you 'll talk to me while I 'm playing . The trouble with all these people is  --  they listen while I play . I 'm not Paderewski . My kind of music is meant to conceal the finer nuances of conversation . It 's really an accompaniment  --  or perhaps a social screen . ' Maisie came up with a highball , as he spoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were again drifting idly over the keys . I never thought of music like that , ' said Kathleen , as an accompaniment to conversation . ' Maurice Edelstein was looking up at her . So much of conversation , do n't you think , is better not overheard ? ' Not my conversation ! ' said Cora brightly . Neither Edelstein nor her sister paid any attention to her . Do you like this ? ' he asked . His fingers had slipped into a definite and rather haunting melody . It 's from my new show . ' Suddenly he began softly to sing . When you met me , When I met you , We did n't know what we would do Kathleen sat suddenly down beside him on the piano bench . Did you write the words ? ' she asked . Sally was surprised by the childlike expression of interest on her face . Edelstein nodded , still singing and smiling.  |p267You  did n't know , I did n't say , I was afraid you 'd run away ' Sally heard Billy Bangs sigh . Cora heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand consolingly through Billy 's arm . Come get me a highball , Bill , ' she said and led him from the platform . Edelstein 's voice was going softly on . But now we know , That , come what may , You  --  have  --  entered  --  my  --  life  --  to  --  stay Avery 's hand touched Sally 's elbow . Maisie was greeting Uncle Fred and Rose at the door . Come and have a drink , ' said Avery persuasively . As Sally turned from the piano with him , Maurice Edelstein 's low , tender tenor was still singing his banal Broadway words to his curiously haunting tune . For you love me , And I love you , And we have discovered that  --  dreams  --  come  --  trueSally walked with Avery over to the sofa where Cicily Lancasterwas still sitting . Cicily patted the cushions with her hand . Sally , darling , ' she said , I 'm so glad you came over this evening . I want to talk to you before I run off to Peking . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano . She was throwing a capable hostess 's eye over her assembled guests . Albert Lancaster had joined his wife and Avery and Sally on the sofa . On the sofa opposite , Baines and Gertrude Sewall were comfortably , almost conjugally , established with their highballs . Billy , tall glass in hand , had wandered miserablyback onto the platform with Cora . He was watching Kathleenand Edelstein with despondent eyes . Georgie , at the table , was syphoning a squirt of fizzy water into a drink . Alan , at his elbow , was taking one straight . Maisie picked up Georgie , as she passed , and left him , after a moment , standing with Cora and Billy and Uncle Fred and Rose around the grand piano. 268 WITHIN THIS PRESENTp268She walked back to the table to carry them a tray of drinks . The room had relapsed into a dim , conversational din . Maurice Edelstein was still singing . Nevertheless , Sally could hear what Maisie said to Alan as she rejoined him and set the tray back on the table . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his girl and his liquor it 's not my fault . But we seem to be the ugly orphans . Nobody loves us ! Come , talk to me , Alan , over there in the corner , and try to appear as if I were fascinating you . It would be so good for Avery to feel that you were fascinated by his wife ! ' They strolled away together and Sally 's eyes turned back to Cicily at her side . The half highball she had consumed was alreadymaking her brain feel a little fuzzy . But that was because she was so tired . She tried to concentrate on what Cicily was saying . She was evidently talking of her honeymoon . Oh , we had the most heavenly time ! And I did n't really miss the children after the first wrench at leaving them . That was awful , of course . But they are always so happy , here at Lakewood , with Mumsy . And Mumsy simply dotes on them . Of course she has n't anything else to do . I worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big house . This is good Scotch , Avery . ' Cicily 's tone was that of a connoisseur . You bet it is , ' said Avery . I got it from Tim . ' Tim ? ' questioned Cicily . Yes . Timothy O'Hara . ' Do I know him ? ' asked Cicily . I do n't seem to Oh ! ' said Avery . Perhaps you do n't . We all know him so well that I forget that everyone does n't . But Albert does  --  or he used to . You remember O'Hara , Albert , of the EightySixth  --  up at Rockford ? ' Albert Lancaster knitted his handsome brows . Do I ? Oh , yes ! Of course I do . But I never knew him well . I was a care-free bachelor in those days . Never saw much of the married set . ' Well , we knew him , ' pursued Avery . He lived in the same boarding-house with Alan and Sally and Maisie and me . He 's turned bootlegger. '  |p269Cicily  gave a little squeal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! You do n't actually know  --  I mean know  --  a bootlegger ? How screamingly funny ! ' You bet we do . ' Do you know him , Sally ? ' Sally nodded soberly . Yes . His wife is one of my best friends . ' How simply enchanting ! ' cried Cicily gaily . Tell me what they 're like ! ' Why , they 're just like everyone else , ' said Sally rather unwillingly . She did not care to hold Tim and Bee up to scorn . Except they 're rather nicer . They have four cute children . They live out in a little bungalow on the northwest side . ' But , darling  --  you know what I mean  --  with machine guns in the window ? ' No . With a Boston fern in the window , ' said Sally rather tersely . How in the world did he happen to turn bootlegger ? ' asked Albert Lancaster with interest . Avery considered the question . Well , how did he , Sally ? You know them better than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the War he came down to Chicago to seek his fortune and I guess he just drifted into the profession where fortunes are quickly made . His father was a contractor , so he had a toe-hold in the building trades . The labor unions are all mixed up with the liquor traffic . He was interested in it . I mean he was really interested . He thought the Eighteenth Amendment was unconstitutional from the first . He thought that the bootlegging industry was an important part of our constitutional guarantee of life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . He always says the bootleggers class right up with the bankers as protectors of the status quo . And I guess he thinks that the bootleggers , like the bankers , have a right to all they can make on the side . ' How fantastic ! ' commented Cicily . Like Sally 's father , her own was a banker . Sally felt goaded to defence . Oh , I do n't know ! ' she said airily . I ca n't see that it 's any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alan to buy it . It takes two to make that crime . ' But , my dear , ' said Cicily , does he go about killing people , right and left ? Taking them for rides and putting them on the spot and all the rest of it ? I think this is perfectly thrilling ! ' Of course he does n't ! ' said Sally indignantly . And Avery backed her up . Oh , Tim 's a good business man , but he would n't hurt a fly . And he does n't have to kill . He 's in with Red Kelly 's gang and they have pretty close affiliations with Joe Tonetti 's outfit in Detroit . They 're a strong bunch and they always get good liquor . It 's extremely convenient to have Tim for a friend . ' I should think it would be , ' commented Albert Lancaster dryly . If I were n't off for Peking ; I 'd ask for an introduction . ' How long do you think you 'll be in Peking ? ' asked Avery politely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My boss was a Coolidge appointment , so this election meant a lot to me . If Smith had got in , I suppose every under-secretary in the Orient would have lost his job to some Catholic wardheeler  --  ' Sally leaned back against the cushions and finished her highballand wished that she could shut her eyes . If she did , she knew she 'd be asleep in a minute . Why did anyone think that parties like this were fun ? Gertrude Sewall 's head was actually on Baines 's shoulder . Avery was refilling Cicily 's glass . What did Maisie mean , taking Alan off in a corner ? Did she mean anything ? Sally could not see them without turning her head . She would not turn it , she thought stoutly . She would not turn it for a million dollars . But what was a million dollars ? She would not turn it if , by the turning , she could bring Alan back to her side . Not even for that . She did not want Alan at her side if he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not true . She did , of course . But why ? Perhaps only because it was humiliating to be , at a party , the kind of wife whose husband was off philandering with another girl . Vanity . If it were really only vanity , that ought to release Alan from all conjugal obligations . But , of course , it did n't  --  at least it did only in anp271ideally moral world . In the real world , she and Alan were securelymarried and they had two small sons , and if they did n't look out their marriage might go just the way Maisie 's and Avery 's marriage was going . Slipping and sliding  --  held together by convention and convenience . Alan , of course , knew Maisie for what she was . Still Oh , why did n't she let himalone ? Say when , Sally . ' It was Avery 's voice and he was standing over her with the bottle of Tim 's Scotch . She ought not to take another . Her mind was already vague . But  --  how could you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning if you were cold sober ? When ! ' said Sally briefly . Avery came back with the White Rock . Albert Lancaster 's hand was lying loosely , yet caressingly , on his wife 's knee . Albert and Cicily represented the next stage , Sally thought as she sipped her highball  --  the one beyond Maisie and Avery  --  in a modern marriage . They had each left a perfectly good marital partner to marry the other . She and Alan . Maisie and Avery . Cicily and Albert . Boredom . Curiosity . The smash-up and the new deal . Like a set of Hogarth prints . Marriage a la mode ! You only thought thoughts like this , Sally reflected dizzily , when you were a little tight . When the room was hot . And you could n't breathe for cigarette smoke . And you were tired . And your eyes were closing . Sally suddenly sat up very straight . Give me a sandwich , Avery , ' she said clearly . Her voice sounded loud in her own ears . Like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserver . Avery presented the little silver salver . Anchovy  --  she hated it . Shrimps  --  they were disgusting . Caviar  --  that was better . Little shiny black eggs of caviar , dusted over with the grated yellow of egg . Sally took three sandwiches and ate them greedily . How many potential sturgeon , she wondered  --  and at least one chicken  --  had perished in embryo , in order that she might feel a little less tight ? She did feel less tight , though . Her head was clearing . It was rather pleasant  --  this being a trifle vague . Maurice Edelsteinhad abandoned his jazz . He was rattling off Gilbert andp272Sullivan . He had persuaded the people around the piano to sing . So  --  give three cheers And one cheer more , For the gal-lant captain of the Pin-a-foreThe noise was deafening , but at least you did n't have to talk . Maurice Edelstein 's wiry fingers fell on the keys with a crash of comic chords . He is an Eng-lish-man ! For  --  he him-self has said it , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is  --  an Eng-lish-man ! He might have been a Roo-sian , A French , or Turk , or Proo-sian , Or per-haps I-tal-i-an The song ended breathlessly , in a burst of laughter . In the silence that followed , Maurice Edelstein 's fingers were toying , tinklingly , with another little tune . It was the song the Fairy Queen sang in Iolanthe , ' when she sank beneath her station and outraged the Fairy Law by falling in love with a mortal  --  the sentry in his sentry box in the Westminster Palace Yard . Edelsteinwas looking at Kathleen , still beside him on the piano bench , and laughing a little . Kathleen 's eyes were fixed on the music in the piano rack . Sally could see , however , from the curve of her smiling lips and the light in her shining eyes , that she was well aware of Maurice Edelstein 's gaze . Suddenly , in her light and slightly faltering contralto , she began to sing the song . The words sounded startlingly soft and clear , after the uproarthat had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading the lyric as she sang . She did not look away from the music . Oh , foolish fay , Think you , because His brave array My bosom thaws , I 'll disobeyOur fairy laws ? '  |p273Kathleen  did not look unlike a fairy , Sally thought , so slim and pale in her white evening gown , with her fair , fly-away hair , spun gold in the yellow candlelight , fluffed out around her thin , slightly elfin face . A derisive fairy , like Gilbert and Sullivan'sown . Her lips were curled mockingly as she sang . Because I flyIn realms above , In tendencyTo fall in love , Resemble IThe amorous dove ? ' It really sounded as if Kathleen were asking that question about herself , of her audience . Second verse ! ' commanded Edelstein , ignoring his expectant chorus . Kathleen 's voice shook a little , but she continued to sing , turning from the music now , to smile ironically , straight into Edelstein 's eyes . On fire that glows With heat intense , I turn the hose Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! We must maintain Our fairy law -- She broke down at that , laughing . The broken line seemed somehow a challenge , flung at the admiring Edelstein 's feet . lie took it up , promptly , head tossed back , fingers flying , with the mournful recitative of the unhappy Lord Chancellor . Something subtly triumphant , however , in the manner of his delivery , counteracted the mock-melancholy of the song . Love , unrequited , robs me of my rest ; Love , hopeless love , my ardent soul encumbers ! Love , nightmare like , lies heavy on my chest ; And weaves itself into my midnight slumbers ! ' It was like a charade , Sally thought , a musical charade , and that young man was undoubtedly talented . Kathleen looked so very much amused . She looked as she had not looked for years  --  as if she were having a good time . Then Maurice Edelstein 's hands crashed into another rollicking chorus and the singers began to shout again , Hail ! Hail ! The gang 's all here ! What the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former pandemonium . Turn out the lights , Alan , ' said Sally wearily . She was walking ahead of her husband up her hall stair . She paused on the landing to glance down at the clock near the door . The hands stood at twenty minutes after two . Alan was hanging up his hat and overcoat in the hall closet . They had just left the Truesdales at Aunt Cora 's white-porticoed door , Georgie slightly exhilarated , Cora morose and sleepy , and Kathleen very wide-awake but curiously silent , after Maisie 's party . Alan emerged from the coat closet with a sigh . He , too , glanced at the hall clock . Good Lord ! Is that the time ? ' You bet it is , ' said Sally briefly . And the eight o'clock train pulls out in less than six hours . ' Alan 's voice was resentful . I ca n't stand this pace , Sally . ' Sally not unnaturally felt that his resentment was unreasonable . Well  --  whose idea was it to go to this party ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment Sally continued , ' I would n't care if I never went to a party at Maisie 's again . ' Alan turned out the hall light . The stairs were dimly lit from the corridor above . His voice came up to her out of the darkness . Oh  --  Maisie 's all right . ' She 's not so very right , ' said Sally rather tartly . In fact , I think she 's usually wrong . She has n't any sense . ' I think she 's not very happy , ' said Alan . Sally 's eyes , by this time , were accustomed to the darkness . She could see as well as hear him starting up the stairs . I suppose she told you that , ' said Sally.  |p275No  . She did n't , ' said Alan . She was just talking about Avery . But I could see it for myself . ' What did she say about Avery ? ' demanded Sally . What fools men were , she was thinking  --  the best of men ! Oh  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice sounded slightly annoyed . She said that architecture was his life . So many people are building houses now , and night after night he stays in town at the office , while she -- Well , what does she do ? ' asked Sally . She goes out with a boy friend to dance at the Country Club , or stages an orgy like that one tonight . ' By this time Alan had reached the stair landing . Just the same , ' he said , I think she 's lonely . No children andWhose fault is it that she has no children ? ' demanded Sally again , almost involuntarily . She did not entirely understand , herself , the obscure sources of her irritation . I do n't know , ' said Alan coolly . Sally 's irritation increased . Maisie 'd pass out if she had to have a baby . ' She said tonight , ' said Alan , that Avery did not want children , because he liked to be free to run over to Paris at least once a year . ' She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ? ' began Sally . Then checked herself , in dismay . This was perfectlyridiculous  --  quarrelling with Alan over Maisie Caldwell . She turned slowly to ascend the stairs . Alan followed her in silence . Sally walked down the upper corridor and paused at the night-nursery door . She turned the knob noiselessly and entered the room . As the door opened , a sudden draft swept in from the half open window , bringing with it the cool , damp scent of the November night . She could see the curtains dimly , swaying out in the darkness . She groped her way quietly to Sam 's bed . As she did so , Alan 's figure appeared on the threshold , silhouettedagainst the light in the upper hall . She heard his cautiousfootfalls on the floor behind her . Suddenly there was a slight crash.  | Damn ! ' whispered Alan . Laughter shook in his voice . He had stumbled over Sam 's Meccano set , left where Sam always did leave it , in the centre of the night-nursery rug . Sally giggled contagiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arm . Side by side they stood , looking down at Sam 's sleeping figure . He 's so big , ' whispered Sally . Then leaned over to tuck the blankets more firmly around Sam 's stout little pyjama-ed shoulder . Sam had recently graduated to pyjamas from the Arnold nightgown , ' and whenever Sally looked at him in them she felt she had almost a grown son . He stirred a little in his sleep , moving his tumbled red head restlessly on the pillow . He did not look at all like the handsome young uncle for whom he had been named . Both Sally 's boys were red-headed , like their mother , and blue-eyed , like their father , and freckled-nosed , as all red-headed little boys should be . Sam 's hair , like Sally 's , was a deep , bright auburn  --  the hair that came from Granny  --  but little Alan 's was lighter , almost molasses colour in the sunlight . Mr. MacLeod always said with satisfaction that he was a sandy Scot . Alan and Sally tiptoed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the guest room . Their quarrel was as if it had never been . That stumble and that giggle in the darkness had turned the trick . Sally softly opened the guestroomdoor . The clean , acrid smell of benzoin , boiling in the croup kettle , instantly assailed their nostrils . The windows were tightly shut , as the best modern croup treatment demanded , and the croup kettle , above its tiny blue flame , was singing softly on the table . Little Alan , at any rate , looked reassuringly little , in the long expanse of the nearest twin guest-room bed . Little and soft and cuddly in his Arnold nightgown . ' On the pillow beside him lay his rag-doll Highlander , Young Lochinvar , that his Aunt Rose had given him and without which he would never go to sleep . He looks fine , ' whispered Alan . Sally 's hand was feeling her son 's forehead , under his shock of sandy hair . He is fine , ' she said . No fever at all . '  |p277Her  eyes met Alan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness . She squeezed his elbow forgivingly . She felt almost ready to forgive Maisie  --  almost ready to ask for forgiveness herself . Maisie did not know what she had missed , not having any children . Perhaps she was not happy . Sally felt that she had been unreasonable . It was comparatively easy to keep a marriagefrom slipping and sliding when there was a croup kettle in the house.  |p278SALLY  and Beatrice O'Hara were sitting out on Sally 's grass terrace which overlooked the garden , watching little Sam and Alan and Comfort MacLeod and little Timothy and Gloria and Terence and Martin O'Hara , at play on the Sewall lawn . Sally was thinking that she would not have believed it possible that such a piercing volume of sound could issue from seven small throats . The children were climbing the pine tree , which Sally had climbed in her childhood . At least Sam and Comfort and Timothy and Gloria were climbing it and shrieking as they climbed . The three younger children were watching them enviously from below . Old Emma , Sally 's nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mending-basket on her knees . The May sunshine was still a trifle cool , but the flowering white hawthorn and the pink bloom of the crabapple and the tender tan buds of the oak trees were so lovely in the copse , and the tulips and the daffodils and the crocuses so gay in the garden , that Sally and Bee could not bear to sit indoors . Tim had motored his wife and his children , that May Saturday , on their annual spring pilgrimage to have luncheon with Sally . He had business in Milwaukee himself , and was coming to pick them up again on his way back to town . Little Tim will certainly break his neck , ' said Sally uneasily . The old pine tree , at the moment , seemed positively alive with the limber , swaying limbs of little children . Bee did not stir from her chair . He will not . If little Tim 's neck was n't made of rubber , it would have been broken long ago . He has a charmed life , like his father . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Sally curiously . Alan was always telling her that she worried too much herself . A faint shadow seemed to pass , for an instant , over Bee 's tranquil , good-natured face . That face looked a little matronly , now , as did Bee 's square-cut figure , but the smile that lit herp279black eyes and wrinkled her short nose was exactly the same as it had been eleven years before in Mrs. Higgins 's boardinghouse . Well  --  I do n't worry much about the children , ' said Bee . Taking care of four kids under eleven does n't give you much time for worry . Since Terence has gone to kindergarten , though , I 've had more time to myself . The idler you are , I think , the more things bother you . I find myself looking for trouble , now , that I used to be well content to let look after itself . ' What sort of trouble ? ' asked Sally with interest . Bee , for a moment , did not reply . She sat in silence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the terrace edge . Then , Well , you know , Sally , ' she said diffidently , I was never so very keen on Tim 's line of business . ' Her eyes were still on the flowers . I know you were n't , ' said Sally . And his father was never keen on it , either . And my mother was dead against it from the first . But you know Tim  --  he was never a man that could be driven . And he had his way to make and the cost of living was high and there was n't much doing in the building trade , those first years after the War . ' The hint of brogue was creeping into Bee 's voice , as it always did under stress of any emotion . I know , ' said Sally . Bee looked at her then . When we came down to Chicago with little Tim , it was n't such easy sledding . And Tim 's father had four younger children to bring up and educate . And my mother left a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money , though , that made Tim go in for it . It was the excitement . Things seemed so slow to him , at home , after the War . Of course the money was nice and it came in pretty easy . Pretty easy from the very first . And the other babies came along  --  and you know babies cost money Indeed they do , ' said Sally . And Tim was never contented unless our babies had the280 WITHIN THIS PRESENTp280best . Pretty soon he was able to help his father at home and do a little for my mother . He raised the mortgage on her house in Kenosha and he practically educated his brothers and sisters . The eldest is a graduate of Notre Dame . He 's got a sister trainingnow to be a professional dancer  --  she 's a little beauty  --  and his youngest brother wants to go to Princeton in another year . But Tim 's father says that 's full of blue-bellied Presbyteriansand he 'd rather he went to some good Catholic school . I do n't know ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good came out of evil . If it was evil . Father Delaney said it was . He 's always telling Tim he ought to snap out of it and settle down to some respectable trade . But Tim wo n't listen to him , though he 's never broken with the Church . I do n't think Tim would give up the liquor business , now , if he did n't make a cent out of it . He has an awfully good time . There 's always something doing , you know , and it is exciting . Tim takes it like a game and they play for high stakes  --  for all that Red Kelly is n't one of the kings of the industry . He has a nice little business , with a good turn-over , and he holds it together . He does n't look for trouble . Tim thinks a lot of Red Kelly . He 's agood guy  --  but , still -- Still what ? ' asked Sally , when Bee 's voice had definitely died into silence . Oh , I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . When Tim first went into it , Red Kelly used to have things all his own way in his own territory . No one thought of muscling in . He knew all his own men and he knew Joe Tonetti 's crowd in Detroit and they worked together and they worked on the level . When they 'd fixed the police , that was all they had to do . And the police were on the level , too . They never double-crossed them . But now it 's all different . The competition 's getting fierce . There 's a lot of men in the liquor business that do n't belongthere . These murders  --  I think they 're terrible . Tim says for one murderer that 's in it , there 's a hundred honest men . But Red Kelly 's getting mixed up with a lot of wops and sheenies that I would n't trust around the corner . I wish he 'd let the beer racket alone . They 're making plenty off the hard liquor they get from their regular channels . They 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 's the use of trying to spread out ? ' Well , what is ? ' asked Sally , with interest . She was highly amused by Bee 's simple description of the Grand Old Men who had founded the bootlegging industry and she was always fascinated by Bee 's incredible contact with this other world . Search me ! ' said Bee . But you know how men are . They got to have power . Tim says they have to keep the status quo . If they give an inch , he says the Salvatoris will take a mile . You remember Tito Salvatori  --  that threw the pineapple under the alderman 's front porch last fall ? He 's doing time for it now , but he 's got three brothers keeping his seat warm for him until he gets out . They 're Sicilians and , believe me , they mean business . I tell Tim if I saw a Salvatori wanting anything I 'd got , I 'd decide it was about time for me to throw that thing away . But that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Red Kelly 's a fighting Irishman . Red Kelly goes around now with a bodyguard , you know . Been doing it for six months . I do n't like that . It stands to reason that , when men have guns on the hip , they may fire them off . And Red Kelly 's no killer . ' But Bee , ' said Sally , I would n't let that worry me . Red Kelly 's not Tim . ' No , ' said Bee thoughtfully . Tim 's never even carried a gun . 1 ic 's proud of that . He likes to have it known . Two-fisted Tim , they call him , over at Kelly 's . Well , that was all right when the liquor traffic was in its infancy . It used to be just about as dangerous as the dairy business . But now  --  there 's too much money in it . Times have changed . I wish Tim would get out . Ile 's made his pile and , thanks to Alan , we got it safely invested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ninety-two , if you reckon the split-up , is over four hundred now . I 'd like to move off somewhere , far away  --  out on the coast , maybe , or down to Florida  --  and raise oranges and lemons for the nation 's drinks . Let some other fellow providethe gin ! ' What do the children think about it ? ' asked Sally . Little Tim 's old enough to They do n't know a thing , ' said Bee very firmly . Tim saysp282that 's hypocritical and we ought to tell them . He is n't a bit ashamed of what he 's done . But I do n't want them to know their father is a bootlegger . I ca n't help feeling just a little  --  a little self-conscious about it . As if it was something you 'd have to explain . In a way , I think Tim feels a shade that way , too  --  though he 'd never admit it . At least , he works out there in Cicero , but he would n't live there . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be good for the kids . None of the neighbours know exactly what Tim does . And they do n't care much . He just goes off to his work , like any other man , in the morning , and they 're all so busy making money lately and buying new cars and adding on to the garage , that they do n't bother much about other people . Times are certainly good . ' They certainly are , ' said Sally , with a little sigh . Well  --  what are you sighing for ? ' asked Bee . Sally in her turn sat a moment in silence . Then , Oh , Bee , I 'm worried about Alan ! ' she said . Bee 's face grew warm with sympathy . Is n't it the truth a woman can always worry about her husband ? What 's wrong with Alan ? ' she asked . I do n't know , ' said Sally seriously . It 's hard to put your finger on it . But he 's awfully restless . I guess he 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him up . ' If he has to have excitement , ' said Bee simply , what 's he doing , working in a bank ? ' Sally laughed at that . You ought to get together with Granny , Bee , ' she said . Your ideas on banking coincide . She thinks it 's dreadful , the way they 're carrying on at the Farmers ' Loan and Trust Company . She does n't approve of all this commercial banking . She says they 're turning the bank into a department store . She says you can buy almost anything in it , at five times what it 's worth . ' What kind of things ? ' asked Bee . She knew as little of bankingas Sally did of bootlegging . Oh  --  stocks and bonds and real estate and skyscrapers  --  acres of unfinished subdivisions and whole blocks of buildingsp283in the " Loop . " Uncle George is in real estate , you know , and he 's got the bank interested in financing the subdivisions . They 've bought miles of property out at the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in cement sidewalks and iron lamp-posts and staked out little lots and they 've tied little fluttering red flags to all the stakes .

" Chicago Hill Gardens  --  the Home You Want to Have . Ten dollars down and the rest in easy payments . Light . Water . Heat . Schools . Sewers . Race Restrictions . And Lightning Transit to the Loop "  --  on one of Mr. Insull 's North Shore " Els . " Daddy motored Granny out to look at it one Sunday , and she was perfectly horrified . She said there was n't any hill and there were n't any gardens , so it was false advertising , and she said it was immoral to encourage people to spend the money they had n't got and it was immoral to invest other people 's money , which the bank held in trust , in purely speculative enterprise . But Daddy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Granny 's almost eighty-five and I 'm sure I do n't understand it very well myself . ' I do n't blame you , ' said Bee . It sounds all right to me . That 's the way everybody 's buying his lot , nowadays . But how does it affect Alan ? ' Oh  --  he 's so busy , you know . And  --  and just crazy . The bank 's mixed up with everything in the world . Railroads and public utilities and steamship lines and hotels and apartment houses and farm mortgages . But Granny thinks railroads and farm mortgages are all right . She says my grandfather had great confidence in them . Well  --  Alan 's up to the ears in everything . And of course they 're all wild over the market . Mr. MacLeod says it 's just begun to go up . Alan 's got so he does n't sleep very well , so he wo n't go to bed early . And you know how it is , Bee , when you stay up late  --  you go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . I feel just the way you do about it . Alan 's made his pile and we have it safely invested . 1'ci like to go far away  --  to the south of France , maybe , and take a house on the Mediterranean , and stay there a couple ofp284years . Let the children learn French and really see something of Alan . Do things together , the way we used to , before life got so hectic . But Alan wo n't hear of it . He says he ca n't get away . It 's almost pathological , because he really does n't like what he does . You say Tim has an awfully good time . Well - - Alan does n't . And surely he ought to . I feel the years are going by so fast . What are we getting out of life  --  ? ' The sound of a motor horn on the driveway interrupted Sally . That 'll be Tim , ' said Bee . Then , Come , children ! ' she called . Tim 's always in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't he wait to see Alan ? ' said Sally eagerly . He 'll be so disappointed . He 's coming out on the four-fifteen . On Saturday he always lunches at the Chicago Club . He used to get out early to play with the boys , but lately --  ' As shespoke , Timothy O'Hara appeared around the corner of the house , at the edge of the terrace steps . That 's where you are ! ' he said , smiling broadly . Well , Sally , I bet you 've given Bee a good time . She always loves to get out here and have a gossip with you . What have you been talking about ? ' Well , what do you think ? ' said Bee , looking up at him . What would we be talking about but you and Alan ? We 've been saying what poor fish you are . ' Tim grinned . Is Alan around ? ' he asked . He is n't , Tim , ' said Sally apologetically . He 's still in town . But he 's coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I brought him a present . I put it on the front steps . It 's a case of champagne and I think he 'll like it -- Oh , Tim ! You 're too generous ! ' cried Sally gratefully . Tim shrugged his shoulders . I picked it up in Milwaukee . They 're overstocked there at the moment . Say , Sally , your place looks grand ! ' He sat down , as he spoke , in a wicker armchair , and looked over the tulippiedgarden-beds and the stretch of green lawn to the oakfringedbluff and , beyond it , to the pale blue line of lake.  |p285Sally  gazed up at the spring sky through the budding boughs of an elm tree . ' Amy Lowell says , " May is much sunshine through small leaves , " ' she observed . Tim did not answer and , after a moment , Sally glanced at him curiously . He was watching the children , dropping down now from the pine tree , and his lips were twisted in an indulgent smile . He looked tired , Sally thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black hair had receded a little from his high forehead , leaving the temples bare . That made him seem slightly , but only slightly , older , and it added to the Hibernian cast of his features . He had that folk look , Sally thought , that so many young Irishmen have , something robust and humorous and kindly  --  like an Irish Player  --  something strangely akin to the stones and the peat bogs and the tumbleclownhuts of his father 's native land . But Tim looked prosperous . And not at all like a bootlegger . Suddenly he spoke . ' Those kids are having a better time than we had , Bee , ' he said . ' Oh , I do n't know , ' his wife answered . ' The streets of Kenoshawere pretty good fun . There was a pear tree in Mother 's side yard we used to climb -- 'Yes , ' said Tim , ' but we were always feeling we had to get ahead . As a boy I felt it . I had to make good . Else why had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet , as he spoke . ' Well , Sally , I 've got to be pushing on . Hi , Tim ! Terence ! Come , Gloria ! Bring Martin with you ! ' The children came running and tumbling over the lawn . The four little O'Haras were all black-haired and monkey-faced , though Gloria 's black eyes and beguilingly short upper lip showed promise of future beauty . The red-haired MacLeods looked very blond beside them . Comfort MacLeod was a blue-eyed , pink-cheeked little girl , with straight tan hair parted so that the part neatly bisected her small round head and confinedin two stubby tan pigtails behind her ears . Sally never thought of her as an adopted child . She might easily have been , in her young , blonde healthiness , young Sam 's and Alan 's sister . Gloria was the first to reach the terrace.  | Shame on you , Gloria , ' said Bee conventionally , you 've got pine tar all over your clean smock ! Tim , your hands are a sight ! Shake hands , now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've had a fine time . ' Are they going home ? ' asked Sam , disappointment in his voice . They 've got to go , darling , ' said Bee . But you must come in and see us . Come to lunch some Saturday in our little bungalow and we 'll all go out to a neighbourhood movie . Have you seen Charlie Chaplin in " The Circus "  --  ? ' Sally walked with the O'Hara family to her front door . She stood by the case of champagne and watched them all climb into Tim 's scarlet Stutz . It looks like a fire engine , I tell him ! ' called Bee cheerfully . And it runs like one , too , ' said Tim , with satisfaction . The Stutz was a chaos of little waving , dirty hands as it rolled off down the drive . Sally remained on her doorstep , looking down her leafy avenue , after it had disappeared . She was thinking that Bee was a darling and that she was obviously very happy with Tim and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bootlegging industry and go to live in the country as Bee wished to do . What real future was there for a bootlegger 's children in the city of Chicago ? And the children were so nice . Bee had brought them up well . And Tim adored them . And Tim adored Bee . Bee had told her the truth , she knew , about all that was worrying her . Sally sighed , rather heavily , as she thought of the truth that she herself had not told . It was more than business that was worrying Alan . It was more than businessthat was worrying her . Alan was bored with life in his house in the garden . He was bored with the life that he found outside it . He did not really like the things the crowd did that they ran with in Lakewood . Yet he was never contented to stay at home . Day after day , night after night , the telephone rang  --  and it was usually Maisie . Maisie  --  with some new plan of how to kill a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a dead set for Alan , all winter long , and she ought to be ashamed of herself . For Alan was a family man . He had never racketed about with other girls and women -- p287Little Alan was tugging at her hand . Here comes Cousin Cora ! ' he cried . Cora , indeed , was strolling through the garden . She waved , as Sally looked at her and advanced to the terrace steps . Bee gone ? ' she asked . Yes , ' said Sally . Alan get out ? ' No , ' said Sally . I thought he would n't , ' said Cora . That man 's a working fool . What are you doing ? ' Thinking , ' said Sally briefly . Do n't , ' said Cora , with equal brevity . That wo n't get you anywhere . At least if you were thinking of your own problems . It 's only on other people 's problems that thinking does any good . Come and think with me , on Kathleen 's . ' She dropped down , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her long legs out in the May sunshine and ran both hands , a little wearily , over her smooth , short hair . What 's wrong with Kathleen ? ' asked Sally . She sat down lierself , on the terrace steps . The children were running back to Emma under the pine tree . Cora looked at her moodily , for a moment , in silence . Then , I think she 's really in love with that Jew , ' she said . Sally leaned over and picked a yellow tulip and beganflattening its petals out to show its inner red and russet marking . After a moment , Well  --  I dare say she is , ' she assented . But what of it ? It will blow over . Kathleen 's thought she was in love with people before . ' But she was n't , ' said Cora earnestly . She really never was . Slie was just trying to be . And now she 's trying not to be . It 's a very different thing . ' Yes , ' said Sally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't see much of him . ' No , ' said Cora . But he never lets her alone . He comes , now and then , to Chicago , though he never stays more than a day or two . He flew twice , and only stayed a few hours . He telel ) lionesfrom New York and from Hollywood , simply regardless.  |p288And  he telegraphs . Good Lord , Sally , do you know how they telegraph on Broadway ? He positively wires letters . They look like sheets of yellow wall-paper  --  blank after blank , pasted together . And I wish you could see Kathleen when she reads them ! She laughs like a fool  --  he 's funny as a crutch , you know  --  and looks so wild and excited . And she keeps them all . Now , fancy , keeping a telegram ! She keeps them under lock and key . ' What does Aunt Cora say ? ' asked Sally . She must know about it . ' Well  --  she does n't know all , but what she does know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear leer carry on ! I sometimes think if she 'd shut up , Kathleen would get over it . Though of course he 's putting up an awfully good fight . A bombardment like that would flatter any girl . Kathleen'shad her moments , but no man ever laid siege to her in this big way before . He 's simply indefatigable and he 's perfectlymad about her . Nicely mad  --  if you know what I mean . That 's the queer thing about it . Here he is  --  just a  --  a Broadway riot  --  and he 's really nicer than any man Kathleen ever knew before . Not nicer than Billy Bangs , of course . Billy 's niceness is as proverbial as it is pathetic . But , believe it or not , Maurice Edelstein , the jazz boy , is nice in exactly the same way . ' I suppose the answer is , ' said Sally soberly , that they both really love her . ' Yes , ' said Cora doubtfully , but it 's something more than that . They both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And they ca n't help showing it . They show it in every little thing they do . ' It 's funny to think , ' said Sally , that she would never have met him if we had n't gone that night to Maisie 's . ' Yes . Kathleen says it makes her believe in God . ' Kathleen said that ? ' Sally looked up from her tulip . In fun , of course . She 's almost always funny , now , she 's so terribly excited . Except when she 's in the deep depths of despair . She was awfully low when she came back last week from New York . Maybe they had a row . I do n't know . Maybe she was just missing him . '  |p289Of  course she saw a lot of him in New York ? ' Every minute . And she met all his family . ' Did she ? ' said Sally , in surprise . What were they like ? ' Well  --  there were n't very many of them and Kathleen rather liked them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but East-Side kikes . His grandmother  --  Mrs. Sarah Edelstein  --  is just an old woman in a wig . You know how they look on Halsted Street . His father was in the coat and pants business  --  yes , literally  --  and he 's in it still . Wholesale now , of course , down there on Seventh Avenue . And his mother 's ( lead and his elder sister , Judith , is married to a Jewish intellectual and lives in a swell apartment on Central Park West . I Ie 's something brainy and radical  --  you know what I mean  - -  lie writes for the New Republic . That sort of Jew . There 's an uncle who 's a big gun in the Ethical Culture Society  --  but all ( lie rest of them are Orthodox , except the brainy brother-in-law . Ile does n't believe in anything , of course  --  just views with alarm . He wrote an editorial last week  --  Kathleen showed it to me  --  called " The Seamy Side of Prosperity " that would leave given Father apoplexy if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder of the family . He 's the rock on which thedelstein fortunes are built . He was educated in the public schools and he worked his way through Columbia and he 's ripl , lcdwith rhythm from the day he was born . You see '  --  Cora sighed heavily  --  ' on all counts , though Kathleen may fancy them , they 're obviously what Mother would define as Bad News . ' But Cora , ' said Sally , Kathleen is n't thinking of marrying him ? ' I do n't know what she 's thinking . She 's never said the word " marriage " to me . ' Does he say it to her ? ' I do n't know . But what else would he be saying , to the tune of five telegram blanks  --  at Western Union rates ? ' Sally frowned thoughtfully . It 's a mess , is n't it ? I suppose his family would like it . ' On the contrary . Kathleen said it was obvious they rather looked down on her as a goy. '  | Sally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' I think it was . I tell you , she liked them . ' Just the same , Cora , it would be a great mistake . ' Lots of marriages turn out to be that , ' said Cora noncommittally . Sally sat in silence . Presently Cora broke the little pause . Sally , he 's made her over into a different person  --  just as you 've made a different flower of that tulip in your hand . You 've turned it inside out  --  changed it from a cool , slim , lemon-coloured tulip into a red and yellow and russet camellia , all queer and tropical . That 's just what Maurice Edelstein has t done to Kathleen . She 's not cool , any longer , or conventional , or cynical . She 's showing me colours I never knew were there . She 's feeling  --  like the devil  --  and why should n't she indulge her feeling ? ' Well , ' said Sally slowly , I do n't know why she should n't . That is , if  --  if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does that sort of feeling last in any marriage ? ' asked Cora coolly . Sally met her eyes honestly . Well  --  of course it does n't  --  it does n't last so very long . But when it 's gone Sally paused . What ? ' asked Cora . You have to have something else to build on . ' Such as ? ' asked Cora . Oh  --  mutual respect and compatibility and  --  and intellectualsympathy Sally 's voice trailed off rather lamely . Sally , that 's the bunk and you know it , ' said Cora firmly . There 's nothing that makes a real marriage but love . When that 's gone , a marriage is just an arrangement . Convenient or inconvenient . Necessary or unnecessary . I say when they 're inconvenient and unnecessary , they 'd better bust up . ' Oh , Cora , ' said Sally impulsively , you do n't know what you 're talking about . When a man marries you --  ' Well ? ' He  --  he does something to you . You 're never quite thesame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRESENT 291P291What ? ' Well  --  things that you ca n't forget . He ca n't forget them either . ' Some men seem to . Some women , too . ' I think they just pretend , ' said Sally firmly . When you 've done something awfully serious with another person , it 's part of you both . Of course , I do n't say that marriage is n't diffi-cult ' Cora was looking rather closely at her cousin . She did not say anything more . Presently she rose languidly to her feet . Then , Sally , ' she said abruptly , you 're a good egg . Is that a motor ? ' Sally nodded . It 's probably Alan . Home from the four-fifteen . ' Cora was frowning thoughtfully . Sally , ' she said , why do n't you and Alan go off for a little trip this summer ? Leave the boys with your mother . Out West  --  camping  --  a hundred miles from a telephone . ' Sally looked up , arrested by the manner in which Cora had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think Alan would feel he could do it , Cora . He 's terribly busy . ' Cora shrugged her lean shoulders . Just then Alan 's voice was heard on the front steps . Sally ? Are you home ? Where did this case of champagne come from ? ' Tim brought it , ' called Sally . It 's a present . ' Alan came around the corner of the house . Some present ! Hello , Cora ! We 'll have to have a party . Has Tim gone ? ' Yes . He could n't wait . I wish you 'd been here to see him , Alan . ' Could n't make it . Does it ever occur to you that I 'm busy ? ' The familiar note of nervous irritation was creeping into Alan 's tone . Yes . It has , ' said Sally dryly . Alan turned from her impatiently . He strolled across the terrace and back again , in silence . Then ,  | What are we doing tonight ? ' he asked . Nothing , thank God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . Alan paused on the terrace step at her elbow . For a moment he did not answer . Then he leaned over , a little awkwardly , to pat her shoulder . Sally knew the pat was an apology . I 'm tired , too , ' he said . We 'll turn in early . ' Cora was looking at them , steadily , from her stand on the terrace . Alan did not say anything more . Sally leaned back against his knee and listened to the spring silence . It was broken by the sound of birds , twittering intermittently in the oak copse . The voices of the children , walking now on the bluff 's edge with Emma , came thinly across the lawn . Little voices , shrill but ineffective in the distance  --  in the sense of space and tranquillity that pervaded the Sewalls ' grounds . Suddenly a telephone bell rang sharply in the house behind her . Rang . Ceased . And rang again . It was followed by silence . So someone had answered it . Little Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had found something in a hawthornbush . A bird 's nest probably . Sally was still conscious of holding her breath in suspense when the house door opened on the terrace . Clara , the waitress , in a plum-coloured uniform and neat scalloped apron , advanced across the grass . She paused , respectfully , a few feet from Sally . Mr. MacLeod is wanted on the telephone , ' she said. 2Sally lay stretched on the warm grass at the bluff 's edge , the blue jersey straps of her bathing-suit slipped down over her shoulders , exposing the full expanse of her thin , fashionably tanned back to the rays of the August sun . She had just scrambledup the bluff trail after a solitary dip in the lake , and the hot summer breeze , the prevailing southwest one , which was blowing over Lakewood from miles of midland cornfield and prairie , felt so pleasantly refreshing on her bare , lake-cooled body , that she did not want , just yet , to walk on up to the house and put on her clothes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burying her nose in thep293close-clipped turf and sniffing the sweet odour of the newly cut grass . Even now , at the end of summer , it was fresh and green , because of Willy 's hose . The little severed grass blades were drying in the sun . The children , who were playing on the beach , did run naked , or almost , all summer long . That was the nicest thing about being a modern child . They lived in their de Pinna bathing-suits  --  short , navy-blue trunks , with white linen belts  --  and their little thin , ribbed torsos were as brown as those of Indian boys . When they wriggled and the belts slipped , a line of milk-white little-boy skin showed below the tan . ComfortMacLeod wore a suit like that , too  --  with a brief bib added as a sop to feminine modesty . They ran , bare-backed , bareheaded , bare-armed , bare-legged , and sandal-footed , all the long summer days . They slipped into khaki for supper  --  soft , yellow , sun-faded khaki  --  which harmonized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their little bony , brown hands . With a smile for the benighted generation of her parents , Sally thought of the clothes that she herself had worn as a child . Long-waisted , starched linen , Russian blouses , with black patent-leatherbelts  --  white muslin smocked frocks for supper . And Sam in sailor suits  --  blue-and-white striped sailor suits , with starched navy-blue collars and dickies , from de Pinna , too . Ferris waists and underdrawers and petticoats and undershirts . Shoes and stockings and long sleeves and sailor hats , for fear they 'd get a sunstroke . Well  --  the world had learned something in the last three decades , if it was only not to put on too many clothes ! - She could remember Sam  --  in a sailor suit  --  lying with her , once , in this very spot , sniffing the newly cut grass . Sam had shown her how , when the grass blades were close to your eye , you lost all sense of scale and you could pretend that they were the palm fronds of a tropical forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their roots were antediluvian monsters , and that you were a giant , much bigger than the monsters , so you could kill them if you wanted to  --  only you ( lid not want to , because they seemed so busy and so hurried and so frightfully intent upon some private affair which meant a great deal to them . Sam had said speculatively that perhaps that was the way God felt about the people in the world  --  and he could not have been more than eight ! Sally sighed and turned over on her back and covered her eyes with her hands , so the sun would not shine in them , and wondered whether , if Sam had lived , he would have . been able to cope , any better than the rest of them , with the post-War world . Funny  --  she could not imagine Sam , racketing about and drinking too much and not knowing what he wanted ! When you died young , at least you died safe . And the people who loved you remembered you , always , as happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of them were charming any more . Yet it could not be just age  --  for Granny was charming , and her mother , just as they had always been ; and Aunt Cora , when she wanted to be , in her way , which was a pretty foolish one , but which still , at sixty-one , kept its archaic , artificial appeal . Even Aunt Adelaide was charming , when you thought of her as a type  --  plump , placid , and precise , so utterly the elderly rector 's wife ! Perhaps it was a question of period rather than age . But how rotten to belong to a period in which you lost your charm before you were thirty ! You lost your charm , even if you kept your looks . The beautiful and the damned '  --  ' all the sad young men '  --  the lost generation . ' Sally 's lip curled as she thought of F. Scott Fitzgerald 's sentimental cynicism  --  of his easy selfpity . When she read his books , she could not believe at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trivial  --  the necking and the drinking and the general promiscuity of behaviour . But it was not charming . And the loss of ; charm was not a trivial thing . She herself , Sally reflected soberly , had been charming when she married Alan . The wedding pictures , in the white vellumboundvolume , testified to that . Happy and eager and good in the soft draped swirls of her white chiffon wedding dress , and pretty , too , in the flattering folds of her mother 's lace veil . And Alan had been charming  --  young and smiling and confident in his khaki . What had happened to both of them ? And why had it happened ? Looking back down the years it was hard top295understand . Looking back down the months , even of this last summer , Sally could not put her finger on the exact moments when they had slipped . There was , of course , the time that Alan had been really tight at Maisie 's dance . Sally flushed with shame as she thought of that evening . Alan had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry afterwards . He had even given her a star sapphire ring . He had said , shame-facedly , that he had taken a little flyer in Montgomery Ward and the ring was her dividend . Sally had accepted the peace offering with mixed emotion . With tenderness for Alan and regret for her own high words and yet  --  with a certain vague sense of personal degradation . A shrewish wife  --  to be quieted with a sapphire . But Alan had not meant it like that . For several days they had been very happy together . And then Alan grew cross again . And she grew crosser . Perhaps it was because he was so very tired . Both he and his father were working like madmen in their offices in the bank . Uncle George had lost weight and his placid , rubicund countenance wore a new look of strained , unnatural excitement . He , too , kept longer and longer hours . Aunt Cora had a new emerald . Even Sally 's father seldom took occasion now to slip away from the city on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pictures , as he so often used to do . He had bought a great many new pictures , but he nover had time to enjoy them . Sally thought some of them were very queer . Gauguins , Cezannes , Matisses , and Picassos  --  strange , tropical landscapes , inhabited by chunky-looking brown people with flowers in their hair  --  and still-life studies of brilliant bouquets and gaudily coloured fruit , grotesquely drawn , Sally could not help thinking , somewhat in the technique of little Sam 's contemporariesin the Third Grade . Sally knew she must be wrong about this , because her father was always right about Art , ' and moreover she could remember the time when his Monets had seemed to her no more than stippled daubs of colour and his Manets wayward streaks of paint and his Whistler seascapes too odd and obscure to be very interesting . Still , her father himself did not seem to enjoy these new picturesas he had enjoyed his old ones , though he had addedp296another room to his art gallery in which to hang them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colour , but nobody spent much time with them . Sally 's mother preferred her old favourites and Aunt Adelaide thought the chunky-lookingbrown people were obscene  --  some of their poses , Sally had to admit , were pretty queer  --  and Aunt Cora 's appreciation of painting was just where it was in the year 1900 . Cora professed to like them , but possibly , Sally thought , only to provokeher mother - and even Cora had succumbed to humour . Sally had found her one day staring fascinated at a foreshortenedstudy of a fleshy nude standing on one leg in a Parisian garret drying her back with a checked bathtowel , and Cora had said , I think Picasso puts it all over Bouguereau  --  he makes you feel so much better about yourself ! ' Sally laughed aloud , as she thought of how Cora had looked as she had said it  --  lank and lean and boyish because of her shingled hair  --  a mere sexless clothes-rack on which her tweed suit was hung . But Cora was a dear . She was lucky to have Cora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all summer long , had lost its accustomed poise . Kathleen , Sally supposed , must have been having a pretty rough time of it over her affair with Maurice Edelstein . That was rotten luck . And it seemed , last week , to have come to a definite smash . He had come out to Chicago , so Cora had said  --  for Sally had not seen him  --  and Kathleen had gone in town to meet him several times in the August heat . They had argued and they had quarrelled and he had gone back to New York . And Kathleen had come home to Lakewood in a terrible temper and had locked herself in her room and had not come out of it for eighteenhours . When she did , so Cora reported , she looked like the wrath of God . And she had bitten Aunt Cora 's head off and told Cora herself for God 's sake to shut up , and Cora had said to Sally that she hoped this row was final , as Kathleen quite evidently had not the nerve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on much longer like this . Aunt Cora 's voice , insistent but in the distance , broke in on Sally 's thoughts . She was calling from the rose arch . Sally ! Is your mother home ? '  |p297Sally  sat up and slipped her shoulder straps back on her shoulders . Yes ! I think she 's in the library ! ' Aunt Cora waved jauntily in reply . Sally watched her as she passed down the garden path and behind the cedar hedge and out onto the lawn . There was something rather jaunty about her entire figure . She was smiling airily , her head held high and up , and almost skipping , as she walked , in a slightly arthritic , sixty-one-year-old skip . She waved again at Sally as she opened the porch door . Sally stared after her in astonishment . Aunt Cora 's private meditations , these latter years , were apt to be rather melancholic . At their brightest , they were never of the calibre that leads one to skip . Sally got up curiously and brushed some cut grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch . As she opened the screened door , she could hear Aunt Cora 's voice in the library , raised in earnest converse . The thing I like best about it , Evelyn , is that it 's so eminently suitable . ' Sally entered the library door . Her mother and her Aunt Cora were seated side by side on the sofa . Granny was enthroned in her customary armchair . Granny 's face looked a little bewildered , Sally thought , but her mother 's face was eager . Her eyes were shining and her lips were smiling and she had that young look , which Sally always loved . She was holding Aunt Cora 's hand in her own . Aunt Cora still looked jaunty , in fact somewhat triumphant , and she went on speaking as Sally came into the room . His family 's so nice and there 's money enough and he 's been devoted to her for years . They 'll live in Lakewood , so she wo n't be taken away from us , and I 'm sure they 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 's in the seventh heaven . George feels already as if he were our own son Sally 's mother interrupted her . She looked up at Sally with that lovely , happy smile  --  a smile of vicarious romance . Kathleen is engaged to Billy Bangs , ' she said . Sally sat down suddenly in the nearest armchair . To Billy Bangs ? ' she repeated . Yes , dear , ' smiled Aunt Cora , and we 're all so happy aboutp298it . Your Uncle George wants to build them a little house in our garden  --  just like yours and Alan 's . It 's not announced yet  --  in fact it 's just happened  --  but it will be on Saturday . I 'm going to give a little informal tea . I thought Kathleen might like a dinner after it , but she says she does n't To Billy Bangs ? ' said Sally , stupidly , once more . Of course , ' said Aunt Cora . A hint of sharpness had crept into her tone . I  --  I was just surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her armchair and crossed her knees , a little weakly . Her thoughts were tumbling over each other in her effort to understand  --  to catch the finer nuances of the situation so blandly exposed by Aunt Cora . I do n't see why you should be , ' said Aunt Cora firmly . She looked at Sally critically . Sally , I 've become reconciled to the modern bathing-suit on the beach , but I must say that bare legs in a library  --  ' Sally apologetically uncrossed her knees . A sudden memory of family kodak books , containing snapshots of Aunt Cora equipped for aquatic sport in the gay nineties , flashed through her mind  --  Aunt Cora in black alpaca  --  sailor waist , knee skirt , bloomers , and long stockings  --  an Aunt Jemima 's PancakeFlour bandanna tied coquettishly around her pretty head . I 'm sorry , Aunt Cora . I did n't have a bathrobe with me . And you looked so excited - I do n't know why you modern girls want to burn your skins to a crisp , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' But she smiled indulgently . She was in too good a humour to remain critical very long . Suddenly Granny spoke . I 'm surprised , too , ' she said . Everyone looked at her . Granny was infallible , Sally was thinking . She had never even heard Maurice Edelstein 's name . Aunt Cora never talked of him , even with Sally 's mother . It was as if , by ignoring him , she could deprive him of existence . Why , Mother ? ' asked Sally 's mother . Billy 's a dear boy . And he has been in love with Kathleen for years -- Oh , yes , ' said Granny . For a moment she did not say any/thing more . Then , Of course I fell in love with her grandfatherthe night that I met him  --  at that church sociable , in i 86o . But I was eleven years younger than Kathleen . I suppose my emotions were not very complicated . And times were much simpler . Still  --  falling in love is falling in love , at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed me as in love with Billy Bangs . ' Why , Mother , she adores him ! ' said Aunt Cora promptly . Granny did not look entirely convinced . But  --  She must have my seed-pearl earrings , ' she said . On her wedding day . I gave Sally the brooch on hers . I 'm saving the bangle for Cora . ' Oh , Cora ! ' sighed Aunt Cora resignedly . Your father gave me that seed-pearl set the day we were married , ' continued Granny . I thought it was the loveliest thing I had ever seen . ' Sally was suddenly impelled to jump up and kiss her . The gift of the groom ! ' she said . Granny smiled tranquilly . Her cheek felt incredibly soft and silky , in spite of its wrinkles , under Sally 's young lips . Almost like a baby 's cheek , Sally was thinking . When are they going to be married ? ' asked Sally 's mother . Immediately , ' said Aunt Cora . That was Kathleen 's own idea . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 'll have to wait a month , for me to get her trousseau together . In September , I think  --  late September  --  and of course at Saint George 's . I think it 's so sweet to have a clergyman in the family . It makes it all so intimate . And Saint George 's is large enough to hold everyone in Lakewood  --  everyone , at least , whom you 'd want to have come . I like a crowded wedding . It 's so gay . ' Aunt Cora was holding her head high and alertly . Her face had assumed the festive expression it wore at a party . Sally knew she was seeing herself , in a Molyneux fall model , in the front , left-hand pew . Suddenly her aunt looked at her . Kathleen was going over to your house , with Cora , Sally , to tell you about it . ' Was she ? Then I 'll go home  --  and take my legs with ine ! ' She waved her hand to her mother and walked to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Aunt Cora . She felt obscurely sorry for her . It was touching , to the modern mind  --  Aunt Cora 's Victorian conviction that by saying something , you made it true . I 'm awfully glad about it , Aunt Cora , of course . I 've always liked Billy . ' Everyone likes him , ' said Aunt Cora blandly . On that Sally left the room . She walked slowly across the lawn , the cut grass deliciously tickling her bare feet , and tiptoedgingerly down the gravel paths of the garden . From the rose-beds she could see Cora and Kathleen on her terrace . Cora was sprawled on the steps , wearing a wrinkled brown linen skirt and a mannish white sport blouse and a brown Cadogan sweater . Her orange tie made a spot of colour that picked up the shade of the marigolds at the terrace edge . She had on her careful expression . Not even to Kathleen , and certainly not to Sally , was Cora going to give anything away . Kathleen was in white  --  bridal white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk , with her yellow head high and her blue eyes remote and her mouth an enigmatic line of scarlet . Her slim beige ankles were crossed in front of her as she sat in a wicker chair . They were not speaking to each other . But when Cora saw Sally , she gave a cheerful hoot . Hi , Sally ! Come on over ! You look like Miss America in an Atlantic City Board Walk beauty contest . Be prepared for a shock ! ' I know all about it ! ' called Sally . I 've seen Aunt Cora . ' She thought that , at her words , Kathleen looked slightly relieved . She did not spare herself , however , the formal announcement . It was as if she had learned her speech , like a child , and still felt she must say it . I 'm going to marry Billy Bangs , ' she said . I know , darling ! ' cried Sally , as she ran up the steps . I think it 's grand ! ' She hurried over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? ' said Cora , as Kathleen did not speak . Is that your ring ? ' cried Sally , catching up Kathleen 's left hand . It 's a beautiful diamond . ' Is n't it ? ' said Cora again.  |p30IWe  're going to be married the end of September , ' said Kathleen very composedly . I 'd like to be married tomorrow , but Mother ' Is all for Preparedness ! ' put in Cora jovially . I think we should have been filling Kathleen 's hope chest for years . In times of Peace prepare for War . I 'm going to begin on mine tomorrow . There may be something in this theory of your mother 's , Sally , that when nations are armed , war is apt to occur . I 'd love to feel that I was " apt " to be married ! ' Kathleen laughed . Cora  --  you arch-ass ! ' she said . The tension was slackening , Sally thought gratefully . Cora was wonderful . She was trying to be wonderful , herself . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer long , on that very terrace , about Billy and Kathleen and Maurice Edelstein , were stalking between them , like ghosts that would not be laid . I 'll ring for some cocktails , ' she said . Then over her shoulder , as she walked toward the house door , We ought to celebrate . ' She rang the house bell . Gin sours , Clara ! ' she called . And caviar sandwiches and olives ! ' She walked back to the terrace edge and sat down on the steps by Cora 's side . She stretched out her bare legs luxuriously in the sunshine . I want you for my matron of honour , Sally , ' said Kathleen calmly . And Cora for maid of honour  --  and Mother thinks I ought to scare up six bridesmaids . All my friends were married long ago . Most of them are divorced ! Mother does n't mind a matron in a bridal procession , but she draws the line at a divorcee . She says Uncle Lambert would throw a fit . And the great argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sewall in . Mother says she 'll have the grace to stay away . But I know Gertrude . She 'll probably walk up the aisle on Baines 's arm and if we have n't chained her to the proper pew she 'll sit right down beside Aunt Adelaide in the third one ! ' I think she ought to wear half mourning and sit in the side aisle , ' said Sally cheerfully . What would you say , ' asked Kathleen brightly , about having the kids in the procession ? Do you think little Alan would behave ? You know  --  Comfort in pale pink , with a basket of flowers , and Sam and Alan following after her in new white suits  --  They 'd be darling . ' I 'll make Alan behave ! ' said Sally fiercely . I 'd be in the chancel with him . ' The idea of a family wedding was taking fire in her mind . After all  --  weddings were fun , and if this wedding was going to provide a stage on which she could show off her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at heart ! I think , ' said Kathleen daringly , I 'll wear a long skirt . ' Kathleen  --  you could n't ! ' Sally 's protest was quick . Legs are awful with veils , ' her cousin insisted . Even mylegs . ' She stretched them out admiringly . Which are prettydarn good . Maybe I could wear Mother 's wedding dress andcall it sentiment . When was Mother married , Cora ? ' Eighteen-ninety-five . It took her four years to pull herself togetherand have me . I sometimes think she wishes she never had ! ' Kathleen ignored the mock-melancholy of her tone . Eighteen-ninety-five , ' she said meditatively . Stiff satin . Big sleeves . High necks . Gored skirts . It might look rather nice , Sally . ' As she spoke , the house door opened and Clara emerged on the terrace , with the cocktail shaker and three ruby-red glasses and a plate of sandwiches on a little tray . Gosh , that looks good ! ' said Cora . These last two days have been a crowded hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kathleen took hers . Sally picked up the last one . Just put the tray on the chair , Clara , ' she said . Thank you . ' Then , when the house door had closed behind the maid , Well  --  here 's to the bonny bride ! ' And William ! ' added Cora . And William ! ' echoed Sally . In the excitement over the wedding , she had almost forgotten Billy Bangs . Poor Billy ! Yet , why poor Billy ? He was getting what he had been after for years . Still  --  it was a short deal . It must be . Why was Kathleen doing it ? Poor Kathleen ! Oh , yes  --  at any rate  --  poor , poor Kathleen ! Here 's luck to both of them ! ' said Sally devoutly and drained her glass . Kathleen raised hers.  |p303Here  's luck to Billy ! ' she said . Her voice shook a little . Fill up your glasses again , girls . ' As they did so , she went on , audibly endeavoring to conquer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I know that Billy 's too good for me . He  --  he 's simply marvellous . About me , I mean . Well  --  here 's luck to him ! ' Sally 's eyes were misted as she raised her glass . He 's a darling , Kathleen , ' she said , after a moment . Her own voice was shaking . And I want to tell you something  --  there 's nothing like a husband who  --  who 's good . Just plain good . So few of us are , any longer . ' Do n't I know it ? ' cried Kathleen . Then , rather vaguely , Oh  --  I  --  I 'm in luck . ' She turned her head away and selected , with perhaps unnecessary care , a caviar sandwich . Cora was looking at her with anxious eyes . Tension , Sally thought desperately , was creeping back into the situation . She was awfully glad , a moment later , to hear the toot of Alan 's motor horn , on the drive . We could n't lose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sally 's father and mother and Uncle Fred and Granny and Alan and Sally herself had been dining with Mr. MacLeod and Rose in the house on the Skokie Ridge . They were sitting out on the west porch now , with their after-dinner coffee , enjoying the night breeze  --  still the prevailing southwestone  --  which was sweeping over the damp meadows which lined the river-banks . In early September the Skokie River was little more than a muddy ditch , but it seeped surreptitiouslythrough the marshlands which surrounded it , and the winds that blew over it after nightfall were touched by a faint miasmic chill , not unpleasant on a night as oppressive as that of the third of September , 1929 . Rose was a good housekeeper and Mr. MacLeod 's dinner had been delicious and Sally felt pleasantly quiescent as she leaned back in her bamboo chair . As was customary , of late , when the Sewalls , Truesdales , and MacLeods met in family conclave , the conversation had taken a business turn . Thep304women sat in silence  --  Sally 's mother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armchair , and Rose , with her arm around Comfort , on a swinging bench  --  thinking their own thoughts , while the men reviewed the events of the banking day . Now , see here , Mac  --  ' Uncle George was continuing . The early September darkness had closed in on the Skokie valley and the sky in the zenith was overcast and the little crescent moon , swung low in the west , did not give much light . But Sally could see Uncle George 's face distinctly in the glow from the living-room lamp which shone out through the glass doors of the porch . It looked eager , almost boyish , in spite of his grey hair and the pouches under his eyes and the sag in his plump cheeks . His mouth was twitching a little with excitement , under its close-clipped grey moustache . We could n't lose , ' Mr. MacLeod interrupted him , but how much would we win ? ' Well , ' said Uncle George , we can buy that block for fourteenmillion dollars and it 's right in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of wrecking what 's on it  --  it 's negligible . There 's not a building there less than ten years old . We could put up a twenty-story skyscraper , with four ten-story towers , for  --  oh , say , twenty-five million . And you could raise a bond issue for thirty million at five and a half per cent . That leaves our net investment under ten million dollars . I 've got an estimate of rentals , here in my pocket , and , on a conservative basis , they 'd bring us over sixteen per cent on our equity . We 'll lease every inch of office space before the building 's finished and It sounds , ' said Sally 's father , interrupting in his turn , and very judicially , pretty good to me . ' The tip of Mr. MacLeod 's cigar glowed and faded two or three times in his corner , before he spoke again . Then , We 're rather heavily committed to the utilities , ' he said slowly . I saw Insull last week and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said Alan cheerfully . Every loan we 've made them is on good collateral . Think what Commonwealth Edison is selling for today ! '  |p305Three  hundred and eighty-one and a half ; ' said Sally 's father promptly . I bought six hundred shares . ' You 'll never regret it , ' said Uncle George . And you 'll never regret this deal I 'm putting up to you now . You ca n't lose on Loop real estate . It has scarcity value . And our subdivisionsare booming . The bank 's never been in such good shape . ' Granny stirred in her armchair . I do n't like to hear you say that , George , ' she put in , a trifle sharply . There was nothing wrong with the bank in Horace 's father 's day . ' No , Mother . Of course not . ' Uncle George 's voice was contrite . And Sally 's father added , We 're only progressing  --  going farther along the road that he laid out . ' It does n't look like the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father found enough to keep him busy within the four walls of the bank . He did n't try to finance the universe . ' The family all laughed at that , if rather indulgently , but Granny continued . The note of severity was still in her tone . Even if you do raise that bond issue  --  and I suppose you will  --  where are you going to get that other ten million ? I know you 've been doing well , but I do n't believe you 've got ten million dollars in your checking accounts . ' We 'll form a little syndicate , Mother , ' explained Sally 's father kindly . Give some of our friends a chance to get in on the ground floor . Mac could raise ten million dollars at one luncheon at the Chicago Club  --  if it were the right luncheon . The bank could underwrite the bond issue . Those bonds would go like wildfire . ' Well  --  I do n't quite understand it , ' said Granny . Then added briskly , But that 's only because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never heard talked about by bankers before . I 've heard plenty of talk in my time  --  but banking certainly is n't what it was when your father went into it . No one would have dreamed of raising ten million dollars at a luncheon , then . Or one million . Or of asking a bank to underwrite a construction loan ?  | It would be secured by the first mortgage , ' said Mr. MacLeod . And  --  ' Oh , Mother , ' said Sally 's father , think of what went on here after the Fire . Plenty of construction then  --  and mighty little security . ' That was different , ' said Granny stoutly . Your father thought those loans were a civic duty . The city had to get on its feet . ' Well  --  this loan is a civic duty , too , ' said Uncle George piously . Chicago will soon be treading on the heels of New York . It 's an age of competition , Mother . ' Yes . But I ca n't help thinking there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Even Mac and Horace are mixed up with a lot of promoters  --  and profiteers , too  --  that I would n't trust around the corner . Conservative banking brings in plenty of money . Why do you all want to spread out ? ' Sally heard Uncle Fred chuckle in the darkness . She herself had almost laughed aloud as she heard on Granny 's lips almost the very words with which Bee had once denounced the bootlegging trade . Sally 's father was laughing heartily . Mother , you should have heard the speech last week at the Commercial Club banquet . Alden Carver , of Boston , the new president of the Bay State Trust Company , came West to make it . He 's Stephen Carver 's brother  --  Carver , of the Midland Loan and Trust Company , next door to us on La Salle Street . Stephen 's not very progressive  --  one of those slow-going chaps  --  and I do n't believe he held with all his brother said . ' What did he say ? ' inquired Granny mildly . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move mountains . He took a text like a preacher , " Show me thy faith by thy works , " and urged the bankers not to sell America short . ' I met Alden Carver once , ' said Granny . Her tone held reserves . He was a pudgy-faced young boy . ' He 's a pudgy-faced old boy , now ! ' put in Uncle George jovially . Where did you meet him , Mother ? ' asked Sally 's father.  |p307'Oh   --  we used to know his father in the old days . The Bay State Trust Company was a great bank . We spent three days , once , at his place , Gull Rocks , in the late eighties . Out on the Cape , it was . Old Mr. Carver was a God-fearing , money getting New Englander , and he ran his bank without benefit of texts . " Do n't overplay your hand " was his motto . Your father used to say that Steve Carver got to know the Indian on a penny pretty well , before he spent it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I expect the night of the Commercial Club banquet he turned in his grave . ' ' Oh , I do n't know , ' said Mr. MacLeod . ' His bank stock 's quoted at nine hundred . Beats ours by fifty points . ' ' I 'm giving Kathleen a little block of the Farmers ' Loan and Trust Company stock for a wedding present , Mother , ' said Uncle George , ' as a matter of sentiment . ' At the mention of Kathleen 's name a slight , sympathetic rustle ran over the feminine members of the party . It was as if the soft chiffon of their evening gowns had been stirred by the wings of romance . Sally 's mother said , ' How is the dear child , Cora ? I have n't seen her for three days . ' ' Oh  --  she 's busy , ' said Aunt Cora . ' We 're all terribly busy . And of course she 's getting tired out . We picked out her household linen today . It 's high now , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope to get the work done soon , so she can rest for a week before the wedding . I want her to look her best . She tried on my wedding dress yesterday . ' ' Oh , did she ? ' cried Sally 's mother softly . ' How did it look ? ' ' Charming , ' said Aunt Cora . ' We 'll have to let out the waist and take in the hips a trifle . Modern figures are so different . I think '  --  Aunt Cora paused and then continued modestly  --  ' I think she can pin a little lace ruffle inside , around  --  around the top of her chemise . I 'd hate to change the cut of that bertha  --  it 's all real rose point . She looked so pretty in it . ' ' I 'm sure she did n't look any prettier than you did , ' said Granny suddenly . And Granny seldom paid compliments . ' You remember , Evelyn ? Cora was a lovely bride . ' ' I remember , ' Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p308Sally  was touched . It was funny to think of Uncle George and Aunt Cora having actually had a wedding day ! Thirtyfouryears ago . Poor Uncle George ! Fancy being Aunt Cora 's husband for thirty-four years ! We all remember , ' said Sally 's mother sweetly . I think it 's so dear of Kathleen to want to wear the gown . ' Oh , she 's full of sentiment ! ' cried Aunt Cora promptly . She 's so full of sentiment that I can hardly keep her mind on the details . " Oh , Mother , " she keeps saying , " I do n't care ! " Billy was quite disturbed when she said she did n't care where they went for their honeymoon . But I told him ' Comfort 's asleep , ' said Rose softly and suddenly . Do you think I could carry her upstairs ? ' I will , ' said Uncle Fred . He rose as he spoke , and tiptoed across the porch and bent over the swinging bench and picked up Comfort from Rose 's lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulder . Her small bare legs dangled limply over his arm . Rose laughed . She 's simply sunk , ' she said , and rose from the bench . I 'll go with you , Fred . ' Then , as the child murmured something , You 're all right , Comfort . Uncle Fred has you . ' Togetherthey went into the living-room . Then , Steel touched two hundred and sixty-one and three quarters today , ' said Alan , bringing the conversation back to the allengrossingsubject of finance . I had an order in to buy at two hundred and fifty-seven and lost it . ' When you 've got a good stock , never hesitate to buy at the market , ' said Uncle George solemnly . Buy it and hold it . With all this construction and the motor industry booming as it is , the possibilities of Steel are unlimited . I should n't wonder if it touched four hundred by January first . ' Sally leaned back once more in her bamboo chair and looked for the crescent moon . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from nowhere on the western horizon . She did not care at all what Steel touched when . What were men made of , she wondered , that they could worry about stocks and bonds all day  --  and then again , all evening . Uncle Fred was the only man she knew whop309did n't . Mr. MacLeod ran all his investments for him and Uncle Fred did not even bother to try to understand them . Mr. MacLeod always laughed at him and said he was like a pretty widow . Uncle Fred laughed , too . He only bothered about people . It was too bad that Uncle Fred had never married . His indifference to stocks and bonds , Sally thought with a sigh , would make him a nice , companionable husband . But he was fifty-three years old . That was getting on . He probably would n't , now . Her father 's voice broke in on Sally 's meditations . Carver said that Westinghouse at two hundred and eightynineand seven eighths was too high . But I said , " Last year we thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd all bought it then , and held on ? " That 's the answer , is n't it ? ' Again Sally ceased to listen . Suddenly she was conscious that the prevailing southwest breeze had dropped . The air was hot and lifeless , but the leaves of the poplar tree in Mr. MacLeod 's garden were whispering in the darkness . Somewhereto the north , she heard the faintest roll of thunder . Alan , ' she said , that was thunder . A storm 's coming up against the wind . The top 's down on the roadster . You 'd better run out and put it up . ' Alan rose and walked to the porch door and opened it and looked up at the sky . It 's pretty black , ' he said . It came up quickly , did n't it ? ' Sally 's father paused , in the act of lighting a new cigar , to listen for a moment . The match-flame illuminated his kindly , grey-bearded face . Another match-flame  --  a vivid line of lightning  --  flashed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving the dark world darker than before . That was up in Wisconsin , ' said Mr. MacLeod . The thunder rolled again . A dim , distant cannonade . It wo n't rain here , ' said Sally 's father . Sally was sitting before her bedroom telephone , the daily marketing list in her hand , trying to decide whether to order broilers or duck for the little dinner that she and Alan were giving that evening for Kathleen and Billy . She was , she thought irritably , thoroughly tired of planning three meals a day . Duck , she decided , with wild rice and green peas and -- -Downstairs in the hall she heard the telephone ring . I 'll answer it , Clara ! ' she called , and put the receiver to her ear . Hello ? Oh  --  hello , Cora ! ' Her cousin 's voice , coming over the wire , sounded a little queer . Sally , are you up ? What are you doing ? ' Of course I 'm up . I 'm always up by ten . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come over here ? Right away ? ' To your house ? ' Yes . I need you . ' What 's up ? ' I 'll tell you when you get here . Come quickly , Sally . ' But Cora --  ' Cora had hung up the receiver . Sally 's curiosity was aroused . Of course , Cora had a million things on her mind , with the wedding only ten days away . A sudden influx of wedding presents , perhaps , with no one on hand to list them . A crisis over the acceptances  --  Aunt Cora had asked twice as many people as the church would comfortably hold . Kathleen in one of her moods again and Aunt Cora hectoring her and Cora in need of somebody to sit on her mother 's head . Aunt Cora , though constantly hectoring , was still keeping up her pretence that there was nothing peculiar about this wedding . The presence of even a negligible niece would change her attitude from the domestic one of nervous irritability to the public one of serene satisfaction . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cora prided herself on remaining stolidly , in every emotional crisis , what she called the family shock-absorber . ' Still curious , Sally completed her ordering and ran down the stairs and out the terrace door and through the garden path and under the rose arch and up the slope of Aunt Cora 's lawn . Cora was waiting for her under the white-painted columns of the portico . She scowled , unamiably , as Sally came up the steps.  |p311You  took forever , ' she said . Well , for Heaven 's sake ! ' said Sally rather crossly . Was it a firerIt was a holocaust , ' replied her cousin gloomily . What 's the matter ? ' asked Sally . She preceded Cora through the front door . Cora pinched her arm . Shut up , now . Come up to my room and I 'll tell you about it . I do n't want Mother to hear us . She 's still in bed , thank God ! ' Something really fervent in her cousin 's tone made Sally look at her questioningly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stately staircase . Aunt Cora 's door was closed . Cora looked worried , Sally observed , yet excited , too , as if something calamitous but subtly exhilarating had happened . When her bedroom door had shut upon them , Cora turned to her at once . ' Sally  --  Kathleen 's cleared out . ' Her voice was low and trembling . Cleared outTShut up ! Keep your voice down ! She 's gone . She 's run away . ' Run awBe quiet , I tell you ! Do you want Mother in on us ? Now listen to me . ' Sally sat down weakly on the nearest chair . Where has she gone ? ' she asked . If you 'll just keep still a moment , I 'll tell you . ' Cora 's voice was no more than a fierce whisper . I have n't seen her since last night . Billy was here and I went upstairs about half-past nine . Georgic was out and Mother and Father were in the living-room . Kathleen was with Billy on the porch . I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I heard Billy go about half-past ten  --  Kathleen never let him stay late , you know . And I heard Father come upstairs and later Mother and Kathleen . They stood arguing in the hall  --  I could n't liear what they said . Nothing important , I thought . And then they separated and Mother went into her room andp312i ' Kathleen went into hers and , after a little while , I went to bed . I did n't know another thing until this morning . ' Cora pausedI to draw a sibilant breath . Well  --  what about this morning ? ' whispered Sally . This morning , ' said Cora , with hushed emphasis , was just like all other mornings . At first . I woke up about a quarter to eight and heard Father and Georgie go off in the car for the train and rang for my breakfast tray . And it came and I drank my coffee and mooned around my room , getting dressed , and a little after nine the maid came in and said Miss Pearl , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Kathleen had n't rung for her breakfast tray and what should she do  --  wake her up ? I said of course  --  Kathleen quite often has an early manicure in bed  --  and the maid hopped off and in a minute she was back with her eyes as big as saucers , just burbling with excitement , saying that Kathleen was n't there and her bed had n't been slept in and there were three letters on her dressing-table , addressed to Father , and to Billy , and to me . ' Cora ! ' breathed Sally . Well , you can better believe I hopped myself , when I heard that ! I ran into her room in my underclothes , with the maid after me . She was n't going to miss a trick . And there was the bed  --  all neatly turned down , with Kathleen 's nightgownon the pillow and her wrapper on the bedpost and her slippers on the rug . And there were the three letters  --  sealed  --  propped up on her pincushion , like a scene in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maid , " You make this bed and you hang up that nightgown and you keep quiet about this until I tell you you can talk ! " And then I took the three letters and came back to my own room . There they are  --  on the desk . ' There they were , indeed , three square , grey envelopes , one torn raggedly open . Cora walked over to the desk and picked up the open one and returned to Sally . This is what she wrote , ' she began . Then paused in the act of drawing out the letter to look steadily at Sally . Sally , ' she said , I know this is frightful , but I want to say , right herep313and now , that I 'm all on Kathleen 's side . You do n't know what that girl was going through 5'Read me the letter , ' said Sally . She was trembling with excitement . It 's quite long , ' said Cora . She sat down on the edge of her bed . Her voice was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it steadied presently . Cora darling , If you think I 'm crazy that makes it unanimous . I know I 'm crazy . I 've been crazy for almost a year . I understand perfectly what a hideous thing I 'm doing  --  do n't think that I do n't . But I ca n't marry Billy Bangs . And I ca n't face the uproar . I tried to tell Billy last night and I could n't . He would n't understand . He just kept on saying that I was tired and not myself and -- Oh , God ! I could n't look into those honest spectacles and tell him ! And then Mother nabbed me on the way upstairs and began raggingme on the way I treated him . She 'd seen him in the hall , and I guess he did look pretty down . And when I got into my room , with the door locked , it just came over me that I could n't stand it . And why should I , Cora , why , in God 's name , should I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need n't  --  well , I knew just what I wanted to do . I wanted to get out  --  before the storm broke . Though I knew it was outrageous . I knew I ought to face the music . But , Cora  --  you know Mother . And you know how  --  how pathetic Billy is ! I could n't do it , Cora . In the state I 'm in , I just did n't have the nerve . And then I began to wonder where I could go . But while I was wondering , I knew . I knew all the time , I guess , even before I was sure I was going . There was just one person in the world I wanted to be with , and I 'd wanted to be with him from the moment I met him . He was , of course , the real right reason why I could n't marry Billy Bangs . I do n't know how to explain it to you  --  but it all seemed suddenlysimple . When you 're pushed to desperation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had decided to murder somebody sleeping and I had a knife in my hand and I only had to cut his throat . A minute would do it . Deciding to murder  --  or to marry  --  that 's what 's hard . I only had to go to Maurice and tell him how I felt . I only had to get out of this house . I knew that when I did , all this  --  this ruction would seem unimportant . Comparativelyunimportant . In the meantime , I just had to live through it . So I sat down and wrote a letter to Father and another to Billy . And you need n't think those letters were easy to write . I could n't manage Mother  --  just thinking of her reading them , killed the words on my pen . And now I 'm writing to you . I have quite a lot of money  --  my check-book , of course , and nearly one hundred dollars  --  and when I 've finished this I 'm going to pack a bag and go downstairs and let myself out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garage and take my car and drive to town and I 'm going to fly to New York tonight , if I have to charter a plane . I 'm going to wire Maurice to meet me at the airportand ask the first rabbi he can dig up to marry us . If a rabbi wo n't do it on the spur of the moment , a J.P . will . Cora , darling , do n't think I do n't realize what I 'm dumping on your shoulders . I suppose Mother will go out of her mind . All those wedding presents and the invitations out and  --  I just wo n't think about it ! I ca n't . I feel as if I were being carried to the operating-table for an emergency operation . Someone else must do the thinking . But Cora  --  it 's awfully hard on you . You 'll be an angel , because you 've always been one . And next to Maurice  --  Cora 's voice fell and faltered again  --  I love you better than anyone in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has his solitaire in it . And when you can bear it , see him and try to make him understand . Tell him that even what I 'm doing tonight is less rotten than marrying him . I hope he never has to see my face again . I 'll write you as soon as I 'm married and you can reach me , always , i in care of Mrs. Felix Strauss , West Sixty-Fourth Street and Central Park West . Give my love to Georgie and tell him that if he everf gets to know Maurice , he 'll like him . Cora  --  you 've been a swell big sister . That says it all , does n't it ? Cora 's voice was shaking now in earnest . Ever your little one , KATHLEENAs she read the name , Cora looked up at Sally . The tears were running down Sally 's cheeks . Oh , Cora , ' she said brokenly , I never realized . I thought I did  --  but I did n't . We might  --  we might have helped her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could n't . I could n't , even . She would n't let me . From the moment she told Billy she 'd marry him , she 'd never let me speak . She was in hell . That 's all . You see  --  she was so fond of Billy . And Mother --  ' Corastopped and wiped her eyes quite frankly . She smiled , weakly , at Sally , and blew her nose . I know , ' said Sally . For a moment they sat in silence . Then , Well , ' said Cora more cheerfully , I read this letter and I  --  I just could n't believe it . I thought I 'd go out to the garage and see if she 'd taken her car . It seemed impossible  --  her going off like that in the middle of the night . I walked downstairs and fell over Miss Pearl , of course , sitting with her manicure kit in the front hall . I told her Kathleen was asleep and sent her off , and then I went out the side door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dark , and down the back path , and there was Edwards , in his shirt-sleeves , in front of the garage , polishing the Packard . I looked over his shoulder and there was Georgie 's Buick and my Chrysler  --  but Kathleen'swas gone . I thought Edwards was looking at me rather queerly , so I said , " Miss Kathleen took her car out , did n't she ? "  --  as if nothing had happened . And he said , " Yes , miss , she did . She took it out about half-past twelve last night . " I wondered how he knew that , and after a moment he told me . " I heard Miss Kathleen starting it . I was up in my bedroom . So I came down to see if everything was all right . " I was trying to make up my mind what to say to that , but before I 'd decided , he went on . " I was surprised to see , Miss Cora , that the car had n't come back this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She said she was going to a party . " He hesitated then , and looked at me  --  IAwards is a good egg , you know  --  and added , " She bad a suitcase with her . " I did n't say anything and he said apologetically , " I thought maybe there was liquor in it . " At that , I nearly laughed . It 's a great age , Sally . A distracted maiden  --  lopes with a suitcase at midnight and the family chauffeur thinks tactfully that maybe there 's liquor in it ! I told him Kathleen was all right . He looked relieved . He said , " I 'm glad to hear it , miss . I 'd begun to think that perhaps there had been an accident . But Mr. Truesdale did n't say anything on the way to the train , so " " Did you say anything ? " I asked him . " About Miss Kathleen ? No , I did n't , " he said . He looked a little embarrassed . I could see it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well trained not to gossip with Father . When Georgie gets home is nobody 's business . " That was right , " I said . And he looked relieved again . And then I came back to the house and called you up . ' Sally drew a long breath . Well , ' she said , that 's that . Now , what are you going to do ? ' Cora glanced at her wrist watch . Eleven o'clock , ' she said . Twelve o'clock in New York . Maybe she 's married now . Maybe she 's getting married . It 's the grace of God that Mother slept late this morning . ' But , Cora ' Well ? ' She 'll have to know . ' Sure , I 'll have to tell her . She 'll open this letter to Father . ' But , Cora ' said Sally again , and again words failed her . Well ? ' How will you tell her ? ' I  --  do n't  --  know , ' said Cora . I 'm terribly sorry for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for herself . ' But , Cora  --  it is hard . ' Yes . But not on Mother . Not really . My heart is just breaking for Billy Bangs . But Mother  --  well , you know , Sally , the things she 'll carry on about will all be unimportant . But I suppose they 'll be important to her . She 'll think of the scandal  --  and she 'll call it disgrace  --  and she hates Maurice Edelstein . She 's hardly spoken two words to him . Kathleen had him out here just once . She never tried that again . Mother has n't the least idea of what he 's like . And Father ' Cora paused . Her face was very troubled . Yes ? ' said Sally.  |p317I  'm awfully glad that Kathleen wrote to Father . Mother wo n't bother much about him . But he 'll feel it terribly . He loves Kathleen and he 'll think it was n't honourable . He 'll be terribly cut up about Bill . And , of course , you know , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern . And he has a perfectphobia on Jews . ' Sally nodded solemnly . After a moment , Cora , ' she said , did you notice , in that letter , there was n't one word of doubt about Maurice 's wanting her ? ' In her turn ; Cora nodded . After all , they 'd had a row and he must have known about her engagement ' Yes , ' said Cora . But he wanted her , all right . That was the funny thing about it . They understood each other from the very start . She would n't have to explain anything . ' Sally 's sherry-coloured eyes were dark with vicarious excitement . Cora  --  it 's awfully romantic . ' Sure it 's romantic . But romance is hell . ' Sally shook her head . No , Cora . There 's nothing like it . It will take Kathleen far . " Well , ' said Cora dispassionately , it 's taken me considerably farther than I want to go . You 'd better go home now . I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want me ? ' You bet I do n't . You 've bucked me up a lot . But I do n't want you now , any more than I 'd want you if I were going to set off a stick of dynamite . You 'd better run to cover . ' Sally rose to her feet . She looked at her cousin doubtfully . Cora  --  you 'll need help . ' Oh , no , I wo n't . Not any more help than I 'd need with the dynamite . More things are going to happen in this house within five minutes , without anyone 's helping them , than Cora , you nut ! V'I may be . But I know Mother . You 'd better tell your mother and Aunt Adelaide and Rose . That 's a morning 's work cut out for you . ' Fancy Aunt Adelaide ! ' said Sally . She 'll like it . Someone , at last , has done something more disgraceful than Baines . I tell you who will like it , Sally . Really . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for romance . ' I 'll tell you someone else . ' Who ? ' Granny . ' Granny ? ' Cora 's voice was puzzled . Oh , Sally  --  I 'm worried about Granny . ' You need n't be . ' But the shock ? ' Granny 's hard to shock . She 's all for romance , too . ' But she 's all for conduct . And Kathleen has behaved pretty badly . Not that I blame her . ' Granny wo n't blame her either  --  at heart . She 'll shake her head over it , of course , but she 'll understand . ' I hope so , ' said Cora , but at eighty-five --  Again shelooked at her wrist watch . Now scram , Sally ! ' She walked back to the desk and picked up the letters . I will . I 'll go out in the garden and cover my ears and wait for the explosion . ' Cora opened her door . She dropped her voice .. Look out for falling timbers and splinters of glass and --  ' She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's door . It was still closed . She walked over to it . Sally started down the stairs . She was arrested by Cora 's voice again , raised in a hollow whisper . Sally . ' Yes ? ' The prayers of the congregation are desired . ' Sally giggled . She looked up at her cousin . Cora was standing at her mother 's door , her hand raised , tentatively , to knock upon the panels . Her derisive grin was fading from her face . That face changed slowly , as Sally gazed at it . Maturityfell from it , with the derision . Sally suddenly realized that it looked just as it used to look when Cora was a child . When Cora was a child and had torn her best liberty smocked frock or stubbed out her new shoes or It looked scared.  |p319It  looked as if Cora had forgotten that Sally existed . She frowned , unconsciously , and straightened her thin shoulders and wet her lips , nervously , with the tip of her tongue . Then Sally heard the rap of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cora promptly and a little querulously . Cora 's hand dropped limply to the doorknob . She turned it . Her face was blank now and a little white  --  still childlike . Cora opened the door . Oh , Cora , ' said Aunt Cora , I wish you 'd run into the guest room and get me the list of wedding presents --  ' Her voice died down . Then rose , in an instant , shrilly . Cora ! What 's happened ? ' As Cora slipped into the room , Sally ran incontinently down the stairs . She heard Aunt Cora 's door close . She did not stop . She ran up the hall and out of the front door and down the steps under the white portico and out onto the lawn . Halfwayto the rose arch , she paused and looked back , fearfully , at Aunt Cora 's bedroom windows . The ruffled white muslin curtains , with a hint of pink chintz behind them , hung neatly , as always behind the rectangular panes . One window was half open . Even there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck poignantly with the dramatic indifference of all material objects to the storms of human emotion . A gale of feeling was raging in that room . A whirlwind . A tornado . And muslin valances hung motionless . Sally walked slowly into the rose garden and down the gravel path . She felt tired  --  exhausted  --  yet subtly exhilarated , as Cora had been , by calamity . But was it calamity ? She thought of Kathleen , flying through the night , over a sleeping world , under the summer stars , to a lover 's arms . She thought of Maurice Edelstein . She thought of Billy . She thought , oddly enough , of William Shakespeare . Let me not to the marriage of true mindsAdmit impediments . ' Minds , ' thought Sally . Minds ' seemed to her rather an understatement when she thought of the emotional voltage behind Kathleen 's night flight . But Billy was no more than an impediment . He was pathetic , but he should not be admitted . Of course , he had been admitted and then  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it was inevitable . It was right . Why did it seem so , when Kathleen had betrayed him ? Suddenly Sally knew why . Because Billy could never have possessed what he seemed to have lost . That was the answer . By the time that Sally had passed the cedar hedge and had turned to walk over the lawn to her father 's house , she knew where she stood . She had lined up with Uncle Fred and Granny . She was all for romance . She was all for romance and she would say so frankly . She would say so  --  even to Aunt Cora.  |p321ALAN  , ' said Sally earnestly , you have to get out of this . You have to have a rest . ' Ca n't take it , ' said Alan . His voice was abstracted . He did not even lower the financial page of the Daily News . Sally looked steadily at him from across the hearth-rug . It was one of their rare evenings alone at home . She had slipped into a pale yellow tea gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living-room  --  a light blue sweater that she was making for Comfort for Christmas  --  and was luxuriating , now , in an unwonted sensation of domestic leisure . At least she would have been luxuriating in it if she had not been troubled by Alan 's appearance . He had come home tired , on the seven-thirty-five train in the October darkness  --  so late for dinner that Sally had sent both little boys to bed  --  and he had kept the meal waiting for another fifteen minutes while he mixed himself a cocktail  --  which was unusual for Alan . Except at a party at his own or some other house , Alan seldom took a drink . But even on that basis , Sally thought with a sigh , he was sustainedby alcohol six nights out of seven . This evening he had brightened up a bit , after three Martinis , and had seemed to enjoy his dinner . He had listened , a little vaguely , to Sally 's eager report of the last news of Aunt Cora. liven now , five weeks after Kathleen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centered in the Truesdale household . Today Cora had completed the last of the packingtipof Kathleen 's possessions , which were to be sent after her , grimly , with no word from Aunt Cora , though Cora and Georgie and Sally and Sally 's mother had written her loving letters , and Uncle ncle George had written her one very constrained one , and Uncle Fred had wired her , and Granny had outraged Aunt Cora by dispatching the seed-pearl earrings  --  though too late ti ) r the wedding ceremony  --  on the theory that Kathleen , in spite of her misconduct , was , after all , a family bride.  | Alan had listened to all this gossip with the merest perfunctorycomment , and , as soon as dinner was over he had lit a cigarette and strolled into the living-room and sat down rather wearily and picked up the financial page of the Chicago Daily News . Sally had been knitting some twenty minutes in silence . Now , Alan , ' she said again , you know this is just nonsense . ' For several minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsense ? ' he asked abstractedly . The way you 're living , ' said Sally promptly . The way we 're both living . ' Alan lowered momentarily the margin of the News . What do you mean ? ' he asked . I mean the way you 're working . All summer it 's been dreadful . And now , this last week  --  why , every night you came out on a late train . ' Alan rustled the paper in nervous irritation . Tonight , ' he said , I should n't have come out at all . Dad 's still in there . ' In there ? ' Yes . He had dinner at his desk . Sent the office boy out to bring him a pot of tea and a chicken sandwich from Childs . He had some New York calls in ' But that 's nonsense , too , ' said Sally stoutly . At his age Alan interrupted her . Have you any idea what Dad has on his mind ? ' What ? ' asked Sally . Alan looked at her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you know what the market 's been doing this last month ? ' Of course I listen . I know it 's lower . Goodness me , I hear enough about it ! ' In spite of her rising sense of irritation , Sally felt slightly conscience-stricken . She did n't listen , much , when Alan talked about the market . And this last month her mind had been full of Kathleen 's cataclysm . A family elopement was certainly more interesting than the price of Commonwealth Edison Her thoughts were arrested by the worry in Alan'sp323weary eyes . She dropped her knitting in her lap and said to him gently over her amber knitting-needles , What did it do today , Alan ? ' Plunged , ' said Alan . Plunged from the moment it opened . The ticker tape was hours behind the floor . Lost all the gains it made on Friday and Saturday . And then some . Steel dropped seventeen and a half points . American Tel and Tel dropped thirty-four . General Electric forty-seven and a half . Radio eighteen and three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said Sally , I should think you 'd get used to it . I mean  --  you know it 's always going up or down . ' Alan 's tense hands were crumpling the financial sheet . Sally , ' he said , I sometimes think that women are morons . All of them . Have you no idea what this may mean ? ' Sally stuck to her guns . I know it means that prices are down today  --  and that they 'll be up again next week . ' Well  --  will they ? ' said Alan . That 's the question . Dad says they will . He 's been saying all month that this was a Fire Sale , and he 's been picking up bargains right and left . But I do n't know . Babson 's been predicting a decline ; but he 's been a Cassandra for nearly a year . All the big New York Boys seem to agree with Dad . Last week Charles E. Mitchell , of the National City Bank , said  --  I remember his very words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely sound and our credit situation is in no way critical . " President Hoover got off the line , " The fundamental business of the country , that is , production and distribution of commodities , is on a sound and prosperous basis . " Dad says the Federal Reserve System could absolutely stop a panic . It would certainly seem as if Grade A stocks had reached extremely attractive levels on a high yield basis . But just the same  --  they keep on falling . They 've been falling since early September . Last Wednesday was an awful day . Thursday was worse . ' But things went up on Friday , ' said Sally consolingly . Alan looked irrationally annoyed . And why did they go up ? ' he asked . Because a pool of New York bankers had pegged the market . They met in the Morganp324offices  --  six men , representing six banks  --  Morgan and Companyand the National City and the Guaranty Trust and the Bankers ' Trust and the First National and the Chase National  --  and they put up a cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it then , but how often can they do it ? The trading that day was nearly thirteen million shares . And today it broke again . Maybe the bankers were realizing on their good intentions . I do n't know . Of course Dad says this is just a sinking spell . He says the investors of today will profit handsomelywhen this hysteria is over and people stop to think of the fundamental stability of the economic conditions in this country . But , just the same , he 's worried . I should have stayed in with him . ' He should have come out with you , ' said Sally sympathetically . Then , after a little pause , Honestly , Alan , I think you need a vacation . ' She smiled at him , persuasively . His eyes , meeting hers , slowly returned the smile . I know I do , Sally , but 3'Listen , Alan , ' said Sally eagerly , I need a vacation myself . I 'm awfully sick of housekeeping and parties and  --  and people . ' She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then quickly , as Alan opened his mouth to reply : Do n't speak ! just listen to me ! This flurry will soon be over . You 've lived through flurries before . And when it is  --  let 's go away . Let 's go away till Christmas . Let 's take a trip . We have n't been off on a spree together for nearly three years . I 've been thinking , Alan  --  thinking about us  --  a  --  a good deal lately '  --  Sally 's voice was faltering . I 'm really worried . We ought to  --  to have more fun . Let 's leave the boys with Mother  --  she 'd simply love it  --  and close the house and go to Italy . Sail early in November and have eight weeks over there  --  seven , anyway  --  and come home just in time to trim the Christmas tree . I 'd like to sail to Naples and go to Sicily  --  we 've never been there  --  and on up to Rome and Florence , with maybe a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genoa and then sail for home . It would be lovely , Alan ' Sally 's eyes and voice were pleading . After a moment  --  It would be lovely , all right , ' said Alan.  |p325He  rose then , and cast aside his paper . He took a few turns up and down the rug . Sally 's eyes followed him wistfully . Then wistfully wandered over the pleasant lamplit room . Pale panelled walls  --  some books  --  old polished furniture  --  green chintz with yellow flowers  --  flowers , too , chrysanthemumswhich Rose had brought over from Mr. MacLeod 's greenhouse , on the gate-legged table  --  Alan 's armchair and her own , drawn up beside the fire . It had the simple charm of familiar domesticity . The homely attraction of all lived-in rooms . Sally thought , smiling , of Granny 's Cass Street parlour . Times had changed and with them the attitude toward parlours . But she had a lot of Granny in her . She had not moved an object in her living-room since she had moved into it herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As it had always been . Just the same she would like to leave it and run off to Italy . Alan stopped his pacing and paused beside her chair . I 'd like to do it , Sally , if I could --  ' But you can , Alan ! ' cried Sally stoutly . All you need to get off with is a point of view . ' Alan shook his head . Dad needs me , ' he said , rather drearily . The bank --  ' Oh , for Heaven 's sake ! ' cried Sally disgustedly . If your father and mine and Baines and Georgie and all those second vice-presidents ca n't run that bank  --  especially with the advicethat Uncle George keeps giving them on the side  --  for eight weeks 3'It 's not that exactly , ' said Alan soberly . Dad  --  Dad kind of depends on me . You know your father never takes much responsibility . And Baines is the lily of the bond department  --  he toils not , neither does he spin . Georgie 's all right  --  except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfere with business  --  but he 's only twenty-six years old . Dad 's run that bank like a one-man show , from the day your grandfather died . But lie needs someone , close to him , to help him  --  to run his intellectual errands -- 5'Just the same , ' said Sally , he 'd be glad to let you go for eight weeks . He 'd be the first to say it would do you good . If you do n't want to , I 'll put it up to him . '  | Oh  --  he 'd say to go , all right . But --  He turned to resume his pacing . Alan , darling ' He paused to look back at her , standing still , with drooping shoulders , in the centre of the rug . Then smiled ruefully , his tired face softening . Sally , ' he said , you 're right . I guess you do n't have much fun . It 's hell the way we live and I do n't know why we do . It 's not the way I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' said Sally . It 's queer . Just to look at us , anyone would say we had everything  --  we 're young and we 're healthy and we have money and leisure  --  at least we could have leisure , if we had the sense to take it  --  and the house is nice and the children are darlings  --  and we have n't had any real tragedy except Sam 's death . But in spite of all that , we do n't really enjoy ourselves  --  we do n't enjoy each other . It 's as if we could n't . I do n't understand it . ' Alan was still looking at her . After a moment , Sally , ' he said , abruptly , you look so pretty  --  in that yellow thing  --  with your red hair in the lamplight -- I'Why  --  Alan ! ' said Sally amazedly . Confusedly , too . It was a long time since Alan had said anything to her like that . You do . ' Alan sounded almost embarrassed . Sally did not blame him . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his own wife . But he walked over to her and sat down on the arm of her chair and put his arm around her shoulders . Sally  --  we  --  we 've wasted a lot of time , lately . ' I know we have , Alan . ' I 've been so busy . It 's just this  --  this damn ' Prosperity , ' smiled Sally . Alan laughed . I guess that 's just what it is ! ' But , Alan  --  what 's the use of prosperity if you do n't enjoy it ? ' I do n't know . You always think you 're going to . ' Well , we are going to . Right now . Promise me you 'll speak to your father about the trip tomorrow . ' Alan smiled  |p327If  the market steadies . ' No . Even if it does n't . The market never steadies . If it is n't going down , it 's going up . ' Now , you 're talking like a woman again . ' But Alan was still smiling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' Alan 's hand tightened on Sally 's shoulder . She loved to feel it there . She leaned back against his arm and smiled slowly , luxuriously , up at him . That smile , she felt , with a little rush of emotion , was positively wanton . And she meant it to be . Alan so seldom cared if she smiled . Then treat me like one . ' That was wanton , too . Alan was bending over her , his mouth trembling a little . She held her head back deliberately , steadily , and looked , for an instant , straight up into his eyes . She saw the little black circles around the blue-grey iris and thought , fleetingly , of the moment when she had first seen them  --  on the fallen log in the pine copse at Broadmoor-on-Hudson  --  twelve years ago and more . Alan 's face came nearer . You bet I will ! ' His lips met hers . Then drifted slowly over her cheek to the curls behind her ear . Sally shivered uncontrollably . Then presently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did not raise his head . You will speak to your father ? Tomorrow ? ' Perhaps . ' His voice was low and a little vague . But Sally 's was persistent . And you 'll go to the steamship lines ? You 'll see what'ssailing ? Tomorrow morning ? ' He did not answer . Alan , darling  --  it would n't commit you to look up a boat . ' No . ' His voice was smiling now . So you will ? ' There was a little pause . Then Alan sighed . A brief sigh of decision . Yes . I will . ' But Sally persevered . Promise ? ' I promise . '  |p328Then  Sally sighed . A long-drawn sigh of relief . He kissed her again . She realized how tense her whole body had been as she felt it slowly relaxing . After a moment , Comfort 's blue sweater and the amber knitting-needles dropped unheeded to the floor . Was that the telephone ? ' called Sally , over the bannisters . No , ma'am , ' Clara 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back door . ' Funny , thought Sally , glancing at her wrist watch . Ten minutes since the last time she had glanced at it . It was half after two , and Alan had promised , before leaving her that morning , that he would go straight to the steamship companies after seeing his father at the bank . He would telephone , not later than eleven , and tell her just what his father had said and what sort of a stateroom he had found on what boat . All morninglong she had stayed at home to hear from him . She had lingered near the telephone , as if the very proximity of the little black instrument could make his call more imminent  --  could prolong and intensify the feeling of his nearness , that nearness which , after months of something very like estrangement , had been so simply and so happily established last night . That morning , waking by his side , as she had not done for months , she had lain quietly , listening to the twittering of the sparrows in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far apart they had insensibly drifted . Thinking of how she had not realized , with all her worry , the distance between them , until that distance had shrunk to nothing  --  had vanished  --  once Alan 's troubled defences , and her own , had been broken down and they had come together again in a rush of mutual confidence and intimacy . Then Alan had wakened , too , and had kissed her  --  even before looking at the watch under his pillow  --  and they had talked of the trip to Italy and of leaving the children and of how hard that would be , but how good for her mother to have the boys with her and  --  and breakfast had been almost like a bridal breakfast , in spite of the presence of Sam and little Alanp329and the hurry of getting Sam off for school and the fuss that Alan always made over eating his cereal , and when it was over Alan had said that he wished he could take a later train , but he must catch the eight o'clock , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  unless he was in conference with Sally 's father and Stephen Carver in the club car  --  and that he would go to the steamship offices and telephone her , surely , not later than eleven . And now , it was half-past two and she had been at home all morning and she had broken a luncheon engagementwith Cora  --  like a bride , positively  --  to hear Alan 's voice . Yet he had not telephoned and she , curiously enough , and rather like a bride again , had not wanted to call him , if he did not call her . She had been thinking of Alan all morning  --  happy , excited thoughts  --  such as she had not thought about him for years . Sally stood deliberating at the top of the stairs . After all , she reflected , there was no use pushing this bridal business to extremes . Why should she not call Alan and find out what had happened ? Mr. MacLeod could not have objected . The steamers could not be full  --  at least , though the travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on something . Sally walked slowly back into her room . She stood looking at the telephone for a moment in silence . Then abruptly sie picked up the receiver and sat down on the edge of her bed . Central two  --  one hundred , ' she said . She wondered if Alan would be back in his office after lunch at the club . The voice of the girl at the switchboard of the Farmers ' Loan and ' Trust Company ticked briskly in her ear . Central two  --  one hundred . ' Can I speak to Mr. Alan MacLeod , Junior . Mrs. MacLeod speaking . ' One moment , Mrs. MacLeod . I 'll connect you . ' Then the voice of Alan 's middle-aged secretary  --  quiet , competent , and controlled . Mr. MacLeod 's office . ' Oh , Miss Butler  --  this is Mrs. MacLeod . Is Mr. MacLeod there ? '  |p330He  's not in his office , Mrs. MacLeod . But I think he 's in the building . Will you hold the wire while I find him ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banker 's wife  --  do n't disturb him if he 's in conference . ' No , Mrs. MacLeod . ' Then silence . Then more silence . Sally sat idly drawing little squares and rectangles and circles on her telephone pad . Unconsciously she printed the word Italy . ' Then retraced it . Then noticed what she had written . She was thinking of the little naked Italian boys who dived for pennies in the transparentwater of the Naples harbour  --  of Naples itself , tan , pink , and yellow plaster , crookedly climbing its precipitous hill  --  of San Martino above it , and Paestum and Pompeii  --  and of the cone of Vesuvius , breathing a pale grey feather of smoke into the stainless azure of the sky  --  of twisted streets , hilly roads , and little ruined courtyards  --  of the wash of the Italians , hung picturesquely askew against weather-beaten facades  --  of dirt and disorder and decay , all bathed in the mellow gold of the Italian sunshine . She was laughing , as she remembered what her father had said about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's like a bad painting  --  the kind that no one has been interested in for at least thirty years ! '  --  when she heard a click in her ear . Then Alan 's hurried voice . Hello ! ' Hello , darling , ' said Sally softly . Yes . Hello . What is it , Sally ? ' Close-clipped brevity rang in Alan 's tone . What is it ? ' Sally sat upright on her bed , in her surprise . Yes . ' Why , Alan , I just called up to ask you what your father said  --  to find out about the boats . Did you forget  --  ? ' She heard Alan laugh , shortly . Forget ? That 's putting it mildly . You do n't know what 's happened . ' What has ? ' asked Sally anxiously . Something , obviously , that had changed materially Alan 's mood . The market 's crashed . '  |p331Oh  , Alan ! ' Sally 's tone was indignant . But  --  crashed , Sally . I mean  --  it 's hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know  --  it never does . ' It does  --  it 's doing it . Yesterday was nothing . They 're dumping  --  dumping everything . It 's fearful down here . They 're calling all the loans . ' Who is ? ' Everyone . Corporations who made them . People , too . Margins have simply vanished . Collateral 's wiped out . Dad 's wild  --  but he 's wonderful . He 's taking over every loan he can . He says we 've got to stop it . ' Stop what ? ' The panic . ' I thought you said that there would never be one . Where 's the Federal Reserve Board ? ' Oh , Sally ! '  --  impatiently  --  ' You do n't understand . ' Then , as an afterthought , after an instant of silence , Baines is mopped up . ' Baines ? ' He lost ninety thousand dollars in twenty minutes this morning . ' Nine-ty thou-sand dol-lars ! ' Yes . By coming down late to his job . He had Bendix Aviationon a margin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank . A broker called up from Alfred Baker 's  --  but Dad was over at the Midland , talking to Carver , and your father had stepped over to the Stock Exchange for a moment to try to get some dope  --  the tape was behind , of course  --  and I was in Uncle George 's office , conferring about those damn skyscraper bonds . They got Georgie , and Georgie did n't know whether he ought to cough up the additional margin or not  --  over twenty thousand , it was  --  so they sold Baines out . You should have heard him when he drifted into his office about a quarter to twelve ! I thought there 'd be murder done . ' But , Alan  --  how terrible ! ' Oh , I do n't know . Teach him to get up early . More terrible things than that are happening . I 've got to go now , Sally . ' But , Alan  --  did you speak to your father ? '  | Of course I did n't ! Sally how can you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was crashing when we got in here . The market opens at nine , Chicago time . They were standing in line to unload , I guess , on Wall Street . You could n't hear the gong for the crash ! We 've been out of our minds , all day . And I 've got to go now , Sally . ' Well  --  all right , ' said Sally spiritlessly . She heard the click of Alan 's receiver . Slowly , she hung up her own . She read the word Italy , ' on her telephone pad . She wondered if she were going to cry . That would be silly  --  but the tears were pricking behind her eyelids . Tears of anger , however . Anger at Alan and at the world of men . How could they carry on so  --  about money ! About just more money - or a little less . Still  --  ninety thousand dollars . Uncle Lambert would kill Baines . She did not understand at all what Alan had said about loans and margins and corporations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatically definite , even if you could only visualize , vaguely , the way in which it had been lost . Sally did not cry . She picked up her knitting , instead , and strolled downstairs to throw herself , dispiritedly , into her armchairin the living-room . Three o'clock . Little Alan was still taking his afternoon nap . Sam would soon come roistering home from school and then she would take them both for a walk on the beach . That would cheer her up . The beach was always peaceful . The level lake , the level sands , the straight , clear line of the horizon cutting the empty water from empty sky . The world shut off by the high bank of the willow and poplar and sumach-clad bluff . The children , skipping stones and begging to go in wading , even in the chilly waves of the twenty-ninth of October . It would cheer her up , but her resentment against Alan would linger . Of course , now , he would not go to Italy . That was painfully clear . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was the perfect time to go . The market was foolish enough , when you were making money on it . When you were losing it , why not get out and call it a day ? But Alan would n't . He would not even listen to her . When Alan came home  --  on a late train again  --  last night would be as if it had never been.  |p333If  she even so much as referred to it they would quarrel and they would argue . Well  --  she would not refer to it , thought Sally grimly . But she would look at Alan . She would look at him with her mind 's eye in the pitiless light of cold feminine logic . And what she would see would make her very much annoyed . Two diamonds , ' said Maisie . Two hearts , ' said Cora . Three without , ' said Gertrude Sewall . Pass , ' said Sally . Pass , ' said Maisie . Pass , ' said Cora , glancing ruefully at Sally , one eyebrow lifted comically in despair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's French drawing-room , close to the crackling fire . They had sat there for two hours . Three cigarettes were poised on the rims of the green glass ash-trays on the green baize table-top , their little blue columns of smoke rising steadily in the quiet air . Maisie was fitting her cigarette into a long jade holder . Sally led the two of hearts and then , abandoning all further responsibility for it , leaned back in her chair and looked out the nearest long French window . The Skokie valley stretched , flat and uninteresting , a greyish sheet of snow , under the grey February sky . Low in the west , however , the clouds were broken , giving promise of a troubled sunset . The sun shone through them , now and then , in long amber rays  --  the kind of rays that angels walked on in Italian paintings . Maisie laid down her hand . I 'm glad to see that ten of clubs , ' said Gertrude reflectively . We 've got them licked . ' Her square , strong-fingered hands  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  picked up the first trick . Hands , Sally thought , were interestitig . At the bridge table they always kept her mind off the game . Gertrude 's hands were capable  --  they would stand no ionsense . And she had stood no nonsense from Baines . Maisie 's were soft and white , with long , double jointed , tapering fingers ,  | tipped with red-lacquered , convex , delicately ovalled nails  --  feline hands , with claws , Sally thought charitably , that were stronger than they seemed . Cora 's were thin and narrow and nervous , with a faint line of ink at the nail 's edge of the second , right-hand finger . Her own  --  well , her own were just hands . Small , compact , short-fingered  --  rather childlike . Sally knew them too well to be interested in their story . Perhaps their rings told it better than their conformation  --  the sparkling solitaire and slim platinum band of her engagement and wedding rings , and the gleaming star sapphire , which always made her think of the night when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a hint of warning . Oh  --  excuse me ! ' said Sally , snatching up her three of spades . There was no doubt about it  --  to play bridge , even adequately , you needed an untroubled mind . That was probablywhy Maisie was so good at it . Nothing ever troubled Maisie . Gertrude , too , was invariably serene . Thoughts did not worry her . She had merely stood Baines as long as she wanted to stand him , and , when she had divorced him , she had not given a damn what anyone thought . She did not give a damn now what Aunt Adelaide was thinking or what Uncle Lambert 's parishioners were whispering . It amused her to have Baines once more on the run . Maybe she was living with him . Sally did n't know  --  did n't care either . It did not seem very important . Game and rubber , ' said Gertrude briskly , throwing down the last four cards in her hand . Maisie takes my seven with her queen of diamonds and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and picked up her brown silk purse . Gertrude lit a fresh cigarette . Maisie was adding the score card . Sally stood up and put her hands on her hips and stretched , luxuriously . Why did she play bridge , she wondered , when she was always so glad when a game was over ? Why did she lunch with Maisie , when she hated her ? Why had n't she the spine to say to herself , and to Alan , too , that she would never enter Maisie 's house again ? Still  --  another afternoon was gone . She lit a cigarette herself , and walked over to a window and stood looking out at the Skokie valley . In winter you couldp335not say much for the Ridge view . Illinois began , abruptly , beyond the cream plaster wall and balanced cedar trees of Maisie 's French garden  --  and , in February , Illinois was not beautiful . Just empty fields and scrub oaks and barbed-wire fences , contrasting absurdly with the formal paths and symmetricalhedges and eighteenth-century sundial in the immediateforeground . Space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lovely sky , cold blue in patches , between the broken , slate-coloured clouds and luminous near the sun , which was sinking rapidly toward the flat horizon . Eleven dollars , we owe them , Sally , ' said Cora . Get it out of my purse , ' said Sally . Want a highball ? ' asked Maisie . The inevitable tray of drinks was waiting on a console near the door . Just White Rock , ' said Sally . A highball for me  --  weak , ' said Cora . Then , mechanically , We all drink too much . ' Maisie was tinkling ice and pouring liquid at the table . Gertrude Sewall yawned . When is Kathleen 's baby coming , Cora ? ' she asked . August , ' said Cora . She sounded a little surprised . Who told you about it ? ' Baines , ' grinned Gertrude . He 's quite sentimental on the subject . There 's no sentimentalist like a confirmed rake . ' I did n't know Baines knew , ' said Cora . I suppose Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all worked up over it at the Rectory . Question of baptism . I call them a trifle pre-mature . ' Does she like it ? ' asked Maisie . Who ? Kathleen ? ' said Cora . She 's crazy about it . After all  --  she 'll soon be twenty-nine . ' So far it 's really successful , is n't it ? The marriage . ' Gertrude'stone was dispassionate . ' Of course it 's successful , ' said Cora rather rudely . Maisie laughed , as she passed the tall glasses . She was not one to be rebuffed by rudeness . Well  --  they 've only been married five months . '  | Kathleen loves the way they live , ' put in Sally , somewhat primly . Really ? ' Why would n't she ? ' said Cora . She has a lovely apartment , overlooking the East River , and she 's had such fun , fixing it up . She 's done it Early American . That was rough on Mother . ' Cora 's humour was getting the better of her rudeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother was almost ready to let bygones be bygones for the pleasure of prowling up and down the Madison Avenue antique shops with Kathleen . But not quite . Anyway , Kathleen writes that it 's charming . Maurice designed a ship room  --  you know , maps on the wall and old charts . He collects whaling curios  --  carved ivory and ship models and those coloured glass globes they hang on fish nets and Maurice Edelstein collects whaling curios ? ' Gertrude 's voice was incredulous . Cora nodded . The Metropolitan has its eye on his harpoons . It 's the best collection in the country , they say , outside of New Bedford --  ' How comic ! ' said Gertrude . Granny loves it , ' said Sally . You see my grandfather 's fatherwas the son of a second mate on a New Bedford whaler  --  ' Gertrude laughed . And I dare say that Edelstein 's grandfather pushed a friedfishcart in the Ghetto ! ' Cora looked at her coldly . They 're very nice people , ' she said severely . And they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very handsomeand highbrow  --  and she knows the most interesting people What sort of people ? ' asked Maisie curiously . Oh  --  the sort of people that Kathleen never met before . Writers and artists and economists . Her husband  --  Felix Strauss  --  you 've heard of him Never , ' said Maisie promptly . Well  --  he 's one of the props of the New Republic ' I never see it , ' said Maisie . I have to bootleg it myself , ' said Cora parenthetically.  |p337Father  considers it the organ of the Reds . And to read Felix Strauss 's articles you would think the world was coming to an end . He 's thumbs down on optimism . ' Cora was laughing a little . Last week he lit into Hoover and Lamont and Andy Mellon , and I bet they 're rubbing arnica on the bruises yet ! He 's all against this present rise in the market . In print , Gloomy Gus is simply his middle name . But Kathleen says in the home circle he 's a riot  --  fat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken heart ! She gets on grandly with him , and she likes the Ethically Cultured uncle . And she 's crazy about the theatre . She says it 's all so friendly . Maurice 's new show is a wow . The opening night Kathleen did n't know herself . She wrote that she was covered with orchids like a corpse ! It 's all so lavish and  --  and goodnatured . Easy-going and generous . It 's just what Kathleen needs . ' Well , ' sighed Maisie , I could do without the highbrows . But I suppose the theatre is amusing . ' It 's more than amusing , ' said Sally suddenly . She was deeply interested in what had happened to Kathleen . This spring Maurice is going over to conduct his orchestra in London . Kathleen 's going with him . She thinks she 'll have her baby in Berlin . Maurice is planning some work with Max Reinhardt and they want to go to Salzburg for the music festival and All in all , ' said Cora ironically , it 's a pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And now , I 'm going home . Ready , Sally ? ' Oh , yes , ' said Sally . See you tonight , ' said Maisie , at the dance . ' Yes , ' said Sally . I suppose we 'll be there . We 're dining with Rose . ' So are we , ' said Maisie . That was stupid of Rose , thought Sally swiftly , but of course Lakewood was a small place . Night after night , you met the same people at different parties . It was , perhaps , consoling to reflect that it had not occurred to Rose not to ask Maisie and Alan to dinner together . Tell Alan , ' laughed Maisie , to be in good form . ' Sally picked up her coat . Maisie helped her into it . Her voice came coolly from over its fur collar . Of late , I do n't think his form has been so awfully good . ' Sally was glad to hear it . However  --  He 's been worried , ' she said defensively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now , that President Hoover has restored public confidence . He thought those things that he and Mr. Mellon said were grand . Mr. MacLeod says that the panic was only psychological and the market has really turned --  ' Baines thinks so , ' said Gertrude . He got in again in the sub-basement , and everything he 's bought has gone steadily up . ' Well  --  I would n't tie to Baines , ' said Cora , in a financial crisis , but Father says that when Andy Mellon predicts a revival of business , that revival will come . He 's absolutely wise to Wall Street . ' By this time they were standing at the front door . Cora opened it and the chill breeze of the late February afternoon swept in over the tiled floor . Maisie shivered and hugged her bare arms in the loose , fluttering sleeves of her chiffon house dress . I wish they 'd stop it , ' said Sally suddenly . Stop what ? ' asked Gertrude . She was struggling into her fur coat . The market . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they ought to . I wish they could sell stocks and bonds at a governmentbank . Prix fixes , as they say on the Rue Saint-Honorc . No fluctuation . Alan says I 'm crazy . ' You are , darling , ' said Cora firmly . She ran down the stone steps and opened the door of her car . Hop in . Can I take you , Gertrude ? ' No . My car 's in the garage . ' Cora was racing her motor uproariously , to warm up her engine . See you tonight ! ' called Maisie . The Chrysler started , with a few consumptive coughs . It rolled jerkily down the drive . Cora drove like a fool . Alanp339would never ride with her . He had more feeling for the sensibilitiesof an engine , Sally thought bitterly , than for the sensibilities of a wife . He knew , instinctively , when an engine was feeling unhappy . Her eyes were fixed moodily on the sunsetsky . It was violent , vivid  --  rose , gold , and purple halfway to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presently , Cora , ' she said , we 're all insane . We did n't learn a thing by that smash in October . ' Sure we 're insane , ' said Cora . That 's what Kathleen writes . She says it 's such a relief to live with people who are n't making money off other people 's mistakes . Maurice writes a show and sells it to the public . If the public does n't like it , it 's free to turn it down . If it does , everything 's Whoopee ! ' And it always does , ' said Sally . He 's never had a flop . ' Yes . He 's clever , all right . And Sally  --  he 's kind . ' Somethingslightly tremulous in Cora 's tone made Sally turn to lookat her cousin . I have n't told you what he 's been doing for me . ' What 's he been doing ? ' Well ' The Chrysler was running quite smoothly by thistime . Cora leaned back and stretched her long legs and settled herself at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Kathleen told him about my novel . ' Your novel ? ' said Sally , with interest . And he wrote me about it and I  --  I sent it to him . Funny , was n't it , when I had n't shown it to any of the family ? But he seemed somehow  --  professional . ' Sally nodded understandingly . And then ? ' Well  --  he read it and he showed it around  --  he knows a lot of publishers , you know  --  and he made them read it . ' Yes , ' said Sally breathlessly . And  --  ' Cora 's eyes were fixed steadily on the road in front of the Chrysler . She drew a long breath . And they all said it was no good . ' Oh , Cora ! ' cried Sally , in vivid disappointment . Maurice did n't think it was any good himself . So , ' said Cora firmly , I guess it is n't . I  --  I never really thought that itp340was . I tried to think so and it  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had believed in it , Sally , I would have wanted to read it to all of you . I never wanted to . I was rather ashamed of it . I guess it 's just tripe . ' How can it be ? ' said Sally . You write the grandest letters . ' I know I do , ' said Cora . I 'm very proud of them . And that 's just what Maurice said . He thought the novel would be good because he 'd read my letters to Kathleen . And then , it was n't . But , Sally , that man 's a darling . He took those letters around  --  parts of them  --  and showed them to  --  to editors . And he wrote me they all said I had a gift . Not a gift for fiction , obviously  --  just a gift for comment . Nothing important . But still  --  a friend of his on the New Yorker is willing to give me a job  --  just a trial job  --  to see if I can hold it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrilling ! ' Yes . Is n't it ? ' said Cora simply . Kathleen wants me to come on , right away . She 's found a little two-room flat for me with a kitchenette , just around the corner from her and Oh , Sally ! I 'm nearly thirty-one ! I 've never had a door I couldlock between me and Mother --  ' The steering-wheel wobbled disconcertingly , but Sally did not notice it . She was wondering how she could endure her life , if she had to give up Cora . ButYou ought to go , ' she said valiantly . But , Sally  --  think of Mother . Think of Father . Father 's sixty-five . It nearly killed them  --  what Kathleen did . Father really loves Billy  --  I almost do , myself  --  and Mother  --  well , I sometimes think that Mother will never be the same again . I suppose she will be , because there 's something indestructible in her , that you have to take your hat off to , even if you do n't admire it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't right , at her age  --  recalling all those wedding invitations and returning all those presents  --  and half the bewildered donors , when they heard of the elopement , sending them back again ! And explaining , Sally  --  endlessly explaining  --  wherever she went . To nit-wits . Well , you know how it was . We all had to go through it . But , I tell you , Mother still wo n't go out to parties . She says she ca n't hold up her head . And when Mother won'tp341go to a party , it 's the acid test ! Of course she ought to go abroad and  --  and take a cure or something . But Father ca n't leave the real estate business in the state it 's in now . I ought to go with her . That 's what I ought to do  --  just spend the spring in Bad-something-or-other and let the New Yorker slide . But -- Cora , do n't you do it ! ' cried Sally , with violence . For thirty years , you 've been the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll ever live without you  --  but just you strike off your shackles ! Go , while the going 's good ! Do n't listen to anyone ! Except to Maurice ! That man is an angel ! ' Is n't he ? ' said Cora devoutly . Think  --  if Kathleen had n't married him , this would never have happened to me . And he acts as if it were nothing  --  standing over editors with a shotgun while they read my lyric prose ! And he 's really so hopeful  --  if you call it hopeful . He says all that I 'll have to do is to be consistently funny ! ' Well , you 've been that , ' said Sally stoutly , from the day you were born . Under adverse circumstances , too , mostly . ' Cora laughed . If I could just break away from the family , I 'd feel as funny as Will Rogers ! I 'd never think a solemn thought again ! But , Sally --  " Yes , ' said Sally . My thoughts are solemn now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said Sally slowly . Cora was not looking at her . Her eyes had returned to the highroad in front of the car . After a moment , she went on , hesitantly : I sometimes think you  --  you need me , Sally . That sounds conceited , I know . But  --  well  --  I think I understand . I think I see things that  --  that trouble you . They may keep on troubling you . ' Sally sat a moment in silence . When she spoke , she was surprised to find that her own voice was quite steady . And they may not . ' Yes . ' Cora 's voice was doubtful . But if they do , they 're not things that you can talk over with  --  just anyone . '  | Sally proudly lifted her head . I 've never talked them over with you . ' We do n't have to talk , ' said Cora gently . A lifetime of affectionstood behind her words . No , ' said Sally . Then , breaking a little pause , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much , ' said Cora eagerly , and if  --  if ' things are too troubling , you must come to me . You must just light out and come . ' Sally smiled . And ask Maurice for a job ? ' I bet he could get you one ! ' Sally shook her head . No . I 'll never do that . You  --  you must n't exaggerate , Cora . I think I sometimes exaggerate , myself . It 's just that we 've always been such a  --  such a domestic family . ' Except for Baines . ' Oh  --  Baines ! ' Sally 's tone was scornful . Cora was negotiating the turn into the Sewall drive . The roof of Sally 's house showed up beyond the oak copse . Another turn and the house itself came into view . Its white walls loomed palely in the early twilight . Above the front door , the old ship 's lantern was already lit . Windows gleamed yellow behind drawn curtains . On the nursery shade , in the east window , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , then vanished . Sam 's sled was on the snowy terrace . Cora stopped the car . Sally got out of it . She stood , for a moment , on her doorstep and looked at her cousin . Cora , ' she said very seriously , it 's only your own fault if your life is not a success . I 'm sure of that . The moments come , though you may not always recognize them , when you take the right or the wrong turn . Your moment 's now . Opportunity 's knocking . Open the door . ' Cora looked steadily at her , for a moment , without replying . Then , I will , ' she said briefly , and engaged the gears . They scraped a little . Sally , I 'll miss you . ' You bet you will ! ' smiled Sally courageously . We 'll missp343each other . But we 're grown up . We have to be about our business . Do n't worry about my business . Remember '  --  Sally was still smiling  --  remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick glance of appreciation for her cousin 's gallantry , Cora put her car in motion . It moved off , jerkily as usual , down Sally 's drive . Sally stood still on her doorstep , trying to realize what life would be like without Cora . She gave it up . She gave it up and opened her front door . She glanced at the hall clock . In two short hours they would be dining at Rose 's with Maisie . And Maisie would look like a dream . And Alan would hand her her cocktail and she would lay that hand , with the long , double-jointed , tapering fingers on his arm , and those nails would show up , red and convex and delicately ovalled on his black coat-sleeve  --  and Sally would want to tear out her big , brown , childishly wondering eyes , with her own finger-nails There was a clatter in the upper hall . Mummy ! ' called Sam . His voice was exasperated . Is that you ? Wo n't you keep Alan quiet ? I got ta do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on George Washington to celebrate his birthday ! What rhymes with cherry tree , Mummy ? ' Verity ! If you stretch a point ! ' called Sally blithely . And very appropriate . Send Alan downstairs to me . ' She heard the sound of little-boy shoes running up the hall  --  an opening door  --  a minor uproar in the nursery . Then Alan appeared at the top of the stairs . He descended slowly , one step at a time , his hand on the bannister . His little red head showed just above the rail . His eyes were wistful , his mouth was drooping . He looked aggrieved , as if in need of comforting . Sally dropped on her knees on the last step of the staircase . HeOwled forbiddingly , in comic resemblance to his father , then c , ist himself upon her . Sally laughed  --  or did she sob ? Her own need of comfort was forgotten as she caught him up in her arms.  |p344WELT.   --  good-bye , ' said Alan . Good-bye , ' said Sally coldly . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . He picked up his suitcase . Have a good time , ' she added scornfully . Alan looked annoyed . You 're a fool not to come . ' That 's a matter of opinion . ' Alan shrugged and turned away . Then paused again to volunteer the information . I 'll be home Tuesday night . ' Sally did not reply . After a moment , Alan muttered resentfully , Oh , for God 's sake ! ' And walked down the hall . She heard the front door open and close . Then , after an instant of silence , the slam of the door of a taxi and the rattle of its engine , as the cab moved off down the drive . So , thought Sally , he had actually gone . She had not thought that he would . At the last moment , she had told herself , he would relent  --  he would apologize . For Alan knew that she was right . He knew how she felt about Maisie . He knew that it was ridiculous to expect her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week-end . Just the kind of party that she hated  --  Maisie and Avery , Gertrude and Baines , three or four of those unattractive young parlour snakes that Maisie always had hanging around her , that Frenchman , probably , who had been in Washington on some government commission and had turned up in Chicago and had looked up Avery because he had known him at the Beaux Arts . Alan , having the nerve to tell her that it was hot in Lakewood ! As if that were why he wanted to go ! When all summer long she had not been able to persuade him to take a four weeks ' vacation , so that they could go with the boys to the seaside . She had not left him  --  had not wanted to  --  alone and weary and worried in the suburban heat  --  and now he was leaving her ! A wave of self-pity crashed over Sally 's head . Not a watery wave , how/ever . A wave of liquid fire , which augmented the crackling flame of her anger . Oh , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was hot . It was very hot . Sally walked over to the western windows of the living-room . Not a quiver of air was coming through the screens . The oak woods were breathless . The lawn was shimmering under the summer sun . The flowers were drooping in the terrace border . Sally pulled down the window-shades until they were level with the sills . The room looked cool  --  pale panelled , green chintz hung , the furniture in ecru linen covers  --  but it was really stifling . Sally felt exhaustedby the effort of walking to the windows . Her muslin gown was clinging damply to her shoulder blades and arms . Here she was , left alone in this shattering heat  --  in this empty house  --  for four September days . With the children , of course . Still burning with self-pity , Sally histrionically thanked God for the children . Then thought , triumphantly , of her ingenuityin sending them over to take luncheon with Rose . She could not have borne to have them on hand to witness her quarrel with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissimulation . But she had not thought he would go . He had , though , damn him ! Suddenly common sense came to her rescue . What , after all , had Alan done ? He had gone off for four days to a house-party at the Weewaukee Fishing Club . To a house-party to which she also had been decorously invited by an old  --  no , common sense revolted ! She could not  --  she would not  --  think of Maisie as an old friend ! She was , however . Twelve years ago , they had been very friendly . In the cold light of reason , Sally reflected that she had been , perhaps , hysterical . She might have accepted . She might have gone . She might have tagged along and talked to Avery , and to that silly , dapper frog , and to Baines  --  when he could not find Gertrude to talk to  --  and to all those dreadful young men ! She might have watched Maisie vamping Alan  --  playing him off against the parlour snakes Rage overcame her once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Nothing . And she had lost at least the appearance of control of the situation . She had lost , too ,  |p346the  opportunity of making Alan feel like a fool . For he was a fool  --  and no one knew that better than Maisie . She had undoubtedlybeen laughing about him with Gertrude all summer  --  telling her what he had said and what she had done and how he had fallen for it . Knowing what another woman must think of your husband  --  knowing that she knew that he was an ass to be so  --  so easy  --  that was perhaps the most humiliating thing about this whole humiliating affair . Sally shivered with distaste . Oh , she thought despairingly , why were men so naive ? It would do no good to tell Alan that Maisie was laughingat him up her sleeve . And , somehow , she did not want to tell him . She wanted to protect his pride . She had protected it , all this long , dreadful summer . Alan must be at Maisie 's by this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his taxi in the gravel rectangle , to change into Avery 's low-hung , yellow car . Or perhaps he would motor with Maisie , in her smart little black roadster , and let Avery follow after , with the tonneau full of the snakes ! The snakes would all be.there , anyway , on the doorstep , when Alan arrived , and Maisie would be giving them a stirrup cup  --  something cool and green and gin-ish , with mint in it  --  and she would be effective in sport clothes for the woods , with lots of pale pigskin hand luggage , and Baines would roll up with Gertrude in his Pierce-Arrow  --  and there would be drinks and jokes and more drinks and laughter ! By nine o'clock in the evening they would reach the fishing club  --  cool and dark and balsamy  --  a line of romantic log cabins around a little lake . And they would have a swim and a late supper and go out in canoes , maybe . That Frenchman could sing like a nightingale  --  like a Mauve Decade nightingale  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yvette Guilbert used to sing ! Oh , damn ! thought Sally , silently swearing once more . There was absolutely nothing to be said for her position and she had only herself to thank for it . She had been stupid . Anger was stupid , always . Alan did need a rest . He needed the pine woods . He needed a change , however brief , after the discouragingsummer spent watching the leaden market sinkp347sullenly from low to astonishing low . The brief boom of January , February , and March had soon exhausted its force . Stock prices had dropped , stock dividends were cut , bonds had defaulted . Weeds , higher than the little lot stakes in Chicago Hill Gardens , hid the small flags , once fluttering , red and gay , now hanging limply , rain-and-sun-faded to a dingy yellow . The agents ' Swiss chalets and Queen Anne cottages and Japanesepagodas were all in need of paint . Here and there , in the network of cement sidewalks , a single brick bungalow  --  red brick in front , common yellow brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a mortgaged monument to the nation 's dream . As likely as not a For Sale ' sign hung in its front window . Down on South Dearborn Street , the bank 's skyscraper was almost completed . Only its towers were not finished . Creeping with midget workmen , they rose defiantly above its granite bulk , above its twenty tiers of blank and empty windows , four slender skeletons of structural steel . Uncle George said hopefully that , when the tide turned , the lots would all be purchased , the windows occupied . Uncle George held stubbornly to the thought of the turning tide . Mr. MacLeod said that it would take time . They would have to build up the public confidence . Sally 's father said that the country had known panics before . Granny said , But not like this one  --  though , of course , no two panics are the same . ' Georgie said , You 'll see  --  in 1932 the nation will go Socialist . ' Aunt Cora said that , if it did , it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the family had done Al Smith a kindness in not voting for him in ' 28 . Cora wrote from New York that Felix Strauss was revelling in pessimism and that the editorial motto of the New Republic should be , Do n't blame me if it rains ! ' Cora  --  thought Sally . She would never grow accustomed to the loss of Cora . But the girl was having a grand time in New York . She loved her job , she loved her flat , she loved her cat : iiid her parrot . She had bought them both in a burst of sar- ( ic , nic humour , to establish her official status as an old maid . Slic had a coloured girl , who came in by the day to keep them company while she was at the office . She wrote that that was all that there was for the coloured girl to do . Housekeeping is nothing , ' one letter began . I do n't know what Mother has been fussing over all these years . ' She had worked through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a state of ecstasy . She had been consistently funny . Sally always thought she could recognize her unsigned pleasantries on the New Yorker 's printed page . She would not even take a brief vacation . She had stoically resisted the temptation to run over to Berlin for a few weeks when Kathleen 's baby was born . Kathleen 's baby was now four weeks old and the Edelsteins would soon be sailing home with her from Hamburg . Kathleen had cabled Cora , Daughter image of Maurice , ' and Cora had written Sally cheerfully that she called that breaking the bad news . It did seem too bad that Kathleen 's white-and-golden loveliness was not to be perpetuated . The child was named Sarah  --  ' For both her great-grandmothers , ' Kathleen had written suavely . Granny had loved that . She had said calmly , I presume that Mrs. Edelstein and I were both named for Abraham 's Sarah . ' She had made the Old Testament seem quite a family bond . At the news , Aunt Cora had no more than compressed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call of a grandchild . When the big row over Cora 's departure had died down , Sally had thought that Aunt Cora seemed definitely older . She was sorry for her , alone all day , in that big house . Georgic too , was causing her uneasiness . He was running around with a Vassar girl , whom he had met at Hull House . Aunt Cora did not care for that . She was the daughter of a professor of History at the University of Wisconsin  --  jean Howland , by name  - -  and a great friend of the La Follettes  --  which did not hell ) matters , as Uncle George called them communist revolutionists  --  and Sally liked her . She liked her pretty , practical matterof-factness . She liked her clean , cool , clear-cut mind . She was twenty-three years old and she was working for a Ph.D . degree in the Social Sciences at the University of Chicago . Sally had asked her out to Lakewood several times for a summer weekendand had always enjoyed her , in spite of the fact that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages , shep349made Sally feel old . Jean Howland and Georgie both impressedher as belonging to another generation  --  a younger , healthier , more rational one  --  a generation untouched by the post-War hysteria . She thought that jean would do Georgie good . She was keeping him out of the speak-easies , if only by taking him to the social settlements . Her father , so Sally understood , was an academic authority on the economic consequences of the War . Sally 's thoughts had wandered very far afield . They were recalled to Alan by the sight of his silk muffler , lying across the back of a living-room chair . In the acrimony of his departure , he had forgotten it . Too bad  --  for it might be cold , incredibleas that seemed in Lakewood , motoring after nightfall through the Wisconsin woods . Sally picked it up and folded it , with still somewhat resentful hands . She had made a mistake , very definitely , in not going with him . But it was not irrevocal ) le . He would be , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By that time she would have herself in hand . She would watch her step . She would try to be pleasant about the house-party . In the meantime , the three days of the Labor Day week-end , and one more day , stretched empty before her . Perhaps the heat would break . If it did , she would try to think of something pleasant that she could do with the children . With the children and with Uncle Fred and with Rose . A picnic , maybe . Uncle Fred was superb on picnics . He was superb with his nieces and his little great-nephews . He seemed rather to have adopted Rose as a niece . And he had been interested in Comfort from the day that he turned up from France with her , an armful of afghans in Rose 's arms . But perhaps the heat would not break . Ah , well  --  if it did not , Sally needed a good rest . Sally sat up in bed , in her coolest green chiffon nightgown , and wondered how she was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , beyond the screened walls of her sleeping-porch , hung heavy on their branches . They were like leaves made of lead . No birds were twittering , though it was not yet nine o'clock . The morning sunshine seemed pulling itself together , summoning all its potential reserves of light and heat and energy , with which to attack once more an exhausted and defenceless world . The children were quiet , subdued by the stifling night , eating breakfast with Emma on the diningporchon the shady side of the house . Sally had just rung for her breakfast tray . She was thinking of Alan in his bathing-suit , on a springboard , in the early morning coolness of the Wisconsin pine woods , stretching up his arms , standing on his toes , getting up his nerve to dive , to cut the cold lake water with a delicious , rippling sense of shock , to curve , to glide , arms still outstretched under its chill greenness , to the surface  --  the sunny rippled surface , which would have Maisie floating on it , somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Lorelei  --  no , Loreleis sat on rocks and combed their hair and sang .

Sally continued to hum , quite cheerfully . Ich glaube , die Wellen aerschlingen Am Ende Schiffer and Kahn ; Und das hat mit ihrem Singen Die Lorelei gethan ! ' As one man to another , Heine would have warned Alan . Clara appeared in the door with the breakfast tray and the thick edition of the Chicago Sunday Tribune . She placed them , respectfully , on Sally 's bed . Good morning , Clara . Goodness  --  look at that headline !

Timothy O'Hara Shot on Front Porch . ' The paper dropped from Sally 's nerveless hands . Her mind was blank with shock . Oh , no ! ' she thought . Oh , no ! It ca n't be Tim ! ' Then , slowly , How terrible ! How terrible ! ' She picked up the paper again . Her eyes ran rapidly over the column of print . The toll of Chicago 's gang murders was raised last night by one , when Timothy O'Hara , bootlegger , was shot down at his front door by a stream of machine-gun bullets which raked his front porch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his front steps . His assailants are described , by eye-witnesses to the crime , as three men in a Dodge sedan , which had been parked for some time at the curb of Argyle Street , about a block from O'Hara 's residence . The men are variously characterized as dark , short , and swarthy , but no identification has been made by the police . They are believed to be gangsters familiar with O'Hara 's domestic habits , as his wife stated that it was his custom to stand on his front porch for a few minutes every evening , prior to locking his front door for the night . The Dodge was observed by several bystanders to approach slowly down Argyle Street from the west , just as O'Hara came out of his house . He was apparently not looking for trouble , as he paid no attention to it , but walked down onto his lawn and turned off a sprinkler and had ascended his steps again and called a greeting to a neighbour , Mrs. Ole Swanson , who , with her daughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the machine gun opened fire on his back . He fell instantly and the car , which had not come to a full stop , rapidly accelerated and disappeared around the corner of Windsor Place , before the startled witnesses could take steps to arrest it . Miss Lilian Swanson informed the police that she looked for a license plate on the car and was not able to see one.  | O'Hara was a member of Red Kelly 's gang , recently involved in difficulties with the Salvatori brothers over the beer racket . The four Salvatoris , Angelo , Tony , Slippery Slim , and Tito  --  the latter recently released from the penitentiary at Joliet on the expiration of the sentence imposed on him for bombing Alderman Hermann J. Kaufman 's home two years ago  --  were found in the Roma Cafe on South Halsted Street and established satisfactoryalibis . Red Kelly , when questioned by the police , stated that he had no idea who the murderers might be and that he had never known that O'Hara had enemies .

Not Tim . Tim , who had never even carried a gun . Two-fisted Tim , they call him over at Kelly 's . ' She thought of Bee 's words . Red Kelly goes around , now , with a bodyguard . Been doing it for six months . I do n't like that . ' Bee  --  who was now maintaining the customary silence of gangland '  --  had said those words a year ago and more . She had spoken then of the Salvatoris . For two years , possibly , Tim had been playing with death . And now  --  he was dead . He was riddled with bullets . Bee 's Tim . Her Tim , too , Sally felt , in a rush of warm personal affection . Alan 's Tim . Tim , with a mind like a nervous fox terrier , that ran round them in circles and barked . Their good friend . Shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowards , over a miserable beer racket ! Sally pushed away her breakfast tray and rose slowly from her bed . Her knees were shaking a little . She pushed her damp hair off her forehead . She felt a little dizzy  --  from the heat , perhaps . Possibly from shock . She walked unsteadily into her bedroom and took down her telephone receiver . Sunnyside four  --  three , four  --  three , ' she said . I must wire Alan , ' she was thinking . I must wire him to come home for the funeral . ' Tim 's funeral . It was still unbelievable . Hello , ' said a strange , subdued voice , with a marked brogue , in her ear . This is Mrs. Alan MacLeod speaking , ' said Sally . I  --  I'vep353just seen the paper . I 'm an old friend of Mr. and Mrs. O'Hara . Can you tell me how Mrs. O'Hara is ? ' Mrs. MacLeod , is it ? ' The voice was heartier now . I 've often heard Bee talk of you . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm here doing what I can for the poor girl . Hex mother 's on the way from Kenosha , bringing Father Delaney with her . Bee would n't have her told till this morning . Tim 's family 's here  --  but they 're in a terrible state . The shock was fearful . Tim took care of them all . They 're no help at all , but I 'm doing what I can for the children , poor little things , and Kelly 's here too , standing off the press . Those reporters would snatch a corpse from its coffin . It 's fearful what they say to Bee  --  they push right in and ' How is she ? ' asked Sally . Oh  --  she 's wonderful . ' T was a black lie in the paper , about her being in a state of collapse . She told the children herself and she 's grand with Tim 's father . He 's an old man , now , and I 'm thinking this will break him entirely .

I tell you she 's wonderful . But I do n't think she 'll let the children go . She kind of depends on them . And the worst is over now . Carrying him in last night must have been fearful , all streaming with blood , and she not knowing was he dead or alive , till the neighbours ran for a doctor . And then , the police piling in  --  and the reporters . The undertakers were here all night , but they made him look lovely . It 's wonderful what they can do , now  --  a violent death like that and he with no preparation , God rest his soul !

Good-bye , Mrs. Kelly . ' She hung up the receiver . She felt as if she had known Mrs. Kelly for years . Already , Tim seemed dead . It was curious , how quickly you accepted the fact of death . When Sam had died , it had been just the same . But later  --  later , Sam had seemed to live again . And not only in memory . Sally still thought of Sam as a living personality . She thought of his thoughts going on  --  of his reactions to life  --  of the sharp personal flavour of his character . The people whom you really loved , lived with you , always , in that way , as long as you lived yourself . They were closer than the living , sometimes , because you could summon them , instantaneously , when you needed them , to your side . Sally stood for a moment , frowning thoughtfully at the telephone . Then took down the receiver and called Western Union . She dictated a telegram to Alan . Alan MacLeod , Esquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club , Chain Lakes , Wisconsin . Timothy O'Hara was '  --  Sally 's voice was shaking a little  --  was shot and killed last night by gangsters . I am going in to Bee now . Will wire again hour of funeral . ' Then , after a moment of poignant indecision , Love always , Sally . ' She hung up the receiver . In spite of the shadow of Tim 's death she felt a little happier  --  about Alan and about herself , too  --  because she had added those last words . She rang her bell . Clara , ' she said , when the maid appeared , I 've just had word that one of my best friends has been  --  is dead . I 'm going in town . Will you please order the car and , while I 'm dressing , go out into the garden and pick all the flowers . ' When Sally turned her roadster around the corner of Ashland Boulevard into Argyle Street , she was surprised to see a crowd of several hundred people , standing in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidewalk and the grass plot and the curbstone in the hot morning sunshine  --  men in shirtsleeves , girls in Sunday finery , women in bungalow aprons , children in overalls and bathing-suits and khaki  --  a thickpressedmass of humanity , staring up at the front door and windows of the house . Some of the men were shading their girls ' faces with the comic sections of the Sunday papers and fanning them with their straw hats . In the slim shade of the meagre plane tree in the grass plot , three ghoulish , middle/aged women were established on campstools . They were comparingthe facade of the bungalow with a photograph of it on the rotogravure page of the Tribune . They were eating Eskimo pies , which were being sold from an ice-cream wagon on the edge of the crowd , and pointing eagerly , with fat , chocolatedaubedfingers , to the front steps , where X marked the spot . A line of Ford and Dodge and Plymouth and Pontiac and Chevroletsedans were parked along the curb . The children were climbing on them , in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gate to the front yard was closed and guarded by a policeman . Inside the yard , some four or five young men , with cameras and cigarettes , were idly loitering , obviously the representatives of the nation 's press . Sally stopped her roadster at the corner . The sun was so hot that it had softened the asphalt pavement . The tires sunk heavily into it . As Sally walked down the block toward the house , with her arms full of garden flowers , the heat from the cement sidewalk radiated up into her face . When she reached the crowd 's edge , she had to push against moist shoulders to force her way through it . She was stopped by the policeman at the gate . I 've come to see Mrs. O'Hara , ' she said . I 'm an old friend . ' The crowd pressed closer in avid interest . The policeman regarded her suspiciously , but not unkindly . Sez you , sister , ' he remarked urbanely . Sally lifted her chin in an unconscious gesture of authority . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in conflict with the law . I 'm Mrs. Alan MacLeod , ' she said . A young man , with a notebook , turned up at the policeman 's elbow . I know the lady 's name , ' he said . His pencil was poised . Did you say you were a friend of Mrs. O'Hara 's ? ' Indeed I am , ' said Sally . A very old one . ' Then she noticed the pencil . She remembered the power of the press . Will you please let me pass ? ' she added to the policeman . A little reluctantly he opened the gate . The young man stepped up to her.  | Dreadful thing , is n't it ? ' he said sympathetically . Just what did you say your connection with the O'Haras was ? ' I did n't say , ' said Sally coldly . Then realized that she was facing a camera 's eye . The young man behind it was barring her path . She pushed by him indignantly . She heard the camera click as she walked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . The crowd on the sidewalk was moving and murmuring , as if it scented drama . As the reporters closed in on her , Sally saw the long sheaf of calla lilies on the right-hand side of the door . The reporters were asking questions . What was the name , miss ? ' Alan MacLeod , the banker ? ' Did she say she was his daughter ? ' Sally rang the doorbell in silence . The door was opened immediately , but the threshold was barred . It was barred by a burly , red-headed Irishman , in shirt-sleeves . A tall man , thicknecked , with broad , truculent shoulders  --  perhaps fifty years old . Blue-eyed , ruddy-gilled , his lips pursed up inscrutably , he looked down at her under his bushy red eyebrows . I 'm Mrs. MacLeod , ' said Sally . Come in . Come in , ' said the Irishman heartily , in a rich brogue . Then sotto-voce to the clustering reporters , You get to hell out of here ! ' He drew Sally into the hall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large , hard hand . There was a deep scar on the thumb and the back of it was covered with little bristling red hairs . Sally grasped it gratefully . She looked up at his flushed , weather-beaten face . A face that gave nothing away . I suppose you 're Red Kelly ? ' she said . I am . ' His smile was kindly  --  kindly and very tired . It softened , though it did not solve , the enigma of his face . I brought Bee these flowers . ' I 'll take them , ' said Red Kelly . I 'll see they 're put in water . ' Thank you , ' said Sally . I 'll take them in to Tim . He 's laid out in the parlour and Father Delaney 's with him . Father Delaney 's just come . He said he 'd like a few minutes alone with the body . He loved Tim like a son . My wife 's got the children upstairs and the family'sp357all in the dining-room . Bee said when you came you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , ' said Sally . She turned toward the staircase . Is Bee there ? ' She 's not . She 's with the family . But I 'll tell her . ' Sally mounted the stairs . At the landing she turned to look back over her shoulder . The door to the parlour was closed . As Red Kelly opened the one to the dining-room the sound of Irish voices rose in plaintive cadence . There 'll never be another like him ! ' she heard a woman say . She thought it was Bee 's mother , but she could not be sure . She had not seen Mrs. Connelly for years . The door to Bee 's bedroom stood open and Sally entered it . That bedroom had always seemed to her a little absurd . It , - vas not very large , but it was luxuriously furnished by a department store bedroom suite . ' Twin beds of grey painted wood , ornatelygarlanded , vaguely French in design . A chiffonier for Tim . A vanity ' for Bee , with a long oval mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rose-pink silk . Silk spreads on the beds , silk cushions on the sofa , silk curtains at the windows , rose-pink too , exactly matching in colour the rose-pink rug . Pink flowers on the wall-paper and , dotted about on them , bright-coloured prints of Watteau-ish ladies , archly suspended in swings or playing blind man 's buff with Watteauishgentlemen . You could not think of an interior less like Bee and Tim . Sally had always laughed at it , privately . She did not laugh at it now . It seemed the pathetic apotheosis of all that Tim had worked to achieve , and had achieved , for Bee . The goal of the Waukegan contractor 's son who had felt , as a lad , that he had to make good  --  else why had his father ever left Kilkenny ? She was standing at the vanity , ' looking at the old photograph of Tim in his khaki , that had been taken in Rockford , when she heard a step on the threshold . She turned quickly . Bee was standing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were good to come and to bring me those lovely flowers ! ' She took a step forward , wearily . Her stocky , thick-set figure was drooping with fatigue . Her broad face was white  --  gaunt with its high cheek-bones  --  her black eyes clouded with grief . She was wearing a black silk blouse and a black cloth skirt , a little too large and too long for her  --  hastily assembled mourning . Sally ran to her and took her in her arms . Of course I came ! I started as soon as I saw the paper . Oh , Bee  --  you poor child , how  --  how could you live through it ? ' Bee turned away from her and sat heavily down on the sofa . I did n't , ' she said simply . Her shoulders were bowed , her arms sagging , her hands lay loosely relaxed , the fingers upcurled , on her black knees . She turned her haggard face helplesslyup to Sally . Inside , I 'm just as dead as Tim . ' Bee '  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wish I could have been with you . All night  --  the shock , and the sorrow , and  --  and the arrangements . It must have been too terrible . In this heat --  " Has it been hot ? ' asked Bee dully . Tears came into Sally 's eyes . Bee , darling , you need someone to take care of you . ' Well  --  I 've lost that , now , ' said Bee . Her own eyes were tearless . And I 've lost it forever . You do n't know what Tim was like  --  not even you , Sally  --  never a thought for himself  --  always planning for others  --  ' Her voice died away . Sallysat in silence , still holding that relaxed hand . Presently Bee spoke again . She did not look at Sally . Her eyes were fastened on the pink rug at her feet  --  fastened as if in horror on some sight that Sally could not see .

She was thinking of the Salvatoris . Presently , Bee , ' she whispered , Bee  --  do you know who did it ? ' Bee raised her eyes , slowly , reluctantly , to meet Sally 's gaze . I do n't , Sally . And I 'm glad I do n't , for , if I did , I know Tim would n't want me to tell you . He would n't want me to tell anyone . He always said these things were settled best on the side . I think Red Kelly knows . If he does n't , I 'm sure he 'll find out . I 'm thinking last night 's work has turned Redp359Kelly into a killer . It wo n't be long before  --  before something else will happen . There 'll be a shooting . Or a stabbing . And maybe another woman widowed --  " Once more , Bee 's voice died down . Sally looked at her a little fearfully . But , Bee --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you . I mean  --  do n't you  --  do n't you think you  --  you ought to tell ? ' Tell what ?

You know what you just told mc . ' I did n't tell you anything . I never asked Tim a question . He always said in his business there was no place for a skirt . Just once  --  three years ago , when they held up a truck of Joe Tonetti 's , down near Michigan City , and the driver was killed  --  I wanted to know who did it , and Tim fairly turned on me .

But I always thought he  --  knew . He held his tongue , though . He always said , " When you 're once outside the law , you do best to keep outside it . " He was no stool pigeon .

I 've no right to be filling you up with horrors , Sally . ' Bee , dear  --  I came to help you . ' It does n't help to dwell on it , I suppose . Bee 's voice was dull again .

When she spoke once more , her eyes were fastened on the pink rug at her feet . It was the girl 's night out and I was in the kitchen turning out the light in the back entry , when I heard that machine gun go off . I 'd never heard one before . I thought it was a car back-firing . And then  --  I knew it was n't . I knew it was n't before I heard Mrs. Swanson scream . I ran down the hall and out the front door , and I did n't see Tim , at first . I did n't see anything . It was dark , of course . The street was empty . But Mrs. Swanson was screaming on her path next door . And then I saw Lilian break away from her and come up to the hedge , and some men come running into the light of the street-lamp down the blockrunning like something had happened  --  into the light and out of it . I could hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming . And then  --  I saw Tim . I saw him lying on the front steps  --  just dropped there  --  twistedlike a rag doll .

They told me what they had seen . There was murder in my heart then , Sally . I could have killed them with my naked hands ! I could have handed them over to the first cop on the beat . But what was the use ? The car was gone . Before the police came , even , I was thinking what would Tim want me to say . And I knew it was nothing . ' Bee 's voice shook , finally , into silence .

And Red Kelly came , just as soon as he could , after the police were through questioning him . I guess he wanted to shut my mouth.  |p361He  found it shut , all right . He was here all night . It was midnightwhen we telephoned Tim 's family . They came right down from Waukegan in his brother-in-law 's car . His father and his two brothers and his married sister and the brother-in-law and poor little Queenie . She 's the one that 's a dancer , Sally , and she certainly loved Tim . Poor kid  --  the Orpheum Circuit called her up on the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sign a contract to dance in vaudeville for a month . They wanted to advertise her as the slain gunman'ssister . It 's terrible , is n't it , what people will think of to do ? This publicity 's going to be hard on Michael when he goes back to Princeton . He was doing well there and making nice friends . He plays on one of their ball teams . And he asked Tim last summer did he mind that he 'd kept it dark where his money came from ? Tim did n't blame him . He thought the world of Mike . But those reporters got his name last night . Red Kelly gave it on purpose , I think . He was kind of mad at Michael . He thought he did n't appreciate all Tim was doing for him . And then , Sally --  ' Bee stopped abruptly . Sherose from the sofa . She walked across the room in silence , her head held back and up , her elbows raised , her nervous hands rubbing the muscles at the back of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children . Whatever will I do with them ? ' Bee 's back was turned to Sally and her voice was desperate . She strained her head back wearily against her rubbing hands . I told them this morning , as gently as I could , that their father had died in the night . We hid all the papers and Mrs. Kelly 's been watching them like a hawk  --  but , of course , I 'll have to tell them . School opens next week and the first child they meet will give them an earful . Little Tim 's twelve and Gloria 's ten . They 'll take it terribly hard . The little boys , of course  --  but they 're not so little any more . They 'll wonder about it -- Oh , I do n't know , Sally ! All night , I lay thinking  --  how could I make them understand . Understand , I mean , how he ever got into it and how it had nothing to do with the kind of man he was . I tried to think back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing grew out of another . And , Sally0 --  " P362Bee stopped her restless pacing . Her hands dropped from her neck . She turned to confront Sally . Do you know what I realized ? I realized that it all came out of the War . ' The War ! ' cried Sally . Bee nodded solemnly . I know it seems far-fetched . But the War killed Tim , as if he 'd been killed in battle . If we 'd never fought it , Tim would be living now . He 'd be living in Waukegan , putting up buildingswith his father . He 'd never have come to Chicago at all . But we did fight it , and it made him restless and discontented . And it brought prohibition and that brought the liquor traffic . It 's all a piece of the same thing . If you want to reckon up the cost of war , you must count all the wrong it does , down the years  --  not just the poor boys who died in the service . There 's Sam , God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . But for one Sam , there 's thousands of others who are walking the streets of the world . Men , married and single , rich and poor , whose chances were ruined by trouble that was none of their making . Most of them do n't even know it . Tim never did . Tim thought his life was grand . He always said he 'd had fool 's luck . But , for all that , I 'm thinking your mother was right , Sally , when we all thought she was so queer . No good can come out of fighting . Look what came out of fighting , last night ! ' Bee 's eyes and voice were flaming with conviction . Oh , Bee ! ' cried Sally warmly . I agree with you ! Indeed , I do . I 've always been a pacifist . But you ca n't make people listen . You could n't even make Tim listen . I ca n't make Alan listen . Men like to fight  --  in battle and in bootlegging and in banks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Bee . The light had died in her eyes , the fire from her voice . And I do n't have to understand it , now . Life 's over for me . I 'll never have to cope with a man again . Except the children  --  there 's three of them that will grow into men , God willing . ' After a moment , Bee resumed her nervous pacing . I 've got to see them through , Sally , and I do n't know how to do it . I thought of that , too , last night . I kept thinking , what would Tim say ? What would Tim do ? For I 'll not keep it from you , Sally , that , these last months , Tim was worried aboutP363money . Of course it came in pretty regular , but his investments were troubling him . He 'd put by a lot , but  --  I do n't know much about it . I 'll have to learn about things I never troubled with before . ' Alan will help you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bank to see Mr. MacLeod . ' I 'd be grateful , ' said Bee simply . It seems queer to be talking like this about business  --  but the children 's future meant the world and all to Tim . My own loss , Sally  --  well , it wo n't bear talking of . Till you are one , Sally , you do n't know what it 's like to be left a widow ' She stopped , at the sound of a knockon the door . Come in . ' The pale , tear-stained face of Tim 's married sister appeared around the edge of the door . Bee , ' she said , the florist is here and he wants to talk to you about the pall . Father thinks we should have a cross worked into it in white roses . ' I ' 11 come , ' said Bee . The married sister withdrew . And I 'll go , ' said Sally . She rose to her feet . When you feel equal to it , you must come out to Lakewood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bee . Though Mother wants us . I feel I must get out of this . I 'd do well , I think , to change the children 's school . And then ' She paused on the threshold to lookback , wistfully , at the pink bedroom . I ca n't live here , in this room , without Tim . He picked it all out , you know , one day with me at Mandel 's . The whole thing was his own idea . The Du Barry suite , it was called , and Tim gave it to me for Christmas . ' Her arm around Sally , she walked slowly down the hall . At the top of the stairs , she stopped . Oh , Sally ! ' she cried , and her voice was breaking . It 's few women who have known the happiness that I have ! And the women who know happiness are the ones who know grief . ' The tears were streaming down Sally 's cheeks as she walked down the staircase . She could hear again the plaintive cadence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Kelly was still standing guard at the front door . He was talking to a white-haired priest . The door to the parlour was closed and beside it stood an enormous floral emblem of gates ajar  --  I red roses on white everlasting  --  on a gold easel . The florist must have just delivered it . Red Kelly put out his hand . He noticed Sally 's tears . The Holy Mother of God will bless you , Mrs. MacLeod , for what you 've done this day , ' he said solemnly . Sally looked up at him . Hearing those words and holding that hand , it was hard to think of him as a potential murderer . I want you to know his reverence , Father Delaney , ' he went on . The white-haired priest smiled down at her . The blue eyes , behind his gold-framed spectacles , were kindly , like Red Kelly 's . But his face was troubled . It might well be troubled , thought Sally . This was strange company for Father Delaney to keep . I 'm an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . I know , ' said Father Delaney . I know all about you . ' The blue eyes were so wise , so keen , and at the same time so indulgent , that Sally almost felt that he did . She experienced an absurd and fleeting desire to lay all her troubles at Father Delaney 's feet . Bee needs her friends , ' he added gently . And she 's got them , ' said Red Kelly grimly . There 's many who will not forget the work of last night . ' Easy , now , Kelly . Easy , ' said Father Delaney . Sally looked up at him gratefully . Red Kelly opened the door . I 'll see you tomorrow , wo n't I ? Eleven o'clock in the morningat the Holy Name Cathedral ? We 'll give him a fine funeral . ' Sally nodded , as she slipped through the door . The crowd was still on the sidewalk  --  slightly larger , if anything  --  the reporters were in the yard , the policeman was at the gate . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she emerged from the porch roof . A clean , scrubbed place on the front steps caught her attention , as it had not , when she entered . She stepped gravely around it . As she walked down the path , a reporter came up to her . I 'm Jim Devons , of the Tribune , Mrs. MacLeod , ' he said ingratiatingly . If your picture turns out good , I 'll mail you a copy . You might like it as a souvenir . ' Sally paused , for an instant , to look up at his pleasant , young face . The youth and the pleasure were both subtly disarming . Remonstrance , sheP365knew , would be useless . Something in her own face , however , seemed suddenly to disarm the reporter . He took off his hat . Or  --  maybe you would n't like it ? ' He questioned , uncertainly . Sally shook her head . I  --  I just wish you 'd  --  you 'd be kind to them , ' she stammeredinarticulately . Then , Thank you , officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populace received her moistly , with little shoves and eager stares of interest . The gate closed behind her with an abrupt click . As it did so , Sally was surprised to find herself breathing a little sigh of relief . Her heart ached for Bee  --  but she was on the right side of the law again . Bee 's point of view  --  Red Kelly 's veiled threat  --  it was all a little like a nightmare . Why had Tim done it ? Why had he kept on doing it ? But Bee had said  --  one thing led to another . Tim , the bootlegger , lyingdead today , while his henchmen planned him a fine funeral at the Holy Name Cathedral , was still the Tim of Mrs. Higgins 's boarding-house . And Bee was right . It was a long road , with many twistings and turnings  --  but it led back to the War . Sally sat quietly in a crowded pew in the Holy Name Cathedral , her eyes on the distant altar , listening to the triumphantstrains of the organ and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bronze casket under the cross of white roses at the steps of the chancel was Tim . The requiem mass was drawing to its close . Sally had been sitting in the crowded pew for nearly an hour . She had arrived at the cathedral long before the service began . She had stood on the west steps for some time being grateful for the weather  --  for the heat wave had broken and a strong east breeze had rushed in from the lake to sweep the city clean and fill the blue September sky with lying clouds like white banners , like floating domes of alabaster , for Tim 's funeral  --  and had watched the curious crowd collect around the portals of the church . It was held back by the police to a respectful distance on the sidewalk and cleared out of the street beyond , so that the State Street trolley cars could move . The curb was congested with funeral motors
