In London last week was staged what was tantamount to a preview of the Olympic Games to be held in Helsinki next summer . At White City Stadium 95 hand-picked track &; field stars representing 16 nations competed in the British A. A. A. 's annual international track meet . Before 60,000 onlookers , the U. S. team of ten won eight of the 14 events , broke two British records ( 440-yd. hurdles and shot put ) , piled up 54 points-13 more than Great Britain , 29 more than Germany , 38 more than Italy . <P> In the 1936 Olympics , the No. 1 hero was Negro Jesse Owens of Cleveland , winner of the 100-meter dash , 200-meter dash and broad jump . Last week it appeared that the 1940 Olympic hero would be another midwestern U. S. Negro , 190-lb . William Delouis Watson , University of Michigan senior . In last week 's meet at White City , rangy Bill Watson scored 13 of the 54 U. S. points : first in the shot put ( with a record-breaking heave of 52 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 24 ft. 6 in. ) and third in the discus . <P> Son of a Saginaw , Mich. dressmaker , Bill Watson-who is earning his way through college by waiting on table and acting as secretary to Prize Fighter Joe Louis-is considered the best all-round track man in the U. S. Besides winning the Big Ten championship in the shot put , broad jump and discus three years in a row , he has cleared the high jump at 6 ft. 5 in. , has run 100 yd. in 10.1 sec. , 440 yd. in 55 sec . If he can brush up on the pole vault , javelin , high hurdles and the 1,500-meter run , he may be America 's best bet for the 1940 Decathlon championship .
