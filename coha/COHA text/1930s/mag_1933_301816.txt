Like many another Democrat , Alfred Emanuel Smith has a low opinion of the R. F. C. as a Depression-buster . Before a Catholic Conference on Industrial Problems in Manhattan last week he flayed its tight-fisted method of doling out small sums at high interest rates . <P> Cried Citizen Smith : " In the World War we took our Constitution , wrapped it up and laid it on the shelf until it was over . ... If we 're going to get anywhere in this business of getting out of the Depression-of using public funds to stimulate business , we 've got to appoint a Director General of Public Works to wipe out these laws and put the buildings up . " <P> Next day Al Smith carried his complaints against R. F. C. policy to Washington and straight into the R. F. C. board room itself . There he appeared as spokesman for the New York State Emergency Public Works Commission which was trying to borrow $93.000.000 from the R. F. C. for job-making construction . <P> Democrat Smith , wearing a black derby and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York train before newshawks fluttered excitedly about him . plied him with questions . <P> Could he favor the Press with his view 's on business conditions ? <P> " I can and briefly-there is no evidence of improvement . " <P> Could he foresee improvement ? <P> " Nope . I 'm no prophet . " <P> When Spokesman Smith marched in before the seven R. F. C. directors , out in the corridor gathered dozens of chattering clerks , stenographers , typists and underlings , to glimpse the " Happy Warrior . " In the door they found a peek-hole through which they watched him pound the board table , wave his cigar , shake his greying head . Cried Al Smith angrily : " The R.F.C. can act like a suspicious banker with two glass eyes or it can take up its social responsibilities and put men to work . " <P> During a lull in the hearings Spokesman Smith suddenly opened the glass door to get a drink outside and the crowd of female clerks at the threshold fell headlong into his arms and the board room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl after girl by the hand . Girls flocked in from all over the building . Annoyed at the delay , pompous R. F. C. Chairman Pomerene finally banged for order . <P> Two pretty clerks were on the tag-end of the line . Waving Chairman Pomerene aside , Al Smith declared : " Just a minute , gentlemen , just a minute . Here are two lovely girls still in the doorway . One of these might be the one who signs the checks . Come on in , ladies . I want to shake your lovely hands . How do you do ! How do you do ? " <P> As Spokesman Smith returned to the job of extracting cash for New York tunnels , bridges and causeways , the R. F. C. corridor crackled with excited feminine comment : " Simply grand ! What a man ! A honey ! A peach ! And was n't that little green bow tie cute ! "
