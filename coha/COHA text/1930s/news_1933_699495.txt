txt Adolf Hitler , speaking at a huge National Socialist mass meeting in the Sportpalast tonight in his first public appearance since his appointment as Chancellor , declared war on the " parliamentary-democratic system . " " The parties of class warfare may be sure that so long as the Almighty lets me live my determination . to destroy them will be unconquerable ! " he exclaimed . " There is to be either the German nation or Marxism ! " We want a break with what a rotten brand of democracy has produced and realize that all that is great can be created only by the strength of individual personality and that all that is to be preserved must be entrusted agaiq to ability and individual personality , while the parliamentary-democratic system must be fought . " Four weeks ago Herr Hitler . the hated , slandered and ridiculed leader of the opposition , left the huge hall of the Sportpalast after having pleaded with his followers not to relax in the fight for power although the defeat and disintegration of his party seemed imminent . Returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by thousands of Nazis as the leader who innumerable times had bidden them be patient and who had finally kept his promise to achieve power . It was undoubtedly one of the supreme moments of his career when he marched into the Sportpalest accompanied by a large group of uniformed Nazis . This time there were no restrictions and no police to dissolve the meeting ; he came as the master , and the first rows of boxes were filled with the members of the diplomatic corps . The meeting was not a political event but was rather in the nature of a party celebration . The Chan-1 cellor 's speech accordingly was pro-1 grammatic only in the wider sense of the word . He reviewed the fourtern years of Gerifian history since the World War , told how he had decided to found the fNational Socialist movement to fight Marxism and the doctrine of class warfare and outlined the principles that guided him and his Cabinet . In 1918 , he declared , the German revolution split the people into parties and classes , just as sixty years earlier Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that there was only one way out of this situation , namely , the way to the reconstruction of a new German unity . " Then a " Simple Soldier . " " I was then a simple unknown soldier who decided to found a movement that would be able to reunite the German people on the new way beyond all professions of classes and parties , " he asserted . " This primarily necessitated a fight against class warfare and a fight against Marxism . " Chancellor Hitler then went into a long review of the post-war period , " that era when everything that the German people had attained in previous years was renounced ; when German business lost all its foreign investments ; when the peace treaty obligations imposed upon the German people , which were sheer madness especially because they were based upon the outcome of the war , attempted to divide the world into two parts : victorious and vanquished peoples , the first with rights . the others without rights . " All this , Herr Hitler declared , had been done and caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to those of them who asked him what his program was he would reply : " After your regime and because of your Constitution it is necessary to rebuild the bases of the German nation just as you destroyed those bases . " The Chancellor then enumerated the main points of his " program . " Explaining the first , he said : " We wo n't lie and I have always declined to make cheap promises . Just as I have worked fourteen years building up this movement , so I am determined to work for the recovery of the German nation . " Urges Self-Reliance . The second point , he declared , was that the German people " must cooperate and must not expect life , liberty and happiness as gifts from heaven , nor wait for help from abroad but rely solely on itself , and the people and soil must therefore be the roots out of which the new force must be derived . " " For fourteen years the parties of destruction , of revolution , have led and mistreated the German people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today I stand before the German nation pleading , ' Give us four years ' time and then pass your judgment . ' " To take office was the hardest decision of my life . I dared to do it because I am convinced that , although many are not giving us our due and millions are cursing us the hour will come when the German people will march behind us and realize : ' He wanted only our well-being . ' " Herr Hitler- concluded with a dramatic recital of his . political faith . " I can not escape the conviction that our nation will arise again , " he declared . " I can not alienate myself from my love for its people . For this is my belief : There will arise a new German Reich , great in honor , power , glory and righteousness . " Huge loud-speakers had been installed on ten Berlin squares , and large crowds listened to the Chancellor 's speech , which was frequently interrupted by prolonged cheers . It was broadcast over a nation-wide hook-up .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
