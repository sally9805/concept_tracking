In Europe it was once common to convert whole peoples , by main force , from one Christian faith to another , on the historic principle of Cuius regio , eius religio ( " whose rule , his religion " ) . Long in disuse , this principle was last week once again being honored in eastern Europe . The rule was Poland 's , the religion , Roman Catholicism . Or so it was loudly and plausibly charged by those who were undergoing the " conversion " - 7,000,000 Ukrainians in southeastern Poland . <P> Poland has some 24,000,000 Roman Catholics , nearly 75% of its population . Like most east-European nations , it has also an autonomous Orthodox Church and a Greek Catholic or " Uniat " Church , in communion with Rome but using its own form of Mass . Poland 's Ukrainians are about equally divided between the Orthodox and Uniat Churches , which have been so friendly that the Uniat Primate is also a leader of the Orthodox faithful . The Primate , Count Andrey Sheptytsky , Arch bishop of Lwow , is almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that he can not preach . Instead he makes phono graph records of his pronouncements , ships them throughout the Ukraine . <P> Trying to make themselves heard above other clamorous minorities last week ( see p. 21 ) , Polish Ukrainians complained that their Orthodox churches , some of them extremely ancient , were being systematically pulled down or turned into Roman Catholic churches . Of 350 which existed in 1918 , all but 50 have vanished or changed hands , most of them during the past year . Both Orthodox and Uniat faithful , the Ukrainians declared , have been forced to adopt Roman Catholicism . <P> Neither the Vatican nor Archbishop Sheptytsky has pretended to be grateful for this exercise of Cuius regio . They well know that the Polish Government wishes to crush Ukrainian nationalist tendencies , centred in the churches , and also to stir up religious bitterness among the Ukrainians . In the latter aim it has succeeded . In a pastoral , suppressed by the Government but circulated ( in English ) in London and Manhattan last week , Archbishop Sheptytsky admitted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what has transpired on the Apostolic See ... A new abyss is being opened between the Eastern and the Catholic Churches . "
