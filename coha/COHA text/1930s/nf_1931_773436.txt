txt // In 1554 Charles had obtained a bull from Pope Julius III granting him a dispensation from fasting , and allowing him to break his fast early in the morning even when he was to take the sacrament . " That Charles was not altogether unmindful of his wearing apparel in Yuste may be inferred from the fact that his wardrobe contained no fewer than sixteen robes of silk and velvet , lined with ermine , or eider down , or soft hair of the Barbary goat . As to the furniture and upholstery of his apartments , how little reliance is to be placed on the reports so carelessly circulated about these may be gathered from a single glance at the inventory of his effects , prepared by Quixada and Gaztelu soon after their master 's death . Among the items we find carpets from Turkey and Alcarez , canopies of velvet and other stuffs , hangings of fine black cloth , which since his mother 's death he had always chosen for his own bedroom ; while the remaining apartments were provided with no fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flanders , richly embroidered with figures of animals and with landscapes . . . . " Among the different pieces of plate we find some of pure gold , and others especially noted for their curious workmanship ; and as this was an age in which the art of working the precious metals was carried to the highest perfection , we can not doubt that some of the finest specimens had come into the Emperor 's possession . The whole amount of plate was estimated at between twelve and thirteen thousand ounces in weight . " ... 1 Charles had never acquired the habit of reading , but he would be read aloud to at meals after ' the fashion of Charlemagne , and would make what one narrator describes as a " sweet and heavenly commentary . " He also amused himself with technical toys , by listening to music or sermons , and by attending to the imperial business that still came drifting in to him . The death of the Empress , to whom he was greatly attached , had turned his mind towards religion , which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday in Lent he scourged himself with the rest of the monks with such good will as to draw blood . These exercises and the gout released a bigotry in Charles that had been hitherto restrained by considerations of policy . The appearance of Protestant teaching close at hand in Valladolid // roused him to fury . " Tell the grand inquisitor and his council from me to be at their posts , and to lay the axe at the root of the evil before it spreads further . " . . . He expressed a doubt whether it would not be well , in so black an affair , to dispense with the ordinary course of justice , and to show no mercy , " lest the criminal , if pardoned , should have the opportunity of repeating his crime . " He recommended , as an example , his own mode of proceeding in the Netherlands , " where all who remained obstinate in their errors were burned alive , and those who were admitted to penitence were beheaded . " And almost symbolical of Charles 's place and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as if he felt the need to write Finis to something exhausted . He not only attended every actual funeral that was celebrated at Yuste , but he had services conducted for the absent dead , he held a funeral service in memory of his wife on the anniversary of her death , and , finally , he celebrated his own obsequies . " The chapel was hung with black , and the blaze of hundreds of wax lights was scarcely sufficient to dispel the darkness . The brethren in their conventual dress , and all the Emperor 's household clad in deep mourning , gathered round a huge catafalque , shrouded also in black , which had been raised in the centre of the chapel . The service for the burial of the dead was then performed ; and , amidst the dismal wail of the monks , the prayers ascended for the departed spirit , that it might be received into the mansions of the blessed . The sorrowful attendants were melted to tears as the image of their master 's death was presented to their minds ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compassion by this pitiable display of weakness . Charles , muffled in a dark mantle , and bearing a lighted candle in his hand , mingled with his household , the spectator of his own obsequies ; and the doleful ceremony was concluded by his placing the taper in the hands of the priest , in sign of his surrendering up his soul to the Almighty . " Other accounts make Charles wear a shroud and lie in the coffin , remaining there alone until the last mourner had left the chapel . Within two months of this masquerade he was dead . And the greatness of the Holy Roman Empire died with him . The Holy Roman Empire struggled on , indeed , to the days of Napoleon , but as an invalid and dying thing . To this day its unburied tradition poisons our political air . // ? 13n Ferdinand , the brother of Charles V , took over his abandoned search for unity and met the German princes at Augsburg in 1555 . Again there was an attempt to establish a religious peace . Nothing could better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blindness of the princes and statesmen concerned in it to the deeper and broader processes of the time , than the form that settlement took . The recognition of religious freedom was to apply to the states and not to individual citizens ; cujus regio ejus religio , " the confession of the subject was to be dependent on that of the territorial lord . " ? 13c We have given as much attention as we have done to the writings of Machiavelli and to the personality of Charles V because they throw a flood of light upon the antagonisms of the next period in our history . This present chapter has told the story of a vast expansion of human horizons and of a great increase and distribution of knowledge ; we have seen the conscience of common men awakening and intimations of a new and profounder social justice spreading throughout the general body of the Western civilization . But this process of light and thought was leaving Courts and the political life of the world untouched . There is little in Machiavelli that might not have been written by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shi-Hwang-ti ? or even of Sargon I or Pepi . While the world in everything else was moving forward , in political ideas , in ideas about the relationship of state to state and of sovereign to citizen , it was standing still . Nay , it was falling back . For the great idea of the Catholic Church as the world city of God had been destroyed in men 's minds by the church itself , and the dream of a world imperialism had , in the person of Charles V , been carried in effigy through Europe to limbo . Politically the world seemed falling back towards personal monarchy of the Assyrian or Macedonian pattern . It is not that the newly-awakened intellectual energies of Western European men were too absorbed in theological restatement , in scientific investigations , in exploration and mercantile development , to give a thought to the claims and responsibilities of rulers . Not only were common men drawing ideas of a theocratic or republican or communistic character from the now accessible Bible , but the renewed study of the Greek classics was bringing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western mind . In England Sir Thomas More produced a quaint imitation of Plato 's Republic in his Utopia , setting out a sort of autocratic communism . In Naples , a century later , a certain friar Campanella was equally bold in his City of the Sun . But such discussions were having no immediate effect upon political arrangements . Compared with the massiveness of the task , these books do , indeed , seem poetical and scholarly and flimsy . ( Yet later on the Utopia was to bear fruit in the English Poor Laws . ) The intellectual and moral development of the Western mind and this drift towards Machiavellian monarchy in Europe were for a time going on concurrently in the same world , but they were going on almost independently . The statesmen still schemed and manoeuvred as if nothing grew but the power of wary and fortunate kings . It was only in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that these two streams of tendency ? the stream of general ideas and the drift of traditional and egoistic monarchical diplomacy ? interfered and came into conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PRINCES , PARLIAMENTS AND POWERS ? 1 .

It is still a vast unformed thing , still only in the opening phases of growth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holy Roman Empire and of the Roman Church , as forms of universal law and order , fade in its dawn . They fade out , as if it were necessary in order that these ideas of one law and one order for all men should be redrawn on world-wide lines . And while in nearly every other field of human interest there was advance , the effacement of these general political ideas of the Church and Empire led back for a time in things political towards merely personal monarchy and monarchist nationalism of the Macedonian type . There came an interregnum , as it were , in the consolidation of human affairs , a phase of the type the Chinese annalists would 804 // call an " Age of Confusion . " This interregnum has lasted as long as that between the fall of the Western Empire and the crowning of Charlemagne in Rome . We are living in it to-day . It may be drawing to its close ; we can not tell yet . The old leading ideas had broken down , a medley of new and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and meanwhile the world at large had to fall back for leadership upon the ancient tradition of an individual prince . There was no new way clearly apparent for men to follow , and the prince was there . All over the world the close of the sixteenth century saw monarchy prevailing and tending towards absolutism . Germany and Italy were patchworks of autocratic princely dominions , Spain was practically autocratic , the throne had never been so powerful in England , and , as the seventeenth century drew on the French monarchy gradually became the greatest and most consolidated power in Europe . The phases and fluctuations of its ascent we can not record here . At every Court there were groups of ministers and secretaries who played a Machiavellian game against their foreign rivals . Foreign policy is the natural employment of courts and monarchies . Foreign offices are , so to speak , the leading characters in all the histories of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . They kept Europe in a fever of wars . And wars were becoming expensive . Armies were no longer untrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own horses and weapons and retainers with them ; they needed more and more artillery ; they consisted of paid troops who insisted on their pay ; they were professional and slow and elaborate , conducting long sieges , necessitating elaborate fortifications . War expenditure increased everywhere and called for more and more taxation . And here it was that these monarchies of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries came into conflict with new and shapeless forces of freedom in the community . In practice the princes found they were not masters of their subjects ' lives or property . They found an inconvenient resistance to the taxation that was necessary if their diplomatic aggressions and alliances were to continue . Finance became an unpleasant spectre in every council chamber . In theory the monarch owned his country . James I of England ( 1603 ) declared that " As it is atheism and blasphemy to dispute what God can do ; so it is presumption and high contempt in a subject to dispute what a king can do , or say that a king can not do this or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his son Charles I ( 1625 ) was to find still more effectually , that there were in his dominions a great number of landlords and merchants , substantial and intelligent persons , who set a very definite limit to the calls and occasions of the monarch and his ministers . They were prepared to tolerate his rule if they themselves might also be monarchs of their lands and businesses and trades and what not . But not otherwise . Everywhere in Europe there was a parallel development . Beneath the kings and princes there were these lesser monarchs , the private owners , noblemen , wealthy citizens and the like , who were now offering the sovereign prince much the same resistance that the kings and princes of Germany had offered the emperor . They wanted to limit taxation so far as it pressed upon themselves , and to be free in their own houses and estates . And the spread of books and reading and intercommunication was enabling these smaller monarchs , these monarchs of ownership , to develop such a community of ideas and such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage in the world 's history . Everywhere they were disposed to resist the prince , but it was not everywhere that they found the same facilities for an organized resistance . The economic circumstances and the political traditions of the Netherlands and England made those countries the first to bring this antagonism of monarchy and private ownership to an issue . At first this seventeenth-century " public , " this public of property owners , cared very little for foreign policy . They did not perceive at first how it affected them . They did not want to be bothered with it ; it was , they conceded , the affairs of kings and princes . They made no attempt , therefore , to control foreign entanglements . But it was with the direct consequences of these entanglements that they quarrelled ; they objected to heavy taxation , to interference with trade , to arbitrary imprisonment , and to the control of consciences by the monarch . It was upon these questions that they joined issue with the Crown . ? 2 The breaking away of the Netherlands from absolutist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries . They varied very greatly in detail according to local and racial peculiarities , but essentially // they were all rebellious against the idea of a predominating personal " prince " and his religious and political direction . In the twelfth century all the lower Rhine country was divided up among a number of small rulers , and the population was a Low German one on a Celtic basis , mixed with subsequent Danish ingredients very similar to the English admixture . The southeastern fringe of it spoke French dialects ; the bulk , Frisian , Dutch and other Low German languages . The Netherlands figured largely in the crusades . Godfrey of Bouillon , who took Jerusalem ( First Crusade ) , was a Belgian ; and the founder of the so-called Latin Dynasty of emperors in Constantinople ( Fourth Crusade ) was Baldwin of Flanders . ( They were called Latin emperors because they were on the side of the Latin Church . ) In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries considerable towns grew up in the Netherlands : Ghent , Bruges , Ypres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and these towns developed quasiindependent municipal governments and a class of educated townsmen . We will not trouble the reader with the dynastic accidents that linked the affairs of the Netherlands with Burgundy ( Eastern France ) , and which finally made their overlordship the inheritance of the Emperor Charles V. It was under Charles that the Protestant doctrines that now prevailed in Germany spread into the Netherlands . Charles persecuted with some vigour , but in 1556 , as we have told , he handed over the task to his son Philip ( Philip II ) . Philip 's spirited foreign policy ? he was carrying on a war with France ? presently became a second source of trouble between himself and the Netherlandish noblemen and townsmen , because he had to come to them for supplies . The great nobles , led by William the Silent , Prince of Orange , and the Counts of Egmont and Horn , made themselves the heads of a popular resistance , in which it is now impossible to disentangle the objection to taxation from the objection to religious persecution . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestants as the struggle grew in bitterness . The people were already bitterly Protestant . Philip was resolved to rule both the property and consciences of his Netherlanders . He sent picked Spanish troops into the country , and he made governor-general a nobleman named Alva , one of those ruthless " strong " men who wreck governments and monarchies . For a time he ruled the land with a hand of iron , but the hand of iron begets a soul of iron in the body it grips , and in 1567 the Netherlands were in open revolt . Alva // murdered , sacked , and massacred ? in vain . Counts Egmont and Horn were executed . William the Silent became the great leader of the Dutch , a king de facto . For a long time , and with many complications , the struggle for liberty continued , and through it all it is noteworthy that the rebels continued to cling to the plea that Philip II was their king ? if only he would be a reasonable and limited king . But the idea of limited monarchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and at last Philip drove the United Provinces , for which we now use the name of Holland , to the republican form of government . Holland , be it noted ? not all the Netherlands ; the southern Netherlands , Belgium as we now call that country , remained at the end of the struggle a Spanish possession and Catholic . The siege of Alkmaar ( 1573 ) , as Motley ' . describes it , may be taken as a sample of that long and hideous conflict between the little Dutch people and the still vast resources of Catholic Imperialism . If I take Alkmaar , ' Alva wrote to Philip , I am resolved not to leave a single creature alive ; the knife shall be put to every throat . ' . . . " And now , with the dismantled and desolate Haarlem before their eyes , a prophetic phantom , perhaps , of their own imminent fate , did the handful of people shut up within Alkmaar prepare for the worst . Their main hope lay in the friendly sea . The vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole northern province could be very soon effected , were but a few miles distant . By opening these gates and by piercing a few dykes the ocean might be made to fight for them . To obtain this result , however , the consent of the inhabitants was requisite , as the destruction of all the standing crops would be inevitable . The city was so closely invested that it was difficult therefore , to find an envoy for this hazardous mission . At last , a carpenter in the city , Peter Van der Mey by name , undertook the adventure . . . . " Affairs soon approached a crisis within the beleaguered , city . Daily skirmishes , without decisive results , had taken place outside the walls . At last , on the 18th of September , after a steady cannonade of nearly twelve hours , Don Frederick , at three in the afternoon , ordered an assault . Notwithstanding his seven months ' // experience at Haarlem , he still believed it certain that he should carry Alkmaar by storm . The attack took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red tower on the opposite side . Two choice regiments , recently arrived from Lombardy , led the onset , rending the air with their shouts and confident of an easy victory . They were sustained by what seemed an overwhelming force of disciplined troops . Yet never , even in the recent history of Haarlem , had an attack been received by more dauntless breasts . Every living man was on the walls . The storming parties were assailed with cannon , with musketry , with pistols . Boiling water , pitch and oil , molten lead , and unslaked lime were poured upon them every moment . Hundreds of tarred and burning hoops were skilfully quoited around the necks of the soldiers , who struggled in vain to extricate themselves from these fiery ruffs , while as fast as any of the invaders planted foot upon the breach they were confronted face to face with sword and dagger by the burghers , who hurled them headlong into the moat below . " Thrice was the attack renewed with ever-increasing rage ? thrice repulsed with unflinching fortitude . The storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the defenders left his post , till he dropped from it dead or wounded . . . . The trumpet of recall was sounded , and the Spaniards , utterly discomfited , retired from the walls , leaving at least one thousand dead in the trenches , while only thirteen burghers and twenty-four of the garrison lost their lives . . . . Ensign Solis , who had mounted the breach for an instant , and miraculously escaped with life after having been hurled from the battlements , reported that he had seen neither helmet nor harness ' as he looked down into the city : only some plain-looking people generally dressed like fishermen . Yet these plain-looking fishermen had defeated the veterans of Alva . . . . " Meantime , as Governor Sonoy had opened many of the dykes , the land in the neighbourhood of the camp was becoming plashy , although as yet the threatened inundation had not taken place . The soldiers were already very uncomfortable and very refractory . The carpetner-envoy had not been idle . . . . " He returned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost these dispatches as he made his way into the town , so that they fell into Alva 's hands . They contained a definite promise from the Duke of Orange to flood the country so as to drown the whole Spanish army . Incidentally this would also have drowned most of the Dutch harvest and cattle . But // Alva , when he had read these documents , did not wait for the opening of any more sluices . Presently the stout men of Alkmaar , cheering and jeering , watched the Spaniards breaking camp . . . . The form assumed by the government of liberated Holland was a patrician republic under the leadership of the House of Orange . The States-General was far less representative of the whole body of citizens than was the English Parliament , whose struggle with the Crown we shall next relate . Though the worst of the struggle was over after Alkmaar , Holland was not effectively independent until 1609 , and its independence was only fully and completely recognized by the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. ? 3 The open struggle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince " begins in England far back in the twelfth century . The phase in this struggle that we have to study now is the phase that opened with the attempts of Henry VII and VIII , and their successors , Edward VI , Mary , and Elizabeth to make the government of England a " personal monarchy " of the continental type . It became more acute when , by dynastic accidents , James , King of Scotland , became James I , King of both Scotland and England ( 1603 ) , and began to talk in the manner we have already quoted of his " divine right " to do as he pleased But never had the path of English monarchy been a smooth one . In all the monarchies of the Northern and Germanic invaders of the empire there had been a tradition of a popular assembly of influential and representative men to preserve their general liberties , and in none was it more living than in England . France had her tradition of the assembly of the Three Estates , Spain her Cortes , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had behind it a documentary declaration of certain elementary and universal rights , and that it contained elected " Knights of the Shire " as well as elected burghers from the towns . The French and Spanish assemblies had the latter but not the former elected element . These two features gave the English Parliament a peculiar strength in its struggle with the Throne . The document in question was Magna Charta , the Great Charter , a declaration which was forced from King John ( 1199-1216 ) , the brother and successor of Richard Coeur de Lion ( 1189-99 ) , after a revolt of the Barons // in 1215 . It rehearsed a number of fundamental rights that made England a legal and not a regal state . It rejected the power of the king to control the personal property and liberty of every sort of citizen ? save with the consent of that man 's equals . The presence of the elected shire representatives in the English Parliament ? the second peculiarity of the British situation ? came about from very simple and apparently innocuous beginnings . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been summoned to the national council to testify to the taxable capacity of their districts . They were sent up by the minor gentry , freeholders and village elders of their districts as early as 1254 , two knights from each shire . This idea inspired Simon de Montfort , who was in rebellion against Henry III , the successor of John , to summon to the national council two knights from each shire // and two citizens from each city or borough . Edward I , the successor to Henry III , continued , this practice because it seemed a convenient way of getting into financial touch with the growing towns . At first there was considerable reluctance on the parts of the knights and townsmen to attend Parliament , but gradually the power they possessed of linking the redress of grievances with the granting of subsidies was realized . Quite early , if not from the first , these representatives of the general property owners in town and country , the Commons , sat and debated apart from the great Lords and Bishops . So there grew up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an episcopal and patrician one , the Lords . There was no profound and fundamental difference between the personnel of the two assemblies ; many of the knights of the shire were substantial men who might be as wealthy and influential as peers and also the sons and brothers of peers , but on the whole the Commons was the more plebeian assembly . From the first these two assemblies , and especially the Commons , displayed a disposition to claim the entire power of taxation in the land . Gradually they extended their purview of grievances to a criticism of all the affairs of the realm . We will not follow the fluctuations of the power and prestige of the English Parliament through the time of the Tudor monarchs ( i.e. , Henry VII and VIII , Edward VI , Mary , and Elizabeth ) , but it will be manifest from what has been said that when at last James Stuart made his open claim to autocracy , the English merchants , peers , and private gentlemen found themselves with a tried and honoured traditional means of resisting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiarity of the English political conflict was its comparative detachment from the great struggle between Catholic and Protestant that was now being waged all over Europe . There were , it is true , very distinct religious issues mixed up in the English struggle , but upon its main lines it was a political struggle of King against the Parliament embodying the class of privateproperty-owning citizens . But Crown and people were formally reformed and Protestant . It is true that many people on the latter side were Protestants of a Bible-respecting , non-sacerdotal type , representing the Reformation according to the peoples , and that the king was the nominal head of a special sacerdotal and sacramental church , the established Church of England , representPRINCES , // ing the Reformation according to the princes , but this antagonism never completely obscured the essentials of the conflict . The struggle of King and Parliament had already reached an acute phase before the death of James I ( 1625 ) , but only in the reign of his son Charles I did it culminate in civil war . Charles did exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a position , in view of the lack of Parliamentary control over foreign policy ; he embroiled the country in a conflict with both Spain and France , and then came to the country for supplies in the hope that patriotic feeling would override the normal dislike to giving him money . When Parliament refused supplies , he demanded loans from various subjects , and attempted similar illegal exactions . This produced from Parliament in 1628 a very memorable document , the Petition of Right ; citing the Great Charter and rehearsing the legal , limitations upon the power of the English king , denying his right to levy charges upon , or to imprison or punish anyone , or to quarter soldiers on the people , without due process of law . The Petition of Right stated the case of the English Parliament . The disposition to " state a case " has always been a very marked English characteristic . When President Wilson , during the Great War of 1914=18 , prefaced each step in his policy by a " Note , " he was walking in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Parliament with a high hand ; he dismissed it in 1629 , and for eleven years he summoned no Parliament . He levied money illegally , but not enough for his purpose ; and realizing that the church could be used as an instrument of obedience , he made Laud , an aggressive high churchman , very much of a priest and a very strong believer in " divine right , " Archbishop of Canterbury , and so head of the Church of England . In 1638 Charles tried to extend the half-Protestant , halfCatholic characteristics of the Church of England to his other kingdom of Scotland , where the secession from Catholicism had been more complete , and where a non-sacerdotal , non-sacramental form of Christianity , Presbyterianism had been established as the national church . The Scotch revolted , and the English levies Charles raised to fight them mutinied . Insolvency , at all times the natural result of a " spirited " foreign policy , was close at hand . Charles , without money or trustworthy // troops , had to summon a Parliament at last in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissed in the same year ; tie tried a Council of Peers at York ( 1640 ) , and then , in the November of that year , summoned his last Parliament . This body , the Long Parliament , assembled in the mood for conflict . It seized Laud , the Archbishop of Canterbury , and charged him with treason . It published a " Grand Remonstrance , " which was a long and full statement of its case against Charles . It provided by a Bill for a meeting of Parliament at least once in three years , whether the King summoned it or no . It prosecuted the King 's chief ministers who had helped him to reign for so long without Parliament , and in particular the Earl of Strafford . To save Strafford the King plotted for a sudden seizure of London by the army . This was discovered , and the Bill for Strafford 's condemnation was hurried on in the midst of a vast popular excitement . Charles I , who was probably one of the meanest and most treacherous occupants the English throne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before Strafford could die by due legal process , it was necessary for the King to give his assent . Charles gave it ? and Strafford was beheaded . Meanwhile the King was plotting and looking for help in strange quarters ? from the Catholic Irish , from treasonable Scotchmen . Finally , he resorted to a forcible-feeble display of violence . He went down to the Houses of Parliament to arrest five of his most active opponents . He entered the House of Commons and took the Speaker 's chair . He was prepared with some bold speech , about treason , but when he saw the places of his five antagonists vacant , he was baffled , confused , and spoke in broken sentences . He learnt that they had departed from his royal city of Westminster and taken refuge in the city of London , which had municipal autonomy . London defied him . A week later the Five Members were escorted back in triumph to the Parliament House in Westminster by the Trained Bands of London , and the King , to avoid the noise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both parties then prepared openly for war . The King was the traditional head of the army , and the habit of obedience in soldiers is to the King . The Parliament had the greater resources . The King set up his standard at Nottingham on the eve of a dark and stormy August day in 1642 . There followed a long and obstinate civil war , the King holding Oxford , the Parliament , London . Success swayed from side to side , but the King could never close on London nor Parliament // take Oxford . Each antagonist was weakened by moderate adherents who " did not want to go too far . " There emerged among the Parliamentary commanders a certain Oliver Cromwell , who had raised a small troop of horse and who rose to the position of general . Lord Warwick , his contemporary , describes him as a plain man , in a cloth suit " made by an ill country tailor . " He was no mere fighting soldier , but a military organizer ; he realized the inferior quality of many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Cavaliers of the King had the picturesque tradition of chivalry and loyalty on their side ; Parliament was something new and difficult ? without any comparable traditions .

" Do you think that the spirits of such base and mean fellows will ever be able to encounter gentlemen that have honour and courage and resolution in them ? " ' But there is something better and stronger than picturesque chivalry in the world , religious enthusiasm . So Cromwell set himself to get together a " godly " regiment . They were to be earnest , sober-living men . Above all , they were to be men of strong convictions . He disregarded all social traditions and drew his officers from every class . " I had rather have a plain , russet-coated captain that knows what he fights for and loves what he knows , than what you call a gentleman and is nothing else . " England discovered a new force , the Ironsides , in its midst , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high command , side by side with men of family . They became the type on which the Parliament sought to reconstruct its entire army . The Ironsides were the backbone of the " New Model . " From Marston Moor to Naseby these men swept the Cavaliers before them . The King was at last a captive in the hands of Parliament . There were still attempts at settlement that would have left the King a sort of king , but Charles was a man doomed to tragic issues , incessantly scheming , " so false a man that he is not to be trusted . " The English were drifting towards a situation new in the world 's history , in which a monarch should be formally tried for treason to his people and condemned . Most revolutions are precipitated , as this English one was , by the excesses of the ruler , and by attempts at strength and firmness beyond the compass of the law ; and most revolutions swing by a kind of necessity towards an extremer conclusion than is warranted by the original quarrel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are by nature a compromising and even a vacillating people , and probably the great majority of them still wanted the King to be King and the people to be free , and all the lions and lambs to lie down together in peace and liberty . But the army of the New Model could not go back . There would have been scant mercy for these draymen and footmen who had ridden down the King 's gentlemen if the King came back . When Parliament began to treat again with this regal trickster , the New Model intervened ; Colonel Pride turned out eighty members from the House of Commons who favoured the King , and the illegal residue , the Rump Parliament , then put the King on trial . But indeed the King was already doomed . The House of Lords rejected the ordinance for the trial , and the Rump then proclaimed " that the People are , under God , the original of all just power , " and that " the Commons of England . . . have the supreme power in this nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? proceeded with the trial . The King was condemned as a " tyrant , traitor , murderer , and enemy of his country . " He was taken one January morning in 1649 to a scaffold erected outside the windows of his own banqueting-room at Whitehall . There he was beheaded . He died with piety and a certain noble self-pity  --   --  eight years after the execution of Strafford , and after six and a half years of a destructive civil war which had been caused almost entirely by his own lawlessness . This was indeed a great and terrifying thing that Parliament had done . The like of it had never been heard of in the world before . Kings had killed each other times enough ; parricide , fratricide , assassination , those are the privileged expedients of princes ; but that a section of the people should rise up , try its king solemnly and deliberately for disloyalty , mischief , and treachery , and condemn and kill him , sent horror through every Court in Europe . The Rump Parliament had gone beyond the ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a committee of jungle deer had taken and killed a tiger ? a crime against nature . The Tsar of Russia chased the English Envoy from his Court . France and Holland committed acts of open hostility .

But for a time the personal quality of Oliver Cromwell and the discipline and strength of the army he had created maintained England in the republican course she had taken . The Irish Catholics had made a massacre of the Protestant English // in Ireland , and now Cromwell suppressed the Irish insurrection with great vigour . Except for certain friars at the storm of Drogheda , none but men with arms in their hands were killed by his troops ; but the atrocities of the massacre were fresh in his mind , no quarter was given in battle , and so his memory still rankles in the minds of the Irish , who have a long memory for their own wrongs .

The Dutch were then the rulers of the sea , and the English fleet fought against odds ; but after a series of obstinate sea fights the Dutch were driven from the British seas and the English took their place as the ascendant naval power . Dutch and French ships must dip their flags to them . An English fleet went into the Mediterranean ? the first English naval force to enter these waters ; it put right various grievances of the English shippers with Tuscany and Malta , and bombarded the pirate nest of Tunis and destroyed the pirate fleet ? which in the lax days of Charles had been wont to come right up to the coasts of Cornwall and Devon to intercept ships and carry off slaves to Africa .

" ( He died in 1657 , and was buried in Westminster Abbey , but after the restoration of the monarchy his bones were dug out by the order of Charles II , and removed to St. Margaret 's , Westminster . ) Such was the figure that England cut in the eyes of the world during her brief republican days . On September 3rd , 1658 , Cromwell died in the midst of a great storm that did not fail to impress the superstitious . Once his strong hand lay still , England fell away from this premature attempt to realize a righteous commonweal of free men . In 1660 Charles II , the son of Charles the " Martyr , " was welcomed back to England with all those manifestations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country relaxed from its military anti naval efficiency as a sleeper might wake and stretch and yawn after too intense a dream . The Puritans were done with . " Merrie England " was herself again , and in 1667 the Dutch , once more masters of the sea , sailed up the Thames to Gravesend and burnt an English fleet in the Medway . " On the night when our ships were burnt by the Dutch , " says Pepys , in his diary , " the King did sup with my Lady Castelmaine , and there they were all mad , hunting a poor moth . " Charles , from the date of his return , 1660 , took control of the foreign affairs of the State , and in 1670 concluded a secret treaty with Louis XIV of France by which he undertook to subordinate entirely English foreign policy to that of France for an annual pension of ? 100,000 . Dunkirk , which Cromwell had taken , had already been sold back to France . The King was a great sportsman ; he had the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Newmarket is perhaps his most characteristic monument . While Charles lived , his easy humour enabled him to retain the British crown , but he did so by wariness and compromise , and when in 1685 he was succeeded by his brother James II , who was a devout Catholic , and too dull to recognize the hidden limitation of the monarchy in Britain , the old issue between Parliament and Crown became acute . James set himself to force his country into a religious reunion with Rome . In 1688 he was in flight to France . But this time the great lords and merchants and gentlemen were too circumspect to let this revolt against the King fling them into the hands of a second Pride or a second Cromwell . They had already called in another king , William , Prince of Orange , to replace James . The change was made rapidly . There was no civil war ? except in Ireland ? and no release of any deeper revolutionary forces in the country . Of William 's claim to the throne , or rather of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its interest is purely technical , nor how William III and Mary ruled , nor how , after the widower William had reigned alone for a time , the throne passed on to Mary 's sister Anne ( 1702-14 ) . Anne seems to have thought favourably of a restoration of the Stuart line , but the Lords and the Commons , who now dominated English affairs , preferred a less competent king . Some sort of claim could be made out for the // Elector of Hanover , who became King of England as George I ( 1711-27 ) . He was entirely German , he could speak no English , and he brought a swarm of German women and German attendants to the English Court ; a dullness , a tarnish , came over the intellectual ' life of the land with his coming , but this isolation of the Court from English life was his conclusive recommendation to the great landowners and the commercial interests that chiefly brought him over . England entered upon a phase which Lord Beaconsfield has called the " Venetian oligarchy " stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Lords , for the art of bribery and a study of the methods of working elections , carried to a high pitch by Sir Robert Walpole , had robbed the House of Commons of its original freedom and vigour . By ingenious devices the parliamentary vote was restricted to a shrinking number of electors , old towns with little or no population would return one or two members ( old Sarum had one non-resident voter , no population , and two members ) , while newer populous centres had no representation at all . And by insisting upon a high property qualification for members , the chance of the Commons speaking in common accents of vulgar needs was still more restricted . George I was followed by the very similar George II ( 1727-60 ) , and it was only at his death that England had again a king who had been born in England , and one who could speak English fairly well , his grandson George III . On this monarch 's attempt to recover some of the larger powers of monarchy we shall have something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of the struggle in England during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries between the three main factors in the problem of the " modern state " ; between the Crown , the private property owners , and that vague power , still blind and ignorant , the power of the quite common people . This latter factor appears as yet only at moments when the country is most deeply stirred ; then it sinks back into the depths . But the end of the story , thus far , is a very complete triumph of the British private property owner over the dreams and schemes of Machiavellian absolutism . With the Hanoverian Dynasty , England became ? as The Times recently styled her ? a " crowned republic . " She had worked out a new method of government , Parliamentary government , recalling in many ways the Senate and Popular Assembly of Rome , but more steadfast and efficient because of // wall of pikes or bayonets . For this they needed great discipline and experience . Iron cannon were still of small size and not very abundant , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warfare . They could " plough lanes " in infantry , but they could not easily smash and scatter it if it was sturdy and well drilled . War under these conditions was entirely in the hands of seasoned professional soldiers , and the question of their pay was as important a one to the generals of that time as the question of food or munitions : As the long struggle dragged on from phase to phase , and the financial distress of the land increased , the commanders of both sides were forced to fall back upon the looting of towns and villages , both for supply and to make up the arrears of their soldiers ' pay . The soldiers became , therefore , more and more mere brigands living on the country , and the Thirty Years ' War set up a tradition of looting as a legitimate operation in warfare and of outrage as a soldier 's privilege that has tainted the good name of Germany right down to the Great War of 1914 . The earlier chapters of Defoe 's Memoirs of a Cavalier , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will give the reader a far better idea of the warfare of this time than any formal history . So harried was the land that the farmers ceased from cultivation , what snatch crops could be harvested were hidden away , and great crowds of starving women and children became camp followers of the armies , and supplied a thievish tail to the rougher plundering . At the close of the struggle all Germany was ruined and desolate . Central Europe did not fully recover from these robberies and devastations for a century . Here we can but name Tilly and Wallenstein , the great plunder captains on the Habsburg side , and Gustavus Adolphus , the King of Sweden , the Lion of the North , the champion of the Protestants , whose dream was to make the Baltic Sea a " Swedish Lake . " Gustavus Adolphus was killed in his decisive victory over Wallenstein at Liitzen ( 1632 ) , and Wallenstein was murdered in 1634 . In 1648 the princes and diplomatists gathered amidst the havoc they had made to patch up the affairs of Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of the Emperor was reduced to a shadow , and the acquisition of Alsace brought France up to the Rhine . And one German prince , the Hohenzollern Elector of Brandenburg , acquired so much territory as to become the greatest German power next to the Emperor , a power that presently ( 1701 ) became the kingdom of Prussia . // The treaty of Westphalia also recognized two long accomplished facts , the separation from the empire and the complete independence of both Holland and Switzerland . ? 5 We have opened this chapter with the stories of two countries , the Netherlands and Britain , in which the resistance of the private citizen to this new type of monarchy , the Machiavellian monarchy , that was arising out of the moral collapse of Christendom , succeeded . B u t i n France , Russia , in many parts of Germany and of Italy ? Saxony and Tuscany e.g. ? personal monarchy was not so restrained and overthrown ; it established itself , indeed , as the ruling European system during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the eighteenth century . ( In Poland conditionswere peculiar , and they will be dealt with in a later section . ) In France there had been no Magna Charta , and there was not quite so definite and effective a tradition of parliamentar3 rule . There was the same opposition of interests between the crown on the one hand and the landlords and merchants on the other , but the latter had no recognized gathering-place , and no dignified method of unity . They formed oppositions to the crown , they made leagues of resistance ? such was the " Fronde , " which // was struggling against the young King Louis XIV and his great minister Mazarin , while Charles I was , fighting for his life in England ? but ultimately ( 1652 ) , after a civil war , they were conclusively defeated ; and while in England after the establishment of the Hanoverians the House of Lords and their subservient Commons ruled the country , in France , on the contrary , after 1652 , the Court entirely dominated the aristocracy . Cardinal Mazarin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary of King James I of England , had prepared for him . After the time of Mazarin we hear of no great French nobles unless they are at Court as Court servants and officials . They have been bought and tamed ? but at a price , the price of throwing the burthen of taxation upon the voiceless mass of the common people . From many taxes both the clergy and the nobility ? everyone indeed who bore a title ? were exempt . In the end this injustice became intolerable , but for a while the French monarchy flourished like the Psalmist 's green bay tree . By the opening of the eighteenth century English writers are already calling attention to the misery of the French lower classes and the comparative prosperity , at that time , of the English poor . On such terms of unrighteousness , what we may call " Grand Monarchy " established itself in France . Louis XIV , styled the Grand Monarque , reigned for the unparalleled length of seventytwo years ( 1643-1715 ) , and set a pattern for all the kings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Machiavellian minister , Cardinal Mazarin ; after the death of the Cardinal he himself , in his own proper person , became the ideal " Prince . " He was , within his limitations , an exceptionally capable king ; his ambition was . stronger than his baser passions , and he guided his country towards bankruptcy through the complication of a spirited foreign policy with an elaborate dignity that still exhorts our admiration . His immediate desire was to consolidate and extend France to the Rhine and Pyrenees , and to absorb the Spanish Netherlands ; his remoter view saw the French kings as the possible successors of Charlemagne in a recast Holy Roman Empire . He made bribery a State method almost more important than warfare . Charles II of England was in his pay , and so were most of the Polish nobility , presently to be described . His money , or rather the money of the tax-paying classes in France , went everywhere . But his prevailing occupation was splendour . His great palace at Versailles , with its salons , its corridors , its mirrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the envy and admiration of the world . He provoked a universal imitation . Every king and princelet in Europe was building his own Versailles as much beyond his means as his subjects and credits would permit . Everywhere the nobility rebuilt or extended their chateaux to the new pattern . A great industry of beautiful and elaborate fabrics and furnishings developed . The luxurious arts flourished everywhere ; sculpture in alabaster , faience , gilt wood-work , metal work , stamped leather , much music , magnificent painting , beautiful printing and bindings , fine cookery , fine vintages . Amidst the mirrors and fine furniture // went a strange race of " gentlemen " in vast powdered wigs , silks and laces , poised upon high red heels , supported by amazing canes ; and still more wonderful " ladies , " tinder towers of powdered hair and wearing vast expansions of silk and satin sustained on wire . Through it all postured the great Louis , the sun of his world , unaware of the meagre and sulky and bitter faces that watched him from those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can not give here at any length the story of the wars and doings of this monarch . In many ways Voltaire 's Siecle de Louis XIV is still the best and most wholesome account . He created a French navy fit to face the English and Dutch ; a very considerable achievement . But because his intelligence did not rise above the lure of that Fata Morgana , that crack in the political wits of Europe , the dream of a world-wide Holy Roman Empire , he drifted in his later years to the propitiation of the Papacy , which had hitherto been hostile to him . He set himself against those spirits of independence and disunion , the Protestant Princes , and he made war against Protestantism in France . Great numbers of his most sober and valuable subjects were driven abroad by his religious persecutions , taking arts and industries with them . The English silk manufacture , for instance , was founded by French Protestants . Under his rule were carried out the " dragonnades , " a peculiarly malignant and effectual form of persecution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and were free to disorder the life of their hosts and insult their womankind as they thought fit . Men yielded to that sort of pressure who would not have yielded to rack and fire . The education of the next generation of Protestants was broken up , and the parents had to give Catholic instruction or none . They gave it , no doubt , with a sneer and an intonation that destroyed all faith in it . While more tolerant countries became mainly sincerely Catholic or sincerely Protestant , the persecuting countries , like France and Spain and Italy , so destroyed honest Protestant teaching that these people became mainly Catholic believers or Catholic atheists , ready to break out into blank atheism whenever the opportunity offered . The next reign , that of Louis XV , was the age of that supreme mocker Voltaire ( 1694-4778 ) , an age in which everybody in French society conformed to the Roman Church and hardly anyone believed in it . It was part ? and an excellent part ? of the pose of Grand Monarchy to patronize literature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sciences in rivalry with the English Royal Society of Charles II and the similar association at Florence . He decorated his Court with poets , playwrights , philosophers , and scientific men . If the scientific process got little inspiration from this patronage it did at any rate acquire resources for experiment and publication , and a certain prestige in the eyes of the vulgar . The literary activities of France and England set the key of most of the literary activities of Europe during this period of big and little Grand Monarchs , of great country houses and of growing commercial powers . French conditions were much more monarchist than the English , more centralized and uniform . The French writers lacked the great tradition of such a free and undisciplined spirit as Shakespeare , French intellectual life centred upon the Court and was more conscious of control than the English ; it never produced such literary " common men " as the English Bunyan , and in the seventeenth century it had no such release of the dissentient spirit as the Commonweal , to liberate a Milton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was more completely tinder the sway of the schoolmaster and the scholarly critic . It subordinated substance to style . The organization of an Academy still further restrained its already excessive restraints . As a consequence of these differences , this French literature before the nineteenth century was saturated with literary self-consciousness , and seems to have been written rather in the spirit of a good scholar who fears bad marks than in that of a man seeking frank expression . It is a literature of cold , correct and empty masterpieces , tragedies , comedies , romances and critical dissertations extraordinarily devoid of vitality . Eminent among the practitioners of dramatic correctitude were Corneille ( 1606 ? 1684 ) and Racine ( 1639-1699 ) . They were men of commanding genius ; those who study them closely are most aware of their essential fire ; but to those untrained in the conventions of the period they are at first almost as forbidding as monumental masonry ( which also at times can conceal deep feeling ) . Moliere ( 1622 ? 73 ) also triumphed over his period with comedies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almost the only vein of easy , vivid and interesting reading to be found among this genteel and stately mental furniture of the French Grand Monarchy is to be found in the gossiping and scandalous memoirs of the time . There is that , and there is some lively social and political controversy . Some of the , brightest and best writing in French during this // time was done out of France by Frenchmen in exile and in revolt . Descartes ( 1596-1650 ) , the greatest of French philosophers , lived for most of his life in the comparative security of Holland . He is the central and dominant figure of a constellation of speculative minds which were active in undermining , modifying and dwarfing the genteel Christianity of their age . Towering above all these other exiles and above all other contemporary European writers is the great figure of Voltaire , of whose mental attitude we shall speak later . Jean Jacques Rousseau ( 1712 ? 1778 ) , another outcast spirit , with his sentimental attack on formal morals and his sentimental idealization of nature and freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and country . Of him , also , we shall have more to say . The English literature of the seventeenth century reflected the less stable and centralized quality of English affairs and had more vigour and less polish than the French . The English Court and capital had not swallowed up the national life as the French had done . Against Descartes and his school one may put Bacon , of whom we have already told in our account of the scientific renaissance , and Hobbes and Locke . Milton ( 1608 ? 1674 ) wore a mixed garment of Greek and Latin learning , Italian culture and Puritanical theology , with a glory all his own . There was a considerable free literature outside the range of classical influence finding perhaps its most characteristic expression in Bunyan 's Pilgrim 's Progress ( 1678 ) . The still underrated creative work of Defoe ( 1659 ? 1731 ) again , is manifestly addressed to a public innocent of the accomplishments and affectations of the academic world . His Robinson Crusoe is among the great inventions of literature . His Moll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that and his fictitious developments of history are technically far in advance of any of his contemporaries . Nearly on a level with him was Fielding , the London magistrate , the author of Tom Jones . Samuel Richardson , the linendraper who wrote Pamela and Clarissa , was a third great figure among the living realities of English literature in the eighteenth century , the literature that did not trouble to be literary , and with these three it is the custom of criticism to associate the name of the far inferior Smollett . With these names and with that of J. J. Rousseau , the novel , the pseudo-real account of ways of living , of going about in the world , of the encounter with moral problems , comes back into importance . It disappeared in the decline of the Roman Empire . Its return marks the release of new , indeterminate sorts of people // curious about life and conduct , people of some leisure , people anxious to supplement their own experience by stories of kindred adventures . Life has become less urgent and more interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary parenthesis , we may note also as significant in English literature the graceful emptiness of Addison ( 1672-1719 ) and the lumpish lovableness of Dr. Samuel Johnson ( 1709-1784 ) , the compiler of the first English dictionary . Of his actual writings scarcely anything except a few short lives of the poets remains readable , but his sayings and oddities have been preserved for all time in the inimitable biography of Boswell . Alexander Pope ( 1688-1744 ) , classical in intention and French in spirit , translated Homer and transmuted a broadly Deistic philosophy into neatly polished verse . The most powerful writing of this age of polite and secondary men in England as in France came from a spirit in exasperated conflict with the current order , and , indeed , with the whole order of the world , Swift ( 1667-1745 ) , the author of Gulliver 's Travels . Laurence Sterne ( 1713-1768 ) , the rather disreputable clergyman who wrote Tristram Shanr-dv and taught later novelists a hundred turns and devices , drew his vitality from the greatness of the preclassical Frenchman Rabelais . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequent section , and then we will animadvert again upon the peculiar mental limitation 's of this gentlemanly age . The Grand Monarque died in 1715 . Louis XV was his greatgrandson and an incompetent imitator of his predecessor 's magnificence . He posed as a king , but his ruling passion was that common obsession of our kind , the pin-suit of women , tempered by a superstitious fear of hell . How such women as the Duchess of Chateauroux , Madame de Pompadour , and Madams du Barry dominated the pleasures of the king , and- how wars and alliances were made , provinces devastated , thousands of people killed , because of the vanities and spites of these creatures , and how all the public life of France and Europe was tainted with intrigue and prostitution and imposture because of them , the reader must learn from the memoirs of the time . The spirited foreign policy went on steadily under Louis XV towards its final smash . In 1774 this Louis , Louis the Well-Beloved , as his flatterers called him , died of smallpox , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a dull , well-meaning man , an excellent shot , and an amateur locksmith of some ingenuity . Of how he came to follow Charles I to the scaffold we shall tell in a later // section . Our present concern is with Grand Monarchy in the days of its glory . Among the chief practitioners of Grand Monarchy outside France we may note first the Prussian kings , Frederick William I ( 1713-40 ) , and his son and successor , Frederick II , Frederick the Great ( 1740 ? 86 ) . The story of the slow rise of the Hohenzollern family , which ruled the kingdom of Prussia , from inconspicuous beginnings is too tedious and unimportant for us to follow here . It is a story of luck and violence , of bold claims and sudden betrayals . It is told with great appreciation in Carlyle 's Frederick the Great . By the eighteenth century the Prussian kingdom was important enough to threaten the empire ; it had a strong , welldrilled army , and its king was an attentive and worthy student of Machiavelli . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the park of Sans Souci , with its fountains , avenues , statuary , aped its model ; there , also , was the New Palace , a vast brick building erected at enormous expense , the Orangery in the Italian style , with a collection of pictures , a Marble Palace , and so on . Frederick carried culture to the pitch of authorship , and corresponded with and entertained Voltaire , to their mutual exasperation . The Austrian dominions were kept too busy between the hammer of the French and the anvil of the Turks to develop the real Grand Monarch style until the reign of Maria-Theresa ( who , being a woman , did not bear the title of Empress ) ( 1740-80 ) . Joseph II , who was Emperor from 1765-90 , succeeded to her palaces in 1780 . With Peter the Great ( 1682 ? 1725 ) the empire of Muscovy broke away from her Tartar traditions and entered the sphere of French attraction . Peter shaved the Oriental beards of his nobles and introduced Western costume . These were but the outward and visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Asiatic feeling and traditions of Moscow , which , like Peking has a sacred inner city , the Kremlin , he built himself a new capital , Petrograd , upon the swamp of the Neva . And of course he built his Versailles , the Peterhof , about eighteen miles from this new Paris , employing a French architect and having a terrace , fountans , cascades , picture gallery , park , and all the recognized features . His more distinguished successors were Elizabeth ( 1741 ? 62 ) and Catherine the Great , a German princess , who , after obtaining the crown in sound Oriental fashion through the murder of her husband , the legitimate Tsar , reverted to adPRINCES , // vanced Western ideals and ruled with great vigour from 1762 to 1796 . She set up an academy , and corresponded with Voltaire . And she lived to witness the . end of the system of Grand Monarchy in Europe and the execution of Louis XVI . We can not even catalogue here the minor Grand Monarchs of the time in Florence ( Tuscany ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under a score of names , is starred in every volume of Baedeker , and the tourist gapes in their palaces . Nor can we deal with the war of the Spanish Succession . Spain , overstrained by the imperial enterprises of Charles V and Philip II , and enfeebled by a bigoted persecution of Protestants , Moslems , and Jews , was throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries sinking down from her temporary importance in European affairs to the level of a secondary power again . These European monarchs ruled their kingdoms as their noblemen ruled their estates : they plotted against one another , they were politic and far-seeing in an unreal fashion , they made wars , they spent the substance of Europe upon absurd " policies " of aggression and resistance. - At last there burst upon them a great storm out of the depths . That storm , the First French Revolution , the indignation of the common man in Europe , took their system unawares . It was but the opening outbreak of a great cycle of political and social storms that still continues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been swept out of the world and the skies clear again for the great peace of the federation of mankind . ? 6 The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were a period of vigorous progress in music . The intellectual instrument had been elaborated ; the major and minor scales with their fixed succession of notes , their adaptability to modulation and their possibilities of harmonic colour , were established . It was possible to define a musical intention clearly , to regulate the co-operation of diverse instruments with great exactitude . And social conditions , the growing towns , the Courts , the country houses were adding new fields of musical possibility to the older range of the church choirs . Masques and pageants had been popular in the sixteenth century ; they gave opportunities for elaborate music ; and with the seventeenth came a great development to operas and oratorios . In Italy appeared the " Nuove Musiche . " Lully ( 1635-4687 ) , // says Sir W. H. Hadow , " is the most important historically , not only for the dramatic power of his melody but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him stands the Italian Monteverde . Music began to work upon a large scale in this period . " The sixteenth-century Masses were written for the church choir , the sixteenth-century madrigals for a party of friends round the supper-table ; only towards its end do the lutenists and the virginalists begin to introduce into executive art the conception of the virtuoso . . . . The vast improvement in organ building brought with it a succession of great performers : Bull and Philips the Englishmen , Sweelinck the Netherlander , Frescobaldi at Rome , Froberger in Vienna , Buxtehude in Lubeck , whom Bach travelled on foot to hear . . . . Along with this goes the development of virginal music . . . . Not less momentous was the arrival , and the tardy acceptance , of the violin and its family . Dating from Tieffenbrucker and the Amatis in the first half of the sixteenth century , it took nearly a hundred years to make its way into public favour ; as late as 1676 Mace , the lutenist , can still inveigh against the scoulding violins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone of its ancestor the viol . But its wider compass , its greater agility and its more poignant power of expression made themselves felt in the long run . . . . In Italy , its natural home , though clumsily held and clumsily played , it came to be recognized as the only instrument which could rival the human voice . " l For a time , we are told , the display and adoration of the vocalist in Italian opera retarded musical development ; the seventeenth-century singers , and especially the male sopranos , sustained almost as vulgar and terrible a fame as the modern film star , yet the period produced the abundant and beautiful music of Alessandro Scarlatti ( 1659-1725 ) , the precursor of Mozart . In England a great outburst of musical activity followed a phase of quiescence during the Commonweal and culminated in Purcell ( 1658-1695 ) . In Germany the little Courts and town-bands provided numberless centres of musical stimulation , and in 1685 in Saxony J. S. Bach and Handel were born , to carry German music to a pitch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half . " Of all composers , " says Sir W. H. Hadow , " before the Viennese period they are the most closely related to our own day , their voices sound in our ears with the most familiar accents . " // Palestrina , who marked a previous culmination in music , is by comparison , a being in a different world . He was the crowning master of choral music before the days of instrumental achievement . Following upon the names of Bach and Handel came others in a constellation ; Haydn ( 1732 ? 1809 ) , Mozart ( 1756 ? 1791 ) , Beethoven ( 1770 ? 1827 ) , stand out among the brightest stars . The great stream of modern ' music was now flowing wide and deep . And still flows . Here we can but name composers and further on give , in a brief paragraph or so , a few compact generalizations about the music of the nineteenth century and our own days . At the time of its making this seventeenth and eighteenth-century music was the privilege of a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns and country houses who could organize performances , people in cities large enough for operahouses and concert-rooms . The peasant and the worker of Western Europe had less and less music in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries while these new forms were developing . Folk singing had declined and seemed likely to be forgotten . A few popular songs , a few hymns , was all the musical life left to the generality of people . Religious revivals in those days probably owed something of their impetus to their release of the pent-up singing impulse . It is only to-day , with a vast development of the mechanical methods of musical production that music , modernized , evolved and exalted , returns into the common life , and Bach and Beethoven become a part of the general culture of mankind . ? 7 The painting and architecture of this period , like its music , reflect the social conditions of the time . It is a time of fragmentation for ideas and for power , and no longer do considerations of object and dignity dominate pictorial art . Religious subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dealt with they are dealt with as incidents in a narrative and not as great spectacular facts . Allegory and symbolic figures decline . The painter paints for the sake of the vision and neither for the idea nor the fact . The picture of reality replaces the heroic or devotional picture just as the novel replaces the epic and the fantastic romance . The two supreme masters in the painting of the seventeenth century are Velazquez ( 1599 ? 1660 ) and Rembrandt ( 1606-1669 ) . To them it would seem all life was equal except in so far as it gave them more or less scope for the realization // of beauty , in atmosphere , in light , in substance . Velazquez at the decaying Court of Spain painted popes and kings without flattery , and dwarfs and cripples without contempt . Minute , analytical and documentary drawing of objects gives place in the work of these , the first of the moderns , to a broad rendering of effect , to a concentration upon unity of impression at the cost of all secondary considerations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the picture had been a witness , an exhortation , a flatterer , an embellishment ; now , in a great many cases , it became a thing in itself , existing for the sake of itself . Pictures were hung up as pictures ? collected into galleries . Landscape developed vigorously , also genre painting . The nude was painted pleasantly and excitingly , and in France Watteau , Fragonard and others delighted and flattered the gentlefolk with a delicate apotheosis of the facts of country life . One realizes in these things the evidences of a growing community of secure , prosperous and quite finespirited people , appreciative of life and a little detached from either its magnificences or its sufferings . The Elizabethan period in England . had no plastic enthusiasms to match its literary and musical activities . It imported its painters and architects . But in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the accumulating wealth and prosperity of what had hitherto been a very marginal country in European civilization created conditions favourable to artistic effort , and in the eighteenth century such English painters as Reynolds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Romney could challenge comparison with any contemporary effort . This period of the monarchies and gentlefolk was also extremely favourable to the development of certain types of architecture . Processes already active in the sixteenth century were going on now with enhanced vigour . Everywhere monarchs were building and rebuilding palaces , and the nobles and gentry were demolishing their castles and replacing them with fine houses . The town house was being conceived upon an ampler scale . Ecclesiastical architecture had waned ; municipal effort was relatively less important : it is the large prosperous individual in this as in all things who sets the key of the period . In England the burning of a large part of London in the Great Fire of 1666 gave peculiar opportunity to Sir Christopher Wren , and his Saint Paul 's Cathedral and his London churches mark a culminating phase in the history of British architecture . Drawings were sent by him to America for various country houses erected there , and his // peculiar genius stamped itself also upon early American design . Inigo Jones was a second great figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his Banqueting Hall ? it was to have been part of an unfinished palace in Whitehall ? makes his work familiar to every visitor to London . Both these men , and indeed all English , French and German architects of this period , were working upon the still living and developing lines of the Italian Renaissance , and many of the best buildings of these countries were , the work of Italians . Gradually , as the eighteenth century drew to its end , the free and natural development of Renaissance architecture was checked by a wave of classical pedantry . The gradual coagulation of classical studies in the schools of Western Europe had its correlative in a growing tendency to imitate Greek and Roman models . What had once been a stimulant was now becoming a traditional and stupefying mental drug . Banks , churches , museums , were dressed up as Athenian temples , and , even terraces of houses were subjected to the colonnade . But the worst excesses of this deadening tendency were in the nineteenth century and beyond the limits of our present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a world-rule and a community of mankind first came into human affairs , and we have traced how the failure of the Christian churches to sustain and establish those conceptions of its founder , led to a moral collapse in political affairs , and a reversion to egotism and want of faith . We have seen , how Machiavellian monarchy set itself up against the spirit of brotherhood in Christendom and how Machiavellian monarchy developed throughout a large part of Europe into the Grand Monarchies and Parliamentary Monarchies of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . But the mind and imagination of man is incessantly active , and beneath the sway of the grand monarchs , a complex of notions and traditions was being woven as a net is woven , to catch and entangle men 's minds , the conception of international politics not as a matter of dealings between princes but as a matter of dealings between a kind of immortal Beings , the Powers . The Princes came and went ; a Louis XIV would be followed by a petticoat-hunting Louis XV , and he again by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave place to a succession of empresses ; the chief continuity of the Habsburgs after Charles V , either in // Austria or Spain , was a continuity of thick lips , clumsy chins , and superstition ; the amiable scoundrelism of a Charles II would . 1 make a mock of his own pretensions . But what remained much more steadfast were the secretariats of the foreign ministries and the ideas of people who wrote of State concerns . The ministers maintained a continuity of policy during the " off days " of their monarchs , and between one monarch and another . So we find that the prince gradually became less important in men 's minds than the " Power " of which he was the head . We begin to read less and less of the schemes and ambitions of King This or That , and more of the " Designs of France " or the " Ambitions of Prussia . " In an age when religious faith was declining , we find men displaying a new and vivid belief in the reality of these personifications . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insensibly into European political thought , until in the later eighteenth and in the nineteenth centuries they dominated it entirely . To this day they dominate it . European life remained nominally Christian , but to worship one God in spirit and in truth is to belong to one community with all one 's fellow worshippers . In practical reality Europe does not do this , she has given herself up altogether to the worship of this strange State mythology . To these sovereign deities , to the unity of " Italy , " to the hegemony of " Prussia , " to the glory of " France , " and the destinies of " Russia , " she has sacrificed many generations of possible unity , peace , and prosperity and the lives of millions of men . To regard a tribe or a state as a sort of personality is a very old disposition of the human mind . The Bible abounds in such personifications . Judah , Edom , Moab , Assyria figure in the Hebrew Scriptures as if they were individuals ; it is sometimes impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or with a nation . It is manifestly a primitive and natural tendency . But in the case of modern Europe it is a retrocession . Europe , under the idea of Christendom , had gone far towards unification . And while such tribal persons as " Israel " or " Tyre " did represent a certain community of blood , a certain uniformity of type , and a homogeneity of interest , the European powers which arose in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were entirely fictitious unities . Russia was in truth an assembly of the most incongruous elements , Cossacks , Tartars , Ukrainians , Muscovites , and , after the time of Peter , Esthonians and Lithuanians ; the France of Louis XV comprehended German Alsace and // freshly assimilated regions of Burgundy ; it was a prison of suppressed Huguenots and a sweating-house for peasants . In " Britain , " England carried on her back the Hanoverian dominions in Germany , Scotland , the profoundly alien Welsh and the hostile and Catholic Irish . Such powers as Sweden , Prussia , and still more so Poland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of historical maps , contract , expand , thrust out extensions , and wander over the map of Europe as amoeba do under the microscope . . . . If we consider the psychology of international relationship as we see it manifested in the world about us , and as it is shown by the development of the " Power " idea in modern Europe , we shall realize certain historically very important facts about the nature of man . Aristotle said that man is a political animal , but in our modern sense of the word politics , which now covers world-politics , he is nothing of the sort . He has still the instincts of the farhily tribe , and beyond that he has a disposition to attach himself and his family to something larger , to a tribe , a city , a nation , or a state . But that disposition , left to itself , is a vague and very uncritical.disposition . If anything , he is inclined to fear and dislike criticism of this something larger that encloses his life and to which he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has a subconscious fear of the isolation that may ensue if the system is broken or discredited . He takes the milieu in which he finds himself for granted ; he accepts his ' city or his government , just as he accepts the nose or the digestion which fortune has bestowed upon him . But men 's loyalties , the sides they take in political things , are not innate , they are educational results . For most men their education in these matters is the silent , continuous education of things about them . Men find themselves a part of Merry England or Holy Russia ; they grow up into these devotions ; they accept them as a part of their nature . , It is only slowly that the world is beginning to realize how profoundly the tacit education of circumstances can be supplemented , modified , or corrected by positive teaching , by literature , discussion , and properly criticized experience . The real life of the ordinary man is his everyday life , his little circle of affections , fears , hungers , lusts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is directed to political affairs as something vitally affecting this personal circle , that he brings his reluctant mind to bear upon them . It is scarcely too much to say that the ordinary man thinks as little about political matters as he can , // and stops thinking about them as soon as possible . It is still only very curious and exceptional minds , or minds that have by example or good education acquired the scientific habit of wanting to know why , or minds shocked and distressed by some public catastrophe and roused to wide apprehensions of danger , that will not accept governments and institutions , however preposterous , that do not directly annoy them , as satisfactory . The ordinary human being , until he is so aroused , will acquiesce in any collective activities that are going on in this world in which he finds himself , and any phrasing or symbolization that meets his vague need for something greater to which his personal affairs , his individual circle , can be anchored . If we keep these manifest limitations of our nature in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of Christianity as a world brotherhood of men sank into discredit because of its fatal entanglement with priestcraft and the Papacy on the one hand and with the authority of princes on the other , and the age of faith passed into our present age of doubt and disbelief , men shifted the reference of their lives from the kingdom of God and the brotherhood of mankind to these apparently more living realities , France and England , Holy Russia , Spain , Prussia , which were at least embodied in active Courts , which maintained laws , exerted power through armies and navies , waved flags with a compelling solemnity and were self-assertive and insatiably greedy in an entirely human and understandable fashion , Certainly such men as Cardinal Richelieu and Cardinal Mazarin thought of themselves as serving greater ends than their own or their monarch 's ; they served the quasi-divine France of their imaginations . And as certainly these habits of mind percolated down from them to their subordinates and to the general body of the population . In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the nineteenth it had become wholly patriotic . In a crowded English or French or German railway carriage of the later nineteenth century it would have aroused far less hostility to have jeered at God than to have jeered at one of those strange beings , England or France or Germany . To these things men 's minds clung , and they clung to them because in all the world there appeared nothing else so satisfying to cling to . They were the real and living gods of Europe . This idealization of governments and foreign offices , this mythology of " Powers " and their loves and hates and conflicts , // has so obsessed the imaginations of Europe and Western Asia as to provide it with its " forms of thought . " Nearly all the histories , nearly all the political literature of the last two centuries in Europe , have been written in its phraseology . Yet a time is coming when -a clearer-sighted generation will read with perplexity how in the community of Western Europe , consisting everywhere of very slight variations of a common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mongolian elements , speaking nearly everywhere modifications of the same Aryan speech , having a common past in the Roman Empire , common religious forms , common social usages , and a common art and science , and intermarrying so freely that no one could tell with certainty the " nationality " of any of his great-grandchildren , , men could , be moved to the wildest excitement upon the question of the ascendancy of " France , " the rise and unification of " Germany , " the rival claims of " Russia " and " Greece " to possess Constantinople . These conflicts will seem then as reasonless and insane as those dead , now incomprehensible feuds of the " greens " and " blues " that once filled the streets of Byzantium with shouting and bloodshed . Tremendously as these phantoms , the Powers , rule our minds and lives to-day , they are , as this history shows clearly , things only of the last few centuries , a mere hour , an incidental phase , in the vast deliberate history of our kind . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rise of Machiavellian monarchy marks a backwater ; they are part of the same eddy of faltering faith , in a process altogether greater and altogether different in its general tendency , the process of . the moral and intellectual reunion of mankind . For a time men have relapsed upon these national or imperial gods of theirs ; it is but for a time . The idea of the world-State , the universal kingdom of righteousness of which every living soul shall be a citizen , was already in the world two thousand years ago , never more to leave it . Men know that it is present even when they refuse to recognize it . In the writings and talk of men about international affairs to-day in the current discussions of historians and political journalists , there is an effect of drunken " men growing sober , and terribly afraid of growing sober . They still talk loudly of their " love " for France , of their " hatred " of Germany , of the " traditional ascendancy of Britain at sea , " and so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cups in spite of the steadfast onset of sobriety and a headache . These are dead gods they serve . By sea or land men want no // Powers ascendant , but only law and service . That silent unavoidable challenge is in all our minds like dawn breaking slowly , shining between the shutters of a disordered room . ? 9 The seventeenth century in Europe was the century of Louis XIV ; he and French ascendancy and Versailles are the central motif of the story . The eighteenth century was equally the century of the " rise of Prussia as a great power , " and the chief figure in the story is Frederick II , Frederick the Great . Interwoven with his history is the story of Poland . The condition of affairs in Poland was peculiar . Unlike its three neighbours Prussia , Russia , and the Austro-Hungarian monarchy of the Habsburgs , Poland had not developed a Grand Monarchy . Its , . system of government may be best described as republican with a king , an elected life president . Each king was separately elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but its republicanism was more aristocratic in form . Poland had little trade and few manufactures ; she was agricultural and still with great areas of grazing , forest , and waste ; she was a poor country , and her landowners K were poor aristocrats . The mass of her population was a downtrodden and savagely ignorant peasantry , and she also harboured great masses of very poor Jews . She had remained Catholic . She was , so // to speak , a poor Catholic inland Britain , entirely surrounded by enemies instead of by the sea . She had no definite boundaries at all , neither sea nor mountain . And it added to her misfortunes that some of her elected kings had been brilliant and aggressive rulers . Easttward her power extended weakly into regions inhabited almost entirely by Russians ; westward she overlapped a German subject population . Because she had no great trade , she had no great towns to compare with those of Western Europe , and no vigorous universities to hold her mind together . Her noble class lived on their estates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had an aristocratic sense of freedom ? which was entirely compatible with the systematic impoverishment of their serfs ? but their patriotism and freedom were incapable of effective cooperation . While warfare was a matter of levies of men and horses , Poland was a comparatively strong power ; but it was quite unable to keep pace with the development of military art that was making standing forces of professional soldiers the necessary weapon in warfare . Yet , divided and disabled as she was , she could yet count some notable vie tories to her credit . The last Turkish attack upon Vienna ( 1683 ) was defeated by the Polish cavalry under King John Sobiesky , King John III . ( This same Sobiesky , before he was elected king , had been in the pay of Louis XIV , and had also fought for the Swedes against his native country. ) // Needless to say , this weak aristocratic republic , with its recurrent royal elections , invited aggression from all three of its neighbours . " Foreign money , " and every sort of exterior interference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greeks of old , every disgruntled Polish patriot flew off to some foreign enemy to wreak his indignation upon his ungrateful country . Even when the King of Poland was elected , he had very little power because of the mutual jealousy of the nobles . Like the English peers , they preferred a foreigner , and for much the same reason , because he had no roots of power in the land ; but , unlike the British , their own government had not the solidarity which the periodic assembling of Parliament in London , the " coming up to town , " gave the British peers . In London there was " Society , " a continuous intermingling of influential persons and ideas . Poland had no London and no " Society . " So , practically , Poland had no central government at all . The King of Poland could not make war nor peace , levy a tax nor alter the law , without the consent of the Diet , and any single member of the Diet had the power of putting a veto upon any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " I disapprove , " and the matter dropped . He could even carry his free veto , his liberum veto , further . He could object to the assembly of the Diet , and the Diet was thereby dissolved . Poland was not simply a crowned aristocratic republic like the British , it was a paralyzed crowned aristocratic republic . To Frederick the Great , the existence of Poland was particularly provocative because of the way in which an arm of Poland reached out to the Baltic at Dantzig and separated his ancestral dominions in East Prussia from his territories within the empire . It was he who incited Catherine the Second of Russia and Maria Theresa of Austria , whose respect he had earned by depriving her of Silesia , to a joint attack upon Poland . Let four maps of Poland tell the tale . After this first outrage of 1772 Poland underwent a great change of heart . Poland was , indeed , born as a nation on the eve of her dissolution . There was a hasty but very considerable development of education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the impossible constitution that had made Poland impotent was swept aside . The free veto was abolished , the crown was made hereditary to save Poland from the foreign intrigues that attended every election , and a Parliament in imitation of the British was set up . There were , however , lovers of the old order in Poland who resented these necessary changes , and these obstrucPRINCES , // tives were naturally supported by Prussia and Russia , who wanted no Polish revival . Came the second partition , and , after a fierce patriotic struggle that began in the region annexed by Prussia and found a leader and national hero in Kosciusko , the final obliteration of Poland from the map . So for a time ended this Parliamentary threat to ' Grand Monarchy in Eastern Europe . But the patriotisrh of the Poles grew stronger and clearer with suppression . For a hundred and twenty years Poland struggled like a submerged creature beneath the political and military net that held her down . She rose again in 1918 , at the end of the Great War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascendancy of France in Europe , th'e swift decay of the sappy growth of Spanish power and its separation " from Austria , and the rise of Prussia . So far as Portugal , Spain , France , Britain , and Holland were concerned , their competition for ascendancy in Europe was extended and complicated by a struggle for dominion overseas . The discovery of the huge continent of America , thinly inhabited , undeveloped , and admirably adapted for European settlement and exploitation , the simultaneous discovery of great areas of unworked country south of the torrid equatorial regions of Africa that had hitherto limited European knowledge , and the gradual realization of vast island regions in the Eastern seas , as yet untouched by Western civilization , was a presentation of opportunity to mankind unprecedented in all history . It was as if the peoples of Europe had come into some splendid legacy . Their world had suddenly quadrupled . There was more than enough for all ; they had only to take these lands and continue to do well by them , and their crowded poverty would vanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ill-bred heirs ; it meant no more . to them than a fresh occasion for atrocious disputes . But what community of human beings has ever yet preferred creation to conspiracy ? What nation in all- our story has ever worked with another when , at any cost to itself , it could contrive to that other an injury ? The powers of Europe began by a frantic " claiming " of the new realms . They went on to exhausting conflicts . Spain , who claimed first and most , and who was for a time " mistress " of two-thirds of America , made no better use of her possession than to bleed herself nearly to death therein . We have told how the Papacy in its last assertion of world // a dominion , instead of maintaining the common duty of all Christendom to make a great common civilization in the new lands , divided the American continent between Spain and Portugal . This naturally roused the hostility of the excluded nations . The seamen of England showed no respect for either claim , and set themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a similar account . The Hollanders , so soon as they had shaken off their Spanish masters , also set their sails westward to flout the Pope and share in the good things of the New World . His Most Catholic Majesty of France hesitated as little as any Protestant . All these powers were soon busy staking out claims in North America and the West Indies . Neither the Danish kingdom ( which at that time included Norway and Iceland ) nor the Swedes secured very much in the scramble . The Danes annexed some of the West Indian islands . Sweden got none . Both Denmark and Sweden at this time were deep in the affairs of Germany . We have already named Gustavus Adolphus , the Protestant " Lion of the North , " and mentioned his campaigns in Germany , Poland and . Russia . These Eastern European regions are great absorbents of energy , and the strength that might have given Sweden a large share in the new world reaped a barren harvest of glory in Europe . Such small settlements as the Swedes made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , with the French monarchy under Cardinal Richelieu and under Louis XIV eating its way across the Spanish Netherlands towards their frontier , had not the undistracted resources that Britain , behind her " silver streak " of sea , could put into overseas adventures . Moreover , the absolutist efforts of James I and Charles I , and the restoration of Charles II , had the effect of driving out from England a great number of sturdy-minded , republican-spirited Protestants , men of substance and character , who set up in America , and particularly in New England , out of reach , as they supposed , of the king and his taxes . The Mayflower was only one of the pioneer vessels of a stream of emigrants . It was the luck of Britain that they remained , though dissentient in spirit , under the British flag . The Dutch never sent out settlers of the same quantity and quality , first because their Spanish rulers would not let them , and then because they had got possession of their own country . And though there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persecution of Louis XIV , they had Holland and England close at hand as refuges , and their // industry , skill and sobriety went mainly to strengthen those countries , . end particularly England . A few of them founded settlements in Carolina , but these did not remain French ; they fell first to the Spanish and finally to the English . The Dutch settlements , with the Swedish , also succumbed to Britain ; Nieuw Amsterdam became British in 1674 , and its name was changed to New York , as the reader may learn very cheerfully in Washington Irving 's Knickerbocker 's History . of New York . The state of affairs in North America in 1750 is indicated very clearly by a map we have adapted from one in Robinson 's Medieval and Modern Times . The British power was established along the east coast from Savannah to the St. Lawrence River , and Newfoundland and considerable northern areas , the Hudson Bay Company territories , had been acquired by treaty from the French . The British occupied Barbados ( almost their oldest American possession ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and British Honduras from the Spaniards . But France was pursuing a very dangerous and alarming game , a game even more dangerous and alarming on the map than in reality . She had made real settlements in Quebec and Montreal to the north and at New Orleans in the south , and her explorers and agents had pushed south and north , making treaties with the American Indians of the great plains and setting up claims ? without setting up towns ? right across the continent behind the British . But the realities of the case are not adequately represented in this way . The British colonies were being very solidly settled by a good class of people ; they already numbered a population of over a million ; the French at that time hardly counted.a tenth of that . They had a number of brilliant travellers and missionaries at work , but no substance of population behind them . Many old maps of America in this period are still to be found , maps designed to scare and " rouse " the British to a sense of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1754 , and in 1759 the British and Colonial forces under General Wolfe took Quebec and completed the conquest of Canada in the next year . In 1763 Canada was finally ceded to Britain . ( But the western part of the rather indefinite region of Louisiana in the south , named after Louis XIV , remained outside the British sphere . It was taken ove by Spain ; and in 1800 it was recovered by France . Finally , in 1803 , it was bought from France by the United States government . In this Canadian war the American colonists gained a considerable experience of the military art , and a knowledge of // British military organization that was to be of great use to them a little later . ? 11 It was not only in America that the French and British powers clashed . The condition of India at this time was one very interesting and attractive to European adventurers . The great Mongol Empire of Baber , Akbar , and Aurungzeb was now far gone in decay . What had happened to India was very parallel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Delhi in India , like the Holy Roman Emperor in Germany , was still legally overlord , but after the death of Aurungzeb he exerted only a , nominal authority except in the immediate neighbourhood of his capital . There had been a great revival of Hinduism and of the native spirit . In the south-west a Hindu people , the Mahrattas , had risen against Islam , restored Brahminism as the ruling religion , and for a time extended their power over the whole southern triangle of India . In Rajputana , also , the rule of Islam was replaced by Brahminism , and at Bhurtpur and Jaipur there ruled powerful Rajput princes . In Oudh there was a Shiite kingdom , with its capital at Lucknow , and Bengal was also a separate ( Moslem ) kingdom . Away in the Punjab to the north had arisen a very interesting religious body , the Sikhs , proclaiming the universal rule of one God and assailing both the Hindu Vedas and the Moslem Koran . Originally a pacific sect , the Sikhs presently followed the example of Islam and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish the kingdom of God by the sword . And into this confused and disordered but very vital renascent Indian India there presently ( 1738 ) carne an ? Invader from the north , Nadir Shah ( 1736-47 ) , the Turcoman ruler of Persia , who swept down through the Khyber Pass , broke every army that stood in his ' way , and captured and sacked Delhi , carrying off an enormous booty . He left the north of India so utterly broken , that in the next twenty years there were no less than six other successful plundering raids into North India from Afghanistan , which had become an independent state at the death of Nadir Shah . For a time Mahrattas fought with Afghans for the rule of North India ; then the Mahratta power broke up into a series of principalities , 1ndore , Gwalior , Baroda , and others . India in the eighteenth century was very like the Eur4e of the seventh and eighth centuries , a land of slow revival , distressed by foreign raiders . This was the India into which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other European powers had been struggling for a commercial and political footing in India and the east ever since Vasco da Gama had made his memorable voyage round the Cape to Calicut . The sea trade of India had previously been in the hands of the Red Sea Arabs , and the Portuguese won it from them in a series of sea fights . The Portuguese ships were the bigger , and carried a heavier armanent . For a time the Portuguese held the Indian trade as their own , and Lisbon outshone Venice as a mart for Oriental spices ; the seventeenth century , however , saw the Dutch grasping at this monopoly . At the crest of their power the Dutch had settlements at the Cape of Good Hope , they held Mauritius , they had two establishments in Persia , twelve in India , six in Ceylon , and all over the East Indies they had dotted their fortified stations . But their selfish resolution to exclude traders of any other European nationality forced the Swedes , Danes , French , // and English into hostile competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck in European waters by the victories of Blake , the English republican admiral ; and by the opening of the eighteenth century both the English and French were in vigorous competition with the Dutch for trade and privileges throughout India . At Madras , Bombay . and Calcutta the English established their headquarters ; Pondicherry and Chandernagore were the chief French settlements . At first all these European powers came merely as traders , and the only establishments they attempted were warehouses ; but the unsettled state of the country , and the unscrupulous methods of their rivals , made it naturist for them to fortify and arm their settlements , and this armament made them attractive allies of the various warring princes who now divided India . And it was en- // tirely in the spirit of the new European nationalist politics that when the French took one side , the British should take another . The great leader upon the English side was Robert Clive , who was born in 1725 , and went to India in 1743 . His chief antagonist was Dupleix . The story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too long and intricate to be told here . By 1761 the British found themselves completely dominant in the Indian peninsula . At Plassey ( 1757 ) and at Buxar ( 1764 ) their armies gained striking and conclusive victories over the army of Bengal and the army of Oudh . The Great Mogul , nominally their overlord , became in effect their puppet . They levied taxes over great areas ; they exacted indemnities for real or fancied opposition . These successes were not gained directly by the forces of the King of England ; they were gained by the East India Trading Company , which had been originally at the time of its incorporation under Queen Elizabeth no more than a company of sea adventurers . Step by step they had been forced to raise troops and arm their ships . And now this trading company , with its tradition of gain , found itself dealing not merely in spices and dyes and tea and jewels , but in the revenues and territories of princes and the destinies of India . It had come to buy and sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was no one to challenge its proceedings . Is it any wonder that its captains and cornmanders and officials , nay , even its clerks and common soldiers , came back to England loaded with spoils ? Men under such circumstances , with a great and wealthy land at their mercy , could not determine what they might or might not do . It was a strange land to them with a strange sunlight ; its brown people were a different race , outside their range of sympathy ; its temples and buildings seemed to sustain fantastic standards of behaviour . Englishmen at home were perplexed when presently these generals and officials came back to make dark accusations against each other of extortions and cruelties . Upon Clive Parliament passed a vote of censure . He committed suicide in 1774 . In 1788 Warren Hastings , a second great Indian administrator , was impeached and acquitted ( 17c2 ) . It was a strange and unprecedented situation in the world 's history . The English Parliament found itself ruling over a London trading company , which in its turn was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the domains of the British crown . To the bulk of the English people India was a remote , fantastic , almost inaccessible land , to // which adventurous poor young men went out , to return after many years very rich and very choleric old gentlemen . It was difficult for the English to conceive what the life of these countless brown millions in the eastern sunshine could be . Their imaginations declined the task . India remained romantically unreal . It was impossible for the English , therefore , to exert any effective supervision and control over the company 's proceedings . ? 12 And while the great peninsula of the south of Asia was thus falling under the dominion of the English sea traders , an equally remarkable reaction of Europe upon Asia was going on in the north . We have told how the Christian states of Russia recovered their independence from the Golden Horde , and how the Tsar of Moscow became master of the republic of Novgorod ; and in ? 5 of this chapter we have told of Peter the Great joining the circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia into Europe . The rise of this great central power of the old world , which is neither altogether of the East nor altogether of the West , is one of the utmost importance to our human destiny . We have also told in the same chapter of the appearance of a Christian steppe people , the Cossacks , who formed a barrier between the feudal agriculture of Poland and Hungary to the west and the Tartar to the east . The Cossacks , were the wild east of Europe , and in many ways not unlike the wild west of the United States in the middle nineteenth century . All who had made Russia too hot to hold them , criminals as well as the persecuted innocent , rebellious serfs , religious sectaries , thieves , vagabonds , murderers , sought asylum in the southern steppes , and there made a fresh start and fought for life and freedom against Pole , Russian , and Tartar alike . Doubtless fugitives from the Tartars to the east also contributed to the Cossack mixture . Chief among these new nomad tribes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cossacks on the Don . Slowly these border folks were incorporated in the Russian imperial service , much as the Highland clans of Scotland were converted into regiments by the British government . New lands were offered them * Asia . They became a weapon against the dwindling power of the Mongolian nomads , first in Turkestan and then across Siberia as far as the Amur . The decay of Mongol energy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is very difficult to explain . Within two or three centuries 1 // from the days of Jengis and Timurlane , central Asia had relapsed from a period of world ascendancy to extreme political impotence . Changes of climate , unrecorded pestilences , infections of a malarial type , may have played their part in this recession ? which may be only a temporary recession measured by the scale of universal history ? of the Central Asian peoples . Some authorities think that the spread of Buddhist teaching from China also had a pacifying influence upon them . At any rate , by the sixteenth century the Mongol Tartar and Turkish peoples were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjugated , and pushed back both by Christian Russia in the west and by China in the east . All through the seventeenth century the Cossacks were spreading eastward from European Russia , and settling wherever they found agricultural conditions . Cordons of forts and stations formed a moving frontier to these settlements to the south , where the Turkomans were still strong and active ; to the north-east , however , Russia had no frontier until she reached right to the Pacific . . . . At the same time China was in a phase of expansion . The Manchu conquerors had brought a new energy into Chinese affairs , and their northern interests led to a considerable northward expansion of the Chinese civilization and influence into Manchuria and Mongolia . So it was that by the middle of the eighteenth century the Russians and Chinese were in contact in Mongolia . At this period China ruled eastern Turkestan , Tibet , Nepal , Burma , and Annam . . . . The Manchu period in China was also one of considerable literary activity . Parallel with their European equivalents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story rose to high levels of style and interest , and there were important developments of the Chinese drama . Much fine landscape was painted , colour printing was invented , copper engraving learnt from the Jesuit missionaries , and the manufacture of Chinese porcelain was carried to unexampled heights . But as the eighteenth century wore on the aesthetic quality of this latter product declined through the readiness of the potters to adapt themselves to what they considered to be European taste . There was a steady exportation throughout all this century to the palaces , chateaux and country houses of the European nobility and gentry . European pottery imitated and competed with the Chinese product but never bettered it . The European tea trade also began . We have mentioned a Japanese invasion of China ( or rather // of Korea ) . Except for this aggression upon China , Japan plays no part in our history before the nineteenth century . Like China under the Mings , Japan had set her face resolutely against the interference of foreigners in her affairs . She was a country leading her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have told little of her hitherto because there was little to tell . Her picturesque and romantic history stands apart from the general drama of human affairs . Her population was chiefly a Mongolian population , with some very interesting white people suggestive of a primitive Nordic type , the Hairy Ainu , in the northern . islands . Her civilization seems to have been derived almost entirely from Korea and China ; her art is a special development of Chinese art , her writing an adaptation of the Chinese script . ? 13 In these preceding twelve sections we have been dealing with an age of division , of separated nationalities . We have already described this Period of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as an interregnum in the progress of mankind towards a worldwide unity . Throughout , this period there was no unifying idea in men 's . minds . The impulse of the Empire had failed until the Emperor was no more than one of a number of competing princes . and the dream of Christendom , also , was a fading dream . The developing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a time it seemed that they might jostle one another indefinitely without any great catastrophe to mankind . The great geographical discoveries of the sixteenth century had so enlarged human resources that , for all their divisions , for all the waste of their wars and policies , the people of Europe enjoyed a considerable and increasing prosperity . Central Europe recovered steadily from the devastation of the Thirty Years ' War . Looking back upon this period which came to its climax in the eighteenth century , looking back , as we can begin to do nowadays , and seeing its . events in relation to the centuries that came before it and to the great movements of the present time , we are able to realize how transitory and provisional were its political forms and how unstable its securities . iProvisional it was as no other age has been provisional , an age of assimilation and recuperation , a political pause , a gathering up of the ideas of men and the resources of science for a wider human effort . But the contemporary mind did not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative ideas as // they had been formulated in the Middle Ages , had left human thought for a time destitute of the guidance of creative ideas ; even educated and imaginative men saw the world undramatically ; no longer as an interplay of effort and destiny but as a scene in which a trite happiness was sought and the milder virtues were rewarded . It was not simply the contented and conservative-minded who , in a world of rapid changes , were under the sway of this assurance of an achieved fixity of human conditions . Even highly critical and insurgent intelligences , in default of any sustaining movements in the soul of the community , betrayed the same disposition . Political life , they felt , had ceased to be the urgent and tragic thing it had once been ; it had become a polite comedy . The eighteenth was a century of comedy ? which at the end grew grim . It is inconceivable that that world of the middle eighteenth century could have produced a Jesus of Nazareth , a Gautama , a Francis of Assisi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteenth-century John Huss , it is impossible to imagine anyone with sufficient passion to burn him . Until the stirrings of conscience in Britain that developed into the Methodist revival began , we can detect scarcely a suspicion that there still remained great tasks in hand for our race to do , that enormous disturbances were close at hand , or that the path of man through space and time waa dark with countless dangers , and must to the end remain a high and terrible enterprise . We have quoted again and again in this History from Gibbon 's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire . Now we shall quote from it for the last time and bid it farewell , for we have come to the age in which it was written . Gibbon was born in 1737 , and the last volume of his history was published in 1787 , but the passage we shall quote was probably written in the year 1780 . Gibbon was a young man of delicate health and fairly good fortune ; he had a partial and interrupted education at Oxford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole his outlook was French and cosmopolitan rather than British , and he was much under the intellectual influence of that great Frenchman who is best known under the name of Voltaire ( Francois Marie Arouet de Voltaire , 1694-1778 ) . Voltaire was an author of enormous industry ; seventy volumes of him adorn the present writer 's shelves , and another edition of Voltaire 's works runs to ninety-four ; he dealt largely with history and public affairs , and he corresponded with Catherine the Great of Russia , Frederick the Great of Prussia , Louis XV , and most of the prominent people of the time . Both // Voltaire and Gibbon had the sense of history strong in them ; both have set out ' very plainly and fully their visions of human life and it is clear that to both of them the system in which they lived , the system of monarchy , of leisurely and privileged gentlefolks , of rather despised industrial and trading people and of downtrodden and negligible labourers and - poor and common people , seemed the most stably established way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postured a little as republicans , and sneered at the divine pretensions of monarchy ; but the republicanism that appealed to Voltaire was the crowned republicanism of the Britain of those days , in which the king was simply the official head , the first and greatest of the gentlemen . The ideal they sustained was the ideal of a polite and polished world in which men ? men of quality that is , for no others counted ? would be ashamed to be cruel or gross or enthusiastic , in which the appointments of life would be spacious and elegant , and the fear of ridicule the potent auxiliary of the law in maintaining the decorum and harmonies of life . Voltaire had in him the possibility of a passionate hatred of injustice , and his interventions on behalf of persecuted or ill-used men are the high lights of his long and complicated life-story . And this being the mental disposition of Gibbon and Voltaire , and of the age in which they lived , it is natural that they should find the existence of religion in the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rather unaccountable phenomenon . The whole of that side of life seemed to them -1 kind of craziness in the human make-up , Gibbon 's great history is essentially an attack upon Christianity as the operating cause of the decline and fall . He idealized the crude and gross plutocracy of Rome into a world of fine gentlemen upon the eighteenth-century model , and told how it fell before the Barbarian from without because of the decay through Christianity within . In our history here we have tried to set that story in a better light . To Voltaire official Christianity was " l'infdme " ; something that limited people 's lives , interfered with their thoughts , persecuted harmless dissentients . And , indeed , in that period of the interregnum there was very little life or light in either the orthodox Christianity of Rome or in the orthodox tame churches of Russia and of the Protestant princes . In an interregnum incommoded with an abundance of sleek parsons and sly priests ; t was hard to , realize what fires had once blazed in the heart r , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion might still blaze in the hearts of men . // At the end of his third volume Gibbon completed his account of the breaking-up of the Western Empire . He then raised the question whether civilization might ever undergo again a similar collapse . This led him to review the existing state of affairs ( 1780 ) and to compare it with the state of affairs during the decline of imperial Rome . It will be very convenient to our general design to quote some passages from that comparison here , for nothing could better illustrate the state of mind of the liberal thinkers of Europe at the crest of the political interregnum of the age of the Great Powers before the first intimations of those profound political and social forces of disintegration that have produced at length the dramatic interrogations of our own times . " This awful revolution , " wrote Gibbon of the Western collapse , may be usefully applied to the useful instruction of the present age . It is the duty of a patriot to prefer and promote the exclusive interest and glory of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlarge his views , and to consider Europe as one great republic , whose various inhabitants have attained almost the same level of politeness and cultivation . The balance of power will continue to fluctuate , and the prosperity of our own or the neighbouring kingdoms may be alternately exalted or depressed ; but these partial events can not essentially injure our general state of happiness , the system of arts , and laws and manners , which so advantageously distinguish , above the rest of mankind , the Europeans and their colonies . The savage nations of the globe are the common enemies of civilized society ; and we may inquire with anxious curiosity whether Europe is still threatened with a repetition of those calamities which formerly oppressed the arms and institutions of Rome . Perhaps the same reflections will illustrate the fall of that mighty empire and explain the probable causes of our actual security . " The Romans were ignorant of the extent of their danger , and the number of their enemies . Beyond the Rhine and Danube , the northern countries of Europe and Asia were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , voracious , and turbulent ; bold in arms , and impatient to ravish the fruits of industry . The Barbarian world was agitated by the rapid impulse of war ; and the peace of Gaul or Italy was shaken by the distant revolutions of China . The Huns who fled before a victorious enemy , directed their march towards the west ; and the torrent was swelled by the gradual accession of captives and allies . The flying tribes who yielded to the Huns assumed in their turn the spirit of con // quest ; the endless column of barbarians pressed on the Roman Empire with accumulated weight , and if the foremost were destroyed , the vacant space was instantly replenished by new assailants . Such formidable emigrations can no longer issue from the north ; and the long repose , which has been imputed to the decrease of population , is the happy consequence of the progress of arts and agriculture . Instead of some rude villages , thinly scattered among its woods and morasses , Germany now produces a list of two thousand three hundred walled towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Poland have been successively established ; and the Hansa merchants , with the Teutonic knights , have extended their colonies along the coast of the Baltic , as far as the Gulf of Finland . From the Gulf of Finland to the Eastern Ocean , Russia now assumes the form of a powerful and civilized empire . The plough , the loom , and the forge are introduced on the banks of the Volga , the Oby , and the Lena ; and the fiercest of the Tartar hordes have been taught to tremble and obey ... . " The Empire of Rome was firmly established by the singular and perfect coalition of its members . . . . But this union was purchased by the loss of national freedom and military spirit ; and the servile provinces , destitute of life and motion , expected their safety from the mercenary troops and governors , who were directed by the orders of a distant Court . The happiness of a hundred millions depended on the personal merit of one or two men , perhaps children , whose minds were corrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now divided into twelve powerful , though unequal kingdoms , three respectable commonwealths , and a variety of smaller , though independent , states ; the chances of royal and ministerial talents are multiplied , at least with the number of its rulers ; and a Julian ' . or Semiramis2 may reign in the north , while Arcadius and Honorius3 again slumber on the thrones of the House of Bourbon . The abuses of tyranny are restrained by the mutual influence of fear and shame ; republics have acquired order and stability ; monarchies have imbibed the principles of freedom , or , at least , of moderation ; and some sense of honour and justice is introduced into the most defective constitutions by the general manners of the times . In peace , the progress of knowledge and industry is accelerated by the emulation of so many active rivals ; in war , the European // forces are exercised by temperate and undecisive contests . If a savage conqueror should issue from the deserts of Tartary , he must repeatedly vanquish the robust peasants of Russia , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the intrepid freemen of Britain ; who , perhaps , might confederate for their common defence . Should the victorious Barbarians carry slavery and desolation as far as the Atlantic Ocean , ten thousand vessels would transport beyond their pursuit the remains of civilized society ; and Europe would revive and flourish in the American world which is already filled with her colonies and institutions . " Cold , poverty , and a life of danger and fatigue fortify the strength and courage of Barbarians . In every age they have oppressed the polite and peaceful nations of China , India and Persia , who neglected , and still neglect to counterbalance these natural powers by the resources of military art . The warlike states of antiquity , Greece , Macedonia , and Rome , educated a race of soldiers ; exercised their bodies , disciplined their courage , multiplied their forces by regular evolutions , and converted the iron which they possessed into strong and serviceable weapons . But this superiority insensibly declined with their laws and manners ; and the feeble policy of Constantine and his successors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rude valour of the Barbarian mercenaries . The military art has been changed by the invention of gunpowder ; which enables man to command the two most powerful agents of nature , air and fire . Mathematics , chemistry , mechanics , architecture , have been applied to the service of war ; and the adverse parties oppose to each other the most elaborate modes of attack and of defense . Historians may indignantly observe that the preparations of a seige would found and maintain a flourishing colony ; yet we can not he displeased that the subversion of a city should be a work of cost and difficulty , or that an industrious people should be protected by those arts , which survive and supply the decay of military virtue . Cannon and fortifications now form an impregnable barrier against the Tartar horse ; and Europe is secure from any future irruption of Barbarians ; since , before they can conquer , they must cease to be barbarous . . . . " Should these speculations be found doubtful or fallacicus , there still remains a more humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and modern navigators , and the domestic history , or tradition , of the most enlightened nations , represer // the human savage , naked both iri mind and body , and destitute of laws , of arts , of ideas , and almost of language . From this abject condition , perhaps the primitive and universal state of man , he has gradually risen . to command the animals , to fertilize the earth , to traverse the ocean , and to measure the heavens . His progress in the improvement and exercise of his mental and corporeal faculties has been irregular and various , infinitely slow in the beginning , and increasing by degrees with redoubled velocity ; ages of laborious ascent have been followed by a moment of rapid downfall ; and the several climates of the globe have felt the vicissitudes of light and darkness . Yet the experience of four thousand years should enlarge our hopes , and diminish our apprehensions ; we can not determine to what height the human species may aspire in their advances towards perfection ; but it may safely be presumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed , will relapse into their original barbarism . " Since the first discovery of the arts , war , commerce , and religious zeal have diffused among the savages of the Old and New World those inestimal1c gifts , they have been successively propagated ; they can never be lost . We may therefore acquiesce in the pleasing conclusion that every age of the world has increased , and still increases , the real wealth , the happiness , the knowledge , and perhaps the virtue , of the human race . " ? 14 One of the most interesting aspects of this story of Europe in the seventeenth and earlier eighteenth century , during the phase of the Grand and Parliamentary Monarchies , is the comparative quiescence of the peasants and workers . The insurrectionary fires of the fourteenth and fifteenth and sixteenth centuries seem to have died down . The acute economic clashes of the earlier period had been mitigated by rough adjustments . The discovery of America had revolutionized and changed the scale of business and industry , had brought a vast volume of precious metal fot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a time life and work ceased to be intolerable to the masses of the poor . This did not , of course , prevent much individual misery and discontent ; the poor we have always had with us , but this misery and discontent was divided and scattered . It became inaudible . In the earlier period the common people had had an idea to crystallize upon , the idea of Christian . communism . Tl1ey had it // found an educated leadership in the dissentient priests and doctors of the Wycliffe type . As the movement for a revival in Christianity spent its force , as Lutheranism fell back for leadership from Jesus upon the Protestant Princes , this contact and reaction of the fresher minds of the educated class upon the illiterate mass was interrupted . However numerous a downtrodden class may be , and however extreme its miseries , it will never be able to male an effective protest until it achieves solidarity by the development of some common general idea . Educated men and women of ideas arc more necessary to a popular political movement than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruling , and an oligarchy of any type has the education of affairs ; but the common man , the peasant or toiler , has no experience in large matters , and can exist politically only through the services , devotion , and guidance of educated men . The Reformation , the Reformation that succeeded , the Reformation that is of the Princes , by breaking up educational facilities , largely destroyed the poor scholar and priest class whose persuasion of the crowd had rendered the Reformation possible . The Princes of the Protestant countries when they seized upon the national churches early apprehended the necessity , of gripping the universities also . Their idea of education was the idea of capturing young clever people for the service of their betters . Beyond that they were disposed to regard education as a mischievous thing . The only way to an education , therefore , for a poor man was through patronage . Of course , there was a parade of encouragement towards learning in all the Grand Monarchies , a setting up of Academies and Royal . Societies , but these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church also had learnt to distrust the educated poor man . In the great aristocratic " crowned republic " of Britain there was the same shrinkage of educational opportunity . " Both the ancient universities , " says Hammond , in his account of the eighteenth century , " were the universities of the rich . There is a passage in Macaulay describing the state and pomp of Oxford at the end of the seventeenth century , when her Chancellor , the venerable Duke of Ormonde , sat in his embroidered mantle on+his throne under the painted ceiling of the Sheldonian theatre , surrounded by hundreds of graduates robed according to their rank , while the noblest youths of England were solemnly presented to him as candidates for academical honours . ' The university was a power , not in the sense in which that could be said of a university like the old university of Paris , whose // learning could make Popes tremble , but in the sense that the university was part of the recognized machinery of aristocracy . What was true of the universities was true of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not of a society , but of an order ; not of a State , but of a race of owner-rulers . " The missionary spirit had departed from education throughout Europe . To that , quite as much as to the amelioration of things by a diffused prosperity , this phase of quiescence among the lower classes is to be ascribed . They had lost brains and speech , and they were fed . The community was like a pithed animal in the hands of the governing class . Moreover , there had been considerable changes in the proportions of class to class . One of the most difficult things for the historian to trace is the relative amount of the total property of the community held at any time by any particular class in that community . These things fluctuate very rapidly . The peasant wars of Europe indicate a phase of comparatively concentrated property when large masses of people could feel themselves expropriated and at a common disadvantage , and so take mass action This was the time of the rise and prosperity of the Fuggers and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast importation of silver and gold and commodities into Europe from America , there seems to have been a restoration of a more diffused state of wealth . The poor were just as miserable as ever , but there were perhaps not so many poor relatively , and they were broken up into a variety of types without any ideas in common . In Great Britain the agricultural life which had been dislocated by the confiscations of the Reformation had settled down again into a system of tenant farming under great landowners . Side by side with the large estates there was still , however , much common land for pasturing the beasts of the poorer villagers , and much land cultivated in strips upon communal lines . The middling sort of man , and even the poorer sort of man upon the land , were leading an endurable existence in 1700 . The standard of life , the idea , that is , of what is an endurable existence , was , however , rising during the opening phase of Grand Monarchy ; after a time the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large landowners began to acquire and crowd out the poorer free cultivators , and the proportion of poor people and of people who felt they were leading impoverished lives increased again . The bigger men were unchallenged rulers of Great Britain , and they set themselves to enact laws , the Enclosure Acts , that // practically confiscated the unenclosed and common lands , mainly for the benefit of the larger landowners . The smaller men sank to the level of wage workers upon the land over which they had once possessed right of cultivation and pasture . The peasant in France and upon the Continent generally was not so expropriated ; his enemy was not the landlord , but the taxgatherer ; he was squeezed on his land instead of being squeezed off it . As the eighteenth century progressed , it is apparent in the literature of the time that what to do with " the poor " was again exercising men 's thoughts . We find such active-minded English writers as Defoe ( 1659 ? 1731 ) and Fielding ( 1707 ? 54 ) deeply exercised by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revival of the communistic and equalitarian ideas of primitive Christianity as distinguished the time of Wycliffe and John Huss . Protestantism in breaking up the universal church had for a time broken up the idea of a universal solidarity . Even if the universal church of the Middle Ages had failed altogether to realize that idea , it had at any rate been the symbol of that idea . Defoe and Fielding were men of a livelier practical imagination than Gibbon , and they realized something of the economic processes that were afoot in their time . So did Oliver Goldsmith ( 1728 ? 74 ) ; his Deserted Village ( 1770 ) is a pamphlet on enclosures disguised as a poem . But Gibbon 's circumstances had never brought economic facts very vividly before his eyes ; he saw the world as a struggle between barbarism and civilization , but he perceived nothing of that other struggle over which he floated , the mute , unconscious struggle of the commonalty against able , ' powerful , rich , and selfish men . He did not perceive the accumulation of stresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance of his " twelve powerful , though unequal , kingdoms , " his " three respectable commonwealths , " and their rag , tag , and bobtail of independent minor princes , reigning dukes , and so forth . Even the civil war that had begun in the British colonies in America did not arouse him to the nearness of what we now call " Democracy . " From what we have been saying hitherto , the reader may suppose that the squeezing of the small farmer and the peasant off the land by the great landowners , the mere grabbing of commons and the concentration of property in the hands of a powerful privileged and greedy class , was all that was happening to the English land in the eighteenth century . So we do but state the // worse side of the change . Concurrently with this change of ownership there was going on a great improvement in agriculture . There can be little doubt that the methods of cultivation pursued by the peasants , squatters , and small farmers were antiquated , wasteful , and comparatively unproductive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Enclosure Acts were much more productive ( one authority says twenty times more productive ) than the old ways . The change was perhaps a necessary one , and the evil of it was not that it was brought about , but that it was brought about so as to increase both wealth and the numbers of the poor . Its benefits were intercepted by the bigger private owners . The community was injured to . the great profit of this class . And here we come upon one of the chief problems of our lives at the present time , the problem of the deflection of the profits of progress . For two hundred years there has been , mainly under the influence of the spirit of science and inquiry , a steady improvement in the methods of production of almost everything that humanity requires . If our sense of community and our social science were equal to the tasks required of them , there can be little question that this great increment in production would have benefited the whole community , would have given everyone an amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never dreamt of before . But though the common standard of living has risen , the rise has been on a scale disproportionately small . The rich have developed a freedom and luxury unknown in the world hitherto , and there has been an , increase in the proportion of rich people and stagnantly prosperous and unproductive people in the community ; but that also fails to account for the full benefit . There has been much sheer waste . Vast accumulations of material and energy have gone into warlike preparations and warfare . Much has been devoted to the futile efforts of unsuccessful business competition . Huge possibilities have remained undeveloped because of the opposition of owners , forestallers , and speculators to their economical exploitation . The good things that science and organization have been bringing within the reach of mankind have not been taken methodically and used to their utmost , but they have been scrambled for , snatched at , seized upon by gambling adventurers and employed upon selfish and vain ends . The eighteenth century in Europe , and more particularly in Great Britain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Private enterprise , " which meant in practice that everyone was entitled to get everything he could out of the business of the community , reigned supreme . No sense of // obligation to the state in business matters is to be found in the ordinary novels , plays , and such-like representative literature of the time . Everyone is out " to make his fortune , " there is no recognition that it is wrong to be an unproductive parasite on the community , and still less that a financier or merchant or manufacturer can ever be overpaid for his services to mankind . This was the moral atmosphere of the time , and those lords and gentlemen who grabbed the people 's commons , assumed possession of the mines under their lands , and crushed down the yeoman farmers and peasants to the status of pauper labourers , had no idea that they were living anything but highly meritorious lives . Concurrently with this change in Great Britain from traditional patch agriculture and common pasture to large and more scientific agriculture , very great changes were going on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , in the eighteenth century , leading the world . Hitherto , throughout the whole course of history from the beginnings of civilization , manufactures , building , and industries generally had been in the hands of craftsmen and small masters who worked in their own houses . They had been organized in guilds , and were mostly their own employers . They formed an essential and permanent middle class , There were capitalists among them , who let out looms and the like , supplied material , and took the finished product , but they were not big capitalists . There had been no rich manufacturers . The rich men of the world before this time had been great landowners or money-lenders and money manipulators or merchants . But in the eighteenth century , workers in certain industries began to be collected together into factories in order to produce things in larger quantities through a systematic division of labour , and the employer , as distinguished from the master worker , began to be a person of importance . Moreover , mechanical invention was producing machines that simplified the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven by water-power and presently by steam . In 1765 Watt 's steam engine was constructed , a very important date in the history of industrialism . The cotton industry was one of the first to pass into factory production ( originally with , water-driven machinery ) . The woollen industry followed . At the same time iron smelting , which had been restrained hitherto to small methods by the use of charcoal , resorted to coke made from coal , and the coal and iron industries also began to expand . The iron industry shifted from the wooded country of Sussex and Surrey to the coal districts . By 1800 this PRINCES , PARLIAMENTS AND POWERS change-over of industry from a small scale business with small employers to a large scale production under big employers was well in progress . Everywhere there sprang up factories using first water , then steam power . It was a change of fundamental importance in , human economy . From the dawn of history the manufacture and craftsman had been , as we have said , a sort of middleclass townsman . The machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either became an employer of his fellows , and grew towards wealth and equality with the other rich classes , or he remained a worker and sank very rapidly to the level of a mere labourer . This great change in human affairs is known as the Industrial Revolution . Beginning in Great Britain , it spread during the nineteenth century throughout the world . As the Industrial Revolution went on , a great gulf opened between employer and employed . In the past every manufacturing worker had the hope of becoming an independent master . Even the slave craftsmen of Babylon and Rome were protected by laws that enabled them to save and buy their freedom and to set up for themselves . But now a factory and its engines and machines became a vast and costly thing measured by the scale of the worker 's pocket . Wealthy men had to come together to create an enterprise ; credit and plant , that is to-say , " Capital , " were required . " Setting up for oneself " ceased to be a normal hope for an artisan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grave . Besides the landlords and merchants and the money dealers who financed trading companies and lent their money to the merchants and the State , there arose now this new wealth of industrial capital ? a new sort of power in the State . Of the working out of these beginnings we shall tell later . The immediate effect of the Industrial Revolution upon the countries to which it came , was to cause a vast , distressful shifting and stirring of the mute , uneducated , leaderless , and now more and more propertyless common population . The small cultivators and peasants , ruined and dislodged by the Enclosure Acts , drifted towards the new Manufacturing regions , and there they joined the families of the impoverished and degraded craftsmen in the factories . Great towns of squalid houses came into existence . Nobody seems to have noted clearly what was going on at the time . It is the keynote of " private enterprise " to mind one 's own business , secure the utmost profit and disregard any other consequences . Ugly factories grew up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma866 THE OUTLINE OF HISTORY chines and workers as possible . Around them gathered the streets of workers ' homes , built at the cheapest rate , without space , without privacy , barely decent , and let at the utmost rent that could be exacted . These new industrial centres were at first without schools , without churches . ... The English gentleman of the closing decades of the eighteenth century read Gibbon 's third volume and congratulated himself that there was henceforth no serious fear of the Barbarians , with this new barbarism growing up , with this metamorphosis of his countrymen into something dark and desperate , in full progress , within an easy walk , perhaps , of ' his door .

We have told how the struggles of the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century princes for ascendancies and advantages developed into a more cunning and complicated struggle of foreign offices , masquerading as idealized " Great Powers , " as the eighteenth century wore on . The intricate and pretentious art of diplomacy . developed . The " Prince " ceased to be a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbol of a Machiavellian scheme . Prussia , Russia , - and Austria fell upon and divided Poland . France was baffled in profound schemes against Spain . Britain circumvented the " designs of France " and America and acquired Canada , and got the better of France in India . And then a remarkable thing occurred , a thing very shocking to European diplomacy . The British Colonies in America flatly refused to have any further // part or lot in this game of " Great Powers . " They objected that they had no voice and no great interest in these European schemes and conflicts , and they refused to bear any portion of the burthen of taxation these ' foreign policies entailed . " Taxation without representation is tyranny " ? this was their dominant idea . Of course , this decision to separate did not flash out complete and finished from the American mind at the beginning of these troubles . In America in the eighteenth century , just as in England in the seventeenth , there was an entire willingness , indeed a desire on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of the king and his ministers . But there was an equally strong desire on the part of ordinary men to be neither taxed nor interfered with in their ordinary pursuits . These are incompatible wishes . Common men can not shirk world-politics and at the same time enjoy private freedom ; but it has taken them countless generations to learn this . The first impulse in the American revolt against the government in Great Britain was , therefore , simply a resentment against the taxation and interference that followed necessarily from " foreign policy , " without any clear recognition of what was involved in that objection . It was only when the revolt was consummated that the people of the American colonies recognized at all clearly that they had repudiated the Great Power view of life . The sentence in which that repudiation was expressed was Washington 's injunction to " avoid entangling alliances .

When at length , in 1917 , they were obliged to re-enter the arena of world politics , it was to bring into the tangle of international relationships the new spirit and new aims their aloofness had enabled them to develop . They were not , however , the first to stand aloof . Since the Treaty of Westphalia ( 1648 ) the confederated states of Switzerland , in their mountain fastnesses , had sustained their right to exclusion from the schemes of kings and empires .

The darker shading represents the districts settled in 1700 , the lighter the growth of the settlements up to 1760 . It will be seen that the colonies were a mere ? fringe of population along the coast , spreadiig gradually inland and finding in the Alleghany and Blue Mountains a very serious barrier . Among the oldest of these settlements was - the colony of Virginia , the name of which commemorates Queen Elinbeth , the Virgin Queen of England . The first expedition to found a colony in Virginia was made by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1584 , but there was no permanent settlement at that time , and the real beginnings of Virginia date from the foundation of the Virginia Company in 1606 , in the reign of James I ( 1603-1625 ) . The story of John Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian " princess " Pocahontas married one of his gentlemen , is an English classic.l In growing tobacco the Virginians found the beginning of prosperity . At the same time that the Virginian Company was founded , the Plymouth Company obtained a charter for the settlement of the country to the north of Long Island Sound , to which the English laid claim . But it was only in 1620 that the northern region began to be settled , and that under fresh charters . The settlers of the northern region ( New England ) , which became Connecticut , New Hampshire , Rhode Island , and Massachusetts , were men of a different stamp to the Virginian people ; they were Protestants discontented with the Anglican Church compromise , and republican-spirited men hopeless of resistance to the Grand Monarchy of James I and Charles I. Their pioneer ship was the Mayflower , which founded New Plymouth in 1620 . The dominant northern colony was Massachusetts . Differences in religious methods and // Massachusetts . It illustrates the scale upon which things were done in those days that the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain Captain John Mason , and that he offered to sell it to the king ( King Charles II , in 1671 ) in exchange for the right to import 300 tons of French wine free of duty ? an offer which was refused . The present state of Maine was bought by Massachusetts from its alleged owner for twelve hundred and fifty pounds . In the Civil War that ended with the decapitation of Charles I the sympathies of New England were for the Parliament , and Virginia was Cavalier ; but two hundred and fifty miles separated these settlements , and there were no serious hostilities . With the return of the monarchy in 1660 , there was a vigorous development of British colonization in America . Charles II and his associates were greedy for gain , and the British crown had no wish to make any further experiments in illegal taxation at home . But the undefined relations of the colonies to the crown and the British government seemed to afford promise of financial adventure across the Atlantic . There was a rapid development of plantations and proprietary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a colony that was to be a home of religious freedom for Catholics under the attractive name of Maryland , to the north and east of Virginia ; and now the Quaker Penn ( whose father had rendered valuable service to Charles II ) established himself to the north of Philadelphia and , founded the colony of Pennsylvania . Its main boundary with Maryland and Virginia was delimited by two men , Mason and Dixon , whose " Mason and Dixon 's line " was destined to become a very important line indeed in the later affairs of the United States . Carolina , which was originally an unsuccessful French Protestant establishment and which owed its name not to Charles ( Carolus ) II of England , but to Charles IX of France , had fallen into English hands and was settled at several points . Between Maryland and New England stretched a number of small Dutch and Swedish settlements , of which the chief town was New Amsterdam . These settlements were captured from the Dutch by the British in 1664 , lost again in 1673 , and restored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thereby the whole coast from Maine to Carolina became in some form or other a British possession . To the south the Spanish were established ; their headquarters were at Fort St. Augustine in Florida , and in 1733 the town of Savannah was settled by a philanthropist OgleREPUBLICS // thorpe from England , who had taken pity on the miserable people imprisoned for debt in England , and rescued a number of them from prison to become the founders of a new colony , Georgia , which was to be a bulwark against the Spanish . So by the middle of the eighteenth century we have these settlements along the American coastline : the New England group of Puritans and free Protestants ? Maine ( belonging to Massachusetts ) , New Hampshire , Connecticut , Rhode Island , and Massachusetts ; the captured Dutch group , which was now , divided up into New York ( New Amsterdam rechristened ) , New Jersey , and Delaware ( Swedish before it was Dutch , and in its earliest British phase attached to Pennsylvania ) ; then came Catholic Maryland ; Cavalier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and South ) and Oglethorpe 's Georgia . Later on , a number of Tyrolese Protestants took refuge , in Georgia , and there was a considerable immigration of a good class of German cultivators into Pennsylvania . Such were the miscellaneous origins of the citizens of the Thirteen Colonies . The possibility of their ever becoming closely united would have struck an impartial observer in 1760 as being very slight . Superadded to the initial differences of origin , fresh differences were created by climate . North of the Mason and Dixon line , farming was practised mainly upon British or Central European lines by free white cultivators . The settled country of New England took on a likeness to the English countryside ; considerable areas of Pennsylvania developed fields and farmhouses like those of South Germany . The distinctive conditions in the north had , socially , important effects . Masters and men had to labour together as backwoodsmen , and were equalized in the process . They did not start equally ; many " servants " are mentioned in the roster of the Mayflower . But they rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , . a vast tract of land to be had for the taking , and the " servant " went off and took land like his master . The English class system disappeared . Under colonial conditions there arose equality " in the faculties both of body and mind , " and an individual independence of judgment impatient of interference from England . But south of the Mason and Dixon line tobacco-growing began , and the warmer climate encouraged the establishment of plantations with gang labour . Red Indian captives were tried but found to be too homicidal ; Cromwell sent Irish prisoners of war to Virginia , which did much to reconcile the Royalist planters to republican872 THE OUTLINE OF HISTORY ism ; convicts were sent out , and there was a considerable trade in kidnapped children , who were " spirited away " to America to become apprentices or bond slaves . But the most convenient form of gang labour proved to be that of negro slaves . The first negro slaves were brought to Jamestown in Virginia by a Dutch ship as early as 1620 . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Virginia , Maryland , and the Carolinas were their chief regions of employment , and while the communities to the north were communities of not very rich and not very poor farming men , the south developed a type of large proprietor and a white community of overseers and professional men subsisting on slave labour . Slave labour was a necessity to the social and economic system that had grown up in the south ; in the north the presence of slaves was unnecessary and in some respects inconvenient . Conscientious scruples about slavery were more free , therefore , to develop and flourish in the northern atmosphere . To this question of the revival of slavery in the world we must return when we come to consider the perplexities of American Democracy . Here we note it simply as an added factor in the heterogeneous mixture of the British Colonies . But if the inhabitants of the Thirteen Colonies were miscellaneous in their origins and various in their habits and sympathies , they had three very strong antagonisms in common . They had a common interest against the Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of French conquest and dominion . And thirdly , they were all in conflict with the claims of the British crown and the commercial selfishness of the narrow oligarchy who dominated the British Parliament and British affairs . So far as the first danger went , the Indians were a constant evil but never more than a threat of disaster . They remained divided against themselves . Yet they had shown possibilities of combination upon a larger scale . The five nations of the Iroquois ( see map of 1760 colonies ) were a very important league of tribes . But it never succeeded in playing off the French against the English to secure itself , and no Red Indian Jengis Khan ever arose among these nomads of the New World . The French aggression was a more serious threat . The French never made settlements in America on a scale to compete with the English , but their government set about the encirclement of the colonies and their subjugation in a terrifying systematic manner . The English in America were colonists ; the French were explorers , adventurers , agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Canada did they strike root . French statesmen sat over maps and dreamt dreams , and their dreams are to be seen in our map , in the chain of forts creeping southward from the Great Lakesand northward up the Mississippi and Ohio rivers . The struggle of France and Britain was a world-wide struggle . It was decided in India , in Germany , and on the high seas . In the Peace of Paris ( 1763 ) the French gave England Canada , and relinquished Louisiana to the inert hands of declining Spain . It was the complete abandonment of America by France . The lifting of the // French danger left the colonists unencumbered to face their third common antagonist ? the crown and government of their motherland. ? 3 We have noted in the previous chapter how the governing class of Great Britain steadily acquired the land and destroyed the liberty of the common people throughout the eighteenth century , and how greedily and blindly the new industrial revolution was brought about . We have noted also how the British Parliament , through the decay of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become both in its upper and lower houses merely the instrument of government through the big landowners . Both these big property-holders and the crown were deeply interested in America ? the former as private adventurers , the latter partly as representing the speculative exploitations of the Stuart kings , and partly as representing the State in search of funds for the expenses of foreign policy ; and neither lords nor crown were disposed to regard the traders , planters , and common people of the colonies with any more consideration than they did the yeomen and small cultivators at home . At bottom the interests of the common man in Great Britain , Ireland , and America were the same . Each was being squeezed by the same system . But while in Britain oppressor and oppressed were closely tangled tip in one intimate social system , in America the crown and the exploiter were far away , and men could get together and develop a sense of community against their common enemy . Moreover , the American colonist had the important advantage of possessing a separate and legal organ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislature of his colony that was necessary for the management of local affairs . The common man in Britain , cheated out of his proper representation in the Commons , had no organ , no centre of expression and action for his discontents . It will be evident to the reader , bearing in mind the variety of the colonies , that here was the possibility of an endless series of disputes , aggressions and counter-aggressions . The story of the development of irritations between the colonies and Britain is a story far too intricate , subtle , and lengthy for the scheme of this Outline . Suffice it that the grievances fell under three main heads : attempts to secure for British adventurers or the British government the profits of the exploitation of new lands ; // systematic restrictions upon trade designed to keep the foreign trade of the colonies entirely in British hands , so that the colonial exports all went through Britain and only British-made goods were used in America ; and finally , attempts at taxation through the British Parliament as the supreme taxing authority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of annoyances the American colonists were forced to do a very considerable amount of hard political thinking . Such men as Patrick Henry and James Otis began to discuss the fundamental ideas of government and political association very much as they had been discussed in England in the great days of Cromwell 's Commonwealth . They began to deny both the divine origin of kingship and the supremacy of the British Parliament , and ( James Otis , 1762 ) to say such things as s " God made all men naturally equal . " Ideas of earthly superiority are educational , not innate . " Kings , were made for the good of the people , and not the people for them . " No government has a right to make slaves of its subjects . " Though most governments are de facto arbitrary , and consequently the curse and scandal of human nature , yet none are de jure arbitrary . " Some of which propositions reach far . This ferment in the political ideas of the Americans was started by English leaven . One very influential English writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Civil Government may be taken , as much as one single book can be taken in such cases , as the point of departure for modern democratic ideas . He was the son of a Cromwellian soldier , he was educated at Christ Church , Oxford , during the republican ascendancy , he spent some years in Holland in exile , and his writings form a bridge between the bold political thinking of those earlier republican days and the revolutionary movement both in America and France . But men do not begin to act upon theories . It is always some real danger , some practical necessity , that produces action ; and it is only after action has destroyed old relationships and produced a new and perplexing state of affairs that theory comes to its own . Then it is that theory is put to the test . The discord in interests and ideas between the colonists was brought to a A // fighting issue by the obstinate resolve of the British Parliament after the peace of 1763 to impose taxation upon the American colonies . Britain was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity for settling accounts with these recalcitrant settlers . But the great British property-owners found a power beside their own , of much the same mind with them , but a little divergent in its ends ? the reviving crown . King George III , who had begun his reign in 1760 , was resolved to be much more of a king than his two German predecessors . He could speak English ; he claimed to " glory in the name of Briton " ? and , indeed , it is not a bad name for a man without a perceptible drop of English , Welsh , or Scotch blood in his veins . In the American colonies and the overseas possessions generally , with their indefinite charters or no charters at all , it seemed to him that the crown might claim authority and obtain resources and powers absolutely denied to it by the strong and jealous aristocracy in Britain . This inclined many of the Whig noblemen to a sympathy with the colonists that they might not otherwise have shown . They had no objection to the exploitation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but they had very strong objections to the strengthening of the crown by that exploitation so as to make it presently independent of themselves . The war that broke out was , therefore , in reality not a war between Britain and the colonists , it was a war between the British government and the colonists , with a body of Whig noble men and a considerable amount of public feeling in England on the side of the latter . An early move after 1763 was , an attempt to raise revenue for Britain in the colonies by requiring that newspapers and documents of various sorts should be stamped . This was stiffly resisted , the British crown was intimidated , and the Stamp Acts were repealed ( 1766 ) . Their repeal was greeted by riotous rejoicings in London , more hearty even than those in the colonies . But the Stamp Act affair was only one eddy in a turbulent stream flowing towards civil war . Upon a score of pretexts , and up and down the coast , the representatives of the British government were busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quartering of soldiers upon the colonists was a great nuisance . Rhode Island was particularly active in defying the trade restrictions . The Rhode Islanders were " free traders " ? that is to say , smugglers ; a government schooner , // the Gas1ee , ran aground off Providence ; she was surprised , boarded , and captured by armed men in boats , and burnt . In 1773 , with a total disregard of the existing colonial tea trade , special advantages for the importation of tea into America were given by the British Parliament to the East India Company . It was resolved by the colonists to . refuse and boycott this tea . When the tea importers at Boston showed themselves resolute to land their cargoes , a band of men disguised as Indians , in the presence of a great crowd of people , boarded the three tea ships and threw the tea overboard ( December 16th , 1773 ) . n either side for the coming conflict . It was decided by the British Parliament in the spring of 1774 to punish Boston by closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she accepted that ea . It was a quite typical instance of that silly " firmness " whit shatters empires . In order to enforce this measure , British troops were concentrated at Boston under General Gage . The colonists took counter-measures . The first colonial congress met at Philadelphia in September , at which twelve colonies were represented : Massachusetts , Connecticut , New Hampshire , Rhode Island , New York , New jersey , Pennsylvania , Maryland , Delaware , Virginia , and North and South Carolina . Georgia was not . present . True to the best English traditions , the congress documented its attitude by a " Declaration of Rights . " Practically this congress was an insurrectionary government , but no blow was struck until the spring of 1775 . Then came the first shedding of blood . . 1t4. 0 5 // Two of the American leaders , Hancock and Samuel Adams , had been marked down by the British government for arrest and trial for . treason ; they were known to be at Lexington , about eleven miles from Boston ; and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forces in motion for their arrest . That night was a momentous one in history . The movement of . Gage 's troops had been observed , signal lanterns were shown from a church tower in Boston , and two men , Dawes and Paul Revere , stole away in boats across the Back Bay to take horse and warn the country-side . The British were also ferried over the water , and as they marched through the night towards Lexington the firing of signal cannon and the ringing of church bells went before them . As they entered Lexington at dawn , they saw a little company of men drawn up in military fashion . It seems that the British fired first . There was a single shot and then a volley , and the little handful decamped , apparently without any answering shots , leaving eight dead and nine wounded upon the village green . The British then marched on to Concord , ten miles further , occupied the village , and stationed a party on the bridge at that place . The expedition had failed in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commander seems to have been at a loss what to do next . Meanwhile the colonial levies were coming up from all directions , and presently the picket upon the bridge found itself subjected to an increasing fire and finally to an assault . A retreat to Boston was decided upon . It was a disastrous retreat . The country had risen behind ; all the morning the colonials had been gathering . Both sides ofthe road were now swarming with sharpshooters firing from behind rock and fence and building , while occasionally they pressed up to bayonet distance . The soldiers were in conspicuous scarlet uniforms , with yellow facings and white gaiters and cravats ; these must have stood out very vividly against the cold sharp colours of the late New England spring ; the day was bright , hot , and dusty , and the men were already exhausted by a night march . Every few yards a man fell , wounded or killed . The rest tramped on , or halted to fire an ineffectual volley . At Lexington there were British reinforcements and two guns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better order . But the pursuit was pressed to the river , and after the British had crossed back into Boston , the colonial levies took up their quarters in Cambridge and prepared to blockade the city . // ? 4 So the war began . It was not a war that promised a conclusive end . The colonists had no one vulnerable capital ; they were dispersed over a great country with a limitless wilderness behind it , and so they had great powers of resistance . They had learnt their tactics largely from the Indians ; they could fight well in open order , and harry and destroy troops in movement . But they had no disciplined army that could-meet the British in a pitched battle , and little military equipment ; and their levies grew impatient at a long campaign , and tended to go home to their farms . The British , on the other hand , had a well-drilled army , and their command of the sea gave them the power of shifting their attack up and down the long Atlantic seaboard . They were at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid and greedy to interfere in the conduct of affairs ; the generals he favoured were stupid " strong men " or flighty men of birth and fashion , and the heart - of England was not in the business . He trusted rather to being able to blockade , raid and annoy the colonists into submission than to a conclusive conquest and occupation of the land . But the methods employed , and particularly the use of hired German troops , who still retained the cruel traditions of the Thirty Years ' War , and of Indian auxiliaries , who harried the outlying settlers , did not so much weary the Americans of the war as of the British . The Congress , meeting for the second time in 1775 , endorsed the actions of the New England colonists , and appointed George Washington the American commander-in-chief . In 1777 General Burgoyne , in an attempt to get down to New York from Canada , was defeated- at Freeman 's Farm on the Upper Hudson , and surrounded and obliged to capitulate at Saratoga with his whole army . This disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the side of the colonists . The French fleet did much to minimize the advantage of the British at sea . General Cornwallis was caught in the Yorktown peninsula in Virginia in 1781 , and capitulated with his army . The British government , now heavily engaged with France and Spain in Europe , was at the end of its resources . At the outset of the war the colonists in general seem to have been as little disposed to repudiate monarchy and claim complete independence as were the Hollanders in the opening phase of Philip II 's persecutions and follies . The separatists were called // radicals ; they were mostly extremely democratic , as we should say in England to-day , and their advanced views frightened many of the steadier and wealthier colonists , for whom class privileges and distinctions had considerable charm . But early in 1776 , an able and persuasive Englishman , Thomas Paine , published a pamphlet at Philadelphia with the title of Common Sense , which had an enormous effect on public opinion . Its style was rhetorical by modern standards . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature cries , " T is time to part , ' " and so forth . But its effects were very great . It converted thousands to the necessity of separation . The turn-over of opinion , once it had begun , was rapid . Only in the summer of 1776 did Congress take the irrevocable step of declaring for separation . " The Declaration of Independence , " another of those exemplary documents which it has been the peculiar service of the English to produce for mankind , was drawn up by Thomas Jefferson ; and after various amendments and modifications it was made the fundamental document of the United States of America . There were two noteworthy amendments to Jefferson 's draft . He had denounced the slave trade fiercely , and blamed the home government for interfering with colonial attempts to end it . This was thrown out , and so , too , was a sentence about the British : " we must endeavour to forget our former love for them . . . we might have been a free and a great people together . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty in which Britain recognized the complete independence of the United States were signed at Paris . The end of the war was proclaimed on April 19th , 1783 , exactly eight years after Paul Revere 's ride and the retreat of Gage 's men from Concord to Boston . The Treaty of Peace was finally signed at Paris in September . ? 5 From the point of view of human history , the way in which the Thirteen States became independent is of far less importance than the fact that they did become independent . And with the establishment of their independence came a new sort of community into the world . It was like something coming out of an egg . It was a Western European civilization that had broken free from the last traces of Empire and Christendom ; and it had not a vestige of monarchy left and no State religion . It had // no dukes , princes , counts , nor any sort of title-hearers claiming to ascendancy or respect as a right . Even its unity was as yet a mere unity for defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean start in political organization as the world had not seen before . The absence of any binding religious tie is especially noteworthy . It had a number of forms of Christianity , its spirit was indubitably Christian ; but , as a State document of 1796 explicitly declared , " The government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion . " l The new community had , in fact , gone right down to the bare and stripped fundamentals of human association , and it was building up a new sort of society and a new sort of state upon those foundations . Here were about four million people scattered over a vast area with very slow and difficult means of intercommunication , poor as yet , but with the potentiality of limitless wealth , setting out to do in reality on a huge scale such a feat of construction as the Athenian philosophers twenty-two centuries before had done in imagination and theory . This situation marks a definite stage in the release of man from precedent and usage , and a definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances to suit his needs and aims . It was a new method becoming practical in human affairs . The modern states of Europe have been evolved , institution by institution , slowly and planlessly out of preceding things . The United States were planned and made . In one respect , however , the creative freedom of the new nation was very seriously restricted . This new sort of community and state was not built upon a cleared site . It was not even so frankly an artificiality as some of the later Athenian colonies which went out from the mother-city to plan and build brandnew city states with brand-new constitutions . The thirteen colonies by the end of the war had all of them constitutions either , like that of Connecticut and Rhode Island , dating from their original charters ( 1662 ) or , as in the case of the rest of the states , where a British governor had played a large part in the administration , re-made during the conflict . But we may well consider these reconstructions as contributory essays and experiments in the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very prominently . One is the idea of political and social equality . This idea , which we // saw coming into the world as an extreme and almost incredible idea in the age between Buddha and Jesus of Nazareth , is now asserted in the later eighteenth century as a practical standard of human relationship . Says the fundamental statement of Virginia : " All men are by nature equally free and independent , " and it proceeds to rehearse their " rights , " and to assert that all magistrates and governors are but " trustees and servants " of the commonweal . All men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion . The king by right , the aristocrat , the " natural slave , " the god-king , and the god have all vanished from this political scheme ? so far as these declarations go . Most of the states produced similar preludes to government . The Declaration of Independence said that " all men are born equal . " It is everywhere asserted in eighteenth-century terms that the new community is to be ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter ? a community of will and not a community of obedience . But the thinkers of that time had a rather clumsier way of putting the thing , they imagined a sort of individual choice of and assent to citizenship that never in fact occurred the socalled Social Contract . The Massachusetts preamble , for instance , asserts that the State is a voluntary association , " by which the whole people covenants with each citizen and each citizen with the whole people that all shall be governed by certain laws for the common good . " Now , it will be evident that most of these fundamental statements are very questionable statements . Men are not born equal , they are not born free ; they are born a most various multitude enmeshed in an ancient and complex social net . Nor is any man invited to sign the social contract , or , failing that , to depart into solitude . These statements , literally interpreted , are so manifestly false that it is impossible to believe that the men who made them intended them to be literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elusive but profoundly important ideas ? ideas that , after another century and a half of thinking , the world is in a better position to express . Civilization , as this Outline has shown , arose as a community of obedience , and was essentially a community of obedience . But generation after generation the spirit was abused by priests and rulers . There was a continual influx of masterful will from the forests , parklands and steppes . The human spirit had at last rebelled altogether against the blind obediences of the common life ; it was seeking ? and at first it was seeking very clumsily ? to achieve a new and better sort of civilizaREPUBLICS // lion that should also be a community of will . To that end it was necessary that every man should be treated as the sovereign of himself ; his standing was to be one of fellowship and not of servility . His real use , his real importance , depended upon his individual quality . The method by which these creators of political America sought to secure this community of will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was for the time , and in view of American conditions , a very wide franchise . Conditions varied in the different states ; the widest franchise was in Pennsyl- // vania , where every adult male taxpayer voted ; but , compared with Britain , all the United States were well within sight of manhood suffrage by the end of the eighteenth century . These makers of America also made efforts , considerable for their times , but puny by more modern standards , to secure a widely diffused common education . The information of the citizens as to what was going on at home and abroad they left , apparently without any qualms of misgiving , to public meetings and the privately owned printingpress . The story of the various state constitutions , and of the constitution of the United States as a whole , is a very intricate one , and we can only deal with it here in the broadest way . The most noteworthy point in a modern view is the disregard of women as citizens . The American community was a simple , largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed natural that they should be represented by their menfolk . But New Jersey admitted a few women to vote on a property qualification . Another point of great interest is the almost universal decision to have two governing assemblies , confirming or checking each other , on the model of the Lords and Commons of Britain . Only Pennsylvania had a single representative chamber , and that was felt to be a very dangerous and ultra-democratic state of affairs . Apart from the argument that legislation should be slow as well as sure , it is difficult to establish any necessity for this " bi-cameral " arrangement . It seems to have been a fashion with constitution planners in the eighteenth century rather than a reasonable imperative . The British division was an old one : the Lords , the original parliament , was an assembly of " notables , " the leading men of the kingdom ; the House of Commons came in as a new factor , as the elected spokesmen of the burghers and the small landed men . It was a little too hastily assumed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild impulses and would need checking ; opinion was for democracy , but for democracy with powerful brakes always on , whether it was going up hill or down . About all the upper houses there was , therefore , a flavour of selectness ; they were elected on a more limited franchise . This idea of making an upper chamber which shall be a stronghold for the substantial man does not appeal to modern thinkers so strongly as it did to the men of the eighteenth century , but the bi-cameral idea in another form still has its advocates . They suggest that a community may with advantage consider its affairs from two points of view ? through the eyes of a body elected to represent trades , // industries , professions , public services , and the like , a body representing function , and through the eyes of a second body elected by localities to represent communities . For the members of the former a man would vote by his calling , for the latter by his district of residence . They point out that the British I-louse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the land , the law , and the church are no doubt disproportionately represented , but in which industrialism , finance , the great public services , art , science , and medicine also find places ; and that the British House of Commons is purely geographical in its reference . It has even been suggested in Britain that there should be " labour peers , " selected from among the leaders of the great industrial trade unions . But these are speculations beyond our present scope . The Central Government of the United States was at first a very feeble body , a Congress of representatives of the thirteen governments , held together by certain Articles of Confederation . This Congress was little more than a conference of sovereign representatives ; it had no control , for instance , over the foreign trade of each state , it could not coin money nor levy taxes by its own authority . When John Adams , the first minister from the United States to England , went to discuss a commercial treaty with the British foreign secretary , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of the states concerned . He had to confess his inadequacy to make binding arrangements . The British presently began dealing with each state separately over the head of the Congress , and they retained possession of a number of posts in the American territory about the Great Lakes because of the inability of Congress to hold these regions effectually . In another urgent matter Congress proved equally feeble . To the west of the thirteen states stretched limitless lands into which settlers were now pushing in ever-increasing numbers . Each of the states had indefinable claims to expansion westward . It was evident to every clear-sighted man that the jostling of these claims must lead in the long run to war , unless the Central Government could take on their apportionment . The feeblenes of the Central Government , its lack of concentration , became so much of an inconvenience and so manifest a danger that there was some secret discussion of a monarchy , and Nathaniel Gorham of Massachusetts , the president of Congress , caused Prince Henry of Prussia , the brother of Frederick the Great , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention was called in 1787 at Philadelphia , and there it was that the present constitution of the United States was // on its broad lines hammered out . A great change of spirit had gone on during the intervening years , a widespread realization of the need of unity . When the Articles of Confederation were drawn up , men had thought of the people of Virginia , the people of Massachusetts , the people of Rhode Island , and the like ; but now there appears a new conception , " the people of the United States . " The new government , with the executive President , the senators , congressmen , and the Supreme Court , that was now created , was declared to be the government of " the pee of the United States " ; it was a synthesis and not a mere assembly .

The constitution then underwent considerable revision , and Washington upon the Potomac was built as the Federal capital . ? 6 In an earlier chapter we have described the Roman republic , and its mixture of modern features with dark superstition and primordial savagery , as the Neanderthal anticipation of the modern democratic state . A time may come when people will regard the contrivances and machinery of the American constitution as the political equivalents of the implements and contrivances of Neolithic man . They have served their purpose well , and under their protection the people of the States have grown into one of the greatest , most powerful and most civilized communities that the world has yet seen ; but there is no reason in that for regarding the American constitution as a thing more final and inalterable than the pattern of street railway that overshadows many New York thoroughfares , or the excellent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These things also have served a purpose well , they have their faults , and they can be improved . Our political contrivances , just as much as our domestic and mechanical contrivances need to undergo constant revision as knowledge and understanding grow . Since the American constitution was planned , our conception of history and our knowledge of collective psychology have under888 THE OUTLINE OF HISTORY gone very considerable development . We are beginning to see many things in the problem of government to which the men of the eighteenth century were blind ; and , courageous as their constructive disposition was in relation to whatever political creation had gone before , it fell far short of the boldness which we in these days realize to be needful if this great human problem of establishing a civilized community of will in the earth is to be solved . They took many things for granted that now we know need to be made the subject of the most exacting scientific study and the most careful adjustment . They thought it was only necessary to set up schools and colleges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they might then be left to themselves . But education is not a weed that will grow lustily in any soil , it is a necessary and delicate crop that may easily wilt and degenerate . We learn nowadays that the under-development of universities and educational machinery is like some under-development of the brain and nerves , which hampers the whole growth of the social body . By European standards , by the standard of any state that has existed hitherto , the level of the common education of America is high ; but by the standard of what it might be , America is an uneducated country . And those fathers of America thought also that they had but to leave the Press free , and everyone would live in the light . They did not realize that a free Press could develop a sort of constitutional venality due to its relations with advertisers , and that large newspaper proprietors could become buccaneers of opinion and insensate wreckers of good beginnings . And , finally , the makers of America had no knowledge of the complexities of vote manipulation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they knew nothing of the need of the transferable vote to prevent the " working " of elections by specialized organizations , and the crude and rigid methods they adopted left their political system the certain prey of the great party machines that have robbed American democracy of half its freedom and most of its political soul . Politics became a trade , and a very base trade ; decent and able men , after the first great period , drifted out of politics and attended to " business , " and the sense of the State declined . Private enterprise ruled in many matters of common concern , because political corruption made collective enterprise impossible . Yet the defects of the great political system created by the Americans of the revolutionary period did not appear at once . For several generations the history of the United States was one of rapid expansion and of an amount of freedom , homely happiREPUBLICS // ness , and energetic work unparalleled in the world 's history . And the record of America for the whole last century and a half , in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much rawness and much blundering , is nevertheless as bright and honourable a story as that of any other contemporary people . In this brief account of the creation of the United States of America we have been able to do little more than mention the names of some of the group of great men who made this new men as Thomas Paine , Bendeparture in human history . We have named casually or we have not even named such jamin Franklin P a t r i c k Henry , Thomas Jefferson , the A d a m s cousins , Madison , Alexander Hamilton , a n d George Washington . It is hard to measure the men of one period of history with those ) in another . Some writers , even American writers , impressed by the artificial splendours of the European courts and by - the tawdry and destructive exploits of a Frederick the Great or a Great Catherine , display a snobbish shame of something homespun about these makers of America . They feel that Benjamin Franklin at the Court of Louis XVI , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pawky manner , was sadly lacking in aristocratic distinction . But , stripped to their personalities , Louis XVI was hardly gifted enough or nobleminded enough to be Franklin 's valet . If human greatness is a matter of scale and glitter , then no doubt Alexander the Great is at the apex of human greatness . But is greatness that ? Is not a great man rather one who , in a great position or amidst great opportunities ? and great gifts are no more than great opportunities ? serves God and his fellows with a humble heart ? And quite a number of these Americans of the revolutionary time do seem to have displayed much disinterestedness and devotion . They were limited men , fallible men ; but on the whole they seem to have cared more for the commonweal they were creating than for any personal end or personal vanity . It is impossible not to concede them a distinguished greatness of mind . // True they were limited in knowledge and outlook ; they were limited by the limitations of the time . They were , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulses arose'in their minds , great ideas swept through them , and also they could be jealous , lazy , obstinate , greedy , vicious . If one were to write a true , full , and particular history of the making of the United States , it would have to be written with charity and high spirits as a splendid comedy rising to the noblest ends . And in no other regard do we find the rich , tortuous humanity of the American story so finely displayed as in regard to slavery . Slavery , having regard to the general question of labour , is the best of this new soul in the world 's history , the American soul . Slavery began very early in the European history of America , and no European people who went to America can be held altogether innocent in the matter . At a time when the German is still the moral ' whipping-boy of Europe , it is well to note that the German record is in this respect the best of all . Almost the first outspoken utterances against negro slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settler was working with free labour - upon a temperate country-side well north of the plantation zone ; he was not under serious temptation in this matter . American slavery began with the enslavement of Indians for gang work in mines and upon plantations , and it is curious to note that it was a very good and humane man indeed , Las Casas , who urged that negroes should be brought to America to relieve his tormented Indian proteges . The need for labour upon the plantations of the West Indies and the south was imperative . When the supply of Indian captives proved inadequate , the planters turned not only to the negro , but to the jails and poorhouses of Europe , for a supply of toilers . The reader of Defoe 's Moll Flanders will learn how the business of Virginian white slavery looked to an intelligent Englishman in the early eighteenth century . But the negro came very early . The year ( 1620 ) that saw the Pilgrim Fathers landing at Plymouth in New England , saw a // Dutch sloop disembarking the first cargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as old as New England ; it had been an American institution for over a century and a half before the War of Independence . It was to struggle on for the better part of a century more . But the conscience of thoughtful men in the colonies was never quite easy upon this score , and it was one of the accusations of Thomas Jefferson against the crown and lords of Great Britain that every attempt to ameliorate or restrain the slave trade on the part of the colonists had been checked by the great proprietary interests in the mother-country . In 1776 Lord Dartmouth wrote that the colonists could not be allowed " to check or discourage a traffic so beneficent to the nation . " With the moral and intellectual ferment of the Revolution , the question of negro slavery came right into the foreground of the public conscience . The contrast and the challenge glared upon the mind . " All men are by nature free and equal , " said the Virginia Bill of Rights ; and outside in the sunshine , under the whip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the great change in human ideas since the Roman Imperial system dissolved under the barbarian inrush , that there could be this heart-searching . Conditions of industry , production , and land tenure had long prevented any recrudescence of gang slavery ; but now the cycle had come round again , and there were enormous immediate advantages to be reaped by the owning and ruling classes in the revival of that ancient institution , in mines , upon plantations , and upon great public works . It was revived ? but against great opposition . From the beginning of the revival there were protests , and they grew . The revival was counter to the new conscience of mankind . In some respects the new gang slavery was worse than anything in the ancient world . Peculiarly horrible was the provocation by the trade of slave wars and man hunts in Western Africa , and the cruelties of the long Transatlantic voyage . The poor creatures were packed on the ships often with insufficient provision of food and water , without proper sanitation , without medicines . Many who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for their moral digestions . Three European nations were chiefly concerned in this dark business , Britain , Spain and Portugal , because they were the chief owners of the new lands in America . The comparative innocence of the other European powers is to be ascribed largely to // their lesser temptations . They were similar communities ; in parallel circumstances they would have behaved similarly . Throughout the middle part of the eighteenth century there was an active agitation against negro slavery in Great Britain as well as in the States . It was estimated that in 1770 there were fifteen thousand slaves in Britain , mostly brought over by their owners from the West Indies and Virginia . In 1771 the issue came to a conclusive test in Britain before Lord Mansfield . A negro named James Somersett had been brought to England from Virginia by his owner . He ran away , was captured , and violently taken on a ship to be returned to Virginia . From the ship he was extracted by a writ of habeas corpus . Lord Mansfield declared that slavery was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition ; and Somersett walked out of the court a free man . The Massachusetts constitution of 1780 had declared that " all men are born free and equal . " A certain negro , Quaco , put this to the test in 1783 , and in that year the soil of Massachusetts became like the soil of Britain , intolerant of slavery ; to tread upon it was to become free . At that time no other state in the Union followed this example . At the census of 1790 , Massachu setts , alone of all the states , returned " no slaves . " The state of opinion in Virginia is remarkable , because it brings to light the peculiar difficulties of the southern states . The great Virginian statesmen , such as Washington and Jefferson , condemned the institution , yet , because there was no other form of domestic service , Washington owned slaves . There was in Virginia a strong party in favour of emancipating slaves ; but they demanded that the emancipated slaves should leave the state within a year or be outlawed ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbaric black community , many of its members African-born and reeking with traditions of cannibalism and secret and dreadful religious rites , should arise beside them upon Virginian soil . When we consider that point of view , we can understand why it was that a large number of Virginans should be disposed to retain the mass of blacks in the country under control as slaves , while at the same time they were bitterly opposed to the slave trade and the importation of any fresh blood from Africa . The free blacks , one sees , might easily become a nuisance ; indeed , the free state of Massachusetts presently closed its borders to their entry . The question of slavery , which in the ancient world was usually no more than a question of status between individuals racially // skin , merged in America with the different and profounder question of relationship between two races at opposite extremes of the human species and of the most contrasted types of tradition and culture . If the black man had been white , there can be little doubt that negro slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Declaration of Independence as a natural consequence of the statements in that declaration . ? 7 We have told of the War of Independence in America as the first great break away from the system of European monarchies and foreign offices , as the repudiation by a new community of Machiavellian statecraft as the directive form of human affairs . Within a decade there came a second and much more portentous revolt against this strange game of Great Powers , this tangled interaction of courts and policies which obsessed Europe . But this time it was no breaking away at the outskirts . In France , the nest and home of Grand Monarchy , the heart and centre of Europe , came this second upheaval . And , unlike the American colonists , who simply repudiated a king , the French , following in the footsteps of the English revolution , beheaded one . Like the British Revolution and like the revolution in the United States , the French Revolution can be traced hack to the ambitious absurdities of monarchy . The schemes of aggrandizement , the aims and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war equipment throughout Europe out of all proportion to the taxable capacity of the age . And even the splendours of monarchy were enormously costly , measured by the productivity of the time . In France , just as in Britain and in America , the first resistance was made not to the monarch as such and to his foreign policy as such , nor with any clear recognition of these things as the roots of the trouble , but merely to the inconveniences and charges upon the individual life caused by them . The practical taxable capacity of France must have been relatively much less than that of England because of the various exemptions of the nobility and clergy . The burthen resting directly upon the common people was heavier . That made the upper classes the confederates of the Court , instead of the antagonists of the Court as they were in England , and so prolonged the period of waste further ; but when at last the bursting-point did come , the explosion was more violent and shattering . // During the years of the War of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France . There was much misery among the lower classes , much criticism and satire , much outspoken liberal thinking , but there was little to indicate that the thing as a whole , with all its customs , usages , and familiar discords , might not go on for an indefinite time . It was consuming beyond its powers of production , but as yet only the inarticulate classes were feeling the pinch . Gibbon , the historian , knew France well ; Paris was as familiar to him as London ; but there is no suspicion to be detected in the passage we have quoted that days of political and social dissolution were at hand . No doubt the world abounded in absurdities and injustices , yet nevertheless , from the point of view of a scholar and a gentleman , it was fairly comfortable , and it seemed fairly secure . There was much liberal thought , speech , and sentiment in France at this time . Parallel with and a little later than John Locke in England , Montesquieu ( 1689 ? 1755 ) in France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjected social , political , and religious institutions to the same searching and fundamental analysis , especially in his Esprit des Lois . He had stripped the magical prestige from the absolutist monarchy in France . He shares with Locke the credit for clearing away many of the false ideas that had hitherto prevented deliberate and conscious attempts to reconstruct human society . It was not his fault if at first some extremely unsound and impermanent shanties were run up on the vacant site . The generation that followed him in the middle and later decades of the eighteenth century was boldly speculative upon the moral and intellectual clearings he had made . A group of brilliant writers , the " Encyclopedists , " mostly rebel spirits from the excellent schools of the Jesuits , set themselves under the leadership of Diderot to scheme out , in a group of works , a new world ( 1766 ) . The glory of the Encyclopxdists , says Mallet , lay " in their hatred of things unjust , in their denunciation of the trade in slaves , of the inequalities of taxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wars , in their dreams of social progress , in their sympathy with the rising empire of industry which was beginning to transform the world . " Their chief error seems to have been an indiscriminate hostility to religion . They believed that man was naturally just and politically competent , whereas his impulse to social service and self-forgetfulness is usually developed only through an education essentially religious , // and sustained only in an atmosphere of honest co-operation . Uncoordinated human initiatives lead to nothing but social chaos . Side by side with the Encyclopaedists were the Economists or Physiocrats , who were making bold and crude inquiries into the production and distribution of food and goods . Morally , the author of the Code de la Nature denounced the institution of private property and proposed a communistic organization of society . He was the precursor of that large and various school of collectivist thinkers in the nineteenth century who are lumped together as Socialists . . Both the Encyclopaedists and the various Economists and Physiocrats demanded a considerable amount of hard thinking in their disciples . An easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . He displayed a curious mingling of logical rigidity and sentimental enthusiasm . He preached the alluring doctrine that the primitive state of man was one of virtue and happiness , from which he had declined through the rather inexplicable activities of priests , kings , lawyers , and the like . Rousseau 's intellectual influence was on the whole demoralizing . It struck not only at the existing social fabric , but at any social organization . When he wrote of the Social Contract , he seemed rather to excuse breaches of the covenant than to emphasize its necessity . Man is so far from perfect , that a writer who apparently sustained the thesis that the almost universal disposition , against which we all have to fortify ourselves , to repudiate debts , misbehave sexually , and to evade the toil and expenses of education for ourselves and others , is not after all a delinquency , but a fine display of Natural Virtue , was bound to have a large following in every class that could read him . Rousseau 's tremendous vogue did much to popularize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political problems . We have already remarked that hitherto no human community had begun to act upon theory . There must first be some breakdown and necessity for direction that lets theory into her own . Up to 1788 the republican and anarchist talk and writing of French thinkers must have seemed as ineffective and politically unimportant as the aesthetic socialism of William Morris in England at the end of the nineteenth century . There was the social and political system going on with an effect of invincible persistence , the French king hinting and mending his clocks , the Court and the world of fashion pursuing their pleasures , the financiers conceiving continually more enterprising extensions of credit , busi896 THE OUTLINE OF HISTORY ness blundering clumsily along its ancient routes , much incommoded by taxes and imposts , the peasants worrying , toiling and suffering , full of a hopeless hatred of the nobleman 's chateau . Men talked ? and felt they were merely talking . Anything might be said , because , it seemed , nothing would ever happen . ? 8 The first jar to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1787 . Louis XVI ( 1774 ? 93 ) was a dull , illeducated monarch , and he had the misfortune to be married to a silly and extravagant woman , Marie Antoinette , the sister of the Austrian emperor . The question of her virtue is one of profound interest to a certain type of historical writer , but we need not discuss it here . She lived , as Paul Wiriathi puts it , " side by side , but not at the side " of her husband . She was rather heavy-featured , but not so plain as to prevent her posing as a beautiful , romantic and haughty queen . When the exchequer was exhausted by the war in America , when the whole country was uneasy with discontents , she set her influence to thwart the attempts at economy of the king 's ministers , to encourage every sort of aristocratic extravagance , and to restore the church and the nobility to the position they had held in the great days of Louis XIV . Nonaristocratic officers were to be weeded from the army ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be extended . She found in an upper-class official , Calonne , her ideal minister of finance . From 1783 to 1787 this wonderful man produced money as if by magic ? and as if by magic it disappeared again . Then in 1787 he collapsed . He had piled loan on loan , and now he declared that the monarchy , the Grand Monarchy that had ruled France since the days of Louis XIV , was bankrupt . No more money could be raised . There must be a gathering of the notables of the kingdom to consider the situation . To the gathering of notables , a summoned assembly of leading men , Calonne propounded a scheme for a subsidy to be levied upon all landed property . This roused the aristocrats to a pitch of great indignation . They demanded the summoning of a body roughly equivalent to the British parliament ? the States General , which had not met since 1614 . Regardless of the organ of opinion they were creating for the discontents below them , excited only 1Article " France , " Encyclopedia Britannice. r @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weight of the financial burthens of the country , the French notables insisted . And in May , 1789 , the States General met . It was an assembly of the representatives of three orders , the nobles , the clergy , and the Third Estate , the commons . For the Third Estate the franchise was very wide , nearly every taxpayer of twenty-five having a vote . ( The parish priests voted as clergy , the small noblesse as nobles . ) The States General was a body without any tradition of procedure . Inquiries were sent to the antiquarians of the Academy of Inscriptions in that matter . Its opening deliberations turned on the question whether it was to meet as one body or as three , each estate having an equal vote . Since the Clergy numbered 308 , the Nobles 285 , and the Deputies 621 , the former arrangement would put the commons in an absolute majority , the latter gave them one vote in three . Nor had the States General any meeting-place . Should it meet in Paris or in some provincial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting . " It is clear that the king and queen meant to treat this fuss about the national finance as a terrible bore , and to allow it to interfere with their social routine as little as possible . We find the meetings going on in salons that were not wanted , in orangeries and tenniscourts , and so forth . The question whether the voting was to be by the estates or by head was clearly a vital one . It was wrangled over for six weeks . The Third Estate , taking a leaf from the book of the English House of Commons , then declared that it alone represented the nation , , and that no taxation must be levied henceforth without its consent . Whereupon the king closed the hall in which it was sitting , and intimated that the deputies had better go home . Instead , the deputies met in a convenient tennis-court , and there took oath ? the Oath of the Tennis Court ? not to separate until they had established a constitution in France . The king took a high line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force . The soldiers refused to act . On that the king gave in with a dangerous suddenness , and accepted the principle that the Three Estates should all deliberate and vote together as one National Assembly . Meanwhile , apparently at the queen 's instigation , foreign regiments in the French service , who could be trusted to act against the people , were brought up from the provinces under the Marshal de Broglie , and the king prepared to go back upon his concessions . hereupon Paris and France revolted . ? 6 // Broglie hesitated to fire on the crowds . A provisional city government was set up in Paris and in most of the other large cities , and a new armed force , the National Guard , a force designed primarily and plainly to resist the forces of the crown , was brought into existence by these municipal bodies . The revolt of July , 1789 , was really the effective French Revolution . The grim-looking prison of the Bastille , very feebly defended , was stormed by the people of Paris , and the insurrection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provinces many chateaux belonging to the nobility were burnt by the peasants , their title-deeds carefully destroyed , and the owners murdered or driven away . The insurrection spread throughout France . In a month the ancient and decayed system of the aristocratic order had collapsed . Many of the leading princes and courtiers of the queen 's party fled abroad . The National Assembly found itself called upon to create a new political and social system for a new age . ? 9 The French National Assembly was far less fortunate in the circumstances of its task than the American Congress . The latter had half a continent to itself , with no possible antagonist but the British Government . Its religious and educational organizations were various , collectively not very powerful , and on the whole friendly . King George was far away in England , and sinking slowly towards an imbecile condition . Nevertheless , it took the United States several years to hammer out a working constitution . The French , on the other hand , were surrounded by aggressive neighbours with Machiavellian ideas , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the church was one single great organization inextricably bound up with the ancient order . The queen was in close correspondence with the Count of Artois , the Duke of Bourbon , and the other exiled princes who were trying to induce Austria and Prussia to attack the new French nation . Moreover , France was already a bankrupt country , while the United States had limitless undeveloped resources ; and the Revolution , by altering the conditions of land tenure and marketing , had produced an economic disorganization that had no parallel in the case of America . These were the unavoidable difficulties of the situation . But in addition the Assembly made difficulties for itself . There was no orderly procedure . The English House of Commons had had more // than five centuries of experience in its work , and Mirabeau , one of the great leaders of the early Revolution , tried in vain to have the English rules adopted . But the feeling of the times was all in favour of outcries , dramatic interruptions , and such-like manifestations of Natural Virtue . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a great gallery , much too great a gallery , for strangers ; but who would restrain the free citizens from having a voice in the national control ? This gallery swarmed with people eager for a " scene , " ready to applaud or shout down the speakers below . The abler speakers were obliged to play to the gallery , and take a sentimental and sensational line . It was easy at a crisis to bring in a mob to kill debate . So encumbered , the Assembly set about its constructive task . On the Fourth of August it achieved a great dramatic success . Led by several of the liberal nobles , it made a series of resolutions , abolishing serfdom , privileges , tax exemptions , tithes and feudal courts . ( In many parts of the country , however , thee-esolutions were not carried into effect until three or four years later . ) Titles went with their other renunciations . Long before France was a republic it was an offence for a nobleman to sign his name with his title . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for rhetoric , to the formulation of a Declaration of the Rights of Man ? on the lines of the Bills of Rights that were the English preliminaries to organized change . Meanwhile the Court plotted for reaction , and the people felt that the Court was plotting . The story is complicated here by the scoundrelly schemes of the king 's cousin , Philip of Orleans , who hoped to use the discords of the time to replace Louis on the French throne . His gardens at the Palais-Royal were thrown open to the public , and became a great centre of advanced discussion . His agents did much to intensify the popular suspicion of the king . And things were exacerbated by a shortage of provisions ? for which the king 's government was held guilty . Presently the loyal Flanders regiment appeared at Versailles . Th1e , royal family was scheming to get farther away from Paris ? in baler to undo all that had been done , to restore tyranny and extravagance . Such constitutional monarchists as General Lafayette were seriously alarmed . And just at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food , that passed by an easy transition into indignation against the threat of royalist reaction . It was believed that there was an abundance of provisions at Versailles ; that food was being kept there away from // the people . The public mind had been much disturbed by reports , possibly by exaggerated reports , of a recent banquet at Versailles , hostile to the nation . Here are some extracts from Carlyle descriptive of that unfortunate feast . " The Hall of the Opera is granted ; the Salon d'Hercule shall be drawing-room . Not only the Officers of- Flandre , but of the Swiss , of the Hundred Swiss ; nay of the Versailles National Guard , such of them as have any loyalty , shall feast ; it will be a Repast like few . " And now suppose this Repast , the solid part of it , transacted ; and the first bottle over . Suppose the customary loyal toasts drunk ; the King 's health , the Queen 's with deafening vivats ; that of the nation omitted , ' or even rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with instrumental music ; empty featherheads growing ever the noisier , in their own emptiness , in each other 's noise . Her Majesty , who looks unusually sad to-night ( His Majesty sitting dulled with the day 's hunting ) , is told that the sight of it would cheer her . Behold ! She enters there , issuing from her State-rooms , like the Moon from clouds , this fairest unhappy Queen of Hearts ; royal Husband by her side , young Dauphin in her arms ! She descends from the Boxes , amid splendour and acclaim ; walks queen-like round the Tables ; gracefully nodding ; her looks full of sorrow , yet of gratitude and daring , with the hope of France on her mother-bosom ! And now , the band striking up , 0 Richard , 0 mon Roi , l'univers t'abandonne ( 0 Richard , 0 my king , the world is all forsaking thee ) , could man do other than rise to height of pity , of loyal valour ?

" There was much shouting and coming and going in Paris before this latter idea realized itself . One Maillard appeared with organizing power , and assumed a certain leadership . There can be little doubt that the revolutionary leaders , and particularly General Lafayette , used and organized this outbreak to secure the king , before he could slip away ? as Charles I did to Oxford ? to begin a civil war . As the afternoon wore on , the procession started on its eleven-mile tramp Again we quote Carlyle : " Maillard has halted his draggled Menads on the last hill-top ; and now Versailles , and the Chateau of Versailles , and far and wide the inheritance of Royalty opens to the wondering eye .
