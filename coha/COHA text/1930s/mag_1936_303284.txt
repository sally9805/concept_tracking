Last week the " Big Five " U. S. airlines finally took off on an industrial flight which they had long feared the Government might frown upon ( TIME , March 16 ) . From the Air Transport Association of America 's headquarters in Chicago , American , Eastern , Pan American , United and Transcontinental &; Western Airlines announced they had abandoned competition in equipment , would collaborate in creating a standardized fleet of huge transport planes . To Douglas Aircraft Co. of Santa Monica , Calif. , current darling of most of the world 's leading airlines , went the contract to develop the new type transport . <P> Based on a year 's study , the specifications for the new plane fill 195 pages , are the most complete ever drafted . In general the standardized supership will resemble the famed Douglas DC2 and the new DST , but it will be nearly twice the former 's size , with 140-ft. wingspread , 95-ft. length , 25-ton weight , four motors . Able to seat 40 passengers or sleep 20 , it will have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 210 at 75% horsepower , will be able to fly coast-to-coast with two stops in 13 hours , from New York to New Orleans non-stop in less than five . For safety , it will be able to take off on three engines , fly on two . Inside , it will be as luxurious as the China Clipper , which is not quite so big . The passenger cabin will be 40 ft. long , 10 ft. wide , with a double row of seats on each side , convertible at night into compartments bigger than Pullman berths . <P> Cost for the first plane , due next spring , is $500,000 , for subsequent ships $250,000 . By shouldering this sum jointly , the " Big Five " claim they are saving three-quarters of development expense . By creating such a fleet of supertransports , they expect to jack their passenger and express business into the black , rid themselves forever of the inconvenience of their present dependence upon Government mail subsidies .                 @ @ @ @
