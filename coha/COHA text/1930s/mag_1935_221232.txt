Piped ashore from the Houston at Balboa last week , Franklin Roosevelt for the second time in his Administration set foot in the Panama Canal Zone . Refreshed by a fortnight at sea , the President proceeded to turn on his most charmful smile . Taken out twelve miles through the jungle to see the new $13,000,000 Madden Dam on the Chagres River , completed since Mr. Roosevelt 's westward passage across the Isthmus last year and calculated to supplement the Canal 's water supply by 22 billion cubic feet , he graciously remarked : " When you compare the two , you would n't believe that Boulder is so much bigger than this . It is about three times as high , but it does n't look it . " And when President Harmodio Arias , whom President Roosevelt had just dubbed " the Canal Zone 's best neighbor , " lit the cigarets of Mr. Roosevelt and Canal Zone Governor Schley , then his own on the same match , the U. S. President chuckled : " It 's obvious that you 're not an Irishman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five regiments at Fort Clayton , recently branded a " suicide post " by rambunctious Publisher Nelson Rounsevell of the Panama American ( TIME , Sept. 30 ) . Following the review , the President pointedly wirelessed Major General Harold B. Fiske , commander of the Panama Canal Department who had sued Publisher Rounsevell for criminal libel and won : " Will you publish to your command my recognition and appreciation of the fine soldierly bearing and appearance of the troops at Fort Clayton ? " <P> Clearing the Canal , the Houston 's party went sightseeing around the old harbor of Porto Bello , visited the Panamanian San Blas Islands . <P> Native Indians welcomed ashore WPAdministrator Harry Hopkins and PWAdministrator Harold Ickes , who peeped over his spectacles at the surrounding thatched huts , drew a laugh from the party by remarking : " Low-cost housing ! " <P> Meantime an Indian with his shirt tail out , smoked glasses over his eyes and a battered Army campaign hat on his head climbed aboard the Houston . This was Chief Olo-Benanya of the San Blas come to call on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no English and Chief Roosevelt spoke no Chibchan . Nevertheless , the Indian managed to barter some spears and a handful of sharks ' teeth for several cartons of cigarets from Mr. Roosevelt . This deal accomplished , the Presidential party sailed up the squally Caribbean , planning to land at Charleston , S. C. and be back in Washington by the middle of this week .
