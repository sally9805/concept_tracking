MARRIAGES are such unstable things these days that anything that suggests ways in which they may become less so , is valuable . Last year , on a trip through American colleges and universities , I was struck by the number of happy marriages among the teachers and administrators , many of whom told me that they and their wives had been students together . One of them , the delightful and distinguished president of one of the largest state universities in the country , replying to my comment on this , said : " I believe you will find that this is so because the special conditions of campus courtships not only give people unusual opportunities for complete knowledge of each other before marriage , but also create a community of interest that rarely can exist in marriages made in the ordinary way . My wife and I met when we were students here , and we have spent all our adult lives together . Therefore , we have no hidden places one from the other ; we have had the same friends and the same interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same loyalties . " As my train sped toward the setting sun , I pondered this , and thought that it might be interesting to find out whether it and the other instances that had come to my attention were isolated ones , or whether there were really some special elements in such marriages that contributed to their success . So , as I went on , I asked the Deans or the Presidents or the Alumni Secretaries of about a hundred of our leading coeducational institutions about the comparative success of marriages made between their graduates , and of marriages in general . Strangely enough , considering our presentday craze for statistics , few of them had complete records about the separations or divorces of their graduates . Marriages , births , deaths ? on all these they had complete figures , with learned conclusions drawn from them . But on separation and divorce there had often been a thoughtless , or a discreet , lack of questioning . Still , since colleges do keep in pretty close touch with their graduates through the class and alumni officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ation , even though it is not supported by complete figures . It . shows this : that there are only about one-eighth as many divorces from college-made marriages as - there are among the general marriages in the country . In 1900 , there was one divorce for every twelve marriages iri the United States ; in 1929 , there was one in every six ; the average for the thirty years is a little less than one in every nine . There is a record of only one divorce for every seventy-five of the marriages made between the men and women who met at coeducational colleges . In other words , if we may consider these records worth anything at all , and if the comparison with the average rate for the past thirty years in the country generally is a fair one , marriages consummated after college courtships have more than eight times the chances of happiness that other marriages have . It is true that some part of this difference might be accounted for by the different attitude toward divorce in the homes and  | in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students . But the difference is too great to be entirely or even largely accounted for in this way . Besides , such figures as we have show that the locality is not an important factor , for they show the same decided contrasts in each of the states . In Ohio , there is one divorce for every 4.3 marriages ; in the Ohio colleges , the few figures available show one divorce or separation for every thirty-five marriages . In Vermont , there is one divorce for every 6.7 marriages ; the college figures show but one in every seventy marriages . In Texas , there is one divorce for every 5.2 marriages ; marriages culminating college courtships show but one to every fiftynine . In Kansas , there is one divorce to every 5. r marriages ; only one in a hundred of the coeducational marriages ends in court . So we could follow the figure through every state in the Union , and ever though allowance is made for the incom. pleteness of the college figures , and for the ? se here of the 1929 government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is true , also , that the age of the partici pants in these marriages may be a factor College marriages are necessarily - later , no only because of the frequently higher livin ( standards of college people and their later entry into the business world , but also because , while ultimately they make more money than do their non-college confreres , it takes college graduates several years after the acquirement of their sheepskins to make up for the four-years start of their contemporaries who have not gone to college . Therefore , since a great many divorces are granted to those who have married before their twenties , or in their very early twenties , it is possible that the elimination of this group accounts for some of the difference . Of course , divorce figures , even if complete , do not in themselves prove the success or failure of marriages , for there can be tremendous unhappiness in homes which , for any number of reasons , mistaken or otherwise , are held together . But since the intellectual classes seem less likely than others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this must be in favor of the happy marriage percentage . Even allowing for all of these possibilities , however , the difference between the success of coeducational and other marriages is so striking as to make it seem certain that there is some special element in the former that contributes to their happiness . If we can find out what this element is ? or these elements are ? we may perhaps make some constructive contribution to the problem in general . A year or so ago , the psychiatrist , Dr. G. V. Hamilton , made an investigation of the marital happiness of two hundred couples . This revealed that there was an average of fifty-eight and a half percent of happy marriages between men and women of equal degrees of formal education , whereas there were only forty-three and a half percent where the husband 's education was superior , and fifty-five percent where the wife had a better education . It is interesting to note , parenthetically , that in the cases where one of the marriage partners had a  | ( Continued from page 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was evidently happier in the superiority of his mate than was the mate in the knowledge of that superiority , forty-eight percent of the women married to better educated husbands being happy , while only thirty-eight percent of i the husbands were happy under these circumstances ; where the wife 's education was superior , only thirty-two percent of them were happy , although , contrary to popular opinion about a man 's resentment of a wife 's superior education , seventy-eight percent of the husbands married to better educated wives claimed to be happy in their marriages . Of the pessimistic appearance of these figures in general , and of its probable explanation in the group investigated , there is no need to speak here . The figures , being based on a special group , are used only for their value in making this particular point , that people who have had the same educational opportunities are , other things being equal , more attuned mentally- than those who have not . If this is true , surely those whose education has been not only equal but similar are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the important bases for a contented companionship . Sex , despite its exaggeration in the literature and the conversation of the day , and its unquestioned contribution to the peace and happiness of marriage , must in the average home be submerged sooner or later in common family , social , and intellectual interests . A large proportion of the two hundred thousand divorces granted in the United States last year were granted on the ground of incompatibility . While it is true that this is often used as a cloak for other causes , it is doubly true that the other causes , admitted and unadmitted , conscious or subconscious , are most frequently caused by incompatibility . If people love each other , if they have many things in common , if they are happy living together , they are willing to put up with many things in order to retain their companionship . If they do not love each other , if they have little in common , and if living together is irritating and brings out the rough edges of each other 's dispositions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an excuse for ending an unhappy situation . In an earlier day , when " until death do us part " was taken seriously by the majority of people , married couples , particularly the women , brought up as they were on the fallacy of the double standard and the theory that their lot was to endure with resignation , often went to extremes of misery rather than break up their homes . Today , on the contrary , the attitude toward marriage is so casual that young people do not even allow time for the normal , necessary adjustments before flying to the divorce courts . Many of the factors which , according to the experts , lead them there would seem to be minimized by the conditions of courtship on a coeducational campus . Dr. Alfred Adler , the distinguished Viennese psychologist , believes that one of the great underlying causes of the things that make for marital discord is the ingrained belief of both men and women , of woman 's inferiority . This causes her either to undervalue or overassert herself , while it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in twentiethcentury America . Justice Morschauer of the New York Supreme Court refers to one of the results of this when he says that the rock on which many marriages are wrecked is man 's confirmed belief that whatever he does is important , and that anything his wife does is unimportant . Neither of these spring-boards to the divorce court is so likely to be used by men and women who have worked and played side by side in a place and at a time when their work and play have been on a par as to value and importance .  | Another closely allied cause of unhappiness I in marriage is the lack of respect of married people for each other . Men particularly , if all their intellectual contacts have been with other men , and their only contacts with girls have been in their ? and the girls ' ? lighter moments , are likely to view women as their intellectual inferiors . There is a story of a man of this sort who said to a girl , " I never discuss things with women ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I do n't . " Those of us who are college women like to think that if the man had said this to a college woman , her reply would have been different , even though it spoiled the story ; we are sure that had he been accustomed to matching wits with women as he would have had to be at a coeducational college , to seeing their opinions equally respected whether in class meeting or in classroom , he would never have had the thought . Jealousy is another wide-open door to the divorce courts . If a man has never seen the girl of his choice in friendly , normal contacts with other men , if a girl has never seen her fiance in pleasant , ordinary day-to-day friendships with other girls , each is likely to misunderstand and to resent such contacts and friendships after marriage . Yet in this day of equality of the sexes , men and women must meet on an equal and natural footing in all the relationships of life , commercial , social , and I intellectual . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so taken for granted , as it is on a coeducational campus ; there is no other place where men and women are so prepared for accepting it naturally in later life . The Matter of Money The handling of money , whether parsimoniously or extravagantly , by one or the other of a married pair , is another frequent cause of family dissension . The average courtship does not allow a chance to observe ? nor its brevity time to overcome the delicacy of speaking about ? money matters . Usually , if a girl has been accustomed to charging things to her father without question , and knows the difference between a penny and a dollar only by the figures on the back , a man has no way of discovering it until after marriage . The college girl , despite the popular picture of the extravagant , prom-trotting student , has usually been trained to handle money economically . 1 The large majority of coeducational college students are in moderate circumstances , so there is not the temptation to extravagance that keeping up with the Joneses of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make a difference , the coeducational courtship gives a man , as well as a girl , the chance to observe these traits , and to discuss the practical questions they involve , in advance . The wife of a mid-western Dean told me that she had tried in vain to make her fiance more careful in money matters while they were in college . He had not had much money , but he simply could not hold on to what he had ; he bought gifts for her that he could not afford , and she did not have the heart to chide him for it because the giving brought him so much joy ; he gave to impecunioys ? or merely spendthrift or unscrupulous ? classmates , even though it meant going without the necessities himself . She recognized the fundamentally desirable quality that underlay this , but she also knew that it was a poor virtue on which to found a home . So , before their marriage , they agreed ' that a certain percentage of his income would always go into a special bank account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their home and their future , but more than anything had ever done before , it taught him the value of saving and helped him to overcome his fault . When a husband 's and a wife 's loyalties are centered in the same institution , there is another advantage in connection with money that is rarer , but sufficiently common to justify mention . Today the colleges are all seeking  | money not only to take care of the increasing numbers who storm their doors , but also to pay their professors a wage consistent with the living standard to which they and their families are entitled . A few years ago , my own college had a campaign for funds . A graduate , the wife of a wellknown banker who had just given a quarter of a million dollars to his own college , was put down as a prospective donor of a large sum . I was delegated to go to see her . Not only was she unable to give a sum consistent with her husband 's gift for his college ; she was unable even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the campaign with gifts of a thousand dollars each . She told me frankly that it was a humiliation to her , but that her husband felt that he had given all he cared to give for education to his own college . Alen and women who have been educated together not only do not have this problem , but the attitude of mind and habit of individual thought that create it are unlikely with them . Their whole education tends to set their minds along ways of understanding and mutual appreciation . A Chance to Compare These are a few of the recognized pitfalls of marriage that would seem to be lessened by coeducation . The coeducational college girl , too , sees a good many men , probably has a number of beaux before she settles into a steady friendship with one , so that she has some basis for comparison ; she is not just in love with love ; her marriage is the outcome not merely of an emotion , but of a tried and proved friendship . Men , too , who are accustomed to thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater freedom of expression , are likely to be more articulate with women than those who have been accustomed to using their best thoughts with men only . This contributes much to the happiness of a woman , even though unlike her sister of an earlier day , love is not her " whole existence , " and even though , having grown gradually into a friendship with her man that frees their love from dependence on the expression of his ardor , she does not expect him to spend all his time figuratively singing beneath her window . In addition to all this , there is a special benefit to those who spend their college years on the same campus . During the ordinary courtship it is so easy to show only one 's best side . Every one has special virtues that appear when all the stars are converging favorably for him . Moreover , love is a softening , ennobling sentiment which , when it enters the heart , transforms the person feeling it so that for the time being he has only a fine , noble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If his courtship is a brief matter of a few starlit nights and gala days , a romance made up of moonlight and illusion joined by dear imagined qualities and virtues that exist only in his own eager mind , he has no way of knowing that these qualities and virtues may be but parts of a temporary transformation . He or she ? believes that this fine , noble , and generous person with whom he has fallen in love is real . He can not know that she may be a men wraith of moonbeams , romance , and imagination which will vanish with the first touch o1 reality , leaving in its place only ordinary human clay with all the pettinesses and weaknesses that flesh is heir to . The usual coeducational courtship is carried on over a period of three or four years , at a time when boys and girls are keen in observation , analytical of themselves and of others and tremendously critical ? which is important when choosing a life partner . During that time they have every opportunity to see eacl other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletic field , in the fraternity house and the social hall , under conditions of stress as well as under happier circumstances A girl is given the opportunity to know that  | the socially attractive boy may be only that while others who do not shine socially may have the real qualities that make for stability it marriage , as in life ; she is given a chance to se ( that the boy who is an all-American football star or an all-Hollywood ideal of masculine beauty may be lazy or dull of mind . The young man , for his part , even though he be . lieves , like every other man in love , that hi ; choice is the best there is , bases this belief ? am such idealization as is a necessary part of it ? on the reality that is part of time and growth he has had time to see beneath the surface prettiness that has caught his eye . A girl I know went to a large Eastern coeducational college with a bad case of puppy love for a home-town boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always had a sense of disappointment in him on her brief visits home . She certainly would never have married him had she had the opportunity a college campus would have given her to analyze the reasons back of her disappointment and to realize the rightness of it . But the long absences set the current of her feelings so strongly toward him that the vacation waverings never had a chance against them , and she went through with the marriage after she graduated , despite the proposal of a man in her class with whom she had had a fine friendship . The marriage lasted just three years . A few years later , she met the other man at a college reunion , and they were married and have lived happily ever since , a matter now of some eight or nine years . This does not prove the case for coeducational marriages , of course . Many second marriages based on increased wisdom and experience are happier than first ones . But a coeducational campus does give special opportunities for wisdom in first choices . Throughout their courtship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other and on each other 's interests than they ordinarily are elsewhere . Usually , having little money to spend on outside entertainment , they are thrown on their own resources . This means that they can make a better test of each other than would be possible if most of their hours together were spent at a country club or at the movies . Also , being with those of their own age , rather than against a background of their elders , they are better able to judge each other in their relations with their contemporaries . If their love can survive the thorough knowledge of each other afforded by all this , as well as the prolonged test of the durability of their emotional reactions to each other , it is reasonably safe to assume that it will survive the further test of marriage ; they are likely to smile at idiosyncrasies that are familiar to them , to be more tolerant toward weaknesses and faults that they have known in advance . Pleasant Memories Shared " My personal opinion is that marriage between college graduates who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which contribute to their happiness , " says the distinguished Dean of a large university in Illinois . " There is a charm and romance in college life that places around their courtship memories that offer an endless source of pleasant recollections . I believe that these mutual recollections are of distinct value in binding people together . It gives them a common heritage from romantic days . Furthermore , the college age is an age at which intellectual interests are quickened . Quite frequently the boy and girl develop a number of interests in common . My wife and I fused our interest in drama and poetry during our undergraduate days . As far as my personal observations go , I know of few people engaged while in college whose marriages have gone on the rocks . I know of many , many happy couples who worked out a mutual understanding during college days . " This Dean refers also , as do a number of other administrators , to the many happy marriages  | that have been contracted between couples who have met in the professional schools , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in medicine , or in architecture together . This gives us a modern version of the contented couple who tilled the soil or kept their little shop together , their common struggle as well as their common interest holding them in a close bond . So far I have referred only to the advantages of the coeducational campus in preparing for marriage . I have done this largely because coeducation has certain advantages peculiarly its own from the point of view of marriage , including some , notably the time element , which apply especially to boys and girls who have spent their college years on the same campus . Other of the advantages , including those of respect and understanding , apply to all boys and girls who have been coeducated , whether they have been coeducated on the same campus with their future mates , or not . But the startlingly low divorce rate* for the women 's colleges , though based on figures even less general than those for the coeducational institutions , suggests that all education ? of women , at any rate ? contributes to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not alone in the understanding due to her long , close and informal contacts with boys , especially with the boy of her choice , that a college girl is prepared to make a contented home . It would seem that an investigation of the elements that go to make up a satisfactory modern family life would reveal some that are also fostered in segregated institutions . College Wives A generation or so ago , when family life was led almost entirely within the four walls of a home , wives were kept so busy with household duties , in many cases so onerous as to be household drudgeries , that the domestic and physical tie was sufficient to keep so interdependent a structure together , usually in peace and contentment . But in these days of complexity of human relations , of constant motion and change , of labor-saving devices including nursery schools and play-groups , of interests varied as among husbands , wives and children , and with little except their own desires to keep any of them within the home , it is not so easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , even in these modern days , rests the chief responsibility for making the home a desirable haven for her family , must bring to it more than she needed to bring formerly . Three or four years of college is valuable training for this . Working with others in the academic and social interests of the college gives a girl a knowledge , an understanding , and usually a sympathetic attitude toward different personalities ; constant contacts with others make her adaptable , an invaluable quality in these days of rapid change . The college girl , too , is likely to have friends wherever she goes ? it is amazing how every college of any size throws its tentacles into every town and hamlet ; she has many interests , and is predominantly helpful in the charitable and intellectual activities of the community in which she lives . All of this means not only that she is better fitted to cope with the varying personalities of her household , and to bring to it fresh and varied activities and viewpoints , but that she can order her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedies of marriage arise from a wife 's becoming morbid , or dull and uninteresting to her husband , because of her lack of occupation and interests , or from her inability or refusal to understand his preoccupation with his work . Most men begin growing and developing with marriage ; many 1 women stop their growth when they have I achieved that goal . This is not usually true of the college girl , especially of the coed , who has been accustomed to going along with her man  | in his social and intellectual life , to working with him and to being ambitious for his success . Nor is she now likely to be jealous of his professional or vocational work ; rather , she is eager for him to get ahead in it , and does not expect him to neglect it for her . The list of happy marriages begun on college campuses is a long one , headed by no less distinguished a couple than the President of the United States and Mrs. Hoover , who met at Leland Stanford University . Their friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time . Like the testimonials to the benefits of patent medicines , testimonials to the success of these college marriages can be cited from all parts of the country . From the Dean of a small , non-sectarian institution of high standing in Nebraska , we have this : " Like most other coeducational institutions , this college might be called a match factory . ' To illustrate , I may cite the example of one class about ten years out of college . There were seven men and nine women in the graduating class . Four of the men married their own classmates ; two of the remaining three married women who were fellow-students in college . Of the remaining five women in the class , two married men who were not fellow students ; two of them have not married . One of the men and one of the women married outside the college group . I know the members of this class intimately , and all the marriages would be judged successful by any high standard . This class is undoubtedly an exception so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience will indicate the general satisfactoriness of such marriages . " And from the Dean of a large sectarian college in Texas : " Perhaps I am a prejudiced witness on such marriages , for I secured my own wife on the campus while she was a student and I was a young instructor . Moreover , her sister and one of her brothers and one of her cousins in college at about the same time did the same thing . All of these marriages have been happy and successful . And this is not only a family affair , for there are one hundred and ten other couples besides us , including ten of our present faculty members . " The Dean of a small but very distinguished Eastern college adds his testimony : " My personal opinion is that the man and woman who can not make a success of marriage after four years of close acquaintanceship such as is possible in a small coeducational college probably would not be able to make a success of marriage under any circumstances . " The Safest Marriages SO WE have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it does for the life of which marriage is so important a part . Segregated education has its points , at least for a woman , as preparation for the making of a happy home . Coeducation has the further advantage of the closer and more normal relations between the sexes . Coeducation on the same campus has still further advantages for the probability of success in marriage . In all of these there are elements that apply to boys and girls who have attended neighboring colleges , or between boys and girls who have known each other over a sufficiently long period to be sure of a community of interest to start with . Perhaps none of this need be achieved on a campus at all ; perhaps it is only because all the favoring elements are present under ideal conditions on a coeducational campus , that we find concentrated there , in high light and in large , the results of the combination of these elements . Perhaps , after all , the success of these college-made marriages proves only that the safest marriages are those made between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same social and intellectual classes , who have known each other long enough to be sure of the permanence of their affection and respect , who have common friends and common interests , who speak the same language .  |
