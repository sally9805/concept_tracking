txt Letters from Readers of The Times on Topics in the News MORE INFORMATION SOUGHT Points Regarding Washington 's 750-Mile Itinerary Still Obscure Among the responses received from - my letter to THE TIMES in which I asked information about Washington 's 750-mile itinerary of nineteen days , in which he covered : parts , of the watersheds of the Hudson , the Mohawk , the Oswego and the Susquebanna rivers , two indicate that at some time ( perhaps later in the same year ) Washington was in the valleys of the Connecticut and Walmscock Rivers . The responses indicate that Washington was both at the Tichnor House ? in Bennington , Vt. , and at " Camp Hill " in Wethersfield . Vt. , where on the " Old Crown Point Road , " built from old No. 4 ( Charlestown , N.H. ' to make a shorter route to Albany , he and his party knocked on the door of a house to ask directions . The inquiry was answered by a lady . who was baking cookies . The road directions were given , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Subsequently she learned that it was Washington - who inquired the way and ate her cookies . Since then and to this day that recipe , then called a " rule , " is known as the " Washington cookie Tule . " Officially , Washington is credited as being at West Point on Nov. 14 , 1783 . Here he is reported to have re= snained until , on Nov. 25 , he took possession of New York City as it was evacuated by the British . The Trip to Bennington . Has any one any records , family or official , that the trip to Bennington through New England was made between Nov. 14 and 25 , 1783 ? Or that it was made at any time ? The reason for the visit to the Tichnor House in Bennington , as reached from West Point by going ' through New England , is given as ' follows : In 1775 , to assert against New Vork Vermont 's settlers ' rights to title to 140 townships in an area claimed by New York , Vermont organized as an independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was known as the " New Hampshire Grants . " . New York had long and bitterly disputed the claim of New Hampshire to make these grants . In 1764 the King of England decided that dispute in favor of New York . The New York Governor thereupon ordered the several thousand settlers to buy their land over again from . the owners of the New York title . The settlers , led by Ethan Allen , Seth Warner , Ira Alien and others , rose in insurrection to dispute the second - payment arid the " Green Mountain Boys " came into existence , asserting that their title by occupancy with payment was good against the ? King 's decision . In 1777 Vermont sought admission to the Union , which was denied , because of the protest of New York . New York had not only this disputed land claim on the east , that Was in 1790 to become the State of Vermont , but also , subject to the rights of the Indians , had a claim over all of the territory west of the Allegheny River and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was in 1787 to become the Northwest Territory . In 1779 , George Rogers Clark captured Vincennes . This- military ocWestern dominated New York 's Western claim . He immediately announced that he took possession by conquest in the name of Virginia , against all other claimants , and particularly against the claims of New York . To these two aggressions on her landed expansion expectancies New York replied by act of the Legislature , chapter 38 , passed Feb. 19 , 1780 , which recited the necessity of avoiding State jealousies by adjusting the claims to her vast land expectancies in such a way that all of these lands should reach the possession of the United States , to become the common property of the States , provided that these lands should be shared only by those other States which conveyed to the United States all of their claims to the same area for the same purpose .

New York 's rather small original area was in expectancy of recognizing Vermont as a State and of adjusting Massachusetts 's " ocean to ocean " claims , increased two-thirds more than her area in 1783 , after setting up Vermont as a State . New York also settled Massachusetts 's claims by a compact covering 6,000,000 acres of land west of the pre-emption line in the present area of New York , for which Massachusetts got cash and New York area . How Other States Fared . Connecticut reserved an area in Ohio ; Pennsylvania was provided with an outlet on Lake Erie . Kentucky and Tennessee were confirmed und credited to Virginia 's forbearance in approving these new and vast boundary adjustments .

Washington , Clinton , Schuyler , Phelps and Gorham , Oliver Ellsworth and Vermont 's representatives were most necessary parties to the adjustment of the western boundaries of the thirteen Colonies ant the foundation of the new territorial policy that was to create the Northwest Territory and . to admit the new States of Vermont and Kentucky into the Union .

THE ENERGY OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to support that old : myth that the atom is a possible source of energy ? available to man , unfortunately falls into several errors of logic . He quotes from Heyl 's " New Frontiers of Physics " that : " One gram of matter may disppear as such , giving rise to 9 x 10 " ergs of energy , " which , he says , if the change takes place in one hour , will equal one horse-power . BUt even if that were so , what good is one horse-power in an hour ? We already obtain , and ( practically ) instantaneously , much More than that from one gram of gasoline , exploded as vapor mixed With air . I 'd hate to run a gas station offering that kind of " matter " as fuel for cars in competition with gasoline !

However , there is no evidence that a conversion of matter into energy in this sense is possible or probable . In the above quotation , as in all such writings , search will always disclose some such word as the little " may , " which will permit the writer to deny having made a positive statement . A statement concerning any subject may be so dressed up in quasi-technical jargon as to lend it a factitious appearance of reality out of all proportion to its intrinsic value /or truth . In consequence , I must deny Mr. Rich 's statement that " The actual conversion of matter into energy has been observed and its rate meatured . " It should not be forgotten that all our ideas on atomic structure are-as yet-entirely hypothetical in nature . A. MAERZ . Ridgewood , .. TsessTulsr. 1931 , CAN WE IN JUSTICE CRITICIZE FRANCE FOR ARMS ATTITUDE ? Our Own Peace Record , It Is Held , Is Not All That It Might Be To the Editor of The New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now because of her attitude toward disarmament . Might it not be well for us candidly to examine our own peace record ? Any one who does so will be forced to admit that while we have loet no occasion of proclaiming our love of peace , that it is quite another story when it has come to giving concrete assurance of help in solving world problems . Immediately after the war France , I urged by Great Britain and the United States to reduce her army in accordance with the Versailles Treaty , expressed her willingness to do so if those two nations would promise to come to her assistance in case of unprovoked attack by Germany . England agreed on condition that we took the same step , but we gave a prompt and- unequivocal refusal . Very right and proper , many will say , but nevertheless the chief cause of France 's present attitude . Followed next the League of Nations , from which Russia and America alone among the great powers still stand aloof . The World Court , Too . It will be exactly four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorable conference of international lawyers . who , through endless sessions argued and compromised and yielded point after point in a despairing effort to meet the Senate 's objections to America 's entrance into the World Court . I dare say there has been nothing to equal it since those grand old days when the thelogianis spent most of their waking hours discussing how many angels could stand on the point of a spear and kindred vital if controversial topics . Finally , Mr. Root 's formula was adopted and the end seemed in sight . Four years ago , and President Hoover thought it best not to bring- the matter to the attention of the Senate last January for fear that if he did so the session would be prolonged throughout the Summer ! So America , standing outside both the League and the World Court and feeling perhaps that the world might begin to doubt the validity of her position as the chief lover of peace among the nations , entered into travel/ and brought forth the Kellogg Pact , which every country promptly signed without halting their war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next came the soundest , the most promising plan that has ever been suggested . Yet I dare say that if nine out of ten Americans of average intelligence were asked to explain what it was they could not do so . By now they have probably even forgotten the name by which it was known - the Protocol . For in this country it was never even considered by the powers that be , although because of America 's attitude toward it the hope of any real accomplishment in the - elimination of - war , for many generations to come was finally destroyed . Teeth in the Protocol . What was the protocol and in what essential particular did it differ from any other international-pact for the preservation of peace ? As every one knows the great difficulty in all international crises when war threatens has always been to fix the blame as between the belligerents . Each proclaims that he has been attacked and is striking only in self-defense . Now , the protocol stipulated that all signatories must agree to arbitrate their differences either before the World Court or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party to a quarrel refused to arbitrate he should automatically Pe adjudged the aggressor and-now we come to the real gist Of the matter-all the other signatories pledged themselves not to trade with him ! In other words , he was to be subjected to an international boycott until such time . as he should agree to come into court with his case . France , Italy , Germany , Great Britain signified their willingness to sign this agreement . But when the idea was put up to us , what was our answer ? Without an " if " or a qualifying " but , " America replied that she reserved her right at all times and under all circumstances to trade with whomever she chose . And the goose was cooked . Why ? Because Great Britain at once said that it was impossible for her to sign with the United States taking this stand , for in the event of our insisting on trading with a nation outlawed by her she would find herself automatically at war with us , which was un-thinkable ! The more one thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more lamentable does our conduct appear . Can any one seriously believe that Austria , in 1914 , would have ref-used to arbitrate her quarrel with Serbia , as was urged by LordsGrey , if by so doing she would have brought down on herself an airtight economic blockade ? Would any nation dare today to face this possibility ? It is too late now for this great plan to be revived , for since that meeting between Briand ante . Stresemann , when it was first suggested , a new factor has arisen in the European situation , menacing , incalculable , and no one is so optimistic as to imagine that she could be brought to sign any such pact or to observe its terms If she did so . Ourselves and Russia . It is a strange and disconcerting fact that heretofore whenever the nations of Europe have tried to get together there have always been two Imponderables in the situation-Russia and the United States : They have found it impossible to calculate in advance the attitude of these two nations in any given emergency . Again- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the whole world was sick of it a sudden breath of optimised crept into the dispatches . Secretary Stimson had actuany , hinted that in the event of a threatened war . America might consent to consult with Europe ! But quickly this audacious suggestion was repudiated . Washington frowned . The pall of futility descended- once more and the delegates dispersed to their homes with one more black mark scored against the United States ! The truth is that until President Hoover 's move for a moratorium the world has waited in vain for a single Word from Washington indicating a change in our policy of international ' isolation . ' With a vigilant eye on our Imaterial profit and loss account and an ear alert to catch every selfish I murmur In any quarter of the land , our national spokesmen have been engaged during the last dozen years In alternately scolding and lecturing Europe , implying that when they , quit acting like naughty children and settle their quarrels ' with which we were in no way concerned , we might Once more play nal/ with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the Chinese- wall of our protective tariff , keeping . a watchful eye , however , to see that they dare to . take no retaliatory measures against ifes We Lost Our Position . At the time ? of Woodrow Wilson 's breakdown , America stood in the very forefront of the civilized world . No - other natibn since the dawn of history had ever possessed such a glorious Opportunity for leadership . We had the wealth , we had the men and the brains , the practical efficiency and a limitless capacity for idealistic enthusiasm . There were two roads open to us-to devote these gifts to the selfish accumulation of ever greater wealth and power or to throw ourselves wholeheartedly into the organization of peace throughout the world . We made our choice and it has brought us and Europe with us to the pass in which we find ourselves today . Perhaps it was necessary that we should suffer before our eyes could be opened and we be forced to realize our responsibilities . As long as we cherished delusions of grandeur and fancied that we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our door in vain . However that may be , the first step has been taken at last and it behooves each one of us now to see to it that our representatives in London and Berlin and Paris are urged forward upon the path of international cooperation and conciliation by our enthusiastic and openly expressed encouragements M.

RAIL DINING CARS BETTER ABROAD Our Railroad Executives Might Study Foreign Systems With Profit To the Editor of The New York Times : The letter of A. E. de Ricqles in THE TIMES is a starting point for a little further discussion of the interesting subject of merchandising transportation . It is transportation that a railroad has to sell and food and drink are made obtainable as a service to render the transportation attractive to the public . Such catering as is done on moving trains is presumably at a lass , so the question is pertinent , How much gross profit should the company try to make ? For . Instance , on the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern Connecticut , by no means a de luxe train , tea is 50 cents . No attempt is made to give the service style . It is just there if you want it . But on the Yankee Clipper , a smart , luxurious , excess-fare train , tea served on an attractive tray with special china appropriate to the Colonial decorations of the coach is served for 30 cents . Does this imply that the higher the charge for transportation , the cheaper the refreshment service ? On that other train also a bottle of ginger ale , which I can buy at a grocery store for $2 a dozen , or 17 cents a bottle , and which the railroad can probably buy for less than that , costs 45 cents . The price seems unreasonably high , other things considered , and rather detracts from the merchandising value of the service . Theory May Be Wrong . Is it not just possible that the roads are Wrong in their theory of dining car service ? Every dining car has a conductor , six or seven waiters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen . In Europe the whole service is handled by two people , with no doubt fewer cooks , as the meals are table d'h  --  te and require neither as much cooking or serving as our a la carte service . The point is that the traveler does not demand and probably does not want the wide choice , that is offered him . He wants a good meal . If the chefs concentrated on one fixed-price dinner it could be and probably would be better than most specially ordered dishes prepared under ordinary din- I ing car kitchen conditions . The reason two men can do all the serving for a earful of diners is because they all begin at the same time and end at the same time . Cutting down the large staff and . cutting out the waste that a la carte service creates would make it possible to serve an excellent luncheon for 75 cents and an equally good dinner for a dollar . The method also has the added advantage of enabling every passenger to remain in his seat until his dinner isn ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , buta man with the training of a maitre d'h  --  tel - goes through the train reserving places for first service , second and third service , allowing three-quarters of an hour for each service . The system has so much to commend it and is to my mind so much better than the one we have that I wonder no move has been made to experiment with it . Perhaps it is because railroads are still run by railroad men , and none of the new ideas that are modernizing and revivifying old industries has yet been able to penetrate . a business which has only just begun to realize that it has anything to sell . EARNEST ELMO CALKINS . New York , July 29 , 1931 . WAGES AND LABOR To the Editor of The New York Times : Messrs . Woll and Green . have frequently said that no reduction of wages will be permitted by the Arnerican Federation of Labor . The man in ' the street can not understand how this is going to work out , and as one of them , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem that if labor , which Is the larger part of the cost of industry , is to remain fixed and prices are to continue to fall , profits must diminish and ultimately vanish . If profits vanish , industry must diminish and . ultimately stop and labor must be discharged instead- of having its wages reduced . Is this in labor 's interest , and is it what either Messrs . Woll and Green or labor itself desires ? HERBERT S. STONEHAM . Ngvs %erica Zuly . ZS , XeS4 EXCEPRTS FROM LETTERS Ills Due To Treaty .

SOLICITUDE FOR THE FARMER His Plight Is Undoubtedly Hard , but Proper Methods Will Help Him To The Editor of The New York Times : The old political ping pong game with the farmer 's plight as the ball is on again . ' The blast from Repre- I sentative Cannon of Missouri issued by the Democratic National Commit- I tee is one of the best shots to date . Mr. Cannon says farm values have dropped from sixty-six billion in 1920 to forty-seven billion in 1930 . Since the Wilson Administration the farmer 's income has dropped from eight to six billion in value . The implication is that if the Democrats had remained in power something different might have happened . Things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States Farm ' Index figure in the book from which Mr. Cannbn got his ammunition shows that farm values in 1930 were 115 , as against the 100 five-year prewar average , 1911-14 . While farm income dropped because of the slump in wheat since 1921 , Cannon 's burst Is a complete dud as far as real farming regions go . The Minneapolis Tribune has pretty well disproved the wheat fallacy in the Northwest . By getting the farmers in Minnesota and the Dakotas and Montana to use business sense in farming , diversify , raise live stock , go into : dairying , instead of risking the year 's work on such a gamble as the annual world wheat price , the farm income in that region was increased more than $95,000,000 a year from 1921 until the slump of 1930 . The average farmer out there had his pay raised $1,679 a year in 1929 as against 1921 . Not Being Ruined . And even in 1930 the farm income in the Northwest was still 34 per cent above 1921 . And 1931 , with its devastating wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to in the end of the Wilson Administration , when the war-time wheat acreages in the Northwest were tremendous . In Minnesota , the " bread basket " of America , wheat is this year and was in 1930 and in 1929 worth hardly a fourth of the chicken harvest , eggs and meat . The dairy industry in the Northwest produced more gold in a year like 1929 than all the gold mines in the world , $410 , - 000,000 . We have some drought conditions in parts of the Dakotas which have precipitated emergency demands for relief . We still have a few fool farmers who must fail before they learn the lesson of business in farming . But by and large the Northwest , almost entirely dependent upon farming , is getting along better this year than the industrial regions of the East . The shrinkage in farm land values is only comparative since the farmer who does not intend to sell is not losing anything if this year 's theoretical market is worse than 1929 . It can not honestly be said the farms of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can he said that the land values , as proved by the United States Farm Index price , were boosted to unreasonable levels by Use war . Such values had to come down , just as munition plant profits and valuations dropped after war was over . With all the trouble of 1930 only 185 farmers went bankrupt cait of 185,000 in Minnesota . North Dakota lost 168 , South Dakota 114 , - and Montana 105 out of 78,050 , 83,138 , and 47,563 total farms , respectively . The South has been pretty consistently Democratic since the Civil War . And its cotton situation varies just as wheat does , whether the President is Republican or Democratic . The farmer who gambles everything on a single cash crop will always be having trouble . It is not a lesson of politics . It 's a lesson of life . A Matter of Values . Merchandise today is still at 134 per cent of its pre-war five-year level of 100 . The June 15 ratio of prices paid by farmers to what farmers get was 68 per cent , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop living . But even that average does not prove anything about the right sort of farming . Because when the different items that enter into the average are broken up it is found that the products of skilled labor on the farm-dairying , truck gardening , fruit , live stock and poultry-hold their prices well up to the merchandise prices . Thus today , or rather on June 15 , as contrasted with cash grains at 67 per cent of the pre-war price , fruits and vegetables were 114 per cent , meats were 91 per cent , dairy prod ! ucts were 85 per cent and poultry 81 ppeerr. ceeennttTand " King Cotton " was 65 Politics can affect agriculture . But politics has not caused the deflation of American war-time farm land values since 1920 . Stopping the war did that . And presumably the Democrats stopped the war since the President was a Democrat . Of course , they let a few - Republican fellows help with the fighting . In the next fourteen months shall hear from a lot more Cannons , Democratic arid Republican . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle the farm problem is out on the farm . The soils can not be fertilized with political hocus-pocus . And what American agriculture needs today is fertilization , diversification and business stabilization . If the right kind of farming is done , the farmer can hold his own elsewhere just as he has done in the great Northwest . DANIEL ROCHFOftD . New York , July 28 , 1931 . PRONUNCIATION VIA THE RADIO Now that the silly season is upon us the annual campaign against radio announcers has begun . The first gun has been fired in the columns of THE NEW YORK Tuns by Charlton Andrews . The time has come for the worm to turn , and to tell the world of radio listeners that it has long been the practice of persons who should know better to create false impressions and false values at the expense of ' radio announcers . These enthusiasts unduly depreciate good work well clone at the expense of men who are not responsible for the frequently ignorant , idiotic and absurd mispronunciations broadcast by independent speakers and artists who , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgatten what they were taught . The work done by the radio announcers on the eastern networks has been done in every respect as well and as clearly , and in every way as correctly , and frequently even more correctly , than the work done by educators or teachers who , alas , too frelquently speak their mother tongue inaccurately . Every day we hear of some university president or other prominent educator denouncing the work done by our university professors as superficial and unintelligent -- the result of curriculums that require too little time , arouse too little enthusiasm , and intrigue the personality of the student too little to I be of actual value , with the result I ' that they make an unwise or stupid use of their time . When a prominent educator describes our famous I educational dentres as " splendid centres of hypocrisy , " he describes a l shocking situation , and this is reflected in business life and frequently , in the columns e the daily press . Some time as ,  - -  s I had occasion to tell a man who had devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b " in Bosporus and Reims . He insisted he knew better , and was told to go and look them up . He did so and corrected the error of his ways .

I say ab ' domen and com ' munal , and have said them for fifty years , because they are right . The change in the position of the stress from the lsecond syllable to the first in these words was noted as long ago as 1876 . Robert Hunter and Charles Annandale noted that position as the correct one in the pronunciation of the English and Scots of their time , and the work of displacing the more formal alternative pronunciations has been going on ever since . The change is In harmony with the practice in English of throwing the stress in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so different from the common run of **38;120;TOOLONG given to dogmatic assertiveness when he writes , " And the first time I harkened , I caught him in a frank mispronunciation , viz. , COMmunal .

Look it up for yourselves , and you will find corn ' munal to be the pronunciation noted as correct by - the Century , the Encyclopedic , the Imperial , the New Standard and the Webster International Dictionaries . Further , it is the pronunciation used , and recommended for use , by eighteen members out of the twenty-five who formed the Standard Dictionary 's advisory committee on disputed pronunciations . None of us can control the mispronunciations of : artists or . guest-speakers who-take part in entertainments any more than we can control the idiosyncrasies of those special guestannouncers who emulate Herr Splutterphus , and some of whom sadly need to study correct pronunciation .

The Summer schools will not be firmly established before Winter schools will be tempting us or for Panama . six mweeksa. in Florida , San Diego I am by no means attempting to paint a Utopia .

It is difficult for one who worships Thoreau as I do to imagine just how he would live today if he were to come back to Walden Pond . Would r he have an inexpensive radio set ? I All we can be sure of is that if he did , he would turn it on but seldom , reserving most of his moments for the harmony of nature , tuningnin only on the finest and best neftch radio offers ; a few choice kernels in a bushel of chaff . Would he enlarge his range from six square miles to sixty , in view of the development of rapid transportation ? Would he be willing to use an old car ? Would he Use a small tractor or an electric washing machine ? What was plain living in his day is impossible today . Even though he owned no radio , he would often be compelled to listen to his neighbor 's .

It should not be difficult to find a person of some literary attainment Willing to make the experiment . May I make a confession ? As a boy , I liked " Swiss Family Robinson " better than I did " Robinson Crusoe " and so today , as a man of family , Thoreauvian isolation could not tempt me . But , in addition to a solitary Thoreau , could we not also have a " Thoreau family " ? That is , a man and his wife and their children living along the same lines .

For millions of us , we are happiest and more carefree at work than at leisure . Loafing is a fine art , one of the most difficult of all for many of us to master . The hard times are forcing us to learn this difficult art at a time when we were not prepared for it . There can be no question in my mind but what one of the essential elements of true culture is the ability to employ and enjoy one 's leisure time to the greatest possible advantage . I should not care to argue the point that if , when the Industrial depression seized us in 1929 , we had the proper cultural background , days of unemployment would be little more than days full of boundless enjoyment . Anxiety would be entirely displaced by levity and light-heartedness. - Did you say that the steel mill where I work has shut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of time for hunting , fishing and reading books I have longed to read for many years .

MUCH IS KNOWN ABOUT SIGN TALK Indian Gesture Language Has Been Subject of Several Books Supplementary to and corrective of Miss Elsie Well 's article in Tiss TIMES on Major Gen. Hugh Lenox Scott 's efforts toward preserving the Indian sign language in motion pictures , it is pertinent to outline the work of his predecessors . Miss Weil gives the impression that General Scott 's labors alone have saved the language of the plains fromInxUnction , whereas his is but the crowning modern expression of the white man 's endeavor to perpetuate not only the beauty and Imagery , but also the usefulness , of this ancient universal American language .

Garrick Mallory produced for the Bureau of Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution two partially illustrated and historically valuable volumes : " Gesture Signs and Signals of the North American Indians " and " Sign Language Among the North American Indians . " In 1880 , too , Captain William Philo Clark , who had been with the army in the Indian country since 1875 , was detailed by his commanding officer to give his attention to the gathering together of a more complete and authoritative collection of sign language than had yet been published . Until his death in 1884 , Captain Clark worked intensively at this duty . In 1885 the results of his research were brought out in a small edition , unillustrated. but admirable for its authenticity . The next significant contribution was Lewis F. Hadley 's " Indian Sign Talk , " published in 1893 and containing several hundred illustrations . Hadley , a missionary in Indian Territory , had already , in 1887 and 1890 , written introductory treatises on " Primary Gestures " and " Sign Talk .

Custer challenges ray statement that General George Armstrong Custer was descended from a Hessian soldier of the Revolution . It may be , as Mr. Custer says , that the Kiisters from whom he descended " were in the country ahead of the Hessians , " but General Custer 's American ancestor was a Hessian soldier of the Revolution . In support of this statement I quote " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Frederick Whitaker . " The name Custer was originally Kiister and the grandfather of Emmanuel Custer was one of those same Hessian officers over whom the Colonists wasted so many curses in the Revolutionary War and who were yet so innocent-of harm and such patient , faithful soldiers . After Burgoyne 's surrender in 1778 many of-the paroled Hessians seized the opportunity to settle in the country they came . to conquer , and among these the grandfather of Emmanuel Custer the General 's father , captivated by the bright eyes of a frontier damsel , captured her in turn with his flaxen hair and sturdy Saxon figure , settled down in Pennsylvania , afterward moving to Maryland .
