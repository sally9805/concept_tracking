A holdout against Hollywood blandishments for two years has been pudding-faced , precocious Orson Welles , 24-year-old actor-manager of Manhattan 's Mercury Theatre . Last week , when young Mr. Welles put his name to a one-picture-a-year contract with RKO , the terms for which he had been holding out were revealed . The terms : he will pick his own pictures , produce them under the Mercury banner ( for RKO release ) , use Broadway instead of Hollywood players , serve as actor , co-author and director , and all without spending more than 18 weeks away from Broadway . First picture-Joseph Conrad 's Heart of Darkness .
