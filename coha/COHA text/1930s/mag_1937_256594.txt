" If we could get 50 gallons of water to a forest fire immediately after we spot it from a watchtower , that would be much more effective than tons of water after the fire has had a two-or three-hour start . " <P> This thought occurred to Acting Superintendent A. B. Everts of the Cleveland National Forest in Southern California . But 50 gallons of water weigh 416 Ib . Hauling that much weight , plus a pump and its power unit , over a mountain trail is slow work . Gasoline pumps are convenient but heavy . Forester Everts hit upon a source of power that is light and cheap as well as convenient . He tried frozen carbon dioxide , " dry ice . " <P> Dry ice does not melt to a liquid but sublimes directly from the solid state to vapor . When this takes place under confinement , the vapor is formed at high pressure. * Everts and two associates designed a power unit consisting of two small tanks containing 25 Ib. each of dry ice . Sublimed , this delivers a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is stepped down by control valves to 250 Ib. before being applied to the water hose . Last week <P> Forester Everts successfully tested an experimental model , returned it to the shop to iron out minor kinks . Before next summer he expects to have several full-size units on duty in the woods . Dry ice costs only 4 per Ib. and one filling provides enough power to empty the water tank ten times . <P> <P> * One cubic inch of dry ice makes 450 cu . in. of gaseous carbon dioxide if the gas is free to expand at atmospheric pressure .
