Policeman Thomas Henry Leary of Cambridge , Mass. , a political clown well above average in his humor , last week wound up his campaign ( " Be Wary of Leary " ) to avoid election as a delegate to the State Democratic Convention ( TIME , Sept. 19 ) , by ringing doorbells at dead of night , begging irate voters not to vote for him . He reported his campaign expenditures : 20 for rotten tomatoes for boys to throw at a " Vote for Leary " sign ; 5 for a false mustache to frighten babies . He vowed , if elected ( which local observers last week predicted he would be ) , to campaign for lifting the old age pension limit from 65 to 150 years ; to abolish all relief projects " so the men can go back to work .
