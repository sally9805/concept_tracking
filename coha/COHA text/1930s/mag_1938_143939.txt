Best-seller lists are compiled each week by the New York Times , New York Herald Tribune and The Publishers ' Weekly . They give a clear picture of U. S. week-to-week buying of new books . But do they give an accurate indication of U. S. literary taste ? Librarians ( who hold that Mark Twain is still the most widely-read U. S. author ) aver that they do not . Publishers of inexpensive reprints are inclined to agree with the librarians . Releasing figures last fortnight on the sale of his Modern Library series ( 95 and $1.25 ) , Publisher Bennett Cerf disclosed that Dostoyevsky 's The Brothers Karamazov is the most popular of the Modern Library 's 257 titles , has sold 120,000 copies in ten years ; that Of Human Bondage and Candide sell widely enough each year to crowd all but the most popular new books . Most surprising figure revealed by Publisher Cerf : in four years a two-volume set of Gibbon 's 150-year-old Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire has sold 50,000 copies , is still going strong .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
