txt The well-balanced viewpoint of the forces behind recurrent international crises , which members of the New England Institute of International Relations are striving to attain in their fortnight 's session , is expected to be most clearly represented in a " town hall symposium " ' in Alumnae Hall on the Wellesley College campus tonight . Norrfutn Thomas , Socialist leader ; Mai . George Fielding Eliot , military expert ; Hans Kohn , Smith College professor , and R. H. Markham , Southeastern European correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor , will join in the de- military assistance of European democracies , by the United States " if necessary . " Major Eliot asked for a clear statement of the speaker 's position on this point . " You say the United States itself is in something of ' a mess ' in its own affairs , " the Major said . " Do you feel that it can best serve democracy by striving to keep its own house in order , or by going to the military assistance of powers in Europe which are well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wish to ? " It was indicated that Mr. Mark- I ham would have more to say on this tonight . In lecturing on Monday night and in discussions since then , Mr. Thomas was unequivocal in his statements on the question . " If war comes to Europe it will not result in victory for either group of belligerents , " he declared " Neither of Clem will be fighting for democracy  --  if we are to speak plainly and face facts . An America out of that war can serve democracy and mankind far better than an America in that war . " Perhaps the greatest contribution to clear thinking on pressing problems at the Institute , It is generally felt , was an afternoon lecture by Dr. Rufus Jones , Chairman of the American Friends Service Committee of Philadelphia . Dr. Jones , who for more than 20 years has been closely associated with the world-wide relief work of that organization , began by outlining the background of Quakerism m order to explain the attitude of those who carry on and support the Committee 's work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on in Germany and elsewhere , on the basis of his journey to that country last fall as a member of a Quaker mission to arrange for bringing Jewish refugees out of Germany . Meaning of Quakerism Quakerism , he declared , is an attitude of life which is shared by many outside the membership of the Society of Friends itself . It might be described , he said , as essentially a determination to live a life expressing Christian love and as a revolt against hypocrisy of every kind and in every quarter . Quakers and their fellow thinkers outside insist that in every man there is some measure of reflection of God , Dr. Jones explained , and in all relations with their fellow men they attempt to give " unswerving obedience to the inner light , expressed in terms of action . " The Service Committee is an example of this " action . " Quakers believe , he " continued , that through beriods of silent meditation , the guidance of this inner light can be recognized . Because of this , the Quaker group in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oIlleiaLs of the Gestapo  --  secret political police  --  before beginning to make arrangements for their planned care of refugees in Germany .
