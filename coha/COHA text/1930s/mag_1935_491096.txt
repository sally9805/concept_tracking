T uE young man was very tired when he returned that night to his temporary quarters.As he ex- pressed it , his right arm felt as if he had just pitched a twelve-inning baseball game , and his back ached like a sore tooth . For some hours , it seemed , he had been engaged in trying to throw some heavy balls of tar over a high stone wall . This had been a matter of honor . He formerly had lived in this walled abode and there had met some charming people . On departing , they had asked him to perform them a slight service . Incidentally , the young man 's name was John Dillinger . The high stone wall was that surrounding the Indiana State Penitentiary , from which he had been free on parole less than a week . Dillinger had left prison burdened by a dual set of promises . There was the warden , to whom he had given his word that he would lead an upright life and hurry home to help support his poor old father . Opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jolly crew of bank robbers , thieves , hijackers and murderers , who had asked him to get some guns and ammunition , seal them in soft tar to cushion their fall , then throw them over the wall ; thus furnishing his old comrades with the weapons to kill a few guards and escape from prison . So Dillinger forgot the warden and began the series of attempts which finally led to a prison break . Clearinghouses for Criminals T " purpose for which Dillinger was freed was that he might reform . To this same purpose , convicts are being released at the rate of about 100 a day throughout America , with such results that some serious consideration of the parole system is highly necessary . Penitentiaries are ceasing to be places of penitence . In some states they amount to little more than clearinghouses where crooks gather until such times as banal gags of sentimentality can hoodwink gullible persons with parole power into sending them back to beloved haunts  --  of crime . Here is an instance : Letters from supposedly reputable citizens told the parole board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , there was repeated reference to " the sacred name of Mother ' " and the fact that she needed her boy . That son in prison was not the only one who called the " poor , dear little woman " Mother . The whole underworld with which she consorts addresses her thus . A unique character , she has made a complete success of rearing a spawn of crime ; her other two sons are bank robbers and murderers , and she takes part in their vocations by providing a hide-out , plus counsel and advice when they need it . Yet it is true that she did need that third son . For one thing , there 's more money in hank robbery if three boys in the family ? are working instead of only two . Also , one of the free sons had recently undergone an extremely painful operation by which he hoped to eliminate his fingerprints . At the time of his brother 's application for parole , he was screaming with agony ; his mother feared the torture would drive him mad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If her third boy could only have come home from prison , he could have acted as a nurse . As it was , Mother had to go out into the cold , cold underworld and hire one . Stone Walls Do Not a Prison Make T HIS is not fiction . It is the true story of a gang which now is being hunted as one of the most desperate outlaw crews in the Middle West . A more enlightening angle is the fact that the plea for freedom was progressing until officials stepped in and protested . Therefore , it is about time that the average citizen knew what really becomes of criminals who are sent to prison . One reads that Harry Daniel Morris was received at Colorado State Penitentiary , August 10 , 1919 , to serve from eight to ten years for burglary . Then , again , there is the item that , four years later , H. H. Hazy went into Iowa State Penitentiary , there to remain for four years . Still further there comes news that in two years more , Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgery , and that shortly afterward Dan Morris was sentenced to Folsom Prison for a maximum of ten years for an attempted murder . This seems confusing until you learn that all these persons are the same Harry Daniel Morris who went to the Colorado prison in 1919 , was paroled , went to Iowa State and was paroled again , only to violate it ; then , after being returned to prison , was arrested three times in different parts of the country before the expiration of his sentence . The only persons today who believe that stone walls do a prison make are law-abiding citizens . The convict knows it is possible for him to be arrested on three ibr four other charges during the time that his original accusers believe him safely tucked away on the primary accusation . Who brings about pardons , commutations and paroles ? According to law , these things are done by governors and duly constituted parole boards . According to practice , however , the true power is all too often influenced by politicians , lawyers , crooks , and oversentimental pseudo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and persistent . The Federal Government , for instance , possesses the most rigid parole requirements in America . Prisoners become eligible for clemency when a third of their term has been served , and attempts are made at strict enforcement , plus efforts at thorough investigation before paroles are granted . Last year there were 8244 individual applications for parole out of a Federal prison population of 12,248 . Of these , 4855 were granted , a total of more than twice the entire Federal prison population of the United States in 1911 , when the Government parole system was inaugurated . In that year , 133 paroles were granted , a percentage of less than one in twenty prisoners . By 1929 this ratio had jumped to one in every ten prisoners . Within the last five years it has increased to the point where more than one out of every three prisoners per population goes out by the parole route . During the fiscal year of 1933 , when 5064 terminated garole eases were handled , it was necessary to issue 350 parole-violator warrants , or nearly 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 60 per cent were charged with new offenses . These , it must be remembered , constitute those who got found out . There are no figures on parolees who went merrily back to their former carefree ways and got away with it . That this can happen is best exemplified in the exhaustive work of Sheldon and Eleanor T. Glueek , who traced the lives of 510 prisoners after they left the Massachusetts Reformatory , their findings forming the basis for a volume called 500 Criminal Careers . Careful investigation brought the conclusion that 80 per cent of these prisoners were not reformed five to fifteen years later , " but went right on committing crimes after their discharge . " However , if the foregoing facts sound disheartening , consider the data from the states , when possible to got it . As a rule , that is rather difficult . Available statistics , however , indicate that about 66 per cent of the releases in California and Michigan are by parole , 70 per cent in Pennsylvania , 76 per cent in Ohio , 83 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 87 per cent in Massachusetts , 89 per cent in Indiana and 98 per cent in Washington . Some of the states follow the Federal system and allow parole after a third of the sentence has been served ; others become interested in freedom after only one-fifth of the term has been worked out , and there are still others which entertain ideas of leniency following a single year of servitude . This practice means that a criminal need only proceed upon a plan of good behavior , and stir up a few friends to front for him , plus a lawyer to make the presentation , thus making even sentences for the more serious offenses interfere but slightly with his freedom . Further , it is self-evident , from what figures are available , that both the theory and practice of parole are being violated . Under the Utopian idea of ending crime by giving freedom , it is argued that the first offender really gets his lesson when he is brought face to face with the law , and that , once shown leniency , he will go forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these representations , parole became an integral part of the American prison system , with opinion united in the belief that a second or third offense indicated a lack of desire for law observance . Therefore , under theory , only first offenders are being freed . This can not be reconciled with the facts . Figures from various states show a parole percentage of from 66 to 98 per cent . However , the Uniform Crime Reports of the United States reveal that it is not possible to parole this many first offenders , since they do not exist . Even including a percentage of municipal-ordinance infractions , only 53 per cent of all persons arrested are having their first experience with the power of the law . Besides , there are too many eases like the recent Washington , D. C. , incident of James ( Buzz ) Donovan . He had been arrested forty-five times in fifteen years , and twice sent to the penitentiary for grand larceny . Also he was twice paroled . Dorrovan'a MAC , however , is only a curtain raiser . Consider a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waco , Texas , in 1930 . The charge was burglary , and he was sentenced to fourteen years in the penitentiary . However , after spending a short time in the county jail , he decided he did n't like it , and escaped . Seven days later he was captured by the police of Middletown , Ohio , and sent hack to Texas , where , this time , he really went to prison , hut not to remain . The jail break evidently was regarded as youthful exuberance . He served only two years of the fourteen-year sentence ; then went free on a parole . A Pardon That Cost Nine Lives T HIS young man had a brother named Marvin . 1 In January , 1930 , this brother was sent to prison for four years on a charge of burglary . A month later he escaped , and remained free until December , 1931 , when heartless officers recaptured him and put him back in a cell . But in one year and three months he , too , was " on the street , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by governor , March 23 , 1933 . " The boys got together in a concerted celebration of their easy liberty . For more than a year their names were on the first pages of every newspaper . Now known as the infamous Barrow brothers , they robbed , pillaged and murdered ; they shot down unarmed citizens , machine-gunned sheriffs and slew policemen from ambush . They robbed a Government arsenal ; they even attacked a prison farm with automatic rifles and freed five convicts . Finally the Barrow brothers were killed , to make a total of nine lives which must be charged to a pardon and a parole , plus a chase which had cost tens upon tens of thousands of dollars . This makes interesting reading of a notation in a recent parole report : " The estimate for supervising a parolee is $46.81 a year , as compared with $435.19 for maintaining him in prison .

And this state has received , for more than two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although , incidentally , the elimination of huge administration costs and the odium of the accusation that the making of relief grants has been used blatantly as a means to political ends , would result from decentralizing aid , the greatest benefit would be that the country would lose its relief-mindedness . Persons seeking aid more readily appreciate the limitations of funds coming from a town , county or state than they do those furnished by a national treasury . I know of one worker who cut her case load from one hundred to ten families and kept it at that level by explaining to them and to new applicants the actual source of the money that they asked for . She appealed to both their pride and to their GO FORTH aiND ( Continued Cynical observers who blame prevailing parole methods for the widespread growth of crime go a bit further than the foregoing figures . They estimate that the entire $435.19 could be saved , plus court and police costs , by not catching crooks at all , and merely turning over the country to the criminal element . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacuous than the persistent arguments of low expense by which parole boards recently have sought to answer all criticism . Prac. tically every report devotes much space to the amount of money being saved the taxpayer . Nothing is said about expenses which occur as a result . of these savings in the many cases like that of Hyman Jacobs . This man started in December , 1918 , in the New York Children 's Court , where he was placed on probation . A month afterward he was sentenced to a year and a half in the Jewish Protectory . The records do not state exactly what happened ; only that he was caught and returned two years later for violation of parole . Again there was quick liberty ; within a year he was free long enough to be sentenced to sixty days for unlawful entry , and in the same year sentenced again to eleven months for a like offense . In 1926 he was received in Sing Sing Prison , to serve five to ten years for third-degree robbery . Evidently this period of incarceration gave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for in June . 1929 , he was given an additional sentence of from one to twenty years for first-degree robbery . So now , having graduated in eleven years from a delinquent to a case-hardened criminal , he was paroled in June , 1932 . Parole in Theory and Practice One reads often in sociological Pamphlets that parole was founded to give a man a chance . This was especially true in the case of Jacobs , except that the police caught him at it  --  and within three months of the parole date . He had moved a step higher in crime , and was convicted of kidnaping and extortion . In January , 1933 , he made the familiar return trip to Sing Sing Prison ; ostensibly to serve a fifteen-year term . But one never knows . By such instances it is possible to realize that the theory and practice of patriotism , and they found that they could get along if they tried .

Those responsible for the administration of aid know that one of the most effective means of reducing the relief roll is honest repeated investigation by efficient and experienced workers . They can teach applicants to realize that their aid does not come from the vague source known as " W ash iw ton " but from the dollars and cents of their fellow citizens who have worked and saved , whose taxes supply their wants . Through constant investigations , education in social responsibility , and the firm but just handling of state as opposed to Government funds , the relief load can be lightened and the attitude of applicants changed . aliN SOME MORE from Pogo 13 ) parole are entirely separate affairs . The truth is that the whole system is so muddled , so sloppily administered that it is almost impossible to learn what happens . According to a report of the National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement , there are only three states which have no parole problems . They are Florida , Mississippi and Virginia , which do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberty The rest of the country is rpon basis highly haphazard . There are twenty states where there is not even a parole board ; freedom is a matter of executive clemency amounting in effect to a pardon . In twelve other states it is treated merely as an incidental item of penal administration ; thus giving prison authorities the power to overrule the intentions of a court in pronouncing sentence . Only fourteen states have agencies specifically to deal with parole . Six of these rely on part-time , unpaid or ex-officio boards , and hence use a single official to select prisoners for release . The possibilities for politics in such a system need not be tabulated . Only the Federal Government , Illinois , Ohio , Massachusetts , Texas and New York have full-time salaried boards , according to the Law Enforcement report from which these figures are taken . Therefore , by scrutinizing a report from New York , where parole is regarded seriously , one may gain a faint idea of what is happening in states where there are few or no investigators , one-man hoards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons plainly under political influence . Of the 2880 Now York prisoners released on parole in 1932 , 750 had been convicted of robbery or attempts , about 650 of grand larceny or attempts , 500 of burglary or attempts , 200 of assault or attempts , and 100 had been convicted of taking human life : the rest were minor offenders . In that year , 120 paroled prisoners were released for deportation , 1095 were declared delinquent , with all the possibilities this condition may encompass , and 184 were released to start serving new sentences . ( Continued on Pogo 831 Cop , CGL.b.rouel MI , . Co . Com 'd . ( Continued /rem Page 811 Regarding the lust . figure , critics of easy liberty insist that once a convict is paroled , only the commission of a new crime can send him back to prison . Sometimes even that is delayed . Witness the case of Abraham Roles , who , after some eight arrests on various charges , finally went to Elmira for five years . This was in 1925 . By 1928 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining on the Elmira sentence , be had been sentenced to six months in New York City Prison for disorderly conduct and , following his release , bad been rearrested for investigation into a homicide , before it was finally decided that he had violated his parole and was returned to Elmira- . All this happened in a state which has a full-time parole bureau , which carefully issues reports on its activities . maintains well-trained investigators and occupies a high parole status . It is easy , therefore , to imagine what goes on in the eighteen states where the only attempt to keep in touch with paroled convicts is by correspondence alone . There a man gets out of prison , goes where he pleases , and then writes letters about what a good boy he intends to be . While he is doing this , he can rob houses , hold up citizens , burglarize banks and even commit murder , as long as he does not make the mistake of getting caught at it . There is no one to cheek the accuracy of the letters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not watched and know they are not watched . There are even two states which reineareerate their paroled prisoners only if they are caught in a new crime which has been committed within the boundaries of those states . Once over the line , parolees can do as they please . Often , too , prisoners are released over the violent protest of those who jailed them . Receatly this writer walked into the office of a Western chief of police , to find him two degrees short of apoplexy . The parole board had asked him if he thought a certain Negro , convicted only a few years before of a sex murder , should be paroled . The chief had written his reply on fireproof paper , following which the board had gone right ahead , freed the Negro and told the chief that the reason therefor was that he could go to a good job outside the state , " where he could have a chance . " When the Public Forgets Sometimes one chance apparently is n't enough . John Pawlak might be thus classified . Pawlak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a maximum sentence which should not have released him until 1937 . However , today , with two years still to go , his record shows two paroles , seven arrests , a three-to-fifteen-year sentence in Ohio State Penitentiary , from which he departed , only to be returned on a second charge and another sentence of from one to fifteen years , and from which , of course , provided it already has n't happened , he will make application for still another parole . The cause of such abortions lies in these factors : Following a man 's conviction , the average citizen forgets all about the case , believing that if the court imposed a ten-year sentence the Prisoner must serve ten years . Witnesses become scattered . The parole report , made out by the police departments in the few states which provide for them , is a terse affair stating that John Jones was caught holding up a citizen , and that he received ten years in prison . Everybody , in fact , forgets about John Jones except John Jones himself  --  and his attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken parole into consideration when preparing for his crime , knowing that even if he is caught lie can , by the proper planning , escape serving most of the imposed sentence . Criminals , it might be added , are fully cognizant of all angles of the parole system . Often , when caught in one state where there are attempts at enforcement of true parole precepts , a crook counts himself lucky if he can confess a slightly worse crime in a less efficient commonwealth . Then he waives extradition and loudly announces that he is going back to take his medicine . The Formula for Freedom This is how it is taken : With the sentence pronounced , with the defense attorney 's plea still echoing , the criminal goes to prison and the complaining witness leaves court , somewhat dismayed by the fact , that he , a law-abiding man , has been the instrument of de-voiding a man of his freedom . The criminal and his lawyer have figured on that also . Time passes . The date for parole eligibility approaches . The lawyer begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services of a politician . He may be an ex-clerk of a criminal court , a legislator , ex-political employee ? anyone , in fact , who can walk into the parole office without first sending in his name . Glancing at the list of parole backers in a recent case of revocation of freedom for a. holdup man of long criminal record , one finds : One liquor dealer , who had been backed by a former political boss for a political position . One secretary of a welfare board . One United States senator . One congressman . Two rabbis . Only one ingredient was lacking in this formula , which appears so regularly as to present almost an unbroken continuity . That is what is known as the " sympathetic element . " For this a mother is necessary or , lacking a female parent , a sister , or invalid brother , or bedridden child . After that comes the minister , the rabbi or the priest . The attorney or parole worker , soon after conviction , gets a minister interested in the prisoner , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard for ministers to understand , but , as a general rule , they are known in the underworld as easy suckers . Good men themselves , they want to believe that other men are somehow good . The criminal counts on them as the simplest of all names to get on his parole petition . Following the preacher conies the name of some allegedly bona-fide person who promises to give work to the convict when liberated . In this regard , the bigger the criminal , the easier it is for him to gain a promise of employment ; any of his crooked but uncaught friends will be glad to oblige . Then the witnesses are approached and given a treatment known as " singing the blues . " They are reminded of the terrible life in prison , the sorrow of the poor old mother , the need for support , the interest of the minister . The complainant finds himself pictured as a Shylock , demanding the last ounce of a pound of flesh . Only the police , if they are free of political domination , remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the law-enforcement agencies with an attitude that almost approaches enmity . So , a man walks free . ? . All this time there has been at the disposal of the parole board as nearly complete a history of the criminal and his associates as it is possible to get . liy referring to it , the parole board probably could learn that the liberty seeker has a record that is anything but savory , and in not-too-rare cases , by checking up the past of his backers , discover that some of them also have violated laws . Many parole boards , however , prefer to proceed upon set sentimentalities . One is that any per-9011 who offers a , convict work must be a man filled with good and humanitarian motives . Another is that men in public office who sign a parole petition do so through an interest in public welfare . Yet the mayor of Milwaukee , in a recent explanation of why his city waa comparatively free of crime , cited the fact that politics had been divorced from crime , pointing out that though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city voted on election day , the criminal element was always energetic . Also , there is the fallacy that every female supplicant for the parole of a loved one is good and pure . Crime statistics show that the average dangerous criminal almost invariably has a female accomplice , who begins to work for a parole the minute her man gets into trouble . The records of the Dillinger mob , the Barker-Karpis gang , I he Nash-Keating-Holden crowd , the Kelly-Bates-Bailey crew of kidnapers , and every other outfit of organized criminals show as many women as men , and some of these are mothers . Incidentally , the Dillinger case gives an insight into the sentimentality even of courts as regards the present-day woman criminal . During the efforts to capture Dillinger , a raid was made on his hide-out at the Little Bohemia Inn near Manitowish , Wisconsin . The bandit gang got away ; during the flight , Lester M. Gillis , known as George ( Baby Face ) Nelson , killed a Federal agent , W. Carter Baum , and wounded two other officers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Feather Three women accomplices of the outlaw crew were captured : Mrs. Edward Crompton , a paramour of Tommy Carroll ; Marie Marion Conforti , the moll of Homer Van Meter , and Mrs. Lester M. Gillis . They were all tried in Federal court and entered pleas of guilty of harboring John Dillinger and other members of his gang . The court sentenced each to eighteen months in a Federal institution , and then , in keeping with what so many courts do when a woman accomplice is concerned , placed the trio on probation . In less than two weeks after this kindly action , Tommy Carroll was shot to death by officers of the Waterloo , Iowa , police department . The woman who fought the officers as they strove to pull her away from his bloody body was Mrs , Edward Crompton . Once free , she had taken the first conveyance that would return her to her outlaw consort . Within the same length of time , it is known that Marie Conforti was in contact with one of the Dillinger gang . As for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Crompton , sought the first method of travel to meet her man , thus violating probation . For those sentimentally inclined , it might be mentioned that she had two children to whom she could have gone . Instead , when seventeen slugs ripped through Baby Face Nelson in the gun battle near Chicago , when Federal agents Samuel Crowley and H. E. Hollis gave their lives that they might rid society of this multiple murderer , Mrs. Lester Gillis lay in the weeds close by , screaming commands to her bandit husband . Then , with the guns of the Federal men silenced by death , it was this probation-favored woman who stole their car , whirled it around , picked up her husband , his companion and their guns , and roared away into the night . To complete the matter , Baby Face himself had been a recipient of mercy on more than one occasion . He began his criminal life by stealing an automobile , for which he was sent to an institution and paroled . He violated the parole and was brought back . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After that , he went in for bigger things  --  bank robbery and murder , The Sympathetic Element Of this same Di/linger gang , there was one member who , whenever possible , gave his mother-in-law a nice vacation by carrying her along , together with his moll , her daughter , when a big job was about to be pulled . It added an element of safety to the getaway ; police , he figured , would not stop a ear containing two women , one of whom was elderly . To embellish further the picture of the all-too-often-true facts of the " sympathetic element " in parole cases , there is the historic example of Shoebox Annie French . Shoebox Annie began the criminal career of hereon , William Donald Mayer , by writing fictitious cheeks and sending the boy out to cash them . When the police caught him , she let him take the fall and then pleaded for his liberty , because she was a mother . At last he was sentenced to a maximum term of nine years in Montana State Prison for stealing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's pleas , he was paroled . The first thing Mayer did was to hurry to Seattle , where he gave a terrific beating to it former paramour whom he blamed for his term in prison . That done , he went home to his dear mother , then living in Anaconda , Montana . Shortly afterward , he lured a man named Ole Larson into the house . Larson never was seen again . but a few days after his disappearance Shoebox Annie forged his name to a 8750 cheek he had possessed and cashed it . Some time later , Mayer brought his former paramour to the house . She , too , disappeared . Jewelry , baggage , furs and underwear were found in the place by the police , who accused Mayer and his mother of having disposed of the body by acid and burning the bones . However , they could not prove it . Following this , the pair went to Pocatello , Idaho , where the mother bootlegged and helped her son in the business of stealing automobiles . The police raided their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a motor-car theft and received a maximum sentence of ten years . Shoebox Annie went to work immediately to procure freedom ( Continued an Page 65 ) ( Continued /ram Page 63 ) for her son . Within two years he had been paroled again . There followed another series of felonies , during which time Mayer caught a maximum sentence of three years in the Colorado State Penitentiary . For a third time , Shoebox Annie set the machinery of sympathy and pleading in motion . For a third time , William Donald Mayer , with a record of innumerable arrests , two prison sentences and at least two mysterious disappearances of human beings to his record , was paroled . It was not until after he and his mother had figured in the alleged but unproved murder of a young naval officer , and had been arrested in an automobile filled with guns , ammunition . and possessions of the dead man , that Mayer was sentenced to life imprisonment as a hatitual criminal and his mother to ten years . Beyond what can be learned about convicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attorneys who work so hard in the cause of freedom . It even happens sometimes that paroled convicts can be used for nefarious purposes . Witness the confession of a doctor in one important . case : This lawyer had not defended me at my trial , but did circulate a petition for my parole . After I got back I met him , and he cautioned me that I was in great danger of being picked up for violation of my parole . I felt that he was doing this to frighten me . I exhibited to him my fingers and said , ' I have done something to prevent being picked up . ' He then said : ' It is possible that will protect you . I am very much interested and I will soon be back with my main contact man , who has a cousin who is doing that same sort of work . ' " That " same sort of work " was the attempted eradication of fingerprints by the use of acid . The confession continued to the effect that the doctor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of attempting to alter their finger tips . Among many other cases which are to be found in easily obtainable records is the instance of an attorney who has been indicted three times by county grand juries , once by a Federal grand Jury , and who is under bond on a charge of fraudulent sale of securities , but who , until he was jailed on still another charge , could continue to circulate petitions by which convicts walked out of prison on parole . . R Tarnished Halo However , such records , although easy of access , are checked only by the more meticulous boards . Otherwise , there seems to be a leaning toward such sentimentality as that exhibited by an attorney to a religiously inclined eonvict-freeing enthusiast : l ' ? . I , like you , believe that it was the hand of God that enabled this young Christian soul to live on . From my experience with the party in question , I can safely tell you that he will rob no banks , but it is his firm intention to travel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . of the Bible . The last conversation I had with him , he told me that it was his intention to give the balance of his life in this world to God , and beyond any doubt , your sweet prayers have had a great . deal to do with this deliverance . " There was one true statement about that letter . The client did not rob any banks . He could n't . His attempt to escape from prison shortly after the writing of this letter ended in the killing of his partner by prison guards and the wounding of himself . His name was Harry Pierpont , an escapee from Indiana Penitentiary , copartner of John Dillinger , and executed last October for the cold-blooded murder of an Ohio sheriff . Incidentally , he , too , was a former parolee . In Again , Out Again According to the last issue of Uniform Crime Reports , a nine months ' check of 250,506 arrest records revealed that 64,990 had been previously convicted , and that 7084 had been arrested while on parole or prior to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In other words , about one out of every thirty persons arrested in this country is theoretically in prison at the time he is picked up by police , and about one out of every eight recidivists is walking the streets before the expiration of the time that was set by the judge for him to remain behind bars . Nor does it happen only once . There is the example of George Washington Barton , a Washington convict , who went to prison four times during the period of ten years for which he was originally sentenced in 1922 . Or that of Edward Barnett , who still could be paroled after a record of some thirty arrests , two penitentiary sentences and one court order that he be hanged . It might be added that he violated his parole . Or Louis Decker , paroled from Nevada State Penitentiary after having served three terms of from two to five years each in Missouri State Penitentiary . And there is Robert Loftus , who got one to ten years in 1916 and was paroled . He also got one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got ten years to life in 1925 and was paroled in plenty of time to be once more sentenced to prison by September 13 , 1933 . Therefore , the main matter for consideration is not a discussion of the parole system , but what is being done with it . The cases cited here are not carefully picked ones ; on the other hand , they are haphazard selections out of the thousands of parole violations by hardened criminals . The tragic part of it all is that by turning loose the old-timer and the deliberate repeater , the parole system threatens the life of the purpose for which it was created  --  hope for the young first offender who is willing to spend the rest of his life in right living to atone for his crime . Newton D. Baker , Secretary of War under President Wilson and now acting as president of the Cleveland Association for Criminal Justice , pointed out in a recent protest against the paroling of a notorious gangster that . " paroles , pardons and commutations of sentence granted criminals with long records of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dangerous Criminals Paroled Incidentally , a. three-year record in the state where Mr. Baker made this protest showed that the parole list included three men who had shot to kill , three who had committed rape , six guilty of manslaughter and forty guilty of murder in the second and first degrees , ordinarily punishable by life imprisonment or execution . It is regrettable that Ohio does not stand alone in such evidences of parole laxity . The files of parole states contain instance after instance of confirmed and dangerous criminals who have been released after serving only a comparatively short percentage of their sentences . There are also many eases like that of Walter .1 . Addison , who started out in 916 by violating a parole in Boston , and who , after repeated arrests , added to his record by being paroled in California . He then returned to Massachusetts , and by 1925 was sentenced to from five to seven years for breaking and entering , only to be facing new charges in 1926 , out again on parole by 1930 and in once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur kidnaping and extortion . The Criminal Flood It all sums up to a concerted effort by criminals to get out of prison and no concerted effort by the public to keep them in . The result is that on an average 70,000 convicts a year are being spewed out of penitentiaries , the majority by the parole route . About this tremendous outpouring there is considerable secrecy . Many parole boards do not even make public the names of released men , no matter how many second , third and even fourth offenders are in the list ; the theory being that they desire to give these reformed individuals a chance in their new world . Often the very police officials who have sent the men to prison do not know they are free until they arrest them on some new charge . And no consideration whatever is given to the possibilities of such developments as happened in the case of Henry Cooeh . Conch , a. forty-year-old second offender , had been freed from Montana State Prison and allowed to wander about the country , apparently at will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house of a rancher who lived near Butte and there went to work . It was a large family , among the children being a fourteen-year-old schoolgirl . Cooch became ill  --  or pretended it . The family cared for him : one of the nurses being that fourteenyear-old girl . So Cooch made persistent love to her , painted the outside world in sunset colors and persuaded her to run away with him . One night she slipped out a back window and they rode away together  --  on horses which Cooch had stolen from the girl 's father . Conch took the girl northward , forcing her to travel only by night and to hide by day , until they had crossed the Canadian border and progressed some distance into the trapping lands north of Regina , in Saskatchewan . During that entire winter , Cooch kept the girl a prisoner in a trapper 's cabin . He refused to allow her to write to friends or family . He beat her . It was not until provincial police caught him in a game violation that the girl was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Salvation Army home . There a baby was born to her . Cooch fought extradition to the United States . Local authorities , balked , sought . the aid of the Federal Government .. White-slave charges were filed against Cooch , and he was brought back , only to be turned over to the state which had accused him of kidnaping . During the ensuing trial , Couch conducted his own defense , browbeating the girl so fiercely during her cross-examination that the jury was delayed four hours in an argument as to whether it should give him only fifty years or ninety-nine . Finally it compromised upon a maximum of sixty . But that was merely the verdict of a jury . And verdicts do n't amount to much any more .
