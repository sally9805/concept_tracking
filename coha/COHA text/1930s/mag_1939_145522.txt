With Generalissimo Francisco Franco 's troops edging nearer to Barcelona , France last week began to jitter over the probability of a Fascist victory on her southern frontier . In the Chamber of Deputies there were shrill demands-mainly from the Left-that France renounce the Spanish non-intervention policy and openly aid the Spanish Loyalists , just as Italy and Germany are openly helping the Rebels . The realistic French General Staff was reported to be contemplating occupying the Island of Minorca and Spanish Morocco if the Italian-backed Rebels win the war . There were scary rumors that the Rebel-held side of the French-Spanish frontier had been fortified . There were predictions that a Mediterranean " Munich , " with Italy the victor and France the loser , was in the offing . <P> Despite the clamor , Premier Edouard Daladier 's Cabinet decided to adhere to strict nonintervention , keep the border sealed , let the Spanish Loyalists sink or swim on their own . All week their boat sank lower in the water . An army man himself , for nearly three years Minister of National Defense ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daladier could scarcely have failed to realize the dangers of letting a puppet of Italy and Germany take over all Spain . It was reported that he wanted to help the Loyalists , but French diplomacy was again stymied , as it had been when Germany rearmed the Rhineland , absorbed Austria and dismembered Czechoslovakia - and for the same reasons . Britain , pressed the French Government not to precipitate matters. * And in France itself opinion was sharply , almost evenly divided between desire to rescue the Spanish Republic and fear of provoking war . <P> Former Premier Leon Blum , originator of nonintervention , denounced his own handiwork in a leisurely Chamber debate , declared that non-intervention should be " reciprocal . " wrote in his newsorgan , Le Populaire , that it was at present " inadmissible and intolerable . " Said Deputy Alfred Margaine , member of Premier Daladier 's own Radical Socialist Party : " We have been duped in the policy of nonintervention . " <P> Most fiery speaker was former Air Minister Pierre Cot , renowned for baiting Adolf Hitler , who contended that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were allowed to hold to the Balearic Islands , hinted that French deputies had been influenced by Nazi anti-Bolshevist propaganda , wound up by describing Germany 's internal weakness . Said M. Cot : " The Hitler regime 's only hope lies in bluff or , at worst , in a short war . Thanks to the excesses of Nazi rule France can now count on ten American workers behind every French soldier . " <P> Opposed to the pro-intervention speakers was onetime Premier Pierre Etienne Flandin , who has made no secret of his fondness for Herr Hitler . He moralized : " The French Government should be able to say to the Spanish people , once the war is ended , ' I have no Spanish blood on my hands . ' "
