 | EVER since reborn Poland assumed the responsibilities of a sovereign State , with the Polish Corridor holding the limelight while a dozen other corridors are ignored , the Polish Republic has largely been considered in the light of a vanished past or a problematical future rather than of a vital and engrossing present . Even before world economic conditions clouded the issue , Poland had made substantial strides toward materializing the air castles its people had cherished for so long . On war-wasted territory stretching over the ancient forest area from marshland to mountains , Poland brought agriculture back beyond pre - war levels . Factories which it found destroyed or idle were rehabilitated . Railway mileage was increased and a uniform gauge adopted , so : hat rails bound Poland together instead , f tearing it apart . President Wilson championed Poland 's aspiration for independence , and the United States Government loaned funds for the purchase of food , clothing , and supplies which were essential in the early stages of national rehabilitation . More densely populated than Pennsylvania , Poland is still an agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the economic independence of its peasants , and the modesty of their needs give it social stability in spite of the rapid growth of urban and industrial life . " Without the sea and the seacoast ( bez morza i Pomorza ' ) , there is no Poland , " has proved a potent slogan . Last summer , at Gdynia , a city of more than 30,000 , so new as to be shown only on the most recent maps , Poland celebrated its first " sea festival " near where General Haller , a fter fighting his way to the Baltic , dropped a ring in its waters to celebrate the union of land and sea . Where eight years ago I waded in deep sand , dodging the wind-shaken , weblike nets , seeking " types " in upended boathalves converted into shelters , or watching women bury potatoes in straw-lined sand pits for the winter , there are city streets and five-story buildings . Gdynia , with a port that can accommodate fifty vessels at a time , now handles more than five million tons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pages 320 , 322 , 323 , and 324 ) . Near-by Danzig , eight times as populous and once one of the great ports of the Hanseatic League ? which in its golden day virtually controlled the trade routes of northern Europe ? far from being wiped out through this new rivalry , now handles eight million tons , four times the pre-war tonnage , and the largest traffic in its history . Among Baltic and North Sea ports , Danzig 's tonnage is exceeded only by that of Hamburg , Bremen , Copenhagen , and Stockholm . The Vistula River system drains most of Poland , and Vistula-bound traffic passes to or through Danzig before reaching the sea . RAILWAY IS KEY TO ECONOMIC FREEDOM But it is Gdynia which gives significance to the " Polish Corridor " foreshadowed in the thirteenth of President Wilson 's famous Fourteen Points . And the new railway from Upper Silesia to the Baltic , avoiding the Free City of Danzig , assures Poland 's economic freedom . France has cooperated in financing the railway , and Swiss financiers extended a loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval base on Polish soil could have been foreseen , but politicians fourteen years ago never dreamed of Gdynia . Now there it is , one of the best-equipped ports on the Baltic , and Polish emigrants to North America embark there , direct from Polish soil , instead of at other European ports which their predecessors once helped make prosperous . During the days when Poland was divided , the trade of the Vistula basin was originally diverted to or through Russian , German , and Austrian lands . Under such conditions , the once rich city of Danzig not only failed to serve the vast region drained by the ubiquitous Vistula across whose mouth it stands , but its own commerce dwindled away . Five-eighths of all Polish trade , moving through the ports of Danzig and Gdynia ,  | creates a north-and-south traffic in the Polish Corridor seven times as heavy as the east-and-west commerce , although much trade between Germany and Soviet Russia is diverted across the corridor and through East Prussia and Lithuania , away from the heart of Poland . PORT A SYMBOL OE POLAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Gdynia , thus providing return loads for coal cars from the south . One ship from New Orleans unloaded 7,350 bales of American cotton in a single clay . Naturally , the Poles hold the Polish Corridor to be essential to their very existence . Mr. Eugene Kwiatkawski , builder of the new port , was cheered loud and long during his address at last summer 's sea festival when he said : " Our ancestors slid not come to this Polish shore either as guests or immigrants ; they did not here establish themselves by the grace or through the protection of anyone ; here we stand on our own soil , rooted in our own past , ofttimes heroic and victorious , sometimes cruel and bitter . Here we will remain and achieve our destiny . " Sheltered from Baltic storms by the sand spit of Hel , Gdynia , although an artificial port , is well protected and capable of almost unlimited expansion . A school for the merchant marine , a huge modern post office , through which all possible foreign mail is routed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are prominent along the shore . Modern machinery is used in transshipping the exports , principally coal , lumber , zinc , bacon , eggs . sugar , and butter , and the imports of foodstuffs , cotton , metals , and machines . To the photographer the Gdynia of toclay is less picturesque than the barren , breezy beach clotted with Kashube fisher folk , and the real treat for eye and lens is Lowicz , color capital of peasant Poland. * Sunday after Sunday I went back there , for no lens hunter was ever tempted by finer promises of photographic game . But autumn had brought its clouds and cold and the bright summer dress had been laid aside . Wrapped in long homespun cloaks , the girls evidently regretted being pictured in anything but their fair-weather finery . To be chosen from the ever-moving ranks of women in spotless kerchiefs , rainbow skirts billowing wide over heavy petticoats and high-laced boots might be an honor , however awkwardly phrased by the eager photographer , but to accept the invitation was to subject oneself to the jollying which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers . There is no lack of cordiality as the bright parade leaves the abbey church . These broad-faced women of the fields gaily smile into the lens so long as they can keep moving and hence not reveal any  | individual vanity concerning their unquestioned attraction . But the color plate is a slow , jealous worker and demands undivided attention . Hans Hildenbrand 's color plates represent skill and infinite patience . Even the summer sun could not give such vivid reflections of peasant splendor were it not for friendliness and tact . PEASANT MAID ADMINISTERS A REGAL REPROOF How well I remember the mistake which ruined one of my days at Lowicz . Iliad a city-bred interpreter , all too conscious of his fancied superiority to country folk . Across the cobbled square came a girl of nineteen , so magnificently beautiful that even broad sleeves and bulky short skirt could not make her look dumpy . Around her neck she wore such amber as the adventurous Phoenicians sought along the far Baltic coasts and her eyes were so frank as to betray my cicerone to our common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should at least have blushed . Instead , he stood ten feet away and called to her , " Hey , you ! C'm on over here and give us a picture ! " These might not have been the words , but they suggest the spirit . No sooner had he spoken than I knew our day was done . I could have censured him , but after the devastating , yet dignified . look that towering damsel gave him , there was little left to censure .  | The force of character of Polish peasant women is well portrayed by Reymont , and I owe one of my own photographs , taken without benefit of a cicerone , to the independence of a spirited maiden , aroused by tactless objection on the part of her swain . Dressed in homespun in which at least a dozen tints were arranged in such stripes as suggest the narrow fields of the poorer peasants , this blonde young woman was a pleasing sight . Her natural self-reliance was seconded by that of a flashing-eyed brunette who evidently felt that the recording of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A circular rainbow quickly formed about our group and when the jealous swain tried to remove his girl from so conspicuous a position , he committed the fault of opposing the force of Slavic womanhood with the authority of mere man . The outcome was inevitable . However little interest these two bucolic beauties had in me , they refused to be humbled before a crowd of witnesses . The brawny peasant , clad in a flat-brimmed hat , broadcloth coat , orange-and-black-striped trousers , and heavy top boots , was quickly ejected , and with keen amusement in their eyes , blonde and brunette turned to me and in unmistakable language invited me to " shoot " ( see page 342 ) . Except on Sundays , Lowicz lacks interest , and my favorite village was the tiny hamlet of Popow , one dusty street flanked by high trees and thatched huts , whose in328 THE NATIONAI , GP , &;  | habitants at first preferred to stare at me through glass . On a second visit I provided myself with chocolate , a great luxury in those days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the friendliest of places ( Color Plates IV , VI ) . Suppose a stranger wandered into your tiny village eager to photograph your home life and children . Speaking a strange language and carrying all sorts of mysterious equipment , he would doubtless arouse more curiosity than cooperation . That is a situation the wandering photographer must frequently face . At Popow a black cat crossed my path . Cats add human interest to many a picture . No child would face the lens , but this white-nosed pussy blinked green eyes at me in utter confidence . So I used the cat as bait , adding chocolate as soon as the youngsters came within reaching distance . When the cat tired of attention a lad of eight or ten captured it , and , little realizing how small a place the cat played in my plans , held it for me while a tow-headed little girl in head-shawl and apron looked on . Seldom do I let anyone touch my camera case , but that young lad quietly adopted me , and so well chosen were the places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that I let him do this proud work , causing him deep but pleasurable embarrassment from time to time by giving him another bit of chocolate . Yes , Popow is another of those welcome oases to which the lone traveler looks back with pleasure . Hospitality was showered upon me in Poland , but that of Popow was the disinterested gift of a black cat ( see illustration , page 339 ) VILLAGE DANCE IS VIVID DRAMA Out in the street , one Sunday , there was a village dance . Bright costumes were worn , but the women had laid aside their laced boots and whirled in the deep dust with bare feet . Reymont , * portraitist of the Lowicz region , vividly pictures its peasant dances : " The musicians had struck up for the greatest performance of all ; and forward now came the dancers , and the trampling of many feet was heard . They crowded thickly , couple close to couple , cheek by jowl , moving ever more swiftly as the dance went on . Capotes flew open and flapped wide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snatch of song burst forth , the girls hummed the burden , da dana , ' and tore on more quickly still , and swayed in measure in the mighty , swirling , headlong rush ! No one could any longer distinguish his neighbor in the throng ; and when the violins burst forth in quick , sharp volleys of clean-cut , separate notes , a hundred feet echoed on the floor at once , a hundred mouths gave tongue , a hundred dancers , seized as by a cyclone , whirled round and round ; and the rustling of capotes , skirts , kerchiefs waving about the room , was like the flight of a flock of many-colored birds . THE GEOGRAPHY OF RHYTHM " Those Cracoviennes , with their frolicsome hop-skip-and-jump measures , and the quick lilt of their clean-cut , tinkling , metallic tunes ; and the terse ditties , full of fun and freedom , with which , like the spangled girdles of the peasantry who made them . they are so brightly studded . " And those Mazurs , long-drawn-out as the paths which streak the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streak ; lowly , yet heaven-kissing ; melancholy and bold , magnificent and somber , stately and fierce ; genial , warlike. full of discordances , like that peasants ' nature , set in battle array , united as a forest and rushing to dance with such joyful clamors and wonderful strength as could attack and overcome ten times their number . " And , oh , those Obertases ! ? short of rhythm , vertiginous , wild and frantic , warlike and amorous , full of excitement mingled with dreamy languor and notes of sorrow ; throbbing with hot blood , brimming over with geniality and kindliness , in a sudden hailstorm ; affectionate voices , darkblue glances , springtime breezes , and fragrant wafts from blossoming orchards , like the song of fields in the young year ; making tears and laughter to burst forth at the same time , and the heart to titter its lay of joy , and the longing soul to go beyond the vast fields around her , beyond the far-off forests , and soar , dreaming , into the world of All Things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' " The stately polonaise , set to music by great composers , is the dance of the aristocracy , of huge country estates , of palace  | floors polished like mirrors for glistening , shoulders and brilliant uniforms . Its tempo is that of manly bow and graceful curtsy rather than the heavy pounding of peasant boots . Just as rainbow-dresses spring from humble thatch-roo fed hamlets circled about Lowicz , so the spirit and gaiety of the citybred Pole springs from the somber background of the Polish capital . THE SOLEMN DIGNITY OF WARSAW Beautified by splendid parks and gardens , furnished with wide avenues and broken by large squares , across which the massive piles of Warszawa ( Warsaw ) rise in solemn dignity , the Polish capital always seemed to me a dull background for the irrepressible Polish spirit ; yet one can still say , as did Napoleon , " Warsaw is always amusing . " Never will I forget the quick cadences and exotic musical intervals of a gypsy band in a gay restaurant not far from Theater Square , but even the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joyous repartee which enliven Warsaw 's restaurants . The aristocratic country life , reminding one of plantation days in our own South , is now rare , but stolid Warsaw is still enlivened by the personal charm of the cultured Pole . Until one has seen the Polish theater he does not realize the variety and beauty of the modern stage . Poland 's romantic poets and dramatists of eighty years ago , such as Adam Mickiewicz , Zygmunt Krasinski , and Juljusz Slowacki , either wrote in exile or were subject to a stifling censorship . True , to the Poles themselves even strictly censored dramas were packed with thrills , for behind innocuous allegories they sensed the rebellion of the Polish spirit against oppression . But with the coming of freedom Polish drama developed a catholicity of interest and dramatic method unsurpassed in modern Europe . " Street Scene , " " Broadway , " and " Anna Christie " have all been admirably presented in Poland , and there is a keen interest in all things American . Partly this is due to the presence of many Poles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days of our Revolution , in which the Poles took a keen interest and in some cases a personal part . To-day one can telephone to Poland from any city in the United States , but in the days of the Thirteen Colonies the American Revolution was physically far away and England ruled the seas . Poland not only observed the Washington Bicentennial in Poland , but also , on May 3 , Polish national holiday and anniversary of the premature Constitution of 1791 , praised by Edmund Burke , Poland issued a 3o-groszy stamp picturing Washington in the center between Kosciuszko and Pulaski . In Washington , set amid the huge new structures flanking Pennsylvania Avenue , Casimir Pulaski , clad in the picturesque uniform of the Polish Hussars , sits astride his spirited mount . In Lafayette Square the statue of Kosciuszko occupies a place comparable to that of Von Steuben , Rochambeau , and Lafayette ( page 340 ) . In most modern cities monuments are taken as a matter of course , but Lafayette Square is distinguished by its four statues of foreign friends of freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it is a huge mound at Krakow , built of the good earth of Poland , brought there in the flowing sleeves and multicolored aprons of countless Polish peasants ( see page 341 ) . * President Hoover 's much-appreciated efforts in Polish relief were memorialized in a modernistic monument in the Polish capital , and a Gutzon Borglum statue of Woodrow Wilson , presented by Ignace Jan Paderewski , was unveiled on July 4 , 1931 , at Poznan ( Posen ) , where the National Exposition occupied a part of Woodrow Wilson Park ( see page 327 ) . Nearly a century and a half after Kosciuszko , officer in Washington 's Army , made his famous crayon sketch of the Battle of Saratoga , American youth , under the leadership of Lieut . Col. Merian C. Cooper , sought a place in the Kosciuszko Squadron , with headquarters at Lwow ( Lemberg ) . On Decoration Day Lwow decorates the graves of Edmund Graves , Arthur H. Kelly , and T. V. McCallum , " American Heroes Who Gave Their Lives for Poland , 1919-1920 , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillar in the Square of the Union-of-Lublin , in Warsaw , had nearly a score of gallant  | American colleagues among those who spread their wings over Poland during the struggle for freedom . The Pole , whose horsemanship is admired throughout the world , has taken to the air with spirit and clash . Captain Orlinski linked Warsaw with Tokyo . Colonel Rayski circled Europe in the air . Lieutenant Szalas , landing before dawn , was killed within sight of the minarets of Baghdad . In an airplane constructed in Poland , Captain Skarzynski and Lieutenant Markiewicz made the tour of Africa in 1931 , and Captain Karpinski flew over many of the scenes of the ancient world in his flight from Warsaw to Istanbul ( Constantinople ) , Baghdad , Tehran , and Kabul , with a return by way of Cairo , Jerusalem , and Aleppo . With seven hundred airplanes and nearly eight thousand flyers , Poland 's military aviation is well advanced , and civil lines centering in Warsaw bring passengers and mail from London , Paris , Berlin , Vienna , Salonika ( Thessalonike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poznan . London is less than twenty-four hours from Warsaw by air , and many corners of Poland are a mere pleasure dash from the capital . In the mid-afternoon one can leave the airdrome at Warsaw and three hours later be bathing , dancing , or listening to the band at Gdynia . During 1932 , when railway service and shipping were interfered with by bad weather , airplanes kept up a service all winter long and maintained a regularity of 93.5 per cent . One can leave Paris before dawn , fly over the Black Forest , look down on Prague , and have a late lunch in the " Paris of Poland . " After a pleasure ride to Lazienki Park ( Color Plate II ) , where a mirrorlike canal occupies the place of the orchestra pit of a sylvan theater , and a splendid play at any of Warsaw 's theaters , he can be off in the morning for the " Paris of the Balkans , " arriving there in time to take part in the fashionable 5-to-7 parade along the streets of Bucharest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following evening can find him back on the Grands  | Boulevards , of whose " croissants , " if the story be true , John Sobieski , Polish savior of Vienna from the Turks , is the godfather , the crescent-shaped roll being the product of a Pole who , because he brought the news of the Turkish flight to Sobieski , was given the concession for Vienna 's first coffeehouse . Monotony is the keynote of Polish geography ; yet in the south there are idyllic mountain retreats of rare beauty . Through the obscure but inspiring Krakow Protocol , Poland and Czechoslovakia agreed to turn the whole Tatry mountain region into one splendid national park , shared between the two lands in somewhat the way that Canada and the United States share the beauty of the Rockies ( see page 342 ) . DEVELOPING NATIONAL , PARKS Our own national parks , notably Yellowstone , have been an inspiration to the Poles , and in their efforts to perpetuate beauty and safeguard picturesque areas they have closely studied our National Park Service . Many forms of wild animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontier ridge , and to the tourist hotels on both sides of the boundary countrywomen bring the same highly flavored wild strawberries ( see Color Plate VII ) . Not so long ago Poland and Czechoslovakia were at grips over Cieszyn ( Teschen ) . Now they work together to preserve in the Carpathians a retreat " for the Benefit and Enjoyment of the People . " The Czarnohora group , a range deeply covered with primeval forest and the home of the Huzuls , is another area reserved as a people 's playground and health resort . Not individuals alone are benefited in the sanitaria of these park lands . National sanity is also served when adjoining nations cooperate in beautifying their common boundary rather than fortifying it . American progress and prosperity have been fostered by ignored State frontiers , while unnatural boundaries , emphasized by political , economic , cultural , or linguistic barriers , are thorns in the flesh of struggling Europe . A buffer park instead of a buffer State is at least original . Poland , which owes its very being to unceasing race loyalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desires to maintain a status quo arrived at when wartime prejudices were still potent . Whether it does so is no longer a problem of words but of deeds . That amazingly versatile Pole , Paderewski , tells the following story : " Once upon a time , somewhere in Utopia perhaps , a large sum of money was offered as a prize for the best description of the elephant . Among the competitors there were a Frenchman , an Englishman , a German , and a Pole . " The Frenchman immediately went to the zoological garden , visited the elephants ' house , made friends with the keeper , invited him to luncheon , took several photographs , and , after repeating the experience a couple of times , began his work . Within a few weeks a brilliant book was ready under the title , ' Les Amours d'Elephant . ' " The Englishman proceeded quite differently . He bought a complete hunter 's outfit and in that sporting attire , provided with excellent rifles , supplied with plenty of ammunition , cartridges , biscuits , Scotch wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India , to the wilderness of Africa , saw thousands of elephants , killed quite a few of them , and upon returning home within six months he wrote a concise , graphic essay , calling it unpretentiously , The Elephant . ' " The efficient German acted more thoroughly . He started on a long , extensive journey , visiting all the most renowned libraries of Europe . He read every book , studied every pamphlet , examined every document pertaining to the huge animal , and , after several years of that conscientious work , produced two big volumes under the name , An Introduction to a Monograph on the Elephant . ' " As to the Pole , he wrote his book almost as rapidly as the Frenchman . Its title was , The Elephant and the Polish Question . ' " The " Polish Question " has been supplanted by Poland , living land of the persistent Poles .
