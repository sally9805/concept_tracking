west of the Mississippi Mr. Edward B. Jones , a business man retired by the depression , is sitting behind his steering wheel , watching the endless ribbon of concrete feed itself into the front of his car . Farms , gas stations , billboards fly by him , with a slightly depressing effect ; for Mr. Jones knows that the farms produce too much , that the billboards advertise things that people have already bought more of than they should , and that of all the gas-filling stations in the United States one third have no economic justification for their existence . What , Mr. Jones asks himself , has become of the land of opportunity ? Where may a man who has saved a few thousand dollars from the wreck find a new industry , and invest in it ? Is there such a thing in America as a new industry ? Not on this landscape . The monotonous farms and gas stations flash by , and out of the tail of his eye Mr. Jones reads a redand-black roadside sign that says , cryptically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been done and overdone , there is no new industry anywhere . . . . Another red and black sign flashes by " One Hundred Showers . " .. . Nothing but a change in American habits will breed a really new industry . .. . Mr. Jones yawns . The sun is low . He has driven five hundred miles since morning . Thered-and-black signs are evenly spaced along the road . The next one says , " El Pomar ? One Mile . " .. . Perhaps the depression will change American habits , and with enforced simplicity of tastes a new industry will be born . Suddenly Mr. Jones and his car whizz by what seems like a village , strangely neat and white in the sunset . His mind records the words over a large central building ? " El Pomar Tourist Court . " Seventy miles to the next town and the nearest hotel . Got to sleep somewhere . Reluctantly Mr. Jones 's lower centers , drugged by mileage , obey his intellect and apply the brakes . . . . Might as well try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs up . But it is n't a dump . Clean gravel , framed in whitewashed stones . Nine gas pumps colored like the spectrum . Two attendants in blue dusters , with " El Pomar " blazoned in red across their chests , seize Mr. Jones with their smiles and drag him and his suitcase into a spick and span office . " Just for to-night ? All our cabins have showers . . . two dollars . . . cabin with garage attached , three dollars ? or you can leave your car outdoors . It sure wo n't rain to-night . " Mr. Jones signs a guest book , follows the attendant past an unbelievably long row of glistening shingled cottages . A door is opened ; Mr. Jones fumbles in his pocket . " We do n't take tips here , sir . . . . Do you wish your car serviced ? Oil and gas ? No charge for the service . " The Yale lock clicks . Mr. Jones blinks . The cabin 's only room is tiny , but the curtains are chintz . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner , a small gas range and an icebox . Through a narrow door , noiseless modern plumbing and a gleaming shower bath , where Mr. Jones washes off miles of transcontinental highway . The towels are stamped El Pomar . So is the soap . Above the bed a printed sign : " This is your home while you are here . . . . Please keep all pets on a leash . " In the twilight Mr. Jones walks toward the main building , past what seem to him a thousand identical cabins lined up like lumps of sugar on a green tablecloth . A cafeteria . Nickeled coffee urns . The El Pomar Blue Plate Special . Feeling better , but in a blur of pleasant weariness , Mr. Jones wanders into the Community House , a room with bare rafters and a mounted deer above a great stone fireplace . A man who looks like a pensioned Pullman conductor is writing post cards at a desk in the corner . Four women in khaki shirts and knickerbockers are playing bridge . In the middle of the polished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio jazz . A pleasant voice greets Mr. Jones : " Find everything to your satisfaction ? " It is the proprietor of the El Pomar Tourist Court . Talk of conditions , of solutions . " Two years ago I was busted . Next season I plan to build twenty cottages more . " Very late , toward ten o'clock , Mr. Jones goes back to his cabin , past what seem to him millions of other cabins whose windows are squares of friendly yellow light . His bed has been turned down . A pitcher of ice water stands on a table . He opens a door . Glistening in the dark , not two feet fromthe bed , is his own car . Both under the same roof . Through the window come the splendor of silent moonlight and wild sweet prairie smells . Mr. Jones stretches out upon what his experienced bulk knows to be the best of beds . In the sharp light of morning Mr. Jones surveys the El Pomar Tourist Court . At eighty-five he gives up counting the cabins . On the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children 's playground , with swings and sandpile . And , out in the prairie , what looks very much like the tee of a first hole . Free orange juice for breakfast . . . . As he presses in the clutch , an attendant wishes him good-by and hands him a copy of the Baxter City Herald , EI Pomar edition . At the end of the next day 's run , Mr. Jones , who is thinking hard ( and no longer quite so mournfully ) about that new American industry he was looking for , keeps his eye peeled for a twin to El Pomar . He passes plenty of Tourist Camps , Overnight Stops , Auto Courts and Ramblers ' Rests , but they have only a few cottages and after El Pomar they all look a little seedy . Again the sun sinks . And again it is miles to the nearest town . So with aching limbs and swimming eyes Mr. Jones pulls up at the U Likum Kamp Kabins , and is told by a bloated woman with octagonal eyeglasses that he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty cents . After locking his car and leaving it in the open , Mr. Jones appraises the U Likum assets ? ten cabins , the oblong architecture of which inevitably brings Chic Sale to his mind . In his own cabin are a bowl and pitcher , an iron bedstead , a cracked mirror , and the comb of a previous guest . Saddened , Mr. Jones goes back to the dingy farmhouse which serves as office and headquarters . While be is trying to swallow a peanut-butter sandwich , a young man and a thin girl with purple lips drive up in a dusty Ford . They want a cabin . " Married ? " asks the proprietress and winks at Mr. Jones when the girl giggles . When they have gone to their cabin she becomes confidential . " Saturday night , during Fair Week , I rented one of the cabins six times over . It 's a free country , so what the hell ! " Mr. Jones , troubled by illicit ghosts and several more tangible visitors , sleeps very badly in his U Likum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forth , up and down over the United States with his eyes and mind open , he would soon realize that the El Pomar and the U Likum and the immense collection of tourist camps , cottages , and cabins between these two extremes represent not only a new industry , but an important change in American ways of living , and are , furthermore , one of the few features of the American landscape which the depression is causing to grow by leaps and bounds . Almost nothing has been written about this industry , and little is accurately known , for it is scattered and , as yet , highly individualistic . Some good guesses have been made as to facts and figures , and if we rely upon them it is because they are not only good guesses but the only ones . There are more than thirty thousand of these tourist cottage establishments in the United States . Since raw digits are not easily digested by the imagination , let us translate this figure into a picture ( rather a horrible picture perhaps ) by saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single transcontinental highway , there would be one of them every two hundred yards from Maine to California . The total investment in them is probably something like a quarter of a billiondollars . They give shelter to about 30,000,000 travellers every year , who can rest their heads upon any one of 450,000 pillows in 300,000 little shacks , cabins or cottages . Over 12 , , 000 of these establishments have ten cottages or more . The bottom price for a night 's rest is seldom below one dollar ; the average is very likely nearer two dollars . Whether as a whole they earn a fair return on their investment is unknown , often even to the owners themselves who , like amateur business men everywhere , erase the original investment from their books and count all cash in the till as clear profit . Until recently as solitary as hot dog stands ( from which many of them were born ) , they have begun to organize here and there into co-operatives , to form associations , and to subscribe to a brisk little monthly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These figures , when one thinks of the naked , often sordid appearance of the average roadside tourist cottages , are surprising . Even more remarkable is the fact that the boom in this kind of accommodation has occurred largely since the depression . Ever since the War Americans in increasing numbers have been climbing into their cars and wandering over the countryside out of sheer restlessness , for the pleasure of seeing a new row of telegraph poles and watching the wheels go round . Years ago most of the automobile travelers , when they were too poor to stop at hotels , took tents and duffel bags with them and camped by the side of the road . Gradually farmers learned to offer them space under the trees and drinking water for a quarter . The tide of the wanderers increased , and Chambers of Commerce , mayors , and alert private citizens began to clear waste land a mile or two out of town and offer something ( though still quite primitive ) a little better than space under the trees . Those were the days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high with pots and pans and tired children and khaki bedding rolls , moved over the roads ; at nightfall , for a dollar or less , they tented on trampled grass , where naked municipal spigots rose from the ground and yesterday 's newspapers rustled in the wind , where the travelers themselves , sitting on running boards , swapped road Iore and boasted of their mileage . There were a thousand such camps in 19e2 , twice as many four years later . By then their character had begun to change . The owners of farmhouses along the highway spruced up guest rooms , even put in a bath , and by the time the Department of Agriculture had sent out a bulletin telling them how to make some extra cash out of guest cabins , the foresighted among them had already built cheerless little shacks , about the size of corn cribs , and no more beautiful . Spontaneously all over the country these shacks multiplied , took on coats of white and green paint , blossomed with curtains , mail-order furniture , plumbing , and electric lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubhouses , golf-courses , and fairly yelled at the passing motorist to stop and sample the No-Knock gas , the chicken dinners , the cheap , wholesome privacy of Rambler 's Rest , Kamp Kozy , Hatch 's Huts , Para Dice , Pop Inn , Kabina Lodge , Slumberland , or Dr. Smith 's Sanitary Tourist Camp . And now there are thirty thousand of them . And more every minute . Why , in these hard times when everything else is shrinking , foreclosing , passing dividends ? The reasons for this special boom in a general frost are very simple . Let us take the producer 's side of it . Suppose you own a hundred-acre farm , and U. S. Highway No. 50 runs straight through it . If you are an average farmer it may havetaken you some years , and a big drop in the price of crops , to show you that the narrow highway is worth more to you than all your acres . When wheat went below a dollar you succumbed and put in a gas-filling station ? pin money , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal . Then , when it became more expensive to raise crops than not to raise them at all , you added , to the gas pumps , to the jellied apples and home-made pie stand , a couple of overnight cabins , and furnished them for a hundred dollars apiece ? plus your own hard work with saw and hammer . They paid for themselves in two months . During the winter you built five more . The story was repeated . The following year you blew in all your earnings , your savings , and some borrowed money ; you built bigger and better cabins , modernized them , turned the farmhouse kitchen into a sort of cafeteria , and let your acres run to weeds . The money trickles steadily in and rolls in during the summer . Your overhead is low . Your wife does the cooking , your daughter makes the beds , your son tends the gas pumps . The food , for yourself and your guests , all comes off the farm . And there is a world of difference between selling corn by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cob . You have invested in your own property , in something within the range of your own vision , instead of those fool stocks and bonds that keep on going down . There 's gold in them shacks ? so long as the cars keep rolling by . And they are still rolling by . The depression has n't stopped them at all . On the contrary . People who used to travel by train can no longer afford three or four cents a mile . Graduates of our thousand colleges , unable to get jobs , sponge on the family , club together to buy an old Ford , and point its radiator toward the great open spaces . Salaried men who have lost their jobs but saved something ( or often almost nothing ) say good-by to the landlord and take their families off to see the world before it blows up . Farmers who have failed or been dispossessed crank up the last thing which a good American surrenders ? his car ? and push off into a possibly happier nowhere . And then the great army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always yielding to the restless , pioneer , gypsy streak that lies at the bottom of most Americans , roll back and forth , to the Lakes in summer , to California or Florida in the winter , with less reason than ever for settling in one place . And all of them must find some place to eat and sleep . They no longer carry their tents and pans , and camp out , as much as they used to . Those cars padded with khaki bundles are no longer nearly as common as they were . We are not a knapsack , open-air people . We like nature , but we must have our roads straight and smooth , and we want to view the scenery through the windows ( usually closed ) of a two-door sedan . ( Witness the decline of the touring car . ) And the decade just behind us was one in which millions became accustomed to certain elementary luxuries ; hence the rush to those tourist cottages prosperous enough to provide comfortable mattresses , electric refrigerators , and modern plumbing for guests who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army , a large proportion of which is permanently homeless by ill luck or choice , would never patronize the hotels even if there were no tourist cottages . The big hotels are expensive , and in the cities ; these travelers prefer to stop wherever they may be at the end of a day 's drive , and most of them can not afford the hotels anyhow . The smaller , older generaLion of American hotels , the Commercial Houses , the Railroad Hotels down by the switching yards , where lonely drummers chew cigars in fetid lobbies , are so infinitely more dreary than even the second-rate tourist cabins that no motorist who has learned the simplicity and cheapness of Camp Joy or U Wauna Kum Back will ever go near such hotels as these again . In fact , the tourist cottages are rapidly filling a gap in the American scene long noted by those who have found comfort , economy , and charm in the little Gasthiiuser and auberges of Europe . While the tourist cottages are to be found along every main road in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi has seen them at their best . On the Pacific Coast they are an accepted feature of life ; they flourish too in the mountain and some of the Mid-Western States . The South , always a little slow to catch on to anything new , has few of them . And in the East , in spite of their numbers , they are for the most part comparatively small , primitive , ugly , and unambitious . One may get a fair idea of their distribution by States from the official directory of tourist courts and camps of the American Automobile Association , which lists only the better specimens of this mushroom race . Eighty of them in Maine , fewer than that in New York , Massachusetts , Pennsylvania , or any of the Seaboard States until one reaches Florida . They increase in numbers , and in individual size , from Ohio westward to Colorado , and seem to breed like rabbits in Texas , Washington , Oregon , and California ? which is easily tourist-court State number one , with a total of 726 ? several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the Southern States put together . It is natural that California should be the most luxurious State for motorists . The sun shines , the roads are smooth and wide , and there are enough cars in California ? so one of her proud sons has calculated ? to carry all of its inhabitants across the State line before sundown . Therefore California has developed the auto court , the motorist 's hotel ( or as it is sometimes called ? alas ? the " mo-tel " ) to such a high point of size and comfort that at Long Beach may be found the boss tourist court of them all ? the " Venetian Square , " with kitchen , dishes , baths , bedding , linen , and 334 separate cottages , at from one to four dollars a night . IH The rest of the country is slowly but persistently approaching the all-American record set by Venetian Square . And each section is getting there in its own way . The variety of these cottage camps is infinite , and no two are alike . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First , the crude one-family outfit ? the small home-carpentered crop of shacks built by a thrifty or desperate farmer where his acres meet the highway . Such are for transients , who spend one night , pay one dollar , and speed on in the early morning . Second , the more pretentious cottage villages , representing investments of often thirty or forty thousand dollars , which are run as a business rather than for pocket-money , and catch the motorist with promises of privacy and shower baths on the outskirts of a town . Third , the resort cottage camps , for sightseers only , which have sprung up on the edge of our National Parks , along the lakes in deepest Minnesota , wherever mountains , glaciers , Indians , or wild animals have power to pry , for a week or two , the American motorist from the upholstered seat ( F.O.B. Detroit ) he loves so well . Among these must be included the camps and cabins built and run by the Government ? excellent examples , along with the National Parks themselves , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in . And here is one corner of our life where one can not raise again the dismal cry of standardization . The tourist cottages are anything but standardized . The travelers who use them may roll up in the same cars , all exactly alike ; their minds may be filled with boiler-plate ideas , they may all listen to Amos an ' Andy at seven fifteen and brush their teeth by national advertising , but the places where they sleep by the side of the road are the products of individual taste and effort . To farmer Smith or amateur " realtor " Brown no one came along and sold the idea of putting up those cabins ? they were born in his mind , laid out according to his own taste , nailed together often with his own hand ; they are advertised and managed according to his own standards . They may some day be bought up and marshaled into chains and corporations , but at present they are almost the only prospering manifestation , in appearance , initiative , and economics , of that sadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the all-leveling steam roller of commerce , the tourist cabins are equally free from the influence of art . Such traces of it as creep into the design of the cottages are purely local and personal , with astonishing and often diverting results . Before it is too late , someone with a camera and a passion for Americana should motor about the country collecting material for a monograph on the architecture of the tourist camps , courts , cottages of the early 1930 's . Much that he saw would , of course , be drearily sordid and utilitarian ? rows of glorified outhouses painted a blinding white , clapboarded shanties in hollow squares , litters of bathing cabins , telephone booths , rabbit hutches lined up like soldiers on parade . But he would also find innumerable treatments of the log cabin , both florid and severe ; ingenious solutions of the problem , how to put a man and an automobile under the same roof ; gorgeous combinations of lattice , vines , and gasoline pump ; prize specimens of car-barn Moorish ; amazing marriages of Dutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valiant responses to local scenery and history of those who , in the words of one of the camp-court owners , " try to cash in on their geographical assets . " The average tourist court , huddled close to the roadside , with few or no trees , is not as lovely as its owners like to think . Even were they anxious to embellish the landscape , to melt the cabins into the scenery , and hide their rectangular regiments with groves of trees , beauty must effect a compromise with ballyhoo ; for the main object of a tourist camp 's exterior is to shout at the motorist and make him apply his brakes before he has gone past . Once past ? such is the power of the American car to take the bit in its teeth ? the customer is lost to that camp forever . And so , to the chronic disfigurements of our roadsides by billboard advertising , are added , not only the harsh outlines of the multiplying tourist cottages , but the signs which their owners sprinkle along the road many miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners that their signs should have a surface area of at least sixteen feet ; that the sign should " dominate the field of vision , " that the best location is at the turn of a road , that approaches to narrow bridges ? and other places where the driver 's eye and mind are thinking of something else ? should be avoided ; and that " never more than one thought , " or selling point , should be put on each sign . The selling points of the average tourist cottage camp are few and simple ? a clean , cheap place to rest one 's head , plus the possibilities of food . Most of them have progressed beyond the roof-and-pillow stage , however , and offer modern plumbing , showers , the use of kitchens and dishes . A few ? the aristocracy ? are as luxurious and complete as the better-class hotels . The All States Tourist Camp , at Columbia , Missouri , provides , beside essentials , outdoor ovens and a community laundry . The All States at St. Petersburg , Florida is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop , grocery , and meat market . The Angeles Courts , three miles from San Antonio , Texas , gives its patrons maid and porter service , telephone , telegraph , and clothes pressing for not more than two dollars a day . Cottage camps as luxurious as these are still only a handful among the 30,000 , and set a standard of comfort which the small proprietor will spend some years , and some thousands of dollars , in emulating . But such tangible accessories as baths , kitchens , and maids are not always necessary . The tourist , always ready to trade a little comfort for a lot of service or entertainment , can be lured by other attractions . One California camp offers the tourist polo and wild-boar hunting . Another has a playground , where a paid hostess organizes games and keeps the children from going too high on the swings . Most of the cottage camps have gone in for picture post cards of themselves ? which keep travelers busy in the long evenings . And if you wander far enough , you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tourist court 's private pond ( stocked with fish that are not too difficult to catch ) ; with a round of golf on its free course , with archery ( which the cottage owners say is becoming vastly popular ) , with horseshoe pitching ( now more politely known as quoits ) , with dancing on the tennis court at night , with playing bridge , chess , checkers , or assembling thousand-piece jig-saw puzzles in the camp community clubhouse . And some of the camps will even rent you moving picture cameras . And if you should tire of such sports , the more imaginative auto courts , such as Sid 's Red and White Cottages , at Mackinaw City , Michigan , offer you a small-sized museum , containing Sid 's " famous collection of bottles , " a bear trap , an ox yoke , a pewter stein one hundred years old , a muzzle-loading shotgun , and the authenticated , own , personal boxing gloves of Stanley Kctehel himself . At one of these cottage camps turned up a year ago a very pleasant but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at some time in a long , wandering life , in every corner of the United States . The camp now employs him to talk to homesick travelers about their own home towns . He too has usually been there . If they are clever , and can afford to put in modern fixtures , and have the wits to collect famous boxing gloves or hire some talkative Odysseus , the cottage owners make money . But even if they do n't make a fortune they have a pleasant and stimulating life . All America , in course of time , rolls up their little concrete drive and goes to bed in their cabins . Something of the old fellowship of the road is being reborn in these places . The travelers , as well as the owners , enjoy the casual friendships , the brief contacts , the sudden intimacies that dissolve forever at dawn . One may run into anybody at these cottages ? anybody , and all kinds of people . In the three-dollar two-room bungalow and bath is a prosperous New York lawyer , who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new roofs for gypsies . In a cheaper cabin are two salesmen of rayon hosiery , in blue overalls , who have sold their little house in Minneapolis and are seeing America first . At dinnertime they rub elbows with husky truck drivers , who sleep in the seventy-five cent cabins . Camping under the trees , at fifty cents per car , are some young high school students who have no particular reason to stay at home . And if one gets up very early in the morning one can sec , coming out of a barn at the edge of the cabin settlement , a half-dozen bronzed , ragged figures who have paid a dime ( or nothing ) for their flop and will set out once more on the great road , bumming rides , panhandling , and looking , in a fashion by now fatalistic , for that job -- any job ? that they can never find . With such a motley of travelers , and with so many of the cottage camps struggling for a living and , therefore , asking no questions , unfortunate things happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevails , and when one stays at a tourist court one does not bother to lock things up . Farther east the owners have to be a little more on guard against their guests , and the guests against one another . Cottage linen disappears regularly , even if heavily stenciled with the name of U Pop Inn or Gibson 's Homey Homes . Once in a while travelers chop up the furniture for firewood . Now and then the sheriff drops in , and finds his man . And up and down the land , especially outside of the cities , women who are still too respectable to sign a fake name on a hotel register drive out with temporary mates and enjoy a lawless privacy far superior to anything provided by night boats or the back seat of a sedan . The lowlier cottage camps ask no questions and take in a huge love-nest income ; the better camps are increasingly more careful and require their guests to sign in the guest book , giving the license number of their car . Ordinances and laws are slowly catching up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations , which in some States are , for the tourist cottages , extremely strict . Camp owners complain that the hotel men , smelling a new competition , are behind this legislation , but the wiser hotel men realize that the better class of hotels in the big cities are not threatened , and that the wiser course is not to throttle competition , but to meet it . And so there are many hotels which have learned that the tourist camp 's superiority to the average hotel in cheapness , privacy , convenience , fresh air , and informality must be fought on its own terms , and are building tourist cottages of their own to meet this change in the habits of motorists . Iv This is right , for the tourist cottages have come to stay . The depression has bred millions of wanderers ; when jobs call them back again they will remember the pleasures of simplicity and the open road at a dollar or two a night . We predict that the boom in building these cottages has only begun . Little by little these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized by others ) ; their possibilities as a market will become apparent ; and there will be repeated the old story of our discoveries , booms , and expansions . Unable to make a decent living at something else , thousands of farmers and small business men will clear a space by the roadside and put up rectangular boxes , and make a little money , and add to them ; and of these thousands half , operating in a new field where enthusiasm seems to be more desirable than experience , will overreach themselves and make mistakes and fail , and in the smoke of their failure other thousands will see fire and follow them , and also fail and once in a while succeed . But the hopeless hopes and the gallant failures will build up something on our landscape beside which to-day 's thirty thousand cottages , mo-tels , courts , La Belle Tourist Parks , and Snappy Tourist Camps will seem only occasional punctuation marks .
