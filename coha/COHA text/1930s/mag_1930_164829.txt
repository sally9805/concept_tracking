With the awful persistence of approaching doom , scrawny , scantily garbed but great-souled St. Gandhi trudged on last week , hot-stepping toward the sea ( TIME , March 24 et seq . ) . <P> Sunbeams dancing on the hard road made the barefoot Saint 's steps hot . Eighteen of the 79 disciples who tried to hot-step after him dropped exhausted , were bundled into automobiles by friends of the saint , rushed to the nearest village , weeping because they had " failed the Master . " <P> All India was tense , watching to see if His Majesty 's Government would arrest Mr. Gandhi when he should reach the sea and evaporate a gallon or two of water for a pinch of salt , thus breaking the law which makes salt a British monopoly in India . Pausing at the village of Tresela , St. Gandhi made a speech ( characteristically ) on a topic which had nothing to do with his main object of starting by example his long prepared campaign of " Indian mass civil disobedience . " The subject : Child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Within a few days the law forbidding females under 14 and males under 18 to marry anywhere in British India would go into effect . Mr. Gandhi knew that as he spoke hundreds of children all over India were being married by parents frantically anxious to get their sons and daughters in under the wire . ( Theory : a mature man who marries a babe , aged two , knows that the young spouse is without worldly taint . ) <P> St. Gandhi himself was married at twelve to a girl of twelve . Said he last week : " Oh foolish ones ! Without understanding this law you are busy marrying off little children . Shame , shame ! You are so ignorant , and ignorance is the cause of your slavery to Great Britain . " But though his own child-marriage was bitterly unhappy , he did not specifically condemn the custom , merely called it " ignorant . "
