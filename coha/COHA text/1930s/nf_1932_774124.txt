txt  | beings . Pioneer days , however , offered salvation to man in that they demanded great activity in order to meet frontier life . Meat consists largely of protein , a nutrient which taken in excess of body needs is eliminated through the kidneys . Many of the end products of protein metabolism are sometimes eliminated with difficulty , and if they accumulate in the body the effect may be quite serious . This is especially true with sluggish metabolism and circulation of the blood . With the great bodily activity demanded by nature , however , our forefathers probably suffered very little from the accumulation of nitrogenous products in the body . One would expect the minerals and vitamins which have been found to prevail in milk , vegetables , and fruits to be low in a diet of meat and cereals , but these deficiencies would be overcome to some extent by the fact that the cereal used in the early days contained the whole grain and therefore carried food accessories that we remove today by our methods of refinement . Moreover the home-made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar which takes such an important place in the diet of today would carry some of the essential minerals . The nutritive value of the diet in use in America today is nevertheless superior to that of pioneer days . Education in food habits has had its part in guiding consumption , but the factors largely responsible for the changes that have occurred are economic improvements in production , preservation , and distribution . Cosmopolitanism is a big factor in bringing about familiarity and consequent utilization of the foods of the world .  | Short-time Trends in Food Habits. ? For changes in consumption over a relatively short period of time the statistics based on production , imports , and exports which are published by the United States government are the best source . Several studies of these data are now available , and for a number of foodstuffs annual consumption figures have been calculated for the years since 1890 . Such data compiled by the Department of Agriculture in 1923 show that the consumption of flour in the United States has declined at an increasing rate since 1904 . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption decreased 10 per cent , and in the next 4 years 12 per cent . Meat consumption has declined slightly . The decline in the demand for beef is somewhat greater than it has been for pork products . The use of butter and potatoes has remained about the same during this 40-year period . The demand for milk and sugar has increased . Working , while studying the wheat situation , became interested in the reduced use of this cereal in the United States and undertook to ascertain its cause . He used statistics derived from figures for flour obtained in census enumerations from millers ' production figures , export and import reports , and stock reports based largely on the actual return of stocks at leading points . They showed that wheat flour consumption declined from 1.13 barrels per capita in 1904 to 0.89 barrel in 1923 a decrease of more than 20 per cent , or twice that found by the U. S. Department of Agriculture . The government explained this decline as due to increased purchasing power of the consumer resulting in the utilization of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | and dairy products ; the shift of the population from the country to the city where less bread is eaten ; increased efficiency in the use of flour resulting from the growth of the baking industry and from the use of a higher quality of wheat ; and the use of more fat , milk , and other ingredients in the production of bakery products . Working considered the substitution of other foods as a primary cause of the decreased use of wheat flour and accordingly set out to ascertain what foods were responsible . He found that per capita consumption of meat and lard stood in 1923 about where it was in 1904 ; the use of dairy products , including ice cream , cheese , condensed milk , and butter increased considerably between 1917 and 1923 . But among all the foodstuffs the consumption of sugar showed the most phenomenal growth , increasing as it did from an annual consumption of 70 pounds per capita in 1904 to 107 pounds in 1923 . Corn meal , on the other hand , decreased from 76.5 pounds per capita per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction of 64 per cent in 19 years . Furthermore , Working recognized that the energy need of the country as a whole has decreased during this period . He therefore concludes that the decline in the consumption of wheat flour is caused by increased sugar consumption , a decrease in the energy need of the people , and a tendency to a more diversified diet , especially the use of more expensive foods . He concludes further that the decrease in corn-meal consumption took place largely in the South where it was replaced by wheat flour . If this increased demand in the South had not occurred , the decrease in wheat consumption would have been even greater than it was .  | It is not possible to check the statistics studied by the U. S. Department of Agriculture and by Working with figures of food consumption obtained from the housewife because comparable studies of the diet in the two periods of 1900 ? 1909 and 1920 ? 1929 are not available . An adequate number of investigations were made of the workingman 's diet , however , between 1900 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by these families in the two periods 1900 ? 1909 and 1915 ? 1919 . The latter period includes the years of the World War when a strong conservation campaign was carried on by the government . Although the differences shown between the two periods are doubtless caused in part by the program of the Food Administration and by the high prices of some of these foods during the war period , they are nevertheless in line with the food trends shown by the studies of production , export , and import statistics . According to records collected from workingmen 's families the 12 foods regarded as the bulk of the American diet , namely , beef , pork , other meat , fish , eggs , milk , cheese , butter , lard , wheat flour , sugar , and potatoes , were consumed in such quantities that 12 per cent less energy was derived from them in 1915 ? 1919 than in the period 1900 ? 1909 . This does not mean , however , that there was a decline in the consumption of all these foods . Milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families studied in the later period , in fact , reported the use of almost 40 per cent more milk than those studied earlier . Practically the same amount of wheat flour was used in the two periods , but there was a marked change in the form in which it was purchased . In the earlier period  | 32 per cent was purchased in the form of flour , whereas 10 years later 47 per cent was purchased as bread . Consumption of the other foods was probably lower during the war . period . Measured in energy meat consumption fell off about 35 per cent ; butter and eggs , 9 per cent ; sugar , 14 per cent ; potato consumption , about 26 per cent ; and fish and lard , 17 per cent each . Since the 12 foods furnished 2,700 calories per man per day in 1900 ? 1909 and about 2,400 calories in 1915 ? 1919 , we are probably justified in concluding that fruits , vegetables , and cereals other than wheat took a somewhat more prominent place in the workingman 's diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not strictly comparable . Production , export , and import statistics are for the country as a whole , whereas the records of food consumption , in all probability , represent only about 40 per cent of the total population . Furthermore statistics for the two periods compared also introduce variations . Figures for determining foods available for consumption have gained in accuracy in the 20 years under consideration . More care is taken in getting reliable estimates of production , and the collection of accurate figures for stocks on hand at the end of the crop year is given more serious consideration . Moreover , it is possible that the families included for study in the two periods were not entirely comparable . The two types of data nevertheless indicate a present-day trend in the United States toward reduced cereal consumption with the use of sugar and dairy products on the increase . The consumption of meat remains about the same . Fruit and vegetables are probably in greater demand than formerly .  | The factors leading to these trends in consumption are varied . Decreased activity of man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although many labor-saving devices are found on the American farms today , yet there is no doubt but that the activity and therefore the energy needs of most farm families is greater than that of city families . With the shift in population from the farm to the city the energy needs of the country as a whole is strikingly affected . The rapidity with which this change is taking place is recorded by each new census . In 1880 only 30 per cent of the population of the United States lived in the cities . Twenty years later the urban population made up 40 per cent of the total ; and in the last census ( 1920 ) it was 51 per cent . If the exodus to the city has been at a corresponding rate during the last 10 years the urban population today includes more than 55 per cent of the total . The changes that this brings about in living conditions and activity certainly result in lower energy needs for the United States as a whole . Furthermore , jobs in the city tend to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessened activity and therefore lower energy needs . The change that has taken place in marketing conditions is another factor in bringing about different food habits . The development of facilities for keeping perishable foodstuffs over longer periods of time has been very rapid during recent years . It has not been so very many years since cereals , cured and dried meats , fats , sugar , and some of the root vegetables were about the only foods that could be held over for winter use . Today practically every known foodstuff can be stored for weeks , many of them for months  | before they are used . This means that the season for highly perishable foods is greatly extended , and their use is accordingly increased . The figures given by the U. S. Department of Agriculture for car-lot shipment of foods point out this fact rather forcefully . Car-lot shipments of lettuce , for instance , increased 24 per cent between 1920 and 1927 ; cantaloupes during the same period increased 60 per cent ; cucumbers , 120 per cent ; celery , 70 per cent ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent . Such figures would indicate greatly increased fruit and vegetable consumption . Rapid transportation is necessary for the utilization of such perishable foods . No country in the world has excelled us in breaking down the barriers of space . This fact , together with the development of methods for canning and drying , makes it possible for fruits , vegetables , meat , and milk to be obtainable at all times in every part of the United States . The buying power of the average family has probably increased during the last 30 years and this has also been a factor in changing our food habits . Cereals form one of the cheapest sources of food . Studies of food consumption as influenced by income and population have shown that as the standard of living is forced down the diet tends to become more and more limited to the use of cereals . With increasing buying power man tends to diversify his diet . Education in all probability has played its part in the change . As experiments in nutrition progress the importance of milk , vegetables , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to educational campaigns designed to increase the use of these foods , and there can be no doubt but that they are responsible in part for the present-day trends toward reduced wheat and  | meat consumption and an increasing use of milk anvil vegetables .  | COST OF THE AMERICAN DIET In a book devoted to the economics of food consumption one would expect the factors pertaining to the cost of a diet and its importance in the total cost of living to be given first place . This is not done in the present study . Welfare is given first consideration here because it is not possible to evaluate the amount spent for food until its value in terms of welfare has been thoroughly established . To know , for instance , that in the United States the average man spends about $35 per year for milk has little meaning . Its place in the total diet and its contribution to the nutrients essential for health and well-being must be taken into consideration in deciding whether the man acts in his own best interests in this expenditure . Evaluation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States in the preceding chapters . These include energy , protein , calcium , phosphorus , iron , and the vitamins . From the evidence the conclusion that the diet , on the whole , is adequate to meet the nutritive needs of the American people seems justified . The food constituents most likely to be supplied in inadequate amounts are energy , iron , and probably some of the vitamins . Moreover , we have found that differences in food habits lead to differences in dietary values . The average diet of the workingman 's family is deficient in most of the essential food constituents , whereas the  | farm diet is more than adequate in most respects . The diet of the westerner more nearly meets his needs than does that of the easterner . Generalizations such as these are incomplete ; an accurate comparison of food habits is difficult because of the complexities involved . A diet is made up of 50 or more foodstuffs yielding varying amounts of 20 known food constituents essential for life and health . Analysis of two diets may show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects except protein and calcium . One , according to our nutritive standards , has an excess of protein and an insufficient amount of calcium , while the other shows a lack of protein and an excess of calcium . Who can say which is the better diet ? This is an ever recurring question which can not be answered until the relative value of the various nutrients in the welfare of mankind is known . Also until suitable weight can be assigned to each the comparison of diets in their entirety is impossible . Such a method of evaluating nutrients especially desirable when one approaches a study of tiro cost of a diet or a comparison of the costs of various , ) foodstuffs . All that is possible today in considering the question is to determine how much is spent and what it yields in the way of nutrients . Variations due to occupation and changes over a period of time may be ascertained . The proportion of the total budget spent by various income and occupational groups for food is also ascertainable and is of importance in indicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for evaluating and comparing the cost of foodstuffs in terms of nutrients are described in this chapter .  | The sources that have been drawn on in the previous chapters are again used . The studies , however , cover a period of 36 years , during which time food prices more than doubled . In order to compare figures collected in different years it is necessary to know something about changing price levels and how to adjust them to a common base . The shifting price level is a phenomenon which intrigues economists but is an everlasting annoyance to the consumer . Just when he has adjusted either his income to meet his consumption needs , as he sees them , or his consumption needs to his income , something occurs which forces him to throw his calculations into the discard . For instance , prices may fall to such an extent that he unexpectedly finds himself able to buy a new automobile , or they may rise so that he is unable to buy the necessary bread for his family . The life of the consumer is thus made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ? consideration in any study of costs . The adjustment of such prices to a common base is done through the use of price index numbers . This is a relative value by which the price data for an arbitrarily selected period is taken as 100 , and the data for other periods are expressed as percentages of that base . For instance , the cost of a given quantity of food in 1927 may be $300 ; in 1930 it may be $270 . If the former is expressed as 100 the latter becomes 90 , and interpreted it means that the price level for food is 10 per cent lower in 1930 than in 1927 . The index numbers used here in adjusting food expenditures to a common base are those published by the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for retail prices of food . They are fully  | discussed in Chap . XVII . The year 1927 was chosen by the writer as the base period . Whenever possible allowance has been made for local differences in cost . Cost of the American Diet. ? Forty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning the cost of the American diet . From these it is possible to estimate not only the average amount spent in the entire country but differences in the cost of the average diet of various occupational groups and trends in expenditure as well . A general summary of the data is given in Table XII . It indicates that the average amount spent for raw food in the United States based on 1927 prices is $158 per man per year , or 43.2 cents per day . According to the analysis in Chap . III the food that is supplied is adequate to meet his nutritive needs , and for certain constituents it furnishes more than is actually needed . Although the families represented in Table III are not identical with those in Table XII the samples in both cases are large enough to warrant the conclusion that the average American spends 13.8 cents per 1,000 calories , 47.0 cents per 100 grams of protein , 52.1 cents per gram of calcium , 29.6 cents per gram of phosphorus , and 2.8 cents per milligram of iron . The diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the farm family . The former spends , on the average , 45.5 cents , while the latter spends 40.2 cents per man per day . In terms of nutrients derived from the food consumed the data in Tables III and XII indicate that the workingman spends 15.4 cents and the farm family 11.9 cents for each 1,000 calories ; for every 100 grams of protein the workingman spends 51.6 cents , while the farmer  | spends 43.6 cents . Minerals also cost the workingman more than they do the farmer . For equivalent amounts of calcium the former spends 80 per cent more , for phosphorus 40 per cent more , and for iron 29 per cent more than the latter . For the professional man 's family not much data are available for comparison with the two other occupational groups . Peixotto , however , studied the cost of living in teachers ' families at the University of California , and from 96 records collected by her she concluded that the food consumed by these families averaged $310 per man per year when expressed on the 1927 price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a study of bank employees . The latter showed that families receiving $2,400 to $3,600 spent , on the average , $935 on the same price level . The size of the family is not given in this investigation , but we are probably justified in assuming that it indicates an expenditure comparable with that found by Peixotto . Assuming therefore that $310 covers the amount spent anually by a professional man , on the basis of the figures given in Table III he spends 26.8 cents per 1,000 calories , 88.4 cents per 100 grams of protein , 94.3 cents per gram of calcium , 54.5 cents per gram of phosphorus , and 5.12 cents per milligram of iron . For each of the nutrients the professional man 's family spends considerably more than do the workingman and farmer . The amount spent by individual families in a homogeneous group varies considerably from the average of the group . Like the study of variability made in Chap . IV this is best shown by coefficients of variation . In studies of the amount spent by the housewife for food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In four investigations of farm families it is somewhat lower , averaging 27 per cent . In one study of workingmen 's families it is higher , amounting to 36 per cent . Professional and business men 's families and institutions show approximately the same variation , 30 per cent . This means that in an investigation of the amount spent for food in a homogeneous group two-thirds of the families tend to give reports for expenditure within 30 per cent of the average . That is , if the average food expenditure in the United States amounts to $158.00 the range covered by two-thirds of the families is usually from $110.50 to $205.50 . Although the discussion that has been made of diets would indicate a money expenditure in each case , this is not the true situation . The workingman and professional man purchase practically all of the food consumed by their families , but the average farm furnishes more than half of its family 's food . Studies of the farm diet have been accordingly difficult . In calculating the cost of foods furnished by the farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of production to a price midway between wholesale and retail . A few have used retail prices . The cost figures derived from such studies , which are shown in Table XII , are therefore not strictly comparable with those based on retail prices . The differences caused by this variable are difficult to estimate , but a few studies are available which give an indication of the extent of variation that may be produced . Falconer made a study of the farm products consumed by farm families in Ohio , both amount and value . He priced the foods in two ways , using farm value and the value according to retail prices as reported in Columbus , Ohio . By the latter method the value of the foodstuffs supplied by the farm was 108 per cent above that calculated from farm values . Only fruits , vegetables , cereals , and dairy , pork , and beef products were included by Falconer in this comparison . But since farms usually furnish their occupants considerably more than half of these foods , the difference between the value of the farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent . From unpublished data collected in a study at Cornell University ' it is possible to compare the influence of different methods of pricing on a constant diet . The average diet of 14 farm families was priced in two ways . Information pertaining to the amount paid for the foods that were purchased was obtained from the housewife . Those furnished by the farm were valued in two ways by the cost of production and by retail prices . The results here are very similar to those reported by Falconer , the market value of the foods furnished by the farm being 105 per cent above the cost of production . When the value of the total  | farm diet was calculated by the two methods , that based on retail prices was 50 per cent above that obtained by the combined price method of assigning retail prices to purchased food and cost of production values to foods furnished by the farm . A similar relationship holds when retail and wholesale prices are compared . Foods weighted by the amount usually consumed in the United States and priced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bureau of Labor Statistics show that with moderate fluctuations the cost of the diet is 50 to 60 per cent higher when retail prices are employed . The difference of 20 to 80 per cent between the money value of nutrients furnished by the food consumed by farm and workingmen 's families is therefore apparent rather than real due to differences in method of pricing . Analysis of the nutritive value of the two diets shown in Chap . IV would indicate that farm families depend more on milk , cream , butter , and eggs and less on cereals than workingmen 's families do . Since the former are more expensive than the latter , it is quite probable that the value of the farm family 's diet , if priced throughout on reasonable retail prices , would exceed the workingman 's instead of being valued 12 per cent below . Figures are given in Table XII to show how the money value of the diet is distributed among five food groups not only for the average American but for the average workingman and farmer as well . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent for meat and fish , and the same proportion for dairy products and eggs ; 17 per cent for fruit and vegetables ; 15 per cent for cereals ; and 16 per cent for other foods . The distribution of the food budget of farm and  | workingman 's families points to considerable variation from the average . Correction should of course be made for the differences in the method of pricing foods used in the two types of investigations , but this is impossible . Comparison of the figures as they stand , however , is warranted , since they are relative instead of absolute values . The farm family spends a larger proportion of its food budget for dairy products , eggs , fruits , and vegetables than does the workingman 's family . It also depends less on cereal foods and at the same time spends proportionately less for them . The figures for meat and fish are probably misleading . Since farm families depend on these foods for energy to the same extent as the workingmen 's families it is likely that comparable methods of pricing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going for them in the two groups of families . The Food Administration established during the World War advised that approximately one-fifth of the food budget be spent for each of the five food groups : meat and fish ; milk and cream ; fruit and vegetables ; cereals ; and fat and sugar . According to the average in Table XII , the American family spends somewhat more than 20 per cent of the food budget for meat and fish and less for cereals and for fruits and vegetables . Since butter is included with dairy products instead of other foods an adjustment of this expenditure would probably bring the proportion going for the two groups to about 20 per cent for each . The farm family spends about 20 per cent of its food budget for each of the three groups : meat and fish ; fruit and vegetables ; and fat and sugar ; somewhat more than 20 per cent for milk and cream ; and less for cereal . In the light  | of our nutritional standards this would be a wiser distribution than that shown by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is spent for each of the two groups : meat and fish ; and fats and sugar ; and less than 20 per cent is spent for the two groups : milk and cream ; and fruits and vegetables . Cereals absorb about 20 per cent of the workingman 's food budget . Not only the analysis of nutrients but also that of money value indicates therefore that the farm diet is superior to the workingman 's . The figures that have been discussed give a picture of the money value of various diets current in the United States . They give no idea , however , of the changes that have taken place during recent years . This is shown best by a comparison of index numbers of food prices with those of other commodities . Such a comparison is made in Fig. 3 . It shows the price trends of food and all commodities for the period 1890-1913 . They are derived from wholesale prices . The chart indicates that until 1910 food prices relative to those for the 10-year period 1890 ? 1899 were , on the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1910 they rose somewhat above them . Figure 4 shows the situation for the World War and the readjustment period through the year 1923 , with 1913 as the base . When compared with all commodities food prices are in most of the 11 years lower . As shown in Chaps . VIII and XVII index numbers of retail prices show less fluctuations than those based on wholesale prices , but their trends are similar . Altogether therefore the charts would indicate that during the last 40 years the increase in food prices hag in general lagged somewhat below the general increased price level .  | The conclusion that the cost of the American diet has declined during this period is probably justified . In fact studies of the family diet that have been made since 1900 indicate that the amount spent for food has decreased somewhat . This is no doubt associated with a lower food intake as discussed in Chap . V. Furthermore , the shift from an expensive food like meat to milk , vegetables , and fruits may also have resulted in slightly lower expenditures . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sugar at the expense of wheat flour would presumably have no effect on the cost of the diet . 109 For a long-time trend the data quoted in Chap . V for two professional families give a good picture . As was stated there the record from the earlier period covers the year 1816 ? 1817 ; and that of the later , 1926 ? 1927 . Figure 5 shows that prices of general commodities were comparable in the two periods . Prices of many of the foods , however , were certainly lower 110 years ago . Without making adjustment for possible differences in prices the data given by Woodhouse indicate that the food expenditures of the two families were practically identical , amounting to somewhat over $900 per family . The distribution , however , was quite dissimilar . The family 110 years ago spent a large proportion of its food budget for meat , fish , and cereals with very little going for milk , fruits , and vegetables . The family of today , on the other hand , spent a small proportion of its food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large amount for milk , fruits , and vegetables . Another difference in living habits reflected by these figures is the amount spent in 1926 ? 1927 for meals out . Almost 10 per cent of the total food budget went in this way . In the record of 110 years ago no mention is made of such an expenditure . Proportion of Total Budget Spent for Food. ? The amount spent for food is always of interest . This is  | especially true if at the same time one knows what the expenditure is rendering in the way of welfare . In the case of foods this means consideration of the nutrients purchased . For evaluating standards of living , however , the proportion of the total budget going for food is a more significant figure . The point was first made in 1857 by Engel who in studying consumption trends found that as the income of a family increases a smaller proportion is expended for food . Since costof-living studies made after his time point without exception to the same phenomenon this has come to be regarded as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judging and comparing standards of living . Cost-of-living studies from farm and workingmen 's families agree in showing that on the average 43 per dent of the total expenditure goes for food . The range , however , given by 11 investigations from the farm and 23 from the workingman indicates that selected groups in the United States may vary widely from this average . The farm groups studied showed that the average proportion would vary as much as 12 per cent . The range in the 11 studies was from 37 to 49 per cent . The group of farmers who averaged as much as 49 per cent on food lived on marginal farms in Ohio . Their consumption habits were studied primarily for the purpose of determining what the man living on poor soil was able to purchase or furnish for himself . The families spending only 37 per cent for food , on the other hand , lived on good farms in Iowa . Moreover , the amount spent by the two groups differed considerably , the value of the food consumed by the well-to-do farmers being 55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total value of the  | goods consumed by the former was more than twice as great as that of the latter . In most studies that have been made of farm families , however , from 40 to 45 per cent of the total expenditure went for food . In 23 studies of the cost of living of workingmen 's families a range of 38 to 67 per cent was found as the proportion of the total budget going for food . This again would indicate that families with different incomes are included in the average . Three groups who spent more than 50 per cent on food included mostly foreigners engaged in textile and stockyard industries . The studies were made before 1910 at a time when labor was notoriously badly paid . The studies of workingmen 's families cover a sufficiently long period 1890 ? 1924 ? with enough investigations in each decade to indicate that among these families there has been a steady decrease in the proportion of the budget going for food . Before 1910 an average of 47 per cent of the income was spent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 43 per cent ; and since 1920 , only 39 per cent . It is possible , however , that the changes in income and expenditures indicated by cost-of-living studies are not so great as they seem . The studies made in the two decades 1900 ? 1909 and 1920 ? 1929 show that actual expenditures for food decreased 5 per cent , and income increased about 16 per cent . One would be justified in concluding therefore that real wages had risen considerably during this time . Although they are no doubt higher now than they were early in the century , they have not risen to the extent indicated above . This impression is created rather by the types of families included in the investigations of the two periods . Among the studies made in the first  | decade of the century a larger proportion was carried on by investigators interested in the living conditions in our cities in order to determine the need that existed for assistance from charitable organizations . After 1920 studies were made largely for the purpose of acquiring data which might be used as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the families chosen by the two types of investigators were quite different . The earlier group chose families near the poverty line , whereas the later group included a cross section of industrial families . The professional and business men 's families unquestionably spend a much lower proportion of their income for food than do the farm and workingmen 's families . The 96 professional families studied by Peixotto spent , on the average , only 16 per cent of their income for food . This is probably typical of the group . As Engel pointed out almost 100 years ago the difference shown in the occupational groups is due to differences in income . For an indication of the expansion in the standard of living in the United States in the last 110 years it is interesting to compare the two families studied by Woodhouse . In the earlier period 46 per cent of the total expenditures went for food , whereas the family of today spent only 19 per cent in this way . The difference in this case is not indicative of differences in standards of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two periods . Woodhouse shows in her report that if the amounts spent in 1926 ? 1927 for commodities that were not available in 1816 ? 1817 were added to the expenditures in the earlier period the figure obtained is almost identical with the total spent in 1926 ? 1927 . She concludes :  | Whether , considering the wealth of the country and the state of the arts at the two periods , the professional family in 1926 was , relatively to other social classes , better off than in 1816 is an interesting question for speculation . But there is no doubt that in terms of comforts , conveniences , and luxuries the professional family of today as represented by the Nixons is much better endowed than its counterpart of 100 years ago . In considering the 34 studies of cost of living in which the proportion of the total budget spent for food ranged from 37 to 67 per cent it is important to remember that each study has its own range indicating variability . If this is at all in line with the variability found in nutrients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coefficient of 20 to 30 per cent . For the families spending on the average 40 per cent of their total budget for food the range within which two-thirds of the records would tend to fall would accordingly be 30 to 50 per cent . With the families spending an average of 67 per cent this range would be about 50 to 85 per cent . In such groups as the latter not much is left for other wants , and extreme poverty is indicated . The effect of poverty on the welfare of man is well illustrated by an economic condition occurring in some of our Southern states which is associated with one of the deficiency diseases . Food deficiencies are no doubt associated with many of the diseases of the poor , but none is so strikingly an economic problem as pellagra . It normally occurs in about 2 per cent of the population of the Southern states . After a disaster like the Mississippi flood or a hurricane or after a poor cotton year the incidence of the disease greatly increases . The work of many investigators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conclusion that pellagra is caused by the  | lack of a specific food factor in the diet , called by Goldberger P-P and by others vitamin G or B2 . Pellagra is usually diagnosed by skin manifestations which look like sunburn on the arms , hands , legs , feet , or neck of the patient . They appear early in the spring and are commonly interpreted by the sufferer as sunburn . With the coming of garden stuff on the table the eruptions disappear and do not return again until the winter with its limited diet nears its close . Although the skin manifestation is characteristic of pellagra there are other symptoms which may be of greater seriousness . The alimentary tract becomes badly inflamed with the formation of ulcers in the stomach and duodenum . The disease is particularly devastating to the nervous system and in its later stage often results in insanity . The diet common among families suffering from pellagra consists almost exclusively of corn bread , fat pork , and sirup or molasses foods high in energy value but furnishing little else in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making their own mo ' , sses as they used to do they depend more and more on the corn meal and sirup sold in the stores . Since the commercial forms of these foods are highly refined the diet of the family loses some of the minerals and vitamins which it might otherwise have . When milk , fresh meat , fresh vegetables , yeast , or wheat germ is added to the diet the disease disappears . Pellagra is primarily the result of an economic condition . It is prevalent among the tenant farmers of the South where cotton is the principal crop . In many cases the tenant is discouraged from maintaining a garden and keeping a cow because of the time and  | the land that would be required to care for them . The family thereupon becomes entirely dependent on supplies from the store , and because of the high cost and perishability of milk , fruits , and vegetables , the diet becomes limited , and poor health results . The vicious circle is thus started . The family is unable to produce as efficiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner become dissatisfied . This results in the tenant moving frequently , and his diet and standard of living go down with every move . With many families such serious cases of pellagra occur that they become public charges . If landowners would learn that it pays in crop returns to keep well-nourished families on their land , they would encourage the development of gardens and livestock among their tenants instead of frowning upon them as they do now . Methods of Comparing Money Value of Food. ? It is difficult to arrive at a suitable basis for comparing the money value of foodstuffs . On the basis of price per pound a comparison is eminently unfair because there is usually a big difference in water content . For instance , you may pay 40 cents for a pound of dried apricots or 20 cents for fresh ones . Would you be justified in assuming that dried apricots were therefore twice as expensive as fresh ones ? In reality they would cost about half as much because the weight of the fruit has been reduced at least 75 per cent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some economists compare food costs on the basis of energy yield . Again the method is unfair , for some foods high in energy furnish no other nutrients , whereas other foods are high in nutritive value but supply very little energy . Sugar , for example , costs  | 3.3 cents per 1,000 calories ; and tomatoes , $1.44 . Are tomatoes more than forty times as expensive as sugar ? Fifteen years ago a nutritionist might have answered in the affirmative , but today no one who knows anything about food values would subscribe to such a statement . The importance of minerals and vitamins in animal nutrition is too well recognized to permit an evaluation of food based entirely on energy . Wood and Hopkins in 1916 tried to help the British consumer meet his economic problem more wisely by calculating and publishing the value of the energy and of the protein in the various foods . No attempt was made by them , however , to find a truly composite value . Sherman and Gillett were the first to attempt this . They included , in addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phosphorus , and iron and gave to a list of common foods a " composite value " obtained by scoring the five food constituents . The values used by them are 40 for energy and 15 for each of the four other food factors . The weights were chosen arbitrarily , and there is no way at present of evaluating them . According to their calculations the food groups that have been discussed in these chapters would have the following relative values , based on the 1915 price level : meat and fish , 15.6 ; milk , 5.7 ; fatty foods , 18.5 ; cereals , 5.8 ; sugar and molasses , 8.5 ; vegetables , 7.0 ; and fruits , 17.9 . On this basis meat and fish , fatty foods , and fruits are the expensive foods , whereas milk , cereal , sweets , and vegetables are relatively low in price . Although such a comparison of values may be better than one in which the nutrients are not taken into consideration , yet the weights ascribed by Sherman and Gillett are arbitrary and may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these food constituents in animal nutrition . As was stated above , studies are needed to determine if possible the relative value of the various nutrients so that by the use of suitable weights a food or diet could be evaluated as an entity , instead of considering each nutrient separately as we do now . Moreover , it is desirable that credit be given to a food or diet for its vitamin value , but until these can be stated in quantitative terms it will be difficult to include them in such an evaluation . To determine weights for the nutrients which would actually represent man 's need of each would mean an enormous amount of work and investigation . The interrelationships in nutrition are too involved and too little is known about them to justify a simple solution to the problem . Investigations into food composition , however , which hold the field today will have to yield , and the complex problem of the effect of nutrients en masse and their interrelationships in animal nutrition will have to be met . With a solution to this problem at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of welfare will have more meaning .  | FOOD HABITS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES For the compilation of food-consumption figures for the United States every source yielding data of any value was drawn upon , and from them reliable averages for 12 or 13 foods were established . Moreover , sufficient information pertaining to the total diet used by the average family of America is available to justify a generalization concerning its adequacy to meet the nutritive needs of the nation . The amount spent for food and its place in the total budget are also factors about which much is known . Thus our knowledge of the American diet is based on studies sufficiently comprehensive and varied to justify the establishment of average figures which may be used with assurance . When we turn to the consideration of diets prevalent in foreign countries figures based on a similar amount of evidence are not readily available , and their compilation from the scattered sources which exist would mean a vast amount of research . Certain data nevertheless are obtainable for some of the countries which may be stated in a form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the American diet . These are the weights used in the calculation of food index numbers which are constructed by government or other reliable organizations for the measurement of changes in their cost of living . Practically every country has some kind of index by which it can estimate cost-of-living changes . In some  | cases food alone is used as the criterion ; in others attempts are made to include all of the important commodities that contribute to the cost of living . The list of commodities to be included is set up , and prices representative of the amounts paid by a certain important group or by the population as a whole are obtained . Before constructing these prices into an index each one is weighted according to the importance of the commodity in consumption . The weights used in most countries represent the workingman 's food budget . A total is struck , and the resulting figure is then expressed as a relative in terms of the total cost of the same commodities in another year or period . The latter is commonly regarded as 100 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrease of prices over the base period . In the United States a food index number of retail prices is published monthly by the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics . It is derived from the prices of 43 foods in common use in the American diet . The values used to weight each price were obtained from records of food consumption given by approximately 12,000 workingmen 's families . The figures derived from this study are in harmony with the averages quoted in the preceding chapters for the workingman . For comparison with these it is possible to get consumption figures for the important foodstuffs from nine countries . In some cases weights were derived from careful studies of the diet ; in others food budgets were set up by some one familiar with the food habits of the country . The latter is what would be called a theoretical food budget , and it may not give so true a picture of consumption as an actual study of conditions . Such data nevertheless are  | valuable in showing gross differences in national food habits . In addition to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trends of consumption in some of the other countries . These data are significant in showing relative conditions but have no value as absolutes . Food Consumption in Foreign Countries. ? In practically all countries the basic foods which make up from 75 to 80 per cent of the energy of the American diet find a place . Because the type of meat , cereal , or fat is not the same in all places no attempt is made here to subdivide them according to their sources . The nutrients from these are so similar that no significant error is introduced by grouping them in this way . The other foods for which information is readily available are milk , cheese , eggs , sugar , and potatoes . The food situation as it exists in nine foreign countries is shown in Table XIII . Three continents are represented , including six European countries , namely , Bulgaria , France , Germany , Italy , Sweden , and Switzerland ; Australia ; and two countries in Africa , namely , Algeria and Egypt . The weights used for food index numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this analysis . The figures given in Table XIII for Bulgaria , Germany , Italy , and Algeria are calculated from theoretical budgets based largely on evidence obtained in studies of the diet . Those for Sweden , Switzerland , Australia , and Egypt are derived from weights obtained in actual studies . In reducing the figures to a comparable basis a total diet yielding 3,000 calories per man per day was assumed by the writer , and the part that each of the eight foods plays in supplying energy was calculated and expressed in percentage  | of the whole . The assumption of a diet yielding 3,000 calories may not be warranted . In fact in two countries the eight foods listed here supply slightly more than that amount of energy , leaving no room whatever for other foods which undoubtedly find some place in the diet . The assumption of an absolute from which relative terms may be derived , however , is the fairest way to make a comparison of data in which a number of unavoidable variables occur . Moreover , since the energy needs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , energy is the best factor on which to compare results . In all of the countries except Germany , Italy , and Sweden the basic foods meat , milk , cheese , eggs , cereals , fat , sugar , and potatoes ? yield more than 90 per cent of the energy supplied . Australia and Egypt leave very little room in their diet for foods like fruits and vegetables , since the eight foods listed furnish more energy than a moderately active man needs . In Italy the widest margin is left for such supplements in the diet . The nine countries show great differences in the extent to which they depend on each of these foods . The diet in Bulgaria is predominantly cereal , with fat and meat coming second . In France greater variety prevails . Although more than half of the energy is derived from cereal , yet meat , milk , fat , and potatoes furnish important amounts . Cereals also play an important part in the diets of the two African countries , with fat and meat used largely to supplement . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the workingmen 's families in these countries . Also the probability of the adequacy of a diet made up largely of cereal , fat , and meat might  | justifiably be questioned . In the other European countries and in Australia , although cereal is important , yet it does not form the bulk of the diet . Only 40 to 50 per cent of the energy is supplied by this food . The families of Sweden derive even less of their energy from cereal . Here and in Switzerland 50 per cent or more of the energy is supplied by cereals and milk . These are the only countries that utilize milk to any extent . Meat consumption is , in terms of our standards , low . France and Australia are the only countries where the workingman consumes it in any quantity . Although sugar consumption in these countries is usually low , Australia derives 20.6 per cent of its energy from that source . Potatoes are used to the largest extent in Germany , with Algeria coming second . Altogether the figures in Table XIII would indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few cases would fruit and vegetables supply as much as 10 per cent of the required energy . Since cereals make up such a large part of these diets their adequacy would be greatly influenced by the degree of refinement used in milling . If the cereals were freed as completely from germ and bran as is commonly done in the United States the nutritive value of these foreign diets would be greatly impaired . Among the countries for which food indexes were available four used consumption weights in computing them in which the eight basic foods furnished approximately 4,000 calories per man per day . Such a figure for actual consumption seems impossible , and no attempt therefore was made to reduce the data to a basis comparable with those shown in Table XIII . Since they have value , however , in showing tendencies in food habits the relative importance of each food- stuff in making up the total is presented as indicative of food habits . The countries are Russia , Turkey , Canada , and Chili . Cereals in all cases supply more than 40 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Russia they make up 75 per cent ; and in Turkey , 58 per cent . Fat comes second in importance in Canada and in Turkey . Only one of these countries uses meat to any extent . In Chili it furnishes as much as 10 per cent of the total energy . Milk is , on the whole , of little importance . Chili uses the most , where 6 per cent of the energy comes from this food . Potatoes usually yield about 8 per cent of the energy . Chili uses the most sugar , and Russia the least . While the former derives 14 per cent of its energy from this source , the latter depends on it for less than 3 per cent . A striking feature of the food index for Chili is the inclusion of 22 pounds of cayenne pepper for the use of a family of six over a period of one year . This would amount to an average allowance of a little more than a teaspoonful per man per day ? an almost unbelievable quantity . The Labour Office of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the native working classes of the country . The food prices included in the index are weighted by consumption figures obtained from statistics pertaining to production , exports , and imports . Of the foods listed 85 per cent of the energy is supplied by cereals and legumes ; 7 per cent by sugar ; 4 per cent by meat and milk ; 2 per cent by butter ; and 1 per cent by potatoes . The figures again indicate a high cereal diet augmented chiefly by sugar . Foods from an animal source furnish only 6 per cent of the total .  | The Chinese diet is also an interesting example of the use of large amounts of cereal . The few studies which have been made of the food consumed in that country agree that the total energy supplied by the diet is less than our standard of 3,000 calories per man per day . It usually amounts to about 2,500 calories of which cereals and beans furnish more than 90 per cent . They also supply almost that much of the protein . The remaining diet consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vegetables , fats , and sugars , but altogether vegetable foods make up at least 96 or 97 per cent of the energy , and animal foods not over 3 or 4 per cent . What such a diet means in meeting the nutritive needs of the nation it is difficult to state with assurance . Although protein is furnished in somewhat greater quantity than is required to meet Sherman 's standard of 68 grams per man per day , its quality may be questioned because it comes largely from vegetable sources . Only about 6 per cent comes from meat , fish , milk , and eggs . Studies in protein metabolism have shown that , by and large , animal proteins are more efficient in meeting body needs than vegetable proteins . Protein is built up from 17 or 18 amino acids , most of which are essential for health and proper development . The different proteins show considerable variation in the type and amount of the various amino acids present . In some of them certain of the essential ones are totally lacking . This is especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the animal organism to synthesize the essential amino acids , careful supplementation is needed when these foods make up the bulk of the diet . This is most easily done by the use of milk , meat , fish , and eggs ? foods that take little part in the Chinese diet .  | Moreover it is doubtful if the diet commonly used in China meets the mineral and vitamin needs of the people . In fact in a study by Appleton of anthropometric measurements of 224 Chinese girls the fact is brought out that in practically every age group more than 50 per cent of the children gave a picture of poor nutrition , the primary defect being faulty bone development of the chest . This would point to maladjustment in the calcium and phosphorus content of the diet and to a lack of some of the vitamins . Altogether the picture of foreign diets given by the figures brought together here is one made up largely of cereals supplemented to a limited extent by fats and meat . A few of the countries use enough of the necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world there is a question whether the typical diets are adequate to supply the nutrients needed for normal health and development . Importance of Food in Total Cost of Living. ? In some of the countries the food index by suitable weighting is included with other commodities to make a cost-of-living index . The weight given to food indicates its importance in the total budget . Like the figures given in the preceding chapter these are of interest in determining a standard of living . For five countries in which the index numbers give these data the figures are included in Table XIII . If they may be regarded as a rough indication of the standards of living prevailing in each country we may conclude that Switzerland and Germany maintain the lowest standard and Australia the highest . In Switzerland 57 per cent of the total budget goes for food ; in Australia only 35 per cent goes in this way . Sweden and Egypt are intermediate with 43 and 52 per cent respectively .  | Similar figures are available for Canada , Chili , and India . They cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent is given to food . A theoretical budget is used in Chili as its source of weights for the cost-of-living index number . Here food is given a weight of 42 per cent . The weight given to food in the cost-of-living index number for the native working class of India exceeds all of the others . It amounts to 82 per cent of the total . The food weights used in the construction of cost-ofliving indexes , however , are not infallible indications of the standards of living that prevail in a country . Most indexes include the important commodities in each of the consumption groups , usually listed as food , clothing , rent , fuel and light , and miscellaneous . A few base such indexes on the commodities in only two or three of these groups . In this case the weight given to food would have little meaning . The figures shown here indicate the place of food in the total budget and accordingly justify the conclusion that the standard of living of the native working classes of India is of an exceptionally low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions are not so bad as in India , but even here there is room for improvement . When more than 50 per cent of the income goes for food , as it apparently does in these countries , not much is left for clothing , housing , and the higher things of life . Living conditions for the working class in Sweden , Chili , Australia , and Canada are probably much better . In these countries after the food needed by the family is purchased approximately 60 to 65 per cent of the income is left for other wants . Comparison of American and Foreign Food Habits . The index numbers of retail prices published in the  | various countries are designed primarily to show changes in the purchasing power of the workingman . The prices are weighted according to the importance of each commodity in his standard of living . In other words , the commodities listed and the quantity of each consumed are directly determined by the consumption habits of this group . Moreover the prices chosen for these commodities are obtained from stores patronized largely by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are especially valuable for the working classes . The food index of retail prices published monthly by the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is of the same kind . Although the weights used in constructing this number are not identical with the consumption figures quoted for workingmen 's families in Chap . IV the differences are not great . The weight given to food , however , in constructing a cost-of-living index is 5 per cent below the proportion of the total budget going for food reported in Chap . VI . Since the averages found by the writer seem the more representative figures for this group they are included in Table XIII for comparison with food habits in foreign countries . Whereas in many of the foreign countries for which comparable data are available the eight foods ? meat , milk , cheese , eggs , cereals , fat , sugar , and potatoes ? yield 90 per cent or more of the total energy of the workingman 's diet , in the United States they furnish about 86 per cent . This proportion is somewhat higher than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany and Sweden . The foods yet unaccounted for are largely fruits and vegetables other than potatoes .  | Like the diets in other countries cereals take first place in the energy yield of the American diet . The quantity used here is similar to that found in Germany , Sweden , Australia , and Switzerland and is from 10 to 35 per cent lower than amounts used in the other countries . Fat comes second in importance , with meat following closely , just as it does in most of the countries . With the exception of Australia sugar finds a larger place in the American diet than it does in the other countries . Milk consumption shows wide variation in the various countries . Its use in the United States is similar to that in Germany and France . It is far below that of Sweden and Switzerland . Eggs are used somewhat more freely and cheese less freely in the United States than is usual among workingmen 's families . Potato consumption is relatively low in our country . Taken as a whole the diet of the workingman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other countries . The study made of its nutrients in Chap . IV showed that on the average it is deficient in all of the necessary food constituents except protein . With the exception of the diets used in Sweden and Switzerland the same situation exists in the other countries included in Table XIII . Moreover , in some of the countries it is quite possible that even protein is inadequate either in quantity or in quality . When compared with the diets in Turkey , Canada , and Chili no important differences appear . The diet of the workingman in the United States , however , is no doubt superior to those of Russia , India , and China . The conclusion that the American workingman is no better fed than are those in other countries of a similar industrial culture comes rather as a shock when one  | considers our much valued prosperity which is thought to extend to all classes . In the light of these data it would be interesting to compare the amount spent in each country for the essential foods . Available figures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do show the proportion of the total budget spent for food . According to them food in the United States requires 43 per cent of the total . This is similar to the proportion required in Sweden and Chili . It is about 7 per cent more than is used in Australia and Canada and 10 to 15 per cent less than is required in Egypt , Germany , and Switzerland . The difference between the working classes of the United States and India in this respect is of course enormous . With countries of similar industrial life , however , the standards of living of this group are in all probability of about the same order . Many questions pertaining to the effect of national food habits on the welfare of the people are not included in this chapter . Answers to them are not yet available . Careful studies , however , of the data that lie scattered and uncorrelated in the files of the individual countries would enable one to evaluate with more certainty the diets that prevail . Practically every country has a mass of statistics on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many laboratories have extensive data on the height , weight , and other anthropometric measurements of children of different ages . The typical diets of various occupational groups could be determined from the studies that now exist . Careful analysis and correlation of such data for each country would point to many differences that are impossible to detect in the present study . Some  | evidence is at hand to indicate that a high cereal diet like the one prevailing in China results in poorly nourished children with a tendency toward bony malformation . If this is truly a case of cause and effect , would a thorough study of national diets and physical condition show the point beyond which cereals become detrimental ? not because of any toxic effect , but because the animal due to physiological limitations is unable on a high cereal intake to derive from his diet sufficient amounts of the necessary food constituents ? Cereals are undoubtedly valuable and will always find an important place in the human diet . They are , moreover , relatively cheap . In an economic sense they are certainly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold that place in a nutritional sense . Experiments in nutrition laboratories point the way . Sherman , for instance , has reared rats successfully for many generations on a diet of two-thirds whole wheat and one-third whole milk powder . When the proportion of whole wheat was increased successful nutrition fell off markedly . Several investigators have attempted to determine the effect of diet on the physical well-being of children by means of community studies . These have consisted of the collection of data pertaining to the child 's food habits and to his physical condition . The latter includes such factors as height , weight , condition of the teeth , tonsils , and adenoids . From these data various types of correlation have been set up and attempts made to arrive at conclusions as clear-cut as those that come from nutrition laboratories . Such a method offers possibilities , but the results that have been obtained so far are inconclusive , clouded by many extraneous factors of environment .  | Before progress can be made a vast amount of preliminary research is needed to clarify the factors that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they may be treated quantitatively . In other words , careful methods of analysis must be worked out before social studies of this kind can be carried out with any success .  | SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF FOOD PRICES Economics is largely a study of the various aspects of supply and demand and of money , or its equivalent , as the medium of exchange . Every commodity for which there is a demand and over which man is able to maintain control has come to have its price . Although welfare is the primary purpose of consumption , yet price is the factor which determines to a large extent what we consume . We may know that for our best welfare certain commodities are essential , but if their price is prohibitive we seek to find substitutes or , failing , do without them altogether . This is especially true of food . As has already been shown , man requires a fairly fixed amount of the various and the prices at which they may be purchased cover a wide range . The preceding chapters have shown how wide this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend twice as much as farm and workingmen 's families for about the same amount of nutrients . In other words , they choose foods which in terms of food constituents cost many times as much as those chosen by the laboring group . The purpose of the present chapter is to consider some of the characteristics of food prices influencing consumption . The most outstanding of these is variability . This is caused chiefly by economic  | factors , such as fluctuations in supply and demand or changes in the value of money , and will be here considered in relation to its causes . These are seasonal variability , secular movements , fluctuations due to business cycles , and regional differences . The first and last are tied up closely with supply and demand of food . Secular movements are caused almost directly by changes in the value of money . All of them have their effect on the choice and utilization of food . Not much study has been made of the interrelationships that play between them , but theories there are in abundance . Many graphs have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and demand interplay on price ; how the prices of commodities for which demand is inelastic respond more directly to changes in supply than do those for which demand is elastic ; and how monopolistic conditions give rise to prices which are determined largely by manipulation of the supply . The subject yields itself to abstract discussion of the interplay of economic factors . Concretely little is known . Before this is possible it is necessary to secure specific information concerning many economic attributes . For example , prices of identical commodities must be collected over a long period of time , and their utilization in consumption year after year must be known . Then interpretation of such data in the light of seasonal , cyclical , and secular movements would go far in showing the effect of price changes on consumption . In the present chapter only concrete data bearing on variability in food prices are given together with some discussion of the economic factors that are involved . Food prices are of three types . They include those for farm products paid directly to the farmer , whole- sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and retail prices paid directly by the consumer . These represent three distinct levels of exchange , and though they share many characteristics which are readily shown by the use of index numbers , a study of each type of exchange is best made on the price level that prevails in the transaction . That is , retail prices form the best basis on which to study consumption . The maintenance of a comparable price series over a long period of time is the first essential in a study of price characteristics . Such a series of retail food prices is becoming available . The U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has published yearly food index numbers of retail prices since 1890 , but figures showing monthly price variations date back only to 1911 . Wholesale prices of food , on the other hand , are available in considerable detail for 100 years or more . One of the chief difficulties encountered in the collection of uniform retail prices is caused by the fact that commodities as sold to the consumer vary both in quality and in form to such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long period of time . The great variety in types of retail stores presents another difficulty . Stores that give minimum service ask lower prices than those giving maximum service . It is therefore necessary to weight the various prices in the final average according to the importance of each , and it is not always easy to assign suitable weights . Commodities sold at wholesale , on the other hand , are fairly well standardized , and comparable prices year after year are readily obtainable . Regular quotations and the concentration of  | industry in relatively few hands tend to keep the latter more nearly uniform over the country . The present study is based largely on retail prices , but certain analyses involving wholesale prices have been made which support some of the findings in the characteristics of the former . They are introduced here for comparison and corroboration . Price Levels. ? For a study of changes in price level , index numbers become the most convenient . They are fully discussed in Chap . XVII . As has already been explained an index is a relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years being taken as the base , and usually called 100 , and those for other years expressed in percentage of the base price . The U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics uses the year 1913 as the base for its retail price index . It also used the same year for the index of wholesale prices until 1927 when it changed the base to 1926 . In Chap . VI an index number for all commodities for the years 1801 ? 1928 is shown graphically ( Fig. 5 ) and is valuable in picturing a long-time price trend in the United States . It is based on wholesale prices . Although it is made up of three different series which are not strictly comparable , the index probably reflects with a fair degree of accuracy general wholesale price changes over this period . Approximately 150 commodities were used in making up the numbers for the earlier years and 250 for the later years . Such an index is valuable in showing changes in real income , or in purchasing power . If an individual had a fixed money income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would vary enormously . In some years he might find himself on the verge of starvation ; in others he would live like a king .  | Although one naturally thinks that the price level is very much higher now than it was 100 years ago the chart shows that such is not the case . The index , however , is for all commodities . A food index for the same period based on either wholesale or retail prices would undoubtedly read quite differently . Such an index instead of showing a fairly constant trend marked by cyclical fluctuations of varying inter sity would in all probability show a tendency toward increasing prices . In fact the study made by Woodhouse in which retail figures are quoted indicates that this would be true . The general price level is the same in the two periods , being about 50 per cent above the 1913 level . With prices of individual foodstuffs , however , Woodhouse found considerable variation . The price of butter was about 30 per cent higher in 1926 ? 1927 than it was in 1816 ? 1817 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 75 per cent higher , and turkey almost four times as much . There is further evidence that prices for pork were similar in the two periods and that sugar and raisins were much more expensive in 1816 ? 1817 than at the present time . Although the evidence is incomplete there is no reason to doubt that the bulk of the foods forming the basis of the American diet were obtained at lower prices 110 years ago than they are today . Since the total amount spent by the two families was practically the same and since the food prices relative to the general price level were somewhat lower in the earlier period it follows that the buying power was greater in 1816 . This is offset , however , by the services received in return for the money expended in 1926 ? 1927 . They include prepared breakfast foods , canned foods , meals out , and greatly improved methods of storage .  | Seasonal Variation in Food Prices. ? Index numbers of retail prices indicate that , on the whole , food prices decline in the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These fluctuations are due largely to differences in supply and to the perishability of most foodstuffs . The variation that occurs between the high and the low prices of a given food during the year is about 8 to 10 per cent . To determine the effect of seasonal variation on the retail prices of foods two series showing the average variation in 11 foodstuffs over a period of years were calculated by the writer from retail prices published by the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics . One covers the 16 years 1913 ? 1928 , and the other covers the years since deflation , 1922 ? 1928 . They were obtained by totaling the monthly prices given during these periods and then expressing the sum of each as percentage deviations from the sum of the January prices . In general for the 11 basic foodstuffs the two series showed such similar results that only those for the years 1913 ? 1928 are presented in Fig. 6 . Foods that fluctuate widely are beef , pork , eggs , butter , and potatoes . The prices of lard , cheese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other hand , fairly stable . The World War with its speculation in food is reflected by the price changes of flour , bread , potatoes , and sugar . These differences are indicated in Fig. 6 by dotted lines for the 1922 ? 1928 period . Here it is shown that bread is practically free from seasonal variations , while those of flour and sugar are very small . Potatoes , on the other hand , show almost as wide fluctuations as they do when the war period is included . The deviations from the January price are about equally divided . In other words , the  | January price of potatoes is near the average for the year . The 11 foods show large differences in their price reactions to the seasons . Meats are high in the summer , beef prices reaching their high point in July and pork in September . Flour and potatoes show a similar tendency . Eggs , butter , milk , and cheese are relatively low in the spring and summer and high in the fall and winter . Sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fall . The influences responsible for such fluctuations in price are many , but in the long run the supply available for consumption is the chief factor . Demand for the basic foods remains rather constant ? so much so , in fact , that a record of the food consumed by a family over one or two weeks is a good criterion of its food habits , whereas due to seasonal production the supply is variable . To offset this the development of storage facilities and methods of preservation has revolutionized the food industry in recent years . It has brought about an equalization in the supply of many perishable goods over the year which results in a tendency toward the stabilization of price . This is shown best by flour and sugar prices which are kept fairly constant . Meat products are intermediate . Although much has been done to improve storage facilities for meat it is not yet possible to eliminate all seasonal influences . Moreover , the figures for beef and pork reflect farm habits . The tendency on the farm is to pasture stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . This would result in an excessive supply which it is more profitable to sell immediately than to store . The farmer 's demand for meat is probably another factor influencing these  | prices . During the fall and winter farmers of the country usually kill and preserve meat for their family 's consumption so that their demand for meat from the markets is practically nil . In the summer , however , the farmer is unable to rely on this source because of lack of the necessary storage facilities . During this time therefore he buys his meat . With 25 per cent of the population entering the field of demand , prices are sure to be affected . Greater seasonal variation is shown by the foods which lend themselves least readily to storage or to other forms of preservation . This is especially true of eggs , butter , and potatoes . Since the consumer prefers these products fresh , the supply as it comes from the farm determines pretty largely what the price will be . Figure 6 accordingly indicates that the supply of eggs is greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter in May , June , and July . Potatoes show a decided increase in price in June and a decided drop immediately after . This marks the time when new potatoes begin to be plentiful . Mills in a study of the behavior of prices measured the monthly variation in the wholesale prices of these 11 foods during the 35 years 1890-1925 . He expressed his results in percentages , obtaining them by dividing the mean deviation from the average price for the year by the average yearly price . His figures measure not only seasonal changes but reflect secular and cyclical movements as well . The figures for variability found by Mills are shown in Table XIV and are valuable for comparison with Fig. 6 . They are based on calendar years . For the foods that have a marked crop year such as wheat or potatoes the measure of variability would be lower if quoted for the crop year  | instead of the calendar year . Potatoes , for instance , have a variability of 14.4 for crop years and 26.3 for calendar years . This difference is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be reflected in the corresponding price levels . The figures shown in Table XIV for wholesale prices tell , on the whole , a story similar to that indicated by the graphs in Fig. 6 , based on retail prices of foods . Although the study of seasonal variation made by Mills includes a longer period than that included by the writer , and although wholesale prices are always more variable than retail , the relative values for the 11 foods by the two methods are very similar . Bread prices are most stable , and those for eggs and potatoes are least stable . Flour , sugar , lard , beef , and pork are intermediate in their monthly variability . Pork prices are more variable than those of beef . The two foods which are not in line with the monthly variation based on retail prices are milk and cheese . Retail prices show them as foods with low monthly variation whereas measures of variability calculated from wholesale prices indicate that monthly changes are relatively high . Monthly variability during the World War period followed its usual course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graphs that have been given reflect largely the effects of seasonal variation . Nevertheless the influence of cyclical movements and secular trend is also present . From month to month these economic forces usually move slowly , and their changes are accordingly difficult to detect . For such a study prices over a long period of time are needed . The index of all commodities for the years 1801 ? 1928 shown in Fig. 5 ( Chap . VI ) reveal these influences best .  | During the 127 years covered , there are three distinct peaks , after which prices fall rather steadily until some force starts them moving upward again . The forces producing such fluctuations are called business cycles and secular trend . Economists explain secular trend in prices as due to the relationship that exists between the quantity of goods available for consumption and that of money with which to purchase them . During the years 1865 ? 1896 gold production was on the decline while goods for consumption were increasing rapidly . The price level was as a result declining . In 1896 important gold deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued at a fairly regular rate until 1915 when due to the war they shot up with almost incredible speed . Figure 7 , an all-commodity index for the years 1860-1925 , indicates secular trend since 1896 by a line of dashes . If the world had gone forward after 1915 without a war and if the effect of the gold supply remained constant , prices in 1925 would have been about 25 per cent lower than they were . The violent fluctuations from year to year shown in Figs. 5 and 7 point to economic influences other than secular trend . These are cyclical movements caused primarily by business conditions . They influence markedly employment conditions , crops , wages , profits , interest rates , and stock market values . Figure 5 shows three very high peaks ? one in 1814 when prices were 124 per cent above the 1913 price  | level ; again in 1865 when they were 90 per cent above ; and a third in 1920 when they were 126 per cent above . The peaks in all cases reflect war conditions periods when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual employment is transferred to the production of goods essential to war and to military activities , while demand for consumption goods remains the same . Moreover , in order to meet the unusual demands put upon the government large issues of paper money are made and currency becomes very much inflated . All of these factors unite to bring about increased prices . The drop which follows is due to a reversal of these forces . Year-to-year fluctuations in prices may be due to any or all of these influences . Figures 5 and 7 show the situation for all commodities and are based on wholesale prices . Figures 8 and 9 reflect the influences of cyclical and secular movements on the retail prices of foods during the years 1913 ? 1928 inclusive . Actual retail prices for foods from animal sources are shown in Fig. 8 , and those for vegetable foods in Fig. 9 . In all cases except eggs and milk the average price per pound during the year is used . Eggs are priced by the dozen and milk by the quart . They are derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Statistics . The first thing that strikes one on looking at the two charts is that the price range is much greater for animal foods . It is 9 to 70 cents , whereas the price of the vegetable foods is covered during the 15 years by a range of 1.5 to 20 cents . All of the foods show the influence of the war period . Prices of all except milk began to climb in 1915 and reached a peak in 1919 or 1920 after which there was a rapid drop followed by a more or less irregular plateau . The price  | of milk did not respond to war influences until 1916 . Even during the stormy period that followed , its yearto-year changes were orderly . In 1920 beef prices had increased only 77 per cent while potato prices were 271 per cent above their 1913 price level . The increase in the prices of other foods ranged between these two limits in the following order : butter , 83 per cent ; milk , 88 per cent ; eggs , 97 per cent ; fresh pork , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flour , 146 per cent ; and sugar , 253 per cent . Lard reached its high point in 1919 , when it was 134 per cent above its 1913 level . During 1920 the price dropped considerably . Fresh pork also reached its peak in 1919 , but during 1920 the price remained constant . Since the deflation in 1921 considerable variation has occurred in the prices of these foods . Milk , bread , and beef prices have been fairly steady in their year-to-year fluctuations . Potatoes and sugar , on the other hand , show wide fluctuations . The retail price index for foods indicates that prices since 1921 have averaged about 50 per cent above the 1913 level . The prices of the 10 foods shown in Figs. 8 and 9 show wide variations from this average . Lard , eggs , butter , and sugar have , on the average , maintained prices below , whereas milk , beef , pork , bread , flour , and potatoes have maintained an average price above the general price level for foods . Mills has calculated the year-to-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are the percentage difference between the price of a commodity in each year and that of the preceding year , the latter being used each time as the base period . The measure of variability given in Table XV is the mean  | deviation from the mean of link relatives of average annual prices . By this method the effect of secular trend is in part eliminated . This may be illustrated by a period when prices are increasing at a constant rate of 2 per cent a year . In a series of that kind each of the annual link relatives would have a value of 102 , and the mean deviation would be zero . These measures therefore indicate the price departure from a constant rate of decrease or increase . In this study Mills compares the variability in retail prices of 11 foods during two periods , 1890 ? 1913 and 1890 ? 1924 . Among them he found milk the least variable in its year-to-year fluctuations and potatoes most variable . The various foods , on the whole , followed the same order in the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prewar period 1890 ? 1913 they were : milk , round steak , butter , eggs , ham , pork chops , sugar , bacon , flour , lard , potatoes . When the war period and the readjustment years that followed are included sugar is more variable than all of the foods except potatoes , reflecting again the speculation in food that occurred during these years . Prices of all the foods , in fact , are considerably more variable when the war and postwar periods are included than in the prewar period . Altogether the relative variability found by Mills for 34 years resembles that shown by the writer for the 15 years . Although wholesale prices , on the whole , do not conform in any systematic manner to the cyclical movement of general prices , most of them are affected by these fluctuations . During 10 cycles observed during the years 1890 ? 1925 Mills found that 4 of the 10 foods featured in this section showed a response to  | all of the cycles , namely , beef , milk , butter , and potatoes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cyclical movements ; flour , eggs , and lard , by 8 ; and bread in New York by 4 ? and in Cincinnati by 21 . Price changes for lard , pork , eggs , butter , and flour usually precede , whereas those of bread , sugar , potatoes , milk , and beef lag behind the major turns in the general index of wholesale prices . The price characteristics described here are calculated from average retail and wholesale prices . The former were derived from 39 to 51 cities in the United States , and the latter from a few of the leading markets of the country . The charts and figures presented show that the price of a single foodstuff over a period of time responds to many influences , the most outstanding of which are seasonal variation , secular trend , cyclical movements , and periods of inflation and deflation .  | There are important differences among the various foodstuffs , however , in their response to these influences . As a rule those which show a wide monthly variation also have wide fluctuations from year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of correlation of 0.70 between the measures of monthly and year-to-year variability calculated by him . Perfect correlation between two factors is indicated by 1.0 . A correlation as high as 0.7 points to a significant interrelationship . His figure is based on wholesale prices and includes many commodities other than food . A similar correlation , however , would no doubt be found between the measures of monthly and year-to-year fluctuations in the retail price of food . Regional Differences in Food Prices. ? Besides differences in the prices of food over periods of time there are also variations due to location . Mills measured the regional differences in retail prices given by the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics during two years , 1913 and 1924 . In 1913 food prices were available for 39 cities ; and in 1924 , for 51 cities . His measure here is similar in principle to that calculated for monthly variation ? namely , the mean deviation expressed as a percentage of the mean value of all cities . His measures for regional differences in the price of 32 foods are given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the whole the degree of variability in prices follows the same general tendency in the two years chosen for study . Furthermore , the prices of foods which can be stored satisfactorily and are readily standardized tend to be less variable than those of highly perishable foodstuffs . Centralized markets  | of distribution may also be a factor in stabilizing prices . Products from the same source show considerable variation . Pork products , for instance , range from 5 per cent for lard to 7 or 8 per cent for bacon . Beef , which is more variable than pork , shows a similar tendency . Chuck roast has a regional variability of 5 to 10 , whereas the variability in the prices of round steak is from 11 to 16 per cent . The variability in wheat cereal is relatively low , while that of flour is intermediate . Differences in regional variability are probably associated with local variations in demand . This is indicated by lard , with a relatively low variability in price ; and lard substitute , with a much higher price variation . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevails , a situation that would produce an uncertain market and correspondingly irregular prices . The prices paid by the consumer month after month and year after year fluctuate enormously . Some foods are more variable in price than others . If one 's income automatically varied with the price level these fluctuations would have little effect on the buying power of the consumer . As it is , however , much hardship and suffering result from this instability . Economists have proposed methods of maintaining a constant price level to supplant the economic uncertainty that prevails at present . These are based chiefly on a readjustment in our attitude toward money . Today money is regarded as the index of income value . In reality , however , its buying power in terms of commodities is its true value . This is expressed by economists by the term real income , as  | opposed to money income . It is thought that if some of the key commodities were included with gold to determine value , variability in price levels would disappear . If such a change were accomplished it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of uncertainty and doubts , he would at all times know what his money would buy , and his consumption needs could be more wisely met.  | SPREAD BETWEEN CONSUMER 'S AND PRODUCER 'S PRICES The preceding chapter has shown that food prices when compared on the same basis display great variation . When comparison is made of the various prices paid for an identical commodity along the line of distribution the variation is extreme . In the food industry there are three main levels of exchange , each one of which claims its share of the consumer 's dollar . The prices that prevail at each level vary widely . These are commonly called producer , or farm , wholesale , and retail prices . The spread between them is usually large and is caused by a great number of factors . Comparisons like the ones included here should be based on the prices for identical commodities . For many foodstuffs , however , it is impossible to follow an identical commodity from producer to consumer because of the modifications to which it is necessarily subjected in the marketing process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farm as whole grain , goes to the miller who turns it into flour , discarding about 30 per cent of the whole grain for cattle feed ; the flour then goes to the baker who mixes it with other commodities and sends it on to the ultimate consumer in the form of bread . Many other foods go through similarly elaborate preparations for consumption , and as the number of steps increases the spread in price between producer and consumer grows .  | Little investigation has been made of this spread . The Federal Trade Commission in some of its recent investigations into unfair commercial practices has given it consideration , and a few organizations have made some study of the factors that are involved . On the whole the data presented in this chapter are gathered from scattered sources and point rather to general trends in the food situation as it exists today than to an evaluation of the services rendered . The analysis of the spread between producer and consumer in the light of real and necessary service to each is left to future studies . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rumors are heard every once in awhile of some feat in chemistry which will ultimately revolutionize the food industry resulting in the synthesis of all of our foods . Immense factories will then replace the great open spaces that are now dotted with farms , and the food supply will be entirely in man 's hands . No longer shall we have cause to worry in times of drought or flood . The elements will be stored and at hand ready to build into whatever foods or nutrients we want . Such a Utopia may attract scientific interest , but its realization will probably be delayed beyond our day . Meanwhile the price received by the farmer for his produce in terms of what the consumer pays remains of vital importance . It is impossible to state with accuracy how great this spread is on the average . Weld in 1915 made a careful study of farm produce in Minnesota , however , and on the basis of his findings estimated that when the value of each commodity marketed is taken into consideration the Minnesota farmer receives about 60 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Minnesota produce includes not only food entering into human consumption but also feed for animals . Since the latter is used mostly in the form in which it leaves the farm the producer probably receives for it a larger proportion of the consumer 's price than he does of that paid for human foods which undergo extensive preparation in the course of distribution . The figure 60 per cent , therefore , is somewhat higher than the proportion of the consumer 's dollar received by him for foods designed for human consumption . How much this exceeds his share it is impossible to say . Since the spread between the cost of a diet priced at wholesale and at retail gives a clue to the differences Table XVII is included . This is taken from a thesis on food index numbers filed in the library at Stanford University . It shows the value of 11 basic foods when priced according to wholesale and retail prices . The weights used in the two series are the same and are based on the importance of each food in consumption . The foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beef , pork , milk , cheese , butter , lard , eggs , bread , flour , sugar , and potatoes . Figure 10 , which presents the same data graphically , shows monthly variations from the two series . The figures used in the construction of the chart were corrected for seasonal variation so that this factor is not reflected in the fluctuations . Those which appear from month to month in the index representing spread are caused by the fact that the two types of prices do not react simultaneously and to the same degree to secular and cyclical movements . In calculating the spread between wholesale and retail prices the sum of the food budget priced at  | food were about 65 per cent above wholesale ; from 1917 through 1919 , or during the period of inflation produced by the war , the spread decreased , retail prices remaining a little over 50 per cent above wholesale ; and since 1921 they have remained rather steadily at more than 70 per cent above wholesale . The years 1916 and 1920 were periods of adjustment to new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The period covered by this study is short and may not justify a generalization . But it looks as if the wholesale dealer after the World War was getting a somewhat larger proportion of the consumer 's dollar spent for food than he was before the war . Whether this reflects changes in our marketing system or is simply a chance variation it is not yet possible to say . Studies over a much longer period of time are needed . If the spread shown in Fig. 10 between wholesale and retail prices of food is correct , Weld 's estimate of 60 per cent of the price paid by the consumer as the farmer 's share in Minnesota does not hold for the foods that enter into human consumption . With a spread of 50 to 70 per cent between wholesale and retail prices the farmer 's share of the consumer 's dollar spent for food would not equal so much as 30 to 50 per cent . Hedden in a study of the spread between the price paid to the farmer and that paid by the consumer has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables and fruits . This is reproduced in Fig. 11 and indicates not only the cost of distribution but also volume of sales . He found that the cost of distribution of these foods requires from 38 to 65 per cent of the price paid by the consumer . White onions take the  | largest proportion and new potatoes the least . Ranging between the two are sweet potatoes , cabbage , lettuce , apples , cantaloupes , peaches , and oranges . On the whole , the cost of distribution increases with increasing perishability . That is , the producer receives a lower proportion of the retail price of highly perishable foods than he does of that of the more stable ones . His share therefore would appear to be from 35 to 62 per cent on foods which are used by the consumer in the same form in which they leave the farm . Those which undergo change must necessarily show a wider spread . To show roughly how great this spread may begross prices received by producers and wholesalers are compared here with retail prices . The comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it has some value in showing differences between   foods . The prices were obtained from government sources , but no attempt has been made to account for the many variables that are included . As already stated , wheat changes its form materially before reaching the consumer . The same thing is true of the hogs and steers that leave the farm . Moreover , in the case of the latter different parts of the carcass bring widely differing prices , all of which makes an analysis difficult . Sugar and lard are highly refined products bearing no resemblance to the foods from which they are derived . This analysis therefore should be considered as only rough approximations of the true spread between the various types of prices . The price level in the two years included for consideration varied considerably . In 1919 it was high , while 1926 is representative of the deflation period . In the 1927 " Yearbook of Agriculture " farm prices are available for butter , eggs , wheat , potatoes , hogs , and steers . Since butter , eggs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which each leaves the producer , the comparison is quite direct . Of the three , butter returns to the producer the largest proportion of the consumer 's dollar , and potatoes the least . Comparison of the prices paid by the consumer for beef , pork , and flour with that received by the producer for steers , hogs , and wheat indicates that he usually receives about one-third to one-fourth of the retail price . This is considerably less than the proportion received for butter , eggs , and potatoes and is caused by the additional processes through which the products must go before they are ready for consumption . Moreover , only about 50 per cent of the steer , 75 per cent of the hog , and 70 to 75 per cent of the   wheat enter into the human diet . The balance is not economic waste , for it is made up into by-products of various kinds . But , on the whole , it does represent inedible foods . In practically every case the producer received a larger proportion of the consumer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1926 after their deflation . This is in line with the results in Fig. 10 which shows the largest spread between wholesale and retail prices during the years 1921-1923 . One factor responsible for the relatively low distribution spread during the World War is the government 's control over some of the food prices . Wheat , sugar , beef , and pork prices were under the government 's special protection . The control which continued for several months after the close of the war in November , 1918 , is no doubt reflected in the increased proportion of the consumer 's dollar received by the producer during this time . Comparison of wholesale and retail prices of foods for the same periods , 1919 and 1926 , point to some differences . For pork , milk , butter , sugar , and potatoes they are slight . For beef and flour , on the other hand , the wholesaler 's share was markedly lower after the deflation in prices , and for bread the proportion going to the wholesaler is greater after that time . In 1926 the wholesale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the amount spent by the consumer . Sugar and bread undergo considerable changes after the raw products leave the farm . The manufacturer and wholesaler received 80 per cent of the money spent by the consumer for these products . For the other foods they received about 65 per cent . This is in line with the spread between wholesale and retail prices   of 11 foods shown in Fig. 10 and gives in addition some idea of the variations that occur among the foods . Distribution of the Consumer 's Dollar. ? On the whole the farmer probably receives about 40 to 50 per cent of the money spent by the consumer for food . Where does the remaining 50 to 60 per cent go ? A few studies have been made which show this distribution . Such figures are available for bread , butter , sugar , and chickens . In an analysis of the retail price of bread in Chicago Swarthout shows that the wheat grower received 16 per cent of the price paid by the consumer . Storage and transportation of wheat to the mill took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are based on that part of the wheat used in patent flour . The 30 per cent of the wheat which goes into feed is not included . The miller 's margin and transportation costs from mill to bakery amount to 8 per cent of the final cost . The baker takes 62 per cent and the retailer 12 per cent . The largest slice is therefore taken by the baker . Although the distribution in different cities varies somewhat , the situation in Chicago is typical . Similar figures which are available for butter are given in Table XVIII . They show the distribution of the consumer 's dollar in June and December , 1911 . The situation in regard to butter is quite different from that of bread . Whereas in the case of bread the baker receives the largest proportion of the retail price , in the case of butter the farmer gets the bulk of the final selling price . For the two products the retailer gets about the same proportion ? 11 to 16 per cent . The proportion received by the creamery is slightly higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products is similar .   The months chosen for the study of butter represent periods of high and low prices . In the year 1911 the price of butter in December was 45 per cent above that in June . The producer received a larger proportion of the final selling prices when they were high . This probably reflects the usual situation . The margins received by creamery , wholesaler , and retailer tend to remain fairly constant . With sugar prices the distribution of the retail price among the various agencies refining and handling the product is similar to that of butter . About 70 per cent of the final selling price goes for raw sugar . This would include the price received by the farmer as well as the first manufacturing costs . Then 16 per cent goes for the process of refining , and 13 per cent to the retailer . In marketing chickens the Minnesota farmer receives , on the average , 46 per cent of the price paid by the Minneapolis consumer . The wholesaler 's gross margin is 10 per cent , and the retailer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion than it does with bread and butter , being 7 per cent . The rest , 17 per cent , goes for killing , losses in shrinkage , packing , storage , and so forth . These are , of course , only a few of the foods in the American diet , but they give a very good idea of the differences that occur in their distribution . Bread , for instance , a highly finished product yields to the producer of the wheat only 16 per cent of the money spent by the consumer , while butter , which goes to the consumer in much the same form as it leaves the farm , yields the producer 70 per cent . This would probably cover the range found in an extensive study of the cost of distribution of all the foodstuffs .   Factors Causing Differences in Spread. ? From 16 to 70 per cent of the money spent by the consumer for the various foods goes , as a rule , to the producer . The average is about 40 to 50 per cent . These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the chief of them is the number of steps through which a commodity must go before it reaches the consumer . Eggs go through a process of standardization before they are ready for the market . Butter is still made on the farms in large quantities . What does not leave in that form goes to the creameries as cream . Most of the milk consumed in our cities goes through a process of pasteurization before it is delivered . These are relatively simple steps . Bread and meats of all kinds furnish us with examples of more elaborate preparation during distribution , and the spread in prices between producer and consumer is correspondingly wider . The proportion of the consumer 's dollar going to the producer of fruits and vegetables amounts to 38 to 65 per cent , according to Hedden . This would seem to be a wide spread for foods that leave the farm   ready for consumption . The chief factor in this case is perishability . Foods that are stored with difficulty tend to glut the market , resulting in a large amount of waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For foods of this kind one would expect to find times of the year when retail prices for them were low . This , of course , occurs within limits , but instead of reducing the retail prices on these foods to a point where demand will increase , food industries allow them to rot in the fields and orchards . Scarcely a year goes by that rumors of great wastes in fruits or vegetables are not heard . Farmers within a radius of 100 miles of New York City , for instance , are not able to find a market for their apples , and yet the consumer goes on paying 5 cents apiece for an apple suitable for eating raw or 6 to 7 cents a pound for cooking apples . In the study of distribution costs made by Hedden he found that volume of sales is an important factor . The cost of distribution per unit decreases , on the whole , as the volume of sales , expressed in money value , increases . Among the foods studied by him white onions cost the most to distribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of potatoes amounted to seventy times that of white onions . The cost of distribution per unit for the various foods increased in the following order : new potatoes , California oranges , old potatoes , peaches , boxed apples , cantaloupes , Eastern lettuce , yellow onions , barreled apples , Southern cabbage , Western lettuce , Northern cabbage , sweet potatoes , white onions . The subdivisions to which the work of distribution is allotted are indicated by examples given in this chapter . The demands of each on the consumer 's dollar differs with the types of foodstuff , but each   takes its dole . Criticisms of this part of our economic system are often heard , the statement being frequently made that there are too many middlemen . A country shipper sends produce to the commission merchant or wholesaler in the city who in turn sells to the jobber who supplies the retail grocer who sells to the ultimate consumer . Our distribution system sounds like the house that Jack built . If the produce sold from the farm needs no special preparation for consumption it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it reaches the consumer . If it needs modification , such as is given to bread or sugar , the number becomes legion . In recent years the tendency in the manufacturing and wholesaling processes involved in the distribution of food is toward integration , whereas in the case of retailing small stores still spring up on every corner . What effect such movements as these have on the consumer 's price we are not yet able to say . The studies that have been made of the costs of distribution are largely from the point of view of the distributor . If the consumer learns anything from them which may help him meet his problems more wisely he must make his own deductions . The problem is big involving many factors difficult to evaluate . The present chapter only scratches the surface , giving some idea , it is hoped , of the importance of this phase of the food problem to the consumer . Careful studies of its forces are needed , and to the student interested in consumption problems it offers a fertile field for investigation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foods are in line with our general industrial trends , that is , concentration of capital and wealth and specialization in labor . The general movement as it occurs in food manufacture is described in Chap . XI . Here the retailing of food is discussed . Where the movements of the day are leading and what will be their final effect on consumption no one is able to say . It is nevertheless incumbent on the consumer to become familiar with them and to evaluate them not only according to present results but with possible future developments in mind as well . To this end , the present chapter not only deals with retail grocery stores but also includes a discussion of the growth of the cooperative movement and a study of the consumer 's responsibility for his market . The growth of our present retail system is of comparatively recent date . One hundred years ago urban communities were in much closer touch with the sources of food supply than they are today , and many commodities were exchanged directly between producer . and consumer . " Marketing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It might be done once a week ; often it occurred less frequently . Many farmers marketed only once annually , bringing in their produce in the fall and taking back supplies sufficient to last them until the following autumn . Such  | marketing methods meant that supplies were purchased in large quantities , and the home forced to meet the storage problem . Even town houses had their cellars and large storage pantries , but as cities became more congested smaller housing quarters for the family resulted , and increased difficulties were encountered in caring for large quantities of food . Meanwhile , storage facilities on an industrial scale grew rapidly and became so efficient that it seemed better and possibly cheaper to let the distributor rather than the consumer of food take the chances of deterioration . Increasingly smaller stores of supplies were kept in the home and the necessity to market more and more frequently resulted , until at present most housewives market daily . In some homes it is necessary to send out for supplies before each meal . Such a change has naturally brought about changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks , to do one 's marketing one now expects to find a small grocery store on the nearest corner . And to meet this demand the movement has necessarily been away from concentrated retail markets toward small units scattered throughout urban communities . Moreover , such changes in consumer 's demand have resulted in similar changes in the demands of the retailer upon the wholesaler . Not only are his purchases smaller , as a whole , but also commodities in smaller units are desired . For example , retail trade may demand butter in %- instead of 1-pound packages or flour in 7- instead of 24-pound sacks . Package goods are increasingly popular and all such changes mean increased labor on the part of the wholesaler . Furthermore , since much of the retail business is done   on credit , demands upon the wholesaler for credit are greatly increased and the chances of loss become greater as the number of retailers grows . In other words , the trend in the household today and in consequence the demands of the retailer upon the wholesaler are for ever increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and service in the way of credit . All of these must be paid for by the consumer , and the spread between producer 's and consumer 's prices must necessarily grow . Figure 10 ( Chap . IX ) points to a spread more than 5 per cent greater today than it was before the World War . Some of the increase is no doubt due to this demand for service . The retail grocer is the man who , in the rounds of exchange , makes personal contacts with the consumer . Because he is a tangible and definite entity and because the consumer knows so little about the steps through which the commodity has gone to reach the retailer , he becomes the target for most of the public resentment felt by the consumer in a period of high prices . If there are accusations of profiteering they are usually leveled against him . Nevertheless before placing all the blame for the high cost of food on the retail grocer it would be well for the consumer to become a bit introspective . The retailer caters directly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a successful business he reflects pretty accurately the consumer 's desires . Only 1.8 per cent of the margin claimed by the retailer is net profit , whereas 17.3 per cent goes to meet the actual expense of making the final transfer of goods to the consumer . That is , for every dollar spent by the consumer for food , a little over 17 cents is required to pay for making the exchange . The cost of doing business is certainly   high , and it is quite natural to ask whether this is in response to the consumer 's demand or whether it simply indicates inefficiency on the part of this business . The operating expenses include salaries , wages , advertising , wrapping and delivery of goods , rent , heat , light , taxes , licenses , insurance , repairs , depreciation of store equipment , and interest . A careful consideration of the various items , their necessity , and their relation to the volume of sales is needed before one can fix the responsibility for their existence on the demands of consumption or of distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food in the United States is handled through stores under two types of management , independent and chain . The independent is usually under the direct management of the owner . He is one of the clerks in the store and therefore knows his patrons . He is then in a position to know their demands and to take immediate steps to meet them . Furthermore , he is usually able to extend credit to those whom he can trust for future payment . Altogether a direct contact is set up between owner and regular patron which both find satisfactory . A chain store , on the other hand , is owned by some company which may have its offices in a distant city . A manager is put in charge of the branch store with practically no power to determine its policy . He is oftentimes a stranger and does not stay long enough in a community to become acquainted with his patrons . A standard line of goods is carried , and if a customer comes in asking for some commodity he does not have he has no authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thus restricted by rules over which he has no control . Nevertheless the growth   of chain grocery stores has been phenomenal in recent years . The Federal Reserve Board reported a gain of 75 per cent in the 3 years 1923-1926 . Some of the companies have branches extending throughout the country , others are more local in character . The system lends itself to many economies . The business is large enough so that market conditions can be constantly studied , business trends being noted and purchases being made in accordance with them . The goods that are not profitable can be discontinued and nationally advertised products for which there is the most demand introduced in their place . A central purchasing department can oftentimes buy in sufficiently large quantities direct from the producer so that the profits of one or two middlemen are saved . Centralized bakeries are maintained by some companies . Since chain stores sell for cash they are able to meet their obligations promptly , thus saving high interest that commonly goes with credit . How great are the profits accomplished by this method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores have steadily increased their dividends and at the same time have invested considerable capital in expansion . The method of pricing goods generally used by these stores has been to undersell the independents enough to attract trade . In some cases leaders are featured . Sugar , for instance , may be advertised at greatly reduced prices . When this method is used it is customary for the store to make up its loss by prices asked for other goods . In many communities much resentment has been felt toward the growth of chain stores . Local chambers of commerce have opposed them because they take trade away from men living in the community  | who have a live interest in its welfare and development . Congress has also devoted considerable discussion to this movement . Most of the sentiment there is against combination in trade in favor of free competition . In Chap . IX it was shown that the retailer of food usually receives a large proportion of the final selling price as his portion for doing business For the four commodities for which details are given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gross margin . The Bureau of Business Research at Harvard University in a study of the operating expenses in retail grocery stores found similar figures . It reports that in the typical retail store in 1923 the expense of doing business claimed , on the average , 19 per cent of the consumer 's dollar . This is probably a fair average figure for the costs of the retail trade . Among the various types of stores , however , there are substantial deviations from this average due to the savings that may be accomplished by the elimination of service . Grocery stores are of four main types , when classified according to the services rendered , namely , credit and delivery , cash and delivery , cash and carry , and selfservice . A big saving is possible when a retail grocer puts his business on a strictly cash basis . It enables him to buy for cash , and he runs no risks from bad debts . If in addition to cash terms he also eliminates delivery service he makes a further saving . How great these may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit and delivery stores with those designated as cash and carry . In a study made by the Port of New York Authority in 1922-1923 , it was found that there was an average difference of 14 per cent in the prices received by the  | two types of stores . The consumer paid 27 cents at the credit-and-delivery store for the average purchase and 23 cents at the cash-and-carry store for the same quantity of goods . Factors other than service are no doubt included in this difference . Since credit-and-delivery stores cater , as a rule , to the people who are able to pay for the service , they are commonly located in neighborhoods where rents are high , and they maintain a greater variety of stock than do the cash-and-carry stores a situation which results in slower turnover and a correspondingly higher cost per unit for doing business . This is illustrated in a study of 128 grocery stores made by the New York Department of Farms and Markets in which the stores were classified according to the economic status of their patrons . It was found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on investment was 9.2 in the stores catering to the poor as against 6.6 in those serving the wealthy . The amount of stock carried by the latter was about three times as great as that of the former . The actual cost of doing business with the wealthy was correspondingly greater , being , on the average , 17 per cent of the selling price , whereas with the poor it amounted to only 12.7 per cent . Moreover , the net return in the stores serving the poor was about 30 per cent greater than that in the stores catering to the wealthy . Since the former were made up largely of cash-and-carry and the latter of credit-and-delivery stores , the differences indicated by these figures reflect to a considerable extent the differences in these two types of stores . In some parts of the country the " serve-yourself " store has become rather common in the retailing of foods . Here the goods are arranged conveniently  | on shelves with prices conspicuously indicated . The customer is free to go about and take her time to select goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she takes the goods to a clerk whose business it is to collect for them and to wrap the packages . Such a business is usually carried on on a cash-and-carry basis . The savings here consist not only in reduced expenses incident with no deliveries or credit but also in wages . The number of employees needed for a $1,000-a-day business is only about half as great in a self-service establishment as in the regular cash-and-carry store . The figures given here point to definite savings that are possible if the housewife is willing to perform for herself certain of the services ordinarily given by the retailer . Patronage of cash-and-carry instead of credit-and-delivery stores should bring her a net return of 10 to 15 per cent , and self-service would no doubt cut her food bill even further . Whether any of the economies derived from combination have been passed on to any extent to the consumer is doubtful . What savings result from the patronage of chain stores are no doubt due to the fact that they ask cash for goods and eliminate other services usually given by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food which is steadily gaining favor in Europe is through cooperatives . Although they are of no special importance in our system today , they may ultimately be recognized as a valuable means of meeting the consumer 's problems . A discussion of such cooperatives as they exist here and in other countries is therefore included . Since Great Britain was the pioneer in the development of consumers ' cooperatives and since  | the growth of such societies has been most rapid in that country , a brief history of the British movement is given . The first successful cooperative appears among the flannel weavers in Rochdale , England , in 1843 . Having failed in a strike for higher wages the weavers found their economic situation such that they must do something to help themselves . Although the wage system of the period was an affront to civilization , the credit system by which the wage earner met his everyday needs was probably worse . Under it he was never free from debt . After much discussion of the possible solutions to their problems a group of weavers finally decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own needs at the lowest possible cost . In order to carry out the project they each saved two pence a week , and at the end of a year the group had accumulated $140 with which to start the enterprise . They rented a small store in Toad Lane , Rochdale , for $50 a year , and after buying the necessary equipment they had only $75 with which to buy supplies . At first they opened the store only two evenings a week and the members took turns in serving the customers . The commodities offered for sale were four , namely , flour , butter , sugar , and oatmeal . For several years it was a question whether this society would go the way of all previous attempts of this kind or whether it might maintain itself until it could prove its value and its possibilities . At the end of the first year it had 80 members and a capital of $905 . The following year it increased its service by adding meat to its stock . In 1847 , four years later , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 1850 it had over 600 members , and its capital was well toward $10,000 . Success was thereby assured and rapidly led to the development of other societies . By 1863 there were enough retail cooperatives to justify the establishment of a wholesale store . In fact , the wholesale store became necessary because of the opposition these societies met from businesses organized for profit . By 1925 there were 1,381 consumer 's cooperative societies supplying about 45 per cent of t population of the country . The cooperative movement in Great Britain includes , besides retail and wlholesale stores , farms , banks , and insurance . It has often been asked why the Rolhdale undertaking succeeded when so many other societies have failed in Great Britain . One reason , of course , was the loyalty and determination of the men who started it ? their holding on through the early years of discouragement and opposition . But above all was their plan of organization . Without some of the principles embodied in it this society would have met the fate of its predecessors , and cooperatives would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six principles : ( 1 ) The capital for the business is subscribed by consumer members ; ( 2 ) each stockholder of the society has but one vote in the business affairs of the company , and he must vote in person ; ( 3 ) the earnings of capital are limited to the prevailing rate of interest on money ; ( 4 ) goods are sold to individual members at prices similar to those asked at other stores ; ( 5 ) after the formation of suitable reserves and the payment of interest on capital invested , the surplus above the cost of doing business is divided among the members  | in proportion to their purchases ; and ( 6 ) goods are sold for cash . The principles which have been found to be of fundamental importance for the success of such societies are two , namely , the allowance of only one vote to a stockholder and the adoption of current prices for the selling price to members of the societies . Practically all societies which have not adhered to these two principles have gone on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of votes assigned to an individual depends on the amount of stock held , the control of the company rapidly falls into the hands of a limited number of individuals , and the policies are then designed largely for the profit of a few instead of for the welfare of the entire group . The society loses all semblance of cooperation . The method of assigning voting power to stockholders of cooperatives departs radically from that which prevails in corporations and industrial concerns of today . The principle of the same selling price to members and non-members , and that the prevailing one , is equally essential . It is very difficult in advance to calculate with exactness the cost of doing business . And since people tend to be optimistic concerning the buying power of money they tend to under- rather than overestimate the cost of carrying out a project . Furthermore , members want to derive as much personal benefit from the undertaking as possible and would therefore , oftentimes unconsciously , influence the decision for their own benefit . The societies which have used the " cost-plus " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method or go out of business .  | Although consumer 's cooperative societies have an important place in the industrial life of many countries the situation prevailing in the United States has not been especially conducive to the growth of such organizations . Since Americans are essentially individualistic an unusually strong motive is required to cause them to work unitedly for a common cause . The hardships resulting from labor and credit conditions in Great Britain which gave the vement such impetus there have never been so g t a problem here . Although times have been h , they have usually passed before a cooperative so ty could prove its worth , and the movement has th efore met with little encouragement . Furthermore , our retail grocery stores have always been run on a fairly efficient and satisfactory basis . Conditions at the close of the World War , however , were such that the idea of cooperation became attractive . Prices in this country had risen considerably more than wages above the prewar level . The consumer , as a group , felt this decreased buying power keenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great number of cooperative societies . In the latter part of 1920 , however , prices fell rapidly and unemployment resulted . Many of the newly started societies met a speedy death . The U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics made a survey of the situation as it existed in that year . Again in 1925 it collected data to see what effect the prosperity that followed the slump in 1920 had had on cooperatives . It found that although the mortality of cooperative stores had been high , yet the years 1920 ? 1925 had been conducive to the growth and development of the stores that survived .  | Retail store societies dealing in groceries increased in membership 50 per cent . The average sales per store increased more than one-third , and the average sales per member increased 22 per cent . The amount returned the members in dividends was almost 4 per cent on their purchases . When calculated on the share capital invested in the societies the return was high . In addition to a fixed rate of interest 29 per cent was paid . All but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at current prices . The average life of the societies included in the survey made by the Bureau of Labor Statistics was a little over 10 years . Among the states Minnesota leads in the number of retail cooperatives , with Wisconsin and Illinois following . The fact that the bulk of the societies are to be found in the north central states in all probability points directly to the unrest that has prevailed in our agricultural regions since the World War . The maladjustment between agriculture and industrial prices during this period , in terms of their relation before the war , has forced the farmer to cooperate in every way . Their marketing cooperatives greatly exceed the retail societies in number and membership . As has been already pointed out , however , the United States is far behind other countries in the development of cooperative movements in retail buying . How great the differences are is best set forth by statistics . In 1925 the United Kingdom was in the lead . The U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that 45 per cent of its population at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The United States stands almost at the  | bottom of the list with 2.5 per cent of its population obtaining its supplies in this way . The movement is largely European . In Denmark , Finland , and Hungary 40 per cent of the population depends largely on cooperatives ; in Iceland , Switzerland , France , and Russia , between 30 and 40 per cent ; in Belgium , Germany , and Sweden , about 20 per cent ; and in Norway , Netherlands , Bulgaria , and Australia , between 5 and 15 per cent . The Problem of the Consumer. ? Confronted with the problem of food buying the consumer must face the possibilities squarely if she would solve it wisely . The data that have been given in this chapter show that she can save about 15 per cent if shewilling to pay cash and then carry her purchases home . Many housewives , just as in the old days , go to market with a market basket on the arm or , as we are more accustomed to seeing , a wicker bag in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a household is also in business there would be some question whether she were wise in taking advantage of this possible saving . There are physical limits beyond which it is foolish to try to go . Moreover , it is sometimes asked if the consumer could not reduce the cost of distribution if she would buy in larger quantities at a time . The law for the unit cost of distribution holds in retailing as well as elsewhere . That is , the retailer finds that , by and large , as the volume of sales increases the cost of doing business per unit decreases . Table XIX is a good illustration of this law . It is arranged according to the decreasing gross profit , based on selling price . Although " gross profit " decreases , by and large , as " total trading " increases , yet the different foods show  | wide variations in their response to these influences . Potatoes , for instance , make up as large a part of total trading as flour does , but the gross profit , or total cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are as important in trade as rice , but the expense of selling is almost three times as great . The differences here are caused largely by the fact that losses are more likely to occur due to the perishability and shrinkage in onions and potatoes . Savings would unquestionably result if housewives as a whole bought their supplies in larger quantities .  | For such commodities as canned foods , flour , sugar , and lard there would be little danger of deterioration if this were done . For vegetables , fruits , and meats , however , suitable storage places would have to be installed in the homes and the amount saved in food would probably go into rent . Under our present system of living there is a question therefore whether such a change in marketing would be desirable . The data in this chapter show further that the trend in retailing at the present time is toward concentration of capital and organization resulting in a large number of small units under central control . This has led , moreover , to considerable speculation concerning the ultimate effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly conceded that the method is intelligent and certainly offers promise of reduced costs in retailing . Although the consumer at the present time is not deriving any pronounced benefits from it , he may feel these benefits when they begin active competition among themselves . They may , on the other hand , follow the general trend in industry and either combine into one big chain store or agree on prices . In either case the effect on the consumer will be much the same . He will then be forced to submit to monopoly conditions or to find some way of helping himself . For the latter solution he has a successful demonstration in the cooperatives of Europe .  | ECONOMIC TRENDS IN FOOD MANUFACTURE The economic aspect of the food problem is naturally very complex . It has been shown that prices respond to the usual economic forces ? seasonal , cyclical , and secular movements resulting in pronounced fluctuations which produce confusion in the housewife 's budget . Besides these accepted economic influences there are others which are regarded as designs against free competition and which lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are described in Chap . X. Those which exist in the manufacture of food are of much more serious import . are discussed here . A look at the industrial history of Amer ' a is of importance in understanding the development of the food industries . Watkins ' gives an excellent description of the evolution of the normal market and its ultimate effect on the consumer . He says : The opening of a new and wider market involves pioneering costs which call for the compact association of producers . But once a new market has been opened by the joint action of the associated producers , its development attracts the ambitions and varied talents of many producers , the prizes for successful coinpetition being high . The third and final phase is reached when the limit of expansion of a given market has been touched , and the amount and character of its consumption have become settled and known . The gains from initiative and ingenuity and fore-  | sight are then no longer sufficient to hold producers upon an independent course , and they fall in together for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This gives a very good picture of our own industrial development . The story of pioneer days in Ameria is largely one of cooperation in meeting and overcoming the rigors of wilderness life so that man could live in peace and prosperity in the new country . About 1800 the introduction of machinery run by steam took place , and the century that followed saw an amazing development of agricultural and manufacturing equipment which has revolutionized civilization . Transportation and communication were at the same time developed to such a point that the barriers of space were practically eliminated . Population was increasing rapidly . Fabulous resources were discovered . New markets were at hand , and production went forward at a dizzying pace . This was a period of keen competition . At the beginning of the present century the situation began to change . Markets were well established , and the period of national expansion was drawing to a close . Gradually instead of competition we find the big industries combining for their mutual benefit . Great monopolies developed which threatened to undermine our economic system . The government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavored to maintain competitive conditions , but industry would have nothing of it . By hook or crook , the movement toward mergers has gone forward , and today business is more and more coming under the control of a relatively small group . All of the important foodstuffs have been drawn into the movement . For successful combinations an industry should meet monopoly conditions . They require that the  | raw materials entering into the product be few , simple , and uniform in supply and quality ; that the manufactured product be simple , uniform , easily standardized , and relatively unaffected by style or fashion ; further , that the product be such as to lend itself readily to mass production and distribution ; and that large capital for initiating and carrying on the business be available . Two methods of combination are possible , namely , horizontal and vertical integration . By the first all of the important concerns in a given industry , say bakeries , are brought under a single management . By the second method , usually undertaken after the first has been accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the distribution . Besides such combinations in industry associations of considerable economic importance have at the same time grown up . Every important industry today has one or more associations in which the various individuals and corporations concerned unite to pool their experiences and to give and obtain mutual aid . These , as well as the combinations , are more or less active in fixing the price of their commodity , thus reducing effective competition . A survey of the present status of some of the important food industries is of value in showing the attitude of industry and of the government toward this consumption problem . Combinations. ? The meat industry , according to 1920 census reports , is the largest industry in the United States when measured by the value of its product . It is an example par excellence of the trend toward combination in the food industries . The methods that have been used to accomplish its ends  | are probably less ethical than those used by many industries . This is no doubt due to the nature of the situation that existed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most industries connected with food production and distribution are scattered and in the control of a countless number of individuals . This was not true of the meat industry when late in the last century an investigation of its methods was started by a committee of the United States Senate , which found that an agreement among the leading packers of that time ? Armour , Swift , Morris , and Hammond had proved strong enough to control the entire industry through the fixing of prices and the division of territory and business . A working agreement of such efficiency was made possible only by the fact that the control of each of the companies was in the hands of one or two men and that these concerns were of such size and importance that when united they were able to drive out or bring under their control the independents or reduce them to purely local business . Since the disclosures of the Senate investigation in 1890 , the meat packing industry has been under constant suspicion of using unfair methods of competition , and repeated attempts have been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collusion and restore business to some semblance of competition , but without avail . The strength of the combination has steadily increased . Acting as independent units , but always in agreement , the four or five big packers of the period have reached out and up until their control , not only over the meat industry but over allied food industries as well , has achieved alarming proportions .  | The power of such a combination to dictate prices to both the producer and the consumer of meat is at once apparent . The business readily lends itself to successful combination . Live stock , such as cattle , hogs , and sheep , require considerable labor and equipment to prepare them for human consumption , and a business concern between the producer and consumer is essential . Furthermore , meat is an exceptionally perishable foodstuff unless elaborate refrigeration facilities are available for its storage and transportation . The expensive equipment and specialization of labor necessary for the preparation of meat for consumption lends itself especially well to large-scale activities . As a result the meat industry is now concentrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packing and storing is carried on and from which meat is distributed to all parts of the United States and the world . In 1918 when the Federal Trade Commission made a careful investigation of the meat-packing industry it found that about 70 per cent of the live stock slaughtered by all of the packers and butchers engaged in interstate business was killed by five big packers . They were Armour and Company , Swift and Company , Morris and Company , Wilson and Company , and the Cudahy Packing Company . These five corporations together with about 500 affiliated companies , bound together by joint ownership , agreements , and understandings and by family relationships , controlled the entire interstate trade . They had crushed out competition by manipulating the livestock markets and controlling the prices both of live stock and of dressed meat . They had also secured special privileges from railroads , stockyard companies ,  | and municipalities which gave them valuable advantages over their competitors . The direct methods used by the five corporations to get control of the industry are of interest . Meat , unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its maintenance and care from the time of shipping , as live stock , until it is placed in the hands of the consumer . For other commodities railroads provide the cars necessary for transportation . But this was not true of meat . The stock cars and stockyards required for the transportation and storage of animals , it was found by the Federal Trade Commission , were centered in the hands of the five corporations . Moreover , the cold-storage plants necessary for the preservation of meat and the refrigerator cars used in its distribution ? all of the equipment , in fact , needed for the handling of meat ? were in the hands of the same packers . If an independent concern bought live stock the railroads had no depot facilities for the care of such animals until they were called for . Either the small company had to have its own stockyards for their immediate reception or it was compelled to lease stockyard space from competitors . The same situation existed in the case of transportation of both the live stock and the dressed meat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Big Five " for the purchase and distribution of its produce . At the time of this investigation the five corporations had not only reached out in either direction to control the industry from the farm to the door of the consumer , but they had also extended their control to competitive products . In 1916 Swift and Company was the largest butter distributor in the United States . The  | Big Five handled at least half of the interstate commerce in poultry , eggs , and cheese . They were also important factors in the preparation and distribution of condensed and evaporated milk and other canned products . Vegetable oils were rapidly coming under their control . They were becoming important distributors of staple groceries . Altogether it looked as if the food industries were on their way to falling into the control of five big meat packers . When the facts disclosed by the Federal Trade Commission were received by the Department of Justice it was decided that " such a degree of probability of monopoly had been established " as to warrant prosecution under the anti-trust law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agreement was reached between the attorney-general and the packers which provided for the sale of most of their allied interests . This agreement shows how extensive their activities were . In brief it includes the following : ( 1 ) to sell under the supervision of the United States district court , preferably to live-stock producers and the public , all their holdings in stockyards ; ( 2 ) to sell all their interests in market newspapers ; ( 3 ) to dispose of all their interests in public cold-storage warehouses except as needed for their own meat products ; ( 4 ) to dissociate themselves forever from all unrelated lines including wholesale and retail trade in groceries , fish , and other commodities ; ( 5 ) to abandon the use of their branch houses , route cars , and motor trucks for any other than the distribution of their own meat and dairy products ; ( 6 ) to submit perpetually to the jurisdiction of the United States district court under an injunction forbidding all the defendants from directly  | or indirectly maintaining any combination or conspiracy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or attempting to monopolize any food product in the United States or indulging in any unfair or unlawful practice . On Aug. 15 , 1921 , a bill known as the Packers and Stockyards Act was passed by Congress . It provides for the regulation of the buying of live stock in interstate and foreign commerce and for the manufacture and marketing of products derived therefrom . The regulation of dairy products , poultry , and eggs is also included . It is designed to prevent the packers from employing any unfair , unjustly discriminating , or deceptive practice which would give them advantages either in acquiring supplies or in manipulating prices . This bill met with considerable opposition from the packers , and in January , 1931 , it was modified so that greater freedom of action was obtained . Although the judge 's decision does not give packers the privilege of engaging in retail business it does leave them free to take full advantage of already existing retail outlets . Trade Associations . Although the development of our bread industry reads quite differently from that of meat it shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so successful probably lies in the inherent nature of the business . Wheat is a primary foodstuff which takes a prominent place in the diet of most countries . In our country it yields from 30 to 40 per cent of the total energy of the diet . Some countries use twice that amount . Because the United States has a surplus of wheat it competes in the world market , and its price is determined by the price of wheat in Liverpool .  | Although the government has been endeavoring to find some sound economic method of insuring the American farmer a fair return for his wheat , no such method has been found and probably will not be under our present economic system . The price of wheat therefore must be determined pretty largely by world supply and demand . Before wheat is ready for use in breadstuffs it must be ground . This is a relatively simple process and before the days of elaborate machinery practically every community had its local mill . With the development of machinery this situation has changed until now the usual milling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale , but they remain located in wheat-growing sections . The competition prevailing here has been so keen that the profits have been small . In fact , millers oftentimes rely not so much on flour as on feeds and other commodities for their profits . The milling industry has shown no indication of the formation of strong combinations , yet considerable benefit has been derived by the millers through their associations . This has consisted largely of agreements to limit production , and understandings or cooperation in fixing the various elements of the selling price . The terms under which sales may be made have also been given consideration . Price levels which exist in the milling industry are of special interest . Generally speaking , there are five levels of mill price asked for flour in the United States made in accordance with the bargaining powers of the flour buyers . The lowest price is commonly obtained in the export market because of intense competition with flours in other countries . The next higher level  | of prices is that paid by large bakeries which are in a position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been sold to them below the cost of production . The next level is the market of public eating places , and next comes that of the small neighborhood baker . At the top and in the largest market of all we find the highest price that paid by the retail grocer . In fact , it is quite probable that flour designed for household consumption carries the burden of the milling industry . The movement among bakers has been definitely directed toward strong combinations . Their failure to achieve is no doubt due in greater measure to limitations in the business than to any activity on the part of the government . In terms of value of product the growth of the baking industry was similar to that of all manufacturing products during the last half of the last century . Although its development since 1900 has greatly increased , yet in 1919 it stood fourteenth among the manufacturing industries of the United States and third among food industries . Slaughtering and meat packing came first with products valued at more than $4,000,000,000 ; flour-mill and gristmill products came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other bakery products stood third with a value of more than $1,000,000,000 . Whereas the meat industry showed definite accomplishments in the formation of successful combinations as early as 1890 , the baking industry at that time was going through a period of individual growth and expansion . Definite signs of combination appear about 1907 . At first the movement consisted chiefly of the absorption of competitive concerns in the  | same locality ; but as the movement developed , a few corporations evolved with bakeries covering a wide area . In 1926 the largest was the Continental Baking Corporation with 91 bakeries scattered throughout the United States ; the General Baking Corporation was second with 42 bakeries ; Purity Bakeries corporation came third with 33 bakeries ; and Ward Baking corporation fourth with 18 bakeries . Early in 1926 W. B. Ward , who owned considerable stock in the Continental , General , and Ward Baking corporations , organized the Ward Food Products Corporation which appeared to be a combination of the three . The Department of Justice immediately took action on the grounds that there had been violation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordingly entered by which the Ward Food Products Corporation was dissolved , and certain restraints laid upon the defendants with respect to their future activity in interstate trade . Due to the nature of the baking industry , however , the actual possibility of a monopoly in bread is slight . The initial investment required for starting a bakery is small , and it is therefore difficult to eliminate competition . If the big corporations should acquire control of the milling industry the danger of a monopoly would be greatly increased . But with all of our knowledge of cereals , flour is still far from a standardized product ; hence the hazards of baking are great . Moreover , at the present time practically 60 per cent of the bread consumed in the United States is baked in the home . That the competitive conditions prevailing among bakeries are less real than they seem is due in large part to the activities of the bakers ' associations .  | They show notable examples of success in stabilizing prices in cases of price war . Two methods of regulating the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually in the order of one cent , are made . In states where there is no law fixing the size of the loaf , however , it is more common to find the price of a given type of bread remaining fixed , with the size and weight of the loaf undergoing change . The Federal Trade Commission in an investigation of the competition and profits in bread and flour found that differences as great as 2.5 ounces in the weights of bread occur at a given price over a period of one year . Racketeering . Racketeering as it prevails in our country today is of rather recent origin . Most cities maintain it in some of its phases . It may be confined entirely to the bootleg industry . But in many cities essential commodities like food , or services like laundering , are controlled by racketeers . A racket is usually defined as any scheme of exploitation by which criminal conspirators live upon the industry of others , maintaining their hold by intimidation , terrorism , or political favoritism . Two types of rackets prevail , namely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The simon-pure is made up of professional criminals whose sole purpose it is to exploit business or employees by driving them by force into trade associations , or " unions . " As these rackets gain in strength they oftentimes become the collusive-agreement type . Here control is largely in the hands of unscrupulous business men , crooked leaders of organized labor , and dishonest politicians . They exact toll from the industry and give in return protection from competition . A selling price is set for the commodity or service , and territory is apportioned .  | If anyone sells at a lower price or if a new concern undertakes to do business in the apportioned area his delivery wagons are injured , his goods destroyed , and his business generally is wrecked . The rackets which work noisily do not maintain control of the same industry long . Public opinion becomes sufficiently aroused to release it from such control . Those which work quietly and with discretion , on the other hand , become an accepted part of the industry . It is easily possible to arouse public resentment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rid distribution of the parasite . Nevertheless it should be recognized that it performs for the unorganized industries the same service that combinations and trade associations give to meat packing , flour milling , and baking , namely , power to fix the selling price and to apportion territory . The outstanding difference between them is that in one combinations are brought about by those within the business , while in the other they are imposed from without . In the problems of consumption it is a tossup which carries the greater menace .  | FOOD LEGISLATION Not only the United States but most of the governments of the world show interest in consumption problems , especially those that pertain to food . A study of the laws and enactments of Congress and state legislatures shows pretty clearly the development of this interest in our country and the phase that has received special emphasis in each era . The first agitation was for improvement in the quality of the food supply . As long as the producer consumed his own produce or even while he sold direct to the consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vital subject of discussion . During the period of expansion , however , urbanization increased rapidly , and markets sprang up everywhere to meet the new demands . As soon as food began to pass through the hands of two or three middlemen adulteration became common practice , and demands for laws to correct the evil were loud enough to require a hearing . Moreover , science was beginning to demonstrate the close relationship between health and food . Our early laws reflect these influences . Some years later when the period of combination was well established and mergers became the recognized means of developing markets and increasing profits the federal government attempted to solve the economic problem by passing an anti-trust law and establishing the Federal Trade Commission . The  | purpose of this act is to maintain free competition in industry and is designed to aid not only the small business concern but the consumer as well , for active competition is commonly regarded as beneficial to him . Whether such a policy is wise remains for discussion in Chap . XIV . Here only the facts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps to ascertain what the problems of the consumer are and how they can best be solved . This is shown by the establishment of a bureau devoted to research in this field . The three types of legislation are discussed here . Food Laws. ? From the earliest records history has shown that the purity and wholesomeness of the food supply is a frequent subject for discussions and that man has always felt himself cheated if the foods he has purchased have been cheapened by the addition of inferior materials . Not much discussion of this subject is found in the United States until the middle of the last century . Since that time so much has been said and written , oftentimes colored by personal prejudice and self-interest , that it is difficult to judge the situation fairly and to arrive at a justifiable picture of the conditions then existing in our food industries . A few laws and decisions , however , no doubt reflect some of them . Early books deal largely with food adulterants . They are , on the whole , sensational in their disclosures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions , for instance , under which a large amount of the milk supply of New York City and Chicago was produced 75 years ago are described as most unsanitary and cruel . The cows were fed slops  | from the breweries and were subject to the most loathsome diseases . Pure Food Laws . How accurate such pictures may be is a question . Nevertheless , as a result of this agitation laws have been enacted to protect the food supply . About 50 years ago some of the states assumed responsibility for their own protection . Federal work along this line began in 1881 when the Division of Chemistry in the Department of Agriculture began the study of food adulteration . In 1883 a food-inspection law was passed in Massachusetts , and in 1884 a state dairy commissioner was appointed in New York . The quality of the food supplies received by the cities in these states began to show improvement . The foods most commonly adulterated at that time were bread , flour , butter , canned foods , cheese , cocoa , chocolate , coffee , confectionery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar , tea , spices , seasonings , and ' vinegar . Other states followed the lead of Massachusetts and New York and passed food laws of one kind or another designed to protect the quality of the food offered for sale . Before many years therefore manufacturers and producers of food entering interstate trade found that the confusion that resulted from lack of uniformity in state laws had brought intolerable hardship , and they felt that the condition could be remedied only by federal regulations which would standardize procedure . When a pure-food law was finally passed by Congress in 1906 there were food laws of various kinds in 28 states . In the hearings on the pure-food bill before the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on Feb. 13 , 1906 , a manufacturer of pickles , preserves ,  | and condiments in Detroit , Mich. , gives a good picture of the confusion and difficulties under which he worked . According to his testimony his goods were distributed largely in Michigan , Minnesota , and Wisconsin , states in which the purpose of the food laws was practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Preserves which contained glucose , for instance , were to be labeled for the Michigan market " imitation preserves " ; under the Minnesota law they were to be labeled " imitation preserves , mixture adulterated , " and the net weight of the package was to be shown ; under the Wisconsin law such preserves were to be labeled " compound glucose preserves " together with a formula stating the percentage of the various ingredients used . A customer in Duluth ordered several hundred cases of these preserves , and they were sent to him properly labeled for Minnesota trade . He shipped a case to a customer in Superior , Wis. , a trade for which they were not properly labeled . The instance was accordingly taken up by the pure-food commissioner of Wisconsin as a case of illegal labeling . Although there was a strong movement among business concerns for a federal law that would do away with conditions such as these the fight over its passage was long and bitter . It was concerned largely with the individuals in whom the power of enforcement would be vested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that period had taken toward the use of preservatives in food , the opposition to placing enforcements in its hands was particularly strong . In spite of this , however , a bill finally passed in 1906 which deals with the manufacture and labeling of any adulterated or misbranded food or drug in the terri- tories of the United States or the District of Columbia and with the interstate commerce of such foods and drugs . Moreover , the task of making uniform rules and regulations for carrying out the provisions of the law was entrusted to the secretaries of the three departments , Treasury , Agriculture , and Commerce and Labor , as it was then known , and the administration of the law was put into the hands of the Bureau of Chemistry of the Department of Agriculture . Food was defined as including " all articles used for food , drink , confectionery , or condiment by man or other animal . Under the administration of the food laws passed in the various states considerable confusion and discussion had arisen over the word adulteration . According to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be shown to have a harmful effect . In other cases it was taken to mean the addition of any inferior substance to a foodstuff for the purpose of increasing the profits of the producer . The federal law defines adulteration as the addition of any substance which lowers the quality or strength of the food or renders it injurious to health , or the substitution of any substance for the real article , or the removal of any valuable ingredient , Food containing filthy , decomposed , or putrid substances or matter obtained from diseased sources is also classed as adulterated . The law provides in addition that foods put up in package form bear a label indicating the weight , measure , or numerical count of the food enclosed . Any false or misleading statements on the label concerning the foods offered for sale are termed misbranding . Although one of the chief arguments of food producers for a federal pure-food law was the desirability  | of uniformity of such regulations in the states it was not until 1913 that conscious effort at coordination between federal and state law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and today most of the food laws and regulations of state and municipality have been brought into accord with the federal law . Upon the passage of the food and drugs act in 1906 it was necessary to work out the many details involved in its enforcement . One of the first duties was to set up standards by which to judge the quality of the food products on the market . The Bureau of Chemistry , in cooperation with the Association of Food and Dairy Officials and the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists , has in the years that have elapsed developed standards for a great number of foods . After such standards receive the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture they are published for the guidance of manufacturers and inspectors . While these have no legal value they are generally accepted as the standard for judging quality . Preservatives. ? Another subject that has received a good deal of attention in connection with food legislation is the matter of preservatives . Those against whose use opposition has been strong are borax , salicylates , benzoates , sulphites , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To determine the physiological effect of these substances when added to the diet , the Bureau of Chemistry carried on experiments over a long period of time and from their results concluded that they were harmful . The food manufacturers also spent a great deal of time and money investigating the subject , and the experts employed by them concluded from their findings that  | in the quantities usually used in preserving food most of them were harmless . Moreover , they criticised the work of the Department of Agriculture on the grounds that it had not been carried out in a scientific manner . The conditions , they pointed out , under which their preservatives were usually consumed were not maintained . In the first place the preservative was given in capsule form instead of being mixed thoroughly with foods . Furthermore , the psychological approach was criticised , for the men who volunteered to act as subjects were required to sign an agreement to the effect that they would not hold the Department of Agriculture nor any person connected therewith responsible for any illness or accident that might occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting as subjects were popularly referred to as the " poison squad . " Finally , as a result of these differences , under an order of President Roosevelt , the Secretary of Agriculture appointed a referee board of five scientific experts to investigate the action of these substances on the nutrition and health of man . The keenest fight centered around benzoate of soda . In order to get first-hand data on its effects experiments were carried out independently at Yale University under Russell H. Chittenden , at Northwestern University under John H. Long , and at the private laboratory of Christian A. Herter of Columbia University . Six subjects were studied in each of the first two experiments and four in the last . As the result of these investigations the Referee Board of Consulting Scientific Experts concluded that sodium benzoate in doses of less than 0.5 gram per day when mixed with the food is without deleterious or poisonous action and is not injurious to  | health . When larger amounts were used the results were less conclusive , but even here the men suffered no permanent ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under discussion and investigation alum , benzoate of soda , and sulphur dioxide are still used . The reasons given by food manufacturers for the need of preservatives are that some foods can not be successfully preserved without it and that it lowers the final cost to the consumer . Those opposed to their use maintain that it enables the unscrupulous manufacturer to use inferior grades of food and to preserve it under unwholesome conditions . Although the federal bill was passed in 1906 providing for certain regulations , and four amendments have been added , the fight that it created goes on with little abatement . Magazines and organizations have been formed either to fight or to promote legislation in this field . Some of the antagonists to the proposed legislation have become supporters of the movement to maintain a food supply of recognized quality . At almost every session of Congress a bill to amend the food and drug act is discussed . At the 1926 session bills were passed by both the House and the Senate which provided for the use of corn sugar in certain products without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to pass the Senate bill , and the Senate did not have time to take up the bill which was acceptable to the House . So the matter stood for future action . Although the question has never been settled by Congress , Secretary Hyde recently announced that the requirement that canned foods containing corn sugar be so labeled was rescinded . His reason for this decision was to stimulate the use of  | corn products and thus aid agriculture . Many purefood proponents feel that such a decision greatly weakens our pure-food law . The opposition here rests largely on the fact that corn sugar has much less sweetening value than cane sugar and that as a result the consumer is cheated by paying for an inferior product . Special Laws. ? The purity of our imports have also received attention . Congress in 1883 passed a law prohibiting the importation of adulterated tea . This was superseded by a more detailed regulation in 1897 . It provides for the appointment by the Secretary of Agriculture of a board of experts in tea who shall recommend " uniform standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kinds of teas imported into the United States . " Such standards are used in admitting tea into this country . From the standpoint of the consumer the most severe act on our statute books pertaining to food may be regarded as the one dealing with oleomargarine . A tax of 10 cents a pound is imposed if the product is colored to resemble butter and cent if it is uncolored . A tax of 15 cents is imposed on imported oleomargarine . In addition to these taxes an annual tax of $600 is levied on the manufacturers of oleomargarine , and taxes of $480 and $48 respectively on the wholesaler and retailer who deal in this product . If they sell only the uncolored oleomargarine the taxes imposed on the dealers are reduced somewhat more than 50 per cent . Such an act is unquestionably an example of class legislation , designed to protect the dairyman from competition with the cheaper sources of fat suitable for table use . Oleomargarine , which is a valuable food , is thus rendered much more expensive  | and inconvenient for use than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all cases in which deception of the consumer might be practiced amply provides the necessary protection without additional taxation . Three other foodstuffs , filled cheese , adulterated or renovated butter , and mixed flour , are subject to similar taxation . Meat Inspection. ? Sinclair 's " The Jungle " is commonly regarded as the final impetus that was needed to enact another important and far-reaching law passed by Congress in 1906 , that is , the law providing for federal inspection of meat . Whereas the pure-food law passed at that time provided primarily for the education of the consumer in the purity of her purchases , the meat inspection act was designed as a safeguard to health . Sinclair 's description of the conditions prevailing in packing houses is most revealing . The first laws of cleanliness were disregarded , and diseased animals passed through uncensored along with the healthy animals . What inspection there was , provided by state or municipality , was lax and oftentimes corrupt . The need of more stringent measures was readily recognized . Enforcement of the federal law is relatively simple and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture to examine , both before and after death , all cattle , sheep , swine , and goats destined to enter into interstate and foreign commerce . It is provided that any meat found to be " unsound , unhealthful , unwholesome , or otherwise unfit for human food " should be destroyed for food purposes by the packer in the presence of the inspector . If the condemned carcass is not destroyed the Secretary of Agriculture removes inspectors from that establish- ment , and the meat slaughtered there can not enter interstate or foreign commerce . The act is administered by the Bureau of Animal Industry of the Department of Agriculture . Filled Milk . In 1923 Congress declared that " filled milk " is an " adulterated article of food , injurious to the public health , and its sale constitutes a fraud upon the public . " It therefore made it unlawful for anyone to manufacture the product within any territory or possession of the United States , or within the District of Columbia , or to deliver it for shipment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defined by Congress as any milk , cream , or skimmed milk to which has been added any fat or oil other than milk fat . This includes condensed , evaporated , and dried milk as well as fresh . Standardization. ? Besides laws to protect the consumer from fraud and the unsanitary handling of food some attempts have been made to standardize foodstuffs and thus simplify the marketing problems . In 1912 a bill passed Congress for standardizing the apple market . The standard grades of apples were defined and provision made for marking barrels containing such apples in accordance with the definitions . In interstate and foreign commerce barrels marked as " standard " are considered misbranded unless they also bear a statement of the name of the variety of the apple , the name of the locality where grown , and the name of the packer or person by whose authority the apples were packed and the barrel marked . This method of labeling is now used in marketing a great number of fruits and vegetables . When the consumer becomes acquainted with the standardization movement and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only simplification of her marketing problem but also protection against the delivery of a quality of goods which she does not want and has not ordered . Federal Trade Commission. ? In addition to federal and state food laws especially designed for the protection of the food supply of the consumer there are other acts on our statute books which , although they were formulated primarily for coping with economic problems of industry , have in many instances been used indirectly to safeguard the consumer . ? The work of the Federal Trade Commission oftentimes falls in that class . This commission was created in conjunction with the latest anti-trust act . An anti-trust law has been on our statute books since 1890 , and a few spectacular cases have been tried under it . During the early years of the present century , however , the inadequacy of the old law was shown by its inability to cope with the great movement which has resulted in the integration of industries both horizontally and perpendicularly . In 1914 therefore a new law was passed called the Clayton Anti-trust Act , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions that might arise under it pertaining to the use of unfair methods of competition . In addition to such legal duties the commission is equipped with an economic division which gathers and publishes information regarding business methods of corporations and an export trade division which investigates foreign trade conditions . As in the administration of the food laws the Federal Trade Commission can handle only cases that arise in interstate commerce . Unfair methods of competition have been declared unlawful in the United States , and it is the duty of the  | Federal Trade Commission to see that they are not used . Among " unfair " methods listed appear the following : false advertising , misbranding of articles , adulteration and misrepresentation of products , bribery of buyers , false statements about one 's competitor 's products , sale of goods below cost in order to hamper small competitors in the business , and trade boycotts . It is easy to set the machinery of the Clayton Antitrust Act in motion . Anyone may complain to the Federal Trade Commission that a specified business concern is using unfair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine whether the concern carries on interstate business , whether it is hampering free competition , and , if so , whether the public interest is affected . When such a state is indicated the application goes to a commission which if it agrees with the interpretation of the evidence submitted recommends that a complaint be issued . The commission issues a complaint , and the respondent is called on to disprove or defend the practice . After 30 days or more , hearings are begun and full testimony of both sides is given . If the commission after hearing the report of the examiner believes that the methods used by the respondent were unfair it issues an order that the respondent cease from the use of such practices . If the methods are to be continued the matter becomes one for the courts to handle . Bureau of Home Economics. ? Beside legislative action in the interests of the consumer Congress has also established a bureau in the U. S. Department of Agriculture in which the work is devoted exclusively to studies dealing with consumption . The evolution of  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started about 1880 in what was called the Office of Home Economics . It did not become a bureau until 1923 . Early work in this field was initiated by W. O. Atwater and consisted of studies of the dietary habits in the United States . Under his careful direction records of food consumption were collected from all parts of the country and analyzed for their protein , fat , and carbohydrate content . Little was known in those days of food analysis , and it therefore became necessary in order to analyze the diets to collect and analyze a great number of foods . This included the determination of refuse , water , protein , fat , carbohydrate , and total ash . The work which went forward slowly for about 25 years not only marks an important period in the history of nutrition but represents the pioneering on which all of the later studies in consumption are based . Out of this early work of the Office of Home Economics developed two results which are of fundamental importance to the consumer . The first was the ascertainment of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it was possible to set up standards of nutritional needs . Based on these studies Atwater concluded , for instance , that a diet yielding 3,400 calories and containing 125 grams of protein per man per day was adequate to supply the nutritive needs of a moderately active man . As has been shown , the standards for these nutrients in common use today are somewhat lower than those suggested by Atwater , and other nutrients are now recognized as essential , yet his work marks an important recognition of one of the fundamental  | problems of the consumer ? how much and what kind of food is needed to insure her family an adequate diet . The second result of Atwater 's work was the publication in 1899 of his bulletin The Chemical Composition of American Food Materials , a publication which until very recently has been used in many countries as the chief source of our knowledge of the composition of foods . After Dr. Atwater 's death in 1907 the work of the Office of Home Economics was devoted largely to the development of recipes which might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of the bulletins published during this period are of value in pointing out methods of expanding the diet and at the same time cutting down the food budget . In 1923 the Bureau of Home Economics was created . During the 7 years of its activity it has shown most satisfying growth not only in personnel but also in interests , and its possibilities as an essential factor in meeting consumer problems become daily more apparent . Until this bureau was created the interests of home economists centered chiefly around problems in nutrition and in the preparation of food for the table . The breadth of the field of consumption is today being recognized , and the bureau reflects this diversity of interests by its three divisions , namely , foods and nutrition , economics , and textiles and clothing . Its work in foods and nutrition includes not only the preparation of foods on a scientific basis but also studies of their vitamin content and a comprehensive revision of Atwater 's bulletin on the chemical composition of foods . In the division of economics studies  | are being made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups and the amount of time required for performing household duties . Investigations of the efficiency and value of household equipment to the consumer are also made in this division . The work of the division of textiles and clothing consists chiefly of investigations of the performance and standardization of fabrics and the development of suitable designs for children 's clothing and for household furnishings . The results of investigations such as these are needed as a basis for guiding the consumer in her utilization of wealth so that she may derive therefrom the greatest value in terms of welfare .  | HEALTH VERSUS FOOD MANUFACTURE The close relationship between health and food habits is so commonly recognized today that a discussion of it might seem superfluous . Before dismissing the factors that affect food consumption , however , it is important to consider the possible influence of our present methods of food manufacture on the nation 's health . Though the situation as it exists today is regarded by many as more than balanced by the variety of the American diet , yet the results of food manufacture must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have been given in this book would lead one to question whether variety in the diet is as universal as we like to think . The trend today in the marketing of food is toward purification and storage so that losses due to deterioration may be reduced to a minimum and the supply stabilized . The latter would include the various methods of preservation in common practice . This means a radical change from the situation as it existed in the time of our grandmothers when practically all of the economic functions pertaining to the food supply were performed in the home . In those days live stock was raised , slaughtered , preserved by the use of salt or smoke , and stored for the family 's use . Wheat and corn were grown on the farm , ground at the nearest mill , and made into bread by the housewife . Milk was produced on the place and used raw ,  | some of it being made into butter and cheese . Eggs and poultry were home grown . Sugar was a luxury kept for gala days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juice made into sirup or molasses . Fruits and vegetables came from the garden or from the cellar where they had been stored for winter use . Our grandmothers knew nothing of the science of nutrition , but the nutritional disorders that are so prevalent today were no doubt of less import then because the foods that we have found so essential for health and normal development were usually amply provided . Furthermore , these foods were used in Coto . None of the essential portions was discarded because it created an economic problem which cut down the profits of business . And yet it is possible today to find educators in high repute who object to the introduction of nutrition and food problems into the curriculum because the subject is of no importance . " Our grandmothers , " they say , " had no trouble with nutritional disorders . They knew nothing of the science of nutrition , yet their families were well fed . It 's just a passing fad . Yesterday it was calories ; today it is vitamins . I guess we can safely rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we cheerfully go ahead with 2 per cent of the rural families in the South normally suffering from pellagra ; with rickets a common disorder among the infants of our cities ; with nutritional anemia occurring frequently in both city and country ; and with ulcers and stomach disorders on the increase . The correction of such a condition is possible only through the education of the consumer , not only in nutritional values but in methods and effects of food manufacture as well .  | The losses that occur in our modern methods of food manufacture are classed in this chapter as tangible and intangible . The former for a long time have been regarded as a vital nutritional problem ; the importance of the latter is only beginning to be recognized . Tangible Losses in Food Manufacture. ? Among the foods undergoing nutritional losses during the process of manufacture the cereals come first not only because of their importance in the diet but more especially because of the extent of loss to which they are subjected . The grains commonly appearing in the American diet are wheat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of the consumer about 30 per cent of the grain is removed . This includes the bran and germ ? the parts vital to germination which contain valuable minerals and vitamins . The portion that goes into human consumption consists largely of carbohydrate together with a small amount of protein and fat . The discarded portions of wheat are rich in the antipellagric and antisterility vitamins , called G and E , and those of corn and rice are valuable as sources of the antineuritic vitamin , or F. The minerals especially important in these portions are phosphorus and iron . Cereals furnish from 30 to 40 per cent of the energy of the American diet , yet the portions of the grain containing the essential minerals and vitamins are discarded before it is offered for human consumption . Such a practice no doubt results in deficient diets in many a household . The reasons for this disposal are largely economic . The germ and the outer layers of the grain contain oils which rapidly undergo deterioration resulting in  | rancidity . The bread baked from flour containing these portions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to standardize . Moreover , the American public demands bread that is light and spongy in texture . Europeans call it cake . Such bread is more readily made from the inner layers of the grain consisting chiefly of carbohydrate and protein than it is from the whole grain . Although bread standards of the American diet are in line with milling practices , nevertheless the question whether these by-products should be put back into the diet is a live one today . Milling concerns have their machinery designed for refined flour and they are carrying on a strong campaign against any change in the type of flour demanded . To meet a different demand would mean extended readjustments in their milling and marketing habits . The proLlem is unquestionably economic as well as nutritional , but instead of trying to solve it with intelligence it is treated emotionally . Advocates line up on one side or the other . The gist of the appeal made by those who favor the use of whole wheat is , " Eat whole wheat or die . " The arguments that come from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food cranks who know nothing of the fundamentals of nutrition . One constructive argument , however , has been put forward by those who support the present milling custom . They claim that since the bran and germ are sold as feed for dairy cattle they are not wasted . They now reach us via the cow through the milk . Since milk is such a valuable food it would therefore mean a real loss to the American diet if the germ and bran of wheat were put back into the flour . Of course ,  | in such an argument one loses sight of the other grains which are available for animal feeding . Moreover , the consumer following such advice would purchase the essential factors at greatly increased cost , for it is commonly recognized that , expressed in terms of energy , he recovers in the form of milk only about onethird of the feed necessary to produce it . As was stated above , our forbears raised sorghum and cane from which they made molasses sirup . Today when we want these commodities we go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products brings out important differences . The sirup made directly from the cane and sorghum juices contains important minerals which are of value in a diet of the pellagra-producing type found in the South , namely corn meal , fat-back , and sirup . Most of the sirup obtainable in the market today is derived as a by-product in sugar production or is made up largely of glucose a hydrolization product of starch . In either case their nutritive content , other than carbohydrate , is practically nil . Intangible Losses in Food Manufacture. ? The losses in food value that have just been described are easy to recognize . For instance , anyone can see the 30 per cent of bran and germ removed from human consumption . The intangible losses , on the other hand , occur during processes of manufacture and can be detected only through careful studies of the effect of foods subjected to such changes on the growth and well-being of small animals . The manufacturing processes chiefly responsible for essential losses in food are bleaching , canning , and pasteurization . Extended storage and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutritive value of foods .  | Bleaching . The housewife prefers her flour , dried fruit , mushrooms , celery , lettuce , and , some say , butter of a light and attractive hue . Meeting this demand is sometimes left to nature ; more often it is accomplished by artificial bleaching . The result of such treatment is a food of lower nutritive value but with better keeping qualities . Many foods contain pigments essential for health , but which deteriorate readily spoiling the product for human consumption . Such pigments therefore become a vital economic problem . Flour gives a good example of the situation . Flour on standing naturally whitens , and the baking qualities desired by the American public are greatly improved . This is a slow process , however , and chemical means are usually employed to accomplish in a few minutes what nature does over a period of months . The chemicals in common use are chlorine or some of the peroxides . The yellow pigment in flour is known as carotin and is in some way associated with vitamin A , a factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and subjected to the conditions of bleaching it readily oxidates to some more stable compound . At the same time the growth-promoting value of such foods is lessened . What the exact tie-up between carotin and vitamin A is has not been proved , but there is very good evidence that an essential factor for growth is destroyed during the bleaching process . Since it is possible by the use of a bleaching agent to restore weather-stained or damaged grain to a semblance of that of good quality the pure-food law is rather specific on this point . Bleached flour is admitted into interstate trade , but it is regarded as  | adulterated if the bleaching has reduced its quality or strength or if it has been employed to conceal the use of damaged or inferior grain . In any case the package must be branded to indicate artificial bleaching . The situation with the other foods undergoing a bleaching process to meet the consumer 's tastes is very similar to that of flour . Besides losses in nutritive value there are unjustifiable economic losses as well . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain having excellent characteristics except color is discriminated against , and it must either go into feed for cattle or be discarded . Lettuce gives a similar example . Although experimentation has shown that the green leaves are more effective than white in producing growth and health yet the compact white heads are the only ones to be found in our markets today . Canning and Storage. ? During the canning and storage of fruits and vegetables , losses again occur in the nutritive value of foods . The cause here is heat and oxidation , and the factors chiefly affected are vitamins C and F , the vitamins which protect against scurvy and beriberi . Tomatoes are an outstanding example of a food rich in vitamin C not injured by this process . This is the reason canned tomatoes are recommended in infant feeding to supplement the usual milk diet . Pasteurization. ? Milk introduces a unique problem in our economic life today . It is recognized as a food of unusual value because of its mineral and vitamin content , and its use is accordingly stressed by nutritionists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the development of pathological organisms , and  | bacteriologists frown upon all milk which is not produced and distributed under the most sanitary conditions . Milk standards therefore have been adopted in practically all of the states . They include a minimum requirement for butter fat and a maximum allowance for bacterial content . Moreover , the health of the cows and of the men engaged in dairies is under the supervision of the state or municipality . To insure further the health of the consumer most of the milk used in our cities is pasteurized . That is , it is heated to a temperature between 140 and 145 ? F. for 20 to 30 minutes , thus destroying any pathogenic organisms that may be present . A slight loss in nutritive value results consisting largely of vitamins C and B. In this case , however , the protection afforded the consumer against unsanitary handling of milk probably compensates for the losses that occur . Use of Preservatives. ? An interesting case that recently came before the Federal Trade Commission was that against the Royal Baking Powder Company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the procedure of the commission 's activities as well as the benefit its work may be to the consumer . But more particularly the case in point ties up closely with the use of preservatives in food and gives valuable data concerning their influence on the diet . The recent investigation dealt with the use of alum . In 1920 at the instigation of manufacturers of baking powder containing alum , a formal complaint was issued by the Federal Trade Commission against the Royal Baking Powder Company , charging unfair methods of competition . These included public statements made by this company that baking powders  | containing alum were objectionable and that its own baking powder contained no alum . Hearings , started in the latter part of 1923 , were continued for about , a year and a half and consisted almost entirely of evidence concerning the biological effects of alum when used in small amounts . In order to prepare such evidence a vast amount of experimental work was carried out which is of importance to consumers . It represents the most exhaustive investigation that has been made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of baking powder alum is not a preservative but a cheap acid ingredient used with sodium bicarbonate for the formation of carbon dioxide , the gas employed to leaven breads and pastries . It is nevertheless used in preserving fish and pickles , and its effects here would no doubt be the same . Alum is an inorganic salt containing aluminum , an element probably foreign to the animal organism . The experiments , designed to ascertain its biological effects , include studies of its action on cells , blood , plants , and animals . Important among them are feeding experiments in which rats , mice , guinea pigs , and dogs daily received biscuits leavened with an alum baking powder over a long period of time . The results of the studies point to the possibility of destructive action on some of the vitamins important for growth and health . The fact that the trial examiner , after listening to all of the evidence presented , concluded that there are " substantial grounds upon which to predicate an honest opinion " that alum in the diet is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant results of such an investigation are the awakening of a p 227 social responsibility for the protection of the diet . It is to be hoped that in the light of these studies a comprehensive and unbiased examination of the biological effects of all of the preservatives used in the preparation of foods will be made . As has been shown , the food industries in their methods of manufacture and storage tend more and more to turn out foods with their original nutrients greatly reduced and in some cases entirely removed . To what extent our preservatives are responsible for similar deterioration is a point that needs careful examination . Manufacturers ' Attempts to Meet Problem. ? A few manufacturing concerns recognize that man lives not by food but by the nutrients it contains and are taking steps to protect the food supply . Whether the methods that are being adopted will have real value in improving the diet remains for the future to determine . They consist chiefly of introducing vitamin D into food and of protecting the highly unstable vitamins from oxidation . Vitamin D , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that some foods totally lacking in the vitamin have the property of acquiring it when exposed to sunlight or ultraviolet light . This is due to the presence of a compound known as ergosterol which , when treated with ultra-violet rays , becomes a most effective antirachitic agent . Irradiated ergosterol is frequently used in infant feeding for the prevention or cure of rickets . Irradiation of natural foods is becoming recognized by industry as a possible means of increasing the vitamin D content of the food supply , and certain foods subjected to such treatment are now on the market .  | The destruction of many of the essential pigments and vitamins in food is brought about through oxidation . It is reasoned , and correctly , that if the manipulation or heating of a food takes place in an atmosphere free from oxygen oxidation does not occur . This fact is used to advantage by some industries to protect the unstable nutrients . To obtain evaporated milk the process of evaporation takes place in a vacuum at a temperature of about 130 ? F. This results in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one-half of its water has been removed . The same principle is involved in the preparation of a small amount of butter and ice cream which is on the market called Heathized . Manipulation of the products used in making these foods occurs in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide . Food Fallacies. ? Before leaving this discussion of the effect of manufacture on the nutritive value of food , a word about the food fads of today is not out of place their reason for being , their value , and their danger to the individual . How large a following the various feeding regimens have is unknown , but the fact that Dr. Kellogg of Battle Creek Sanatarium has built up a national reputation on his food program and that Mr. MacFadden has built up a huge magazine business on his ideas of food taboos would indicate that the idea makes a strong appeal to the American public . Furthermore , the frequency with which one meets a food " crank " and his insistence on being taken seriously argue that the number is not small . The earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascribed to Moses for the Jewish race . The regimen was made an integral part of their religion and remains intact even today among orthodox  | Jews . The explanation given of its origin probably has weight . It is based largely on the assumption that in Moses ' day the animals on the taboo list were subject to disease or obtained from polluted streams so that they were a menace to the health of man . That is probably true of prohibited meats , but what about the law that milk and meat shall not only not be eaten at the same meal but that they shall not be cooked and served in the same utensils ? Such a law requires the Jewish family to own two full sets of equipment . Its origin , which is said to be based on the command that a kid shall not be seethed in its mother 's milk , sounds more like a response to sentiment than to a health requirement . The Catholics also prescribe the foods that shall be substituted for meat on certain days . The rules for preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore do not bring about the same complexities as does the Jewish diet . The fads and fallacies that have grown up in the secular world divide , on the whole , into four groups , namely , vegetarians , raw-food advocates , singlenutrient-at-a-meal followers , and roughage adherents . Vegetarians as a rule draw a close line between the animal and vegetable origin of foods , using only those from a vegetable source . This group has been more or less common throughout the history of man . Its development in the beginning was probably brought about by the difficulty encountered in keeping meats before modern methods of preservation were discovered and the danger to health in eating tainted meat . In more recent times the argument for a meatless diet usually rests on the cruelty-to-animal appeal . There are , moreover , prominent leaders in  | nutrition who think that a diet high in meat is detrimental to health . A second group claims that the salvation of the world rests in the use of raw foods . They would do away entirely with the cooking of food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitamins and pigments are destroyed in the process of cooking . Furthermore , foods cooked in water lose some of the mineral salts or other nutrients . A third group advocates the importance of not mixing nutrients in the same meal . That is , one meal should contain largely protein , another carbohydrate , and so on . The idea originated in all probability in the fact that the nutrients require varying periods of time for stomach digestion . But since only a small part of the digestive process is carried out in the stomach , the extra work in planning a regimen designed to cooperate with stomach digestion seems wasted . The importance of roughage in the diet is featured by a fourth group . They advocate the need of putting the bran and germ of cereals back into the human diet . Volumes have been written on both sides of this subject . As was stated above , the milling interests are actively fighting the idea with all the power they possess . Nutritionists interested in the welfare of the consumer are divided in their opinion . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They involve perfectly good principles in nutrition . Moreover , the present trends in food manufacture toward the destruction of essential nutrients would recommend especially the generous use of raw foods and the restoration of the outer layers and germ of the grains to our bread supply .  | Since the economic problems involved in the latter are real this would be more satisfactorily accomplished if the baker or housewife would add them independently to the dough than if the miller attempted to grind the grain as a whole . To meet the food problem intelligently , however , fads and fallacies are quite inadequate . They tend to become absolute and to rule the unthinking individual with an iron hand . Food consumption becomes an expression of morality . To eat this food is right ; to eat that food is wrong . The former results in good , and the latter in evil . The dogmatism and missionary zeal which we meet in individuals pledged to a given food regimen offers no solution to the problem . Rather the consumer must become familiar with nutritional values and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet . She will then be in a position to judge the situation calmly and to choose the foods that will supply her family 's needs . She will , moreover , be able to take her rightful place in guiding industry and science in the interests of her nation 's health and prosperity .  | THE CONSUMER 'S RESPONSIBILITY More than 80 per cent of the families in the United States today have an income of less than $2,000 a year . The average for this group is about $1,000 . Of this amount practically all goes to meet the standards of living which we , in our modern civilization , have set up . Little is left for savings and improvement in their financial condition . The items demanding this income are food , housing , clothing , and miscellaneous expenditures , such as household supplies , personal services , and recreation . It has , moreover , been shown that in this group food requires 40 per cent or more of the income . With these figures at hand it is possible to estimate the size of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 per cent amounts to 96,000,000 individuals , or 20,000,000 families . To provide them an average income of $1,000 would accordingly require $20,000,000,000 of the national income . If 40 per cent of this is necessary to supply their food needs it means that $8,000,000,000 is spent annually by this group for food alone . Calculated by the average cost of the American diet given in Chap . VI , namely $158 per man per year , a sum in excess of $8,000,000,000 is obtained which is probably more nearly correct in showing the purchasing power of this group .  | The 1920 census stated that among the food industries of the United States meat packing came first with products valued at somewhat more than $4,000,000 , - 000 ; flour-mill and grist-mill products were valued at about $2,000,000,000 ; and bread and bakery products at $1,000,000,000 . The food-consumption industry as carried on by 80 per cent of the families is therefore in excess of these three manufacturing industries combined . It is twice the size of the largest the meat-packing industry . If the sum spent by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than three times the value of that industry . Food consumption is beyond doubt the biggest business in our country today . Its administration is in the hands of about 25,000,000 housewives who know practically nothing of the problems involved . They know what foods they are accustomed to and like , but the value of these , in terms of welfare , both nutri- tionally and economically , is a sealed book to them . And yet if the production and distribution of food are ever to become activities carried on in the interests of the consumer it will be necessary for the housewives to acquaint themselves with their business so that they can consciously guide such activities . Present Methods of Creating Demand. ? Ultimate demand , it can not be denied , rests in the hands of the consumer , and many writers on the subject take pleasure in pointing out that the consumer in reality guides and directs the destiny of industry . They neglect to show , however , that the stimulus directly responsible for creating much of this demand arises in industry , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific commodities is appalling . In Coto it runs into billions of dollars , very little of  | which contributes any help to the consumer in meeting her problem more satisfactorily . The results of this huge expenditure are rather to confuse her and make her feel that the problems confronting her are too complex for one poor simple soul to solve . Or possibly she is not so much overwhelmed by their complexity as the economist who writes on the consumption problem . Taken as a whole the demand for food is inelastic . The diet of a moderately active man can not vary far from 3,000 calories per day if he is to maintain health and well-being . If it goes far below that amount he becomes emaciated and unable to meet his activity demands . If it exceeds that figure very much he becomes obese , and activity is cut down through sheer weight . By and large , therefore , the American diet clings rather closely to this figure , and the " Buy more bread " or " Buy more meat " campaigns , if successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in the substitution of one food for another . As was shown in the chapter dealing with changing food habits the trend in recent years has been toward a decreased consumption of wheat . When the milling and baking concerns awoke to this fact an expensive and vigorous campaign was instituted to restore wheat to its rightful place in the diet . Why ? To promote the welfare and well-being of the consumer ? No . To see the demand for their products falling off distressed them and this demand must be recreated at all costs . A recent cigarette advertising campaign that threatened one of the food industries is of interest in this connection . The slogan was " Reach for a Lucky instead of a sweet " ? a direct appeal to substitution .  | Psychologically and nutritionally it had merits . America 's sweet-consuming capacity is frequently shown by impressive statistics , and it does not require statistics to impress one with the tendency especially among the leisure class toward increased weight and plumpness . With the slender figure in vogue the saneness of this appeal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America craves activity for hands and taste buds . Many of the inhibitions and taboos imposed by civilization have found expression through food indulgences and as long as physical activity remained adequate to rid the system of a more than generous diet , all was well . But with sedentary habits increasing difficulties have set in . The cigarette advertisement therefore met a live issue by providing activity for hands and taste buds without at the same time providing energy for increased weight when it suggested that one reach for a Lucky instead of a sweet . The sugar and candy industries were so hard hit by this advertisement that they thereupon undertook- an extensive campaign , enlisting even the aid of the churches , to help restore sweets to their rightful place in the American diet , and the Federal Trade Commission was finally called upon to stop this advertisement on the grounds of unfair competition . If instead of thus acting negatively in this fight for supremacy over the consumer 's demand the " sweets " industry had gone to the style maker and induced him to create an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of obesity , the force of the cigarette advertisement would have been killed overnight , and the demand for sweets would have doubled . The examples described here give some idea of how effective the consumer is in guiding and controlling  | industry . The truth is rather that she no sooner gets her consumption problem adjusted to her satisfaction than new high-power salesmanship attacks her from all sides , and she has to go through a period of adjustment if she would keep up with the " best " in the world of consumption . This pressure is constant , every avenue of approach being used . The leading newspapers and magazines of the country devote 50 per cent or more of their space to advertisements and these in turn dictate the editorial policy of the paper . The radio keeps the air buzzing with high-power salesmanship . A ride into the country for air and change of scenery usually yields only the familiar insistence on the importance of this commodity or that to our happiness . Altogether therefore the possibility of the consumer 's guiding and controlling supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the energy will no doubt continue to be supplied by meat , milk , eggs , cheese , butter , lard , cereals , sugar , and potatoes , but the shifts possible within the group are wide . Meat may yield 15 per cent of the total energy today , and tomorrow through intensive and effective advertising it may be increased to 20 per cent . But a careful examination of the situation would reveal that milk or some other food in the group was now supplying 5 per cent less energy than it formerly did . Another type of substitution is also possible . The particular foodstuff does not lose its place in the diet , but a change is made in the brand used . The demand for Bond bread may be shifted to one for Ward 's . Or Sheffield 's evaporated milk may be used at the expense of Carnation evaporated milk . This type of substitution carries less potential danger to the con- sumer than the one that results in the substitution of another foodstuff . For what difference does it make to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread or another ? At the same time that advertising holds the reins of our economic life , scientific research moves quietly forward . Much of the work is done for the pure joy of investigating . But as a by-product in this field results are oftentimes obtained which point to definite possibilities in improving food habits if only the facts were generally known . Even here , however , the advertiser is the one who searches out the facts , and if they are of value to industry he brings them to the consumer 's attention . Most of the knowledge the housewife has of vitamins has come to her through advertisements . She is urged to eat two or three cakes of yeast daily because yeast contains vitamins B and D. Liver is an unusually good source of some of the nutrients such as iron and vitamins A and D. And so calves ' liver which in former times had practically no sale value soars to 65 or 70 cents per pound . On the basis of nutritional experiments with milk dairy associations are pressing increased consumption . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good ; some is bad . But what consumer is able to judge of their merits ? Wastes in Consumption . The wastes that occur in the present methods of consumption are enormous . Leaving out all consideration of those inherent in competition and those resulting from speculation and inefficiency in industry and confining ourselves directly to those for which the consumer is responsible , we find wastes which account for a fair proportion of the  | spread in price occurring between the farm and the consumer . With the present demand for a supply close at hand to choose from there are , it is estimated , an average of one retail store to every 25 families . The housewife is erratic in her demand , and knowing nothing about the gluts that may occur in the market she does nothing to help solve this problem of supply . Each store carries expensive overhead , and if it includes delivery of goods among its services there is much duplication of service in the neighborhood . Milk gives an excellent example of the wastes present in industry which the consumer might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has shown none of the attempts at large-scale operation to be found in other food industries . The milk consumed by urban families is usually produced on farms within a radius of about 100 miles . It is a highly perishable commodity , and within 40 hours after milking it is delivered at the door ready for consumption . As a rule , the housewife uses all of it before the day is over , for she knows that the same amount will be delivered the following morning , and otherwise it may spoil on her hands . Milk goes from the farms directly to the receiving station where it is pasteurized , cooled , and bottled for delivery . Each city has two or more large companies which perform this function , and the competition between them is frequently real . They furnish the bottles in which milk is delivered , and they quite largely carry the burdens of delivery and credit . In serving a neighborhood it requires as many delivery wagons together with driver and necessary equipment as there are milk companies in the city .  | Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the distance up and down is covered by each in order to insure the inhabitants ' receiving their milk for the day . Every morning the same duplication of distance occurs . Moreover , once a week or once a month the same duplication is made in order to collect for the milk that has been left at all these doors . Bottle destruction is another source of waste . As long as a driver finds his own bottles empty outside the door he willingly carries them back to the plant for further use . But if he finds those belonging to another company they can remain at the door until the end of time or until the consumer in sheer desperation at the resulting disorder throws them into the garbage can . Thus two types of waste result labor and material . The former has been under criticism for a long time , and studies have shown that the cost of delivery and sales collection could be cut in half if the labor involved here were centralized so that only one driver and one set of equipment were used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to centralize this service . Moreover , the centering of ownership and responsibility for all bottles together with cooperation on the part of the consumer in caring for them properly and returning them promptly would cut down the cost of bottle upkeep to about one-third its present cost . Some cities have endeavored to meet this loss by the establishment of clearing houses . The bottles of the milk companies belonging to the clearing house are picked up and delivered by the drivers to the central house where they are sorted and restored to their owners . This is good as far as it goes , but the com- panies which do not belong of course do not profit by this service , and their bottles are allowed to stand on the doorstep until the housewife destroys them . In the cities where clearing houses have been instituted therefore the fullest possible savings are not obtained . Moreover , the cost of this added service is such that it brings little benefit to the consumer in the form of a lower price for milk . Centralization is the remedy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for milk are also to be found in that of other foodstuffs . Many bakeries carry on a house-to-house delivery of bread . Here the situation is similar to that of milk . Although it is not so apparent , the same thing is true of the groceries and meat delivered at the door . And in addition to the duplication of services there is duplication of commodities in two stores side by side purchased by the retailer at increased price because the quantity is small . All of these wastes lie within the realm of consumption and are directly attributable to the consumer 's method of carrying on her business . Solution of the Consumer 's Problem. ? The consumer 's food problem is to furnish her family an adequate and satisfactory diet at the lowest reasonable price . The facts set forth in this book show that the first requirement is now being met by the average housewife . Some of the nutrients , however , just meet the standard we accept as adequate , and if anything occurs to reduce these the diet would be greatly impaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minerals and vitamins . And these are the factors most frequently destroyed or removed by our modern methods of food manufacture .  | The present trend in America today is no doubt toward an inadequate diet . To provide food at the lowest reasonable price is the second desire of the housewife , and here she usually feels that she is in the hands of powers greater than she can control . She can shop around and make the best purchase the market affords . This is a timeconsuming activity , however , and she doubts if the money she has saved is justified . She knows practically nothing of the factors that affect price . That approximately 60 per cent of the money she spends for food goes into its handling after it leaves the farm means nothing to her . She is not even curious about where this huge sum goes . And yet if she is ever to become an intelligent consumer , knowing her business thoroughly and conducting it efficiently , it is necessary for her to become familiar with these facts and to find some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribute to her welfare . The method by which she will accomplish this follows closely in the footsteps of industry generally . It means cooperation , combination , trade association ? whatever the name chosen , the purpose is the same . The farmer is coming more and more to see that if he would hold his own in the economic world he must form cooperatives to find markets for his produce . Some powerful cooperatives of this kind are now to be found in the United States , which through skillful advertising and standardization have increased the demand for their produce many times . The food industries use the same method and some of them control not only the purchase and sale of their own product but those of allied foods as well .  | Although our government rigidly adheres to the principle of free competition , this can not have much weight in our economic growth because it imposes a wasteful and inefficient procedure which intelligence can not support . The duplication of services and overhead under a system of competition and the vast sums that must go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own the business now going to a competitor only results in higher costs of living . Material savings are certainly made possible when industry combines . A careful study of the situation as it exists today would no doubt show that very little , if any , of the savings that have been made here have been passed on to the consumer . The reason for this lies in her ignorance and indifference to the problem and in her ineffective methods of making her demands known . If the consumer hopes to have any share in determining how much her food is going to cost she will have to follow the trends of the day and unite to make an effective demand . The cooperatives of England show what can be done by the consumer in meeting this problem . The cardinal principles of successful cooperation are laid down . The families which have united to perform for themselves some of the functions of the middleman have profited materially . The movement , moreover , is so strong there that it has unquestionably modified the operations of distribution to such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the American consumer has no desire to go into the business of production and distribution she can still accomplish the same ends . The consumer is  | economically the most powerful group in the country , its purchasing power far exceeding that of any single industry . If the 25,000,000 or more housewives who are responsible for making known the wants of 120 , - 000,000 individuals unite first in ascertaining what foods contribute to their welfare and then in demanding that they be delivered efficiently and without waste , the food industry , including production , distribution , and consumption , would become of real service to mankind .
