One night last week in the 105th Field Artillery Armory in The Bronx a weary group of men turned up their visors , pushed back their chairs on which they had been sitting for 24 days . They had just completed a count of 2,013,101 ballots . It had been going on since November 5 , the longest and biggest counting job ever undertaken in any U. S. city . New York had replaced its old board of aldermen with a new city council , and the council 's members were the first city officials ever to be elected by proportional representation . A few days before , counters in the four other boroughs had finished their share of the job . The preferential ballot is conceived so that if a voter 's first choice candidate fails to win , his vote is counted for his second or third choice candidate until the offices up for contest are filled . One of the last candidates to be eliminated in The Bronx was Headmaster Frank S. Hackett of the Riverdale Country School . Exulted defeated Schoolmaster Hackett : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . The system is here to stay . " <P> To other New Yorkers , their first experiment with " P. R. " seemed last week a little puzzling . In the first dragging days of the count , official action had to be taken against soldiering on the part of the 1,778 counters and officials whose salaries , ranging from $10 to $30 a day , finally ran the cost of the count to a staggering $850,000 . And although P. R. was adopted last year as a reform measure to enfranchise minorities and protect them against Tammany domination , it had not only disfranchised that 16% of the voters who could not understand the ballots but had given the Democrats , snowed under by 450,000 votes for Fusionist Fiorello H. LaGuardia in the mayoralty race , a majority of 14 of the council 's 26 members . Having earnestly supported the scheme before the election , the tabloid Daily News last week expressed its disillusionment with characteristic spice : " Unlike our contemporaries , we can make mistakes . ... P. R. as operated here smells . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defeated candidates himself , P. R. 's " father , " public-spirited Chemist William Jay Schieffelin , and such P. R. enthusiasts as Liberal Lawyer Morris Ernst remained stubbornly faithful to their device . They pointed out that with experienced counters Cincinnati had cut its counting time to a week and Cleveland to three days . If the city would authorize the voting machines for which Tammany 's late board of estimate refused to appropriate $2,000.000. they claimed that P. R. ballots might be disposed of in one day . That Tammany was as overrepresented as it seemed , they also denied , recalling that two years ago the Democrats elected 95% of the aldermen with 66% of the vote , that in 1931 the 35% of non-Democratic voters got only one alderman out of 65 . It was also probably true that many Democrats voted for the Fusion mayor . Democratic councilmen.
