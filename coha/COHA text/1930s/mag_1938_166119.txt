In two Midwest States where major political battles were heading toward a showdown last week , rank &; file newsmen tossed away their press cards and got up on the stump . And in both cases they found themselves trying to outshout their own publishers . <P> In Minnesota , where Farmer-Labor Governor Elmer Austin Benson has been branded a friend of " Reds " in his campaign for reelection , most of the newspapers have frankly slanted news and headlines to favor his youthful , gladhanding , Republican opponent , Harold E. Stassen . ( A notable exception : the Cowles-owned Minneapolis Star . ) The angry Governor did not help matters by declaring that every daily paper in the State was a liar except the Willmar ( Kandiyohi County ) Tribune ( circulation : 4,562 ) . Ordinary newshawks took this as a slur at their bosses rather than themselves , gratefully remembered that friendly Elmer Benson as a U. S. Senator had given them interviews even while he was taking a bath . <P> Last week a committee of 51 reporters , copyreaders , rewritemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by publishing a pink-covered campaign booklet called " Deadline , " crammed with the pro-Benson opinions their papers did not want . First edition ran to 100,000 copies . Excerpts : " We 've written about Gov . Elmer Benson for two years . We know he is going forward . . . . The Red menace was a red herring . And smelled even fishier . . . . " <P> Most laudatory passages in " Deadline , " however , were from Benson obituary notices which reporters swiped from their publishers ' newspaper morgues . Typical hold-for-death quotes from anti-Benson newspapers : " Elmer A. Benson will go down in history as one of Minnesota 's outstanding Governors . . . . Governor Benson displayed courage , forcefulness , and never yielded in his fight to aid the common man . . . . Even his enemies called him great . . . . " <P> Only reported reprisal against committee members last week was the temporary dropping of bylines of two sports writers by the Minneapolis Journal . All " Deadline " authors were Guildsmen , though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This week Governor Benson 's newshawk friends scored a scoop on their own papers when George W. Kelley , their Duluth cochairman , received the following wire from Franklin Roosevelt : " If the political writers on Minnesota papers are inferring that I have deliberately withheld approval from or disapproved candidacy of your Progressive Governor for reelection , they are of course misinterpreting my attitude . I have repeatedly indicated the high esteem in which I hold Governor Benson . . . . " <P> In Michigan , the Detroit Newspaper Guild set another precedent when it bought space in the arch-Republican Free Press for a political ad . ' ' REPORTERS KNOW ! " clarioned the Guild . " We have mingled with men and women in the breadlines . . . witnessed big taxpayers ' vain attempts to shirk . . . . Frank Murphy MUST Be Re-Elected ! " On its front page the Free Press testily explained it had taken the Guild 's money only because it believes in freedom of the press , opined that most Detroit newspapermen " are not led by the nose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
