PROTECTION A STORY BY STELLA BENSON I N THE corner of the dingy little saloon of the ship China Rose , Mrs. Burns sat eating her dinner with some difficulty  --  for the sea was rough . There were two or three other passengers in the China Rose , a small coastal ship , but all , it seemed , were seasick except Mrs. Burns . The Captain and two of his officers sat at another table and , after congratulating Mrs. Burns in jocular voices on her valiant immunity , talked among themselves only . The Captain seemed rather harassed . The day had been so dark and the sea so high that he had not been able to find out exactly where he was and , since the coast was notoriously dangerous in that region , had been obliged to anchor as best he might when night fell . The ship  --  due in port that morning early  --  would , therefore , be at least twenty-four hours late , even if the next day 's weather should be better . Mrs. Burns was half way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young woman whom Mrs. Burns had not hitherto seen . The newcomer was very pale , her hair was untidy , and she had rouged her cheeks very carelessly ; but these flaws could not disguise her remarkable good looks . She strode to Mrs. Burns 's table and sat down , saying loudly , " I feel wretchedly ill , but I must put in an appearance , I suppose , to show that I 'm not seasick . " " My husband is not seasick either , " said Mrs. Burns loyally . " He ate some of that cucumber salad at tiffin , " she added in a low secret voice , looking nervously at the Captain , in case his pride might be involved in the integrity of his ship 's cucumbers . " I 'm so glad , " said the newcomer . Mrs. Burns , though subscribing , for her husband 's sake , to the odd theory that it is somehow more noble to suffer from cucumbers than from seasickness , was a little surprised that this stranger should be actually glad of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , " thought Mrs. Burns . " Especially such good-looking girls . " The stranger repeated , " I am glad . Steward , take this cucumber salad away . It 's a public danger . I 'm glad but not surprised . " " What at ? " Mrs. Burns could not resist asking . " At being warned in time . It 's al-ways the way . I live an absolutely protected life . " Mrs. Burns was an ideal receptacle for the stories of other people 's lives . She looked very gentle ; she never had any story of her own to tell ; she nearly always made the correct flattering comments on the stories she was told , and was correctly flabbergasted at the correct moments . And so , between the stranger ( Miss Wanda Galloway ) , a born talker , and Mrs. Burns , a born listener , talk , about Miss Galloway herself of course , was almost inevitable . She spoke in a very clear , confident voice and , as she was a very handsome young woman indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prepared to listen , unabashed , from the other table . As the girl was so handsome they naturally hoped to hear that gentle stream of fascinating inanity that beautiful lips as a rule emit , but disillusionment dawned as her self-confident incisive voice cleaved the air . " I 've always been like that ; it 's quite disconcerting , " she said . " My guardian angel 's really too officious . It 's really embarrassing how everything is always so elaborately arranged for the best for me . Look at this delay in our arrival at Tungli-fu . It 's all on my account . I get these wretched attacks of bronchial asthma  --  they only last twenty-four hours or so  --  and what does my guardian angel do but arrange to delay the ship twenty-four hours , so that I can stay in bed all day and keep warm and get well , instead of arriving at Tungli-fu this morning and splashing to shore in a sampan two miles over a rough sea . I tell you , it 's typical . I 'm always looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfishly of his sailing schedule and the interests of his owners at the mercy of a passenger 's officious guardian angel , rattled his coffee-cup a little irritably . " You are joking , surely , " said Mrs. Burns gently . " You ca n't really believe that a heavenly being would watch so carefully over one person at the expense of others . " " I must believe it , " said Miss Galloway intensely . " My experience obliges me to believe it . Guardian angels are fallible , like everyone else , I suppose , and mine is certainly overzealous . I 'm not saying I approve of it  --  on the contrary , I often feel really uncomfortable about it  --  but there it is . I remember first noticing it when mydear father died . He was very much opposed to my leaving home to study painting , and we had one dreadful final scene , in the course of which he threatened  --  poor darling  --  to cut me off with a shilling if I insisted on having my own way He died of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was frightfully cut up , of course , but ? I was able to study painting . The money Dad Ieft me , though it was n't wealth , was enough to keep me very comfortably during my training . " After a reminiscent pause she added , " You will be wondering whether I became a good enough painter to justify my guardian angel in such a drastic removal of darling Daddy . " The shocked Mrs. Burns had not been wondering anything of the kind . " Art " was a kind of indoor game , in her view , and could not be looked upon as a justification of anything , in any circumstances , any more than could ping-pong . " The answer is No , " continued Miss Galloway relentlessly . " I was a very bad painter indeed . My guardian angel , I suppose , realized this , for somehow , through a series of accidents , so to speak , I got the reputation of being a very subtle painter without ever having my pictures seen by any one who really knew how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw they are in a majority in European painting circles I got the name of being so mysteriously significant that presently Wilson Forrest who of course did know how to draw asked if he might come to my studio . You know about Wilson Forrest , of course . . . Well , he was quite sure in advance that he had discovered a new marvel in me . My guardian angel pays the most extraordinary attention to detail in these matters ; he had omitted nothing that could whet Wilson 's keenness  --  without ever letting him come across a completed ex-ample of my work . My beginnings are always very impressive . On the day Wilson was coming , I was getting tea ready for him and went out for the cakes . . . . I suppose the spirit lamp under the tea-kettle must have exploded  --  anyway , the studio caught fire ; the house , in fact , was burned down . Not one of my canvases was saved . " " How very shocking ! " exclaimed Mrs. Burns . " Was anyone injured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the way , the landlady 's little girl was badly hurt . Well , Wilson arrived when the fire was at its height and he was so deeply impressed by the way I faced the complete loss of ten years work that he proposed marriage to me on the spot . I never painted another stroke but , owing to Wilson 's faith in me , this somehow enhanced my esoteric and subtle reputation  --  and , till the day of his death , he always spoke of me as a first-rate painter . " " The day of his death ! " echoed Mrs. Burns aghast . " You are not going to tell me that your guardian angel took a dislike to ? " " Oh , not before my reputation was well established , of course . It was wartime , you know . Wilson was one of the first to join up , poor dear . As a matter of fact , he was n't killed till two years later . Twice , indeed , we arranged to be actually married , but my guardian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time ; the Battle of the Somme had begun and ? " " Surely you ca n't realize what you are saying ! " gasped Mrs. Burns . " That the Battle of the Somme , in which the flower of England fell , was arranged in order that you ? " " I 'm not making any comment on the facts , " said Miss Galloway . " I 'm not saying any of this was justifiable . On the contrary , I 've admitted freely that my guardian angel carries things very much too far . I 'm simply telling you what happened . The second time Wilson 's leave was due  --  we had again arranged our wedding  --  but , that time , I broke my leg ? " " You broke your leg ! " breathed Mrs. Burns on a refreshed note . Something like a sigh of relief went round the saloon  --  a sigh so audible that Miss Galloway realized then that the Captain and officers were listening to her story  --  whether or not she noticed that all were pink with repressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . She need fear no foe , being so assiduously protected . " It was all arranged by that busy angel of mine of course . It was in hospital that I met John  --  he was the house-surgeon . We became engaged almost at once . I must say , my guardian angel has done him proud ( as the saying goes ) ever since . Stroke after stroke of wonderful good luck has come his way ; I wish there were time to describe to you some of the proofs of elaborate pre-arrangement that came to light in connection with dear John 's career . . .. He never could be spared , for one reason or another , to go to the War , and since the War he has had some marvellous jobs . Not only that , but all his cousins and things were killed and he inherited a great deal of money . His last job is just the kind of thing he loves , for he 's an enthusiastic traveler . He 's in charge of a group of big mission hospitals  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my way now to be married to him at M. where he has a most comfortable house in the hospital compound . Everything sounds delightful . Quite a comfortable train journey , I believe , from Tungli-fu , and now that the weather has delayed the ship long enough to let me get over my chill  --  well , you can see , ca n't you , that my guardian angel 's obviously still on the job ? " " But what about poor Mr. Thingumbob ? " asked Mrs. Burns most mournfully . " Was n't he very much upset ? " " Oh , Wilson ? Yes , poor old Wilson turned rather nasty  --  said I 'd treated him badly  --  but he was killed quite soon , poor old thing . " And in her expressionless tone , which conveyed " So that was that , " Mrs. Burns was horrified to recognize that impulse that sometimes occurs , like a chip of flint in the normal mind ? and from the normal mind is instantly extracted  --  that flash of feeling , " I injured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own thoughts ; I ca n't bear that he should be alive . " This feeling , an impulse of vengeance on the part of vanity , refers always to those we have injured rather than to those who have injured us . It is very much more unbearable to the vanity to hurt than to be hurt . The gentle Mrs. Burns , therefore , half-recognizing something that appalled her in Miss Galloway 's reference to her first lover 's death , said , " I am sorry but I really must go to my cabin now ; I 'm feeling . . seasick . " Seasickness is admittedly a shameful thing to admit ; but there are deeper shames . Mr. Burns , faintly bleating from his bunk for news of the outer world , was unable to understand what it was that had distressed his wife so much . " Guardian angels ? " he murmured , closing his eyes convulsively as the window-curtain swung out above him to an angle of thirty-five degrees . " A very pretty notion , I should have thought , my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " The Captain evidently discovered where he was by the more hopeful light of dawn , for the ship China Rose was entering Tungli-fu harbor as Mrs. Burns awoke . She was glad of this for , though the Burns 's destination wasnot Tungli-fu , arrival at this harbor spelled " Last Tap , thank goodness , " to them . Mrs. Burns was enjoying this trip even less than she usually enjoyed China coast trips ; last night had left a bad taste in her mouth . As she lay musing in her bunk , she heard a widespread shouting outside and then a terrifying slow crash . The ship gave a great lurch and recoiled , and then there was a second 's silence before the shouting began again . " A collision , " cried Mr. Burns . They were both on deck before they had time to think again . The deck of the China Rose was strewn with wreckage , and yet it seemed obvious , even to a landlubber 's eye , that the other ship involved was the more seriously damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to speak to passengers . " It 's a judgment on old Ericsen , " he cried . " Look at his bows , I ask you . The Rose is well out of it . Did you see the way he came straight at us ? Must have been drunk . Every one knows old Ericsen and avoids him like the plague . In the ordinary way we miss him here  --  it was just that twenty-four hours ' delay .. . " " You 'll find there was a reason for it , " said Miss Galloway who came up at that moment . The second officer disappeared uncomfortably . Mr. Burns , who , unshaven and in his crumpled kimono , looked no more smart than might be expected , after his thirty-six hours ' ordeal , hurried away with a muffled apology . Mrs. Burns was too kind to escape so precipitately , and the silence that followed ( for Miss Galloway did not seem in the least curious about the accident ) was broken only by a new voice . " Darling Wanda , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my way out in the launch . I expected to see you go to the bottom before my eyes . Oh , darling , how frightful ! And I 'd been thinking we were so lucky , for I thought I might miss you . Our plans are all changed . I 've been blessing the storm that delayed you . Miss Galloway threw herself into the arms of the speaker , a large pink young man whom one could see at a glance to be an excellent creature , Mrs. Burns looked at him for a moment with a mourning eye , as at one doomed , and then , recollecting herself , and , still more , recollecting her kimono and pigtails , hurried to her cabin , additionally sped by the sound of more strangers approaching . As she dressed she heard the chorus on deck increased to a community outcry , above which the piercing , cheerful voice of Miss Galloway 's beloved could be heard crying , " Darling ! Is n't it too extraordinary ! " So many newcomers , attracted by the accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arriving in the saloon for breakfast , found scarcely a seat free and were enabled to sit down only by the offer of Miss Galloway and her young doctor ? " If we sit small , this seat 'll hold us all . " " Is n't it too extraordinary ! " shrilled the ingenuous young man as soon as he had been introduced . " It 's so like darling Wanda  --  she 's literally collided with a parson  --  just at the right moment .. yes , there was a parson on board the other ship ; and as both ships are going to be delayed , he can marry us . Is n't it extraordinary ? ? parsons are such very rare birds at Tungli-fu . You see , our plans had been changed ; I 'm being sent down the coast ( I was booked on that ship that you collided with ) to help to deal with an outbreak of plague , and ? " " Oh , do n't go where there 's plague , " cried Mrs. Burns , to her own surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . Anyway , the only flyin the ointment was a frightfully big fly : 1 had had to wire to Wanda to postpone our wedding and tell her to go up to Hongkong and wait for me there . But now , not only is this ship twenty-four hours behind her time , so that I could meet her myself ; not only has Wanda nailed down a parson by colliding with him , but both ships are now delayed for repair , so that we can be married and have three or four days together before I have to send her to Hongkong ? " " Three or four days of delay ! " echoed Mr. Burns , horrified , thinking of the mission conference in Hongkong to which he was bound . " Yes , is n't it extraordinary ! It might have been arranged . " " It was , " said Miss Galloway . Her lover laughed . " She 's got a bee in her bonnet , this girl has ! Is n't she a darling ! " he said to Mrs. Burns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very rash , really I do  --  if you 'll forgive my saying so . " She tried to put into words the reason for her feeling . " Getting married . . . and then parting at once . . . and then sending her in this ship to Hongkong .. . and then going , yourself , into such danger . . . " " Oh , there 's no danger from plague ! " cried the young man blithely . " And even if the worst came to the worst , it 's much easier to fix things up safely , you know , for one 's widow than ? " " Oh , do n't  --  do n't , " cried Mrs. Burns . Mr. Burns was still intent upon his own misfortune . " Three or four days , " he murmured tragically , and the moment breakfast was over , he hurried to buttonhole the Captain . Mrs. Burns waited for him on deck . The two damaged ships lay close together , a swarm of boats and launches round them . What few other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her true love and her miraculously discovered clergyman . " You must come to the wedding , Mrs. Burns-111 let you know , " she called up from the launch . Mrs. Burns smiled and waved , but she could have cried as she looked down on the innocent bald spot on the fluffy crown of the intended husband . It seemed to her that Miss Galloway 's guardian angel sat beside him , eyeing him ominously , fidgeting with a flaming sword . Mr. Burns at last appeared with the Captain . " Shall I go to their wedding or not ? " said Mrs. Burns restlessly . " You ca n't , " said Mr. Burns . " We 're off . The Captain says the damage is n't so serious as he at first thought  --  and it 'll be better repaired in Hongkong . We 're off at once . " " But  --  oh , Captain  --  Miss Galloway . . . she 's supposed to be coming to Hongkong . . . she went ashore . . ought n't we to send word ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've made my arrangements they must take the consequences , " said the Captain with a slightly guilty look . " But her luggage , her trousseau ? " implored the tender-hearted lady . " It 's gone ashore in the agents ' launch . " " Captain ! I believe you deliber-ately ? " " If passengers leave the ship ? " began the Captain again , and then candor rushed back into his face . " I 'm damned if I 'll have any more guardian angels in my shipt " he said , and walked away gaily , sniffing pleased sniffs about the deck , as though it had been successfully disinfected . Every one in those seas remembers the fate of the China Rose . She must have been more seriously damaged by the collision than she seemed , for she developed a list not long after leaving Tungli-fu , and quite slowly and quietly capsized . The passengers , officers , and crew all had ample time to find safety in the boats . " It 's that devil of a girl , " was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most unhappy silence , as he sat in the lifeboat beside Mrs. Burns . " I do n't quite see why , sir , " said the second officer . " Though I agree that she was a devil of a girl . " " I figured it out wrong , of course , " said the Captain . " She seemed to be so dangerously well protected that I thought it was our only hope to leave her behind . But now , of course , it 's obvious that that damned angel of hers arranged for her to be left behind . " " But she would have been all right with us , sir , " persisted the second officer . " Here we are , all safe and sound  --  and Lord knows we 've got no guardian angels fussing about . . . " " She would have lost her trousseau , " said the Captain gloomily . " Oh , you should n't talk in this way , even in jest , " said Mrs. Burns gently . She looked uneasily at the melancholy bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did so , she had a sudden impulse to pray for the young man who was by now the husband of the beautiful Miss Galloway.
