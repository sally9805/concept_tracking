" We have proceeded upon the theory that we should not be afraid to tackle hot pokers because they were hot . " So saying , Paul Bellamy , editor of the Cleveland Plain Dealer , opened last week the 12th annual meeting of the American Society of Newspaper Editors in the auditorium of Washington 's National Press Club . <P> In normal years an overture such as President Bellamy 's would be pure rhetoric . Editors ' conventions generally deal with questions no hotter than how to cope with pressagentry , how to invigorate an editorial page . But last week within easy reach of A.S.N.E. were two pokers that were hot indeed . The first was <P> General Johnson who made a speech , blunt , picturesque , reproachful , conciliatory . Excerpts : " We have been accused of a diabolical desire to impose a censorship on the Press . Considering the articles in opposition to the president 's program , we certainly have made the poorest kind of mess , if control of the agencies of publicity was one of our objects . ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson barked : " Now , let 's turn this into a press conference , let our hair down and talk-shoot every question you want . " <P> Most of the hundred-odd editors assembled ( biggest attendance in four years ) did not know quite what to do next . Most of them had never been in Washington professionally . Regular correspondents on the sidelines watched with unholy delight while their bosses showed their clumsiness at crossexamination . But among the editors was one old hand at picking up hot pokers held out by government officials . He was Arthur Joseph Sinnott , managing editor of the rich and prosperous Newark Evening News , biggest and best daily in New Jersey . <P> Managing Editor Sinnott , smart and Scotch , went to work for the News 29 years ago when he was 19 . In 1912 he was sent to Washington where he remained until 1925 , when the Scudders recalled him to Newark to take complete charge of their newspaper in fact if not in name . He was a crack Washington correspondent , would have made a crack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no windy nonsense from any Senator . From his desk in the Colorado Building he could gather news direct by telephone from practically every Government official in town except the President . <P> Back in Washington as an editor , Newshawk Sinnott did not hesitate last week to tell General Johnson : " I was just a bit shocked to get the impression that you feel the Press has not given you a square deal . " <P> General Johnson : I did not mean to give that impression . I think I have been treated pretty gently all things considered . <P> Editor Sinnott : Our main kick is that you are shooting too fast , it makes us all dizzy . You are trying to get heaven on earth-a code for this and a code for that . . . . But I did n't know the newspaper trade was exactly a sweat shop . <P> General Johnson : Who said it was ? <P> Editor Sinnott : I think it was from the White House . <P> General Johnson : ... I will take full responsibility for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am sorry for it . It was maladroitness of expression .
