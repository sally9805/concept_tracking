Canada 's ten many-branched banks have no Federal Reserve overlordship , no small bank competition , but the law under which they operate must be overhauled every ten years . When the question of a new Bank Act came up in Parliament as usual last spring , the danger of the banks ' situation was suddenly plain . From the Western prairies rose furious anti-banker howls for a new system , for lower interest rates , for " nationalization of credit . " Parliament was impressed . To avoid financial confusion when Canada could least afford it , Conservative Premier Bennett got the Parliament to extend bank charters for one year during which he promised to call a commission to study Canada 's banking , currency and coinage . <P> He invited to its headship a famed Scottish lawyer , son of a Scottish parson , Hugh Pattison Macmillan , Baron Macmillan of Aberfeldy , co-author of the brilliant " Macmillan Report " of the British Treasury Committee on Finance &; Industry . So sound and lucid was it that it became the only Blue Book ever published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commission was another son of a Scottish parson , Sir Charles Addis , onetime director of the Bank of England . These two Scotsmen Premier Bennett balanced with two Canadian bankers , Sir William Thomas White and Beaudry Leman . To give Western Canada a voice he threw in Premier John Edward Brownlee of the Province of Alberta . For two months the Commissioners have inched over the wide Canadian landscape from bank to bank ( TIME , Aug. 28 ) . Last week , after the two Scotsmen had gotten back to London for congratulation dinners , the Commission 's findings were issued at Ottawa . <P> Big news was that a majority of the Commission recommended a Central Bank for Canada , modeled on the Bank of England . In the majority were the two Scotsmen and the Western Canadian Premier . The Commission 's minority-the two Canadian bankers-dissented on the grounds that a central bank would soon get messed in Canadian politics . Conscientious Lord Macmillan with his old laurels to protect warned : <P> " A Central Bank could not cure all the economic ills of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit for all borrowers on all occasions : indeed , its operations might as often be restrictive as expansive . " <P> Speaking at a dinner of the Canada Club in London last fortnight , he anticipated the possibility that the Bank might be a disappointment until Canadian bankers were converted to its principle . Puffed he : " When you reflect that not a single depositor has lost a cent in this troublesome period and that the banks are firm and solvent , you will agree that the bankers of Canada may well take credit to themselves . . . . I am not at all sure that Canada may not , before many years are over , become the economic centre of the British Empire . " <P> To the Commission 's second recommendation all five members set their hand . It called for an organization to extend intermediate and short-term credit to Canada 's furious farmers . Observers last week expected Parliament , when it meets next January , to make the Commission 's recommendations Canadian law .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
