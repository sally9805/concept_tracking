A sight fair to an old Rowing Blue is the thronged four-mile S of the Thames between Putney Bridge and Mortlake Brewery on the day of an Oxford-Cambridge boat race . Last week 's race , the 91st since 1829 , was more exciting than ever , due to the possibility that Irish dynamiters might also attend . Guards were quadrupled on all the bridges ; spectators were barred from the popular halfway vantage point , Hammersmith Bridge , which the Irish recently bombed . River police patrolled all morning . <P> The odds were 2-1 on Oxford to repeat its successes of the last two years . Tickled were most Britishers at the thought of four-foot-two. 71-lb . Coxswain Hart Massey , son of the Canadian High Commissioner , nephew of Actor Raymond Massey , urging eight Oxonian giants to great efforts with an electric-bell system instead of the traditional megaphone . <P> But at the gun Cambridge got off to a great racing start , got a quarter-length lead in the first 200 yards ; at Craven Steps , about the three-quarter-mile mark , Cambridge had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mile Post there was a half-length of open water , the Light Blue stroke had settled down to a steady 30 , and Oxford was vainly trying to spurt . At Hammersmith Bridge , with nobody but the guards overhead to watch , Cambridge had a commanding two lengths . A bomb might have stopped them , but Oxford could not . Cambridge sailed by Mortlake sitting up ; Oxford slumped in , all down but Coxs'n Massey , four lengths behind . The score , over 110 years : Cambridge 48 ; Oxford 42 ; one dead heat ( 1877 ) .
