txt Earl Karner , 34 years old , 500 North Ninth avenue , Maywood , suffers from lumbago . The lumbago has been jolted around a lot and made more uncomfortable by a tractor which Earl drives part time for the Illinois Emergency Relief commission . When a friend suggested to him that a cup of tea , fortified with whisky , was a sovereign remedy for the ' lumbago , Earl decided to give ' it a trial . Also he reasoned that if one dose would do good , two would do better , and three would , or should , be magnificent . So he took three . And then , to see if the results really were good , Earl took out the tractor and went for a drive . He was clanking down Jackson boulevard at 20 miles ' an hour . when Policeman Ralph Riley halted him . - Yesterday Municipal Judge Gibson E. Gorman of the safety court fined Earl $100 and sentenced him to 20 days in the Bridewell for reckless driving .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
