ARMY &; NAVY <P> With the gay little " Admirals ' March " nine Cabinet members one after another were piped over the side of the cruiser Indianapolis docked at a Manhattan pier early one morning last week . Then everybody fidgeted , waiting for President Roosevelt . Finally after 15 minutes he drove up in a touring car whose narrow tonneau he , his full-sized wife and New York 's roly-poly mayor LaGuardia more than filled . The ship 's band played " The Star Spangled Banner " and the President rode down the Hudson through the narrows and out of New York Harbor for his first review of the U. S. Fleet . <P> Had President Roosevelt been two hours late he would not have delayed the ceremonies . Off Staten Island fog closed in . The Indianapolis dropped anchor , whistled for a wind to blow the dank pall away . Ultimately the whistling had its effect . After noon the four-starred cruiser reached the reviewing grounds two mi. south of Ambrose Lightship , followed by the Louis-mile bearing lesser lights of the Government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flagship of the Fleet , with the clean , high silhouets of airplane carriers Saratoga and Lexington behind . <P> Silently , swiftly , the meticulously spaced parade of men-o ' - war bore by . The sounds that came across the steel-grey waters to the President 's ear were few and sharp : brass bands playing one chorus of the national anthem , the six-pounders saluting 21 times , like doors banging in a distant , empty house . A thousand yards astern of the carriers footed seven Treaty cruisers of the Scouting Force , then a brood of 21 destroyers . Two thousand yards behind them glided the cruisers and destroyers of the Battle Force , followed by nine of the nation 's 15 capital ships . New Mexico and Mississippi looked the most impressive with their modern , heavy forward fighting bridges . But the West Virginia , with outmoded masts like inverted wire-work waste baskets , sported a white E on her stack to show that she still surpassed all upstarts in her division in engineering efficiency . The show was over when the train , the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Navy 's first carrier , closing the rear file with superannuated sauciness . <P> Honor of leading the Fleet into New York Harbor and to its Hudson River anchorage fell to the President , whose ship was now saluted by roaring power dives from 15 crack planes of the Fleet . But all naval eyes were still on the Indianapolis ' fore truck . By tradition one more thing was necessary to complete the ceremony . Three little flags broke out spelling Y W X , Yoke William Xray , the Navy 's " Well Done " signal . That meant the President was pleased .
