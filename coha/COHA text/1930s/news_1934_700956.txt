txt The National Recovery Act has , , failed markedly to attain its objective , according to an analysis made by economists of the Brookings Institution of Washington . They told a meeting of the American Economic Association here today that the NRA , regarded as one of the important elements of recovery a year ago , now presented a problem as " it is now seriously questioned in important ways by every agency concerned . " The most outspoken critic of the NRA was George Terborgh , former adviser to the Federal Reserve Board , who went so far as to say that not only would " the NRA have retarded recovery if it had worked out as planned , out that it retarded recovery as it actually did not work . " It was Leverett S. Lyon , chief of ' the Brookings Institution staff directing the NRA research , who called the recovery administration " a problem , " while Dr. Lewis Lorwin , addressing himself to the labor aspect maintained that the NRA represented " a bundle of missed opportunities , half-way compromises and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , associated with the NRA study made by the Brookings Institution , discussing the administrative aspects , said that the NRA was still " partially paralyzed by conflicting opinions on policy . " It was also In the dilemma of having policie3 contrary to the provisions of the codes , he declared , adding that no proper administrative personnel was available for such duties as the NRA created . Counsel Defends NRA Acts . Blackwell Smith , acting NRA counsel , in discussing the reports made by the Brookings Institution 's staff , vigorously defended the NRA and declared that it had helped raise wages and eliminate child labor , and that recovery was well under way as a direct result of NRA operations . While these addresses were being made before the American Economic Association at the Palmer House , a dozen other economic and sociological associations were meeting in the same hotel and in several other downtown hostelries , considering other phases of modern American life , together with problems of relief , taxation , agriture and finance . At tonight 's general session of the American Economic Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Political Science Association and the American Sociological Society , Calvin Hoover , professor of economics at Duke University , in a detailed comparison of the Italian Fascist , German National Socialist and Russian Bol- shevist systems with the New Deal 's aspirations , maintained that in the future the government of this country was likely to continue to intervene in economic matters " whenever it seems necessary . " Mr. Hoover said that , in addition , the nation might expect " our government to control , regulate or take over those economic functions which it becomes obvious can not be left to manage themselves . " Comparison With Fascism . " In this respect the economic policy and program of the New Deal somewhat resembles fascism and national socialism , " he continued . " The obvious difference between the path of economic reform which we are treading in the United States and the paths of Italy , Germany and Russia is that although , like these countries , we are being forced by the inevitable pressure of events away from the system of laissezfaire , we are nevertheless trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William F. Ogburn , sociologist of the University of Chicago , who was on the same program , concurred with Professor Hoover 's view that indications were pointing to a union of industry and government " somewhat as the family and industry were united for centuries in the agriculturalhousehold economy . " Contemplation of such a closer union brought fear that the inefficiences of a colectivistic state or a vastly regulatory one " will mean a lower standard of living , " Professor Ogburn pointed out . He cautioned , however , that it should not be taken for granted that efficiency would be less under a union of industry and State , as it was quite possible that efficiency might be increased because of the possibility of planning relationships outside a particular plant or industry . " Super-Organization " Needed . As Professor Ogburn studied the different problems posed by the present economic and social trends he came to the opinion that " it seems more and more clear that some kind of super-organization is needed to work out a solution , " but if such an organization turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to have much the same power that a political government has to effect solutions and its authority might be just as irksome to the subsidiary units . " After describing the potentialities for social good that might arise from the furtherance of invention , Professor Ogburn said there were difficulties inherent in our present civilization because its interrelated parts were changing at unequal rates of speed , bringing maladjustments and social problems . The future of many of the present unemployed was classed as highly uncertain by speakers at a joint meeting of the American Statistical Association and a section of the American Sociological Association , where the discussion was ccTncerned with social statistics in the research program of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration . This program was in charge of FERA officials , who said that , with one-seventh of the population of the United States receiving relief , studies made by the FERA research section had already revealed that there existed large blocks of this relief population " which can not be regarded as emergency problems . " " Indeed it appears that many of these people will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordinator of urban research . " One-fifth of the present cases now on relief contain no employable person , " he continued . " About 12 per cent of the 3,000,000 urban cases have had no non-relief employment for four years . Many thousands of rural families have been ' discovc:311 ' on land which will probably never support them at acceptable living standards , if indeed it ever did so . the age of 65 years . The number of aged is expected to double in the years to come with consequently larger numbers becoming dependent . " Similarly , as the months go on , it is apparent that not even all the employables will leave the relief rolls at once , if indeed they leave them at all , for the skills of many are becoming outmoded and a quarter of them are 45 years or more of age and will be replaced by younger workers . " The speaker stressed the need of help being accorded the relief administration in solving the relief problems , because of the fact that the character of relief was shifting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard B. Myers , assistant director of the FERA division of research , said that the large number of cases of women with dependent children on relief and of aged persons in families with no bread-winner showed the need for a comprehensive system of mothers ' pensions , old-age pensions and invalidity and accident insurance . Dwight Sanders , coordinator of rural research for the FERA , announced that research figures disclosed that one-fifth of all the households receiving relief were adjudged incapable of permanent selfsupport , largely due to the number of those above 65 years of age . Terborgh Hits Price Policies . In speaking of the NRA and recovery , Mr. Terborgh asserted that in giving industry the right to control prices the NRA permitted a policy that ran counter to its efforts to increase purchasing power by an advance in wages . Most of the excessive price competition of which industry complained would have disappeared naturally with the revival of business , he argued . Finally , he said , the price control devices which were used " were for the most part either non-administrable or objectionable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion this method of attack on the depression was a mistake , " he added . Mr. Terborgh attacked the socalled " purchasing power " theory by saying that the NRA did not deal with the problem of helping the durable-goods industries , but asked three industries which were hardest hit by the depression to raise wages without concurrently raising prices by enough to finance the added labor costs . " My own view is that the boosting of costs and prices that went on under the NRA was premature , ill-advised and inimical to the expansion of productive activity , " said Mr. Terborgh . " Both employers and employes , generally speaking , needed a greater volume of activity , not a higher price per unit of product ar service . " Restriction on hours by NRA codes , according to Mr. Terborgh , initially added about 1,750,000 employes to the nation 's payrolls and since then there had been practically no further gain . Analyzes the NRA " Effect . " In conclusion , he said that the effect of the NRA was to increase hourly earnings by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much ; that average hours per week were reduced about 6 per cent , average weekly dollar earnings were increased by 4 per cent and average weekly real earnings were increased by 5 or 6 per cent and employment was increased 6 to 7 per cent . " The great bulk of the real income accruing to the workers added through the work-spreading program came from a diminution of the real income of the workers previously employed , " he asserted . In discussing the labor aspects of the New Deal , Dr. Lorwin said : " The NRA represents the emergence of an indirect method for enacting Federal labor legislation by industries on a nation-wide basis . " The independent labor boards are the nucleus of a new Federal machinery for introducing a system of collective bargaining into American industry . " The NRA so far has proved to be a rather inadequate device for Federal labor legislation . Excepting wage minima and hours , the codes by and large have reflected the status quo ante . " The independent labor boards have done their best to make Section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collective bargaining . They have had to contend with employer resistance . The NRA 's compliance division and the Department of Justice have been slow in coming to their aid . The influence of the boards on the structure of industrial relations has thus been small , " The development of ' industrial self-government ' has been lopsided , except where trade unions were strong enough to get adequate representation on Code Authorities . " Perceptible shifts in the balance of capital-labor bargaining power have taken place in favor of labor in the needle trades , in coal mining , in the building trades and in a few other industries . Elsewhere , the gains to organized labor have been largely offset by the growth of company unions . " A Great Social Principle . " " But the NRA still represents in principle a great social advance in so far as it recognizes the obligation of society to secure a living wage for its workers and in so far as it invests the goveripnent with the function of planning a stable prosperity for the nation as a whole . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it had been accompanied by an increase of 35 per cent in payrolls since April , 1933 . Asserting that it was estimated that as a result of the NRA there had been a 25 per cent increase in wages above the cost of living for all employes affected under the codes , he argued that critics of the NRA mostly looked backward . Taking issue with Mr. Terborgh , Mr. Smith maintained that increased labor costs had spurred industries to become more efficient . In effect , he referred to the added wage costs under NRA as " a gigantic capital levy . " Dr. Max J. Wasserman , senior agricultural economist of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration and assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Illinois , also defended the NRA . He said : " Among the obstacles in the way of recovery which had to be cleared away before recovery could he launched were the long hours and low pay , or sweatshop labor conditions , the unfair competitive practices , the cutting of prices below profitable levels , the production of shoddy products and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a vast improvement in these conditions . " It was impossible to open the channels of trade as long as busi- I ness men were unable to sell at profitable prices . The increase in prices . which the codes stimulated made a vast improvement here , so that it is now possible for American industry to increase productionl without fear of bankruptcy . " Asserting that the growth of national power , as represented in the Federal Government , had heel . on the increase since the beginning of the government itself , and had swept forward with especial force in the last three-quarters of a century , Professor Charles E. Merriam of the University of Chicago asserted in an address at tonight 's general session that he did not find " in the development of executive authority anything more than the usual expansion of Presidential power in times of tension .
