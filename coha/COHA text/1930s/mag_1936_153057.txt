A one-pound ball of the fibre , if straightened out , would stretch from coast to coast of the U. S. A woman 's undergarment made of it could be concealed in the palm of the hand . It is 150% finer than any previous rayon , 33% finer than natural silk . It was developed almost simultaneously by three manufacturers and no one has an exclusive claim to it . <P> Such were the facts about a new synthetic fibre , recited last week in Kansas City , by Dr. Ernest Baden Benger of du Pont de Nemours &; Co . Nearly 2,000 chemists , some of them from England , Switzerland and Holland , were assembled there for the 91st convention of the American Chemical Society . <P> Rubber , silk , cellulose and certain other organic compounds contain " giant molecules " weighing hundreds of thousands and even millions of times as much as the hydrogen atom . The rayon industry ( which last year produced more than 256,000,000 lb. of fabrics , employed 60,000 workers and paid them $60,000,000 ) is currently profiting by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been found that cellulose molecules in cotton are chains of 3,500 links . Such long molecules could be seen under the microscope if they were fat enough . The new artificial fibre is built on the same plan but limited to 450 links . Dr. Benger declared it would make cooler and cheaper summer clothes . <P> Other noteworthy discussions of the meeting : <P> Flame &; Pressure . General Motors Corp . has developed an ingenious camera arrangement which takes 5,000 pictures per second of the fuel explosion in an automobile motor combustion chamber . When a car is bowling along at 40 m. p. h. , its motor turns over about 2,000 times a minute , and one complete explosion lasts only 1/250th of a second . Of this brief performance the camera records 20 successive stages . The film runs continuously at crankshaft speed-up to 250 m. p. h . Light from the explosion passes through a heavy quartz window in the cylinder head to a stationary lens , thence to a series of 30 rapidly moving lenses which follow the film and hold each image motionless on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lone star in a black sky , then a flame front spreading and backwashing around the base of the chamber . At one stage back pressure was observed to make combustion-produced carbon dioxide hotter than the actually burning gases . Pressure-curve recorders enable motormen to cor relate pressure with flame front propagation , a long-sought goal. - Dr. Gerald Mark Rassweiler and Lloyd Withrow of GM 's Detroit laboratories . <P> Molecule Magnets . It has been known for years that nerve impulses are electric in nature . But the mode of transmission remained obscure . It was wrong to picture a current passing along a nerve fibre as if through a metallic conductor . Since 1926 Dr. Edwin Joseph Colin and his associates at Harvard have been looking for a better picture . Last week he announced important progress .
