He is the first monk to sit in the House of Lords since the reign of Queen Elizabeth ( 1558-1603 ) . Habitually this Lord Bishop of Truro dresses shabbily , in an old black cassock , a leathern girdle . He is pale , thin , ascetic . Brother Churchmen consider him a saintly man , unquestionably the greatest liturgiologist in the Anglican Communion . <P> Strict monasticism is a comparatively new thing in the Church of England , and a newer one in its U. S. offshoot , the Protestant Episcopal Church . Bishop Frere belongs to the Community of the Resurrection ( founded 1892 ) . Bishop Frere joined the order at its founding , was its superior 1902-13 , 1916-22 . He has been Bishop of Truro since 1923 .
