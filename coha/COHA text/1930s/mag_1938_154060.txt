National defense , the subject foremost in President Roosevelt 's mind since the elections , was pushed aside by him for a few minutes last week while he enunciated with icy deliberation the nation 's considered opinion of Adolf Hitler &; Co. ' s super-pogrom ( see p. 10 ) . When he returned to national defense , it was with implied reference again to Adolf Hitler &; Co . The possibility of the U. S. being air-raided , he said , had increased tremendously in five years . When asked if he had any particular air-raiders in mind , he told his questioner to reread the international news of those same years . <P> Out of his broader discussion of the reasons for national rearmament came a new high-policy phrase : " Continental solidarity . " The President confirmed the intimation previously voiced by Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles ( TIME , Nov. 14 ) : that one object of U. S. rearmament is to implement the good-neighborly understanding achieved in 1936 at the Pan-American Conference in Buenos Aires and about to be refreshed at Lima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Buenos Aires , Franklin Roosevelt said that employment given by rearmament work ( which Germany was then rushing , England beginning to rush ) was " false employment , it builds no permanent structure and creates no consumers ' goods for the maintenance of a lasting prosperity . We know that nations guilty of these follies inevitably face the day either when their weapons of destruction must be used against their neighbors or when an unsound economy , like a house of cards , will fall apart . " To get as much virtue as he could out of his new necessity , Mr. Roosevelt last week explored ways of putting Relief money and workers into rearmament work . <P> The ceremonial signing , at long last , in the historic East Room of the White House , of trade treaties with Great Britain and Canada , came to pass last week ( see p. 53 ) . To the Nation 's First Hostess was left the first official announcement of another major international event . At her press conference Mrs. Roosevelt made known that George VI &; Queen Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend three days in June at the White House , one in New York City at the World 's Fair . King George will have the northeast pink bedroom suite which Anna Roosevelt Dall Boettiger used to occupy . Queen Elizabeth will have the larger blue suite on the southeast corner which , before the executive wing was built , used to be the U. S. President 's study . Each suite has one large and one small bedroom , plus a bathroom . Forty ladies &; gentlemen accompanying Their Majesties ( except a few personal attendants ) will be bedded elsewhere about town . <P> To the dinner given him annually by the National Press Club went Franklin Roosevelt last week . Last year at this dinner the President was poisoned by bad capon , but this year the food was as excellent as the wine ( Lanson 1928 ) . In deference to his philately , a lantern-slide performance was staged to show a new series of stamps commemorating high moments                   @ @
