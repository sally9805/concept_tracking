A score of years ago religious people turned to their church weeklies for interpretation of current news , for leadership in opinion . Church weeklies are still abundant ; their aggregate circulation great . But their influence is gone ; a fact of which the Evangelical Churches have become acutely aware in their fight against liquor . As far back as 1928 the Methodist Episcopal General Conference of Kansas City recognized by official resolution the need for a national newspaper of church goers . Again , three months ago , youthful Stanley Hoflund High , Methodist editor of the nondenominational Christian Herald , was quoted : " The time is overripe for the establishment of a Dry newspaper , and lots of people are thinking about it . " Last week the subject again became news when the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church , meeting in Pittsburgh , commended the efforts " of a group of substantial citizens . . . to establish and maintain a national daily newspaper to be published in metropolitan New York , the same to be distinctively Christian in its spirit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it stand squarely for Prohibition , support every cause of political , economic and social righteousness , keep its news columns clean and trustworthy and its advertising space open only to unquestion able products are worthy of hearty recommendation . . . . The General Assembly believes that such a national daily news paper , if adequately financed , ably edited and managed . . . would be of great benefit to the cause of righteousness . " <P> To the last sentence , all-wise Arthur Brisbane added this amendment in his Hearstpaper column : " It would , of course , and it would have to be VERY adequately financed . " <P> Finance is the first obstacle which has been engaging much of the attention and energy of Stanley High for the past year . Some $6,000,000 or $7,000,000 must be within sight before action is taken . But , according to Editor High , the paper must sustain itself on its own merits or it will be abandoned . <P> Therefore it must have an extremely able publisher . Who ? One name appeared last week to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rochester , N. Y. , Unitarian , Dry . Most famed of 17 Dry Gannett dailies ( fourth largest group in the U. S. ) is the Brooklyn Eagle . Probably the new paper would be published in the Eagle 's plant but in no other way would the Eagle be affected . <P> One morning last week Publisher Gannett rose very early to open the doors of the Elmira ( N. Y. ) Star-Gazette himself . It was a gesture of sentiment . Twenty-five years ago he , onetime newsboy , bought a half interest in the old Gazette from the late U. S. Senator David B. Hill , on meagre savings and smart financing . High-minded but not pious , Publisher Gannett built himself a great newspaper fortune not alone by the cleanness and honesty of his papers , of which he is so proud , but also by shrewdness , good sense and uncommon business nerve . <P> He would never undertake the " Christian " daily unless it made sense as a newspaper .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
