txt Education a Means to an End William B. Hebenstreit takes issue with a California educator who was convinced that our educators should stress " current events " as being uniquely educational . In effect , events are merely happenings and are enlightening only as pointing to a something beyond themselves . But what is this beyond ? Here , surely , the issue is not clear as between means and objectives . Mr. Hebenstreit seems to stress that both the means and the objectives of education are one  --  to cause students " to think . " The point carries the greatest importance in an age that accepts metaphysics as pass ? , an age that is using metaphysics as no age has ever before used it ? using it while decrying belief in it , using it without consciousness of using it . In answer to the Californian and to Mr. Hebenstreit , education is meaningless , as work is meaningless , unless we accept it as means to an end . As yet we may not agree upon an end or aim ; education today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In general it is accepted that knowledge will get us somewhere . So pile up knowledge , and let the rood Lord or nature look to the results . EDWARD I. FRNLON . Brooklyn , April 28. 1937.
