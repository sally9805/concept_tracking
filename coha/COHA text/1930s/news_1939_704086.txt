txt A clear warning that Britain would fight for Poland in the event of armed or political aggression against Danzig was delivered yesterday by Prime Minister Chamberlain . He spoke of fears of " surreptitious methods " in the Free City , which he declared was of vital importance to Poland . Page 1 ; text of Mr. Chamberlain 's statement , Page 9 . Warsaw , which naturally was pleasea by the pledge , outlined an offer to Germany , the main point of which was a joint PolishGerman guarantee of Danzig 's independence . Berlin , however , denied any negotiations had begun and found nothing new or startling in the Chamberlain statement . Page 10 . Chamberlain Is Specific By FERDINAND KUHN Jr . Special Cable to THE NEW Yon TIMES . LONDON , July ** Minister Neville Chamberlain made it plain for the first time today that any aggression against Danzig , whether by armed invasion or by internal change , would be covered by the British guarantee to Poland and would he resisted accordingly . In a carefully drafted declaration to the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Poland , the Prime Minister gave precision at last to his momentous pledge of three months ago to help Poland against any threat to her independence . " Recent occurrences in Danzig , " Mr. Chamberlain said , " have inevitably given rise to fears that it is intended to settle her future status by unilateral action , organized by surreptitious methods , thus presenting Poland and other powers with a ' fait accompli . ' " In such circumstances any action taken by Poland to restore the situation would , it is suggested , be represented as an act of aggression on her part and if her action wei e supported by other powers they would he accused of aiding and abetting her in the use of force . " Would Not Be Local Matter If this should happen , Mr. Chamberlain warned , the issue " could not be considered as purely a local matter involving the rights and liberties of Danzigers , which , incidentally , are in no way threatened , but would at once raise graver issues affecting Polish national existence and independence . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our assistance to Poland in case of a clear threat to her independence which she considers it vital to resist with her national forces and we are firmly resolved to cam , out this undertaking . " Mr. Chamberlain did not say Poland would be the sole judge of what might constitute a " clear threat . " But in an earlier passage of his statement he declared Danzig was of " vital strategic and economic importance " to Poland and that " another power established in Danzig could , if it so desired , block Poland 's access to the sea and so exert an economic and military stranglehold upon her . " This was the same thing as saying that the British Government regarded any change in the status of Danzig without Poland 's consent as a " clear threat " and that Poland would be justified in bringing the Anglo-French pledges into operation . ' Changes Made for Poles The statement , as read to the Commons , was almost the same as the draft approved by the Cabinet and sent to Warsaw for approval last week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and Mr. Chamberlain made them cheerfully and without question . It was no wonder that the Poles were overjoyed tonight and that even Mr. Chamberlain 's critics at home were relieved by the statement he had made . It is true that there were no flourishes : n the statement and none of the resonant but empty warnings that British politicians sent toward Germany in the early stages of the Czech crisis a year ago . It may have been too wordy to be effective inside Germany ; its style was sometimes cumbersome d it was read to the Commons in the cold , unemotional manner that Mr. Chamberlain just can not help using on such occasions . Yet if one looked at the complete statement through a magnifying glass it was hard to find a loophole through which the British Government could wriggle to a " second Munich " if it wanted to . The more one read it the more precise it became . The Poles certainly did not regard it as a wriggly statement ; to them it covered all contingencies and did it well . Rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chamberlain suggested that this was not a moment for any negotiations over the status of the Free City . Those who framed the Danzig statute , he said , took into account its German character and its Polish importance and did their best to provide for both . The German population of Danzig , he reminded the House , was not being oppressed and its liberties were not being curtailed . " The present settlement , though it may he capable of improvement , can not in itself be regarded as basically unjust , or illogical , " Mr. Chamberlain said . And he added that Chancellor Adolf Hitler himself had guaranteed the status quo of Danzig until 1944 in the ten-year treaty with Poland that he denounced last Spring . Answering the German cry that the British guarantee had encouraged Poland to resist Germany last March , Mr. Chamberlain recalled that Poland rejected the German claims on March 26 , whereas the guarantee was not given until March 31 . On March 26 , he said , Poland had not even heard of the coming guarantee . " It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed , " Mr. Chamberlain declared , but he quickly went on to say that recent developments in Danzig " have disturbed confidence and rendered it difficult at present to find an atmosphere in which reasonable counsels can prevail . " With a tribute to the Polish Government 's calm attitude , Mr. Chamberlain concluded by expressing the hope that different nationalities in Danzig could work together and that " all concerned will declare and show their determination not to allow any incidents in connection with Danzig to assume such a character as might constitute a menace to the peace of Europe . " Usual Hectoring Is Absent The House was so well satisfied with this statement that there were none of the usual badgering questions when the Prime Minister had finished . Harold Macmillan , one of the rebellious Conservatives , . aid that " the whole House will be grateful to the Prime Minister for having clarified the position . " Vyvyan Adams , who is always a scathing critic of Mr. Chamberlain on foreign affairs , jumped to his feet to ask : " As it is vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any bewildering embroidery , will the right honorable gentleman invite The Times to refrain from embellishing or belittling it ? " This was a sarcastic reference to an editorial in The Times of London immediately after the original guarantee to Poland that suggested Britain was not guaranteeing Poland 's " integrity " but only her " independence . " The Times 's interpretation was speedily repudiated by the Foreign Office in an official assurance to the Polish Ambassador . This time The Times underlines every point of Mr. Chamberlain 's statement by declaring that " Poland holds on to her legal position in Danzig as to a lifeline , " and that the " unconditional incorporation of Danzig in the Reich would completely overturn the present balance and structure of Europe . " The ay to negotiation still lies open , The Times declares , but any change against Poland 's wishes is barred . In the lobbies at Westminster it was felt that Mr. Chamberlain 's statement might lead to a few weeks of calm over the Danzig question and perhaps a friendly settlement in the end . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop of Germany and Col. Gen. Walther von Brauchitsch , Commander in ChieZ of the German Army , were on vacation , and that Count Galeazzo Ciano , the Italian Foreign Minister , was away from home on a visit to Spain . Suspicions Are Dissipated Whether or not the politicians ' hopes here are fulfilled , there are no two opinions about the usefulness of Mr. Chamberlain 's statement or its necessity in the present circumstances . Here and abroad there had been new suspicions that Mr. Chamberlain would try to slip through the gaps in his original guarantee to Poland and do nothing in the event of a " peaceful " change in Danzig ; these suspicions have disappeared except among those who simply can not trust the present government as long as Mr. Chamberlain is in office . Anglo-Polish financial delegates met today , with a representative of the French Embassy present . The Poles have asked for a huge sum , about f50,000,000 , in loans and credits . This is about twice as much as they expect to receive . The British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? f8,000,000 in credits and ? 10 , - 000,000 in a loan  --  which is less than they have given Turkey and is undoubtedly less than they are willing to give the Poles in the end . Hard bargaining is going on , but as the British can not afford to let the Poles go home disgruntled there is bound to be a satisfactory agreement before long . As for the Russian negotiations Whitehall was somewhat more hopeful today than on reading press reports last night . A full report had not yet come from the British Ambassador , Sir William Seeds , but the French Government received an official report from Moscow today indicating that the Russians had not asked for anything inherently unreasonable in last night 's threehour discussion . Officials here believe the negotiators can continue another fortnight at least without having to change the basis of discussion and give up the idea of a military alliance . It is possible that today 's pledge about Danzig  --  so much more specific than anything that had preceded it  --  will help convince the Russians as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
