LIFE BEING THE BEST A STORY BY KAY BOYLE T HE school-teacher 's name was Mr. Virgil : a lean , loving , scholarly young mart who had no wife as yet . Whatever he had in care and passion went out to the altering natures of his pupils . He drove their thoughts from one thing to the next even as they themselves coerced the cattle piece by piece down the road in the evening ; he burned uneasily in their hearts because of his pure exalted eye . They had no explanation for him , nor could they talk of him among themselves without shifting and smiling , because the words he used were never on anyone else 's tongue in the country : such things as " the might of thought , " and " the power of the soul , " he spoke of , and undid Jesus from the cross and made a wounded weeping man of him . Whenever Mr. Virgil came out under the olive trees where the boys were playing they fell silent a moment as if a great man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have such a man for a change , for he never lifted a hand to them . There were parents who had no patience with this and they made up for it at home . But no one could say that the boys were wilder this year than any other , and their lessons were better learned with him than with any man before him . Palavicini spoke the softest words of all for Mr. Virgil . He said , " This year my son is pleasant and kind , the way he was before my wife died . " On an early morning in June they might be seen , Mr. Virgil and Young Palavicini , walking up to the schoolhouse together under the low , silvery boughs . The boy was thin and stained dark by the mountains , and his hair curled up black on his head , while Mr. Virgil had been laved pale by ablutions of learning , had been made a gaunt man of because of his pacings to and fro in the asylum of his mind . Over their heads the olives were taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twig . " All things are to be learned from books , " Mr. Virgil was saying . " So you should have the patience to learn . All earthly , " he began gently , but suddenly he must skip aside to avoid an island of cow-dung in the path , " and all unearthly things . Take care , do n't soil your boots , Palavicini , " he said , and with his hand on the boy 's shoulder they walked on under the olive branches . " It gives you a certain kind of power to know many things . " This was the way they came to school together in the morning , and Mr. Virgil , with his open palm resting on the tree 's flank , said , " A tree is armed by nature with its bark , and an enlightened man is armed with knowledge . Take Jupiter , for instance . Do you remember how he held the thunderbolt high in his right hand ? " But before Young Palavicini could speak of these things he must disguise and hush his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shame him . " Or Jesus , " he said hoarsely , " with his cross . Every time I 've seen Jesus he had hold of it . " " No , " said Mr. Virgil , gravely but sweetly , " that is n't the real meaning . " " Oh , yes , I 'm sure , " Young Palavicini said . " Oh , yes , I remember . That 's why we left Italy , Chiesa 's people and mine . After awhile everybody in Italy had to put a black shirt on or else Jesus came along and made trouble . " " No , " said Mr. Virgil gently . " You must be thinking of someone else , Palavicini . Jesus lived a long time ago . " " Yes , yes , " said the boy , " yes , I know . He was in jail once for socialism . There was a photograph of him being taken away by the carabinieri . " Mr. Virgil did not speak but reached his hand above his head and broke off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his pocket and opened the blade out with the nail of his thumb . " Look here , Palavicini , " he said , and he ran the black bark off under the knife 's edge . There lay the drying wood revealed , stainless and white below . " Knowledge can do this thing to your mind , " he said softly . " It can be like a sharp knife whittling your thoughts clean for you . " So he spoke of it , as though knowledge were a light that might suddenly be cast down in glory upon the hearts of children . But Young Palavicini stood still a long while , watching the stick come clean , with his own thoughts moving slothful and slow in his head . " Think of when your papa goes hunting , " said Mr. Virgil , and he looked softly and winningly into the boy 's face . " Now what is the first thing he would take ? " He paused there in the fresh morning light and looked in hope and tenderness at Young Palavicini . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could not perceive what he was expected now to say . After a little he said : " First he would borrow the umbrella from Chiesa 's people , " and the light of pleasure died in Mr. Virgil 's face . " No , no , " said the schoolmaster quickly . " Now let us think about it . " He lifted his head , as though the gift and rhapsody must come from elsewhere and purify his tongue lest he speak out of the bigotry of man toward child . " Let us think of your papa going hunting , " he said . " He is going out after partridge or after hare . " " Chiesa runs like a hare if you turn on him , " said Young Palavicini , and the corners of his mouth went down as if the taste were bad . " Ah , do n't speak ill of the other boys ! " said Mr. Virgil sadly . " Chiesa should be close as a brother to you . You came from the same country at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen how he runs with his toes out ? " said Young Palavicini , the words falling fast from his mouth . " Have you seen the smile on his face , and the dirt on his neck , and the tongue hanging out when he stands at the window watching . " until Mr. Virgil clapped his hands over his ears and cried out : " I 've heard enough , Palavicini ! We were speaking of your papa going off into the woods . What is it he takes with him , carried over his shoulder ? " The two of them halted now and stood silent , looking into each other 's face as they stood on the whitish grass . Down behind went the low hills , and the orchards and the vineyards of the country , wan and pale with the shallow greens and lemons of the South . Mr. Virgil 's lips were parted now and a tentacle of hope was reaching across his features ; but the little boy stood speechless and seemingly thoughtless , with his eyes gone black and ignorant in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know . " " But of course your papa would take his gun ! " cried Mr. Virgil , laughing . " Do n't you see ? If he 's going out hunting he takes his gun , and when he hears a sound or a rustle of life , " said the schoolmaster warily , " he takes aim like this , " and here he fell upon one knee and lifted the whittled olive-branch to his shoulder . " He takes aim , like this , and then when the bird or the animal comes out he pulls the trigger and lets the bullet fly . " " Oh , yes , " said Young Palavicini , watching Mr. Virgil get to his feet again . " That 's the way knowledge can be used , " said the schoolmaster , brushing the white dust of the soil from his knees . A few more steps and they had come to the threshold of the schoolhouse . There Mr. Virgil put the key in the lock of the door . " Just as bullets fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " so you can let powerful words spring from your tongue and serve as deadly weapons . " He pushed the door open and they walked in , submerged at once in the lake of swimming light within the room . Mr. Virgil stepped onto the platform that held his desk on high , and his hands ran over the papers , settling edge to edge in order the sheets of tall childish lettering the boys had written in strong purple ink . Young Palavicini sat on the bench below and crossed his hands on his knees . " God came in and cried all night , Mr. Virgil , " he said , " the time my mother died . " " No , " said the schoolmaster gently , sorting the papers from one side to the other in his hands . " No , it must have been somebody else , Palavicini . " He did not lift his eyes from the work on his desk before him . " Yes , he was wearing a black dress , " said Young Palavicini . " But when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one side and did it standing up the way a man does . And afterwards he got drunk when he was crying and he fell under the table and he and papa slept all night on the floor . I remember it . God would n't go home until he had his beads back out of the bottle where they had fallen into , and they could n't get the beads out until they had finished the bottle . " Suddenly Mr. Virgil stepped down from the platform and walked around the end of the bench , and there sat down beside the little boy . He sat close to him on the wood , on the thick pewlike timber that was polished high by the impatience of young backsides shifting for a good sight out the window . He put his scholarly hand on the little boy 's brow and his fingers drew back the dark loose hair . There he sat close to him on the form , with his arm about him , soft as a mother might do . He said , " God is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mouth . " He passes through all things and through the flesh even , but unseen , and always unharmed . " The little boy , held close against the schoolmaster 's ribs , shook his head at these words . " No , " he said , " I saw him . He had a sore toe from coming so far that night , and my sister put brandy on it . He had a round blue mark , sitting like a crown in the middle of his hair . " When he came home from school in the evening he would take the skins off the vegetables in haste and fling them into the pot of water on the coals , scarcely taking the carrots ' hides off , or the dirt , for all the hate he had in him for the work he was doing . There was a glass in the room that gave him a sight of his own face ; but what was there in it but a well of fury for all the things to be done , the storm of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white as tapers ? The lane between the two rows of houses was still , for the other boys played out on the square where the highroad passed and elegant cars went by from better places . From the window he could hear their voices calling and even taste the veil of dust that moved forth , as if borne from the highway and laid over the light walls of the street . Whenever it was a lorry that passed instead , he knew it by the dishes quaking on the shelf and the smell of castor-oil left hanging on the air . He stood at the window , listening to the boys beyond , and he himself given in anger to the evening meal , captive , like any old woman in her kitchen . In this window and out the door the wind had blasted , sucking grandmother , and then the aunt , and last the mother out , rattling them , bone and skin , one by one out the doorway . The thoughts in his head were of the room of death in the house that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through it . One year it was the first , and the next the other who went out the door , and now there was only one woman left : there was the sister left to come walking down over the cobbles in the evening , stepping high on her angular heels from bucking stone to stone . The lane was still , but he knew that in a little while the boys would be returning . He carried the tin pitchers out in his hands , and he lingered by the fountain in the soft , failing hour , dividing the water 's strong flow in his fingers , as the mesh of a stout ropemight be undone and done again . In a while he brought the pitchers back , slopping over with water , leaving a trail of black pursuant steps behind him on the cobbles as he came . He stood for a moment at the door , harking to the voices of Chiesa and the others on the square , standing alone but turning his thoughts of loneliness aside , like stray sheep turned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first to return down the lane , skipping from side to side of it . His hair was cut close on his skull and his face was bleached by the platters of spaghetti and sauce that were always set before him . When he saw Young Palavicini on the step he jumped sideways to his own door . " Hello , " said Young Palavicini , scarcely speaking aloud . " Hello , " said Chiesa , with his lip drawn smartly back . Young Palavicini looked shyly across at Chiesa on the other side . " What makes of cars was it drove by this evening ? " he said faintly . " What 's that to you ? " said Chiesa , and his tongue ran out through his teeth in scorn . " Cooks , " he said , " should keep their noses in their kitchens . " He skipped into the house at this , stamping his heels like a slippery hare in flight . Young Palavicini leaned down for the pitchers of spring-water and bore them into the house in silence . But there he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with burning glance to glance . Now he could no longer woo or bend his thought , and up the stony flights of fury leaped the wild scattered flock . He could hear the cries from their bleating mouths as they went past him , and the slip of their hoofs seeking foothold in the treacherous shale . Once they had reached the top , he knew they would turn on themselves and swoop down in terror upon him . and he could not head them elsewhere . Whatever weapons of speech Mr. Virgil might have whittled for him , the wild fire of his anger would have taken them for kindling now . What do you find in him to hold against him ? he could hear Mr. Virgil 's far voice complaining . But the flames of his rage snapped up berry and bush , and sent the sparks cracking to heaven . The dark trees of Mr. Virgil 's patience shrivelled and writhed in their burning needles and spat out their juices on the fiery forest moss . Have you seen how his hair grows , how his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifts ? ? came the furious pack cantering , cantering in rhythm over the smoldering ground . Have you seen the seat of his pants , the back of his neck , the green in his eye , his mouth twisting up when a question 's put , his velvet on Sunday , the tail off his cat , have you seen him cleaning his teeth with his fingernail ? Down swept the pack with the fire licking behind them , driving them thirsting and frenzied against the scorching vineyard wall . There the clamor of their soft hot feet gone mad for succor stampeded Young Palavicini under . Have you seen how he eats , drinks , jumps , whistles , owns the best cars passing , spits , swings , screams laughing , tears , lies , blows his nose in his apron , sucks his spaghetti , cries , strikes , have you seen it , Mr. Virgil , have you seen it , have you seen it ? .. . So he was standing , holding to the chair for support , staring still into the glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store . " Is the soup on yet ? " she said first in the summer darkness ; and Young Palavicini said , " Yes , the supper is on , " scarcely able to speak from the fury that had spent him . She had walked into the fading room again and caught him at it , like any other evening caught him before the glass , ironeye to eye , storming . She might even see through to the thoughts of his head , see his temper swooning now in his blood . But instead she sat down on a chair with her hat on the back of her head . She was dressed like an idle lady , in imitation of the idle ladies her poverty served . " I 'm tired , I 'm tired , " she said , so gently that the whole darkening room crept suddenly into her lap and burst out crying . " I 'm tired , " she said , and the light from the street came softly into the room , as Mr. Virgil might , and set back the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omelette in a minute , " she said . " I 'll put something together for a change . I 'll see you eat proper . " But by this time the room of itself was nodding , sleeping , snoring . " I 'll feed you up , " said his sister , with the room rocked soft in her arms . Young Palavicini stood quiet by the window . Her legs had fallen apart and lay like dead men in her skirts . " In just a minute , " she said . " In just a minute . " He saw the lamplight spring up in the windows of Chiesa 's house , and the brothers and sisters there sit down to supper at the table . The mother moved from place to place , as his mother had done , setting the full plates of food before them . He could see Chiesa 's black apron buttoned up to the back of his neck , and the movement of his jaw on his food as he bowed his shaved head and ate . By Thursday a floating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Mr. Virgil had said they would walk to the monastery together whatever the weather might be . The two of them set out early , with their bread and their cheese in their pockets , and the obscurity bound fast as white silk on their eyes . If the schoolmaster had not known the way so well , they might have mistaken it even at the outset when they were still climbing warily through the stems of the young black pines . But he knew the curve and the feature of every branch as if they were human faces , and he knew very well how the path took its ease across the foothills . " If it starts in to rain , it will be a good thing , " said Mr. Virgil , " for the rain will clear the mist away . " The path led them up and on , but there was no sense of toil or climbing ; except for the breath running hard in their bodies , they might have believed they were walking on level ground . The maquis and the heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was only through memory they knew that a great valley was now opening out to the side . To Young Palavicini it seemed the air came fresher here : whether it was that he knew in his mind how the river 's valley lay deep and wide below , or whether for the sight of the mist taking shape on the unseen edge and falling , wraith by wraith , into the seething vapors of the vacant place . Here they breathed deeply , but there was no sign of the smoke from their mouths on the air ; and Mr. Virgil said : " If life is the best of all good things , Palavicini , then what would the worst of all evils be ? " But just as he spoke the call of a bird rang out from the invisible trees , calling " Cuckoo , " tentatively , far but clear . The schoolmaster lifted his head in pleasure and , looking toward Young Palavicini , he laid his finger on his own lips . The boy could see the sound taking shape slowly in Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " pronounced the schoolmaster in answer , calling out the same clear wondrous sound . It might have been no more than a drop of water falling into hollowness , the bird 's All Good Things , Then Murder ' ? or let us say homicide ? ' Then Homicide is the Worst of All Evils . ' " As the bird cried out its sad , strange note again , Young Palavicini said , " What is homicide ? " " The act of dealing death to another , " said Mr. Virgil . " Cuckoo ! " he called out with fervor . " You remember the story of Cain and Abel . When one man kills another , Palavicini , that is homicide . " The altering scale of the bird 's question came wondering , querying , troubled on the air . But now Mr. Virgil had no ears for it . He had halted on the perilous high path and turned to face the boy over the clear separate place their two bodies hollowed in the fog . " Yes , " he said ardently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out such argument . It will make things clear for your own eyes , just as God might breathe upon it now and blow this mist away . You are all so different , you boys , " said Mr. Virgil , " so that each of your declarations will he different . You and Chiesa , for instance , as different as two boys could be . " But suddenly the bitter taste of that name came cold in the little boy 's mouth . " Chiesa . I hate Chiesa , " he said . " No , " said the schoolmaster strongly , " I do not believe it . " He laid his arm over Young Palavicini 's shoulders , and he said , " We will talk of this theme as we go on together . " But the bird , calling out in concern for its love 's direction , interrupted them again . " Cuckoo ! " said the bird , speaking low and clear from the forest . " Cuckoo ! Cuckoo ! " Mr. Virgil turned his head and said . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth from the mist , and the trees , lying newly felled near the path , were visible on the ground . The place had been left to fall to ruin for many years past , but the archway that rose before them was still unbroken , wide and high , with seats struck under its shelter out of the powerful stone . A dozen men riding abreast might have passed through it with case were it not for the dark ivy that now would catch in their hair . The courtyard within was ankle-deep with soft wet muck , a black stubborn despair that sucked at their boots and clung fast to their soles beneath them as they crossed . It was a great open court , with the floor of it done over and over with the marks of goats ' hoofs ; mist hung like curtains at the ends of the mighty place , but the center was cleared away as if for dancing . The bird did not follow them here , having come so far after them , but was left calling out endlessly with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the schoolmaster and the little boy walked into the court , a window came open in the monks ' habitation , and a woman leaned out and spoke in greeting . " Well , then , here I am again ! " Mr. Virgil called out in a high , gay voice , and two lean dogs came wailing down the wornout stone . The schoolmaster took off his hat to her , and his short hair stood up in disorder against the heavy weather . She was a plump , dark-eyed woman , and dimples ran into her checks when she smiled . Mr. Virgil stood tall as a tree in the courtyard , and the two dogs smelled back and forth across his shoes . The woman closed the window , and in a moment she came to the doorway with a shawl laid over her shoulders , and the dogs moved uneasily , in suspicion of Mr. Virgil and the boy . " Come in , " said the woman . " Come in . You must be wet to your skins in this weather . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not alter when one dog lifted his hind-leg and quietly watered Mr. Virgil 's leg . The schoolmaster was looking straight into the woman 's face and he took no notice either . " Here 's one of my best lads I 've brought with me , " said Mr. Virgil , and he dropped his hand in love on Young Palavicini 's shoulders . " He 's a beautiful child , " said the woman . They mounted the steps together and he shook her dark soft hand . Here in the room there was a great fire burning , for this was the old-time eating place of the religious men . The schoolmaster hung his cloak by the side of the flames , and there it was shining and dripping at once from the weight of soaking mist it had borne . The chimney was so large and tall that the woman bade Young Palavicini to step inside it and sit down on the stool in the corner . This he did , and put out his wet boots to the fire , but the woman said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be getting chilblains on your feet . Take your boots off and set your stockings aside . " But Young Palavicini could not bear to take off his boots before her , nor before the schoolmaster , nor before the young children who stood gazing at the sight of him there . Once his foot was out of his shoe they would see the state of his stockings . Mr. Virgil sat down at his ease , and pointed out the carving on the stones about them . " Take off your shoes then , " said Mr. Virgil , but Young Palavicini sat silent . In a moment the woman came back and set down a loaf on the table , and when she saw the boy sitting so shamedby the fire , she stepped onto the hearthstones herself and knelt down . " Here , let me have your feet , " she said , and she ran her fingers under thelacings . " I 've a son of my own as big as you , " she said . From where she knelt by the burning wood she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as coals , and her cheeks blushing from the flame . " Where 's the husband and the son to-day ? " said Mr. Virgil . " They 're out with the goats , " she said rising . She took the blackened kettle off the irons and poured the water from it into a copper pan . " I can give you butter and fresh cheese and cherries at once , " she said to the schoolmaster as she knelt again . " But for warm milk , you 'll have to wait till the goats come in . " " Ah , we 've brought enough food along to keep us , " said Mr. Virgil . He sat watching her dip the boy 's red feet into the pan of water and he said , " I 'm afraid there may be trouble , Mrs. Marincola , about the trees that you 've taken down . " " I 've washed my feet already this week , " said the boy softly . But the woman gave no sign of hearing , but rubbed the soap well into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the woman began , with a shadow fallen on her . " It wo n't come from me , " said Mr. Virgil , smiling gently . " No , " said Mrs. Marincola . " I 'm sure of that . " She took Young Palavicini 's feet into the apron on her lap , and she said , " How is it there 're such great holes in his stockings ? " " He 's a good boy , Palavicini , " said the schoolmaster quickly . " He takes care of his own house as well as a woman might . He gets home from school in time to start the supper for his father and his sister . His father 's a mason , and his sister works in a shop in the city . His mother died of the influenza a year and a half ago . " The woman took the boy 's feet close in her hands . " I want her son to come to the schoolhouse too , " said Mr. Virgil smiling at Young Palavicini . " We live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she chafed the boy 's feet in the palms of her hands . " I 've told you before , if he can go out all day on the hills with the goats , he can come as far as the schoolhouse , " said Mr. Virgil . " How could he get home in the night ? " said the woman . " He could n't come so far alone . " " You 've no right to keep your son away from school , " said Mr. Virgil sternly . " Listen , " said Mrs. Marincola , speaking with the boy 's feet pressed close in the soft bosom of her dress . " I 've told you too how it was when we came from Italy . We tried to live in a town then , and you know how hard it was , Mr. Virgil , with the language to learn , and the working-papers you ca n't get for money or anything . You know very well how my husband was almost a year without working . " " Yes , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away into the flame . " I told you how we had to live some way or another , " she said , " and here was this monastery crying for habitation . Now we have money put aside with the goats we have , three hundred now , Mr. Virgil . If there 's anything said about the trees we can pay whatever it is they 're worth . " " Yes , " said Mr. Virgil . " Yes , yes , I know . " They had no more than finished the lunch she set out for them on the table , than a great murmuring of life arose from the courtyard or from the forest beyond . A great music of bells and of voices bleating came crowding and pressing through the windows . " There are the goats , " said the woman , and she jumped up to clear offthe table . Young Palavicini , in the other boy 's sheepskin slippers , went shyly out the door to see . The goats had just begun to enter the courtyard , coming one by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepping warily and choosing their direction , as if bringing the others behind them to safety at last . Outside the arch the mist stood close , seemingly sealed against the stone 's open mouth , but still the flock of goats took shape in it , hoof by hoof , near to the ground only , as a curtain would stir and show the feet of many little dancers below its hem . One after another the shy beasts came , speaking one another 's names uncertainly in sweet bewildered tones . They came stepping over the black soft muck with their long coats hanging coarse and clean and the bells at their throats ringing clearly . But when they saw the boy and the schoolmaster standing on the step they threw up their heads and set to charging wildly around the courtyard 's rim . One look from the ends of their yellow eyes was enough to send them cavorting in fright and pleasure the length of the monks ' forsaken yard . In poured the goats , faster and faster through the archway , some as white as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy 's arm . In the center of all the tumult , the great he-goats paired and locked their mighty cornucopias together , buckled and smote each other 's weapons , pressed in their fury brow to brow . The goatlings ran by their mothers ' sides , weeping , their own little horns no bigger than toadstools on their heads . In a while the three hundred beasts were herded into the courtyard , and then came the man and his son , with their blankets and sticks , and their shepherd 's capes on them , walking dark and hooded out of the deepening mist . Young Palavicini stood by the door even after the others had entered , listening to the Italian words that passed among them . The young children kissed their father 's face and kissed their brother , and the woman went from one to the other , bearing their wet things away . Mr. Virgil cast a new log onto the fire , bringing it with difficulty for all his strength , from the corner of the room to the chimney 's blackened floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk from the goat 's bags they all drank of it , sitting at the table with the cheese and the bread and the cherries set out afresh as they had been before . But when Mr. Virgil saw that young Palavicini was not among them , he walked out to the doorway and drew him in . " Come in , come in , " he said . " We 've a long way to go and you must warm yourself through before we start . " There they all sat at the round table , speaking of many things ; but the schoolmaster did not bring up the question of school again , perhaps because of the uselessness of it , or perhaps because of the shadow of grievance it would cause to fall upon their faces . The woman was drawing her needle and the black wool in and out through Young Palavicini 's stocking , mending it whole over her hand as she talked or gave ear to her husband 's laughter . The son sat near to Young Palavicini , and in a while he leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tin cup of goat 's milk before him . " This is for you , " he said , and his own teeth were stained black with the fruit . " All these ? " said Young Palavicini . " Yes , " said the other one , " yes , all . " They sat close to each other , with their backs going hot at the fire , so close that Young Palavicini could smell the strong odor of beasts and rain that dried on the other 's coat . " You may keep my sheepskin slippers , " said Young Marincola , with his voice scarcely heard above the talk of the older people . " To take home ? " said Young Palavicini , but he did not turn his head . " Yes , " said the other , " to take home when you go . " After a little the father began singing to them . The bottle of red wine had turned to beauty in his blood , and he flung up his head and tossed back the black hair that fell across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dove , your wings shall rise again ! " he sang , and his voice shook loud and loving against the solemn stone . His face was round and rich with health , and his teeth as white as a dog 's teeth in his mouth . From his short dark neck , loud enough to make a boy hide his face in shame , there rose in fervor this wondrous tide of sound . " Oh , every child of Italy , save courage for the day when , galley-slaves no longer , we will cast the chains away ! " he sang , until the tears ran down the woman 's face and she wiped them off with the back of her hand . When Young Palavicini looked at the Marincolas he felt the breath come short in his own heart . Suddenly the woman turned her soft face to Young Palavicini , and she said : " What kind of a life has this poor one now with no one to look out for him ? He should be with his own people , coming from the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , laughing . " You do n't want to take one of my best lads from me , do you , Mrs. Marincola ? " he said , shaking his head in jest at the woman . But now he fastened his cloak under his chin , for the hour had come for them to go . The woman put the warm stockings back on Young Palavicini 's feet again and buttoned his jacket over . " You will bring him again , Mr. Virgil ? " she said , and she kissed the two sides of the boy 's face . " Yes , " said the schoolmaster , " for I will come every week , either the Thursday or the Sunday , until you let your boy come to the schoolhouse as well . " The husband went down the steps before them , leading them through the cold precipitant bodies of the goats lying in the courtyard ; he came as far as the archway , and then the schoolmaster and the little boy went on alone down the covert hill . Near sunset the change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the valley was drained clear with twilight as they came walking home . They came down through the olive-orchards and the vineyards ; and the tree-trunks , and the rocks , and now the roofs beginning stood sharp and single as if coming forth refreshed from rest . They did not speak for peace and contentment , but descended thinking of how the day had passed . But when they came to the highroad above the town , it seemed a long smooth beach on which the tides of silence must break at last . The other boys were still playing out on the square , and the sound of their voices traveled high and far . But as if to save himself the sight of them , Mr. Virgil halted before they came to the center of the town and put out his hand to Young Palavicini . " Life Being the Best of All Good Things , " he said softly . " Keep it in mind , Palavicini . " He took the boy 's hand in his and he said , " Good-night . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-morrow . " Young Palavicini stood silent , holding to the schoolmaster 's hand . And thank you , my God , my Love , saidhis heart , but his lips would have none of it . Keep me now from going home to that face in the glass , cried his sorrow , but his mouth would not utter . Instead he stood staring wildly into Mr. Virgil 's magic hand . He could see how the lines coursed this way and that on it , but he could not speak out his love for their directions . Instead he said : " Good-night , Mr. Virgil , " and went walking the other way . Down one street and up another he went to keep himself too from the sight of the boys playing . It was nothing to him to-day that he could not be out on the square with them , but he must keep apart to remember the better the memories in his head . He turned down the lane to his own house and opened the door of it . There was the stove waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were the vegetables , stiff as dead men on the table , waiting for water and fire to bring them life again . The house was bleak and silent , but behind each door some menace seemed to linger . He thought of the father 's voice singing , and of the mother 's hand lifted to wipe the tears from her face . Even the goats up there were warm and soft with promise , and the strong male goats had turned gentle beside their children . He was thinking of these things and emptying the ashes from the stove , when somebody struck the window-glass . Chiesa was looking in from the street , and Young Palavicini crossed the kitchen and opened the window . " Ilello , " said Chiesa . " Hello , " Young Palavicini said . " What are you having for supper ? " said Chiesa , and he drew his grin up sharp in his face . " We 're having tomato sauce on our spaghetti ! " Young Palavicini saw the small black eyes button and unbutton uneasily before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorn , " I know where you 've been . " Young Palavicini lifted his hand to close the window , and Chiesa dropped his head as though expecting a blow . Then he began to titter alnud from the street where he stood . " You 've been with the outlaws , " he said , hiding his mouth in his hand and his laughter . " You 've been up to the monastery where the police are going to get them for cutting the trees down . My father passed there yesterday and he 's going to tell what they done . " No thought had come or gone in Young Palavicini 's head , but he turned and walked out of the kitchen and intohis father 's room . He walked to the table by the bed , and each move he made seemed shaped by preparation . This he had thought , or had dreamed , or had done in this same way before . He took the blue box from the drawer and took the cover from it , and then he climbed on the rush-bottomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took down his father 's gun from the wall . Once it was loaded he went back to the kitchen and stood before the open window . Across the lane , Chiesa had his foot on his own doorstep and when Young Palavicini called out his name he spun round smiling . IN TIME OF FROST BY MARGARET EMERSON BA/LEY W HEN frost is in the air and red leaves fall , I know how unwise gardeners mark with string Some special plant , the loveliest of all , To bring inside for sheltering till spring . And I know well when the long autumn rains Have turned to hail or settled in to snow , How no sun , slanting through white window panes , Will force new leaves or make new petals grow . Then out of pity , do not ask to live What can not stand the thinnest coat of sleet . My utmost love lies in its power to give In brief abundance through midsummer heat . Struck down by frost , pierced by one bitter breath , Oh ? let love die in full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
