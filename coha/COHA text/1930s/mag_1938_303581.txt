Because Mrs. Sarah Oliver Hulswit , head of an anti-New Deal crusade called the Women 's Rebellion , asked ( unsuccessfully ) Attorney General David T. Wilentz* of New Jersey to enforce against WPA workers an old New Jersey statute ( ten other States have similar laws ) denying to paupers the right to vote , President Roosevelt last week grew highly sarcastic in press conference . The " ladies ' proposal , " he snorted , was about as democratic as it would be to limit voters to male holders of B.A. degrees . While he was on the subject he went on also to denounce poll taxes as a relic of the Revolutionary era . ( He recently endorsed a movement to repeal the poll tax in Arkansas . ) <P> Knowing well that the poll tax is the chief device whereby Southern Democrats prevent Negroes from voting , the wariest politician in the U.S. quickly added that in condemning the poll tax he was not talking about Negroes . They , he said , were a problem to be handled separately . At this remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Roosevelt had publicly mentioned one of the most delicate aspects of his new Liberal party . Virginia 's Senator Carter Glass declared that Franklin Roosevelt had exhibited " an absolutely superficial knowledge of the matter . " <P> To many Southern Democrats , it was strong medicine when in 1932 Franklin Roosevelt wooed the Northern Black Belt as no Democrat had done in mortal memory . When he gave Negroes prominent seats at his inauguration , put them in bigger jobs than they ever held in a Democratic administration , Southern Democrats tried hard to swallow it as political expediency . Such demagogues as Georgia 's Eugene Talmadge gagged for public edification when , during the 1936 campaign , Mrs. Roosevelt was photographed between two young Negro officers of the R.O.T.C. at Washington 's Howard University . But in this year 's primary fight , Demagogue Talmadge 's fire has been directed at Roosevelt 's wooing Negro votes far below the Mason-Dixon line . Moreover , for the first time in years , South Carolina 's Ellison D. ( " Cotton Ed " ) Smith , who walked out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was called on to pray , last month managed to put some life into his traditional campaign plank : White Supremacy . <P> Other notable points in the present relations of Southern Negroes and the New Deal : <P> In South Carolina no one can vote in general elections without a poll tax receipt , but any white man can enter a primary by putting his name down in a book ( often kept in a grocery store ) . This year some 20,000 Negroes were allowed to put their names down , a piece of official colorblindness far more advantageous to New Dealer Johnston than to unreconstructed " Cotton Ed " Smith . <P> In Oklahoma , where there is no poll tax , 60,000 of the State 's 225,000-odd Negroes registered this year , an all-time high . Of these , 45,000 signed up as Democrats . When Franklin Roosevelt appeared in Oklahoma City in behalf of his friend Senator Elmer Thomas , Negroes were allotted 300 seats in the grandstand . Mr. Thomas ' Negro campaign managers claimed their man got 90% of the Negro vote .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
