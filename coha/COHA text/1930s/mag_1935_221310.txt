Sorrows of a Hanfstaengl <P> A copy of TIME , Sept. 10 , 1934 was handed up in King 's Bench division last week for the inspection of Hon. Mr. Justice Swift . After scrutinizing it with care , His Lordship ventured , " It is apparently an American publication . " Subject of the trial was a libel suit against Baron Beaverbrook 's London Daily Express by intuitive Adolf Hitler 's magnetic friend Dr. Ernst Franz Sedgwick ( " Putzy " ) Hanfstaengl . The gigantic Nazi Doktor is given to moments of extreme nervous excitement which he calms by striding about his office and inhaling great whiffs from a small green crystal bottle of smelling salts . From TIME the Daily Express had picked up and reprinted the fact that Putzy in one of these nervous moments exclaimed to Manhattan Lawyer William Ormonde Thompson , onetime partner of Clarence Darrow : " Damn those Oxford professors ! I will send some of our swine to burn down their Oxford ! " Lawyer Thompson , duly brought to London from New York last week , declared under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as quoted . What had wrought Putzy up to speak in this fashion , Mr. Thompson testified , was a reference to the condemnation of Nazi methods by numerous Britons , including some prominent Oxonians . At this provocation not even smelling salts could prevent Putzy from flying wrathfully off the handle . In court last week Dr. Hanfstaengl , admirably composed , declared , " Such a statement as the one attributed to me could only have been made by a man of violent and vulgar temper . " In an injured tone the big man continued softly , " What hurt me most was the idea that somebody would say I would burn down the finest seat of learning in the Anglo-Saxon world . It is just like saying I would burn down Goethe 's or Schiller 's house . ... I did not roar at Thompson , I did ask him , ' What would they say if those Communists burnt down their Oxford ? ' "
