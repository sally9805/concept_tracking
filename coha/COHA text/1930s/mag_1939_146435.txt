Like sopranos , unlike basses and baritones , tenor voices go to seed early . When golden-voiced Enrico Caruso died at 48 , he had passed his prime . Jean de Reszke and gut-busting Francesco Tamagno retired at 51 . But not yet retired is Giovanni Martinelli , 53 , robust , white-mopped tenor who made his debut at Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera the year before the War . Never the undisputed best of the Metropolitan 's chandelier-jigglers , Martinelli has been a dependable artist in an enormous repertory ( 57 roles ) . In two operas , Verdi 's Otello and Halevy 's La Juive , critics found him first-rate . Although a little worn at the edges , Martinelli 's voice is still serviceable . To his sunny , bouncing personality , his fellow artists paid tribute at the completion of his 25th season last year ( TIME , March 28 , 1938 ) . Last week , as Martinelli vacationed in Italy , the Metropolitan announced that it had signed him on for the 2jth year-a record for a big-league tenor .
