Up to last year Douglas D. H. March , a tall , curly-haired , young snake collector from Haddon Heights , N. J. , had been bitten 14 times by nine varieties of poisonous snake-fer-de-lance. moccasin , copperhead , palm viper . Godman 's viper and four subspecies of rattlesnake . Doctors told him that one more bite would probably be the last . Mused he : " I like to say that I am through handling snakes forever , but I know I 'm not . " Last week Snakeman March emerged unbitten from the jungles of Panama 's Darien district proudly bearing to his new serpentarium in Old Panama City a live , nine-ft. specimen of the most dangerous snake in the American tropics-the bushmaster . <P> One of the few persons who envied him his catch was Dr. Raymond Lee Ditmars , famed herpetologist of New York 's Bronx Zoo . Ever since the night some 40 years ago when a bushmaster , sent by a Trinidad collector , chased him around his attic room , Dr. Ditmars has had a special regard for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last one died 20 years ago . He went to Panama looking for one last year , again this year , with no luck . <P> The bushmaster ranges from southern Costa Rica to northern Brazil . Studded like a pineapple , its waxy , glistening scales are pale reddish yellow crossed with diamond-shaped black patches on the back . It may be the progenitor of the whole pit viper family , of which it is the longest . The group includes rattlesnake , moccasin , copperhead , fer-de-lance . On the end of the bushmaster 's tail is a slender horn , possibly a vestigial set of rattles . Like the rest of the family , it has a deep pit on either side of its big , blunt snout . It is the only member which lays eggs , usually nesting in deserted armadillo holes . It grows up to 12 ft. long . Its enormously developed fangs look like a sabre-toothed tiger 's . <P> Calm and fearless , the bushmaster is one of the rare snakes ( others : African mamba , Malayan king ) which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is slightly less toxic than the fer-de-lance 's , it injects far more , hence is deadlier . One human victim died in less than ten minutes . <P> The bushmaster hates captivity . Surrounded by tropical foliage and plenty of food , it goes on a sullen hunger strike . Attempts at forced feeding numb it with rage , paralyze its digestion . It starves to death in four or five months . Snakeman March , now possessor of the only known bushmaster in captivity , may have better luck since he will keep his catch in its native habitat .
