( See Cover ) <P> Nine miles from the heart of Manhattan , on what was once a Flushing ( L. I. ) dump , the biggest world 's fair in history opens this week . Whether cynics believe it or not , New York 's $156,905,000 show is not " just another fair " but " a lot more fair . " It outdoes Chicago 's $47,000,000 Century of Progress Exposition in showmanship , imagination and spectacle . It completely dwarfs Chicago 's in size : with 200 buildings on 1,2164 acres-on which there are 62 miles of roads and paths , 10,000 trees , one good-sized lake and a lagoon , 2,000,000 shrubs and plants . Fifty-eight nations , two international organizations , 33 States , 76 concessionaires and 1,354 exhibitors are represented . To see the entire fair ( including concessions ) will cost $15 in admissions and will take even an iron man three full days ( to nourish iron men there are 310 eating places ) . <P> Promotion . Like all world 's fairs , this is a business venture , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even . The Century of Progress did manage to net $702,171 , but that was a peewee return on the $47,000,000 investment ( of which $10,000,000 was put up by the fair 's promoters and recovered in full ) . The real return was an estimated $700,000,000 in extra business it drew to Chicago . <P> When Chicago held its fair , the whole city was steamed up-not only the concessionaires and tradesmen , direct beneficiaries , but citizens whose enthusiasm was born of civic pride . The anomaly of the New York fair is that most New Yorkers have been genuinely bored with it . For the cosmopolitan conglomeration that is New York City has less civic interest , is less given to boosterism , than any place in the country . The sole reason New York has a fair , let alone the biggest in history , is that a small , hardheaded group high-pressured the city , the nation and most of Europe into it . <P> Figurehead and real head of the fair is Grover Aloysius Whalen . And the fair as it stands today-a $157,000,000 extroversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the title of greatest salesman alive today . Grover Whalen suggested the fair in 1935 and a civil engineer named Joseph Shadgen came through with a historical excuse-the 150th anniversary of Washington 's inauguration ; Shadgen also suggested the site-a foul ash dump in Corona , L. I. which New York Park Commissioner Robert Moses had long itched to clean up . The original scheme was a fair the size of the Century of Progress . But with the Magnificent Whalen in the driver 's seat and a flashy theme , " Building the World of Tomorrow , " the budget mushroomed threefold . <P> Pressure . New York 's fair is a private business venture set up by 121 incorporators with a board of directors , officers and all the other main adjuncts of an ordinary business enterprise except that it is " nonstock , non-profit , " pays no taxes .
