To the world Press last week went a photograph of a small , solemn baby just four months old . It was the first official portrait of His Celestial Highness Tsugu-no-Miya Akihito , Crown Prince of Japan ( see cut ) . That this sober infant may inherit an empire as great as it is venerable , Japan 's ministers last week risked once more the world 's wrath . <P> Tokyo 's Eiji Amau is a Japanese of distinction . He has very curly hair parted in the middle and he is that useful anonymity referred to in cable dispatches as " a Foreign Office spokesman . " Last week Spokesman Amau assembled most of the foreign correspondents in Tokyo and announced in careful , precise English what was instantly recognized as the most important statement of Japanese policy in the Far East since the famed 21 Demands imposed on China by Japan in 1915 . Excerpts : <P> " Japan is endeavoring to maintain and enhance friendly relations with foreign nations , but Japan considers that , to keep peace and order in East Asia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan considers that no other country except China is in a position to share that responsibility . . . . <P> " Japan will oppose any attempt of China to avail herself of the influence of some other country to repel Japan . . . and also will oppose any effort by China to resist foreigners by bringing other foreigners to bear against them . <P> " Japan expects foreign nations to give consideration to the special situation created by the Manchuria and Shanghai incidents , and to realize that technical or financial assistance to China must attain political significance . . . . <P> " For example , supplying China with war planes , building airdromes and detailing military , instructors or advisers to China , or contracting a loan to provide funds for political uses . . . . Japan will oppose such projects . <P> " Japan is at present in a position to maintain peace in the Far East and does not need the help of others . If the League of Nations should take concerted action in China having political significance , it would be objectionable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace in Asia are backed forcefully , Japan herself may be compelled to resort to force . " <P> Correspondents streaked for their offices . Here was not only the thing for which they had long been waiting-an open declaration of a Japanese Monroe Doctrine , a moral protectorate over China - but also a statement of definite complaints against certain powers , chiefly Germany , the U. S. , Italy , France .
