( See front cover ) <P> The silver trumpets blew and loud shrilled the choir boys : " Vivat ! Vivat Georgius Rex ! " With a rustle like the wind , all the crowded stands of Westminster Abbey rose up with a flash of crimson and ermine , gold , diamonds , silver , blue , scarlet and green . The helmeted Gentlemen-at-Arms snapped to attention and down the deep blue carpet that stretched the full length of the Abbey came George VI to his Coronation with all the pomp and panoply of a medieval ceremony more than 1,000 years old . <P> It was the Middle Ages in the midst of Modern Times-arc lamps , newsreel cameras , a radio microphone hanging high above the chancel , pneumatic tubes to speed copy from the pressbox to the telegraphs downstairs ( see p. 39 ) . The crowd that rose in the Abbey to greet their King was aware of all this . Five months of intensive propaganda had told them what this 1937 Coronation was held for : a gorgeous and expensive pageant of the solidarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a changing world . Most of them had read many times other details of the procession that was moving so slowly towards them . <P> They knew that St. Edward 's Crown , six pounds of jewels and gold and the most important piece of regalia , was being carried by the elderly Marquess of Salisbury , Lord High Steward of England ; that among the nine pages supporting the King 's robe were three young sons of World War heroes , inheritors of their titles : Earl Haig , Earl Jellicoe , Earl Kitchener ; that because of an ancient squabble over precedent , the King 's golden spurs , symbol of knighthood , were carried one apiece by Lord Hastings and Lord Churston ; and that the bearer of the Standard of England had no title at all but was plain Mr. Frank Seaman Dymoke of Scrivelsby Court , who has the hereditary right of being King 's Champion .

What the crowds accepted as thoughtlessly as they accepted the noble groans of the Abbey 's new Coronation organ was the significance of the words spoken . <P> Legally and technically George VI was every inch as much a King the moment after Edward 's abdication was signed as he was after last week 's ceremony . What went on in the Abbey was a purely religious rite sanctifying King George as a monarch , anointing him as a persona mixta ( half priest , half layman ) and inheritor of the divine right of kings . All through the three-hour ceremony , the most important person there was not the King , his nobles or his ministers , but a hawk-nosed old gentleman with a cream- gold cope who stood on a dais as King George approached : The Rt . Hon. and Most Reverend Cosmo Gordon Lang , D.D .. Lord Archbishop of Canterbury , Primate of All England .                   @ @
