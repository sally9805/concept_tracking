ANDREW JACKSON : PORTRAIT OF A PRESIDENT-Marquis James-Bobbs Merrill ( $5 ) . <P> With his Pulitzer-Prizewinning biography of Sam Houston ( The Raven ) and the first volume of a biography on Andrew Jackson ( Andrew Jackson : The Border Captain ) , Marquis James has made a name for himself as one of the few conscientious U. S. historians whose books give the historical novelists a run for their money . Last week , in his concluding volume on Andrew Jackson , Author James offers a frankly-hinted explanation : ' ' Many good writers , " he avers , " who now and again dash showily into the biographical lists are careless , lazy and shallow about their research , whereas most of the honest and competent researchists ca n't write for sour apples . " <P> Except for its duller opening chapters , covering Jackson 's brief retirement at the age of 55 , Andrew Jackson : Portrait of a President matches the calibre of the first volume . Once Andrew Jackson is launched on the campaign that made him seventh U. S. President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translated into politics " Old Hickory 's " roaring virtues as an Indian and British fighter , frontier gallant , gambler , duelist . Apart from its fresh portraiture of Jackson , the book offers a well-lighted view of the background events which provided the dress rehearsal for the Civil War . <P> A long book ( 627 pages ) , Andrew Jackson clips along because its subject had more surprises up his sleeve than other Presidents . Highly unpleasant surprises to many a contemporary , they were nevertheless marked by one characteristic on which all could agree : Jackson 's luck . Author James makes hay with the evidence : Jackson 's two landslide elections in the face of some of the most savage mud-slinging in U. S. politics ; his lucky solution of the four-year Government crisis precipitated by his defense of the notorious black-eyed Peggy Eaton ; his strong-armed solution to the problem of South Carolina 's attempted secession ; collection of a long-outstanding debt of 25 million francs from France by the simple device of threatening to dispatch warships ; his ungloved fight to overthrow the Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houston in the fight to annex Texas ( " about which , " says Author James , " the less said by Jackson partisans the better " ) . <P> Retiring as the only President ever to leave office more popular than when he came in , Old Hickory spent his last eight years trying vainly to pay off the fancy debts piled up by his adopted son Andrew Jr . ( one of eleven or more raised and educated by the Jacksons ) . On his deathbed , calling for his spectacles in an effort to make out the stricken faces around him , the old man whispered staunchly : " I hope and trust to meet you all in Heaven , both white and black . . . . " But he gave no sign that he repented of having said , not long before , that he only regretted he had not been able to shoot Henry Clay and hang John C. Calhoun.
