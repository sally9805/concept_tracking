mark  --  " What 's happened to our house , Scott ? " June Lansing 's had been thoughtful and searching . Daniel 's expression had been that of a man so weary he no longer cared much . In Barney 's eyes Scott read the greatest trouble . Grief had left them a trifle wild and a trifle brooding . They were not the eyes of a sane man . He had been the only one who had looked at Munson and not seen him . Barney was turning in , trying to puzzle something out , to catch a lost impression or to map out some little plan of his own . " You do n't have to go through all this , Barney , " Munson had told him , placing a kindly but restraining hand on his shoulder . " But I must go in , " Barney had replied , and moved on with lowered head . " I might help you , Scott , " he had tossed back . Munson entered the library and confronted the little group . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I guess we all are . I wo n't keep you long here because we have a harder task ahead . Here , then , is the situation . " He addressed himself to Daniel . " You can have me handle the case , for I have full authority already , or you can entrust yourselves to the usual agents of the law  --  the law which at present I represent . It is for you to decidewhether you prefer me among you or some other equally distasteful person or persons . I f  --  " " Stay here and do your worst , Scott , " interrupted Daniel . " You ca n't help it . In a way you 're doing us all a kindness , even if it hurts . " " Thanks , Dan , " replied Munson . " You always were a sport . " " See here ! " Holt was on his feet , mouthing aggressively . " What 's all this about , anyway ? You do n't know that a crime has been committed . What rightp101have you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying on I 've ever encountered . " " A crime has been committed . " Barney 's voice came startlingly from a corner . " Holt , in some respects , is justified in what he says , " continued Munson calmly . " My methods are somewhat unofficial , but they have a few saving virtues . They are quiet . They are intelligent . They are absolutely uninfluencedby self-interest or any desire to win official recognition . And that means a lot . As to the question of a crime having been committed , I think that most of us present will agree with me when I say a crime has been committed and that that crime , is murder . Anyway , I am already in possession of certain information conclusive enough to convince me . And by the way , Holt "  --  Munson stepped across the room and stood over the lounging figure  --  " may I ask for that key ? " Holt 's face grew white . He sprang to his feet . " You damned spy l ! ' he cried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting , " he said . " We have other things to do . " There was the sound of an automobile stopping at the front entrance . Munson , looking through the window , saw several local constables alighting from a disreputablemachine . Lane Holt , turning round , also saw them . " Would you like to be searched ? " asked Munson . " You see the law is already in operation . " Munson 's manner suddenly changed . He leaned forward and held the man with his eyes , eyes stinging with fury . " Hurry up , " he said in a low voice . " I want that key . " Holt reeled back as if struck by a snake . His expressionregistered both fear and surprise . Was the man confronting him Scott Munson ? God , no . He was a demon  --  hate in the body of man. pIO2 " I 'm waiting . I 'm waiting , " thrilled Munson 's voice . Holt 's fingers fumbled in his watch pocket and withdrewa key which he extended to Munson with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contact with him . When Munson accepted the key it seemed as if every person in the room breathed easier . " And did you get what you were after ? " he inquired sarcastically . " No , " came hoarsely from Molt . " If you had , " went on Munson in an even , venomous voice , " I 'd have got that too . Now , listen , Holt . Even before this investigation has got well under way you 've made yourself liable to arrest for attempted theft . Sit down now and think that over . You called me a spy . Of course I 'm a spy . At present that 's my one occupation , and I hate it . But it does n't take much of a spy to find out what you 've been doing ever since you accepted the hospitality of Daniel and Barney Crewe . " Munson paused and turned to face the others in the room . His eyes seemed to hold everybody in a spell like some bad dream . " I 'm a spy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , in one sense or another , a spy  --  has to be a spy . That 's one reason why I asked all of you here . To me you are all suspects , and as suspects you naturallycome under my espionage . I will play no favorites , nor will I shirk the most unpleasant duty . I ask you not to regard me as your friend any longer , but merely as a man out to get the truth , to exonerate the innocent and to confront the guilty . Quite a speech , is n't it ? " He paused , then hastened on : " Quite a speech , yes , but the situation must be made clear . It must be understood . If the guilty person can beat me , I for one wo n't blame him . Let him do it . I 'd escape the consequences of a murder myself if I could . So , I say , go to it andpI03escape if and when you can . I 'm here to do a mean job that does not appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it , and I 'm going to show no mercy . And to be entirely frank with you all , the only persons in this room who have nothing to hide are Aunt Matty , and young Barney over there . You are all against me and I 'm against you all . But just the same that fact does not prevent me from liking you all and from wishing that things were different . " He paused and turned to Holt . " Sit down ! " he snapped . " I 'll talk to you later . " Then he walked to his former position and half sat on a long table laden with books , magazines , papers , lamps , and ash trays  --  an untidy , comfortable table . Everyone present was amazed at the sudden urbanity of the man . He favored them all with a bland smile . " I beg your pardon , " he said . " I made a mistake when I told you I liked you all . Personally , I never could bear the sight of Lane Holt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will receive , if anything , more careful treatment than anyone else . " He walked over to a window and looked out as if expecting something . Then he once more returned to his former place and looked thoughtfully at each one of the group in turn . " There is a murderer present , " he said quietly , and the effect of that simple statement was horrible , almost beyond endurance . " A murderer , " he repeated as if to himself , " and he may be my friend . Funny . And even if I catch him I shall always regard him as my friend . " Abruptly he ceased speaking and , turning his back on his listeners , idly sorted the magazines on the table . For a full minute the room was submerged in a broodingsilence . Barney , who had been growing gradually more excited throughout the course of Munson 's talk , now began to tremble slightly . Daniel , watching himpI04with solicitous eyes , was about to go to him when he was arrested by the sound of Holt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a murderer is present ? " he demanded . " What proof ? " Without troubling to turn , Munson answered : " That 's my business , Holt . " " No , it is n't , Scott , " came the excited voice of Barney , at the sound of which both Daniel and Munson started forward . " No , it is n't . It 's my business . I know the murderer now . I 've just figured it out . He always hated her . . . he did n't want me to marry her . . . did n't want me to marry Emily-Jane ! There he is ! Look at him ! There is the murderer . " Barney 's voice broke in hysteria and he pointed wildly at Daniel , who stood still with his hands hanginghelplessly beside him . On his face there was an expression of profound sorrow as he said in a low , pleadingvoice , " Barney , kid . Oh , Barney , Barney , Barney . " And Barney laughed crazily , his trembling arm still extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murdered Emily-Jane , " he cried in a loud voice . " Look at him . Look at him . Does n't he look like a murderer ? Ile killed her as sure as God . " And Daniel still stood there like a man crucified , his tired , tragic eyes striving to reach the heart of his brother . It was not what Barney said that mattered , but that his brother for whom he had gone through several cycles of hell with many more to come should have turned on him at this moment  --  that was the final affliction . " Barney , old man , Barney , " his voice called to his brother . " Come here , kid . Forget it . Do n't be like that . " No one will ever know whether or not Barney was answering that call when he took two steps forward , then crumpled to the floor. pI05In an instant Daniel had gathered him up in his arms and carried him to a sofa . The pain caused by this action caused him to stagger back against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " He 's already here , " replied Munson . " See , he 's takingcare of Barney . It was only a nervous outburst , Daniel . Do n't mind that . He knows you 're his best friend . " He led Daniel to the pantry and made him sit down . Then he handed him a drink . Leaving him for a moment , he returned with Manning . " My God , Dan , " said the doctor , " you should n't have lifted your brother like that . Here , let me look at that arm . " Then , carrying on a rapid-fire conversation , he dressed and bandaged Daniel 's arm , after which he took a drink himself and gave one to his patient . Daniel , feeling his strength returning , followed Manningback to the library where Munson still held the group together . Barney , revived , had gone to his room under the care of Aunt Matty . " Does he still believe ? " Daniel asked as Scott Munsonjoined them . " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must n't mind him . All sensitive , high-strung temperamentsare like that when overwrought . " " Then you 're not going to arrest me ? " asked Daniel , with a broken grin . " Not on that kind of evidence , Dan , " replied Munson . " Barney 's ravings are not relevant . " He looked Daniel squarely in the face and said : " We are all goingto the rocks now . Are you strong enough to come ? I had to talk myself hoarse this morning , waiting for that damn fool Manning . Of course we could have moved her before , but I 've blocked off the entire point from cliff top to the beach . It 's essential that I should see things for myself . Would you like to see her ? " It was a challenge that Daniel feared not to accept . Back down to the beach again . Daniel recalled all the terrors of only a few short hours ago . This time he was accompanied by nearly all of the actors in the drama . Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have stood that . Those stretcherbearers , two stalwart fishermen , they were to bring Emily-Jane home . And he must look at her in full daylightunder the watchful eye of Munson . Was that why they all were there ? Munson , the torturer , always got his way . Well , he , Daniel , would fool him this time . He had used up all his emotions of any kind . He was as dead as Emily-Jane so far as caring was concerned . He was walking with Manning now , and the doctor was helping him along . " Munson 's a brute , " said Manning . " You should never have ( lone this . " Daniel began to laugh . " Done what , doctor ? " he demanded . He knew the doctor was looking at him curiously , and he pulled himself together . They had reached the rocks now . Munson was carefullyshepherding them . Something to do with footprints , perhaps , or perhaps not . Somehow , June was on his other side . She was holding tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't laugh . For God 's sake , do n't laugh . " I did that . " Should he shout it ? Yes , there was Emily-Jane . A little figure on a large rock . He knew what she looked like . He had made her so for this public exhibition . Hold tight , June . " Jesus , " muttered Manning behind them , " does n't she look lonely ? " P107ONCE more Emily-Jane was the center of all eyes . It almost seemed a pity that she could n't have arisen in her ballet dress and performed one of her innocentlysuggestive little dances . Instead she lay there cold , picked out by an early sun as golden as her hair . As in life so in death , eyes looked at her fascinated , but this time there was a different quality in her spell . Munson mounted the rock . For some minutes he stood looking down at the girl . Dark , lithe , and inscrutablehe was . The sun splashed against his straight black hair . He stood motionless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate surroundings . Then , throwing back his head , he let his eyes travel slowly up the face of the cliff until they rested on the summit . There they remained fixed . He would have to go up there to the actual point of the departureof Emily-Jane from the world she had so successfullydeceived . Once more he looked down at the dead girl as if trying to discover the reason for her existence . " All right , Manning , " he said , in a low voice that carried its calm tones clearly to the silent group of watchers . Dr. Manning left Daniel 's side and joined Munson on the rock . " Manning , " Munson said , " I waited for you so that you could give evidence at the inquest . I can rely on your discretion when you are discreet , and I might as well tell you now that I want the inquest to be a mereP108formality  --  wilful murder with an open field . You understand ? " He raised his dark eyes to those of the doctor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What a figure . Too bad . Too damn bad . Wasted . Lost . I understand . " The whole-hearted depravity of the man pleased Munson , who smiled grimly and said , " For the moment , Manning , I want your purely professional observations . " " You have them , Munson . What is it ? " " The position of that figure and certain other details , " Munson continued , " tell me an interesting story . What do they tell you , Manning ? " For some time Manning 's eyes roved over the body , then he looked up at Munson with puzzled eyes . " In the first place , Munson , " he said , " there 's the position of the body itself . Graceful as she was in life , she just could n't have fallen so gracefully . Impossible . She would have been all sprawled out or twisted . Somebodyhas fixed her . Decent of whoever it was . Then another thing , those blood smears on her face , they upsetme . By rights they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is uninjured . There is no reason  --  no way that I can see , for blood being there at all . My conclusionis that someone put those marks on her face . . in the dark . Probably it is n't her blood , but that of some wounded  --  " He gave a slight start and ended up with , " That 's the way I see it . " " Thanks , " said Munson . " Damned good . And that 's the story I want you to tell at the inquest with the exception , with the very essential exception , of the wounded part . Now just one minute and we 'll get this over . I want to let these people go back home to breakfast , if they can eat any . " P109Once more his eyes traveled over the little group at the foot of the rock . " Pete , " he called in a casual voice , " will you come up here for a moment ? " For the second time that morning Pete ascended the rock , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultant . " Now , Pete , " said Munson , with an indulgent smile , " you arrived at the Crewe house at six o'clock . " " Did I ? " said Pete , quite pleased and surprised . " Yes , Pete , you did , " Munson assured him . " Abouthow long were you on this beach altogether ? " " About an hour by the sun , " replied Pete . " What I mean is , one hour from the time I landed until I called on Mr. Barney . " " So that puts you here just at about five o'clock , " observed Munson . " Was the body when you found it exactly as it is now ? " " Exactly , ' replied Pete emphatically . " Just as she lays there now . " " Not likely that anyone else would be wandering round here before five , do you think , Manning ? " asked Munson . " Most unlikely , I should say , " he replied . " That 's all , " said Munson briskly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow . " As Pete was on his way down , Munson called him back . " Did you see anything else down here , " he asked , " that might be helpful in clearing up this case ? Any marks or objects  --  anything ? " And Pete honestly declared that he had not seen a thing , for he had completely forgotten the bright little object now resting in his pocket . Alone on the rock , Munson knelt down and examined the girl 's dress . Suddenly he rose and called to June Lansing . Reluctantly she left Daniel 's side and mounted the rock . " June , " said Munson , still preoccupied , " would you very much mind reaching your hand down in there and see what it is ? I do n't like to do it myself for some reason . " " You 're a terrible man , Scott , " replied June , " and I mean it , but you ca n't help some of your finer instincts , can you ? " When she looked into his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was sadness in his voice , too , when he said : " June , you must believe me . This is the rottenest , the most heartbreaking task I 've ever undertaken . But , June , I 've got to go through with it to the end , and I must ( 10 it my way . " Without another word , June did as she was bidden . The hand she withdrew held a packet of letters . She exchanged glances with Munson , and for the first time June 's eyes wavered . Silently and with a heavy heart she left the rock . When Munson rose and read with deep concentration one of the letters from the packet , Sam could not repress a gasp . " What is it ? " asked Sue , startled . " Oh , nothing , " replied Sam , when all the time he felt like ducking and setting off hell-bent down the beach . " Nothing at all except that this place is getting on my nerves . " He braced himself to receive the admonitory look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completionof the beastly letter . Fortunately for the state of Sam 's morale , no such look was forthcomng . Instead , Munson looked up thoughtfully , then slipped the letter back into the packet . There was a new expression in his eyes when he glanced down at the still figure at his feet.  | " Holt , " he called sharply . As Holt approached the rock it became apparent to everyone present that he was in an abject state of funk . His swagger and self-esteem were gone , and with their departure the man became a lamentably deflated creature . His feet seemed to scrape along the rocks and his eyes strained away from the body of Emily-Jane . Munson watched him silently . " Go on and look at her , " he said harshly . " You were n't so modest when she was alive . " Lane Holt for a swift flash bared his teeth , then he looked uneasily away , his fingers nervously plucking at the flaps of his coat pockets . Munson seemed to be in no hurry . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waxen face turned to the sky . " What the hell do you want with me here ? " Holt asked at last in a husky voice . " Oh , yes , ' Lreplied Munson . " Thanks for reminding me . Were these , by any chance , what you were looking for in Emily-Jane 's room ? " He held out the packet of letters . Holt started visibly . Involuntarily his hand went out as if to seize the packet . " Oh , no , no , " he replied . " I was looking for nothing  --  just to see if she was in , that 's all . " " No thought of a little blackmail , Holt ? " asked Munson . " Sort of a complete life of crime ? No ? " " I did n't do it , Munson . I did n't , you know . I  --  I was fond of Emily-Jane . I really was . " " That admission makes it all the more probable in view of the fact that she was soon to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holt . You do n't have to . " " May I go now ? " Holt 's face was ghastly , his wordsp112trembled . He could feel Munson 's eyes burning into him . There was no escape . No hope of escape . " Yes , go ! " The words fell like a lash . Munson turned back to his inspection of the blood smears . " Dan , " he called in an absorbed voice , " do you think you could make the grade , old man ? " " Damn him and his old mans , " muttered Sam . " He 's trying to hang the lot of us . Why , old Dan can hardly stand on his feet . He 's been through enough for oneday . " But Daniel was moving forward , moving slowly and carefully , but well under way . There was no suggestion of hesitancy about his approach , no indication of guilt or dread . At the base of the rock , Pete Clark , who had remained to see whatever was to be seen , offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Dan . " I think I can still navigate . " He climbed the rock he had played on so often as a boy , and stood gazing down at Emily- , Jane . Not many hours ago she had been dancing and trysting . Enjoyingboth . It seemed such a great way off . Just a few hours . Most of the guests at the affair were still sleeping . Time had not even begun for them . How could she be so utterly dead , so completely remote from life ? Why , she did not even know that life ever had been , that there was a world with golf links in it , country clubs , and dances . She was not even aware of the rock she was lying on . She was through , gone . And really it was a good thing , although even in death she still retainedthe power to wound and to destroy . What a fool he had been to hope otherwise . Munson had been repeatinghis name for some time . Why in hell could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , yes , " he said impatiently . " What 's on yourp113mind , Scott ? " His gaze was polite but abstracted . Scott was a good chap . A hard worker . At present , an awful pest . " What do you make of these , Dan ? " asked the awful pest , pointing to the blood smears on the face of EmilyJane . " I asked Doc Manning , but I 'd like to get your opinion . " Daniel 's thoughts snapped back to the immediate present . " Are we conversing as equals , Scott ? " he asked . " As always , Dan , " replied Munson , a little puzzled . " That being the case , " said Dan , with a smile , " my opinion is that you 're an extremely apparent hypocrite and that you do n't want my opinion at all . Scott , old dear , you 're just plain plain , if you get what I mean . Now let 's get down to cases . What do you really want ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? Are you seeking my collaboration ? If so , give me your confidences also . As you know , I 'm a pretty sick dog at present . You ca n't bank on my reactions , you know , because I 'm not quite myself at the moment . Out with it , Scott . Do n't be a humbug . " " Daniel , " said Munson , " you 're too much for me . As far as I 'm concerned , your rather painful trip down here has been entirely wasted . I see now that I 'll have to work on you a different way . You know me too well . I 'm at a disadvantage because of that , but time will tell . Good luck . I hope you win . " " Same to you , " said Daniel . " I hope you choke . " " Thanks , " replied Munson with a real smile . " Can I help you down ? " " No , thanks , " said Daniel . " I think I can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Scott ? She 's licked . " " But do n't forget , Dan , she still possesses the power of death . " Daniel turned and faced him squarely . " You mean you possess the power of death , " he retorted . " She 's ended . " Thus , at the moment of triumph , Daniel made the mistake of emphasizing with obvious satisfaction the impotency of Emily-Jane . Munson was not the man to overlook such little slips . He dropped the sheet over the body and followed Daniel from the rock . " We 've stood about enough punishment for one morning , " he said to the little group . " You 'd better get back now and try to eat something . When we bring home Emily-Jane , I hope you 'll keep young Barney out of the way . Do n't mind the presence of some minions of the law if you happen to see them . I 've had to have a few photographs taken , but I 've instructed the men to leave the members of the household entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll join you as soon as I can , if that prospect brings you any pleasure . I hope , Dan , young Barney has come to his senses , hut do n't be surprised if he develops a fixed idea . It will have to wear itself out . It 's tough , but the kid 's had a shock . " He paused and looked down the beach . " At last , " he exclaimed , " here comes our honored coroner . I bet he 's had his breakfast . " Munson was back on the rock when they last saw him . With the assistance of a short stout officer he was carefully painting the outline of Emily-Jane upon the rock . Having settled his business with the coroner and that dignitary having departed , Munson turned to the two local officers who had come to relieve Griggs , the gardener . One of these officers was a red man . That was the impression he gave . Red of face and hair and hand . Hep115was short and rather stout . The other was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken sort of face , and great lengths of arms and legs  --  yards of them . " Well , " thought Munson , considering the pair , " this is a well-balanced team they 've given me . " " What 's your name ? " he asked the little red officer . " Shay , sir , " came the piping reply . " And yours ? " Scott turned to the other , whose sad eyes were fixed dreamily on the sea . " Shay , sir , " this one found the heart to say . " I 'm not asking to be introduced to my friend here , " said Munson . " I already know his name . " The crushed officer looked even more sorrowful . " My name is Shay , " he replied , as if trying to convince himself of that fact . " Oh , " suggested Scott hopefully . " Brothers , I take it . " " We hardly know each other , " protested the crushed one . " He 's .. just joined . Been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new complication , Munson came near to washing his hands of the case , but he rallied gamely . " What do they call you at home ? " he asked the red officer . " Tim , sir , " came the prompt reply . The crushed man seemed to be having a terrible time with himself . He gave the impression of one preparing for a long , swift flight . When Munson turned to him he spoke quickly . " Do n't ask it , Mr. Munson , " he said . " It is . It always was . " They were now standing in a space where no one had been allowed to tread . The two fishermen were preparing to carry the body back to the house . Munson sat down on a rock and moodily considered the situa/tion . Suddenly his eyes took on a new interest . About two feet away , in a patch of smooth hard sand , was an odd impression  --  a cluster of small pointed indentations , the whole being a little larger than a fifty cent piece . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tim Shays , he took out a notebook and made a careful sketch of the design . While doing so he noticed the mark of a man 's foot near by . This he carefullymeasured for length and breadth . Then he put away his notebook and turned to face the situation . " Well , " he said , " I 'm not blaming you fellows about the matter of names , but it does seem unfortunate . Any suggestions ? " " I 've also been known as Shad , " offered the crushed man . " And they used to call me Red , " contributed the other . " Red Shay , " he added , with evident satisfaction . Munson beamed upon them . " Well , " he said , " you can see for yourself how simple it is . It 's all settled . Now , boys , we 'll have to get up the face of that cliff somehow or other . " His aids looked aghast . The man must be mad . If he started in like this , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been vouchsafed them , they would have resigned en masse from the force . Munson was back on the rock , superintending the removal of Emily-Jane , taking an active part in it . " Careful , men , " he told the huskies . " She 's badly broken . Handle her gently . " And the great men , with hard , rough hands , handled the body of Emily-Jane with all the delicacy of a woman . Munson stood looking after them as they plodded through the sand , bringing Emily-Jane home . Then he rejoined his waiting staff.  | " All set , " he said briskly , and led the way to the path that twisted tip the side of High Point Rock . At the foot of the path the staff halted smartly . " They say I suffer from giddiness , " confided Red to Munson . " Well , here 's your chance to show them they 're all wrong , " replied Munson . " Mr. Munson , " quoth Shad , " I 'm a good man on a flat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so good . " Munson suddenly turned on them with what they later decided was nothing less than the fires of hell in his eyes . " Do you see this path ? " he asked them in a low voice . " Do you see how steep it is  --  how high ? " They readily agreed that they saw all that and more . " Well , if this path were ten miles long , " continued Scott , " and twice as high , I 'd make you sprint up it . Come on . " As they fell in behind him , Red confided to Shad in a whisper , " There 'll be two deaths instead of one . " " Three , " muttered Shad . " And he 'll be the murderer . " As Munson made his way up the twisting pathway , he halted from time to time.to chalk a circle round certaindark stains that occasionally appeared on the large rocks beside the way . He noted that the rocks bearing these stains were always those that would prove helpful in serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took . no pride in his discoveries . In fact they rather depressed him . Those blood smears on the face of Emily-Jane and a few dark spots on the rock had led him to expect the existence of these on the path . Once he stopped and picked from between two rocks , companionably leaning against each other , a torn piece of blood-stained lint , obviously a part of a bandage- Daniel 's bandage . The train was only too clear , yet it did not prove that Daniel had murdered Emily-Jane . Contributory evidence only . He might have been on the spot . He might have gone down the cliff after the commissionof the act , and arranged her body . He might have seen the person who did kill her , but so far , Munsonsuddenly realized , he possessed no conclusive evidence . Daniel had the motive , and it could be proved he was at the scene of the murder , but was that quite enough ? With some juries it would be if the case were properly presented . And then Munson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club just before Daniel had driven off  --  that could be used to advantageby a skilful prosecutor , but still it was not complete . Even now Daniel might be safe if only nothing new were found against him . Munson , poised in the path , with the piece of red lint in his hand , sweated not so much from the exertion of the climb as from the temptation to pervert the truth , to juggle the facts . Not for any too easily possible . It could be done . On the night , or rather morning , of Emily-Jane 's death there was more than one person astir , and probably lurking round High Point Rock . He wiped his forehead and , after slipping the lint into an envelope , continued on his way . Clawing up the path behind him , came the two exhaustedShays . When they spied the chalk marks on the rocks they became exceedingly perplexed . " Looks to me like he 's playing games , " observed Red , quite seriously . " He 's just mad enough to , " returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way . " " That 's real nice of him then , " put in Red in hisp119best sarcastic pipe . " As if there was a chance of ever losing this path . It would be just as hard to go back now as to keep on going up . " " Then up we go , " groaned Shad . " This is n't getting us nowhere . " " No ? " said Red . " Well , I 'm telling you now , I 'm scratching out my grave with my own two dogs . " Munson was met at the top of the path by a tall bronzed man with startlingly pale blue eyes . He was neat of appearance , well set up , and had a brisk , businesslikeway about him . " Are you Mr. Munson ? " he asked . " I was before I started up that damned path , " said Scott , with a faint smile . " I 'm rather less than Munson now . And you ? " The bronzed man with the pale blue eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name 's Bennett , Mr. Munson , " he said . " I 'm from headquarters . The district attorney instructed me to hot-foot it down here to help you . Now get me right on this . He told me to help you when and if you needed me , but not to butt into your operations . In other words , I 'm at your disposal . I can come and go as needed . I 've been here since a quarter to seven . Found two local men guarding the point . I 've been standing by up here because from all I could learn , it seemed to me that this place was important . " Munson extended his hand . " I need someone like you , " he said . " Already I 've felt the need of someone with whom to compare notes  --  someone to talk to  --  someone to listen to me . This is a family affair , you know , and that makes things difficult . " He paused to consider his words carefully , then added : " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not through lack of trust , but merely on thep120grounds of expediency . Unnecessary things need not be known . " " I expect nothing , Mr. Munson , " said Bennett . " I 'm really not on the case . As I said before , I 'm merely standing by to be used when called for . . . to go here and there when necessary . " At this moment two strained faces appeared round the edge of the rock at the head of the path . The faces were too tired even to sweat . They had merely congealedthemselves into two molds of exhaustion . It looked as if for all eternity , even after eons of complete rest those faces would remain unchanged , never able to return to their former state of well-being . Bodies followed the faces , and these bodies promptly deposited themselves on the ground . " Quite a climb , " came from one of the faces , with a feeble smile . " Compared with that path , Mt . Blanc is a hole in the ground , " announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pointing to the prostrate figures . Then he addressed himself to the faces . " Rest up , boys , " he said . " You deserve it . Rest up a few minutes , then we 'll get to work . Be careful where you walk . " " Ca n't walk , " said the redder face . " Do n't have to worry where I put my feet , " said the other . " Mine stay right where they are . . . forever . " As the two men walked away , Munson 's keen ear detectedthe sound of low but hysterical laughter . Munson , himself , was laughing a little inwardly . " I feel sure I 'll be needing your help , " he remarked to Bennett . " My staff seems to be permanently damaged . Have you looked about any ? " " A little , " replied Bennett , " but touched nothing . There are certain things . " He did not continue. pI2I " Yes , " said Munson , taking a quick step forward and pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to High Point Rock , " and I 'll bet one of those certain things is the property of that gesticulating gentleman . " " There is a silver hip flask , " suggested Bennett . " Lead me to it , " said Munson . " I have an idea I know about where it is . " " We must step carefully because there are also footmarks , " observed Bennett diffidently . Fifteen yards farther on , close to the soggy edge of the great rock , Bennett pointed to a flask lying on the bare earth . Round about the flask was a frantic scramble of footprints now rapidly drying beneath the sun that had promised so much . Munson carefully picked up the flask and examined it for initials . They were plain enough  --  " L. H. " A pleased expression came to Munson 's face . Suddenly he waved the flask aloft . " It 's all right , Holt , " he called . " I 've found it . " With an expression of the utmost dismay , Holt stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flask , gleaming like an accusing brand in the sunlight . " Will you please go , Bennett , " said Munson , " and conduct that gentleman through our conscientious con-stabulary ? " Bennett soon returned with Holt in tow . " Be careful how you step , Holt , " warned Munson . " You might spoil some of your own footprints . By the way , which ones are yours ? " Munson looked appraisingly at Holt 's feet , then pointed to a mark in the soil . " I 'll bet that one belongs to you , " he said . " Of course , you were wearing dancing shoes . Put your foot in it and see how it fits . "  | " Damned if I will , " replied Holt , his eyes on the flask . " And you have n't the authority to make me . " " You 're right there , " replied Munson , reluctantly . " Anyway , I do n't work much from footprints unless they are practically forced upon me . Nevertheless your refusal shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is this yours ? " Holt 's hand shot out to the extended flask , which Munson quickly drew back . " I see it is , " he remarked dryly . " We found it here  --  right on the edge of the cliff at virtually the exact spot where Emily-Jane was pushed to her death . " " Munson , I swear to God I did n't do it , " said Holt in desperation . " In spite of that flask , in spite of everything you 've got against me or may get against me , I tell you I did n't murder Emily-Jane . " " All right , Holt , " said Munson , in a voice a little less bitter than he customarily used when addressing him . " Go away now and do n't cone back here . We 'll have a little talk soon . But keep your shirt on . You 're in a bad way . " The man 's once jaunty shoulders sagged as he turned and retraced his steps . Munson looked after ' him for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The trouble with this case , " he said , " lies in the extraordinary circumstance that I have already three perfectly good suspects , three perfectly good motives , and three convincing sets of clues . Get me ? " Bennett nodded . " If I worked hard enough , " continued Scott , " I might be able to convict any one of the three suspects , yet all three ca n't be guilty . " " It 's a matter of choice at present , " remarked Bennett.  | " That 's just the trouble , " replied Munson . " It 's a matter of choice  --  my own personal feelings , and I do n't like that . If I followed them I 'd go out and get that person who was just here , a most unpalatable character . " " Why do n't you do it ? " asked Bennett . " No , " said Munson , with a shake of his head , " that would be a little too low down . I may get him in the end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me he 's not the man . " He rose and walked restlessly about , his searching eyes taking in every detail of the setting . He noted the bushes , stopped to examine certain marks barely visible in the soil , then returned to the cliff 's edge and stood looking clown at the confused grouping of footprints . The minutes passed unnoticed as he examined these . At length he returned to the rock and sat down . " Had much experience with murder ? " he asked suddenly . " Some , " said Bennett . " Any good on observation ? " continued Munson . " Yes , I am , " replied the other quite frankly . " I 've a microscopic pair of eyes , and that 's almost a fact . " " Good , " said Munson . " Now I 'm going to make up a little story and after I 've finished I want you to help me find out if there 's any foundation in fact in it . " He closed his eyes and settled himself on the rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " and I 'm getting damned hungry and sleepy . Ca n't afford to be sleepy . Well , here goes . A girl and a man are standing right here near the edge of the cliff . It is three o'clock in the morning . An old slut of a moon is trying to display her vanished beauty . The man and the girl are drinking , perhaps . In those bushes over there a man is hiding . He watches and listens . And somewhere about , not quite sure where , another man is hiding . Now one of two things happens . I do n't know which . Either the couple near the edge of the cliff starts to quarrel , and the man tries and eventually succeeds in pushing her over in spite of the intervention of one of the hidden men , either that happens or the couple starts in lovemakingand one of the hidden men rushes out and confrontsthem . A fight follows and over she goes . In either case the second hidden man is a witness to the whole tragic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared momentarily dumb . " Munson stopped and opened his eyes . " Now you study these marks here , wander round through the bushes and examine the ground as well as you can under the circumstances , then tell me what you 've found out . I 'm either too lazy or too tired to do it myself , but already I 've seen some things . " Bennett , without a word and with a display of modesty that did him credit , followed the trail of Munson'sprevious investigations , only he was much more thorough and fared farther afield . Ile even disappeared into the thicket of bushes . When he returned he set about reading the riddle of the footprints . Munson seemed to be sleeping or thinking . Bennett was not sure which . Finally he spoke . " Mr. Munson , " he said , " you 're about right , but it wo n't work unless we can get that eye-witness of yours to come clean . " " Oh , I know it 's only a story , " replied Munson . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's all . " " What actually did happen , I expect , " said Bennett . " Let 's work backwards . " " A good idea , " agreed Munson . " Well , let 's begin with this mess of footprints , " went on the other . " Undoubtedly these are the girl's.  |p125High  heels and all . A small , dainty foot . Now , there are two pairs of men 's prints , one larger than the other . All that they actually show is that there 's been considerablestamping going on . There 's your scuffle part . But there 's one print that gives us our lead to the bushes , assuming the guy ran in a straight line . Take the last print in  --  the one on the outskirts , so to speak . Feel like moving ? " " No , " replied Munson , " but I will . " " Then , we 'll use the center of that heel as a pointer and follow it to the bushes , " said Bennett . The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bushes . It hardly required a practiced eye to see that someone had recently broken through those bushes . The interlaced twigs were snapped in several places . Some leaves had been stripped from the branches . With the facts already in hand it was not difficult to reconstruct the scene . " Want to go inside ? " Munson did . Here they discovered ample evidence to confirm whatever suspicion the snapped twigs and stripped leaves might have aroused . A large body must have crouched here . There were not many signs of trampling , but enough to show that the thicket at this point was unlike the thicket elsewhere . Not conclusive , perhaps , but sufficiently so under the circumstances . " Satisfied ? " asked Bennett . Munson nodded . " Then let 's go back , " said the detective . They retraced their steps and followed the bushes round a bend . Bennett stopped and pointed . " In there , " he said briefly . " Same thing . " " I had n't found that one , " said Munson . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't worked into your story . It might have a bearing . " This time Bennett took Munson to an isolated clumpp126of bushes about fifteen yards from the edge of the cliff . The dump was composed of unusually high bushes . A tall person could stand beneath their branches . Even with the sun doing its best , the soil underneath the bushes remained moist . Bennett took no little pleasure in pointing out to Munson the prints of two different pairs of feet on the landward side of the clump . One pair was made by a man , the other by a woman , but the woman could not have been Emily-Jane , for these prints had been made by far less dainty shoes of an entirely different character . " I wonder who they were , " mused Munson aloud . " Of course they might have been here earlier in the evening and then gone away , " said Bennett , dashing cold water all over his discovery . " I know , I know , " replied Munson impatiently . " But in a case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead as hot as this might prove extremely helpful . . . . Not every witness of a murder is willing to come forward . It was a hot , murky , dark summer night . God knows how many couples were taking advantage of it to go the limit . You could n't drag ' em to admit they were out in the dark , dark bushes at three o'clock in the morning . A woman would have to be fairly seething with public spirit and pro bono publico to come forward of her own free will , and , of course , the escort would hold back for fear of involving the woman . " He stopped speaking and looked thoughtfully at the prints , particularly at those of the woman . He seemed to be trying to visualize the person who had stood in the shoes that had left their marks so clearly behind . " Bennett , " he said at last , " a man spends all his life taking back something whether he knows it or not . I now take back what I said awhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past I 've never got all worked up over them , but these prints here interest me strangely . They might mean so damn much  --  not the prints , but the persons who made them . Now , as I read these prints  --  I refer to the smaller ones  --  it strikes me they must have been made either by a woman who preferscomfort to style or by one who has occasion to be much on her feet , a servant perhaps . I do n't mean one of your high-stepping , high-heeled , movie-mad girls , although she may easily be that type  --  Wait a minute . " Munson broke off , and returned to his inspection of the prints . " Let 's take up the man 's prints for a change , " he resumed . " What type of man left them here , do you suppose ? " Bennett studied the marks in the damp soil for severalminutes . He , too , seemed to be endeavoring to give flesh and blood to the wearer of the shoes that had made them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was far from being a dandy . The wide , flat heel and the broad toe , the nail marks in the heel and the full impression of the sole , all go to convince me that those are the working shoes of a working-man  --  an outside man . " He looked at Munsonfor confirmation , but Munson seemed to be miles away . " All right , " said Munson unexpectedly . " How about this : A maid still wearing her service shoes snags onto the stable man , the gardener , or some other outside male servant , and takes him for a walk . No date , no dressingupfor the occasion , no thought one way or another . They come down here and eventually stand behind this bush . Now , I say this because I happen to know just such a likely pair . There may be a dozen of them on this point of land  --  all sorts of combinations of those pairs , but I know one pair . I 've watched them . A maid and an outside boy who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down here on a dark night . Perfectly innocently , I mean , that is , within all reasonable expectations . I 'm going to find out  --  Oh , hell , " he broke off , " all this is unprofitable speculation , but interesting . You got me into it , Bennett . I already know the murderer . Of that I 'm fairly certain , but I wish to God I could find another one . I rather like this murderer , you see . Understand , Bennett , my remarks are unofficial now . " " Perfectly , Mr. Munson , " replied Bennett earnestly . " It 's a tough situation . " " It is . It is , " said Munson , walking absent-mindedly away . Presently he stopped and called back over his shoulder , " Have you had any breakfast , Bennett ? " " I could stand a cup of coffee , " he replied . " Then let 's go back to the house . There are things to be done there and I 'd like to have you along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to leave the point . " What 's to become of us ? " asked the piping voice . Munson looked upon the intrepid Shays with a sardonicgrin . " My staff seems to be partially resuscitated , " he said . " What 's going to become of you , did you ask ? " " Yes , Mr. Munson , " said Shad . " What 's to become of us ? " " One hell of a lot , " came the distressing reply , " if you stick around with me . Come along and I 'll show you .  | Care Sits on Crewe HouseWHEN Daniel and the rest returned from the beach , Manning , who had returned a little beforethe others , was waiting on the veranda . " A nice , depressing morning , " he said in greeting . " Just the sort of a thing for a bright summer day . Invigoratesthe body and stimulates the nerves . Gives one an appetite . " He was talking at random now , popping out anything in an endeavor to make these sad-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various vices was a genuine desire to see his friends happy , to open a bottle of any old thing and to help them to enjoy life . He was constantly fighting off the dread of depression . No one suspected how low-spirited he felt when alone at night he confronted himself in the mirror and thought , " Only a few more years left now and those not much good . " For this reason he made it a point to be alone at night as little as possible . In this he succeeded tremendously , but no one realized more keenly than he that within a few short years he would be able to share only his memories with the charming women he had once seduced . Therefore , when he saw the party from the beach come trailing across the lawn , he , too , felt as if the bottom had dropped out of things . Getting drunk , he reflected , was no worse than getting morbid . The only trouble about it was you could n't stay drunk indefinitely . And as soon as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick . He voiced his thoughts tentatively.  | " I think we should all get just a little bit drunk , " he suggested . " And play going to Jerusalem , " added June . " Or murderer , murderer , who 's got the murderer , " put in Sam bitterly . " No , " protested Daniel , " Scott is playing that game , and it looks as if he 's going to win . How 's Barney , doctor ? " " Barney 's all right , " replied Manning . " I 've seen the best-hearted people break out like that before . When they 've had a shock they turn on those closest to them . Do n't worry , Dan . Something will come along and shock him back to reason . " He led June aside and looked at her seriously and with kindly comprehension . " Listen , June , " he said in a low voice . " I want you to know that I 'm with the house in this affair . You know what I mean . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that matter . A friend on the outside may prove very valuable in the near future . I 'm that friend , and I want you to consider me so . Might not be so damned respectable , but I 've still got a lot of influenceround these parts with all kinds of people . They 'll do things for me . That 's all . You can count on me . Now I 'm going to take charge of Daniel and put him to bed for a while . Send up some coffee and toast and "  --  he considered a moment , then continued  --  " yes , you 'd better send up a bottle of well-selected wine . I 've got to put some heart into Daniel . This thing is going to be a fight , June , and it 's only just begun . " " It began a long time ago , Dr. Manning , " said June . " I 'm afraid that this is the last act where everybody gets carried off the stage on stretchers and things . But it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps telling me we 're not licked yet . If I thought so "  --   |p131she  shrugged her shoulders  --  " I 'd put an end to the misery . " " How ? " asked Manning . " I do n't know right off , but I 'd find a way . " " Do you think he did it , that chap , Holt ? " June followed the direction of the doctor 's glance to an isolated corner of the veranda where Holt was sittingalone . Within the past few hours the man had altered shockingly . There was a crazy cast to his face . His eyes were all confused with conflicting emotions , hate and fear fighting for supremacy . June could find in her heart no pity for Lane Holt . " I wish he had , " she answered . " I wish he had . " " He damn well looks the part , " said Manning . " If he goes round like that much longer he 'll be slipping the noose over his own head . Come along , June . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the veranda and joined the group . I Lo one appeared to be interested in breakfast , yet no one could hit on anything better to do . Before Daniel left with the doctor , he turned to his friends . " We should get this straight , I think , " he said . " Munson is not to blame . He did everything in his power to head off what has happened . I know that . Now he must go his way and we ours . I still consider him my friend , and you must admit that as a friend Scott Munson is , to say the least , a good egg . " " And as an enemy he 's a pain in the neck , " said Sam doggedly . " An unhappy selection of words to express your sentiments , Sam . " Daniel grinned at his friend from the doorway . Sam looked back at Daniel and realized with a stab of impotent anger what a human wreck he was as he stood there grinning , or trying to grin . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears from starting to his eyes . " Oh , hell , " he replied a little huskily , " what do words matter any more ? What do they mean ? I feel like Manning . Let 's all get a little drunk , and laugh a lot at nothing . " " Or cry a lot for something , " surprisingly remarked Sue , who had never placed much confidence in her tongue . One by one they drifted into the cheerful old diningroom , but Holt remained alone on the veranda . He was brooding , scheming , and fighting down his fear . Why could n't he tell ? Munson would n't believe him . No one would believe him , yet , by God , Daniel was guilty as hell . Holt had not seen his face , but there was no mistaking his figure , particularly that blood-wet hand . His fear was gaining ascendency now . All the world was fear . Everything was against him . Everyone . Hopelessly he slumped forward in his chair . His thoughts were like the haze on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Manning had finished with Daniel 's arm and got him into bed , he leaned back in an easy chair and sipped his wine with pagan appreciation . " Ah , Daniel , my boy , " he said , " if we were only in Biarritz or Paris . I often think of those places . " " Somehow I 'd like to be in Montreux , " came rather wistfully from the bed . " You know , Manning . . . all of us . . . out of this mess . . . Barney better and everything . " A moment 's silence , then , " but that ca n't be . . . ever . " The voice trailed off and finished with a decided , " Damn it all to hell ! "  | " It can be , Daniel . " Manning 's tone was tempting . " Listen , Daniel , it can be . I 'm positive of that . " " How ? " " You know my damn young fool of a nephew , Lambert ? Rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Know him well . He 's all right . " " Glad you think so . Glad somebody thinks so . I like him , myself . Drink up , Daniel . It wo n't hurt you . " Manning was working hard to put a little enthusiasm into his patient . He was waxing enthusiastic himself as his plan took shape in his mind . " Well , " he continued , " young Lambert has a yacht among many other things , a regular sea-going yacht . She 's anchored in a cove near Willow Point . . . not far off . And she 's ready for sea at a moment 's notice . Remember that . It 's a good point . Now , this damn fool nephew of mine has been just aching to take a trip round the world or to any spot betweenor thereon . All he 's waiting for is someone to go with him . Does n't care how many . It could be done quietly , Daniel , and if this mess , as you call it , keeps on getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There was a knock at the door . " Come in , " called Daniel . " The doctor 's wanted , " one of the maids announced in an awed voice . " They 've brought the body back . " " Oh , damn ! " said Manning , gulping down his wine . " It 's not my job , but anything to be obliging . Think it over , Dan . " The door closed and Daniel lay there alone . . . thinking . He was too damn tired to think . He closed his eyes ... He must have drowsed off , for when he next opened his eyes , June was sitting by his bed . He had not heard her come in nor did he know how long she had been there . Her hand was lying on the coverlet , a strong but now pathetically listless hand , and he let his fall upon it . " Hello , June . " He gave her hand a gentle squeeze . " ' Lo , Daniel . Any better ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's up and about . The poor kid seems to be lost . " " He does n't come to me . " " He 's thinking only of himself at present and of . . her . " " I 'd like to spank his bottom . " " Very pretty . Suppose I died . Would you go round visiting the sick and wounded ? " " If they 'd been good to me , yes . I might get drunk and laugh at nothing . " " Would you mind if I ( lied , Daniel ? " " Quite a lot . Part of me is dead already . Do you want to kill the rest ? " " No . " " Then do n't die . " " But I might have to . " " Same here . I 'm pretty damn close to it now . " " What do you mean ? " " What did you mean ? " Silence . A long silence , then Daniel , " Is she next door ? " " No , Dan . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " " It 's just as well , June . The trouble started with her , but it has n't ended with her . " " Are you glad she 's gone ? " " Yes , glad . " " Then so am I. " " Munson thinks I did it , June . " " Scott thinks everybody did it . " " Sort of a mass attack , eh ? " " Or a series of individual assaults . " " Each pushing her nearer the brink . " DID SHE FALL ? 135 " We should n't talk like this , " said June . " Why not ? You never liked her . " " I never liked her , no . Toward the end I hated her more than anything else in life . I hated her more than the filthiest vice or the most cowardly deed . " " She deserved all that , June . " " But what about God ? " " He would n't have cared for her much . " " Wish it could have happened some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of  --  " " He did kill her , June , if there is a God . He killed her as much as  --  oh , well , anybody . Do n't doubt that . " " You could n't get Scott to see it that way . " " He 'd have a hell of a time catching God . " " He 'd try to if he thought there was a ghost of a chance . " " June ? " " Yes , Dan . " " How 'd you like to go away ? " " How go away ? " " On a yacht , a fine big yacht . All over the world . Everywhere . Away from this mess . Out of reach . New places . A new suit of thoughts . " " God , Dan , I 'd love it . Could I have a new dress of thoughts ? " " Yes , dear , and a hat . " " Everything new from the skin out , Dan . " " That goes with me as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like my skin ? " " The little I 've been able to ogle . " " We 'll like each other a long time , Dan ? " " Let 's do it , June . " " No matter what ? " " No matter what . "  | " And then we 'll go away to everywhere on that yacht , wo n't we ? " " If you 'll slip me a kiss we will . " " All right . I 'm going now . " June bent over Daniel . " Excuse me , can I come in , lady ? " " Great God , June , what 's that ? " A crushed face with desperate eyes was looking in at the window . It seemed to be suspended in space and terribly aware of the fact . " What are you doing there ? " asked June . " Just what are you doing there ? " " Damned if I know , lady , " spoke the face . " Riskinglife and limb , if you ask me , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you ? " " What , me , lady ? Looking ? I 'm just clutching . Hanging on for dear life . " " Well , you ca n't come in . That 's that . Tell Mr. Munsonso . " " Oh , lady , I ca n't get down . Come look how I am all scrunched up and perilous . " " You should have thought about that before you climbed up here . " " I did , lady . That was all I thought of . Could n't think of anything else . " " Well , tell Mr. Munson you ca n't come in . " The face looked earthward cautiously . " Mr. Munson , " it wailed , " she says I ca n't come in . " " Then snap on down , " came the voice of Scott Munson . " Did you hear that , lady ? " asked the face . " Snap on down , ' says he . There 's a fair sample for you . I 'd snap like a twig if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady . " " Let him in , June , " said Daniel . " I 'm interested to see just what is attached to a face like that . "  | " You can come in , " said June . " I 'll always remember this , lady , and you , too , sir , in the bed . I 'll always remember this and be grateful . Could you give me a hand , lady ? It 's more for the sake of confidence . A man just ca n't be courageous in the position I 'm in . It would be foolhardy . " June seized the outstretched hand and gave it a powerful pull . Face , body , and feet came clattering into the room . " Lady , you saved my life , " said Officer Shad as he rose from the floor . " Bring him over here , June ? " From the left knee of the man 's trousers Daniel picked a piece of red lint . Another piece clung to his elbow . " Now an envelope and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the envelope and wrote : Clues foufrd on the body and person of one of your profession . With the compliments of Daniel Crewe . " Take that to Mr. Munson , officer , and call again at any time . " " But not by the tree , sir . Never that tree again . " " This is the way out , " said June . " Where do I go when I leave here , lady ? " " Oh , just go wandering round , barging in anywhere . Some day we 'll find your body rotting in the halls . " Officer Shad slid out with a shiver . " He spoiled a perfectly good kiss , " complained June , returning to the bed.  | Daniel dressed slowly and went downstairs He was wondering what had become of Sam Stoughten . He had n't had a talk with Sam since the thing occurred . He would like to know what Sam was thinking . Munsonhad those letters . As he stepped out on the veranda his eyes fell on Barney , sitting crouched before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvas . He was shocked to attention . A great trembling emptiness took the place of all other emotions . His brother was painting the scene of the crime with the murderer on the spot . So much was apparent at once to the eye although the picture was little more than commenced . There was the Rock caught in a pale unearthly radiance , and caught in the radiance also was the vague , half-formed figure of a man in a black domino with the hood removed . The figure although hardly more than an impression looked tall and gaunt , much like his own . Its arms were upraised frantically , and the face , indistinguishable , was lifted to the hidden source of the light . Daniel lost himself in the weird spirit of this terrible picture . Once more he was standing at the edge of the cliff with the first numbing realization of murder laying cold hands on his heart . He was alone there , sick and afraid . He had done it . He had murdered . He could feel again the flesh of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipping from him , twirling through the night to death . Daniel 's lips began to tremble . Sweat broke from his forehead . He tried to take his eyes from the canvas , but the fascination of horror held them fixed . It was as if he were calling to himself , accusing himself , demonstratinghis deed before the eyes of the world . NothingScott Munson could do or say would have the same uncanny power as had this picture to move him , top139break down his resistance and self-control and finally to cause him to confess his crime . Here was the highestrefinement of torture , conceived by his own brother . So absorbed had Daniel been in the picture that he had not noticed his brother 's curious gaze fixed upon him . Barney had been noting with the insight of an artist every light and shade of emotion that passed across Daniel 's face . He had been studying his brother 's expressions , his open display of dread and horror , with morbidly bitter enjoyment . " I thought you 'd appreciate it , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing it for your special edifica-tion . " Daniel started , came back out of the picture , and looked at his brother . " Do n't , kid , " he said . " It 's not like you . " Barney laughed ironically . " It 's exactly like me . I am like that . " " You never hurt a soul in your life , Barney . before . " " No ? Well , watch me from now on . " Aunt Matty had come out and was standing by Daniel . She was staring at the picture with wide eyes . " Oh , Barney , " she said , at last , " that 's not nice . Why do n't you paint something else  --  a rose or a rainbow ? " " Or a pickle or a sponge or a cabbage , " suggested Barney , with a sneer . " That picture is n't intended to be nice . I prefer to paint murderers . My inspiration stands beside you . " Daniel led Aunt Matty back into the house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old lady , usually so game , was weeping softly . " There , there now , " murmured Daniel , putting an Ann round the frail body . " Barney is n't well yet . He does n't mean what he says . He 'll come back to us . Do n't take on so . " " I do n't know what 's come over this old house , " said Aunt Matty . " It used to be a place of so much sea and sunlight , Danny . Laughter and comfort and the smell of the orchard . And you were both such good boys . All the time good . Why , you did n't ever drink much and cut up , not even after you were grown men . Good friends and happiness , and the servants all satisfied . Where 's it all gone to , Danny ? Overnight , all gone . " " It will come back , Aunt Matty . We 'll bring it back somehow . " Daniel lied to the old lady , but his lies had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those days , he knew , would never return . When he thought of the days ahead his heart failed him . " I think I could have stood anything , " said Aunt Matty , " if you two boys were as you 've always been . Barney 's bitterness and accusations , Daniel , are breakingmy heart . Why should he hold it against you ? " " He 's not himself , " replied Daniel , wearily . " He 'll come round presently . His nerves are shot , that 's all . " Aunt Matty lowered her voice to a confidential whisper . Her bright eyes snapped . " Everything started with that Emily-Jane , " confided the old lady . " I wish I 'd pushed her off that rock myself . " Daniel derived no little comfort from the venomous wish of Aunt Matty . " I guess you 're back to normal now , " he said . " Let 's not worry any more , or better still , let me do all the worrying for you . I 'm used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a sudden impulse , bent over the bewildered and saddened old lady , and kissed her cheek . Then he left the room . Straight past Barney he walked , his eyes avoiding the easel , and across the lawnp141to the beach in search of Sam . He must be about somewhere . Then Daniel saw him . He was sitting on some rocks with Sue , and both looked miserable . When he joined them , the pair appeared relieved . " How 's your arm ? " asked Sam abruptly . " Doc Manning is quite proud of it , Sam . No need to trouble about the arm at all . " " That was a strange thing , " remarked Sue . " Stranger things have happened , Sue , " said Daniel . Sam showed no interest in the strangeness of thething . " Tell me , Dan , " continued Sue , " did Sam murder Emily-Jane ? " " Do n't mind me , " put in Sam . " I 'm somewhere else . " " Why do you ask , Sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murderer . He 's been sitting here muttering and grunting and scowling into my face . Why , you 'd think he was a couple of murderersat least . " " Do murderers go on like that , Sue ? " " Well , they could n't behave any worse . " " Then , Sam did it . The mystery is solved . " " I hope they catch him and hang him good , " saidSue . " Then perhaps he 'll come to his senses . " " It might be just the thing he needs , a good oldfashionedhanging . " " Ha , ha , "  --  the sound startled Daniel  --  " you 're an amusing couple , you two . A regular pair of Neros , playing the fiddle while Rome burns . Munson will have us all hung if we do n't slip him some arsenic mighty quick . " " What did I tell you ? " said Sue . " Those are the words of the worst type of murderer  --  a poisoner , no less . "  | For some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discourage the glinting surf playfully belaboring the sand , then as if at some unspoken command , the owners of the eyes arose withoutexpectation and , mounting the bluff , filed across the lawn to the house . Sue went on ahead , but Sam and Daniel were stopped by Munson . " Thanks for your assistance , Daniel , " said Munson , tapping the envelope containing the lint strands plucked from the body of Officer Shad , " but I hardly feel like lasing these . Your action has tied my hands . " " Stow that stuff , Scott , " replied Daniel goodnaturedly . " You probably think you 've got enough dope without them . You 'll use them if you think they 'll help you . My advice is to keep them , old man . You 'll need everything you can get to convict an innocent man . However , it has been clone . " Munson 's eyes snapped . " That 's not my game , Daniel , " he said . " Anti you know it . " " Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott , " remarked Daniel . Bennett appeared at the corner of the house and approached them . " Bennett , I want you to meet two of our best suspects , " said Scott , and he introduced them . " We 're neck and neck , " said Daniel , " vying for the honors . " " Well , I hope you both lose , " said Bennett , with evident sincerity as he shook hands . " I never heard of a murderer before voluntarily contributing evidence . " " It 's my kind heart , Bennett , " said Daniel . " I like to see everybody happy . " As Daniel and Sam walked away Bennett 's eyes followedthem . " A cool customer , " he remarked , referring to Daniel.  | " So damn cool , " replied Munson , " I expect him to crack at any moment now . " Just before they reached the veranda Sam halted Daniel . " Sorry as hell about that arm , Dan ; " he said rapidly . " I must have miscalculated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't talk about that , Sam , " replied Daniel , " but is n't it one devil of a mess ? " Barney was still painting , and in spite of every effort of will Daniel could not prevent himself from lingering over the picture . The old feeling gradually crept back , the old horror . The inquest was over . Both procedure and verdict had gone according to Munson 's carefully laid plans . He had succeeded in protecting the family , sparing Barney 's feelings , and saving the reputation of the dead girl . At the same time he had got exactly what he wanted , a clear field . The proceedings had attracted a little well-bred interest . About a dozen members of the Coastal Golf Club had motored over , more to pay their respects and to offer decently restrained condolences than to attend the inquest itself . Unalloyed astonishment seemed to be the prevailing mood . The thing was simply impossible . There must be some mistake . Then they had motored back ; cocktail time was perilously close at hand . Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manning had proved helpful without appearing to be so . He had encouraged speedy departures and warded off embarrassingquestions . One small creature composed entirely of eyes and legs did nothing else but look at Barney . He had scarcelypI44 been aware of her gaze . Her name was Sally Brent . Before the advent of Emily-Jane she had secretly entertainedcertain vaguely defined hopes . They were all about some day . She and Barney had  --  oh , well , there had always been Barney . Where was Barney now ? He seemed to be lost in some utterly remote region behind his brooding eyes . Little Sally smiled gamely and allowedold Brent to drive her home . Just the same , she felt sure that , given the right opportunity , she could have brought a little comfort to her erstwhile playmate and companion . And any female from the age of eight , obsessed with this fine fancy , is a constant source of danger to the object of her solicitude . It was twilight now . Barney was sitting at his easel . All afternoon he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting on the large canvas was gradually beginning to take on depth and definition . Whatever genius Barney had was going into its creation . His feelings for the bizarre found expression here in a weird atmospheric treatment . It was as much a painting of a mood as it was of a place or person . Several yards away Daniel was standing , his eyes burning into the picture . Although Barney was aware of his brother 's presence , he calmly continued with his brush . To Daniel there seemed to be something inevitablein the slow , unhesitating progress of the picture . It was like the sure-footed approach of Doom , dreadfully unhurried and confident . It was like a threat withheld until the time was ripe to strike . It was the face , the vague , cloudy , indistinguishable face of the figure that struck terror to Daniel 's soul . It was his face . Daniel knew it . It had to be his face . He could see it . He could see himself staring into the damp , murky night , filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel 's face had taken on the same expression it had worn at the time of the murder . His features were tortured and drawn , his neck cords taut , his body strained and rigid . All unknowingly , Daniel stood there , a self-confessed murderer . Scott Munson , appearing in the doorway , arrested his step , and took in the scene . From Daniel his eyes moved to the canvas , then back again to the agonized face . Munson received the impression that some terrible force , some impelling emotion , was goading Daniel against his will to offer himself as a model . Then a sigh escaped Daniel 's lips and his body relaxed . He passed a hand across his eyes and moved away like a man who had just gone through some exhausting physicaltest . Then he saw Munson for the first time and turned away . Barney 's bitter eyes looked mockingly into his . Helplessly he turned from side to side . He was trembling now , trembling inwardly . Every nerve in his body was lashing him with little nagging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimmer of intelligence kept urging him to pull in , for the moment of danger was at hand . He breathed deeply and threw back his shoulders . His head went up . But he did not trust his tongue to speak . Silently he passed Munson and went upstairs to his room . Munson walked over to Barney and looked sorrowfullyinto his eyes . " No , " he said . " You should n't do that . Daniel 's always been damn good to you . Some day soon , Barney , I 'm going to hurt you badly if only to bring you back to Dan . " He was thinking of five letters his searching hand had encountered tucked in a vest hanging under a number of other garments in a dark corner of Daniel 's closet.  |p146The  net was being drawn closer round Daniel . Munsonwas morally convinced that he had committed the crime . He knew that with the evidence he had already in hand he could make him pay the extreme penalty . Yet there had been other people out that night , people with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murder was forming itself in his mind . He would hold his hand for a while . . . . And all that night in Daniel 's room the light was kept burning . Whenever he turned it out the shadows of Barney and Emily-Jane kept flitting through the room . Thank God she had not screamed.  | SCOTT MUNSON was on a spot that interested him strangely . It was a lone narrow ledge about three feet wide , jutting out from High Point Rock four feet from its summit . Officers Shad and Red , flat on their respective stomachs , were following Munson 's movements with eyes filled with alarm . Vicariously they were dying a thousand deaths as their chief , apparentlyindifferent to his unenviable position , twisted his way round the uneven face of the cliff . In some places the ledge narrowed to the width of a foot . When Munsonapproached these perilous crossings , the Shays automatically closed their eyes , and with indrawn breath listened acutely for the crash which to them was now merely a matter of moments . " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " observed Red , " he would pick out this one . " " I thought I 'd pass out when he tried to lure us down there , " commented his colleague . " My resignation was trembling on the tip of my tongue , " replied Red . " He 's mad , " said Shad mildly , but with conviction . " Mad Munson , " amplified the redder Shay , who had a flair for rugged names . This was Scott 's third visit to the ledge , his third minute , inch by inch inspection . He had nothing to go on , nothing but . his imagination , a memory that constantlyeluded recapture , and a wild unsubstantial theory . And he had found nothing to justify his efforts . In one spot , which just so happened to be the rightpI48one , the moss had been disturbed . There were certain indentations . Along the ledge he found other similar marks , but these were so faint and undefined that he feared their discovery was due more to hope than to their actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . It formed an essential part of this wild theory which in turn was based on nothing more definite than an unwarranted suspicion . His staff watched him return from the ledge with mingled emotions . It had enjoyed being horrified and at the same time it was relieved to find their leader still among them . " From now on , " said Munson , brushing the earth from his hands , " your business will be to watch . Got guns ? " " We have , " replied Shad . " Mine seems awful heavy . " " Bear up under your burden , " said Munson , " and keep your eyes open . No one is to leave the grounds without my permission . " It struck both Shad and his associate , who were at heart good-natured , sociably inclined spirits , that this new duty was going to be highly uncongenial . It presentedso many opportunities for unpleasantness and friction , strained relations and mean looks . However , they accepted their new assignment with a fortitude worthy of the profession they so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the local guard . " Bronson , " he said , " you can go home now , and stay there if they 'll let you . Tell them at the lockup . Mr. Munson suggested you take a couple of days off . Make sure that your chief hears you . I 've finished with this place now . It 's open to the public . " " Thank you , sir , " said Bronson , smiling broadlyp149upon the Shays . " I 'll carry out your instructions to the letter . " " A couple of days off , " muttered Red , as he followedMunson along the Cliff Path . " Did you hear that ? What do we get ? Nothing but dangerous and disagreeable duty . " " After he 's through with us , " said Shad , " I 'm going to put in for a life pension . " " If you have any life left to pension , " amended his brother officer . " Now , " said Munson to himself , " it 's high time I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They could easily have been the feet I 'm looking for . " He found old Griggs in the orchard , doing helpful things to a peach tree . " Griggs , " he said , coming at once to the point , " was your helper out on the night of the murder or the accidentor whatever it was ? " " He was , sir , " replied Griggs . " I 've been waiting for this , Mr. Munson . He was out late , and he has n't been the same lad since . Got something on his mind , but I 'd stake my life he had no hand in it . " " Certainly not , " agreed Munson heartily , experiencinga strange sensation . Did he really want to hear the boy 's story ? He had to hear it . Nothing left for him to ( 1o . " What 's his name , Griggs ? I want to see him . Will you get him for me ? " " His name 's Tom , " said Griggs , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although Tom was not aware of that fact . To put it accurately , Munson did not actuallyknow the boy , but he knew the most important thing about him and that had to do with Betty , the maid . Tom was in love with this healthy wench , and very much in love at that . Ile was a boy with bangs , Torn . A boy with freckles and bangs . Good blue eyes that made up for everything , including a slight stoop and a pronounced tendency to stammer . " Torn , " said Munson , leading the boy aside , " there 's no trouble in this for you unless you fail to tell the exact truth . Stick to that and I 'm your friend . It 's all very simple and easy . All you have to do is to answer my questions . Here 's the first one . Why were you and Betty out so late on the night of the accident ? " " T-t-t  --  " Tom swallowed and began things afresh . " T-t-t-'t were n't no accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragments . With one question Munson had covered a lot of ground . But Tom , willing as he was to talk , was handicappedby nature . Munson did not like to listen to him . It made him feel spasmodic . He considered the situationa moment , then looked about the orchard . Far down toward the salt marshes were a bench and an old battered wicker rocking-chair . A pleasant , secluded , unassuming retreat . There he would hear the story . " Listen , Torn , " he said . " We all ought to be in on this , you , Betty , and I. It 's important . Now just run up to the house and bring Betty back to me . I 'll meet you down there . " He pointed to the bench . Betty , her vital young eyes bright although her cheeks had lost some of their color , showed no reluctance to talk once she was assured that the state of her virtue was not under investigation , that it was , in fact , taken for granted . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily enough , " because the party did n't break up until half past two , and I was helping to serve . "  |p151Munson  , sitting insecurely in the rain-warped wicker chair , nodded and continued to think . Might as well skip a lot of ground , he decided . Why lead up to it by dramatic stages ? Get the worst over at once  --  the confirmation of his suspicions , of his convictions , by eye-witnesses . Then he would do what had to be done , and the case would be over . Over , yes , but not before he had had a talk with young Barney and brought him back to poor Dan . His brother would need him now . " Then you actually stood under those high bushes ? " he asked . " We did , sir , " replied Betty , and Tom nodded . " We were afraid of being seen and misunderstood . " " Go on , Betty , " said Munson in a low voice . Betty settled herself on the bench and cast Tom a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of not understanding what it was all about . It was a look that meant , ; What I saw you saw and there 's no two ways about it . " Tom seemed to understand . " It was late , " began Betty , " and I was so hot from running here and there that I wanted to cool off before going to bed . Tom took me down to the Rock . We started out right away , about half past two . Well , we got there all right and the moon was just rising . Not much of a moon , though . " " Meet anyone on the way ? " " Not a soul , " replied Betty . " We walked to the edge of the Rock and stood looking out awhile , looking and talking and wondering sort of . Then we walked round the point to get a view of the marshes . Tefribly mysterious they looked in the moonlight . When we came back we were scared stiff to see Miss Emily-Jane and that man Holt  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had detected a note of anger in the girl 's voice . " You do n't seem to like Mr. Holt . Why ? " " He has n't let me alone since the first day he arrived , " replied Betty . " Does n't ever seem to get wise to himself . He just ca n't believe I wo n't fall for him . " Toni shifted restlessly on the bench and muttered some brief , private observation about a dog . " Well , you saw them standing there , " said Munson . " Then what , Betty ? " " We did n't want to pass them , " she continued , " so we stopped behind those high bushes . They were havinga long argument , and drinking . He was urging her to give up Mr. Barney and go away with him . She just laughed . Then , suddenly , his arms went out and he grabbed her . They were swaying there on the edge of the cliff . " At that moment there was a thrashing in the bushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its head . It rushed over to Holt and tried to drag him away . Then out pops another black figure and starts for the scramble , but it stops , this figure does . Stops sudden , just like it saw something unexpected . From where we stood , looking round the edge of the bushes , we could see plain enough , but we did n't see what that second figure saw . All we saw was the first figure slashing at that man Holt , trying to get him away from the girl , and Holt pushing with all his might . He swung round suddenly , and Miss Emily-Jane went over the edge of the cliff . " " Did she scream ? " asked Munson . " She made no sound . " " Funny , that , " thought Munson , " if she saw it coming . " Aloud he asked , " Did you recognize either of the hooded figures , Betty ? Think well . It does n't mean anything , but I 'd just like to get an idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p153She  looked everywhere but into Munson 's dark , steady eyes , which never left her face . " It can do no harm , Betty , " he said quietly , " and it might help me a lot . " Betty considered . " It 's just a guess , " she said , " so you ca n't hold it against me , and if it will help , I 'll tell . The figure that tried to save Miss Emily-Jane was just about the size of Mr. Dan . The one that scuttled back into the bushes was heavy like Mr. Stoughten . That 's the best I can do . " " And after that , Betty ? " " Holt split off through the darkness , " the girl went on , " and left the tall black figure standing alone on the rock . And it stripped off its hood , Mr. Munson "  --  here Betty 's voice took an an overtone of awe and she hesitated a moment  --  " and it was Mr. Dan . I lied about that . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was terrible , so full of pain and suffering it was . Just like he was being nailed to some invisible cross . He just stood there all the-while on the rock , then he left the rock and went down into the darkness below . " " By the pathway , you mean ? " " Yes , Mr. Munson . " The three of them sat in silence awhile , each one picturing the scene , then Munson spoke . " And after that , Betty ? " " We waited about ten minutes and went home . " " Did you meet anybody on the way , or see anybody about the house ? " " Only Miss June . She was just coming out of the pantry . Said she was having a cup of tea for herself . Had one shoe off . Said her feet hurt her . " " And was that what you saw , Tom ? " Betty 's glance seemed to set off some mechanism in Tom 's anatomy which in turn started his head nodding in violent agreement.  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tom sleeps in one of the outhouse 's with the men . It 's the same house where you 've lodged those two queer officers that keep following you about . " Munson smiled . " And why did n't you tell me about this before ? " he asked . " We were both afraid we might lose our places , " repliedBetty . " We like it here together and all . It did n't seem to matter much about Miss Emily-Jane . I did n't like her . " " But suppose we should have convicted an innocent man ? What would you have done then ? " " I 'd have snitched long before that , " the girl explained . " And in the meantime you were perfectly willing to let me work my head off looking for the murderer ? " " We decided it would give you something to do . We were interested to see if you 'd guess right . Did you ? " Once more Munson smiled , this time in spite of his irritation . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know . " " What are you going to do , Mr. Munson ? Do you mind telling ? " " This , " said Munson . " I 'm going to let you go now with the strict understanding that you 'll say nothing . You 've really placed yourselves within the reach of the law by withholding this information . You 'll have to make up for it now . When I 'm ready I 'll let you know and then I want you to repeat your story before Mr. Holt and probably in the presence of Sergeant Bennett . Will you do that for me ? " They readily agreed and departed almost on tiptoe , like sobered children . Munson remained where he was . He was lost in thought . He was very much afraid that Betty 's story would n't quite wash . It was true enough as far as it went . She believed she had seen what shep155had told him , but unconsciously she had been biased in her vision . As a result she had presented Lane Holt in the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen him as the murderer and Daniel as the hero rushing to the rescue . No , it would n't wash ; at least , Munson was not so sure . Her narrative of the actual killing had been too confused . Either one of them might have pushed the girl off , in spite of the fact that Betty claimed Holt had deliberately tried to do so , while Daniel had done just the opposite and attempted to save Emily-Jane . After all , Betty 's story might go with a jury , particularly when corroborated by the enslavedTom . Strong evidence , if properly rehearsed and presented . Why not go ahead with it ? Lane Holt was no good . What was his life worth compared with Daniel 's or Sam 's ? Munson was sorely tempted . It would be so very easy with the clues he had in hand , and the situation would be saved . Certainly of the three Holt acted the guiltiest . Well , all he could do was to put Betty 's story to the test , to confront Lane Holt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of such overwhelming direct evidence he might , if he were guilty , break down and confess . Rising from his chair , he walked slowly back to the house through the old orchard . He skirted the side of the house and came out on the lawn . He wondered if Emily-Jane 's body had been sent away yet , and seeing June Lansing sitting alone under the shade of a tree , he strolled over and asked her . " Yes , " said June calmly . " Emily-Jane has seen the last of Crewe House . A most unbereaved-looking old lady arrived while you were off somewhere , and carried her back to Ohio . Strange thing , that . Never even knew she came from Ohio . Somehow she did n't act as if she had come from there . "  | " Did you receive the old lady , or Aunt Matty ? " " The pair of us did . She was an odd old thing . Some sort of an aunt or other . She did n't seem to know what it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was doing it . " " Say anything about Emily-Jane ? " " Hardly knew her , she said . Emily-Jane rarely came home . Could n't drag her back except for a few weeks at a time . " " How did Barney act ? " " He did n't act . Just kept on painting . He 's mad . " June lit another cigarette . " He 's funny . The body was taken out the back way , so he did n't even see it leave . Anyway he has n't been interested in Emily-Jane 's body since the life went out of it . Looked at it once , then hurried away . For him Emily-Jane had ceased to exist . The body did n't matter . And all he said when he looked at her was , And back of all that beauty  --  ' He never finished his sentence . " June tossed her cigarette away and lit another one . " Wish it was all over , " she said . " Our Emily-Jane left a lot of trouble behind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You 're smoking too much , June , " said Munson . " I 've been noticing it of late . " He rose and walked away . June 's ale-colored eyes with their little speckles dwelt on him thoughtfully . She held out one hand and watched it . The fingers trembled slightly . " Guess he 's right , " she said to herself . " My nerves are going , too . " Munson started for his room . On his way up he met Aunt Matty , who had evidently sought refuge in trifles , for she was fussing about a lost domino , one that had never been worn . " There were six of them , " she was telling Betty ,  |p157who  gave the impression of being only mildly interested , " and now there are only five . The new one 's gone . " The old lady managed to cram so much tragedy into this last statement that Munson smiled as he mounted the stairs . Then suddenly he stopped , his foot half raised for the next step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was it . Was that domino actually lost or  --  A great shouting somewhere outside interruptedthis interesting line of thought . Munson ran down the stairs and out to the veranda . At the far end of the lawn , the end nearest the road , he made out a long pair of legs frantically raised aloft . Upon approaching these legs he discovered they were joined to the attenuated trunk of Officer Shad . Clutched in the officer 's arms as if it were a pearl of great price , was the head of Lane Holt . On the fringe of this grotesque struggle , Officer Red was capering excitedly , revolver in hand . " You hold him , and I 'll shoot him , " he was shouting for the benefit of the prostrate Shay . " For God 's sake , do n't shoot , " cried Shad . " Things are bad enough as they are . This devil 's trying to bite my ear clean offen my head . " Munson silently enjoyed the scene until he saw OfficerRed take deliberate aim at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holt . It was an irresistible target . Munson appreciated the fact , but felt called upon to intervene . " Sorry , Red , " he remarked . " I 'd like to take a try myself , but the situation does n't justify it , I 'm afraid . Put your gun away . " Then he addressed Officer Shad . " Let him up , Shad , " he said . " You have done well . " Shad seemed to think so himself , as he released the head and arose from the scene of battle.  | " He was trying to do a bunk , " he announced , pointing to a partially strangled Holt . " We told him to stop , but he would n't . So , " concluded Shad with modest satisfaction , " we stopped him . " " How about it , Holt ? " asked Munson . " They 're crazy as hell , " exclaimed Holt . " I was mooning about down here after Emily-Jane had gone  --  I 'd seen the last of her going down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , when all of a sudden these two lunatics rushed out from behind a bush and told me to stop . Naturally I told them to go to hell , and kept on walking . Then without word of warning they jumped on my back and down I went . Ever since then I 've just been trying to get up . That 's all . " " He damn well near bit my ear off , " said Officer Shad , applying a tender hand to the left side of his long head . " You would have been well avenged if Mr. Munson had n't stopped me , " said Officer Red . " There seems to have been a general misunderstanding , " Munson observed , " but I must admit you boys did well . I 'm proud of you . Carry on . " Taking Holt by the arm he led him back across the lawn . " Holt , " he said , " if you feel up to it , I 'd like to have you meet me in the little study at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour . " He looked at his watch . " It 's eleven-thirty now and luncheon is not until one . Think you can make it ? " The man shrugged his drooping shoulders rather hopelessly . " Oh , hell , what does it matter anyway ? " he said in a flat voice . " I 'll be there . . . . Might as well get it over . I do n't care a damn now one way or another , P159but I suggest you have a little talk with your good friend Daniel . " He broke away from Munson and went into the house . Munson found Bennett , who had just returned from making inquiries at the neighboring houses in an endeavor to ascertain if any of the servants had been near High Point Rock on the night of the murder . He had had no luck . When Munson told him his story his eyes lighted up . " Then that settles everything , " he said . " We 'll drill a confession out of his hide and I 'll take him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ice , Mr. Munson . " But Scott only smiled wearily as he turned toward the house . " I 'm not so sure , Bennett , " he said . " Sometimesyou ca n't depend on the accuracy of eye-witnesseseven . " " But their story would convince any jury . " " Yes , " replied Scott , " and that 's what irks me. "  | DANIEL 'S study was like a happy thought on a dull day . It was an unexpected relief . At the extremeleft end of the house , it was approached by way of a long crazy corridor that ambled past a series of pleasant rooms , each of which invited the passer to enter and linger awhile . It was not so much a study as it was a retreat  --  an escape from boredom when life turned drab . Here there were books and comfortable chairs and the smell of tobacco . Its front windows gave to the lawn and the broad sweep of the Sound ; those at the side commanded a view of the orchard with the glinting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees . From the study a door led directly to the veranda where it curved round the house , and here there were several easy chairs . It was like a private deck on an ocean liner , an essential part of the whole , yet cut off and remote . It was by way of the veranda door that Munson and Bennett now entered . The room seemed lost to the world , so still and tranquil it was . And Daniel was a part of its stillness . At one of the side windows he was standing in an attitude of tense immobility . Deep in thought , he stood with his sunken eyes brooding out over the salt marshes where the sluggish streams twisted through the reeds . On his face was an expression of utter weariness and defeat . His was the face of a man who was very much alone with himself . The two men were in the room before he turned from the window . He regarded them in silence for ap161moment ; then an expression of resignation came into his eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , " I suppose you want me ? " " Why should we want you , Dan ? " asked Munson quickly . " For murder , " he replied in level tones . " That 's all you want anyone for these days , Scott . " " Well , this time , Daniel , we 're not after you , but your room . Mr. Lane Holt has promised to meet us here for a chatty half-hour . I 've a feeling he 's got an interesting story to tell . I 've the same feeling about you and Sam , and I 've promised myself the pleasure of listening to those stories within the next few days . " Daniel slightly inclined his head . " I shall try to make mine as interesting as possible and as unenlight-ening . " Munson smiled rather sadly . " Things have gone far beyond that , Daniel , " he said . " We 'll have to have a showdown soon . You know I ca n't keep stalling on the job forever . " Holt entered the room by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their eyes met , and those of Holt were filled with an insane hatred . He looked upon Daniel as the cause of all the misery through which he had passed , the nights and days of cold , pursuingfear . But for Daniel , Emily-Jane would be alive today , and he , Holt , would be safe . . . and happy . His lips bared his white , even teeth as he uttered one word , " Murderer ! " On the silence of the room the word fell jarringly , accusingly . Daniel received it with an expressionless face . He seemed to be considering the man before him as if he were some microscopic specimen . Presently he spoke . His voice was quiet and well controlled.  | " I 'm beginning to wonder about that , " he said , and walked to the veranda door where he stopped and looked back . " Holt , " he continued , " you do n't deserve to live , and I 've a strange feeling that you wo n't live much longer . " He grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen stalking across the lawn . " What the devil did he mean by that ? " asked Holt nervously . " Nothing good for you , " said Sergeant Bennett , with a grim smile . " I would n't be alone with him if I were in your place . " Munson was looking worried . Just what had Daniel meant , anyway ? His remark had made Scott feel jumpy . He shrugged his shoulders . Probably Daniel had only wanted to throw , a scare into Holt . Well , Holt was scared enough as it was . No need to paint the lily . He turned to the rather pitiful object of his thoughts and studied his fear-haunted , feverish eyes with their thinly veiled depths of hate . His scrutiny convinced him that Holt 's mind was sick , that the man had already departed from the rational ways of thinkingand was keeping to the tracks merely through fear and force of habit . A thin ray of pity momentarily touched Munson . Perhaps , after all , Emily-Jane 's going out had left an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dejectedly before him , as rotten as he was . " Sit down , " he said in a kindly voice , for he realized that Lane Holt was about to be subjected to a test that would tax the strongest nerves , and he had grave doubts regarding the man 's ability to stand it . Holt , without speaking , slumped lethargically into an easy chair and kept his eyes on the floor . The kindly tone affected by Munson had increased rather thanP163diminished his fear . It was suggestive of a bountiful meal just previous to execution . Munson could afford to be kindly only when things were going his way . Holt entertained the morbid impression that the two men were looking at him as if he were already dead . He moved uneasily in his chair . His gaze strayed over the floor  --  anywhere but up . " Well , " he said at last , irritably , " did you get me here just to look at me ? Let 's get this over . " " All right , Bennett , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . You 'll find them at the back of the house . " Bennett was not long in returning with the maid and her lumbering but obedient slave . Munson saw them comfortably seated and made them feel at ease . The expression of fear deepened in Holt 's eyes . He had given the pair one quick glance , but had refused to meet Betty 's accusing gaze . " Now , Betty , " said Munson in an easy voice , " all you have to do is to sit there and tell your story just as if you were telling it to someone in no way concerned with the case . Understand ? Make everything clear , but be sure about your details , and do n't for , the love of Pete imagine things . Just stick to what you know , what you actually heard and saw . " The girl had her story clearly briefed in her mind by this time , and she told it with a simple conviction that left no room for doubting her sincerity . As her participation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crept up from the floor until they rested on Betty 's full red lips as if held there by some terrible attraction . Occasionally Munson interrupted the story to ask Holt a question . " Did you quarrel , Holt , while you were standing there near the edge of the cliff ? "   " No , " came Holt 's unsteady voice , " we did n't quarrel at all . At first we argued a little , but after a while we gave that up . " " All right , Betty , go on . " And Betty went on to the ghastly climax , which seemed more ghastly still because of the stark simplicitywith which she narrated it . Holt was on his feet , his face working and lips dry . There was a kind of hopeless desperation in his eyes . He spoke like a man who had no expectation of being believed , yet his words were urgent , pleading . " She 's wrong , " he said . " They did n't see that . The whole thing was confused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of her story she sticks to the facts , except about our quarreling . Then at the most important part she deliberately reverses what actually happened . It does n't make sense . What reason had I for killing Emily-Jane ? I tell you I was fond of her in my way , and she was fond of me . I had nothing to fear from her . You have Sam Stoughten 's letters . There 's a motive for you , stronger than any you can pin on me . " " But you wanted those letters , Holt , " Munson quietly reminded him . " Oh , hell , yes ! " cried Holt . " Perhaps I did , but that was after the thing had happened . I only thought of them then . I 'm a rotter , if you want to have it that way , but I did n't murder Emily-Jane . " " Then you mean you wo n't confess ? " asked Bennett . " You 're going through with it ? What 's the sense , man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your flask at the scene of the crime , your actions after the crime , and your admitted relationship with the dead girl ? Why drag out the misery , Holt ? It will come to the same thing in the end . " P165Munson had remained silent . He preferred to let Bennett try his hand . He was more convinced than ever that Lane Holt was innocent , yet he could not brush aside the testimony of two obviously sincere eyewitnesses . Everything was unsatisfactory about this case . Munson heartily wished he was out of it . Holt turned to him . " Are you going to arrest me on that ? " he asked . Munson considered while Bennett watched him eagerly . " I do n't know , " he said at last . " I 'm not sure , but stick around , Holt . We might be wanting you at any minute . " Holt started to say something , then gave it up as if the effort were too hopeless . His whole being was dipped in a clinging hatred of Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could only get back at Daniel . If he could only pin the guilt on him . Holt felt that he would willingly sacrifice anything for that . He left the room.unsteadily , holding on to the frame of the door for support . In the library he sat down at Daniel 's great desk and thought . With the hounds of fear rushingacross his brain he found that he could still think clearly and to some purpose . Gradually an evil smile twisted his white lips . " They 'll have to believe that , " he said to himself . " There will be no getting round it . " Daniel found June in her favorite chair on the lawn . She was doing nothing , absolutely nothing . Her thoughts were adrift in space . And although her expression was calm and composed , Daniel felt that her spirit was tense and waiting . He could not account for this feeling . Yet he knew that June was passing through her own little private hell and that he was re- sponsible . The realization of this was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she was fighting silently with the truth in her heart ? What was Holt saying to Munson back there in the study ? Was he telling what he knew , and would Scott Munson believe him ? June looked up and smiled . " There 's a chair , " she said , pointing to one with her foot . " Drag it over here and fold up your great length in it . " " Munson has collared Holt , " said Daniel , doing as he was bidden . " They 've got him in there now . " " I 'd like to hear his story , Dan . " " So would I , and then again I would n't . " She turned in her chair and looked at him in a way that was unusual for her . Her eyes were so tender and unhappy . . . they were lonely , those eyes of June 's . Daniel felt himself powerless to help her . " You have nothing to fear , Daniel , " she told him . " Do n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " " Do you believe that , June ? " " Yes , Dan . Stick it out . " " Together we 'll see it through . " " We 'll see it through and farther . " " How about our yacht ? " " Is there such a thing ? " " Yes , June . It 's a swell yacht . " " Manning ? " " Through Manning . " She pondered awhile in silence , then , " Well , keep the yacht in mind , Dan . " Her voice broke and she turned her head away . " Although it may be only a crazy hunch . " His hand was gripping hers . " Come back and fight , June , " he pleaded .   " Half a minute , old dear . I 'll fight . " " And you know ? " Her head sank on her breast . " Dan , " she whispered , " I 've always known . " " Sorry , June . " His voice was dead . She turned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm only sorry for you . " " And me for you , dear . " A long silence , then June , " We 'll make the grade somehow . " " In our yacht ? " " Sure , " she smiled . " That yacht 's gotten the best of you . " " I 've always been fond of the sea , June , you know . " She was holding everything back now . Her teethwere set , and her hands gripped the arms of her chair . " I know , Dan . I like it , too . " " All the world and places , " he murmured , his eyes on the broad blue Sound . " Clear of this dismal damn mess . " " That 's the way I like to hear you talk . Your old face looks so worn . " And he rested his head on her shoulder , but he was n't very comfortable . Neither was June . Since the death of Emily-Jane , meals at Crewe House had been rather sketchy affairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Matty had n't known what the world was ever coming to . And no matter how often and thoroughly she washed her hands of everything she was still very much involved . At luncheon both Holt and Daniel were absent , which , according to Aunt Matty , made it a pretty state of affairs . The head of the house not sitting down at his own table , and his own blood brother gnawing away like a dog and saying never a word . " But what 's the use of being head of the house unless you can do as you please ? " asked June . Aunt Matty cast her an indignant look . " There is n't any head to this house , " she pronounced , " and still less tail . " Sue Stoughten laughed so earnestly over this that Aunt Matty thought she had really been funny . The old lady felt much better . Munson endeavored to lead Sam into the ways of speech , but Sam , suspecting a trap , was sparing of his words . Bennett , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of well-controlled but effective eating . Barney , as Aunt Matty had put it , just gnawed away in stubborn silence . Then came the shot  --  the sound of a shot . White faces lifted and forks suspended . For what were they waiting ? No one seemed to know . They were held there because all their instincts told them urgently that they did not want to know . There had been enough of tragedy  --  enough of death . Keep out of it . Do n't know . Do n't try to find out . Bennett , however , wanted to know and intended to find out . The sound of the shot had hardly died away before he was out of the dining-room and up the stairs . For only a moment he paused , then ran down the hall to an open door . Daniel was standing in it , a piece of paper crushed in his hand . " Come back in here with me , Mr. Crewe , " said Bennettin a quietly commanding voice , as he brushed past Daniel and entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition , turned and followed the detective . Below at the foot of the stairs , Scott Munson sarcasti-P169ally excused himself as he passed between Officers Shad and Red , each politely insisting that the other ascend first . Bennett stood in the middle of the room and took in the situation . At a large table Lane Holt sat . He was sprawled out and his head was flung back and he was dead . In his right hand he held a pen , and in his left temple there was a hole made by a bullet fired at close range . Munson was there now . Mechanically he felt the man 's heart . It would never again harbor hate or fear . " Well , he 's out of the case , " said Munson , looking regretfully down at the grotesque figure . " This leaves us about half-way up a tree . " For a moment he looked about him , then he deliberatelyplaced a chair against the wall where he commanded a full view of the room , and sat down . " Sit down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strained . " Bennett , go to the door and ask those two faces please to withdraw . They confuse me . Tell one of them to telephone the coroner and tell him to bring a doctor . Then come back here and stand by my chair . I want you to see with me . " When Bennett had dispatched the stunned Shays he returned to Munson 's chair and once more looked about the room . " Take notes , " said Munson . " I want you to remembereverything . Daniel , you say , was just leaving the room when you reached the door . He had a piece of crumpled paper in his hand . Put that down . Now just make brief notes as I go along . Pen in dead man 's right hand . Wound in left temple fired at close range . Handkerchief on floor at left side . Ink bottle open . Service revolver at far end of room under window . Probably thrown there by murderer . Is it your gun , P170Daniel ? " His eyes met Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes , Bennett , " said Munson . " Servicerevolver the admitted property of Daniel Crewe . Now draw a line . " Munson looked up . " All right , Daniel , " he said , then added , " Get this , Bennett . " " My story 's so simple , " replied Daniel , " it sounds foolish . " " Tell it , " said Munson . " I was in my room . " Daniel spoke in a detached , matter-of-fact voice . " Lane Holt called me . His words were : Daniel , please come here . ' He sounded urgent . I got up from the bed and walked across the hall . There was a shot . As I opened the door I thought I heard something scraping across the floor . I entered the room but saw nothing moving . Holt was as he is now . I went to him and saw he was dead . Then I saw what he had been writing and I took the sheet of paper , hoping to get away with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel smiled sardonically  --  " that 's all . " Bring me the paper , Bennett . " Daniel relinquished his hold on the paper . It dropped into Bennett 's outstretched hand . He brought it over to Munson , who smoothed it out and read : Dear Munson : I am going to hand you this statement to read , becausewhenever I try to tell you the truth I can see you do n't believe me and then I lose my nerve . Everything that Betty said was true . I agree in every detail with two exceptions . We did not quarrel . I did not touch Emily-Jane . Daniel Crewe deliberatelymurdered her , and if you want to find out the facts I dare you to grill Sam Stoughten . At the same time ask him who did the stabbing . If you 're so damned honest think this over . Daniel Crewe is the murdP171At the point where the statement broke off there was a small splash of ink . The lower part of the letter was smeared where the writing had not yet dried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Munson 's voice was toneless . " I did n't do it , Scott . " " It 's better to be arrested for this murder than the other one . " There seemed to be some hidden significancein Scott 's words . Daniel left the room with Bennett . Munson sank back in his chair . When Judson , the coroner , arrived with the doctor he was still sitting in the same position . " Another killing , Judson , " he said . " I 'd like to hold the inquest at four tomorrow . Let me see . " He looked at his watch . " That will give me a little less than twenty-seven hours . " " It looks like a fairly simple case , " Judson observed after he had heard the details . " I 'm sorry as hell for Daniel Crewe . He 's a fine lad . " He paused and looked round the room , then said in a puzzled voice , " I wonder what the devil 's got into this old house anyway ? " " You tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it , June . " Daniel spoke rapidly while Bennett stood by . He admired Daniel Crewe . " Can you prove it , Dan ? " June 's face was deathly pale , but her voice was as calm as ever and her eyes held no hint of fear . Daniel shook his head and grinned from complete frustration . " It 's silly , " he said . " It 's so damned pat . Why , it could n't look more convincing if I 'd dragged him into the dining-room and strangled him before your eyes . " " What does Scott think ? " pI72 " What can he think ? " Daniel hesitated , rememberingMunson 's words . " He acted sort of funny , though , " he added . " Seemed to have something on his mind . " " It 's all right , " said June . " Think so ? " said Daniel . " It 's all right , " she repeated , and kissed him . Then she turned to Bennett and smiled , " Take him away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was driven down the road . June stood there waving to him until the trees closed over the car . Barney at his easel watched his brother depart . Save for a slight tightening round the lips his expression did not change . June sank into a chair and let the tears chase each other down her freckled cheeks . Barney tried to pretendhe did not notice her . He began to fidget fretfully on his stool . Finally he put down his brushes and looked at her uncomfortably . " Do n't do that , " he . commanded explosively . " What are you doing ? " " I 'm crying , you young fool . Crying like hell . " " Why ? " " They 've arrested Daniel . " " Good . Why ? " " They claim he shot Lane Holt . " " What '  --  he doing , anyway  --  making a hobby of it ? " " Barney , I could kill you . " " Wish you would , June . " Barney 's voice was sufficientlybitter . He regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in ? " he asked . " Holt 's dead , " she replied . " Good , " said Barney , with undisguised satisfaction . June smiled in spite of her tears . " You have no soul , Barney . " P173For the remainder of the day Barney was unable to paint . He passed most of the time sitting on his brother 's bed . Only June Lansing knew where he was . She left him entirely alone .   SOMETHING scraping across the floor . Something scraping across the floor . Now what in hell did he mean by that ? " Munson , as he wandered about the room , was entertaininghimself with the mumblings of his own voice . " Scraping , scraping , scraping , " he continued tinder his breath . " What was scraping ? Did n't sound like a lie . Did n't work in anywhere . " Once more he returned to his chair and sat down . Why was he so convinced that Daniel had not shot Lane Holt ? All the facts cried out against him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found shot through the head , Daniel had told him he did not deserve to live and had predicted his speedy death . " I have a strange feeling that you wo n't live much longer "  --  those were the exact words he had used . Now , here was Holt dead , obviously murdered . Then , there was the gun . Munson cast the revolver a disgusted glance . He knew what marks were on that gun  --  Daniel 's finger-prints . Munson would see about that later . But why had he tossed it over there by the window ? Damn fool thing to do . And the bullet the doctor had extracted from Lane Holt 's brain had been shot from Daniel 's revolver . All the pieces fitted togetherperfectly . And Daniel had been caught with an incriminating statement written by the dead man crushed in his hand . Judson had put it conservatively when he observed that the case looked fairly simple . It was altogether too174P175simple . Either that , or Daniel , convinced that any moment he would be charged with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweep of things . Munson got up and walked over to the table . He seated himself where Holt had sat , and leveled his eyes on the revolver on the floor twelve feet away , near the window directly in front of him . Munson noticed that the window was about two inches open from the bottom . This fact did not impress him at the moment . He closed his eyes and let the stillness of the room settle round him . He was not thinking now . His brain was merely receiving impressions . Over there on the bed lay a dead man . And just before he had become such a dead man something had happened to his mind . Munsoncould feel once more the crazy eyes of Lane Holt furtively looking at him . Yes , undoubtedly , the man had been mentally unbalanced , morally and mentally warped through a conflict of fear and hate . Made melancholy , perhaps , from brooding over the death of Emily-Jane . What did this mean ? How could he work it in , use it to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smoothed it out on the desk . For some minutes he studied the writing . There was something peculiar about that writing , a mechanical difference rather than an expression of the writer 's personality . Well , he 'd have to see about that , too . And there was that handkerchiefon the floor at the left side of the chair . SubconsciouslyMunson was laying the foundation of his investigations . Suspicions , impressions and questions were lying fallow in his mind . For the time being he had completely dismissed all consideration of the first murder . That would have to wait , although the motive for the murder of Lane Holt must have sprungp176from that of Emily-Jane . The two were inseparably linked , results of the same situation . Leaving the table , he walked over to the bed and drew down the sheet . There was Lane Holt , the once jaunty and debonair lover of Emily-Jane . Shot in the left temple at close range . Why the left temple ? Why not ? Well , for one thing it was the side nearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the most awkward side to approach . Daniel would have been forced to squeeze himself in between the open door and the table . Much easier to go round the other way , much easier and more natural . But Munson was not greatly interested in the bullet hole in Lane Holt 's head . His eyes were intently studying every detail of the man 's hands now lying curled and useless on the spread . Munson bent over and scrutinized those hands . " An immaculate devil , " he thought as his eyes dwelt on the meticulously manicured nails . Then , carefully taking the dead man 's wrists he raised the hands and inspected each finger in turn . Gradually , yet with increasing momentum , a grin , a grin of almost beatific proportions , broke the severe lines of Scott Munson 's lips . Then the grin , having achieved its triumphant climax , suddenly collapsed . Munson recovered the figure and turned away . " Oh , hell , " he reflected , and a look of discouragement settled on his face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge if only to bring another one against him ? " Still , the other charge would be more difficult to prove than this one . Here everything was all set up . Just waiting for some jury to pounce upon . The murder of Emily-Jane was a great deal more complicated . There were other persons involved . No , he would have to get Daniel out of this scrape no matter what might happen in the future . Very easy to say , but how was lie going to do it ? P177In the kitchen the Shays were hovering over a belatedmeal . They felt somewhat despised and rejected , having been so summarily dismissed from the scene of the crime . Their appetites remained unimpaired . " And to think , " remarked Officer Shad impressively , arresting the upward progress of a skilfully laden fork , " just to think that only a few short hours ago I was locked in a desperate struggle with him . My ear will bear the marks of his teeth to its grave . " " Well , the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its grave , " observed Officer Red . " If it had n't been for Mr. Munson it ' ud have gone in plop . I had a dead bead on it . " " A dangerous case , this , " said Officer Shad . " I wonder who goes next ? Looks to me like a sort of a general killing off . " " They call it the process of elimination , " came sententiouslyfrom Red . " They go on and on and on , until only one is left , and then he gets all the money . " " Whose money ? " " All the money there is . " " In what ? " " All the money there is in the will . " Officer Red was quite convinced about this . , " There 's always a will in cases like these , and that naturally leads to elimination . " " Naturally , " agreed Shad . " Now , the way I figure this case out , that guy Holt must have been a collateral cousin . Get me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skeptical gaze . " He certainly was mean , " once more agreed Shad . " The way he went after my ear . " " And being a collateral cousin he comes in under the will , " continued Red . " And that starts all this bumping off business . They 're all after the money , and "  - -   - -   he lowered his voice  --  " the old lady bearsP178watching . From the way she bustles us about and keeps shooing us out of the house you can tell she does n't want us around . No , sir . She 's afraid of us . And did you ever notice how she keeps peering into things like she was looking for something ? The will . That 's what.she 's after , mark my words . " He leaned back in his chair with a complacent expression on his face , which , if anything , was a few shades redder due to the exertion caused by eating and talking at the same time . " I wonder where that will is ? " mused Officer Shad . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could find it . " " Then keep your eye on the old dame , " said the master mind of the pair , " and look in places whenever they let us in the house . " " It must be a mighty valuable will , " said Officer Shad , " what with two killings and one stabbing al-ready . " Further elucidation of the case was interrupted by the appearance of Dora . This superior and comely domestic eyed the pair with a look of disgust that bordered almost on loathing . " Mr. Munson wants you two , " she said . " He 's up in the room with the corpe . " " The what ? " from Officer Red incredulously . " I said it , " snapped the girl . " The corpe . " " No , no , my dear , " said the officer gently . " It 's notcorpe . The word is corpse . " " And , " put in Officer Shad admonishingly , " you certainly should get to know that word with nothing else but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were knocking about with them , " retortedDora , as the officers marched from the room . Munson was back in his chair when the Shays answered his summons .   " The grounds are unguarded , sir , " announced Shad . " Well , you can give the grounds a rest for a while , " said Munson . " No one is trying to get away now . I have more important work for you to do . " Uneasy glances passed between the officers . " Yes , " continued Munson , " I want you to watch me . " " You mean , " Shad 's voice was uncertain , " to see that they do n't do you in ? " " Among other things , " replied Munson gravely , " but just now I want Shad to make a circle round that gun down there . Do n't touch it . " Shad walked down to the gun , then gingerly circled round it , carefully placing his long feet the one in front of the other . Munson watched him abstractedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask , do you think you 're doing , Shad ? " Shad looked up from his delicate task . " Making a circle around the gun , " he replied . " Like you said . " " Not like I said at all , " snapped Munson . " Here , take this piece of chalk and draw a circle round the thing . " " A perfect circle ? " asked the officer , " or just rough ? " Munson looked at the crouching Shad a long time . No one will ever know what thoughts were passing through his mind , what violent impulses he was controlling . At last he rose wearily and walked down the room . With a piece of white chalk he carefully marked the position of the revolver , then thrusting a long pencil into its barrel he carried it back to his chair . Shad looked at Red with eloquently elevated eyebrows , shrugged his shoulders , then stood up and idly watched his chief . Scott Munson was humming under his breath . Still humming he raised his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthies began to shift about uncomfortably . " Come here , boys , " he said pleasantly . " I want you to see what I see in case my testimonyrequires corroboration . " The officers allowed themselves to draw near . " Do you see the trigger guard on this revolver ? " asked Munson . " We do , " vouchsafed Shad , hoping thereby to reinstatehimself in the good graces of his chief . " And do you see a small piece of thin , strong thread attached to it ? " Munson could not keep an element of excitement from his voice . " We do . " This time they spoke in unison . " Well , " continued Munson , " what do you think it 's there for ? " A heavy silence , at last broken by Officer Shad . " Maybe , " he said , " there 's two revolvers just alike in the house and they tied that thread on to one of them so they could tell them apart like they do with tooth-brushes . " " And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I confect , " replied Red brightly , " that the gun was hung on the wall somewhere . " " Thank you both , " said Munson dryly . " ' You stay here until I return and do n't go monkeying round with that body on the bed . " Both officers hastily disclaimed any intention of so doing . As a matter of fact , since entering the room they had sedulously avoided even glancing at the sheetcoveredbody . They would have preferred not to have been left alone with it . When Munson returned he had established the fact that the butt of the revolver bore three clear fingerprintsmade by Daniel . He had compared them with aP181set already in his possession . He wondered moodily how he was going to be able to laugh that off . " Now for a look at the corpse , " he said briskly . " Come over here , boys . " The boys approached the bed , but it was plain to see that their hearts were not in their , feet . Munson pulled down the sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands , " he said . Munson raised the hands so abruptly that the officers started back nervously . " Did you want us to sniff them ? " asked Officer Red . " That will hardly be necessary now , " replied Munson . " Just look at them . You observe that the two fingersnext to the thumb on the left hand are slightly smeared with ink , do n't you ? " Yes , they observed that . " Well , remember it , " said Munson . " Now , Shad , go over there by.fhe table at the left-hand side of the chair , and draw a circle round that handkerchief on the floor . Do n't cut up any more capers . " This time Shad did splendidly . " Now come with me , " said Munson . Followed by his staff , he left the room and locked the door . He hurried downstairs to the library and called up Manning on the telephone . Dr. Manning was on the point of leaving for the club , an attractive feminine voice informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now , what is it ? " came Manning 's voice . " Have you heard our latest joke ? " asked Munson . " Oh , it 's you , Munson , " the speaker at the other end of the line replied . " Thought I recognized your voice . No , I have n't heard a damn thing . Just got up . A swell night . What is it ? " " Lane Holt was shot to death in his room at about one o'clock today . Daniel has been detained at the villagelockup pending the inquest . It will be held at four tomorrow afternoon . " Munson spoke tersely . A series of " Good Gods " dropped heedlessly by the horrified doctor had accompanied Munson 's information . Now that Munson had ceased speaking , Manning had the field to himself . He proceeded to take advantage of it . Finally he drew breath and asked , " But did he really do it , Scott ? " " They have an absolutely water-tight case against him unless I can break it between now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Anything . What do you want ? " " Did you ever play golf with Lane Holt ? " Manning 's answer to that and several following questions ended with : " I 'll be on the dot tomorrow to testify to that effect . Any reporters yet ? " " Thanks for reminding me , " replied Scott . " I have just the boys for them . Good-by , Manning . " He snapped the instrument down and favored his staff with a broad grin . " I 've a wonderful assignment for you , " he said . Suspicion sullied the eyes of the officers . " Yes , " continued Munson . " A wonderful assignment . You go out there on the lawn and keep your eyes open for newspaper men . Do n't let them near the house . They do n't wear badges on their sleeves or cards in their hat bands . They look very much like anyone else when they 're sober , but they do n't know the meaning of truth the way you and I understand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you give them a chance . They 'll even go so far as to adopt disguises just to get themselves into the place . Now , I rely on you boys to stop all that . We 've had trouble enough already . The women are in on this , too . Go out and protect them . "   " Oh , we know how to handle those birds , " began Officer Red . " I remember once  --  " " March ! " interrupted Munson , and the boys left the room . Munson went to the window . He had caught a glimpse of June Lansing on the veranda . There she was , all sprawled out in a chair , the whole rangy body of her . And she was looking comfortably miserable . Munson was aware of June 's penchant for lolling away the hours doing nothing or as little as possible and enjoyingherself hugely . Now , however , she did not look as if she were greatly enjoying her slothful repose . Her eyes were open , those funny eyes of hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious of seeing . All receptivity to life and the movements of life seemed to have gassed from them . Blankly and flatly they gazed at nothing . Munson stepped through the French window and quietly approached her . " June , " he asked , " do you happen to know where Dtaniel kept his revolver ? " June did not stir . She was beyond being startled . " I have n't the slightest idea , Scott ? " she replied coldly . " June , " said Munson . " Look at me . " The girl raised her eyes to his . " I 'm working for Daniel in this . " " Do you mean that , Scott ? " " I 'm the only one left to do it , and I 'm going to get him off . He 'll be a free man tomorrow . " " Oh , Scott , are you sure ? " She was not much at hiving a public demonstration of her feeling , but in this instance she was unable to keep the depth of her anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind has gone all bad , " replied Scott , " I 'm fairly sure I 'll be able to throw a large-sized monkey-wrench into the works . " PI84 " But things look pretty bad for him , do n't they ? " " Could n't look worse , " was Munson 's frank reply . " That 's what gives me hope . There 's such a thing as looking too damn guilty . " " He always keeps his revolver in the right-hand top drawer of the library desk , " said June . " It was there only yesterday . I saw him handling the ugly thing and I made him put it away . Daniel is in no frame of mind to be handling dangerous weapons . " " Did anyone else see him handling that revolver ? " Munson asked quickly . " No , " replied June . " That is , no one paid any special attention to him . Lane Holt passed the door on his way upstairs . He just glanced in and kept on going . " " You 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ? It 's a fact . " " Thanks , June , " said Munson cheerfully . " You 've done me a world of good . Also Daniel . " He returned to the desk in the library and sat down at it . For a long time he surveyed the smooth dark surface before him . There were the leather-tipped blotter , the scissors , and the paper-knife . Several books stood at one end , at the other a roll of blue-prints . Daniel was forever planning the building of something or other and not doing it . And there were the pens . Yes , there were the pens  --  three of them straying at random across the desk . Those pens . Munson became very still as he looked at them . There was something wrong about those pens . What was it ? They looked lost and out of place . He never recalled having seen them that way before , or had he ? Damned if he was sure . He reached out a hand and delicately felt the surface of the desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had rested there once . There were faint scratches . He could feel them and he couldP185see them . He closed his eyes and thought about the desk to the exclusion of everything else . There should be an inkstand . There always had been an inkstand , one with a place for the pens . Funny thing  --  with his eyes closed he could see it perfectly . There it was . A long flat slab of bronze pierced by two wells . And the base of the stand was grooved to accommodate three pens , to be specific , the three pens now lying in disorder on the desk . Munson rose quickly and left the room . Betty was in the kitchen drinking tea , but at his request she willingly put down her cup and followed him to the library . " Betty , " he said , " you take care of this room . I see you messing about here every day . " " Yes , sir , " replied Betty . " Not exactly messing , Mr. Munson . " " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreeable hypocrisy . " Just my way of putting it . Now where 's the inkstand , Betty ? " Betty looked at the desk in surprise , then her expressionchanged to one of indignation . She eyed the desk accusingly . " Why , it 's gone , Mr. Munson , " she said . " It is n't there . And it was there this morning . " " You know that ? " " I know it , sir . " Munson remained silent , then he turned and paced the length of the room and back . If Lane Holt had taken Daniel 's revolver he might have also taken the inkstand , but there was no proof that he had taken either . And what did he want with the inkstand ? There was a bottle of ink in his room . Munson stopped in front of Betty . " Where were you around one o'clock today ? " he asked her.  | " Standing out there in the hall , " replied Betty , pointing to a spot just outside the wide door . " See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . From the time I told what Tom and me had seen down at the Rock before him in Mr. Dan 's study I kept looking out for that man . His eyes had scared me proper . So when I saw him coming out of this room , I just eased myself out of his way . " " Where did he go after he left this room ? " " He went right on upstairs . " " Was he carrying anything , Betty ? Think hard . " " No , sir . He had his handkerchief in his hand . " " Was it a large handkerchief , did you happen tonotice ? " " Yes , sir , now that you come to mention it , I remember how it hung down . " " Do you think he could have been using it to cover something he was carrying ? " Betty gave a quick cry of triumph . " That 's it , Mr. Munson , " she said . " I should have known it right off . " " Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it was glued there . " Munson 's smile of gratification was swiftly changed to one of consternation at the sudden sound of revolversbeing discharged at top speed . " Oh , mother ! " cried Betty , flinging her arms round Munson . " We 'll all be murdered now . " Munson disentangled himself from the throttling embrace of the girl and rushed out to the veranda just in time to see a black-clad figure disappearing down the road at great bounds . Its arms were waving wildly in the air . In the general direction of this industrious figure , Officers Shad and Red were merrily discharging their revolvers . Munson lost no time in reaching the scene of action.  | " Now please tell me , " he said in a tired voice , " just what in God 's name is the meaning of this maddened fusillade ? " " A reporter , " said Red briefly , eying his smoking weapon with approval . " Did he say he was a reporter ? " " He did not , " put in Shad with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . He said he was a preacher . And damned if he was n't disguised like one . White collar and all . Kept insisting on seeing Aunt Matty . Said that with all the sorrow that 's visited the house he thought he 'd drop over and have a little talk with her . But he did n't fool us . Not for a minute . " At this point Officer Red laughed cynically . " No , " he said , " he did n't get away with it . We told him to beat it , and then we pulled our guns and banged away . " " Did you swear at him , perhaps ? " Munson 's voice was almost timid as he put the question . " Did we swear ? " repeated Shad , and rolled his eyes at his brother-in-arms . " Did we swear ? Mr. Munson , you should have heard us . We used every bad word we could think of . He 'll never come back here any more . " Munson 's hand sought his forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh ! " " Anything wrong ? " asked Officer Red solicitously . " No , certainly not , " replied Munson . " Everything 's splendid  --  dandy . " He let his eyes rest on his staff . " Did this man happen to mention any name ? " he asked . " Sure , " said Red promptly . " He called himself the Reverend Williams . Horace Williams in full . " Horace seemed to strike some responsive chord in both of the officers , for at the very mention of the name they started in laughing , and continued for some time with ever-increasing volume . The Rev. Mr. Horace Williams . That was the name of the particular man of God Aunt Matty had been hoping would call . Munson remembered it distinctly . She had been expecting him to tell her just what the world was coming to , and now , no doubt , the Rev. Mr. Williams was wondering about that himself . " Did we do all right , Mr. Munson ? " asked Officer Shad , wiping the tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , " said Munson weakly , " but do n't mention the fact up at the house that you scared the Rev. Mr. Horace Williams out of ten years ' growth . It might get to Aunt Matty 's ears . " " Then it was a real preacher ? " asked Red , his eyes wide . " I 'm very much afraid it was , " Munson smiled faintly . " Gord , " breathed Officer Shad . " And all those words we used . "   MUNSON explained everything , but already everyone'snerves were so finely edged that his words did little to dispel the tension gripping the various members of the household . Aunt Matty retired flutteringly to her room . Sam , Sue , and June sat in a silent group at the far end of the veranda . Without Daniel they seemed to be lost . They missed his cynical voice and his rather grim banter . All of them were thinking of him sitting alone and worried in the hot , unclean village lockup . " How 's he going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular . " He 's much too long . " " Probably wo n't sleep at all , " replied Sam . " He 'll have lots of things to think about . " " Too many things , " said June . " We all have , " said Sam . " Wish I could stop . " " I 've stopped , " announced Sue . " I ca n't think anymore even when I want to . My brain has crumbled . " " He must have done it , June , " Sam 's voice was low , " but damn if I can see why . " " There were plenty of good reasons for killing Lane Holt , " answered June in a dead voice . " I could have done it myself . " Sam nodded his head slowly , then his eyes met those of June for one swift glance . The girl 's gaze dropped to the large solitaire sparkling on her engagement finger . Daniel 's last gift . She wondered if it would ever mean anything now . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm always too late it seems . " " What do you mean by that ? " asked Sue .   " Oh , nothing much , " he answered . " Only , if Lane Holt had to be killed I 'd rather have done it than Dan . " " Do you enjoy murdering people ? " asked his wife , slightly raising her eyebrows . " Must you go sticking your great nose into every murder ? And are you anxious to make a widow out of your own wife , or would you prefer to see me dead at your feet , the victim of your own hand ? " This was a long speech for Sue , and not a very pleasant one under the circumstances . Sam smiled conciliatinglyupon her . " No , Sue , " he said , " but I ca n't bear the thought of Dan sitting alone down there tonight . He 's done a lot for me  --  gone through hell and all . " " Is n't there any hope ? " asked Sue . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's some hope , Sue . " " What ? " " Scott Munson . He 's for Dan in this . " " If he is , " put in Sam , " it 's because he has other plans for Dan . That guy 's going to hang us all , and he does n't need Lane Holt to help him do it , either . " " If you keep on being so cheerful and optimistic , Sam , " said his wife , " I 'm going to start in screaming and pulling my hair out by the roots . " " Even that would be a relief , " remarked June . They sat in silence as the shadows of the trees lengthened and dusk came quietly over the water and gathered round them . The old house was silent now , and in his room Lane Holt was silent , too . But there was no peace . The horror of murder and the fear of death and separation hung on the air . It would soon be night now  --  black night for Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scraping across the floor . But that was only one of his perplexities . He was also thinking of inkstands , threads tied to revolvers , ink-stained fingers , dropped handkerchiefs , and left-handed golf players . They were all a part of the same thought . And occasionallyacross these thoughts bounded the disconcertinglyactive figure of the Rev. Mr. Horace Williams earnestly retreating down the road . An unfortunate occurrence . One after another Munson eliminated the various units composing the structure of his thought , until only the bronze inkstand remained , that and the sound of scraping . Suddenly he sat forward in his chair as if listening , then gradually his body relaxed . " Oh , what an abysmal , rank , noisome novice I have turned out to be , " he told himself . " It has to be there . By all the laws of man and God it ca n't be anywhere else . And I should have known it . It was my job to know . " He rose from his chair and casually collected his staff . The Shays were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weary of looking out for reporters , and were ready to do something else now  --  any old thing . The Shays were fond of change . Routine palled on their vibrant , sensitive natures . " Come with me , " said Munson . " What 's up , chief ? " asked Officer Red . " We 're going to look for an inkstand , " he answered . The staff exchanged significant glances . What a silly occupation for three full-grown men . This Munsonwas mad indeed . Munson led them across the lawn and round the house until they stood directly beneath the side window of the room in which Lane Holt lay dead . Here there was a brick-faced shaft running down against the side of the house about five feet below the surface of the lawn . A boarded-up window was set into the shaft . It opened up into the cellar and was obviously used at one time for purposes of ventilation , but as that section of the cellar was now no longer used neither shaft nor window had any particular reason for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the shaft and saw that it was half filled with several seasons ' accumulation of dead leaves , a direct reflection on the executive ability of Griggs and the enterprise of Tom , his invaluable assistant . " Could n't have been better suited to his purpose if he had dug the hole himself , " soliloquized Munson , as he inspected the shaft . " How dumb I 've been ! It 's a plain case of galloping senility . " IHis inspection finished , he turned to the Shays and considered their unlovely figures . " I imagine you 're better designed for shaft work , Shad , " he said . " Red would fill it up and would n't be able to bend . So just get down in there and do n't come out until you bring an inkstand with you . " " It 's a nasty-looking place , " observed the officer fastidiously . " Might be more than inkstands down there . " " Well , " said Munson , " if you find a body or anything else interesting bring it along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And in went Shad , his hearty disapproval of the entire procedure eloquently marked on his face . " Now grope around in that rubbish and produce an inkstand , " commanded Munson . " With my bare hands ? " asked Shad in a tone of incredulity . " I do n't care if you grope with your teeth , so longP193as I get my inkstand , " replied Munson . " Make it snappy . " " Well , of all the things , " murmured Shad , as he shrinkingly bent to his task . His groping was soon over . Virtually the first object his hand encountered was the heavy bronze inkstand , partially covered with leaves . " Here it is , " he exclaimed with infinite relief , as he passed the stand up to Munson , who received it with a glow of triumph . Round the bronze slab was tied a long piece of string on the free end of which was attached a strand of strong , thin thread . " That pretty well settles it , " said Munson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's work is done . You two had better go back to the kitchen and rustle up some grub . " This suggestion , the officers later agreed , was the only reasonable one they had ever heard Munson make . As they were about to follow it , Red stopped , unable to restrain his curiosity . " Might I ask what you wanted with that old chunk of metal , Mr. Munson ? " he asked . " Nothing much , " replied Munson carelessly . " Just to keep an innocent man from being charged with murder and eventually going to the chair . " With a half-frightened look at the object now safely tucked in the crook of Munson 's arm , the officers tiptoedthrough the darkness on the most cheerful mission of a long and trying day . The inquest into the death of Lane Holt occasioned a wider show of interest than had the one caused by the shocking departure of Emily-Jane . And this hardly seemed fair . Certainly Emily-Jane would have held it against Holt had she been in a position to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault . He had not planned the inquest . The knowledge that Daniel Crewe was being detained pending the verdict of the jury had spread rapidly . The local inhabitants refused to considerthe possibility of his guilt , and they attended the inquest for the sole purpose of showing that fact no matter what nonsense the coroner 's jury might be led to believe . When Daniel appeared in the company of Dr. Manning , a low murmur of voices ran through the long library . Heads were thrust in at the French windows and sympathetic eyes followed the progress . Without any effort on his part Daniel had made himself a popularfigure in the community . The loyalty of the two brothers and their life together at the old Crewe home had long been a subject of interest in many homes . The two of them were much a part of the place , very closely associated with the life of the countryside . Tall and haggard , Daniel sat between June and Manning . He had not slept and his eyes were sunken , but they looked on Coroner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion of the anxiety he felt . He had thought the long night through and still was unable to see how he was going to clear himself of the murder of Lane Holt . There was not a scrap of evidence in his favor . Fate had stacked the cards skilfully against him . For some odd reason his position reminded him of " The Case of Sergeant Grischa . " It was so hopeless and at the same time so useless  --  so tragically inane . At the back of the room Barney at the last moment slid into a seat and found himself dangerously withinP195the influence of the large eyes of one small Sally Brent . Today , however , she contented herself with regarding the crumpled , untidy figure furtively . After the exchange of quick , shy smiles , both pretended the other had gone away . They were not successful at this . Scott Munson had placed himself strategically the better to be able to confer with Coroner Judson , whose methods of procedure were inclined to be informal and rather absent-minded . After Dr. Wood had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lane Holt had died as the result of a bullet from a revolver fired at close range , Judson asked : " Would it have been possible , Dr. Wood , for the deceased to have done it himself ? " " Easily possible , " replied the doctor , " but for two exceptions : the bullet entered the left temple and the revolver was found lying at least twelve feet from the body . Inasmuch as the deceased died instantly he could hardly have so disposed of the gun . Furthermore , a right-handed man would not have shot himself in the left temple . " Dr. Wood stepped down and was followed by SergeantBennett whose story of the shooting was brief but devastating to Daniel . A little after one o'clock in the afternoon while at luncheon he had heard the shot . He had reached the scene so quickly that Daniel Crewe had been unable to escape from the room . This had obviously been his intention , for he , Bennett , had stopped him at the door . Bennett had found in Daniel 's hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement had not been finished . " Is this the statement , sergeant ? " asked the coroner , extending the crumpled sheet of paper . " It is , sir . "
