txt Secret agents who boasted of connections in high official places in the Third Reich stalked yesterday through Guenther Gustav Rumrich 's account of his own bungling espionage efforts as the United States Army deserter and unsuccessful dishwasher continued his testimony against three erstwhile co-defendants charged with pilfering American defense secrets and selling them to Germany . 1 Testifying before Federal Judge John C. Knox and a jury at the 1 trial of Otto Hermann Voss , an air1 plane mechanic ; Erich Glaser , a 1 former soldier at Mitchel Field , and Johanna Hofmann , a hairdresser on the German liner Europa , Rumrich revealed that his own equipment for the career he chose for himself was a stock of souvenirs of his military service and an ability to convince a trustful intelligence officer in Hamburg that some day he would make good on his promises . Spectators Are Amused The spectators who filled the big courtroom leaned forward to catch every word uttered by the funereal looking Rumrich , whose sepulchral voice carried hardly beyond the juror farthest from the witness chair . Occasionally a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court attendants , when Rumrich unsmilingly revealed the - insignificance of his contributions to German military intelligence . There was a serious aspect to his recital , too , but most of what Rumrich had to tell of this nature was obtained at second-hand , and it was almost impossible to learn from his recital where fiction ended and fact began . What with the hdcus pocus and the double-dealing intrigue that he described there were few clues to who was deceiving whom . Rumrich said he concocted a story about a scheme to obtain aviation secrets from Governors Island and requested x$100 extra for expenses of a " fictitious " woman character he invented for the occasion . Says He Never Got Money The mysterious Sanders who began writing to him after Rumrich volunteered his services assured Rumrich that the money had been forwarded to him , he said . Rumrich , however , never received it , and the best - he ever - could - ascertain was that ' it was rumored that an intermediary to whom the money was entrusted . in Germany had made off with the cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not as gullible as other testimony would seem to indicate . Meanwhile , however , German agents constantly were urging Rumrich on to greater efforts and encouraging him with tales of high rewards they- said were paid to more productive spies . These emissaries from the German Military Intelligence , who masked their real activities behind humble jobs on German ships , were a colorful set of- characters as Rumrich described them . There was " Schmidt , " first name unknown , who found fault with Rumrich 's modest Bronx apartment be-% cause there were too many " Jews and Communists " in the neighborhood . Other secret agents lived in more " refined " surroundings , Schmidt said , and mentioned one who lived at Riverside Drive near 101st Street . It was Schmidt who got tipsy on Scotch and soda at Maxi 's in East Eighty-sixth Street one night and showed Rumrich an envelope containing two $1,000 bills for a spy in Brooklyn , who had stolen some plans from the Sperry Gyroscope plant , he asserted . Told of Embassy Visit Then there was Theodore Wiegand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before their meeting he had spent at the German Embassy in Washington with Fritz Weidemann , personal adjutant to Adolf Hitler , and produced a photograph to support his statement , Rumrich expressed surprise . that diplomats - found it expedient to consult with " people in our line , " but Wiegand assured him that a new crop of diplomats had arisen in Germany since the advent of National Socialism . Wiegand , in a clumsy moment , dropped a pistol out of his pocket while putting on his coat in a cafeteria near the Hotel Taft one night , but Rumrich said he pretended not to notice as the embarrassed intelligence officer picked it up . Last of all there was Karl Schlueter , a traveling deputy of Udo von Bonin of the German War Ministry , wht brought Miss Hofmann to call on Rumrich and his wife one night and identified her as an agent " well known to the Bureau of Messages , " he declared . Schlueter , who said he had just handed over $2,000 to an agent who had stolen Important plans from the Curtiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which he hoped Rumrich would find answers . The best the harassed deserter from the army , then earning $22.50 a week as a translator for a chemical company , could do was to dig his old album from a trunk and tell Schlueter to help himself . The emissary from Germany looked it over , the witness said , and selected two pictures of ships passing through the Panama Canal . Rumrich said he had purchased one of them in a store in Colon while he was stationed there . Always Wanted Something The major objective of the visitors from Germany seemed to be to take something home with them , and on-one occasion when Rumrich had nothing whatever to offer he was prevailed upon to write a note promising results in the future . ' The things Schleuter was really most Interested in getting , Rumrich testified , were blank seamen 's ' passes and passport blanks . The ' latter , Schleuter confided , would I facilitate the entry of German agents into Russia . For these Schleuter offered $5 apiece , Rumrich said . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posing as an official of the State Department , that led. to his own arrest and brought the whole conspiracy down upon the heads of the conspirators . Long before that , however , the British and American Governmentsknew about the existence of the spy ring , for letters addressed to Miss Jessie Jordan at 1 Kenlock Street , Dundee , Scotland , were being opened , photographed and then sent on by inspectors of the British postal service . Miss Jordan now is serving a four-year sentence in England for espionage . Rumrich was advised by Sanders to send information to him through Miss Jordan , he said , after several months of corresponding direct to Hamburg . He was told also , if he was caught , to say he was working for Great Britain under a Major Christopher Draper , Rumrich said . Lester C. Duniga.n , an assistant to United States Attorney Lamar Hardy , interrupted his questioning of Rumrich at the opening of the afternoon session to read into the record the reports of British postal inspectors who intercepted the mail addressed to Miss Jordan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were graphically described by Rumrich at many points in his narrative . For instance , there was his first meeting with Schmidt , who called him up on the telephone one day and ordered Rumrich to meet him in the " first booth of the White . House-Restaurant , " between Si-01 way and Seventh Avenue on Thirtysixth Street . When Rumrich arrived he found the appointed booth occupied by two women sipping tea . They continued to sip until long after the time for the rendezvous , and it was a month before he established contact with Schmidt , who gave him $50 . Rumrich 's next difficulty are over his first meeting with Wiegand , who had sent a messenger to the inept agent while Rumrich and his wife were at the movies . The messenger had left with Glaser , who was living at the time with the Rumrich 's , a carefully . drawn plan of the lobby of the Hotel Taft with an " X " marking the spot where Wiegand would be sitting at 6 o'clock the following evening . Wiegand said he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIMES . " To Rumrich 's consternation upon his arrival he found two men sitting in the spot marked on the plan of the lobby and both were reading THE Taw . Rumrich asked the wrong man if he was Mr. Wiegand , and Wiegand who was seated next to the stranger jumped up and said : " Let 's get out of here . " Cross Street to Cafeteria Wiegand and . Rumrich crossed the street to the cafeteria , where he clumsily dropped his pistol . There Wiegand gave Rumrich an envelope containing the customary $50 and a letter which he advised Rumrich to read in the washroom . The letter instructed Rumrich to be careful and to send any letters not dispatched by hand to Miss Jordan at the address in Dundee . On the occasion of the cafeteria conference , Rumrich said , Wiegand asked if he did not have " something to send back . " Rumrich said the meeting had been so unexpected that he was unprepared . Wiegand prevailed upon him at least to write a note to Sanders , and Rumrich did so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobby which Wiegand had drawn for him . After that the plotters parted , Wiegand going to a newsreel theatre to " listen to the applause . " That question about sending " something back " plagued Rumrich almost every time the Europa or the Hamburg docked and sent ashore representatives of Sanders . Rumrich 's usual answer was that he did not have anything at the time , but was working on leads that he hoped would produce important results . Every now and then , however , he tried to carry out the simpler assignments he received . One of these was a request for army and navy catalogues . These he obtained , as any one else might have done , Rumrich said , by writing to the Government Printing Office for them . Even that did not please Sanders much , for he wrote saying that Rumrich was too slow about it . On another occasion when he was hard pressed for something to send to Germany as a token of his diligence he excavated from the mementos of his military service " a couple of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with " extended order drill " and the other had to do with military sanitation . One of the photographs was an aerial view of Manila and the other a snapshot of some troops on the parade ground of a Canal Zone fort , Rumrich recalled . Rumrich 's narrative consumed the whole court day . His direct examination had not been completed when Judge Knox adjourned court until 10:30 A. M. today .
