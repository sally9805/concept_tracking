RAILROADMAN-Chauncey Del French - Macmillan ( $2.50 ) . <P> Henry Clay French was an orphan who got a job as callboy on the Hannibal &; St. Joe Railroad in Kansas City back in 1873 . Learning telegraphy in his spare time , he was a full-fledged operator at 14 , a combined telegrapher and brakeman on the Santa Fe three years later . For the next 50 years he was shunted from line to line like a boxcar in a busy season . He saw hard living in Kansas cow towns , hard drinking at Northwest division points , hard work everywhere . Last week his son , a brakeman himself , offered Harry French 's biography as a typical story of a last-generation American workman . <P> Railroadman recalls the flavor of Casey Jones or The Wreck of the Old 97 . It tells of railroading in the days before air brakes and automatic couplers-when there was no standard-gauge track ; when engines were thrown into reverse to bring them to a sudden stop ; when railroadmen were the true aristocrats of labor , with something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French was in wrecks on the Lawrence , Leavenworth &; Galveston ( known as the Lazy , Lousy and Greasy ) , on the Union Pacific , the Northern Pacific , the Tacoma Eastern , the Oregon Railroad &; Navigation , missed wrecks by a hair on half-a-dozen other lines . In those days grades were so steep over the Cascade Mountains that when a dispatcher wired a telegraph operator in the mountains , asked if a runaway stock train had passed through , the reply became a classic : " Roar of wheels . Smell of manure . Yes . " Harry French 's biggest railroad wreck came when a bridge gave way as the locomotive passed over it , dropped the caboose in which he was riding 40 feet into a flooded river , killing nine men and injuring 26 . <P> But his worst wreck was the smashup of his first marriage which came when he had three children . A hard drinker , suspicious , temperamental , French became jealous of a young boarder , accused his wife of infidelity , made the boarder dance at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went through a kind of proletarian purgatory : jobs slipped through his fingers , money went for liquor , strikes got him in trouble , his daughters by his second wife died . Moroseness drove him to unforgivable railroad sins : abandoning his train in the middle of a run ; deliberately tying up traffic until three freights and two passenger trains were stalled at one station . His growing sons cured him of that ; he worked his way back to respectability as a brakeman on the Union Pacific , retired on his pension of one dollar a day . Humorless in its domestic episodes , woodenly written except for pages of authentic railroad talk , Railroadman is nevertheless a first-rate U. S. document , the best picture going of an old-time rank &; file member of the powerful Railroad Brotherhoods.
