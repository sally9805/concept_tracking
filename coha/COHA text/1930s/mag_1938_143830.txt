Sporty Cortlandt T. Hill , 31-year-old , stockbroking grandson of the late great Railroader James Jerome Hill , was skiing down hills at Sun Valley , Idaho , last week with his host , Railroader W. Averell Harriman . Between slides he tried to interest the Union Pacific 's able board chairman not in some of his stocks but in his two new railroad cars . <P> Back in Inglewood , Calif . Cortlandt Hill had a pair of plywood passenger cars which resembled ordinary units of a streamlined duralumin train , but which were mounted on their running gear in a manner which he and several partners claimed was brand-new for railroad cars . Invented by William Van Dorn and Dr. F. C. Lindvall of California Institute of Technology , who have been working on the cars for the past two years in an abandoned Northrup Aviation hangar , the coaches are sprung on a " pendulum " principle by which four heavy vertical coil springs above each of the car 's four axles fit into pockets in the body of the car ( see cut ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's low centre of gravity , the tendency of the body roll on curves is inward instead of outward as on an ordinary car . Airplane fashion , the car banks into the curve , vastly increasing both comfort and steadiness . Lateral and horizontal restraint of the body is achieved by rubberized links between the inside end of the trucks and the lower portion of the car 's body . Result is a full-size passenger coach whose floor is 30 in. above the rails instead of 4 ft. ; whose roof is u ft. instead of 14 ft. high . Weight , if made of duralumin , is 50,000 Ib. - 40% less than present streamlined cars . <P> Most interested railroad in the experimental coaches is Santa Fe , which loaned ten miles of sidetrack and , an engine for the trial runs . To show them to other U. S. roads the designers plan to install two Ford V-8 engines to enable the coaches to cruise about the country under their own power . Delighted with the steadiness of the coaches during tests at 50 m.p.h. , Sponsor Hill-whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern shops at St. Paul during childhood-pronounced his cars " jounce-less. "
