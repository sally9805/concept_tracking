Overtime is only a figure of speech in Germany these days . Recently Marshal Hermann Goring appointed Efficiency Expert Paul Walther to investigate the coal industry : the men were digging less coal on ten-hour shifts than they had previously dug on eight . Working hours for men have been pushed up until two twelve-hour shifts have been reached in some industries . Men returning from work on the Siegfried Line say that they were driven 15 hours a day-from dawn to dark , with two short rests . <P> Contrary to the trend was a law which <P> Minister of Labor Franz Seldte put into effect last week . Women , decreed Minister Seldte , must not be made to work more than ten hours a day , 54 hours a week . Nazi Seldte 's reason : " Women must have plenty of time for their natural profession , motherhood . "
