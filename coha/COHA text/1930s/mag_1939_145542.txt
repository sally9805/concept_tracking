Last week labor unions loomed large among matters discussed at a Catholic Conference on Industrial Problems in Detroit . One of the great U. S. Catholic leaders , Detroit 's Archbishop Edward Mooney , warned the conferees that " religious leaders in the present struggle between Americanism and Communism for the control of labor . . . must make Christian principles articulate " or " they will have to share their responsibility in the debacle that ensues . " <P> Next day , to make his own principles articulate , Archbishop Mooney summoned all the 542 priests of his archdiocese-including one whose parish work is something of a side line , and whose love for labor is not great , Rev. Charles Edward ( " Silo Charlie " * ) Coughlin . As a starter in helping " Christian workers to train themselves in principle and technique to assume the leadership in the unions which their numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such schools , he said , might " sift the good from the bad in labor proposals , and be the defenders of sound , constructive union activity against . . . Communistic agitation . " <P> <P> *So nicknamed because his Charity Crucifixion Tower reminds many Detroiters of a silo.
