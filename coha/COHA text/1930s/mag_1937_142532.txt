To the desk of overworked Dr. Hjalmar Schacht , president of the Reichsbank and Minister of Economics , there came last week a neatly typed memorandum signed by the presidents of a dozen large mortgage banks . The Nazi Government , they complained , scrabbling for every pfennig to pay for its fabulous armament program , has practically taken over their entire capital , making it impossible for them to issue mortgage loans , their chief source of income . If this practice is not stopped , some of the mortgage banks will be forced to close . <P> Because Adolf Hitler has long understood that he can not do without miraculous Dr. Schacht , who alone seems to be capable of keeping German economy from falling apart , left-wing Nazis have given up their attempts to boot him out of office . Dr. Schacht in turn has learned not to annoy Nazi extremists unduly . He had the memorandum mimeographed , sent copies to Nazi bigwigs , other bankers , manufacturers , without comment other than a request for their personal opinions . That done Dr. Schacht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was elaborately welcomed by King Leopold , the Governor of the National Bank of Belgium and Premier Paul van Zeeland . <P> Dr. Schacht had a fine offer in his briefcase , but Premier van Zeeland , pleasantly aglow after his thumping electoral victory last fortnight over Belgium 's No. 1 Fascist , Lon Degrelle ( TIME , April 19 ) , was in no mood to give anything away to the Fascists from across the Rhine . Germany is starving for raw materials ; the Belgian Congo is one of the richest properties in Africa . Dr. Schacht 's scheme was that Germany should buy $84,250,000 worth of Congo copper , tin and oil , pay for it within a specified time with thermometers , automobiles , safety razors , cameras , et al . One potent group in Belgium hailed this scheme with delight , for as special inducement Dr. Schacht was willing to have all the Congo imports carried in Belgian freighters . Catch to all this is that Belgian manufacturers are opposed to seeing their country flooded with German manufactured goods . Premier van Zeeland listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to consider it worth their while to talk with us as equals , now that we are again armed and powerful , " frankly said Hjalmar Schacht to Belgian reporters . <P> Just as frank on his return to Munich , Dr. Schacht admitted the reason for his offer : the Four-Year Plan ( to make Germany self-sufficient ) is doomed to failure . <P> " The raw material restrictions now have surpassed their peak , " said he . " Our food situation has shown that we can not become independent of foreign imports within a calculable time . . . . These decisions have been made in complete accord with General Gring , who heads the Four- Year Plan . "
