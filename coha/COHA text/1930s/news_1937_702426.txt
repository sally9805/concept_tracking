Meantime , Chicago reported that major domestic airlines ' passenger traffic so far this month has gained sharply over a year ago . Weather Is chiefly responsible for this pickup .

CHICAGO  --  With weather conditions more nearly normal this month , and considerably more favorable than in January , passenger traffic on major domestic airlines has picked up importantly and is running well ahead of a year aco . Last month the industry had to contend with probably the worst period of adverse flying weather in its history and cancellations were heavy . As a result traffic showed a more than seasonal decline from December . although still showing a gain over year before . During January revenue passenger miles flown by the industry showed an increase of 10.5% over a year earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1936 . The decline last month from December was 47.8% against 16.6% last year . Up to last month traffic had resisted the usual seasonal decline and November was the best month in the industry 's history . American Shows- 128% Gain On the basis of figures for February available at this date , American Airlines is showing the sharpest gain over a year ago . In the first 19 days of this month company carries 43% more passengers than in the like period in Janu ary and 128% more than in the same period a year ago . Final figures for the month are expected to show an increase of approximately 50% over January . Last month American made a somewlbat better showing than the industry as a whole , carrying 37% more passengers than in January . 1936. this in the face of heavier cancellations than in any other month in its history . During the month American completed only 66% of scheduled flights compared with 80% year ago and around 95% for the full year 1936 . The sharper gain shown by American apparently was due in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more modern equipment than at this time last year . Adverse weather conditions probably affected a smaller portion of its system than that of its competitors . TWA Traffic Increases Transcontinental &; Western . Air this month is enjoying about as good a pick-up over January as American . In the first 20 days of February , TWA flew 2.484,298 revenue passenger miles compared with 2,352,064 in all of January . However , TWA 's traffic last month was off about 30% from a year ago . If the daily average for the last eight days of the month comes up to that for the first 20 days , company 's total for February would approximate 3,500,000 miles or 50% better than in January . In February last year TWA flew 3,471,227 revenue passenger miles . On United Airlines no figures for the entire system for the first 20 days of February are available yet . In the first ten days , however , its traffic was running slightly ahead of the same period in January . Last month United did a larger volume than a year ago , its traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the month . Revenue passengers carried by United out of Chicago only in the first 19 days of this month showed an increase of 28% over a year ago and of approximately 15% over January . The following tabulation illustrates the effect the proposed changes would have on the rates on the five routes , assuming the present schedules and set-up : The loss on Route 21 would result from the elimination of certain schedules between Boston and Albany and Cleveland and Buffalo rather than from the actual changes proposed . The company , however , is being compensated on other routes for these eliminations . Extra Flights a Possibility The increases in base mileage proposed would make possible additional schedules on some of the routes For example , the increase m mileage on Route 4 from 160,000 to 240.000 would allow exactly for an additional round trip daily between Dallas and Los Angeles . TWO round trips now are being operated . The actual mileage now being flown monthly on the respective routes is as follows : Route 4. 163.459 miles ; Route 21 , 59.087 miles ; Route 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Route 30 , 71,120 miles . The examiners ' report stated that the financial loss sustained by the company is not controlling In the determination of fair and reasonable rates . A large part of the loss , it was said . has been due to the low rates at which the company originally bid for the transportation of mail on some of the routes . The examiners ' report says that in making its findings its considerations included " the losses from petitioner 's operations , the trend of improvement in non-mail revenues , the potentialities of the new flying equipment petitioners has undertaken to install in operation , and the amount of service without compensation contributed by petitioner to the improvement of the air-mail service . " Mail Pay Raise Urged WASHINGTON  --  Revision of ease rates of pay and allotted mileage on five airmail contract routes of American Airlines . which , on the present schedules , would result in pay increases totaling approximately $186.000 a year . was recommended to the Interstate Commerce Commission yesterday in a report proposed by examiners of the commission 's airmail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted , would be retroactive to March 9 , 1936 , indicating approximately a year 's each pay at the present time in addition to the future increases . The ICC previously has approved pay rate readjustments for the airmail contractors , notably in the case of Northwest Airlines Inc . Nearly a year ago , the Commission approved a new scale of rates which , being made retroactive , left the Post Office Department owing Northwest Airlines approximately $100,000 . This , together with other readjustments in mail pay made by the ICC occasioned the need of a deficiency appropriation in the current fiscal year . Such an appropriation was obtained when on February 8 the $949,000,000 Deficiency Appropriation Bill was passed . In this bill there was an allotment of $984,000 for the Post Office Department to cover these air mail pay readjustments . In the Treasury-Post Office Appropriation Bill for the 1938 fiscal year , still under consideration , the airmail appropriation amounts to 614,250,000 , which is an increase of $2,250,000 over the 1937 fiscal year appropriation . This increase is to take care of future pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . American Airlines , the largest domestic transport operator , operates eight mail contract routes . The examiners suggested no changes for Routes 7 and 25. running from New York to Chicago . and Washington to Chicago , on which the base rate is now 331/2 cents per airplane mile . With respect to Route 18 from New York to Boston , the examiner held that the rate was fair and reasonable and provided a sufficient return to the company . The base rate on that route is now 31 cents . Recommend Following Changes The examiners recommended the following changes : Route 4 , reduce base pay from 26 to 25 cents , increase base mileage from 160,000 to 240,000 ; Route 21 , increase base rate from 32 to 3314 cents ; Route 22 , increase base rate from 28 to 32 cents and increase mileage from 50,000 to 60,000 ; Route 23 , reduce base rate from 28 to 23 cents but increase mileage from 85,000 to 340,000 ; and Route 30 , reduce base rate from 28 to 25 cents and increase mileage from 55,000 to 140,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fact that the rate increases progressively one-cent for each 10% decrease in mileage flown . Hence , by increasing base mileage without altering schedules , pay increases ranging from 1 to 5 cents will result from the proposals .
