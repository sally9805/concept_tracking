" Pistols , Rifles , Bullets " <P> In a San Juan , Puerto Rico courtroom last month two middle-aged men amiably reminisced of their undergraduate days at Harvard . One was Colonel Amos Walter Wright Woodcock , onetime ( 1930-33 ) director of the U. S. Bureau of Prohibition . The other was frail , voluble Pedro Albizu y Campos , President of Puerto Rico 's small , explosive Nationalist Party . Lawyer Woodcock 's job was to prosecute Lawyer <P> Albizu and seven of his followers on charges of : 1 ) attempting to overthrow the U. S. Government by force ; 2 ) fomenting violence ; 3 ) trying to recruit an army of independence . As defense counsel for himself and followers , Harvardman Albizu , half-white , half-black , was out to give Harvardman Woodcock the lie . Though there was ample testimony that Albizu had , by inflammatory speeches , blown the lid off the island 's political teakettle , and indirectly provoked the murder of Insular Police Chief Elisha Francis Riggs last winter ( TIME , March 2 et seq. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last week , exactly 38 years after the first entry of U. S. troops into Puerto Rico , a second trial on the same charges started . Special U. S. Prosecutor Woodcock read excerpts from La Palabra ( The Word ) , Nationalist Party organ . Sample : " Arm yourselves , arm yourselves , arm yourselves ; pistols , pistols , pistols ; rifles , rifles , rifles ; bullets , bullets , bullets ; dynamite , dynamite , dynamite ; find there , Puerto Ricans , the sole truth of today and tomorrow . " Not a bit dismayed by these readings , the eight defendants blandly denied any hostility towards the U. S. But in his summation next day Defendant Albizu , overcome by patriotic fervor , suddenly declared that he was more than willing to use force if the U. S. refused to withdraw peaceably from the island . That apparently convinced the jury that Albizu was a dangerous man . Found guilty on all three charges , he was sentenced to ten years in Atlanta Penitentiary . Guilty also on all counts were the Party 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Yankee imperialism ! " shrieked a crowd of Nationalists outside the courtroom . <P> New York 's pinko Representative Vito Marcantonio , who has many Puerto Ricans in his Manhattan constituency , took immediate charge of the Nationalists ' appeal .
