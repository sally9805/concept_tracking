Only one copy of the budget as adopted was made available for the press by the board 's secretary . Newbold Morris , president of the City Council , who engaged in a sharp clash Thursday with Park Commissioner Robert Moses over the Circumferential Parkway , said he would continue to press for transfer of the parkway funds to new school construction in Brooklyn and the Bronx . Mr. Moses 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than $1,000,000 of the $5,000,000 cut being made on park projects . Lyons Urges Subway Fund James J. Lyons , Borough President of the Bronx , championed an allocation of $3,754,980 for the subway extension in his borough after a large number of Bronx residents had appeared to plead for it . The amount is less than the $5,000,000 originally set aside , but Mr. Lyons was confident that a good start could be obtained on the extension with the amount he asked for . When Mrs. Jacob Schechter , head of the United Parents Association , asked additional funds for schools , Borough President Raymond V.

" When a public official realizes he has made a mistake , " Mr. Morris said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He can either attempt to justify it for the rest of his life , or he can attempt to rectify it , if it is not too late . I believe that with the city 's present financial condition , where you have in 1940 practically zero for new improvements and in 1941 only about $15 , - 000,000 , and with the city 's debt- incurring capacity very slim , it Is a serious situation . " There are two ways to meet that problem  --  either by impairing the margin of safety , or by looking around for new funds . The Circumferential Parkway is one of the obvious outstanding examples that involve expenditure of the city 's funds . In good faith , I asked yesterday for an investigation for the reallocation of these funds . What I did was not easy . It is easier to attempt to justify it for the rest of your life than to walk into a hornet 's nest and trade brickbats with the Park Commissioner . " It was not apparent until the capital outlay budget hearings had begun that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my choice . I am sorry I was late and I have done my best to rectify the mistake . " Mr. Ingersoll said the only business properly before the board . was the adoption of the budget . He said a vote on Mr. Morris 's proposal would constitute an expression of opinion by the board that it wished to upset the program already laid down . He explained that the city had already acquired land for the parkway , that $5,000,000 in contracts had been let and that the city had an agreement on it with the Federal Government . If Mr. Morris wanted the investigation , he said the Mayor or Controller Joseph D. could make it without action by the board . Stanley M. Isaacs , Manhattan Borough President , said he agreed with Mr. Morris that the parkway was a luxury which could well have been postponed .
