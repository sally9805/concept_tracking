txt Prompted by a situation in which the treasury deficit mounted today to nearly $400,000,000 for the first sixtytwo days of the fiscal year , with the prospect of an increase in the budget , President Hoover 's supporters in Congress hope to make telling slashes in expenditures for the army and navy , in an endeavor to avoid a tax increase . The treasury 's daily statement indicated that the government has spent since July , $396,365,000 more than it has received . If this rate continues , it means a deficit of more than $2,000,000,000 , although a season of unusual receipts would mean a substantial offset . The deficit for the current fiscal year previously had been estimated at around $1,500,000 , or about $600,000 , - 000 more than that of the fiscal year 1930-31 ending June 30 . The aim of the President 's supporters as to . army and navy economies was indicated by Representative Will R. Wood , chairman of the House Appropriations Committee , whose word has been law on most of the **27;798;TOOLONG by the committee for several years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organize the next Congress . For Cuts In Farm Board Outlay . " We are not at war , and we are by no means threatened with war , " Mr. Wood said as he came from a conference with President Hoover . " There is no need for a big navy and there is no need for a , big army . We can reduce the appropriations for both these , two services as well as the Farm Board , and thus go a long way toward balancing the budget . " Mr. Wood 's Statement was seized upon with interest heightened by the reports current yesterday that the administration is in a dilemma as to its fiscal program . While it was learned yesterday that Mr. Hoover and his official advisers had not exactly closed the door against an up . ward tax revision if later it should be deemed necessary , Mr. Wood was of the opinion that tax increases can be averted if rigid economies are invoked . He expressed , casually , a disagreement with the floating of a longterm bond issue of $800,000,000 by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a hope , that a revival of business would obviate the necessity of saddling the expense d the depression on future generations , A complete revision of the Federal taxing system appeared today as the most important fiscal problem facing the government and one which must be met within the next two years , The opinion existed in administration circles , however , that the task is too far-reaching and too intricate to make possible a proposal at the December session of Congress . 1928 Act Admittedly Inadequate . Admittedly , the 1928 revenue act ie not adequate to meet the requirements of the government in periods of depression , since it is the income tax loss particularly that has reduced government revenues . The opinion is expressed in many quarters that the taxation base must be broadened , and the burden of operating the government spread over a greater number of persons . Fears already are entertained that income tax revenue will fall to $1,4p0,300,000 or less in the present fiscal year , as compared with $1,860 , - 000,000 in the fiscal year 1931 , and $2,410,900,000 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes will be the lowest since 1917 . A little less than half of the taxes are derived from individuals , the rest coming from corporations . Mellon 's Speech Is Recalled . Secretary Mellon outlined the position of the government as to tax matters last May when he broadcast his views over the radio . At that time , he said : " The situation in which we find ourselves at present , with a serious deficit facing us at the end of the year , raises the question as to whether we have yet developed a sufficiently well-balanced system to provide the revenues on which the government must be able to count from year to year . " After pointing out that customs duties are fairly stable , and that the tax on tobacco is a dependable source of revenue , Mr. Mellon called attention to the fact " the individual income tax has become a class rather than a general tax , with its incidence limited to a comparatively small number of taxpayers . " He said that some 300,000 individuals pay about 97 per cent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasury has for some time been aware of the defects in our tax structure , " Mr. Mellon continued . " And while , n my opinion , we could not possibly have anticipated the extent to which revenues have fallen off , the treasury has not failed to call to , the attention of Congress and the country the advisability of providing safeguards against the very conditions which have overtaken us . " Three years ago , when Congress was being urged by organizations of business men and other individuals to grant a greater reduction of taxes than seemed warranted , the treasury pointed out the danger of eliminating certain , excise taxes and depending for so large a part of our reVdnue on a comparatively small number of taxpayers . " I have referred to these views at this time , first , because they seem to be pertinent now when the tax system must come under careful scrutiny ; and , second , because I do not wish the country to think that the treasury views with complacence the present ? situation in which we find ourselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure , or the inadequate amount of revenue which it produces under adverse conditions . " Rate of Outlay and Income . Figures for the first two months of the present fiscal year disclosed general fund receipts amounting to $230,399,000 , a . reduction of only $11,000,000 , while general expenditures were $626,764,000 , an increase of $144,000,000 . Income taxes for July and August amounted to $46,579,000 , a reduction of $9,000 ; 000 . During this period , however , there are no important tax collections . The big initial test in income taxes for the fiscal year will develop in the collections due on Sept. 15 . Miscellaneous internal revenue collections in July and August of $95 , - 197,000 , a reduction of $14,000,000 , indicated that the tobacco taxes are holding up well as compared with last year . Customs collections were $72,719,000 , an increase of $14,000,000 . In July and August , 1930 . Customs collections were unusually low because of the fact that in June of that year there had been heavy imports to avoid the higher rates of the 1930 Tariff Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in expenditures in July and August was in part due to an increased outlay for the governmental construction program . Operation of the government departments , including the building program , cost $482,052,000 for the two months , an increase of $111,000,000 . The postal deficiency was $20,000,000 , as compared with $10,004,000 in the same two months last year , while expenditures of the Federal Farm Board amounted to $62,525,000 , as against $15,994,000 .
