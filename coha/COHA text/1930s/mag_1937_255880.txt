The civil war in Spain is " the nerve centre of international politics " according to British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden last week , and on this theory it was arranged to window dress the opening of Parliament in London ( see p. 25 ) with a British diplomatic victory scored in the London International Committee on Non-intervention in Spain . <P> Window-Dressers Benito Mussolini and Neville Chamberlain have been intimately corresponding for months ( TIME , Aug. 9 ) . It was clearly no accident that the Italian Premier suddenly agreed last week to a British scheme of July 14 which had seemed as dead as Queen Anne . Spade-bearded Italian Ambassador Dino Grandi , on orders from Rome , brought the moribund Non-intervention Committee to life by making this " concession ' ' to the British last week in concert with the German Delegate , Dr. Ernst Woermann - for Adolf Hitler had also suddenly discovered that he no longer objects to the British scheme of July 14 . <P> Exactly what this scheme was has been more or less forgotten , and the Committee members floundered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France willing to put through an immediate , unanimous agreement . The Scheme : <P> 1 ) A few thousand of the foreigners now fighting in Spain shall withdraw from the Rightist and also from the Leftist side ; 2 ) After these " token withdrawals , " commissioners dispatched by the Non-intervention Committee shall ascertain with fair accuracy the numbers of interventionists , this with a view to the ultimate withdrawal of all in " progressive and proportional " stages ; 3 ) When the Nonintervention Committee finds these large-scale withdrawals have reached a " substantial " total , the Great Powers are to grant full belligerent rights to the Rightist Government and to the Leftist Government . <P> With this scheme sufficiently advanced for the London Committee to be all smiles and cordiality for the first time in months , only Soviet Ambassador Ivan Maisky darkling , Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain told Britain 's newly-met House of Commons : 1 ) That he believes the " idea " that Italy intends to hold the Balearic Islands after the Spanish war is over to be " unfounded " ; 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith " Italian assurances that Italy has " no territorial or strategic or even economic designs on Spain . " Pointing to Premier Mussolini 's consent to adopt the British scheme of July 14 and immediately make " token withdrawals " of Italians from Spain as evidence of the Tightness of these conclusions , the Prime Minister voiced his own pious hope that the last volunteer will soon be withdrawn . He then asked a vote of confidence on the foreign policy of His Majesty 's Government and won 204-to-111.
