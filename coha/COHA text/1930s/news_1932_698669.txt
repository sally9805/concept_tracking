txt The removal of Sheriff James A. of Brooklyn , former Register of Kings County , whose bank deposits in seven years exceeded his salary by about $40 , p , 000 , was asked yesterday by the City Affairs Committee in a communication sent to Governor Roosevelt . The request for the removal was predicated upon the Governor 's decision in removing Thomas M. Farley as Sheriff of New York County because he had not satisfactorily explained his large deposits . Before the Hofstadter legislative committee testified he had borrowed most of the money " from Peter to pay Paul " and , incidentally , to keep fed and clothed the thirty-three who were his relatives . The money , he said , was thus kept in constant circulation , flowing in and out of his bank account , which accounted for the large deposits . The City Affairs Committee charged that this was as inadequate an explanation as was Farley 's ' of the " wonderful tin box " out of which he drew the funds he had deposited . , 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disclosures of his bank account had been made by Samuel Seabury , counsel to the legislative committee , he ran for Sheriff in Brooklyn and was elected . , his friends and advisers regarded this as a stamp of approval placed by the voters upon the Register 's borrowing activities . The City Affairs Committee discounted this view on the ground that he was , " legally and morally the same man in his new office that he was in his old . " TEXT OF REMOVAL PLEA . The text of the removal petition follows : To His Excellency the Governor of the State of New York : Pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution and statutes of the State of New York , in such case made and provided , the undersigned , John Haynes Holmes , chairman , and Stephen S. Wise , vice chairman , of the City Affairs Committee of New York , both being citizens and residents of the city of New York , do hereby make the following charges against James A. , Sheriff of the county of Kings : I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kings , did make bank deposits during the period of Jan. 1 , 1925 , to the date of his examination before the joint legislative committee Oct. 7 , 1931 , in the total amount of $510,597.35 . Of this amount , $47,077.64 were salary checks , $114,323.05 were other checks and $349,196.66 were cash deposits . During the period named , Mr. had no other sources of income other than his salary ( see transcript of testimony before joint legislative committee , pp. 1145 , 1176 ) , and he was unable to give any reasonable or credible explanation for the remainder of the deposits in the total amount of 5463,519 , with the exception of $31,000 which Mr. claimed he had borrowed from named persons . ( See transcript of testimony , pp. 1169 , 1179 . ) LT . That , as to the deposits other than salary checks , Mr. offered as an explanation that they represented a series of deposits and withdrawals in connection with loans which he was forced to make in order to support thirty-three poverty-stricken members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in deposits totaling $463,519 . Mr. was unable to remember the names of the persons from whom these slims were borrowed : with the exception of two loans totaling $31,000 , he kept no accounts , gave , aLo security for any of the loans , bad no notes , documents or writ : ings of any sort to prove that the loans were made , and offered no corroborating evidence of any sort . ( See transcript of testimony , pp. 1162-83 . ) III . That by reason of his failure to give a satisfactory or credible explanation of large bank deposits in excess of his salary over a period of more than six years , Mr. is unworthy of the public trust , is art unfit person to hold public office and he should , therefore , cease to be an incumbent of the office of Sheriff of Kings County . Wherefore , your petitioners respectfully request that your Excellency , acting under the powers vested in you by the Constitution and statutes of  --  the State , remove from the office of Sheriff of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HOLMES . STEPHEN S. WISE . New York , Friday , March 25 , 1932 . Roosevelt 's Decree Quoted . In a letter which accompanied the petition , Mr. Holmes and Rabbi Wise quoted to the Governor parts of his own decision in the Farley case . Part of the citation read : " As a ' matter of sound public policy I am very certain that there is a requirement that where a public official is under inquiry or investigation , especially an elected official , and it appears that his scale of living or the total of his bank deposits far exceeds the public salary which he is known to receive , he , the elected public official , owes a positive public duty to the community to give a reasonable or credible explanation of the sources of the deposits , or the source which enables him to maintain a I scale of living beyond his salary . " Passive acquiescence by unthinking people in the actions of those who shrewdly turn to personal advantage the opportunities offered by public service is out of step with modern ideals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be excused because it is accompanied by the respondent 's popularity of person and great public generosity . Public office should inspire private financial integrity . " Ask Rule Be Applied . " We beg you to note that this statement was made by your Excellency , " the petitioners wrote , " not as uniquely applying to the case of Sheriff Parley , but as a principle of public policy , to be applied generally , in the interests of honest government and true democracy to all servants of the people . It was offered by you on your own initiative , as a standard to be rigorously applied to all cases revealing such a betrayal of- public trust as that exemplified by Sheriff Farley . " Such a case we are now presenting to you in the charges filed herewith against Sheriff . The latter , exactly like the former , was a witness before the Hofstadter committee . Sheriff , like Sheriff Farley , under cross-examination by Judge Seabury , was forced to reveal the depositing of large sums of money in excess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every opportunity by his questioner , failed utterly to give-a credible explanation of the sources of his swollen income . " On the contrary , like his notorious colleague , he resorted to fantastic explanations of such extraordinary and extravagant a character as to stir the mingled derision and disgust of all decent citizens . Deny Vote Makes Difference . " We are not unmindful , Sir , in submitting these charges against Sheriff , that the offenses charged were committeed at a period antedating his election to his present office on Nov. 3 , 1931 , and that , therefore , since his offenses confessed at the public hearings of the Hofstadter Committee , he has been endorsed by the franchise of his fellow citizens . This , Sir , involves an alleged technicality of the law which is the delight of lawyers , but which we refuse to believe is either sound in law or can be countenanced by the chief magistrate of this State , charged with the duty of keeping clean the channels of public administration . " The recent election of Sheriff to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no guilt before the law , neither does it purge him of moral guilt before the judgment of your Excellency as guardian of the welfare of this State , nor of the citizens of this community who are jealous of its good name . " Sheriff both legally and morally is the same man in his new office that he was in his old . If , in the confusion , excitement and deliberately partisan propaganda of a campaign this fact was ignored by the voters , it can not be ignored by your Excellency in the calm atmosphere of your executive chamber nor in the secret places of your heart . If we believed that you would- take shelter in mere technicalities to evade a moral issue , we would not have wasted the time in filing these charges nor risked the rebuke of their rejection at your hands . " The letter concluded as follows : " You , Sir , have not only the responsibility but the opportunity to sustain Judge Seabury and to lead such a movement for reform as this nation has not seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us and not to fail yourself at this time , when the American people have no will to pardon weakness or forgive desertion . " Like the petition , the letter was signed by Mr. Holmes and Dr. Wise . While Mr. Seabury was working steddily yesterday to complete his report on the magistrates court investigation he conducted as Appellate Division Referee , Irving Ben Cooper , associate counsel , prepared to continue with the affairs of William J. Flynn , Bronx Commissioner of Public Works , at an open hearing on Monday . Mr. Flynn will be a witness , as wil ' Abraham Wilson , his attorney . Mr. Wilson had been sought for some time by process servers of the committee who desired to give him a subpoena , but he had not been found . In Buffalo , yesterday , he declared that he would return in time for the hearing on Monday . Mr. Cooper said that he expected Mr. Wilson to appear .
