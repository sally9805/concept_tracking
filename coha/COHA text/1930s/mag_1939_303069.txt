Fortnight ago every one of the members of the New York County Medical Society* received a ballot stating : " If under Proposition Four of Senator Wagner 's . . . National Health Program , money is made available to New York State to provide care for the low-income earning groups , do you favor the delivery of this medical care by means of compulsory health insurance ? " <P> Last week when the votes were tallied , society officers found that nearly two-thirds of the 4,800 members ignored the ballot , failed to vote . Final figures : 1,286 against compulsory health insurance , 432 in favor . <P> The anti-insurance group , in spite of the fact that they outvoted the progressives , three-to-one , could not lay clear claim to majority support . Members of the pro-insurance group felt that a number of doctors , who might have sent in mailed ballots voting for their side , did not vote at all because of a stipulation that the ballots must be delivered to the society 's headquarters in person . <P> Chief medical spokesmen against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical care are Drs . Samuel Joseph Kopetzky and Haven Emerson . Dr. Kopetzky , a youthful-looking , **29;11954;TOOLONG and veteran of the Spanish-American War , is editor of the official New York Medical Week . He is also an accomplished speechmaker . For months he has been denouncing the National Health Program as " a foreign importation . " If doctors were salaried , he argued , they would not render good medical care , for the desire for money is the greatest incentive in medical practice . From the oath of Hippocrates : " In every house where I come I will enter only for the good of my patients . . . . " <P> Long , narrow Dr. Emerson , a grandnephew of Philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson , is bland and diplomatic . His chief arguments against compulsory health insurance are : 1 ) the U. S. needs no planned medical care , for its citizens are in excellent health despite Government statistics to the contrary : 2 ) political appointees would run insurance systems . Doctors , says Dr. Emerson , must stay out of politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with both feet last week as the final balloting on the society 's insurance question took place . Anti-New Deal Publisher Frank Ernest Gannett gave a dinner at Manhattan 's Plaza Hotel to recruit members for his National Committee to Uphold Constitutional Government , and asked Dr. Emerson to speak . About 75 prominent Manhattan physicians were invited to come and bring as guests four of their wealthiest or most influential patients . The committee solicited money from doctors and friends , promised in return to work for the defeat of the " dangerous , menacing " Wagner bill . <P> Publisher Gannett was absent . Toastmaster was his good friend-bald , shrewd Surgeon Charles Gordon Heyd , former president of the American Medical Association . Dr. Heyd sounded the theme of the meeting : doctors and businessmen must form a political alliance against the New Deal . Chief speakers were Dr. Emerson , who delivered his stock arguments , the committee 's treasurer , Sumner W. Gerard , who claimed that the New Deal was out to rook doctors for the sake of a " piece of cheese , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered a full-throated 1940 campaign speech .
