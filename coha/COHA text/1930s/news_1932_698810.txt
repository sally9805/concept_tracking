txt " As far as I can see there will be no interest default at least until July 1 , " E. G. Buckland , president of the Railroad Credit Corp. , said following a meeting of its board of directors yesterday . Mr. Buckland 's statement followed a day of further declines in the prices of rail bonds which brought the Dow-Jones averages of legal railroad and second grade railroad issues to the lowest levels recorded since the compilations were started In 3914 . Legal railroad bonds dropped 1.50 points on the average yesterday to 78,12 , while the second grade rail average was off .30 at 54.57 . " The total loans authorized by the corporation up to the present time in round figures have amounted to $18,000,000 . Of this amount $6,000,000 has been loaned directly by the Railroad Credit Corp . Another $6,000,000 has been taken over by the Reconstruction Finance Corp. , and the remainder has been advanced by the Reconstruction Finance Corp . on the guarantee of the Railroad Credit Corp .

" The continuing decline in traffic has just about reversed our original estimate of the situation that the corporation would face . It was estimated that the revenues accruing to the corporation this year would amount to approximately $100,000,000 and the loan requirements would be about $60,000,000 . Now it appears that the revenue of the corporation will not amount to more than $55,000,000 , from which we are setting aside possible taxes , and loan requirements likely will total $100,000,000 . Of course , as the traffic decline becomes accelerated demands on us increase and our revenues fall off .
