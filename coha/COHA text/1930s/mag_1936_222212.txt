From the book shelves which line the walls of his chamber in the new Supreme Court Building , Associate Justice Willis Van Devanter last week flipped out a volume , leafed it carefully . With his facts straight , he faced a newshawk , declared : <P> " I was made executor of the estate and some time later several checks were sent me . . . . I had no choice . I signed the checks and turned them into the estate . At any rate , the sum was small . I think those two checks which were returned represented a fourth of the sum . . . . While it is true that , ultimately , I might benefit when the estate is settled , I had no choice as executor . After the act was invalidated , however , I felt that , since I held against the law , the checks should be returned . " <P> The estate of which Justice Van Devanter was executor was that of his late wife . The checks he received were AAA benefits for not growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mrs. Van Devanter . The act which Justice Van Devanter helped to annihilate last January was the AAA . The two checks he thereupon returned to the Treasury were for $45.35 and $14.97 . <P> This disclosure of judicial integrity was the result of a clever bit of sleuthing by Senator Arthur Vandenberg . Last month that Michigan Republican began to display an inordinate curiosity about AAA 's big beneficiaries . Who , he asked , was the cotton grower who received $168,000 , the hog-raiser who received $219,825 , the Puerto Rican sugar producer who received $961,064 ? In the Senate he offered a resolution requiring the Department of Agriculture to furnish a complete list of those ' ' farmers " who had received $10,000 or more in AAA benefits . <P> Senator Vandenberg 's Republican brand of curiosity greatly dismayed Secretary of Agriculture Wallace . To prepare such a list , he explained , would take much time , much money . Besides , the list might induce gangsters to invade the farm . He earnestly wondered if the farmer 's daughter would then be safe . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snorted he : " If the farmer who made that $298.000 for not planting so many thousands of acres of cotton has a daughter , she must be a girl without a soul . That farmer was a corporation . " Republican Chairman Henry Prather Fletcher chimed in : " It is unbecoming to the Secretary of Agriculture to behave and talk as though he were playing a low comedy role in vaudeville . " Promptly Secretary Wallace explained in his Iowa drawl that he had said the " farmer 's dollar , " not the " farmer 's daughter . " <P> As the Senate began to press forward with the Vandenberg resolution to get the facts &; figures on AAA 's ghost . Secretary Wallace released a scattering of information on large benefit payments . Items : <P> Cotton : 46 payments over $10,000 in 1933 ; biggest , $84.000 , to an Arkansas corporation . In 1934 at least two corporations received over $100,000 . <P> Wheat : Seven payments in the year 1934-35 over $10,000 ; biggest , $78,634 , to a California company . <P> Hogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $157,000 , to a California corporation . <P> Tobacco : Five payments over $15,000 in 1934 ; biggest . $41,454 , to a Florida firm . <P> Rice : 19 payments over $25,000 in 1935 ; biggest , $59,286 , to a Louisiana company .
