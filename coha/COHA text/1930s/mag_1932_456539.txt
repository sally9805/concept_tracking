THE question has been asked before . Years and years ago , when Mary Pickford was just Gladys Smith and the prince of pantomime was ' doing ' the London halls with Fred Karno , D. W. Griffith was thinking it over , hopefully . And certainly there have been movies , now and then , that deserved an affirmative answer . But technique has never yet stood still long enough to get the question finally disposed of . Now we have sound , ? such lots of it ! ? with color on the way . Mass entertainment becomes more massive , its finances more gigantic , its publicity machine more formidable , day by day . Radio , linked up with the movies and what is left of vaudeville , has now captured almost the entire concert management business ; and here is the R C A ? Rockefeller combination building what it calls ' a city of art : a city of artists and educators , whose lives are devoted solely to producing aesthetic enjoyment , entertainment , and education to all the people on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the impossible dream of art enthusiasts through the centuries suddenly come to life . ' Almost ? but not quite . The question still is open . Is it art ? Who cares ? I do . And who am I ? I am one of many thousands of people ? thousands , mark you , Mr. Movie Producer ( though I suppose mere thousands are nothing to you ) ? who have learned somehow to know good from bad , true from false , in more things than clothes , food , and tobacco . You will find us everywhere ? from college classrooms and faculty clubs to the fur trades , the hat trades , the needle trades , of New York , Rochester , Chicago , Cincinnati , and points west . I admit you have the aces ? as a class , we are not rich ; but other trades than yours find us worth cultivating . We buy a good many books , and keep a steady pressure on the libraries for those we ca n't afford . We fill the cheaper seats wherever good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if ever you have municipal opera in New York , we are the people who will most steadily ( and critically ) support it . Go to the Stadium concerts or the Metropolitan gallery if you do n't believe me . As a class , we are not highbrow . We are not socially important enough to make discrimination a disguise for snobbery . We read detective tales by the bushel ( and how we have jacked up their quality , by the way ! ) along with Thomas Mann and Artsibashev ; we like our Amos ' n ' Andy , know real jazz from imitation , and visit the Burlesque on a bellyful of beer and sauerkraut when we can get it . I think you would feel at home with us , Mr. Movie Producer ? or you would have done so ten years ago , before you took yourself and your bank account so seriously . For what we want is not so much the msthetic ? that term has an anaemic sound to modern ears ? as the real , the significant , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as dead as last Sunday 's mutton . Perhaps that is as good a working definition of art , for this day and age , as one could get ? the real , the significant , the vital . But it puts you , Mr. Producer , in a rather difficult position . For here you are with a technique ? a very skillful technique ? that is essentially , in your view , a reproduction ; and how can any mere reproduction , no matter how good , be made to fit within that definition ? The painter does not ' reproduce ' a landscape , nor the poet a slice of experience . But movie technique in America seems determined to become an imitation of an imitation , a reproduction of a reproduction . As such , I am willing to grant , it may have a quite legitimate function . It can supplement the newspaper with the news reel , ? the one makes about as much appeal to thought as the other , ? and it can disseminate over a very wide field some knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not enough . Even from the box-office point of view , it is not enough . There is a considerable section of the public that demands more ? demands , in fact , that the cinema move toward the status of an independent art in America as it is doing elsewhere . In order to achieve that status , begin that movement , cinema must fulfill the prerequisite that applies to all art in any medium whatever : namely , the discovery of something to say , and a way of saying it , uniquely fitted to the particular means of expression . The rule holds good without exception for any technique whatsoever ? from soap in sculpture to Wilfrid Thomas and his 587 color-organ or Stravinsky and the ballet . In the light of that criterion , the basic trouble with American cinema is that it has nothing to say . And having evolved no vision of its own , suited to its own unique potentialities , it goes shopping around for things to say that have already been said in other techniques . Sometimes ? as in Holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeds in saying them over again extremely well . But hardly ever does it put its resources to work on genuine movie material . It was learning to do so , with encouraging results , up to about four years ago . But then came sound , and set it back almost where it had started . The development of the silent picture in eliminating the tedious and ridiculous captions and telling a true story of movement in direct and often beautiful picturization was full of promise . Chaplin and Fairbanks had brought their technique to a point at which it really became an art form . The Thief of Bagdad may well have recalled to theatregoers the thrill that swept over London twenty years ago when Reinhardt brought Sumurun to the Coliseum , with the inimitable Constantin . And then King Vidor , in The Crowd , fulfilled ? though in a very different fashion ? Griffith 's early dream of the mass drama ; fulfilled it , despite the frequent false notes , in a fashion that can stand beside the best of Ufa or Sovkino and will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sound set the whole industry back upon the wrong road ? the road of imitation . Drama never got anywhere along that road , and neither ? as an art ? will the movie . The more it succeeds , the more it will fail . When one sees a play one is never , one is not supposed to be , unaware that it is a play . It enacts itself under certain well-understood conditions , conventions , and limitations , out of which ? out of these very conventions and limitations ? the dramatist builds his art form . But the movie has no such accepted conventions and limitations save the one of black and white which it is trying hard to abolish . A movie kiss may not be immoral , but is nearly always offensive . It is more offensive than a stage kiss , since we are never in danger of forgetting that the stage kiss is stage , whereas the movie is always trying to make us forget that it is movie . It tries all the time to persuade us that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality . Sound , as Hollywood uses sound , has encouraged it in this meretricious endeavor ; with the result that a technical innovation of great importance has actually proved an impediment to the development of a genuine art . II Here we have a special case of a general and very interesting problem ? the relation of technique to art in an age of applied science . In the thirteenth century there was no such problem ? for the simple reason that technique was almost entirely manual . The same disciplines which led to mastery of technique led also in the direction of what technique was for . We do not find competent technique along with base design or ignoble aim ; because training in workmanship was also , in the nature of the case , training in art . The master craftsman was not ' at a loose end ' in the use of his craft ; for , though it would be too much to say that even then technique and purpose were the same thing , they grew together out of the same stem and flowered together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization reflected the integration of process , product , and purpose . It was true then , as it has always been , that great achievements need the support of accumulated wealth ; workmen must be fed , housed , and cared for while their product is far in the future ? whether or not that product is ultimately to be the means of taking back from the community more than was advanced to the workpeople . But the accumulated wealth which sustained the workpeople in the great ages of art was not seeking returns of a financial nature ; and from that fact the workpeople derived an advantage largely denied to workpeople of to-day . The patronage which sustained them stood for an idea with which they could do something , instead of an idea with which they can do nothing ? a purpose which enlisted their allegiance to a degree far beyond that which terminates with the pay envelope . It is no doubt well-intentioned of Mr. Smith to exhibit the portraits of the steel workers at the entrances of the Empire State Building ; but neither publicity nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentive with that mediaeval idealism which tapped the vein of power at so much deeper a level . The struggle of a modern corporation to earn its dividends does not provide the artists in its service with ' something to say ' in the sense in which the nature of their enterprise furnished an aesthetic programme to the mediaeval craftsmen . Similarly , among the workpeople themselves , the social pattern ? based , when you come to think of it , on the fact that technique was manual ? afforded safeguards for art itself that later disappeared . It is true that guild organization was eventually subverted by wealth and nepotism to a point at which it had to die a violent death . But in its proper time that organization reflected the characteristic fact of mediaeval production ? the fact that the same disciplines which led to mastery of technique led also in the direction of what technique was for . ' I can not help believing , ' says Mr. G. G. Coulton , in his Art and the Reformation , that the generality of men were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they did not show the frequent modern preference for thoroughly bad art , it was because there was no thoroughly bad art for them to choose . The apprenticeship and guild system , which hindered the highest flights of all , rendered impossible the vilest lapses . ' If we look at the matter from a contemporary standpoint , that , after all , appears more than a little ! Our modern problem arises with the application of large-scale methods of production of all sorts , and especially with the coming in of the new spirit by which those methods were encouraged and directed ? the spirit which Catholics ascribe to the Reformation , and Protestants to the Renaissance . Whether that spirit widened the economic gulf between rich and poor is debatable . There was certainly no innovation about the fact that it was still concentrated wealth that provided the chief opportunities for art . But there was novelty in the means by which wealth might be concentrated . There was , above all , novelty in the preposterous doctrine that the employment of wealth simply to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as might be the theology of the Incarnation , art had found centuries of inspiration in the idea of the Nativity . It could do nothing with Benjamin Franklin 's idea of money begetting money . ' The new idea has become just as universal as the old ; it happens to be an idea that is no good to the artist . Why is it no good to the artist ? Because , philosophically considered , it has no meaning . But in compensation for this loss of catholicity in its message , it is sometimes said , art has been ' socialized ' through the reproductive power of machinery . The fallacy is tempting , but patent . The fact that machine technique turns out tons or thousands where manual technique could produce only pounds or dozens does not mean that art is being socialized . For art lives in men 's minds , or nowhere ; and you can not make good the impairment of men 's minds by surrounding them with larger quantities of things . Any bit of Gothic carving , poor and unique though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victrola record . The very imperfections of Colonial furniture speak a language that is lost in the modern factory . We need not deny that there are also gains involved in the transition . But whether they are compensatory gains is still an open question . III It is , however , in the development of technique itself that the significance of the change comes out most dearly . Under machine technique it is no longer generally true that the disciplines which lead to mastery of the technique lead also in the direction of what technique is for . Training in workmanship is no longer , generally speaking , training in art . There are cases in which the continuity of technique and purpose still obtains , and it is these cases that constitute the real art of our time ? though we do not usually think of them in that way . The modern locomotive , the automobile , the aeroplane , the dynamo ; the feats of civil engineering , especially the great dams ; the instruments of the astronomer and the physicist ? here are cases where mastery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and intention run together , and the product sings with the old integrity of workmanship fully informed of purpose from the start . Above all , the battleship ? the one image of our time that can rouse the populace as could a Gothic portal in the age of faith . Whether these things are great art raises questions of ultimate intention that we must leave aside ; but at least they fulfill the conditions under which art must always be produced . If architects were steelworkers , in the same sense in which the builders of locomotives and battleships are engineers , architecture too might be more than a question mark . But over a wide field that was once the domain of art the divorce of technique from purpose has raised a series of problems . Nor , indeed , over that field alone : the same disintegration is manifest in other social controls than that of art ? the business of credit , for example . Here too , much to our cost , we find that knowledge of technique can be acquired without wisdom in its application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose is not even safe . So , most conspicuously , in the pseudo-arts that science itself has created ? radio and the movies . Here again we have impressive technical development which does not of itself convey any hint of proper function or worthy purpose . The mediaeval mason could not carve his stone without some conception of what was fitting in design and what the stone was for . The copyist , even if he was no monk , but merely a paid scribe ( and sometimes very poorly paid ) , had , in the nature of his work , purpose and function . For the glassworker , design was technique , technique design , and function the governor of both . So with woodworker and smith , armorer and lapidary , poet and musician . But in the arts ' born of science , technique gives no adequate lead to purpose . Radio gives us a machine that will faithfully convey ? anything you like ; to the technician , as such , political blah and Beethoven symphony are all the same . Recently a friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London taxi at midnight , testing a new supersensitive film . He shot five hundred feet of it on ordinary street scenes , and every bit was overexposed ! Magnificent achievement of technique ! ? but what to do with it when you have it/ Technique as such has no more to say ; technicians as such have no more to say . And in the absence of the direct lead from technique to ultimate function , function becomes the uncontested quarry of the money motive , dictated by the patrons of technique ? the money-makers . Within these pseudo-arts the artist has no natural status ; if he would enter at all , it must be as an outsider who has to fight or compromise in an almost single-handed battle . The advantages that science has bestowed on his technique are more than offset by the severity of the struggle he has to make for his own spiritual integrity . And it is ironic that this struggle is most severe in just those fields that should give him his fullest opportunity ? radio and the cinema . IV The proximate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly because this is the one proximate aim thoroughly consistent with the ultimate idea of money begetting money , ' partly because the controllers are genuinely unable to envisage , or to compass , anything else . And the first thing to be said about it is that entertainment is not enough . It is not an adequate policy by which to deal with the common people . It is not even safe . After all , it has been tried before on a still grander scale . It killed the Latin drama much as it is killing the English , together with what there was of music and poetry , and it helped to kill Roman civilization itself . ' All the resources and appliances of material civilization were mobilized to produce spectacles on a scale which the world has never seen before or since , and the net result was , from the point of view of culture , less than nothing . ' Ah , but , ' say the money-makers , our entertainment is moral ! ' The movie industry points to the pontifical jurisdiction of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its lists of previewing organizations ' endorsing ' pictures whose one claim to approval is that they do not conflict with the prejudices of really ' nice ' people . What more could anyone want ? Again , the first thing to be said is that morality ? this sort of morality ? is not enough . Morality of this negative generalized kind needs frequent and vigorous challenging if it is not to degenerate into the lukewarm messiness of people who never indulge in a good drink , a cold bath , or an honest quarrel . All it amounts to is a rude procedure for assuring that the mass of people shall never be startled into thinking seriously , for holding the popular mores as stationary as possible in a world which is in every other respect changing rapidly . Bad taste , false sentiment , and downright vulgarity abound in endorsed pictures ? to say nothing of the unendorsed pictures which go merrily on . The one stipulation is apparently that the cinema shall confirm the comfortable conviction that mass ideology is the best of all possible faiths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villains per se or misguided innocents with whom a Hollywood providence will deal sternly in the last reel . The European movie , technically inferior as it often is to the American , is far more stimulating , because it is free both to deal seriously with important social issues and to make fun of things in general ? including such sacrosanct affairs as marriage and divorce . The American movie , its system clogged and constipated with a sticky diet of stale ideas , has rendered itself almost incapable of either good drama or good farce . The case of Mr. Dreiser and Mr. von Sternberg is illuminating . It might well have been doubted whether the essential values of An American Tragedy could possibly be translated into a moving picture ; but $138,000 is a lot of money , and Mr. Dreiser assented to having the effort made . Here is what he thinks ? with good reason ? of the result : The novel is ' an indictment of our social system , ' and the film is a gross misrepresentation . ' Instead of the picture presenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a murder ; instead of an indictment of society , the picture is a justification of society and an indictment of Clyde . ' And here , most illuminating of all , is a letter which the industry publishes officially as proof of its slogan that ' the objectionable becomes unobjectionable ' : ' When I heard this picture was to be made I rather regretted it , as I felt the book was not of sufficient value to be brought before the public . The picture has made me change my mind . ' Current movie ideology is illustrated even more vividly by two press extracts reproduced side by side in the Motion Picture Monthly ? the official organ of the Hays office . One states the opinion of the Presbyterian , a church publication from Philadelphia : ' We saw Skippy , which is making its appeal to children . To us it was not funny and was utterly wrong in its general philosophy , and also presented a sickly sentimentalism on the part of silly parents . ' The other is an editorial comment from the Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed with h ; s little heart seemingly broken , and when a little girl in front of me cried over the death of a dog in the picture , I was not ashamed that I had to wipe something from my eyes also . I like to see such pictures presented in Houston . ' Will it be believed that the industry thinks it has proved the value of the film by printing these two extracts side by side ? One would like to hear the candid comments of any half-dozen Hollywood producers on Skippy and the sentimental editor . After all , it is not as if Hollywood or Mr. Hays were consumed with a burning fire of conviction as to the finality of common taste or morality . The situation would be more hopeful if they were ? somebody might undertake to cure them , and there would be an issue in the air . Mr. Hays was put in to drag the industry out of a mess , and stays in ( very expensively ) to keep it on the right side of the politicians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie , considered as a whole , has nothing to say ; and the public , this past two years , has been showing on that account a perceptible loss of interest in it . It is matter , therefore , for serious consideration whether it would not be worth while , both for the industry and for the public , to scrap the entire line of tactics and propaganda pursued by the Hays organization and encourage producers to go ahead and produce what ever they like . Undoubtedly there would be some risk involved ? some pornography , in short . But there would remain , not merely the police , but an increasing number of people in the industry itself concerned to take it seriously and stop abuse . And there might be a good deal gained , for a reason suggested earlier in this article , which the reader may now care to consider . V The movie industry , even in America , is at last beginning to develop an independent technique . It has been slow to do this because its principal interest hitherto has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technique of ' money begetting money . ' The power , however , of a purely technical interest in the cinema as such is asserting itself in numerous small groups or individuals scattered about the country , and to some extent even in Hollywood ; and it is from technique , if from anywhere , that salvation may come . By this I mean that if the American cinema , or any considerable part of it , can move forward from the point at which it is merely the commercial exploitation of an ingenious machine to the point at which it regards that machine as a necessary incidental in the practice of a genuine technique of the cinema as such , ? a new means of expression , ? then that technique itself may push its practitioners forward into a position in which they will be compelled to find something significant to say . A genuine cinema technique will ( or rather may ) of itself demand theme and subject matter that are significant in the social and philosophical , as well as in the artistic , sense . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presupposes certain essentials : freedom for the producer , and an outlet to the public ( which may have to be specially devised ) ; freedom from the mob ideology inculcated by the Hays office and the financial interests ; selection of theme and subject purely from the cinema point of view ? not from a desire to exploit , for financial reasons , any new craze , story , news topic , or reputation . But there is this much as prima fade encouragement for such a forecast : the films which have won lasting recognition as worth while , in the larger sense , are in most cases those in which a genuine cinema technique has been most nearly approached . To take an early example , D. W. Griffith was one of the first men in America to strive for the development of a cinema technique that should be more than mere photography , or cinephotography . He developed not only spectacle ( artificial , in his case ) , but the visual leitmotif , some intelligent use of the close-up , and an elementary montage ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequence . Mr. Griffith would be the first to testify that his desire to do these things ? to achieve what he called the mass drama ? compelled him to search for material that would sustain them ; and the result was that the famous Griffith films had something to say ? something not very profound or original , perhaps , something that reflected in certain ways his personal prejudices , but something significant as far as it went . Again , the moments of greatness that King Vidor has achieved are precisely those in which his technique has been nearest to pure cinema ; his moments ( or half hours ) of failure are precisely those in which he falls back on mere story , star , or mob sentiment to carry his film along . Mr. Flaherty 's film , just because it is so often real movie , conveys something profoundly suggestive to thought and imagination . Chaplin 's work , precisely because it is so nearly pure cinema , constitutes a commentary on life that defies expression in any other medium . In Europe the documentary film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject matter is used simply on the basis of its suitability to cinema expression . The result is in many cases a challenging , yet almost unconscious , comment on civilization . Let me state here that I purposely avoid discussion of the revolutionary cinema of Russia . That cinema has from its very nature something significant to say ; and its tremendous incentive gives it a corresponding aesthetic advantage . Its outlook is far more hopeful , and its essential problem far simpler , than that of the American cinema . Similarly I make my acknowledgments to the revolutionary groups in this country and in England , especially to the editors of Experimental Cinema ? groups which have come to demand a radical change in social control and philosophy . They may be right in their contention that there is no redeeming the popular cinema without such change . I will go so far as to say that it looks that way at present . But I am trying here to outline a position which makes the fewest possible demands , which starts as near as possible to existing American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best hope I can discern lies in an increasing preoccupation with cinema technique ? in the development , that is to say , of an attitude in which all that science can give is taken for granted , and its appliances fall increasingly into the control of men concerned with cinema expression as such . Then , I suggest , it may once more be true that mastery of technique will lead also in the direction of what technique is for . VI The reader , if ( like the writer ) he is a pure outsider in this business , needs at this point to understand somewhat more definitely what is meant by the technique of the cinema ; especially in those respects in which it is different from the technique of the camera . The vast mass of American movies are still mere photography ? good , when they are good , only in a mechanical sense . The usual American film is built of what is supposed to be popular subject matter , ? story , play , novel , revue , any old thing , ? plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera prettiness tied together in a desperate effort to amuse the thirteenyear-old mind . ( As a matter of fact , much of it is an insult to even the thirteen-year-olds . I have two , and I know it . ) The thesis here advanced applies to it , therefore , only so far as an increasing interest in the cinema itself can win its way against all the other pressures and motives . Cinema consists of three elements ? image , movement , sequence ; and a little thought about each of them in turn can put the layman in a position to understand at least the elements of the discussion . Image : a photograph in a rectangular frame ; a photograph of something seen . There are so many different things to see , and so many people to see them ! And we all see such different things in the same objects , the same people ? do we not ? If anyone could show me your world exactly as you see it , ? even if it consists of pretty much the same things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might learn quite a lot about you . And then suppose you are a farmer and I a city clerk ; or suppose you are on the crest of the wave , and I in the trough of some misfortune or obsession ? what different things we shall see in each other 's worlds ! Here is one possibility of camera work in the hands of a director ( like Alexander Room ) who can get inside people 's minds , and give you his characters by giving you their world as it is to them . Next take the case everybody has encountered ? the case of the artist , sweating and suffering to show you the things he sees in your world for no other reason than because he must . Still photography is being used to do this , not only in Germany but in America , in the work of Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Weston and other pioneers . The significance of things ? that is what such men are after , not mere prettiness . To see their work is an event ; something happens to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a challenge to the visual understanding . If you can not see their work , look at a Cezanne or a Van Gogh still life ? especially at Van Gogh 's ' Kitchen Chair . ' Here , indeed , is more than the camera can ever do ; but the effort to grasp the peculiar kind of significance that such work attains will convey an idea of what image may be . The essence of it can not be translated , though a whole metaphysic may be built around it . Now consider the appearances of things as they may come to a philosophic or reflective mind ; the sort of mind that , seeing them for what they are , sees them at the same time in a certain mood , a certain temper , a certain key ? the key of compassion , let us say , or irony , or fatalism , or , if that is possible , sub specie ceternitatis . This is the order of vision that we meet in Eisenstein , in Chaplin , sometimes in King Vidor ? this personal impersonality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of apprehending things , a certain sense of life . And remember that at one moment your vision may be almost completely filled with some quite small thing , ? an ink bottle , a fly , a hand ( this is the justification for the close-up ) , ? while at the next it may take in the contours of an entire landscape , an entire city ; also that the camera can see more than the eye can see ? farther down , and higher up , as it were . Observe , too , that in all this we are taking for granted all the technical accomplishments of the camera as such , ? depth , chiaroscuro , stereoscopic effect , composition in the frame , camera angle , distortion , and so on , ? and feeling our way forward toward a use of them which shall give us an idea of what these things are for . Movement , and the rhythm of movement : the event . Let me say briefly ( though it is , I think , the most esthetically important of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? all ? is in the same way true of the event . The cinema is much closer to the event than the stage ? let anyone who doubts it read George Arliss 's amusing account of his first cinema experience in Up the Years from Bloomsbury . I would ask the reader to apply , bit by bit , what has been said above of the image to the concept of the event ; for this is one of the fundamental and unique properties of true cinema . The work of Pudovkin shows it in an intense degree ; Ponuner and Rene Clair use it effectively , though in quite other keys . Then the rhythm of movement ? of gesture , of crowds , of machinery ; of traffic , of the sky , of the waves ? here is something that cinema can handle and control to its own purposes , sometimes in the object itself , always in the instrument . And here again we have a technique that begins where photography leaves off , and leads ? or may lead ? of itself in the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of images and events , not all in the same tempo , the same key , or the same degree of realization . That is visual life , that is cinema . Here is an illuminating quotation : ' The possibility that the great master did not realize the erroneous relationship of the sizes is quite out of the question . He rejected naturalism quite consciously , and while every detail separately regarded is constructed on the principle of the most concentrated naturalism , their combination in the general composition is subordinated solely to the problem of content . He took as his normal proportions the quintessence of psychological expressiveness . ' The passage refers , not to a cinema artist , but to the eighteenth-century Japanese engraver , Sharaku ; and it is quoted from Kurth 's monograph by Eisenstein in a recent issue of Experimental Cinema . Eisenstein adds : ' Is not this exactly what we of the cinema do in time , as he in simultaneity , when we cause a monstrous disproportion of the elements of a normally flowing event , dismembering it . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the disintegrated event once more into one whole , but in our aspect . According to our treatment in relation to the event . ' That brings the reader into contact with what I am tempted to call the metaphysics of montage ? montage being the deliberate ordering of sequence in film image and event , looking toward the final totality of effect . I take another , perhaps easier , analogy from the writings of the pianist , George Woodhouse . Woodhouse , taking the Tannhauser ' Pilgrims ' Chorus ' as a familiar example , asks , In what does the music really consist ? It is not simply in the melody . It is not in the rather uninteresting chords , taken as chords . The music is what happens in between the chords , happens in the listener 's mind ; the music is in the sequence . From the tension established in the mind , subsisting and developing through the succession of auditory impulses , arises a whole that is more than the sum of the parts ? that is , in short , Wagner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cinema are developing their own visual-temporal art ? an art that is only just struggling into the Hollywood consciousness . And again , it turns out to be a technique that may , of its own momentum , push the film forward into the realm of meaning . VII That the development in America of cinema technique may lead in the direction of really significant art is but a guess ; but in view of the circumstances it seems the best guess possible . The present financial motivation of the industry imposes on it a double handicap : the advance toward a genuine cinema technique is retarded , and the results of that technique sincerely and courageously used are discountenanced . Sincerity and courage are not among the virtues known to the Hays office . Yet neither of these handicaps is inherent even in private financial control . Movies everywhere are commercial except in Russia ; but even from the commercial point of view it pays better to aim high than to aim low . The American cinema for many years has based its policy upon the appeal to the mob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial penalty ? of having done so . It is likely to go on paying that penalty for a long time without even the consolation of being able to lay the blame upon the trade depression . For the simple fact is that people are easily surfeited with that sort of entertainment . So long as new shocks , new stunts , can be produced every week , idle curiosity may sustain interest ; but the shocks and the stunts become more and more expensive as they become less and less effective , and eventually the public is seized with apathy while the industry is in the grip of financial elephantiasis . That is the present position . The public has reached the point at which all movies and all movie stars begin to look alike ; and it will not take the trouble to distinguish the good films from the bad ones . As a matter of fact , the industry has produced some of the best narrative films ever made anywhere within the past year or so . But it has gone on so long advertising bad work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer registers . ' We have heard it all so often before . If the movie industry were to consult the librarians as to what people read in America , it might get some inkling of its own mistake . Apart from the phenomenal success in this country of such authors as Dewey , Wells , Russell , Jeans , Eddington , the tremendous improvement within the past decade in the quality of popular novels , detective stories , and the writing in the big weeklies is worth pondering by the commercial producers . America is not-so completely tabloid-minded as Hollywood thinks it is . Thousands upon thousands of quite ordinary people have so often paid their money to sit in darkness for a couple of hours and have their senses and their intelligence simultaneously affronted that not even the industry 's most frantic advertising will now lure them within reach of a box office . The industry has aimed for years too low , and the public has awakened to the fact before Hollywood . It does not pay to libel half a nation . In the long run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is a better investment than claptrap . We are not yet ready to admit ? at least , the writer is not ? that the only hope for art lies in social revolution . If the Russian cinema is on the whole the finest , that is not because of , but in spite of , the fact that it is propaganda . Its strength lies in its freedom from the stupid fetishism of ' money begetting money , ' in its freedom to concern itself with life that is real in place of life that is sham . It might be even stronger were the hand of the state less heavy upon it . For it is less likely that revolution will foster art than that art will foster revolution ; and there is no general validity in either theorem . All that can be said is that art will gravitate toward that system in which it finds the greater freedom . Poor and dangerous is the state of that nation in which the search for riches involves the enslavement of the arts . This is not generally the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , it can not be accused of unfriendliness toward the arts . Here is the possibility of a new art , born out of science , which may with luck and courage ( invincible combination ! ) enable American society to look itself in the face as never before , and perhaps ? who knows ? ? discern some nobler destiny upon its forehead than ' money begetting money . ' Why should not the industry use its own powers of finance and publicity , its control of distribution and exhibition facilities , in order to keep its output worthy of a people that still claims to be both free and progressive ? It has everything ? including perhaps a few dollars ? to gain , and , heaven knows , little enough to lose . Or must this become yet another case where private charity has to be called in to rescue culture from civilization ?
