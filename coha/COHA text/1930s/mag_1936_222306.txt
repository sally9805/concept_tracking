Among certain pious and ingrained orthodox Jews exists a belief that rabbis , closer to God than ordinary people , may obtain spiritual benefits on behalf of the sick or the troubled . Such Jews also believe that benefit may be derived from performing a good deed or mitzvah , such as giving money to charity . In Brooklyn , N. Y. last week one Anna Seigel went to the police with a story of how she had paid $200 as a mitzvah for her paralyzed daughter and was now wondering if she had been swindled . Upon investigation of Mrs. Seigel 's complaint the Brooklyn district attorney declared that the police had turned up " one of the most novel and extensive rackets for mulcting the poor and afflicted people which has ever come to my attention . " <P> Arrested was a buck-toothed spinster of 36 named Mary Berd . Miss Berd has for some years been private secretary to one Zeida Schmellner onetime " Grand Rabbi " of Rumania before he arrived in the U. S. in 1925 amid the greetings of the acting Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the files of Miss Berd and Rabbi Schmellner last week , police and 25 accountants said they uncovered records of nearly $2,000,000 taken in as " loans . " According to police who questioned both the rabbi and his secretary , the " racket " worked as follows : <P> A Jew who believed in the rabbi 's reputation for sanctity would pay for benefits , understanding that the payment was merely an earnest of his good faith , that it was to be used for charity . Rabbi Schmellner and Miss Berd insisted that these payments were loans , secured by promissory notes . The fact that many of the loans were never repaid they explained as resulting from pious generosity . But police said they found that Miss Berd employed nine men at $100 per week in her transactions , which extended as far as Canada . Riding around in a big limousine , she maintained personal contact with some people who claimed last week she gave them promissory notes in envelopes which were to be kept sealed lest the mitzvah turn into a " curse . " Protested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a frame-up . You see I am smiling , so I have nothing to worry about . Whatever I did I did for the best . Everything is 100% perfect . "
