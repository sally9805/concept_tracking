Without blanching , last week Philadelphia 's weekly meeting of Methodist clergymen heard Rev. Dr. Samuel Walter Grafflin , 66 , a colleague from White Plains , N. Y. , declare : ' ' The Church is spending too much effort reaching the nice little boys instead of the hell-raisers . And while I 'm at it , let me say something in favor of that grand old word , hell . I 'd like to know the bo who first called that word profane . The ministry could do nothing better than legitimatize it . Hell is the only word you can use to say , ' It 's as hot as , ' or ' as cold as ' or ' as dry as . ' You just ca n't say anything else and make it sound right . If you say , ' It 's as cold as hell , ' everybody knows what you mean . "
