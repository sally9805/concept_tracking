WE came to Trinidad an hour before dawn , when Venezuela , to the west , was a half-imagined blur , remote and fancied in the dark . An indecisive wind smelled of some forest where vegetation beneath the trees was rotting from endless lack of sun . In the empty darkness our ship reduced its speed ; felt its way through the vague channels of the Bocas ( page 343 ) . Occasionally , when some cove held back the air , we detected a faint humid odor of old water . " That 's a river smell , " said the resident . " The Orinoco empties into the sea at the other side of the Gulf of Paria . " His match flared in the gloom ; a sudden line of white deck-rails loomed out and vanished . " Have you ever seen a tropical river ? The water has a color well , it 's hard to say ; it looks somewhat like deep-brown iron rust . " In the growing half-light I could see the channel more clearly . The hill-faces lifted out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around our ship , the illusion of their height lending a sense of overbalance . Below us a tidal current swept to the Caribbean . Its self-made waves slapped with an odd , contrary sound against the steel . " I see lights behind us , " I remarked , " three of them . " The resident frowned a moment . " I thought they were houses , " he said , at length . " Some of the people in Port-ofSpain have homes here on the Bocas . But those are ships . " SHIPS OF MANY FLAGS He chuckled into the wind . " You 'd be surprised how many ships come to Trinidad , " he rambled on . " They say about five thousand a year . Really , Trinidad is important in its way ? a sort of midwife to the Caribbean . " Rusty old freighters loaded with cargo come here and leave their freight to be stored on wharves . Afterwards another freighter ambles along , picks it up , and carts it away to Africa , or Asia , or North America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the Orinoco , or Maracaibo , where the bay is too shallow for the large boats . " If someone in Rio wanted to send an automobile to Capetown the automobile would probably come to Trinidad and stay here until a boat for South Africa made its regular stop . " The morning light grew stronger . Trinidad lay quietly on the port bow : a silent , tree-covered island , not mountainous , but confusedly hilly . Faint houses along the shore and the single white road , empty in the dawn , gave it the unassuming appearance of a countryside in northern New York . Only the smell the unforgettable rank smell of the jungle and the derisive shrieks of the sea birds proved otherwise . " Port-of-Spain is ahead there , " the resident pointed , " You can just about see it . " In the quiet wind a flat-bottomed boat came out of the dawn , two natives pushing it forward with their long poles . They walked in unison , silent , padding over and over in the same track like donkeys enslaved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " nodded my companion . " You see , the harbor is shallow . The Government is dredging a channel to the wharves , but many ships still have to anchor about two miles from shore . They unload the cargo into those boats . It 's rather inconvenient . You and I have to go ashore by tender . " " I usually enjoy it , though , " he chuckled again . " Ever since Columbus discovered Trinidad , people coming here have been going ashore in small boats . " But there were no gasoline engines in those days , I reflected , as we clattered down the gangplank onto the heaving and faintly gurgling tender . Columbus discovered the island in 1498 , on his third voyage to the New World . In a letter to Ferdinand and Isabella , he explains why it was named " Trinity " : " A sailor went up to the main-top to look out and to the westward saw three mountains near one another . " These peaks , locally known as the Three Sisters , officially are Trinity Hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island 's southern coast , the explorer saw lands " as lovely and as green as the orchards of Valencia in March . " After crossing the Gulf of Paria , he turned westward along the coast of what is now Venezuela . This shore he termed " the most lovely in the world . " Convinced that the " earthly paradise " of the ancient philosophers lay somewhere in these newly discovered regions , the Admiral later petitioned his sovereigns for authority to explore further , but his proposed expedition was never carried out . SOUTH AMERICA- " JUST ANOTHER ISLAND " Across the gulf , dimly , Columbus saw the hills of the South American Continent rolling away in recurrent waves . Dismissing them as another island , he set around for home . In 1595 Sir Walter Raleigh came to Trinidad , on his way to El Dorado , which had been located beyond question in the upper regions of the Orinoco . Being of a military mind , and knowing the danger of a hostile city at his rear , he burned the Spanish capital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships with pitch from the famous Pitch Lake ( page 323 ) . The records of early Spanish government following Raleigh 's visit show a curious attention to clothes . It is noted that the city fathers owned but one pair of knee breeches among them ( suggesting odd social difficulties ) , while some colonists were so poor that they could go to Mass only once a year , and then only in borrowed garments ! This humble and human touch attracted the historians who  | followed : they mentioned but little more of the Spanish colonizers . Another arrival , Sir Ralph Abercromby , sailed to Port-of-Spain in 1797 and demanded that Don Jose Maria Chacon , the Spanish governor , surrender the island . Chacon was a humane man , out of touch with his times . Sensible of the bloodshed which was certain to result from any conflict with Abercromby 's superior force he turned Trinidad over to the English . There and then the island settled into its niche , became steadfast , loyal , and serene . Ranking next to Jamaica in size among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the State of Rhode Island . The Colony of Trinidad and Tobago has a population estimated ( in 1935 ) at more than 439,000 . More than 1,000 miles of good roads and 123 miles of Government railways help trade and travel . ENIGMATIC PORT-OF-SPAIN Perched on the bow of a tender you see the capital from the humble viewpoint of the early visitors . Port-of-Spain today is rather enigmatic . Unlike most cities of the world , it has no established personality , no tangible formula of atmosphere that one can grasp and hold aloft with triumph . It is a tropical metropolis of about 75,000 people , with some of the finest hotels in the West Indies . In all hotels the beds ? huge beds , canopied with impressive but rarely used mosquito netting ? are made twice a day , for  | there is an hour of siesta when everyone is expected to muss them up . Tea is a ceremony , almost Japanese in its circumstance . You dine on plantains that are oversized bananas ; on bread-fruit , tasting rather like a potato ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their fruit ; on mamones , incredible oddities which are sucked for their taste , not their juice , and are scarcely worth eating ( Plate IV ) . All these are stabilized by the reassuring dishes of the northern continent . On the streets behind the Savannah in the hot afternoons one imagines the mood is Spanish , broiling in its own juice at siesta hour . Marine Square , tree-choked , could be continental were it not a little British , and might become more British in the absence of the West Indies ( page 340 ) . It is hard to say that Port-of-Spain is sleepy or active , lovely or dull , or that one looks back on it from a distance with any definite feeling . It is a city of bicycles pedaled by natives , and houses inhabited by various Caribbean peoples , as if the natives had been pushed to this bottleneck of the sea by force of weight above . And bicycles or houses lead to no conclusion . Some of the British residents rise at sunup while the air is cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Queen 's Park Savannah . It is a long walk . But mornings in the Tropics are a compensation for the day : the English in white linen , the East Indians in white cotton , young girls and boys playing ? all clatter under the trees while the air is cool and the world good . It will not be the same at noon .  | You meet with a yellow-breasted bird in the park that interrupts you by seeming to speak French . " Qu'est-ce qu'il dit ? Qu'est-ce qu'il dit ? " he asks interminably . " What did he say ? What did he say ? " But the bird ( the Derby flycatcher ) never waits for an answer , hopping off to ask his empty little question of someone else . A LITERAL OPEN HOUSE I stopped at Government House one afternoon to visit the aide . We had tea on the veranda . " Why is the house so open ? " I asked , waving at the doors and windows . " Do n't you ever have a burglar ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We keep the place open to get the air . The wind here in Trinidad is cool so long as you 're out of the sun . So far as intruders go , the status of Governor seems to be so firmly fixed and unapproachable to these native people that even the idea of entering the grounds gives them considerable awe . West Indians have a good respect . " I had noticed how smartly the native policemen in Port-of-Spain controlled the traffic . Given a post of some authority , they dropped the more instinctive attitude of compliance with old bondages . They had expected no such power as that which was granted them , and in their effort to prove worthy of it , and to retain it , they seek to imitate the qualities of the British officials . It is a heartening sight . " I 'll tell you about the West Indians ' respect for power , " continued the aide . " When the Duke and Duchess of Kent came to visit Trinidad in 1935 , we had a lawn party here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III ) . " We invited about 1,500 people . The grounds could accommodate that number , but very few more . So we had the problem of keeping the remainder of the curious  | populace from breaking in . The gardens are public , you know , and technically any citizen of Trinidad may demand the right to enter . " We finally posted a number of Royal Guards around the boundaries of the house . They were ordered to frown sternly , but also were instructed not to stop any native who wished to enter . The frowns turned the trick . Although each guard was spaced about ten feet from the other , the entire island populace stood back respectfully and watched from outside the line . " The only creatures who have no respect for law are the animals and birds , " he chuckled . " We have trouble keeping bats out of the Governor 's house . We are annoyed by the lightning bugs . Somehow when you see those little insects flying around your mosquito net at night you get a fearful notion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FRONT TO THE WORLD The aide gave me a letter of introduction to the harbor master . There was not a great deal that a harbor master could do : the wharves , the water front , the loudtongued chaos , had no fences around them , and anyone , even without a letter , could explore quite freely . Trinidad , superficially , seems the reverse of an ant heap , for its activity shows best at the surface , the veneer of the water front . You stand by the cranes where cargo is fed into the maws of omnivorous tenders and come to the conclusion that the island is crudely modern . Back in the interior , however , on a forest-silent road you say with equal certainty that commerce at the surface boils by applied heat , not by inner force , and that all the rest of Trinidad is apathetic . Then you find you are wrong in either conclusion . Trinidad faces you every way . The coconut is one of the faces . Out of the palm groves , mile after mile of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn many of them into copra , " said a plantation owner as we followed a path through the Manzanilla grove . " just how is copra handled ? " I asked , listening to a distant rattle of wind through the high leaves . " Copra , as you know , is the dried broken meat of the coconut . We cut each nut into sections and let the sections dry in the sun to prevent putrefaction . Afterwards we ship most of the dried meat away to factories that manufacture coconut oil for margarine , soap , and other products . " " What about cacao ? " I asked . I had seen the vast cacao forests on the hills back of Upper Manzanilla . " Cacao forests ? " He was puzzled momentarily . " Oh , you mean those big trees . Those are n't cacao ; they 're called immortelle , and we plant them at spaced intervals to shade the cacao . Cacao grows usually as a low tree ( page 341 ) . " Before this drying process begins , " he explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put them into vats , where the surrounding pulp is removed by fermentation . " He showed me trays of cacao beans drying in the sun . A strong odor of fermentation rose from them , mingled with a chocolate smell . " Cacao has fallen in value these days , " said the plantation owner . " But in 1935 we exported more than two and a half million dollars ' worth . " EAST INDIANS WORK IN WEST INDIAN FIELDS In some regions of the island I saw East Indians working in the flooded fuzzy-green areas of rice fields , their legs bare , their heads shielded under big hats , their whole aspect suggestive of the Orient . But rice was rare . Mile after mile of sugar cane rolled down from the mountains . pale-green and high . Water buffaloes work in these fields at cutting times . Once I happened on a group of women who were chopping stalks into small sections ( page 336 ) . " They plant these , " said my driver . " After a while another sugar cane grows out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canes out of each old stalk . " The cane workers wield their machetes with consummate skill . They are predominantly East Indians . Trinidad is crowded with East Indians ; about a third of its population belongs to that race . After slavery was abolished in the island . they were brought over from India between 1845 and 1917 , under a system of indenture , to work on the plantations . After their period of service was ended , they were either given free passage back to India or allowed to remain . Many stayed . I had seen their temples clinging to the hills of the island . Since these orientals  | arrived , generations had passed , yet the evidence of their faith existed , pathetic , perhaps , in its struggle to maintain itself without the spur of higher religious officials . Little brown men dressed in their common robes went through the motions . A congregation listened with an Eastern respect and the laziness of the tropical West . Outside of the enclosure a flamboyant tree would rest its branches against the wall ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the services ( Plate II ) . Twenty thousand of the East Indians in Trinidad are Mohammedans . Their temples are barer , less decorated than the Hindu temples , but their fervor is strong : they have no show windows for passing visitors . You remove your shoes to enter , but they give you no slippers , as do the guardians of the mosques in the East . You tread in a sensitive fashion across mats and carpets , and squat down listening to someone chant from the Koran . The book is their proudest possession . The temple has been built around it , as if it were the book that mattered , not the words , while the old priest who reads it feels with a trembling and humble finger down the page . A TOO-CLOSE SHAVE East Indians throng Port-of-Spain . They crowd the streets and markets with a lusty carelessness ; they regard work but little , and seem to subsist , almost miraculously , without it . They stride on their way with easy carriage , rather a lordliness , and incessant amusement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember seeing one East Indian having his hair cut , or rather ( although unwittingly ) having it shaved . Absorbed in conversation with someone standing in the doorway , he was unaware that the barber was half asleep at his work ; it was near siesta time . Not until the patron had risen , clapped on his hat , and found it upheld only by his ears , was he conscious of what had happened . A flood of terrible abuse descended on the barber . It continued unabated until finally , screaming aloud his misfortune , the bald victim emerged onto the street where he called on the passers-by to witness his misery . Heads popped from windows , men stepped to the doors of their stores , even the donkey carts paused . Everyone thought it was funny , very funny . The victim stormed away , shaking his fists at the heavens . But after a while he came to a silent alley , where he turned aside to contemplate himself . His big hand explored the stubble that stuck out on top . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He put both hands to his head and chuckled . In a moment , hands still on his head , he started to roar . THE WORLD 'S " HOTTEST LAKE " Beyond the sugar canes were oil fields where aluminum tanks and high steel towers halted , in a more effective manner than the rice fields , any encroachment by sugar cane . Agriculture ended . Everywhere about the roadways and the homes of the workers a smell of gasoline hung about the air . When the wind stirred the gasoline mingled argumentatively with an odor of hot leaves . " Trinidad became in 1929 the largest oilproducer in the British Empire , " said the manager of the Pitch Lake enterprise . " A very imposing statement . I like to think that Britain , in wartime , would depend on us to supply her warships with fuel . " He showed me around Pitch Lake , while his sons and daughter accompanied us , as if , until a stranger came , they had not visited the place ( page 323 ) . " We took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he remarked . " Sometimes it 's more than that ? and yet the lake shows little sign of its loss . " If we dig a hole five feet deep today , tomorrow the hole is filled up again . Nothing we do to it seems to make much difference . They tell me that the surface has gone down a few inches in the last decade or so , and that sooner or later the lake will be exhausted . Not while I 'm alive , though . " We strode onto the lake . It was firm and slightly rough , formed into bulges , as if bubbles that rose from below had been held underneath by the weight of the mantrodden surface . In the oily pools of water around the crevices a number of fish were living , and a rather lonely frog jumped out to look at us as we passed . " This is one of the hottest places on earth , " the manager continued . " The asphalt absorbs the heat of the sun and emits it again , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | He picked up a chunk in his hands . " The pitch alters its shape gradually , " he said . " In the old days when they made the mistake of shipping it in the holds of ships without any packing , just dumping the carloads , they often found when they got to their destination that the entire mass had fused together again . Then they would have to dig it out . Now we refine it in the factory and barrel it ourselves . " There is a special wharf , so that ships which come to Trinidad for pitch need not wait in Port-of-Spain . " The lake sinks a little under my feet , " I observed . He nodded . " We have to move the railway tracks every few days , " he explained . " Otherwise they sink into the ground and disappear . But contrarily the lake has the habit of disgorging pieces of odd things that fell into it hundreds of years ago . That trunk of a tree over there has been estimated as three thousand years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " LAST OF THE HIGH FORESTS Pitch Lake is on the southern shore of the Gulf of Paria . If you draw a straight line diagonally in the opposite direction you would cross the sugar-cane regions again and come to the High Forests . The High Forests are equatorial jungle . Very little comes out of this jungle that has important commercial value . It covers only a small portion of Trinidad , for enterprise has pushed it back , hacked at it for succeeding years , until the original trees have dwindled miserably to the region around Toco on the northeastern coast , the most primitive district of the island .  | You can find the jungle there if you go soon enough , for eventually the High Forests will meet up with commercial enterprises , and then the jungle will be pushed off into the sea . Darwin and Charles Kingsley , Humboldt and Schomburgk and Bates , whose pens were aided by a knowledge of natural science , have told of the jungle ; in the face of them no one less equipped should speak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in some empty clearing and watched the vines shivering up to a gloom where the sky should be ; unless you have heard the vague , distant sound of leaves muttering , and a crash where some unknown animal scurries through the roots , and smelled the mingled fragrance of flowers and dead things , of wood and old water ; most of all , unless you have felt the indefinable creeping sensation of unseen live things , moving , like insects , with vague waving stealth , you have only the poorest conception of the High Forest . A solitary road leads through them to the north shore and Toco . In Kingsley 's day a man was forced to go on horseback along rain-rutted native paths . ROADS OF OTHER DAYS L. O. Inness in his Reminiscences of Old Trinidad described their condition : The manner of keeping them in repair was to fill up the ruts and holes with quantities of megass * during the dry season , over which the cane carts ran merrily to the mill-yard ; but when the rains began , these megass-filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even carts sometimes disappeared . " He wrote further of " a rider who was carefully picking his way along a country road when he saw a good-looking hat lying in the mud which he thought was worth retrieving , so he leaned over and lifted it with the crook of the hunter when , what was his astonishment to see the head of a man , who abjured him in mournful tones :  | For the Lord 's sake , go and get assistance , there is a mule under me . ' " The region is somber . And the road to Galera Point runs along a coast line torn with pitted gray rocks that catch the long waves out of Africa and smash them willynilly in a white fury . Habitations are sparse . The Toco section remains today as the Caribbean islands must have looked when the colonizers arrived , dangerous and remote , guarded by the sea . IGUANAS AND THATCHED HUTS Iguanas crawl through the rocks . A few sea birds which have strayed from the better hunting grounds of the Gulf skim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thatched huts , a trade-mark of the primitive . And every evening a white lighthouse at the northeastern point blinks solemnly at the sea . Unlike the other islands , you can not grasp Trinidad by its four corners and fold it up into any bundle that a person can measure and define . WEST INDIES ARE MINIATURES OF MANY LANDS AND PEOPLES Barbados is a calm British pilot fish , absorbed in sugar cane . Curacao is scarcely more than a town set on rock , punishing the empty land by its devotion to oil . Jamaica is natural : the towns are overwhelmed by mountains , jungle , sea ; nothing can overcome its vehement beauty . Haiti is African ; Antigua is the American West ; Martinique is a beautiful hodge-podge , like an Eastern bazaar . In Trinidad there is something of all of them . The Crossroads island is one of those lands which has lost a personality of its own to assume the character of the earth .  |                @ @ @ @ @
