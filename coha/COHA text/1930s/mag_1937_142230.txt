In the early days of Christianity , Egypt was famed for her desert fathers , solitary saints who lived in caves or on pillars , made friends of lions , jackals , converts of such sinners as the beauteous courtesan Thais . Over Egypt 's sands last week trudged 300 policemen , mobilized by the Government to deal with 100 merry desert monks wrongfully occupying a monastery because they felt their social life was being repressed . <P> Three years ago seven monks of the monastery of Deir-el-Moharrak , on the edge of the desert near Assiut , rebelled because they received only $1.50 per month for pocket money . Bearded Auba Yoanes XIX , Patriarch of Egypt 's ancient Coptic Church , excommunicated the seven , then pardoned them while their abbot raised their allowance to $7.50 per month . On this the monks grew merrier &; merrier , saving up their money for uproarious nights in nearby Bedouin and Moslem villages . Such a nuisance became the Copts that the villagers told Abbot Sidarous to keep his men at home , else they would be shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposed Abbot Sidarous , elected from their midst a new abbot who would not only condone but join in their nights of fun . At once Patriarch Yoanes threatened to excommunicate all 100 monks , commanded them to vacate the monastery . They " sat down , " and by the time a commission representing the Patriarch arrived , the monks had dug themselves in for a siege . Deir-el-Moharrak , 14 centuries old , has heavy 15-ft. walls , is accessible only by means of a drawbridge to an adjacent building . Within it are live cattle , fresh wells , well-stocked larders . At week 's end , armed monks patrolled the walls while police , dispatched by the Governor of Assiut at the Patriarch 's request , pondered the ultimatum that any attempt to storm the monastery would be met with deluges of boiling water .
